1,4,2008-01-23,Ms. WATSON.," Today, I join my colleagues, Madam Speaker, to override  the President’s veto of H.R. 3963, which  the President vetoed on December 12.  Since then, we received more discouraging news regarding the growing domestic and global economic crisis. It is  imperative that we look at the impact  of the downturn on our Nation’s children. A  slowing economy will definitely lead to an increased demand nationwide for SCHIP services.  Overriding  the President’s veto of  SCHIP is more critical than ever during this period of economic downturn. I  urge my colleagues to join me to override the President’s veto and to guarantee that sufficient funding levels to  address the need of our Nation’s uninsured children become a reality.  f  ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE  (Mr. STEARNS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2008
2,4,2008-01-23,Mr. STEARNS.," As Congress  contemplates an economic stimulus package to aid our slowing economy, we  also must commit ourselves to reduce  Federal spending.  As American families tighten their  budgets to weather this impending economic storm, Congress should match  their sacrifice. While reducing taxes is  important, another aspect is to control  the Federal deficits, the Federal spending. A decrease in wasteful spending  would directly increase the value of the  dollar and ultimately lower deficits.  The American people and businesses  are better at deciding what to do with  their money than the Federal Government. With more money in their hands,  an increase in investment in our economy and in increase in personal savings would take hold and ultimately  lead to a stronger and growing economy.  As we in Congress consider this one-  time stimulus package over the next  few weeks, I contend that a long-term  solution to this problem is to lower  spending, which will in turn lead to  lower taxes and a permanent economic  bounce and revitalization.  f  FIGHTING POVERTY  (Mr. JEFFERSON  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2008
3,4,2008-01-23,Mr. JEFFERSON.," Madam Speaker, I  rise to thank Representative BARBARA  LEE for passing her resolution yesterday committing our Nation to  fight  poverty.  Nowhere is this commitment and action needed more than in the City of  New Orleans.  Ironically, on the day  that the levees broke in New Orleans,  21⁄2years ago, the Census Bureau was  releasing its report on poverty, showing that Orleans Parish had a poverty  rate of 23.2 percent, seventh highest in  the 290 large counties in America. Thirty-five percent of the city’s African  American population  is classified as  poor. Seventy-seven percent of the students  in New Orleans participate  in  free or reduced-cost  lunch programs.  Pre-Katrina African Americans made  up 67 percent of New Orleans, but 84  percent of its population is below the  poverty line. And it is mostly in its 47  neighborhoods  of  extreme  poverty  where our citizens are still out of town,  unable to return and share in the rebuilding of New Orleans.  So the commitment of our Nation  must not be just to recover the City of  New Orleans, but also to focus on the  peculiar needs of its impoverished citizens, needs  existing  before Katrina  made much more desperate since.  f  ECONOMIC STIMULUS  (Mr. HERGER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2008
4,4,2008-01-23,Mr. HERGER.," Madam Speaker, today’s economic debate should focus on  big picture tax policies that emphasize  sustained  prosperity  for  American  workers and their families.  A  one-time,  consumption-driven  stimulus may be popular, but what we  really need is tax relief that will energize economic growth. We need certainty for our industry which is currently making  tomorrow’s  business  plans today based on the assumption  that taxes are going to increase dramatically.  We should also reduce tax rates on  our companies  from the highest tax  rates in the world to instead placing  American employers on an even tax  footing globally.  Madam Speaker,  today’s  economy  didn’t happen overnight, and tomorrow’s growth and prosperity will depend on our commitment to bold, forward-looking tax policies now.  f  ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam  Speaker, I have risen several times on  the floor of the House to encourage my  colleagues to consider the mortgage  crisis when we talk about an economic  stimulus package.  It is well known that an economic  stimulus package should stimulate and  it should be driven by existing law. But  there is no reason why we cannot find  a connector for a 90-day moratorium, a  moratorium on those who are about to  go over the brink and provide a freeze  on those adjustable rates. An economic  stimulus package is to stimulate. What  more stimulation than for people to  keep their homes and pay their mortgages.  Might I also say that as the mortgage collapse goes, then families are  subject to not having their children  covered by the SCHIP program. The debate today will be enormously important because it will cost less than $3.50  a day to provide for these children. And  as well, it will help States all over the  Nation, including the 1 million children  in Texas  that no  longer have  health insurance because of this horrific veto.  We need a stimulus package that provides people with housing and a stimulus package that takes care of our  children.  f  b1045  THE BEST ECONOMIC STIMULUS IS  A JOB  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2008
5,4,2008-01-23,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Madam Speaker,  I think we all know that the best economic stimulus is a job. It is a job that  you can sink your teeth into, that you  can go to work every day and you can  use this job to provide for your family.  So, as the debate ensues, let’s keep our  focus on how policies affect the environment  in which  job growth takes  place. Of course we all want to see  lower marginal rates on our income tax  rate. We want to lower cap gains. We  want to lower the corporate tax rate.  We want to see full and immediate section 179 expensing for our small businesses.

6,11,2008-01-23,Mr.  CAMP  of Michigan.," Madam  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I think it’s important to note that  this bill allows States to document  citizenship, and  the Social Security  Administrator has said that changing  the law will make it easier for illegal  immigrants to get SCHIP funds as well  as other taxpayer-funded benefits.  And despite this being a program for  low-income children, under  this bill  three-quarters of a million adults will  still be on the program in 2012. Under  this bill more than 1.6 million children  will lose their private coverage.  And let’s talk about the funding. The  majority has created a  funding cliff  that  dramatically  increases Federal  funding to enroll new children for the  next 5 years; then cuts funding for the  bill by 80 percent. This will force future  Congresses to make a very difficult  choice: to dramatically increase funding or let American children lose their  health coverage.  The other problem with this bill is  that it is estimated that the bill, because  it relies on tobacco taxes  for  funding, would require more than 22  million new smokers. Now, if there is  any consistent policy the government  has had administration to administration it’s the discouragement of smoking. Yet this bill relies on a false funding mechanism that would require 22  million new smokers.  Madam Speaker, at this time I yield  2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. PRICE.  (Mr. PRICE of Georgia asked and was  given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2008
7,11,2008-01-23,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," I appreciate  the  gentleman’s  leadership  and his  yielding time.  Regrettably, Madam Speaker,  the  New Year didn’t bring any new ideas or  new strategy on the part of our majority here. Less than 1 week into this  new session, it remains all politics all  the time. And you don’t have to believe  me. Just listen to their chairman, who  was quoted in the New York Times on  September  17 of  last year:  ‘‘If  the  President vetoes this bill, it’s a political victory for us.’’ So all politics all  the time.  As has been stated by others, we  solved this issue for the time being, the  next 18 months, in a bipartisan manner  last year, 411–3. And don’t believe me if  you don’t want to. Believe the Atlanta  Journal-Constitution, no great friend  of our side of the aisle, which says,  ‘‘Thanks to the infusion of Federal dollars, Georgia’s embattled health insurance program for working class children is safe for another year and even  has room to grow if the economy declines. The program called PeachCare,  which was disrupted and debated last  year by State officials, Congress, and  the President, will have enough funding to cover the 254,820 children now  enrolled and to grow by up to 40,000  children.  ‘I’m just relieved,’ said the  State  Health  Department  Commissioner Dr. Rhonda Medows. ‘This will  ensure these children are taken care  of.’  ‘‘Relief echoed Monday through the  Georgia health care advocacy community, which fought throughout the last  year to save the program known as  SCHIP. ‘The advocacy community can  do nothing but rejoice.’’’ And these  comments have been voiced all around  the Nation.  Last Thursday the Congressional Research Service issued a statement to  Georgia officials  that  said  that  the  State will receive $325 million for the  2008  Federal  budget,  which  runs  through October of this year, and that  funding level is expected to continue  through March of 2009.  So this isn’t about policy. This isn’t  about policy. It’s all about politics,  self-admitted on the other side.  Vote ‘‘no.’’  ",2008
8,11,2008-01-23,Mr. DINGELL.," Madam Speaker, at  this time I yield for the purpose of  making a unanimous consent request  to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEE).  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to revise and  extend her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam  Speaker, I rise vigorously to oppose the  President’s veto because of the 1 million children in Texas and the City of  Houston that will be left out in the  cold without health care.  Madam Speaker, as the chair of the Congressional Children’s Caucus,  I  rise  to announce that I will proudly cast my vote in support of overriding the Presidential veto of H.R.  3963,  the  ‘‘Children’s Health  Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2007.’’ I  rise  in strong support of  this  legislation because I am listening, and responding to the  will of  the American people. Last November  2006, Americans went to polls by the millions  united in their resolve to vote for change. They  voted for a new direction and a change in the  Bush administration’s disastrous neglect of the  real needs of the American people, particularly  children who lack health insurance through no  fault of their own. The new Democratic majority heard them and responded by passing H.R.  976, ‘‘State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2007.’’  The President vetoed the bill, basing his decision on the absurd and laughable claim that  the program was thinly disguised ‘‘socialized  medicine’’ and that it was too costly to provide  health insurance for America’s needy children.  The  President’s  senseless  veto  of  the  SCHIP bill suggests that this administration is  operating under  the misimpression  that  it  is  entitled to a continuation of the ancien re´gime  under which the Republican-led Congress look  askance and gave  the President a blank  check to mismanage the affairs of our Nation.  Following  the President’s  first veto,  the bill  was revised  to meet a number of concerns  raised by  the President  including ensuring  lower-income children are enrolled  first and  ensuring benefits are denied  to  illegal  immigrants. While the bill again passed the House  by a bipartisan vote of 265 to 142, moving to  the Senate where it passed by a veto-proof 64  to 30, the President again vetoed the bill and,  in so doing, denied health care to millions of  deserving American children.  No matter how many veto threats the President issues, this Congress is not going to give  him a blank check to escalate and continue  the war in Iraq or to ignore the pressing domestic needs of  the American people.  It  is  long past time for change in Iraq and in the direction of the United States. Just as the people and Government of Iraq must accept responsibility for their own country, the people’s  representatives  in Congress must  take  the  lead in addressing the real problems of real  Americans living in the real world.  H.R. 3963 is a necessary step in the right  direction because it provides dependable and  stable funding for children’s health insurance  under Titles XXI and XIX of the Social Security Act in order to enroll all 6 million uninsured  children who are eligible for coverage today,  but not enrolled. That is why I strongly support  this legislation.  Madam Speaker, next to the Iraq war, there  is no more  important  issue  facing  the Congress, the President, and the American people  than the availability of affordable health care  for all Americans, especially children. This bipartisan SCHIP bill  is supported by an astounding 81 percent of the American people  and the majority of Congress.  By vetoing the bipartisan SCHIP Authorization Act, the President vetoed the will of the  American people. By vetoing that legislation,  the President turned a deaf ear and a blind  eye to the loud message sent by the American  people last November.  I voted to override the President’s veto because I can think of few goals more important  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:40 Mar 27, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD08\RECFILES\H23JA8.REC H23JA8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008

12,18,2008-01-23,Mr. HOYER.,"  I  thank  the  guished Republican whip.  On Monday the House will meet at 2  p.m. for legislative business. Votes will  be postponed until 5 p.m., and that  evening we will receive the State of the  Union address from the President.  On Tuesday the House will meet at  10:30 a.m. for morning-hour debate and  12 noon for legislative business. We will  consider several bills under suspension  of the rules. A list of those bills will be  announced by the close of business this  week.  In addition, we will consider H.R.  1528, a bill to designate the New England National Scenic Trail.  The House will not be in session for  the balance of the week in order to accommodate  the Democratic  Caucus  Issues Conference.  I yield back.  ",2008
13,18,2008-01-23,Mr. BLUNT.," I thank the gentleman  for that information. As he and I discussed last week, the FISA legislation  that passed with, obviously, a bipartisan majority in early August expires  on February 1. I think the Senate intends to bring that up on Thursday,  and Senator REIDhas suggested a commitment from the Speaker to bring a  bill up next week. I wonder if we have  any information on that.  I yield.  ",2008
14,18,2008-01-23,Mr. HOYER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  I have not talked to Senator REIDnor  the Speaker about any commitment  about bringing that bill up on Thursday. First of all, of course, next Thursday we won’t be here, if they bring it  up Thursday.  ",2008
15,18,2008-01-23,Mr. BLUNT., I think he’s going to  bring it up this Thursday on the Senate  side is what I meant.  ,2008
16,18,2008-01-23,Mr. HOYER.," Well, as you know, he  may do that. As you know, Leader  REIDasked for unanimous consent yesterday for a 30-day extension of the  present act which expires on the 1st of  the month. Mr. MCCONNELL, the minority leader, objected to that extension.  Furthermore, obviously, the Senate  has not completed its work so that we  are unable to go to conference at this  point in time on the bill that we passed  now some months ago, or over a month  ago.  When the present Protect America  Act, which we passed in August, time  frame comes to an end the 1st of the  month, of course the intelligence community will not go dark. The authorizations  issued  under  the  Protect  America Act are in effect for up to, as  you well know, a  full year, so that  those matters that have been approved  for  interception will not  terminate.  Those authorizations do not terminate  on the 1st of February; so that hopefully the administration has requested  authorization for any and all targets  that it believes are important for us to  be intercepting at this point in time.  And certainly, if they know of any,  they ought to be requesting such authorization  in contemplation of  the  possibility. If the Senate doesn’t act,  we won’t have a bill to pass.  I want to tell my friend that, according to a New York Times story today,  Kenneth Wainstein, who’s the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, he said that if PAA, the Protect  America Act, were allowed to expire,  intelligence officials would still be able  to continue intercepting, he said eavesdropping, on already approved targets  for another 12 months. That is what I  was asserting, and that’s the basis on  which I make that assertion.  The Protect America Act only requires that the AG adopt guidelines for  surveillance, as you know, rather than  the individualized warrants to get 1-  year authorization. These authorizations do not require the NSA to specify  the name, number or location of the  people they want to listen to, so that  the situation we will find ourselves in,  should the Senate not act or be able to  act on Thursday either passing legislation or sending it to us, would be simply that the NSA and the administration would be relying on the authorizations they already have.  I would hope that if the Senate cannot act and that we could not go to  conference, that we could agree on this  side to a 30-day extension and send  that over to the Senate. They failed to  do that on unanimous consent, so it  would give us time to go to conference,  because, as my friend knows, there is  obviously  substantial controversy  in  the other body with reference to how  the immunity issue is addressed. There  is  substantial  controversy  in  this  House about how that question should  be addressed. And very frankly, I was  hopeful that the Senate would act long  before this, I know you’ve been in a  similar situation, and that we would be  in conference and try to resolve those  differences. We haven’t been able to do  that.  Under no circumstances do we think,  however, that the fact that February 1  comes and goes without the passing of  either an extension or new legislation  will undermine the ability of the NSA  and the administration to continue to  eavesdrop on those targets that it believes are important to focus on for the  protection of our people and our country.  b1300  ",2008
17,18,2008-01-23,Mr. BLUNT.," I thank the gentleman  for his views on that, and I would hope  that the Protect America Act is not allowed to lapse. I’m not as comfortable  as the article that my good friend referred to or this article may have created comfort for him and other information, particularly about any new  targets that might fit some past definition that arose. We’ve debated this before; we will debate it again.  I would think that allowing this act  to expire on the basis that somehow we  have a 12-month window would not be  something that either I would be comfortable with or the intelligence community would be  comfortable with.  And we would have another day to debate that.  I do hope we continue to work both  to resolve this issue permanently. The  issue of immunity is an issue that’s  been out there long enough now that  we should be able to bring it to some  resolution, and I hope we can find a  way to do that; and I would hope we  could find a way to do that before February 1, which would almost require  action next week. I understand that if  the Senate doesn’t bring their debate  that would be initiated this week to  some conclusion, it’s hard for us to get  that permanent solution at that time  frame.  But I do think a permanent solution  is important here, and I don’t have the  confidence that my good friend does  that we would have a lot of time beyond February 1 where there  is no  harm by not having the ability to look  quickly in those areas involving foreign  individuals  in  foreign countries  who come to our attention that are not  to our attention today, but I would  yield.  ",2008
18,18,2008-01-23,Mr. HOYER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding. I understand his concern.  Obviously what concerns me is the  proposition, as the gentleman puts forward, that we make sure we have the  authorization to intercept those communications which may pose a danger  to the United States and to our people.  I would hope and urge this administration if they know of any such targets, that they  immediately request  authorization under  that,  and  they  have another week essentially to do so.  We believe those could be approved  within, as some previous Justice Department official said, hours of application.

19,25,2008-01-23,Mr. KELLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of House Resolution 916, offered by the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI).  This resolution  increases the awareness of Catholic education while honoring the contributions of America’s  Catholic schools.  January 27 through February 2, 2008  has been designated Catholic Schools  Week, an annual tradition in its 34th  year and jointly sponsored by the National Catholic Education Association  as well as the United States Conference  of Catholic Bishops. With this resolution we recognize the vital role Catholic elementary and secondary schools  play  in providing an education with  high standards of quality and excellence to the nearly 2.4 million students  enrolled in Catholic schools across the  country.  According to the U.S. Conference of  Catholic Bishops, Catholic schools have  a graduation rate of over 98 percent,  and about 97 percent of Catholic high  school graduates go on  to post-secondary  training  at  4-year  colleges,  community  colleges,  or  technical  schools. This success can be attributed  to the importance Catholic educators  place on  character and morals. By  making the development of moral and  social values an integral part of the  curriculum, Catholic schools are ensuring that their students are not only  good academicians but also good citizens.  The theme for Catholic Schools Week  2008  is  ‘‘Catholic Schools Light  the  Way.’’ This theme highlights the mission of Catholic schools to provide a  faith-based education that supports the  whole  child  academically  and  spiritually and prepares students for future  success.  Catholic  schools  demonstrated  an  enormous  amount  of  character  and  compassion  in their response to the  devastating hurricanes  that hit  the  gulf coast 3 years ago. In the wake of  this  national  disaster, more  than  300,000 students were displaced  from  their homes, schools, and communities.  Catholic schools opened their doors and  hearts and welcomed these students  into their classrooms. They provided  these children with the opportunity to  continue their studies without stopping to consider the cost of that education. Instead, the Catholic schools  knew their first priority was to educate these children. In addition, the  Catholic schools in New Orleans have  proved to be most resilient by becoming some of the first schools in the hurricane-damaged area to reopen their  doors to students.  I appreciate the great work done by  Catholic schools, their administrators  and teachers, as well as the parents  and volunteers. Catholic schools carry  out their servant mission by building  the academic achievement, character,  and values of their students.  I again commend the gentleman from  Illinois for introducing this resolution  and urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2008

22,25,2008-01-23,Mr. GINGREY.,"  I  thank  the  gentleman from Florida for yielding and I  thank Ms. SA´NCHEZand Mr. LIPINSKIas  well, and I rise today in strong support  of H. Res. 916 honoring the contributions of Catholic schools across the  country, for the upcoming commemoration of National Catholic Schools  Week from January 27 to February 2.  Mr. Speaker, as a graduate of Catholic elementary and high schools, Sacred Heart Academy and Aquinas High  School in Augusta, Georgia, I am keenly aware of the contributions that they  provide  to  the  2.3 million  students  across this country they teach every  year. These include 1,176 students at  three Catholic schools in my district,  the 11th of Georgia: St. Catherine of  Siena  in Kennesaw, Georgia; St. Joseph’s in my hometown of Marietta,  Georgia; and St. Mary’s in Floyd County, Rome, Georgia.  Not only do Catholic schools, like Sacred Heart and Aquinas, provide a  strong and competitive academic environment, they also teach moral and  ethical standards, skills for living and  self esteem, and a Christian integration of spirit, mind, and body in each of  their students.  b1345  Upon  graduating  from Aquinas,  I  thought that the Catholic school curriculum would be what best prepared  me for my future. But, Mr. Speaker, I  must admit that I was wrong. While  the  strenuous  academics  at Sacred  Heart and Aquinas did lay the foundation for success at Georgia Tech and  the Medical College of Georgia, it was  the faith and ethical standards taught  at these schools that truly prepared me  for life’s struggles.  Mr. Speaker, while opening and running my medical practice, the respect  for life at Sacred Heart and Aquinas  led me to value and care for life at all  stages from conception on. And now  that I have left my medical career to  serve as Member of this great body, I  find my  lessons  from these Catholic  schools more valuable than ever on a  daily basis.  We are all confronted with difficult  questions that affect millions of lives.  If it were not for the moral standards  and the faith in God taught at Sacred  Heart and Aquinas, I do not believe  that I could properly represent the people of northwest Georgia.

27,25,2008-01-23,Mr. LATTA.," Mr. Speaker, it is my  pleasure to stand before you today in  support of House Resolution 916 honoring  the  contribution  of  Catholic  schools to the education system of this  country.  In Ohio, approximately 12 percent of  school children are educated by private  institutions with  the vast majority  going  to  Catholic  schools.  These  schools provide the structure and value  system that are  important to their  families as their children receive not  only a quality education but a strong  moral and social foundation.  Most  importantly, the choice of a  Catholic education allows children to  have a religious bearing in their education. Many parents make great sacrifices for their children’s education by  sending them to Catholic school, because at the same time they are not  only paying  for  that Catholic  education, but they also have to pay taxes  to the public schools.  I applaud the hard work and dedication  of  the  staff  at  the Catholic  schools, as well as the parents who  seek this education  for their child’s  betterment. I am pleased to support  House Resolution 916 today and to support our Catholic schools in Ohio and  across this great country.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2008

30,32,2008-01-23,Mr. HONDA.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in support of H. Res. 932.  This resolution signifies Congress’s appreciation for the critical work school counselors  do to provide students and their families with  guidance and support, both academic and  emotional, toward obtaining a higher education  and entrance into the workforce.  In his 2008 budget, President Bush proposed eliminating federal support for elementary and secondary school counselors. Under  Democratic  leadership,  the President’s proposal was wisely rejected and this Congress  provided nearly $14 million of additional support to school counseling programs, for a total  of over $48 million. I am proud of this accomplishment, but  feel  there  is still more  to be  done to meet the needs of our children.  In California, eight in nine high school students attend a school with fewer counselors  than  the national average. This makes California the State with the highest counselor to  student ratio in the Nation; over two times the  School Counseling Association’s  suggested  ratio. Students attending intensely segregated  minority  schools are most  likely  to attend  schools with  fewer counselors  than  the national average. Addressing  the school counselor deficit is a critical component of closing  the achievement gap that plagues our Nation.  As we reflect on  the vital role counselors  play in the lives of our children, we should remember that investing in our schools is an investment in our future; it is the best investment our country can make.  School counselors create pathways to success and H. Res. 932 will ensure our Nation  comes  together  this February  to  recognize  their vital contributions.  ",2008
31,32,2008-01-23,Mr. EHLERS.," Madam Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 932 to express support for school counselors and the designation  of the week of February 4 through 8, 2008, as  ‘‘National School Counseling Week.’’  I  thank Representative LINDASA´NCHEZ for  introducing this timely resolution and for allowing me  to collaborate with her on  it.  I also  thank the many Members of Congress that decided to cosponsor this resolution, especially  Chairman MILLER and Ranking Republican  MCKEON.  School counselors are instrumental in helping our students face daily challenges. They  help develop well-rounded students by guiding  them through their academic, personal, social,  and career development.  School counselors also play a vital role in  ensuring that students are prepared for their  future. They may encourage students to pursue challenging academic courses to prepare  them  for  college majors  and  careers  in  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.  I certainly recognize that school counselors  contribute  to  the success of students  in our  schools, and I encourage all Members to join  me in supporting this resolution.  ",2008

Res.  852) raising awareness and encouraging  prevention of stalking by establishing  January  2008 as  ‘‘National Stalking  Awareness Month,’’ as amended.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:  H. RES. 852  Whereas an estimated 1,006,970 women and  370,990 men are  stalked annually  in  the  United States and, in the majority of such  cases, the person is stalked by someone who  is not a stranger;  Whereas 81 percent of women, who are  stalked by an  intimate partner, are also  physically assaulted by that partner, and 76  percent of women, who are killed by an intimate partner, were also stalked by that intimate partner;  Whereas 74.2 percent of stalking victims  reported that the stalking partner interfered  with their employment, 26 percent of stalking victims lose time from work as a result  of their victimization, and 7 percent never  return to work;  Whereas stalking victims are  forced to  take drastic measures to protect themselves,  such as relocating, changing their addresses,  changing their identities, changing jobs, and  obtaining protection orders;  Whereas  stalking  is a crime  that cuts  across race, culture, gender, age, sexual orientation, physical and mental ability, and  economic status;  Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal  law and under the laws of all 50 States and  the District of Columbia;  Whereas rapid advancements in technology  have made cyber-surveillance the new frontier in stalking;  Whereas there are national organizations,  local victim service organizations, prosecutors’ offices, and police departments that  stand ready to assist stalking victims and  who are working diligently to craft competent, thorough, and innovative responses  to stalking;  Whereas there is a need to enhance the  criminal justice system’s response to stalking and stalking victims, including aggressive investigation and prosecution; and  Whereas  the House  of Representatives  urges the establishment of January 2008 as  National Stalking Awareness Month: Now,  therefore, be it  Resolved, That—  (1) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that—  (A) National Stalking Awareness Month  provides an opportunity to educate the people of the United States about stalking;  (B) all Americans should applaud the efforts of the many victim service providers,  police, prosecutors, national and community  organizations, and private sector supporters  for  their efforts  in promoting awareness  about stalking; and  (C) policymakers,  criminal  justice officials,  victim  service  and human  service  agencies, nonprofits, and others should recognize the need to  increase awareness of  stalking and the availability of services for  stalking victims; and  (2) the House of Representatives urges national and community organizations, businesses in the private sector, and the media  to promote awareness of the crime of stalking through National Stalking Awareness  Month.

Res. 852, joining the strong  bipartisan effort to raise awareness in  the toll that stalking takes on our society. Every year, stalking affects approximately 1.4 million Americans of  both genders, all races, ages, sexual  orientation, disabilities, and economic  status.  The consequences of stalking are serious. Stalking can paralyze the victim  with fear, which is well founded, because stalking often leads to physical  attacks from the victim. Indeed, the  overwhelming majority of States, the  District of Columbia, and the Federal  Government not only recognize stalking as a crime, but categorize it as a  felony.  Stalkers cause their victims severe  emotional distress, including anxiety,  insomnia, social dysfunction and depression, all of which can affect all aspects on a person’s life, including family, social activities and work. In fact,  the emotional distress is so disabling  that  11 percent of  stalking victims  have  been  forced  to  relocate  their  homes, 30 percent report seeking psychological counseling, and 74 percent  report being stalked  in a way that  interferes with their employment.  Of course,  the ultimate  threat of  stalking is to the victim’s very life.  Over 75 percent of women murdered  by  an  intimate  partner  had  been  stalked by that partner, and 54 percent  of female murder victims had reported  being stalked to police before being  killed by their stalkers.

40,39,2008-01-23,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 3971,  the Death in Custody Reporting Act of  2007, and commend Chairman CONYERS,  Crime Subcommittee Chairman SCOTT,  and  Crime  Subcommittee  Ranking  Member GOHMERT for their commitment to this bipartisan legislation.  The Death in Custody Reporting Act  of 2000 directed the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics to  collect data on deaths that occur in the  process of arrest or during transfer  after arrest, as well as deaths that  occur in jails and prisons.  H.R. 3971 reauthorizes this data collection program and directs the Attorney General to commission a study to  determine how to reduce deaths in custody and to examine the relationship  between deaths  in custody and  the  management of jail and prison facilities.  The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that between 2001 and 2005 there  were 15,308 State prisoner deaths. The  bureau also reports that there were  5,935 local prisoner deaths and 43 juvenile deaths between 2000 and 2005.  Half of all State prisoner deaths are  the result of heart disease and cancer.  Two-thirds involved inmates age 45 or  older, and another two-thirds are the  result of medical problems that were  present at the time of admission.  Although illness-related deaths have  slightly increased in recent years, the  homicide and suicide rates  in State  prisons have dramatically decreased  over the last 25 years. That is positive  news, but we still need to collect data  to monitor these trends.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2008
41,39,2008-01-23,Mr.  SCOTT  of  Virginia.," Madam  Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlelady from Texas,  a member of the Judiciary Committee,  Ms. JACKSON-LEE.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. I thank  the distinguished gentleman, the chairman of the subcommittee that I have  the privilege of serving on, the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on  the House Judiciary Committee.  I thank the full committee chairman,  Mr. CONYERS, the ranking member on  the  full committee and the ranking  member on the subcommittee for having two  important  initiatives, and I  speak to the underlying bill which addresses the question of death in custody, H.R. 3971.  I, too, want to applaud the fact that  the existence of this legislation is a  strong statement that, in spite of individuals  being  incarcerated  in  the  criminal justice system, in the penal  system,  in  the prison  system,  that  there is a responsibility; one for the  safety and security of those who are incarcerated, particularly, as well, that  younger and younger  individuals are  going into our criminal justice system  of which we hope to address as we look  to these  issues  in the coming year,  work that has already been done in  this committee. We hope to see some of  that legislation come to fruition.  I  do want  to  speak  specifically,  Madam Speaker, to the concerns that I  see in the State of Texas. And it may  be symbolic of many States, particularly  large States that have a very  large penal system and a criminal justice system, if you will, or incarceration rate, and say that this legislation, in addition to reporting or requiring reporting of the deaths and suggesting  the  ineligibility  for  funds,  which I think is an important statement, some instances of holding the  particular jurisdictional head responsible for some of, in this instance, the  deaths of individuals held in their particular facilities.  For example, about 3 weeks ago, in  Houston, an individual was seen being  neck-choked by a custodian in the Harris County  jail  in Harris County  in  Houston, Texas, and subsequently that  inmate lost their life. This has been an  increasing occurrence  in  the Harris  County jail. And certainly there have  been occurrences in the whole State  system, but we have a county jail system which people are either held for  trial or either they are actually serving their time there, and in the last  decade we’ve had 106 deaths, plus, in  the Harris County jail. Many of them  have come about through the inability  to secure medicine, to secure medical  care. One instance is an individual in  his own pool of blood, and the, if you  will, caretaker, the guard, was asked to  get relief and he said, What do you expect for me to do, get a Band-Aid?  So in some instances the deaths are  caused because of such horrific occurrences, such egregious occurrences that  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:40 Mar 27, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD08\RECFILES\H23JA8.REC H23JA8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008
42,60,2008-01-23,Mr. WALZ of Minnesota.," Well, anyone who listens tonight, Madam Speaker, to the gentleman’s accounts is horrified. And I think to put it into context, make no mistake about it, what  happened today in the signing of the  Department of Defense authorization  bill with these provisions taken out to  allow recourse on this is, it is pretty  difficult for me to see any way that a  decision was made to side with the  monsters who carried out this torture  and not with those brave Americans  who went at this country’s call, did our  bidding, and then came home to the so-  called open arms. And as  the gentleman said, having spent 24 years in  the National Guard, having  trained  countless soldiers, many, as you said,  served in my unit. I taught them in  school. I coached them on the football  field. One of the things that was very  clear in part of our training, because,  of course, it held to those core values  of being an American, was the respect  for the Geneva Convention.  The Geneva Convention did several  very  important things. As I said,  it  upheld those principles of, even in a  conflict situation, that the humanity  and the humane treatment of other individuals was absolutely paramount to  keeping with the ideals of this Nation.  There was also something else very,  very important with the Geneva Convention that many of us as soldiers always came to rely upon  is knowing  that if you adhere to these things, that  if other combatants, the enemy you  were fighting understood that, one of  the things you could do was you could  convince people that it might be better  to give up the fight. It might be better  because you know you will be treated  humanely. And there was always great  comfort, because it is not the fear of  injury, it is not the fear of battle which  is there amongst all these soldiers, it is  the fear of capture and torture and saying something that may hurt your fellow soldiers that has everyone terrified.  So the idea is that the Geneva Convention was held in the highest esteem.  The principles that it was set by were  there to make sure that even at the  base emotions of war amongst human  beings that there was a respect  for  basic human life. There was a respect  when someone was unarmed and unable  to fight, that when someone was captured, they would be treated as humanely as possible. And with  that  being pulled back, I have to tell you, it  terrifies me.  And these forgotten warriors are forgotten because they happen to be an  inconvenience now. They happen to be  an  inconvenience to a political  ideology. They happen to be an inconvenience  because  this  administration  doesn’t want to follow the Geneva Convention. This administration, I believe,  and members of this administration  have called it a quaint, outdated notion that is no longer there. I would  argue that soldiers don’t see it that  way. Soldiers see it as a necessity.  And for many of us, as my colleague  has pointed out, it is hard to fathom  that an administration that has talked  so much about our soldiers would so  callously brush aside 17, in this society, 17 warriors held in the highest esteem as a prisoner of war for their Nation and to cast them aside and cut  their rights off to any type of recourse.  And I can’t help but see a pattern here  of where the administration’s loyalties  lie. As Americans are struggling, and  we hear about it every day, the economic crisis, they are struggling to  make ends meet, and they see $102 a  barrel oil. But I don’t know where that  is able to be rectified in their mind  when they see the President walking  hand in hand with the Saudi Prince  and knowing that every bit of that $102  is going into the pockets of the Saudi  Princes, going into nations and going  into, in this case, a regime that committed the grievous atrocities against  our soldiers and was totally absolved  down on Pennsylvania Avenue against  the wishes of the 100 elected Senators,  against the wishes of the 435 elected  Members of this body. And yet tonight,  several of us stand here. And I think  the outrage and the passion that my  colleague from Iowa has shown should  be reassuring to the American public  that there is a voice there. There is a  voice  in  the wilderness. There  is a  voice that says this is wrong. This is a  wrong that should not be allowed to  stand. This is a wrong that I think  they want to see, my colleague from  Iowa, myself and our colleagues here,  stand and speak for what is right.  So again, I can only come to the conclusion, and I ask my colleague if he  can find another way of seeing this,  what was the benefit of the administration’s decision to side with the Hussein  regime over U.S. POWs who were tortured? I am still trying to find where  there  is  justification.  It doesn’t go  back to  ‘‘we can’t hamper the Iraqi  from rebuilding,’’ because they are not  doing that as it is. It can’t go back to  any precedence. It is in violation of the  Geneva Convention, and it flies in the  face, as my colleague said, of our basic  principles of our Constitution. So I am  trying to figure how we would be able  to sell this to the American public.  ",2008
43,60,2008-01-23,Mr. BRALEY of Iowa.," Well, Madam  Speaker, I think my friend from Minnesota has hit this one on the head, because one of the things you were talking about is the administration’s interpretation of what our treaty obligations are under the Geneva Convention.  And maybe it all boils down to this  very simple question: When is torture  torture? Because you brought up the  fact that our own Government, our own  Justice Department, seems to have a  difficult time interpreting acts such as  waterboarding,  that  I  think  every  American who has seen the video illustrating what that is would conclude  that it constitutes torture in violation  of the third Geneva Convention. And  yet it is hard for us as a people and as  a government to try to say, we need to  stand up to other countries who are  torturing our POWs if we can’t get it  ourselves in terms of our obligations  under the Geneva Convention. I think  it gets to a much more fundamental  question, which is, are we going to be  the type of country that stands by our  word when we enter  in these  international treaties? These treaties are  designed not just to protect American  prisoners of war but to make sure that  the countries that we may be in conflict with have the same respect for  human  rights,  human  dignity  and  human decency for captured prisoners  that we would expect our men and  women in uniform to be subjected to.  To give you some idea of how this  plays out in the real world, I would remind my  friend  from Minnesota of  what happened to Lieutenant Colonel  Berryman, one of the people I identified as the POWs that brought this  claim.  b1800  This really gets to the heart of many  of those constitutional protections I  talked about earlier.  Lieutenant Colonel Berryman was inspected after he was captured to determine whether he was circumcised and  was  questioned  about  his  religion.  When he answered he was a Baptist, his  captors called him a  lying Jew.

So  I expect this bill will be carried over.  But if we can have some amendments  offered this afternoon, still we can debate these amendments, I would like to  ask Senate offices if they have amendments, notify the cloakrooms so we  can put them on a list and have some  notion of what we need to do in order  to get this bill completed.

108,74,2008-01-23,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota is absolutely  right. Having managed a number of  bills, I know that sometimes it is hard  to get people with amendments  to  come forth. I hope they do. Once this  bill is finished, we will go to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or,  as we know it here, FISA. It is intended to protect both our national security and also the privacy and civil  liberties of all Americans. We are considering amendments to that  important act that will provide new flexibility to our intelligence community.  We all support surveillance authority.  With terrorists plotting against us and  talking about it, we want to be able to  use all the various electronic and other  means to find out what they are saying. Unlike some in the administration  who say we are dealing with an antiquated law, we have updated this act  many times, probably 30 or more times  since its historic passage after intelligence abuses of earlier decades.  I came here 34 years ago. I well remember that this Nation was still reeling  from  the  excesses  of  the  COINTELPRO when people were being  spied on by their Government simply  because they disagreed with what the  Government was doing; in this case,  the war in Vietnam. We enacted FISA  so we could do the legitimate thing of  actually spying on people who wanted  to do harm to the United States at the  time of the Cold War, when we had adversaries all over the world. We also  wanted to make sure that Americans  who were minding their own business,  not doing anything illegal, wouldn’t be  spied upon.  We  rushed  the  so-called  Protect  America Act through the Senate just  before the August recess and with it  were a number of excesses. They came  about  because  the  administration  broke agreements it had reached with  congressional leaders. The bill was hurriedly passed under  intense partisan  pressure from the administration. In  fact, the pressure was so strong, they  made it very clear why they were willing to break agreements with those Republicans and Democrats who had been  working together to try to craft a bill  that would protect America’s interests  but also protect the privacy of individual Americans.  So we passed a bill that provides  sweeping new powers to the Government to engage in surveillance, without a warrant, of international calls to  and from the United States involving  Americans, and it provided no meaningful protection for the privacy and  civil  liberties of the Americans who  were on those calls. It could be an  American calling a member of their  family studying overseas. It could be a  business person who, as they travel  around to various companies they represent, ends up having their telephone  calls intercepted.  But before that flawed bill passed—  the one that came about because of the  broken agreements by the administration—Senator ROCKEFELLERand I and  several others in the House and Senate  worked hard, in good faith with the administration, to craft legislation that  solved an identified problem but, as I  said, protected America’s privacy and  liberties.  Just before the August recess the administration decided  instead to ram  through  its  version  of  the Protect  America Act with excessive grants of  Government authority and without any  accountability or checks and balances.  They did this after 6 years of breaking  the  law  through  secret warrantless  wiretapping programs. It was one of  the most egregious things I have seen  in my 34 years in the Senate. First  they violate the law, and then instead  of being held accountable, they ram  through a law designed to allow them  to continue those actions. Some of us  saw  it  for what  it was and voted  against  it.  Both  Senators  from  Vermont voted against it. We are from  a State that borders a foreign country.  We are concerned about our security,  but we are also concerned about our  liberties and our privacy.  We did manage to include 6-month  sunset in the Protect America Act so  we would have a chance to revisit this  matter and do it right. The Senate Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence  Committee, as well as our House counterparts, have spent the past month  considering changes. In the Senate Judiciary Committee we held open hearings. We had more briefings than I can  even count and meetings with the administration, with people in the intelligence service, with people at the CIA,  NSA, and others. We considered legislative language in a number of open business meetings where Senators  from  across the political spectrum could be  heard. Then we reported a good bill to  the Senate before Thanksgiving.  The bill we are now considering will  permit  the Government, while  targeting overseas, to review more Americans’ communications with less court  supervision than ever before. I support  surveillance of those who might do us  harm, but we also have  to protect  Americans’ liberties. Attorney General  Mukasey said at his nomination hearing that ‘‘protecting civil liberties, and  people’s confidence that those liberties  are protected, is a part of protecting  national security.’’ Let me repeat what  the new Attorney General said:  Protecting civil liberties, and people’s confidence that those liberties are protected, is  a part of protecting national security.  I agree with him. That is what the  Judiciary Committee bill does. I commend the House of Representatives for  passing a bill, the RESTORE Act, that  takes a balanced approach to these  issues and allows the intelligence community great  flexibility  to  conduct  surveillance of overseas  targets but  also provides oversight and protection  for Americans’ civil liberties. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  has also worked hard. I know Chairman  ROCKEFELLERwas as disappointed as I  at the administration’s partisan maneuvering just before the August recess. After being here through six administrations, it has always been my  experience, with Republican or Democratic  administrations  at  certain  points, when you are negotiating a key  piece of legislation with the administration, you have to rely on them to  keep their word and be honest with  you, as they have to rely on you to  keep your word and be honest with  them. Through six administrations, 34  years, I can never remember a time  where  an  administration  was  less  truthful or flatly broke their word in  the way this one did.  I commended the efforts of Senator  ROCKEFELLERand those working with  him. I do so again now. I believe both  he and I want surveillance but we want  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:16 Mar 19, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€8SENATE\S23JA8.REC S23JA8 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2008
109,81,2008-01-23,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  thank the chairman of the committee  for his great cooperation on this very  important  issue. I know we had all  hoped—certainly my constituents had  hoped, and I think my colleagues as  well, as so many around the country  who have been waiting years—literally  waiting a decade—for reauthorization  of this Indian Health Care Improvement Act. We are pleased that we are  on the floor. We would like to see this  moved through the process as quickly  as possible. We understand the issues  we have in front of us and what we  have to do in order to get this through,  but I appreciate the great leadership of  the chairman of  the  Indian Affairs  Committee and of so many who have  worked to advance this legislation.  I thank Chairman DORGAN for reminding all of us of the great contributions we have had from so many of our  American  Indians,  Alaska  Natives,  when it comes to serving our country.  I think if you look at the demographics  and look at it on a per-capita basis, we  see higher numbers, certainly in Alaska, of our Alaska Natives serving in  the military  than any other populations in the State, serving admirably  over the years, whether they be the Eskimo Scouts or whether they be the  group serving from the National Guard  which recently returned from Kuwait.  I had an opportunity a couple of  months ago to meet those Alaskans  who were returning.  I met up with  them in Camp Shelby and had an opportunity to talk to the men who were  returning from Kuwait after well over  a year. They had been in the desert.  Most of these soldiers came from villages  from around the State. There  were some 80 villages—communities—  that were  represented amongst  this  particular unit. Many of them, when  they returned back home to Alaska  after coming from the desert and going  home to the snow, would be returning  to very small towns and very small villages that are not connected by any  form of a road system. During the winter months, you have connection because the rivers are now frozen and you  can take a snow machine to get from  one small village to another and hopefully out to a larger hub community.  But the reality is so many of these fine  men who have served our country are  going back to areas where health care  options are very limited.  Yesterday I had an opportunity to  show my colleagues a couple of pictures.

114,88,2008-01-23,Mr. REID.," Madam President, there  has been a lot of progress made on this  Indian health bill that is now before  the Senate. A number of amendments  have been filed. The staff are negotiating further provisions and discussing  a list of amendments for consideration  when we return to the bill.  I extend my appreciation to Senator  and Senator MURKOWSKI, the  chairman and  ranking member,  for  their leadership on the floor.  Many compromises have been made  to accommodate my Republican colleagues—on Federal Torts Claims Act  coverage  of  traditional health  care  practitioners,  on urban  Indian  programs, and on the need for an Assistant  Secretary of Indian Health. We even  accommodated our colleagues when we  learned  of  their midweek  retreat,  which has interrupted debate time on  this important bill.  The caucuses are discussing  some  final issues, and I will be developing a  list of amendments that we should consider relating to this legislation. I hope  these conversations continue so we find  a way to complete the bill in a timely  and efficient manner.  As an original cosponsor of the Indian health bill, I am committed to  seeing an Indian health bill signed into  DORGAN The  law and will continue to work with  Senator DORGAN, Senator MURKOWSKI,  and my Republican  counterpart  to  complete this  legislation as soon as  possible.  ",2008
115,88,2008-01-23,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Madam President, I  am  pleased  to  support  the  Indian  Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007. This bill is long overdue,  and I hope that we in the Senate can  ensure this bill’s quick passage.  There are significant unmet needs in  Indian Country  throughout  this Nation, and addressing the unmet health  care needs ranks as one of the most  significant  issues  that we must address. The Federal Government has a  well-established  trust  responsibility  with regard to American Indian affairs,  and this trust responsibility extends to  providing good health care to communities throughout Indian Country.  I am impressed with the bipartisan  work that Senator DORGAN and the  Senate Indian Affairs Committee have  put into moving this bill forward, and  I commend the committee for its dedication to significant consultation with  Indian Country in drafting and negotiating this bill. Because of the strong  consultation with individual tribes and  collective organizations  like the National Tribal Steering Committee and  the National Indian Health Board, the  Senate Indian Affairs Committee has  put together a comprehensive reform  bill that will help improve the health  care services available to American Indians around the country.  This bill has the support of tribal  governments throughout the Nation,  including the 11  federally recognized  tribes in my State of Wisconsin. I have  heard from a number of constituents in  Wisconsin about the need to pass this  important piece of legislation and the  improvements that the legislation will  make to various Indian Health Service  programs including clinical programs,  on the various reservations throughout  the State and the urban Indian program in the city of Milwaukee.  Health care is consistently the No. 1  issue that I hear about all over my  home State of Wisconsin. When I hold  my annual townhall meetings across  the State, many people come to tell me  about problems with our overall health  care system, and data shows us that  these problems are often most acutely  felt in Indian Country. Lack of access  to good health care is a problem that  disproportionately  affects  American  Indians throughout the United States.  According to the Indian Health Service, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 200 percent more likely to die  from diabetes, more than 500 percent  more  likely to die  from alcoholism,  and approximately 500 percent more  likely to die from tuberculosis.  I was disappointed to hear one of my  colleagues say yesterday on the floor  that American lives do not depend on  whether we pass the Indian health care  bill by the end of the month.

He has  not had time to study the amendment.  He has been busy all day, as have all  my Republican colleagues at their retreat. But he will have time to work on  this tonight. His staff is working on it.  We hope tomorrow to have a couple  hours of debate, and then it is my understanding there could be and likely  will be a motion to table this amendment.  I want to make sure Senators have  adequate time to debate this amendment tomorrow. This is, if not the key  amendment, one of the key amendments to this legislation, and we want  to make sure everyone has adequate  time. We are going to come in early in  the morning and start this matter as  quickly as we can. So I am not going to  ask consent tonight as to how much  time will be spent on it, but this will  be the matter we take up tomorrow.  I have  spoken  to Senator WHITEHOUSE, who is a member not only of the  Judiciary Committee but also the Intelligence Committee. He has a very  important amendment he wishes  to  offer. It is a bipartisan amendment he  has worked on for a significant period  of time, and we look forward to this  amendment.  Hopefully, we  can work our way  through  some  of  these  contentious  amendments tomorrow. It is something  we need to do, and we are going to  work as hard as we can. There are  strong feelings on each side. Everyone  has worked in good faith. I especially  appreciate the cooperation of Senator  LEAHYand Senator ROCKEFELLER.

123,109,2008-01-23,Mr. SPECTER.," I ask unanimous consent that the attached letter to the  Honorable Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary-  General of the United Nations, dated  January  17,  2008, be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  U.S. SENATE,  Washington, DC, January 17, 2008.  Hon. BANKI-MOON,  Secretary-General of the United Nations,  United Nations Headquarters, New York, NY.  DEARSECRETARY-GENERAL: By letter dated  January 2, 2008, 1 requested that the United  Nations initiate an investigation into the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. With this letter, I am  enclosing for you a copy of that letter and  would appreciate a response.  After considering the matter further and  watching developments, it is my view that  the United Nations should organize a standing commission to investigate assassinations  which would have international importance.  We are seeing terrorism, supplemented by assassinations,  becoming  commonplace  to  achieve political objectives.  While a United Nations investigation into  the assassination of former Prime Minister  Bhutto  is still something that should be  done, it would obviously have been much  better to have had a unit in existence which  could  be  immediately  dispatched  to  the  scene to investigate the locale as soon as  possible and to interrogate witnesses while  their memories are fresh and before others  might try to stop them from talking.  I would very much appreciate your response on these important matters.  Sincerely,  ARLENSPECTER.  f  SPECTER STATE SECRETS PROTECTION ACT  ",2008
124,109,2008-01-23,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, yesterday, Senator SPECTER and I introduced  the State Secrets Protection  Act. I have been working on this bill  with  Senator  for  several  months, and I thank him for his commitment and leadership on this very  important issue. I hope that our collaboration on this legislation will demonstrate that even the most sensitive  problems can be addressed through bipartisan cooperation if we keep the interests of the Nation front-and-center  and roll up our sleeves to do the work  of seeking a realistic and workable solution. The State Secrets Protection  Act is an essential response to a pressing need.  For years, there has been growing  concern about the state secrets privilege. It is a common law privilege that  lets the Government protect sensitive  national  security  information  from  being disclosed as evidence in litigation. The problem is that sometimes  plaintiffs may need that information to  show that their rights were violated. If  the privilege is not applied carefully,  the Government can use it as a tool for  cover up by withholding evidence that  is not actually sensitive. The state secrets privilege is important, but there  is a risk it will be overused and abused.  The privilege was first recognized by  the Supreme Court in 1953, and it has  been asserted since then by every administration, Republican and Democratic. Under the Bush administration,  however, use of the state secrets privilege has dramatically  increased and  the harmful consequences of its irregular application by courts have become  painfully clear.  Injured plaintiffs have been denied  justice, courts have failed to address  fundamental  questions  of  constitutional rights and separation of powers,  and confusion pervades this area of  law. The Senate debate on reforming  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act has become far more difficult than  it ought to be because many believe  that  if courts hear  lawsuits against  telecommunications  companies,  the  courts will be unable to deal fairly and  effectively with the Government’s invocation of the privilege.  Studies show that the Bush administration has raised the privilege in over  25 percent more cases per year than  previous  administrations  and  has  sought dismissal  in over  90 percent  more cases. As one scholar recently  noted, this administration has used the  privilege to ‘‘seek blanket dismissal of  every case challenging the constitutionality of specific, ongoing government programs’’ related to its war on  terrorism, and as a result, the privilege  is impairing the ability of Congress and  the judiciary to perform their constitutional duty to check executive power.  Another  leading  scholar  recently  found that  ‘‘in practical terms, the  state  secrets privilege never  fails.’’  Like  other  commentators,  he  concluded that ‘‘the state secrets privilege  is the most powerful secrecy privilege  available to the president,’’ and ‘‘the  people of the United States have suffered needlessly because the law is now  a servant to executive claims of national security.’’  In 1980, Congress enacted the Classified  Information  Procedures  Act—  known as CIPA—to provide Federal  courts with clear statutory guidance  on handling secret evidence in criminal  cases. For almost 30 years, courts have  effectively applied that law to make  criminal trials fairer and safer. During  that period, Congress has also regulated judicial review of national security materials under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Because of  these laws, Federal judges regularly review and handle highly classified evidence in many types of cases.  Yet,  in civil cases,  litigants have  been left behind. Congress has failed to  provide clear rules or standards for determining whether  evidence  is  protected by the state secrets privilege.  We have failed to develop procedures  that will protect injured parties and  also prevent the disclosure of sensitive  information. Because use of the state  secrets privilege has escalated in recent years, there is an increasing need  for the judiciary and the executive to  have clear, fair, and safe rules.  Many have recognized the need for  congressional guidance on this issue.  The American Bar Association recently  issued a report ‘‘urg[ing] Congress to  enact  legislation  governing Federal  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:16 Mar 19, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€8SENATE\S23JA8.REC S23JA8 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2008
125,137,2008-01-23,Mr. FORBES.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to recognize my pastor and dear friend, Rev.  Charles L. Moseley on the occasion of his retirement  from nearly 40 years of service as  pastor of Great Bridge Baptist Church  in  Chesapeake, VA.  Charles Moseley was born in Camden, SC,  the fifth child and only son of Fred and Julia  Moseley. Growing up in a small town, Charles  felt the influence of his godly mother and father. One evening in October 1949 after a revival service at First Baptist of Camden, while  Charles and his  friends were watching an  eclipse of the moon, he felt the call of God to  full-time Christian ministry.  Charles started his higher education achieving his associate of arts degree from Wingate  Jr. College in January 1952. He went on to receive his bachelor of arts degree in English  from Coker College  in January 1954. Continuing to be led by the Lord, Charles then entered Southeastern Seminary at Wake Forest,  NC, and graduated with a bachelor of divinity  in January 1958. He later earned a master of  divinity  from Southeastern Seminary  in  the  early 1970s. Throughout  these years of college, Charles continued to see God’s hand on  his life in many ways through financial help,  mentoring from professors, and preaching in  churches in the area.  During  his  time  at  seminary,  Charles  preached  in many churches but was  led  to  pastor two churches in Dillon County, SC. He  would  travel between  the  two churches on  Sunday preaching at one at 10 a.m. and the  other at 11 a.m. It was during this time in December 1956 that he met his future wife, Louise Martin. At the time, Lou was serving as  education director of the First Baptist Church  of Dillon, SC. They were married  in June  1957.  As a senior at seminary, many offers from  churches came for him to serve as pastor but  Charles was not led to any of them until he received  an  offer  from  a  small  church  in  Valdese, NC,  in early 1958. Abee’s Grove  Baptist was a small country church located in  the mountains of North Carolina with a Sunday morning attendance between 100 to 150  people.  Pastor Moseley and his  family  left  this  church in 1962 to begin a ministry at the First  Baptist Church of Carthage, NC. Located near  Pinehurst, NC, First Baptist was a dignified little church with a beautiful pipe organ, stained  glass windows and friendly congregation.  From the beginning of his studies, Charles  had  the desire  to be a chaplain  in  the Air  Force but that was not the Lord’s path for him.  He did however, serve in the National Guard  and proudly retired  from  the U.S. Army Reserve with 23 years of service.  Even  in  the  beginning  of  his ministry,  Charles had always thought he would be the  pastor of a small church, never imaging that  the Lord would lead him to shepherd a large,  vibrant, and growing church. However, in 1969  Charles and his family felt the call to Great  Bridge Baptist Church, a church of 650 members  in  a  rural  area  near Norfolk,  VA.  Throughout his ministry at Great Bridge Baptist, Pastor Moseley has always maintained  that he  is a pastor  first, serving his people  wherever their needs are. His greatest desire  is  to  be  a  servant  reaching  out  to  his  congregants  during  their most  important  times—marriage, birth, death, crisis, sickness,  sorrow, fear, joy.  When asked what he would say is a highlight of his ministry at Great Bridge Baptist,  Pastor Moseley recalled that one of the greatest of his delights  is experiencing someone  coming  to know  the Lord. The blessing of  leading a person  to know Christ as his/her  Savior is the joy of his life.  Madam Speaker, in the nearly 40 years of  service at Great Bridge Baptist Church, Pastor  Moseley has steadfastly led his congregation  in the footsteps of Christ, touching thousands  of lives with the joy and peace of the Lord.  Through the many years that my family and I  have attended Great Bridge Baptist,  I have  come to know Rev. Moseley as a model of  selfless service and great spiritual leadership.  Today we thank him for his service to us and  most importantly his service to the Lord and  we ask God’s special blessing on him and his  family as they pursue the joys and challenges  of this next phase of his life.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

DONALD A. MANZULLO  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 23, 2008  ",2008
127,137,2008-01-23,Mr. MANZULLO.," Madam  Speaker,  last  week, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO,  released  its  report outlining options  for  reLIPINSKI,  ERIC BILL CANTOR, WALLY  sponding to the Nation’s short-term economic  weakness. One key finding of the report contains a warning: Any stimulus that a short-term  economic package ‘‘can provide to the economy depends on how much of the resultant  spending goes to purchase domestically produced goods. The degree of stimulus that a  policy can provide  to  the economy also depends on how much of the resultant spending  goes  to  purchase  domestically  produced  goods. If the additional consumption, or investment, demand is satisfied by imported goods,  the income of foreign producers will rise, and  the stimulus essentially will be exported.’’  Simply put,  the benefits of  the proposed  $145 billion U.S. economic stimulus package  should not go abroad. The benefits of  this  package should help Americans as much as  possible. That’s why I, along with Representatives  HERGER, and JEFFFORTENBERRY, am proud to  introduce  today  the American Jobs Creation  and Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. This bill  will provide a quick power boost to the economy that does not cost too much and rewards  companies  for keeping and adding  jobs  in  America. This proposal simply accelerates the  phase-in of  the domestic manufacturing  tax  benefit by 2 years. Any economic stimulus  package that is crafted by Congress should include this provision.  The domestic manufacturing tax deduction,  now section 199 of the U.S. Tax Code, started  in 2005 at 3 percent as part of the 2004 law  that replaced the Foreign Sales Corporation/  Extraterritorial Income, FSC/ETI tax structure,  which was ruled as an illegal export subsidy  by the World Trade Organization, WTO. Last  year, the domestic manufacturing tax deduction increased to 6 percent. The final phase—  raising the domestic manufacturing deduction  to 9 percent—is scheduled  to start  in 2010.  The American Jobs Creations and Economic  Stimulus Act of 2008 simply changes the start  date of the 9 percent domestic manufacturing  tax deduction from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2008,  thus providing an additional 3  percent tax incentive for all domestic manufacturers right now.  According to the Internal Revenue Service,  IRS, 378,627 small and large manufacturers,  as broadly defined by the U.S. Treasury, were  helped by this benefit in 2005. One year later,  that number grew  to over 400,000. The domestic manufacturing benefit applies to firms  of all types—C Corporations, S Corporations,  Limited Liability Companies, LLCs, and sole  proprietorships.  This tax deduction is ideal because it only  applies  to  revenue generated by operations  based in the United States and discourages  the ‘‘off-shoring’’ of American production. No  other economic stimulus idea ties tax relief to  requiring companies  to keep production and  jobs in the United States. The American Jobs  Creation and Economic Stimulus Act of 2008  is a simple bipartisan low-cost idea that will  make a real difference right now. It also fits  within  the parameters, as outlined by  the  President on Friday, of what could be included  in an economic stimulus package.  Madam Speaker, I respectfully urge the inclusion of accelerating the phase-in of the domestic manufacturing  tax deduction  in any  economic stimulus legislation that will be voted  on by the House this year.

129,144,2008-01-23,Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today to honor Hrant Dink. He  was a Turkish-Armenian journalist and a defender of the freedom of the press. His belief  in  this  freedom never wavered despite his  prosecution and conviction under Article 301  of the Turkish Penal Code, which makes it a  crime  to discuss  the Armenian Genocide.  Sadly, Mr. Dink’s life was taken one year ago  on January 19, 2007.  I am proud to cosponsor H. Res. 102, which  condemns  the assassination of Hrant Dink.  This bill urges the Turkish government to continue  to  investigate and prosecute  those responsible for Mr. Dink’s murder and to protect  the freedom of speech in Turkey by repealing  Article 301. The repeal of this Article will ensure that Hrant Dink’s legacy will live on and  that his death will not have been in vain.

134,6,2008-01-31,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. President, today  is January 31. It is signifying the end  to many things: the end of the month,  maybe we will begin to see a little bit  of spring down the road, but it is also  the end of an amazing career of someone we all know and love, and that is  Marty Paone.  Marty Paone has worked for 32 years  on the Hill, 28 years on the Senate  floor. He started in the House Post Office before working in Senate parking.  He joined the cloakroom in 1979 and  was appointed Democratic Secretary in  1995 by Senator Daschle. He worked  under four Democratic leaders: Senator  BYRD,  Senator  Mitchell,  Senator  Daschle, and Senator REID.  I  think  every one of them would agree with the  word  that  I would use  to describe  Marty Paone—‘‘indispensable.’’  We do not know what we are going to  do without Marty here. He has been  such an amazing presence, so knowledgeable; not only about the rules of  the floor but just about how this body  works. I know Senator REID relied on  him for just about every kind of advice.  Again, his advice was indispensable.  I am particularly appreciative of his  kindness to me when I was a new Senator, teaching me the way the place  worked, helping me realize when there  would be votes so I could time my  schedule. As most of you know, I like  to be busy, but I hate to miss votes, as  everybody else. And he was just the  most knowledgeable, decent, kind, indispensable person around here.  Now Marty is leaving. We really are  going to miss him. We are going to  miss his dedication to this institution.  I think if you made a list of the people  most dedicated to the Senate, Marty  Paone would be in the top 10 or 20 in all  our history.  We  are  going  to miss  his  ever-  present—he hovered in the background  quietly—omniscience, always knowing  what was going on, and always being  there to help. We are going to miss  Marty  just as a person who,  in his  quiet, droll way,  is actually a very  funny guy.  I want to wish Marty the best. I  think I speak on behalf of 100 Senators  and everyone who served previously. I  thank his wife Ruby  for putting up  with the long hours. I know because I  would call Marty at home on weekends  much of the time asking him for advice  or when there might be a vote or this  or that. His three kids, Alex, Stephanie, and Tommy—Stephanie is at William & Mary, Alex goes to VCU, and  Tommy is still in high school. And a  particular hello, because I have heard  she  is watching, to Marty’s mother  Evelyn Paone.  Mrs. Paone, God gave you 95 years,  and let’s hope he gives you many more.  I know you are so proud of Marty,  maybe even a little prouder than we all  are.  Marty, we will miss you, we thank  you, we love you. Good luck, Godspeed.

138,6,2008-01-31,Mr. ENSIGN.," Mr. President, I rise  today with a truly heavy heart. At Arlington Cemetery, on January 17, 2008,  I attended the funeral services of my  friend,  COL  D’Arcy  Grisier.  Our  thoughts and prayers are with his wife  beloved Roberta, or, as we call her,  Bert, and their three children Sean,  Kelly, and Darcy.  D, as he was called by his friends,  was a caring father, loving husband,  and a member of my extended family.  A patriot in every sense of the word, D  spent 26 years serving this Nation in  the U.S. Marine Corps. Upon retiring  from the Corps in 2003, D decided to  continue serving this country in a different capacity.  From 2003 until September of this  past year, Colonel D was my military  legislative assistant. In this capacity D  advised me on all national security  matters, all the while reminding me  that once a Marine always a Marine  and that the ‘‘M’’ in Marine is always  capitalized.  Those of us who were friends with D  will remember him more for who he  was than the  lifetime of service he  gave to this country. My staff and I  will miss D always knowing exactly  what the Redskins were doing wrong.  We will miss him  always  saying  ‘‘keep your seats’’ whenever he entered  a room. We will miss him constantly  singing Jimmy Buffet songs out loud,  and losing at least two sleeves of golf  balls every time he played. We will  miss his laughter and his camaraderie.  Most of all, we will miss his friendship.  Mr. President, if D Grisier knew that  I was making this statement about  him, he would probably be upset. That  was the type of individual he was.  While he would not have wanted this  attention, Americans deserve to know  D’s story and the caliber of person who  spent a lifetime serving them.  This past summer at our annual staff  retreat Colonel D announced that he  would be leaving the office to go and  work in the Pentagon as the Deputy  Under Secretary of Defense for Budget  and Appropriations. This was bittersweet for many of us.  We were thrilled for D, of course, but  sad to see him go. Unfortunately, he  was never able to report to work for his  new job, a challenging position that he  looked forward to starting.  During his tenure on Capitol Hill he  had many accomplishments, which D  referred to as ‘‘doing the people’s business.’’  These accomplishments included advising me in my role as chairman of  the  Senate  Armed  Services  Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support.  In this capacity, he drafted legislation and amendments, wrote numerous  floor statements, staffed me  in high  level meetings, advised me on billion-  dollar spending bills, and, on occasion,  voted my proxy, or what D would refer  to his role as, the ‘‘extremely junior  Senator from Nevada.’’  He spent a great deal of time in Nevada at our military bases and meeting  with veterans. D also took great care  in helping the families of our State’s  fallen heroes. He moved mountains in  order to relieve some of the stress and  anxiety  they  face at  such difficult  times.  After D announced to the office that  he would be leaving for the Pentagon  he told a short story. I believe this  story reflects the type of  individual  that he truly was.  D told us that the professional accomplishment he was most proud of  was bringing a Junior ROTC program  to Douglas High School.

144,20,2008-01-31,Ms. SNOWE.," Madam President, first  of all, I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator BAUCUS, and  our ranking member, Senator GRASSLEY, for their combined tireless leadership in advancing a very critical piece  of legislation, the stimulus bill that  has been passed by the Finance Committee and will be considered by the  Senate shortly. I thank them for spearheading such an important initiative in  a very timely fashion. It is an issue of  critical consequence to the Nation.  We know there is a decline in our  economy. We are seeing the economic  indicators, which I will speak to shortly. There is no doubt that across the  board  it  is absolutely vital that we  enact as quickly as possible a stimulus  package to begin to address the erosion  we have identified and that we have  seen in our economy.  Again, I thank the chairman of the  Finance Committee and the ranking  member for working so quickly to address many of the issues raised on this  very comprehensive piece of  legislation, understanding that some of the  issues  that  have  been  raised—even  since the time in which the House of  Representatives had voted upon their  package, they also incorporated many  provisions that I think are more targeted and will strengthen the bill that  passed in the House of Representatives  and the bill that had been negotiated  between the House and the President.  I do think it is important for the  Senate to have the opportunity to have  its input on this bill that is going to be  so vital to America and to our constituents and to make sure it is as precise and calibrated as possible in order  to rejuvenate the economy and, hopefully, to galvanize some of the economic dimensions of our economy that  have taken a turn for the worse.  It  is  imperative that we act  in a  timely fashion. I think changing the  package and incorporating those issues  that are also essential to build upon  the strengths of the legislation that  passed in the House of Representatives  are not mutually exclusive. We cannot  afford to stand idly by as the economy  continues to erode. That is why I think  there is a collective conclusion that we  have to develop a package that can be  supported in both the House and Senate and will be signed by the President.  The Finance Committee held a number of hearings recently on the question as to whether to even have a stimulus package. I know there is debate on  both sides of the political aisle and  among economists as to whether it is  essential. But the fact is, more than  half of the economists surveyed in this  country believe there  is a recession  that  is  imminent. So, obviously, we  have a responsibility to take every possible step and every possible measure  that can avert or at least mitigate the  impact and the brunt of any recession.  Dr. Martin Feldstein, former chair of  the Council of Economic Advisors for  President Reagan, expressed his support for a stimulus plan. Last week, before the Senate Finance Committee, he  said:  Because of current credit market conditions, there is a risk that interest rate cuts  will not be as effective in stimulating the  economy as they were in the past. That is  why a stimulus measure deserves our attention.  It certainly deserves our attention  and our informed decisions, in terms of  what exactly should be considered in a  stimulus package. No doubt, time is of  the essence—we all agree on that—in  passing a viable and effective piece of  legislation. But our obligation, as well,  is to be deliberative on one of the  issues that is of great consequence to  this country.  We have to develop the best possible  package, building upon the strength of  the House measure, and it must be targeted to those who need the support;  and we need to rebuild the economy  and, hopefully, avert any potential recession. We have to strike the right  balance because, obviously, that will be  central to averting a recession, avoiding it, as we face a confluence of historic and unprecedented economic indicators that are profoundly troubling.  We can anticipate more than $600 billion in resets in the adjustable rate  market  in  the  spring, which  is, of  course, on top of all the resets that  have occurred recently. We are experiencing a housing crisis. Recently, the  Commerce Department indicated that  the drop in home prices is at the lowest  since they began keeping records  in  1963. Likewise, the price of oil per barrel has now skyrocketed and spiked recently to $100 per barrel. Gasoline is  approximately $3 at the pump, and we  can anticipate, according to a report  even of today, that it may go as high  as $3.50 per gallon. The number of long-  term unemployed today is nearly twice  the  rate of  the unemployed  immediately prior to the recession of 2001  and 2002, when we extended unemployment benefits. So we have seen the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:04 Feb 01, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G31JA6.033 S31JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2008
145,34,2008-01-31,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I rise today  to recognize the distinguished and respected  career  of Senate Librarian  Greg Harness, who retires today.  Librarians  serve  as  bridges,  connecting information and resources with  those who need it. They are charged  not only as the keepers of knowledge  but also as the distributors of it, and it  is a duty that Greg has upheld in the  most respectful, prompt, and accurate  manner. Members of the Senate and  their staff have come to rely on the  vast resources that Greg oversees and  know that each request for information, no matter how small it may seem,  will be treated with the same courtesy  and professionalism.  Greg came to the Senate Library as a  reference librarian in 1975, intending to  stay only 2 years. Instead, Greg found  his niche in the Senate Library, where  he has worked for 32 years. He served  in a variety of capacities over his tenure, transitioning to an assistant librarian position in 1995 and finally to  Senate Librarian in 1997. One of his  most  important  contributions  was  moving the Senate Library from the  Capitol Building to the Russell Senate  Office Building in 1999. Greg not only  helped facilitate the move, but he also  oversaw the design of the new library.  It is also worth noting that over the  course of Greg’s career, the field of librarianship has been transformed by  new technology. In 1975, the Senate Library was the first Secretary of the  Senate office to receive computers, allowing researchers to access information more quickly. For the Senate Library, this necessitated the need for research  librarians who are not only  knowledgeable  of  traditional  paper-  based resources but are also masters of  electronic resources. Greg understands  this balance and has assembled a qualified staff to fulfill this need.  From personal experience I can attest that Greg’s tenure has been a welcome addition to the Senate Library’s  distinguished  tradition  of  providing  legislative,  historic,  and  general  knowledge to all that it serves. The  Senate has been privileged  to have  Greg’s expansive wealth of  intellect  and wisdom. I thank him for all the  services he has provided  to me,  to  other Members of the Senate, and to  Senate staff. His service will be truly  missed, and I wish him the best in his  new endeavors.  f  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR TRENT  LOTT  ",2008
146,34,2008-01-31,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, I want  to take this opportunity to say a few  words about my friend and colleague,  Senator Lott.  Senator Lott has compiled a long and  distinguished career in public service  on behalf of the people of Mississippi  and our Nation. He has been a tireless  advocate on behalf of the needs of his  State and its people, particularly in  light of the devastation wrought by  Hurricane Katrina. Senator Lott also  fought for our men and women in military uniform to ensure they have the  best  training,  equipment, and  technology available. Throughout his career, he believed that the American  people should be able to keep more of  their own money instead of sending it  to Washington. Finally, Senator Lott  understood and appreciated the fact we  need judges on the Federal bench who  will uphold the law, not make the law.  During his time in the Congress, he  has been an active participant in many  important  legislative  battles.  The  votes he has cast and the policies he  supported have made the State of Mississippi and our Nation a better place.  Senator Lott is in a select group of  individuals who have held leadership  positions  in both the House of Representatives and Senate. He has served  as House minority whip, Senate majority leader, Senate minority leader and  Senate minority whip. His election to  these important leadership positions in  both bodies show a high level of trust  and respect from his colleagues.  With his departure the Senate will  lose one of its most effective Senators  and the people of Mississippi will lose a  powerful advocate. I truly appreciate  his leadership, service in the Senate,  and service in the House of Representatives, wit, wisdom, and friendship.  I wish him the best of luck in all future endeavors.  f  TRIBUTE TO MARTY PAONE  ",2008
147,34,2008-01-31,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to offer a few words of appreciation and to say ‘‘Farewell’’ to one of  the Senate’s  finest public  servants,  Marty Paone.  For our visitors in the gallery, and  for our viewers on C–SPAN,  it may  look  like Senators are running this  place. Mr. President, we know better.  We trust dedicated, professional staff  like Marty Paone to make sure things  get done.  As all of my colleagues know, Marty  is the secretary for the majority, and  when we were fewer Democrats around  here, he was our secretary for the minority. He has held this position for  the past  13 years. Before  that, he  served  as  the  assistant  secretary,  worked as floor staff and in the cloakroom, going back nearly three decades.  In short, Marty has spent close to his  entire adult life here on the Senate  floor, getting Senators where they need  to be, when they are supposed to be  there.  To do his job, Marty has to be a combination of traffic cop, diplomat, and  parliamentarian—and he has to have  the trust of the Senators who follow  his direction. Marty has that trust, because he has earned that trust, and because he has all those other skills, too.  I have been here 35 years; it is hard  for me to remember a time when Marty  wasn’t here. And I don’t just mean year  in and year out. I mean any hour of the  day and night. Whenever this place is  open for business, Marty has been here,  helping to maintain order and to get  things done. We are  indebted to his  many personal sacrifices, when he was  here instead of home with his family.  Indeed, it has been hard to get much  done around here without relying on  Marty’s expertise on Senate process. I  don’t know how he has managed to juggle all the demands on him. He is the  ‘‘go to guy’’ for help on moving amendments, overcoming objections, getting  a place in line for debate, complying  with Senate rules, strategizing passing  or defeating a measure. If you want to  know what is happening ‘‘behind the  scenes,’’ Marty is the person to look to.  There isn’t a vote that happens, there  isn’t a negotiation that takes place,  there isn’t a unanimous consent agreement—which is what makes this place  function—that Marty hasn’t helped to  piece together or made sure it’s done  correctly.  And Marty works  for each of us.  While, technically, he works  for the  Democrats, I know that many of my  Republican colleagues have turned to  Marty for guidance. He is known for always being candid and straightforward.  He has served us all with his honest  counsel—you could always count on  him  for a straight answer. And, remarkably, he has never lost patience  with any of us—no matter what we ask  or how often we call.  It is hard to describe to those who  haven’t spent much time in the Senate  how very important Marty Paone has  been to the Senate, day-to-day life and  historic moments. Mr. President, this  is the end of an era. We all hope it will  be  the beginning of a new one  for  Marty, away from the heavy responsibilities he has met so well for so long.  We wish him well. He will be missed  very much.  f  ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2007—  SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS  ",2008

156,4,2008-02-08,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, we are  back on the floor beginning the third  week of debate on the very important  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,  also known as FISA. We have had a  great deal of good debate. We have had  a few votes.  Thanks  to our  leadership—Senator  REIDand Senator MCCONNELL—we now  have a plan to conclude debate and go  to the critically  important votes on  Tuesday. I thank all Members for participating. I know there are some who  have comments  they wish  to make  today and Monday. Chairman ROCKEFELLERand I have spent 21⁄2weeks so  far on the floor, and we understand the  importance of moving quickly to get  this measure adopted—gain approval  from the House on a measure we can  send to the President for his signature.  I truly hope we can make that.  I express my thanks to Chairman  his  assistant Melvin  Dubee, all members of the committee,  Louis Tucker of my staff, and others  for bringing us to this position.  It is important to realize the magnitude of the danger we continue to  face  from radical  Islamic terrorists.  Probably no place was it better outlined than in testimony in open hearing by the leaders of the intelligence  community. Director McConnell, head  of  the  intelligence community, outlined  the major  areas  of  concern,  backed up by CIA Director Michael  Hayden; Defense  Intelligence Agency  Director General Maples; FBI Director  Mueller, and Under Secretary of State  Randy Fort for the INR.  A couple things that came out may  have been missed by Members who  were not fortunate enough to hear the  testimony of Admiral McConnell and  the intelligence community. I thought  I would repeat a few of them for you.  First, Admiral McConnell made it clear  that even though our intelligence analysts had the availability of collection,  which indicated there had been a halt  in 2003 to the weaponization program  for nuclear weapons in Iran, the threat  that Iran poses remains great. Admiral  McConnell pointed out that there is no  question Iran continues to try to enrich uranium, which can be used for  ROCKEFELLER,  nuclear weapon production. He also indicated they have the skills and the facilities  to  turn  out  biological  and  chemical weapons, and they are working on a missile program. The halt in  2003 came, not surprisingly, after the  United States went in and opposed the  dangerous dictator, Saddam Hussein.  It was the capture of Saddam Hussein  that led Muammar Qadhafi, leader of  Libya, to decide he didn’t want to be  pulled out of a spider hole by American  forces.  He  gave  up  his  nuclear  weaponization program. Personally, I  think it is no accident that the same  activity in Iraq convinced Iran that,  for the time being, it was better to  shut down  their weaponization program. The top French Defense Minister  indicated he was not sure they had not  restarted their weaponization program.  In any event, we need to continue to be  concerned about Iran and its potential  threat not just to our allies in the Middle East,  particularly  Israel, which  Iran’s elected  leader, Ahmadi Nejad,  vowed to annihilate.  Specifically, regarding threats to the  United States, General Hayden outlined for us in open hearing—and more  specifically in classified information—  the number of threats that have been  avoided, the plots that have been deterred by our resolute action. And what  helped us deter the threats was, first,  the active, aggressive move by the U.S.  military to disrupt the Taliban and  take Afghanistan out from under the  control of the Taliban.  Afghanistan was a great threat and  much planning was going on by al-  Qaida there. There are some on the  news who continue to say  Iraq had  nothing to do with the war on terror.  For those others who have looked at  the information, that is an unbelievably naive point of view. David Kay,  who went into Iraq to conduct a survey  of our inadequate intelligence information, said that Iraq was a far more dangerous place even than we knew. Terrorists were running wild there, Abu  Mus’ab al-Zarqawi, head of Ansar al  Islam was active there, and later became the AQI, leader of al-Qaida there.  Al-Zarqawi became famous when he beheaded victims who didn’t agree with  him; he cut their heads off on television. Iraq has been designated time  and time again by leaders of al-Qaida,  Osama  bin Laden  and Ayman  al-  Zawahiri, as the target for their headquarters. They want to establish the  land between the rivers—the Tigris and  Euphrates—as  their  caliphate. They  stated that is their objective.  Were we to leave Iraq precipitously,  not only would it lead to chaos, genocide, and possible Mideast sectarian  wars, but also it would ensure that al-  Qaida would have the opportunity to  reestablish their headquarters with recruitment, training, and command and  control  that would  significantly  increase  the  threats  to  the United  States.  This is why it is essential to continue  our military support in the war against  terror and also provide the intelligence  tools to the  intelligence community  needed to keep our country safe.  I thought it might be helpful to repeat a few comments that were made  at that hearing. Director McConnell,  along with FBI Director Mueller, outlined terrorist threats here at home—  most recently, in New Jersey, Illinois,  and abroad in Spain, Denmark, France,  Germany, and the United Kingdom. Admiral McConnell also said:  Al-Qaida remains the preeminent terror  threat against the United States, both at  home and abroad. Despite our successes over  the years, the group has retained or regenerated key elements of its capability, including its top leadership, operation lieutenants,  and de facto safe haven . . . in the Pakistani  border area with Afghanistan known as the  Federally Administered Tribal Areas  or  FATA.  To expand on that further, I will explain that people who think we are not  doing enough to capture Osama bin  Laden and al-Zawihiri, I cannot tell  you how it is happening, but it is happening in collaboration with our allies.  But we have  regularly  captured or  killed the operational head of al-Qaida,  the No. 3 man. Most recently, Abu  Laith al-Libby, the operational head,  was killed in some kind of bomb or  missile strike. At the time, of course,  he had a U.S. citizen with him, apparently, Adam Gadahn, who had been cooperating actively with the al-Qaida  leadership. Now,  it  is  a  fact  that  Gadahn was a top terrorist target. But  do you know something. Without having a FISA Court order, we were able  to go in and kill him—inadvertently, of  course, but we would not have been,  without the FISA law—particularly as  we have updated it—able to listen in on  his  conversations. That  is  the  one  great shortcoming we learned in Iraq  when we met with the head of our  Joint Special Operations Command,  GEN Stan McCrystal. He  said  the  greatest threat to our troops on the  battlefield was not being able to listen  in on their electronic communications  and see what directions they were giving to the terrorist groups threatening  our troops in Iraq. That is why the outmoded, old FISA law we changed with  the Protect America Act had to be revised.  In addition to the terrorist threat,  there is no question that rogue nations  around the world continue to seek dangerous weapons that threaten America’s security. Admiral McConnell also  said:  The ongoing efforts of nation-states and  terrorists to develop and acquire dangerous  weapons, and the ability to deliver those  weapons, constitute the second major threat  to our safety. After conducting missile tests  and  its  first nuclear detonation  in  2006,  North Korea  returned  to  the negotiating  table last year.  We see that North Korea has signed  on to the six-party agreement, supposedly getting themselves out of the  nuclear business, but some of us have  grave doubts whether he will  follow  through.

157,11,2008-02-08,Mr.  R.," Emmett Tyrrell, Jr., in the Washington Times today. He talks about  what Admiral McConnell, the Director  of National  Intelligence, said a  few  days ago in hearings. Director McConnell said:  The number of terrorist attacks and deaths  were greater than in the past six years combined.  He was talking about the battle for  Pakistan and its survival.  The article states:  Another [statement] from ",2008
158,11,2008-02-08,Mr. MCCONNELL  .," . .  is that al Qaeda plans more attacks  against the United States and was working  on a plan for attacking the White House as  recently as 2006. Homegrown al Qaeda cells  here have been primitive, but Mr. MCCONNELL registered his concern that new, more  sophisticated cells might threaten us domestically in the years ahead.  And that is a fair summary, I think,  of Admiral McConnell’s comments.  Since we have now openly  talked  about the waterboarding question, and  Members of Congress and the public  have now gotten the  information,  I  think we need to make sure we know  exactly how those three occurrences  developed.  The first thing we know is it worked.  I hate to say, it worked. No. 2, the  Agency—only  the  CIA  used water-  boarding;  never  the U.S. military,  never the Department of Defense; not  in  Iraq, not  in Afghanistan—it was  never utilized by our military, but the  Central Intelligence Agency on three  occasions since September 11.  As the article says, they utilized it  only on those:  [T]error leaders who have posed the utmost  threat to our [national] security, Abd al-  Rahim al-Nashiri, [who was the] mastermind  of [the] attack on our warship the USS Cole  in a neutral port.  We had hearings in the Armed Services Committee, of which I am a member, about that dastardly attack. And I  remember about a year after the Cole  was attacked—where we had 18 American sailors killed by this vicious attack; and  it could have been a  lot  more—the Navy commissioned a ship  down at Norfolk, VA; and as we walked  out of the ceremony, a young sailor  hollered out—and  it still makes my  hair stand up—‘‘Remember the Cole.’’  Well, we got the perpetrator, and justice was done.  Abu Zubaydah, [who was] the brains behind the thwarted millennium attacks—  That we were able to block—  The attacks on September 11. KSM,  that is his name now for the professionals, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.  So I believe the Attorney General of  the United States, after researching  this matter carefully, and after our intelligence agencies gave it thoughtful  review, concluded we do not need to  have waterboarding now,  that  these  three instances were justified.  Attorney General Mukasey, a former  Federal  judge—approved  overwhelmingly by  the Senate—was asked  to  make an opinion on waterboarding. He  said he believed those actions were justified under those circumstances, and  he would not say we would never ever  do it again in the future. He said circumstances would determine how you  handle those kinds of situations.  Let me note, again, for a lot of people, these are not honest and legitimate soldiers of a nation state. The  people who are subjected to this procedure are persons who are unlawful combatants. They are persons who do not  fight according to the rules of war, and  they do not wear uniforms. They deliberately attack civilian personnel. They  do it through subterfuge and violence,  and their goals are outside all rules of  warfare. Until some recent cases, they  were clearly considered not to be provided any protections under the Geneva Conventions.  So I will say, Madam President, we  hate to talk about these things. We  wish we did not face the kind of threats  from the diabolical terrorists that we  do. We wish we did not have to go to  war and shoot and kill many of them.  But we, as a nation—the Congress; both  parties—have authorized that activity.  We fund that activity. Our soldiers are  out there putting their lives on the line  at this very moment to execute that  policy, placing themselves  in harm’s  way.  I am glad the Attorney General has  reviewed it carefully. I am glad he is  able to say waterboarding was utilized  only three times, that it had not been  used in 5 years. But I am glad he also  said he would not say it would never be  done again. This would be unwise advice to the enemy we face.  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

171,18,2008-02-08,Mr. BIDEN.," Madam President, today,  the Senate considers S. Res. 432, a bipartisan resolution on Darfur cosponsored by myself, Senator LUGAR, and a  number of other colleagues. This resolution urges the members of the international  community,  including  the  United States, to step up to fill a critical need in equipping the joint United  Nations-African Union  peacekeeping  force, namely, 24 tactical and utility  helicopters.  Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has  termed these aerial vehicles indispensable  to allow  the peacekeepers  to  carry out their mission to protect civilians. I am pleased to see that several  countries may now be volunteering to  begin to  fill this gap. According to  press reports, the governments of Ethiopia and Bangladesh are discussing the  matter with the United Nations, and I  hope that their contributions can be  used to help meet this urgent need.  While I want to acknowledge these  potential contributions, I would also  emphasize that other countries must  do  the  same:  the  peacekeepers  in  Darfur need the full complement of 24  helicopters. Darfur is the size of Texas.  These aerial assets are critical. Our  resolution urges President Bush to personally contact other heads of state on  this matter. I have been told that senior officials at the White House and  State Department are continuing to  engage in high-level outreach on this  issue. I respectfully suggest that this  outreach should be elevated to conversations among chiefs of state. The  United States has led the world in efforts to provide assistance to the people of Darfur.

173,18,2008-02-08,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The  resolution  (S. Res.  agreed to.  The preamble was agreed to.  The resolution, with  its preamble,  reads as follows:  432) was  S. RES. 432  Whereas, on August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security Council approved United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706, providing that the existing United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) ‘‘shall take over from  [the African Mission in Sudan (AMIS)] responsibility for supporting the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement upon the  expiration of AMIS’ mandate but  in any  event no later than 31 December 2006’’;  Whereas, on July 31, 2007, the United Nations Security Council approved United Nations Security Council Resolution 1769 reaffirming Resolution 1706 and stating that  the Security Council  ‘‘[d]ecides  . . .  to  authorise and mandate the establishment  . . . of an AU/UN Hybrid operation in Darfur  (UNAMID) . . . [and] [d]ecides that UNAMID,  which shall incorporate AMIS personnel and  the UN Heavy and Light Support Packages  to AMIS, shall consist of up to 19,555 military personnel,  including 360 military observers and liaison officers, and an appropriate civilian component including up to  3,772 police personnel and 19 formed police  units comprising up to 140 personnel each’’;  Whereas, on December 31, 2007, the United  Nations-African Union hybrid mission formally assumed control of peacekeeping operations in Darfur, but did so with only approximately 9,000 troops and police on the  ground, far short of both the authorized and  necessary levels;  Whereas the Government of Sudan continues to obstruct implementation of Security Council Resolutions 1706 and 1769 in several respects, including by refusing to conclude a Status of Forces Agreement or to cooperate on issues such as the force composition, the authorization of night flights, customs clearance, land access, and visas for  staff;  Whereas, on January 7, 2008, uniformed elements of the army of Sudan attacked a  clearly marked UNAMID supply convoy, severely wounding a Sudanese civilian driver;  Whereas  rebels,  militias,  government  forces, bandits, and others continue to prey  upon the people of Darfur and upon humanitarian workers,  increasing the urgency of  both deploying the full complement of peacekeepers and police and of reaching a lasting  political settlement;  Whereas  the  preliminary  results  of  a  United Nations  assessment  entitled  the  ‘‘Food Security and Nutrition Assessment of  the Conflict-Affected Population of Darfur  (August/September 2007)’’ reveal that global  acute malnutrition in Darfur increased in  2007, exceeding emergency levels in some regions;  Whereas the United Nations-African Union  Mission  in Sudan has been hampered not  only by obstruction by the Government of  Sudan and other obstacles to peace in the region, but by the failure of the international  community to commit the resources, equipment, and personnel needed to carry out the  peacekeeping mission, most notably the failure to provide critically needed aviation and  transportation assets;  Whereas the United Nations-African Union  Mission in Sudan needs, among other critical  mobility capabilities  that have not been  met, 18 utility helicopters and 6 tactical helicopters and crews;  Whereas, in a report to the Security Council dated December 24, 2007, the Secretary-  General termed these helicopters indispensable and stated that ‘‘UNAMID must be capable of rapid mobility over large distances,  especially over terrain where roads are the  exception. Without the missing helicopters,  this mobility—a  fundamental requirement  for the implementation of the UNAMID mandate—will not be possible.’’;  Whereas a large number of countries possess the military assets that could help to  fulfill this requirement;  Whereas the United States continues to  lead the world in its contributions to efforts  to end the genocide in Darfur, including by  providing more than $4,500,000,000 since 2004  in response to the Darfur crisis;  Whereas continued failure on the part of  the  international community  to  take all  steps necessary  to generate, deploy, and  maintain an effective United Nations-African Union hybrid peacekeeping force will result in the continued loss of life and further  degradation of humanitarian infrastructure  in Darfur; and  Whereas it would be inexcusable for the  international community to allow an authorized peacekeeping mission intended to  help bring an end to genocide and its effects  to founder or be compromised because of a  failure to commit critical elements, such as  the 24 helicopters needed to meet the critical  mobility capabilities of the United Nations-  African Union Mission in Sudan: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the Senate—  (1) urges the members of the international  community,  including  the United States,  that possess the capability to provide the  tactical and utility helicopters needed for  the United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur to do so as soon as  possible; and  (2) urges the President to intervene personally by contacting other heads of state and  asking them to contribute the aircraft and  crews for the Darfur mission.  f  ESTABLISHING  THE  JOINT  CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE ON INAUGURAL CEREMONIES  AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE  ROTUNDA BY THE  JOINT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE ON INAUGURAL CEREMONIES  ",2008

Mr. Stone is an example of how an ordinary  citizen can make a change to benefit our entire community. Mr. Stone’s involvement with  this issue resulted in the establishment of a  clean water advocacy group committed to improving our water quality and environment.  And that is something we can all be proud of.  The Gallows Hill Watershed Association  was founded by Todd Stone in 2002 and consists of representatives from a wide variety of  private and government groups, all with  the  common goal of  improving our environment.  This group’s educational outreach, scientific  research and active participation in the legal  system effecting local land use have brought  key people together with a shared objective.  Madam Speaker, Todd Stone is an extraordinary example of community advocacy. His  passion for improving our environment and his  tireless community involvement is undeniable.  His work is inspiring and I am honored to recognize him for his many accomplishments.  RECOGNIZING WILLIAM (BILL)  DENISON  HON. JOHN T. DOOLITTLE  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 21, 2008  ",2008
178,4,2008-02-21,Mr. DOOLITTLE.," Madam Speaker, today I  wish to express my warm thanks, congratulations,  and  best wishes  to William  (Bill)  Dennison. Mr. Dennison is being recognized  by the California Board of Forestry and Fire  Protection and will be the recipient of its highest honor, the Francis H. Raymond Award for  his 30 years of service and commitment to the  California forest industry.  After being  raised  in  rural Northern California, Mr. Dennison earned a bachelor of  science degree in forestry from the University  of California, Berkeley in 1959. Bill’s passion  for the forest began while working for the Diamond Match Lumber Company in Stirling City,  and within a  few short years, he became a  registered professional forester.  Mr. Dennison’s knowledge and leadership in  the forest industry set him apart from others  and quickly qualified him to take the reins as  the vice president and later president of the  California Forestry Association (CFA). During  his 14 year tenure, Bill represented the industry both in Sacramento and Washington, DC,  and was able to navigate CFA through some  of the most difficult forest management issues  it ever faced.  Throughout his career, Mr. Dennison has  distinguished himself as a visionary  leader  with the ability to educate the public on the  value  that California  forest products provide.  Bill was a critical member of the Quincy Library Group, helped organize  the National  Forest Counties and Schools Coalition and  later served as the executive director of the  Sierra Cascade Logging Conference.  Although Mr. Dennison’s accomplishments  in the forest industry are legendary, his greatest legacy may be his commitment to advancing forestry education programs and creating a  network  of  forest  community  organizations  known as  the Alliance  for Environment and  Resources that are today the model throughout the country.  Most recently, Mr. Dennison served as the  Third District supervisor  for Plumas County.  He quickly became a national  leader on resource conservation, water quality and rural  management issues while serving as chairman  of  the Public Lands Steering Committee  for  the National Association of Counties.  Bill has served on numerous boards and  commissions and has  received dozens of  community and national awards including: the  Plaque of Commendation by the National Forest Products Association; Award of Appreciation for Services by the National Forest Counties and Schools Coalition; and my  favorite,  selected twice with his wife Pat, as the Grand  Marshall for the Chester Rotary Club Fourth of  July Parade.  It is with deep respect and personal gratitude that I thank Bill Dennison for his service  to  the  forest  industry and  to  the citizens of  Northern California.  CHI MUI POST OFFICE BUILDING  HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 21, 2008  ",2008
179,4,2008-02-21,Mr. SCHIFF.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor a well-respected and dedicated leader in the 29th Congressional District and a role  model in the Asian community, Chi Mui, mayor  of the city of San Gabriel. It is with great pride  that I introduce a resolution today to pay tribute  to Chi Mui, with what may be  the  first  honor of its kind for a Chinese-American, by  naming the San Gabriel, California Post Office  for him.  Born in Toisan, China, on October 26, 1952,  Chi Mui was a man of humble origins whose  early experiences enabled him to relate and  connect to the Asian community in California.  His parents, a seamstress and a cook, left for  the United States in 1963 when Chi Mui was  10 and moved to New York City’s Chinatown.  It was in New York City that Mui learned to  speak English and graduated cum laude with  a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from  Polytechnic University of New York in 1980.  After moving to Southern California in 1980,  Chi Mui began working to better the lives of  immigrants in the region. Chi Mui’s immigrant  roots and experiences gave him special  insight, wisdom and the ability to connect with  the experiences of generations of people who  have come to this country and to San Gabriel  for a better life. Mayor Mui always recognized,  and never failed to pay tribute to, his parents  for their sacrifices and encouragement of their  children’s education and aspirations for the future.  Mui was a key player in the development of  600 units of affordable and senior housing for  Chinatown and taught citizenship to help hundreds of legal residents become United States  citizens. He led the effort to save the 50-acre  ‘‘Cornfield’’ in downtown Los Angeles as open  space, was  instrumental  in organizing  the  Chinatown Yard Alliance, and successfully obtained $35 million from the state in 2001 to  build the first urban state park and community  facilities on the Cornfield.  An avid  runner and athlete, Chi Mui co-  founded the Los Angeles Chinatown Athletic  Association Volleyball Club where he coached  young people in teamwork and sportsmanship.  He  also worked  to  expand  existing  recreational  facilities  in  the Chinatown community. In recognition of his leadership, he was  elected president of the Los Angeles Chinese  American Citizens Alliance—twice. The Alliance was  founded  in 1895  to advocate  for  equal political, economical and educational opportunities for Chinese-Americans.  Active in local politics early on, he was a  field representative for Rep. LUCILLEROYBAL-  ALLARD (D–Los Angeles) when she was in the  Assembly, and he worked for former Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D–Los Angeles) and  State Sen. Gloria Romero (D–Los Angeles). In  March 2003 he made history as the first Asian  and Chinese-American  to be elected  to  the  San Gabriel City Council since its incorporation in 1913.  In a city where one in every two residents  is Asian, Mayor Mui often played an important  role as a liaison between the city government  and the Asian community and he worked diligently to improve the lives of all residents.

181,9,2008-03-04,Ms. CASTOR.," Mr. Speaker, ‘‘Here are no  lofty peaks seeking the sky, no mighty glaciers  or rushing streams wearing away the uplifted  land. Here is land, tranquil in its quiet beauty,  serving not as the source of water, but as the  receiver of  it. To  its natural abundance we  owe the spectacular plant and animal life that  distinguishes this place from all others in our  country.’’  These were the words of Harry Truman, 60  years ago at the dedication of the Everglades  National Park. And it is in the same spirit that  I support H. Res. 845, recognizing  the 60th  anniversary of Everglades National Park. The  Everglades are a completely unique treasure  for Floridians, and all Americans. So it is fitting  that they should also be unique in the national  park system. The Everglades were  the  first  unit of the park system to be designated not  for their scenic beauty alone, but for the extraordinary diversity of their wildlife.  One of the largest bodies of fresh water in  the United States, Lake Okeechobee, sits at  the top of the Everglades. During the wet season, Okeechobee slowly pours water over its  southern edge, and it flows out in a slow flood  that slides south and spreads out over hundreds of square miles. The water flows south,  but very slowly, sometimes as little as a hundred feet in a day. And it is remarkably shallow, as little as a foot in depth, which allows  the incredible diversity of plant and animal life,  unrivaled in the Nation.  In 1947, when Marjory Stoneman Douglas  published  ‘‘Everglades: River of Grass’’ and  Harry Truman dedicated  the Everglades as  part of the parks system, it was with the intention of preserving  the Everglades  for  future  generations. Douglas continued to fight for the  Everglades for the rest of her life, and she led  an ever growing chorus of voices, advocating  for our environment. The Everglades became  a touchstone for an entire movement of Floridians and other Americans who continue  to  fight to save our natural places, not only for  future generations, but also for their own sake.  Unfortunately,  the Everglades  still  faces  threats of the attrition of development, and the  redirection of  its waters.  In  the Water Resources Development Plan of 2000, Congress  included a comprehensive restoration plan to  bring the Everglades back to its natural state.  The Everglades  remain one of  the Nation’s  greatest natural treasures, and I am proud to  stand in recognition today of their 60th anniversary as part of the park system.  ",2008

203,23,2008-03-04,Mr. BUYER.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank some of my colleagues for their  vision back in 2003. They recognized  that Congress does a good job talking  about Medicare and the concerns about  the future, but they realize that very  few are very committed to addressing  Medicare’s challenges.  We, as a Congress, came together and  worked with President Clinton in the  1990s when we did the Balanced Budget  Act; and at that time, we even realized  that Medicare was growing, the growing senior population was going to be a  tremendous challenge to us; and in 2003  a small group of Members of Congress,  they put in trigger legislation, and now  this trigger, as the chairman said, goes  into effect  if the Medicare board of  trustees certifies  in two consecutive  years  that  45  percent  of Medicare  spending will come from general revenues in any of the upcoming 6 years.  Last year, the trustees certified this  Medicare spending level; and again this  year,  they have  certified  that  the  spending  is exorbitant and that the  trigger has now been hit.  As directed by law, the President had  no choice. He sent legislation to Congress to address this spending. We in  Congress have a responsibility to the  American people to act on the President’s  proposal. Unfortunately,  last  year my Democrat colleagues tried to  remove this trigger so that they can  continue  to  put  off  addressing  the  unsustainable cost of our Medicare program. Under their CHAMP legislation,  they slipped in a provision that would  have removed this trigger. In effect, it  would have allowed Congress to continue  to  ignore Medicare’s  growing  cost.  Even worse, the Democrats decided  to ignore Medicare’s growing costs; and  when  they do  that,  frankly  it  just  shoves these challenges off into the future and onto the backs of our children, and that is something we should  not be doing.  Last week, the majority leader and  the minority leader introduced a bill to  move forward with the President’s proposal  to bring Medicare costs back  under the trigger level. That is the responsible thing to do.  This Congress now should act on this  legislation. According to the Centers  for Medicare  and Medicaid Service  Health  Care  Spending,  the United  States will hit $4.3 trillion by year 2017,  nearly double that of 2007, equating to  nearly 20 percent of our gross domestic  product. In 2007, health care spending  accounted for 16.3 percent of our gross  domestic product. But more of that  cost is expected to shift to government  agencies even as the Federal Government struggles to shrink our own deficits.  Medicare spending alone is expected  to grow to $844 billion in year 2017.  That’s up from the $427 billion we spent  just last year in 2007. So Congress must  stop talking about Medicare and its potential insolvency, and we must take  action.  Medicare is the single largest purchaser of health care  in the United  States; and within the next 11 years,  the Medicare trust fund could potentially go bankrupt. Our Nation is at  risk to lose this important health care  program for seniors if we do not reform  this program. Future generations will  not have access, and that would be unfortunate.  This trigger has forced Congress to  be honest with the American people  about Medicare’s dim future. The future of our Medicare program, as I said,  is at risk. I ask my colleagues to join  with me to change this trend and protect Medicare for future generations,  and we can only do that by working together.  ",2008
204,23,2008-03-04,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to recapitulate why we are here  this evening taking this Special Order.  As I pointed out earlier, Medicare is a  mandatory program for senior citizens  over age 65. It was established in 1965,  which is 43 years ago. I don’t exactly  remember in the first year how many  citizens were covered and how much  money was expended, but my recollection is that several million senior citizens were covered and expenses were in  the order of a magnitude of 6 or $700  million. In the last year that we have  numbers for, 45 million Americans were  covered and the costs were over 400 billion.  Now, it is a good thing that we have  45 million senior citizens in this country. Those are our grandparents and  great grandparents and great aunts and  uncles. They are certainly the generation that has been pointed out that  fought the great wars of World War II  and Korea and Vietnam. They have  ushered in an amazing American economy unsurpassed in the history of the  world in terms of its ability to generate wealth and economic prosperity.  And they are well deserving of the benefits that we are paying out for Medicare.  So the problem is not that our senior  citizens don’t deserve the best health  care in the world, and it is not that we  are  living healthier and  longer. The  problem is, quite simply, how do we  pay  for  it. Average expenditures  for  Medicare are on the order of magnitude  of about $7,000 per person per year. And  to put that in perspective, that is more  than most families pay per person for  their food or for their housing.  If nothing  is done on the current  Medicare program in terms of its policies and the way it’s structured in 11  years, in 2019, the Medicare trust fund  is going to be bankrupt. As I pointed  out earlier, if you are 54 years young or  younger, when you retire, there will be  no Medicare. Now I’m 58. So if I were to  retire at age 65, in 7 years I would have  3 years of Medicare benefits before the  program went  bankrupt. My wife,  Terry, who’s younger than me, when  she retires, she would have no benefits.  None of my children would have benefits. None of my grandchildren would  have benefits.  So this is not a program that we can  just let go on automatic pilot. We need  to begin to fundamentally and in a focused way look at the Medicare program as it exists today, not cut people  off the program, not change it so that  there are fewer benefits. We need to  look at Medicare and try to bring our  technology to bear, bring our management processes to bear, all of the innovations that have happened in the last  40 years.  As I pointed out earlier, if we were  still making the 1964 Mustang, that  was a great car in 1964, 1965. But it’s  hardly the car that people want to buy  today. We didn’t have cell phones in  1965. Today, everybody in America has  a cell phone. In fact, there are more  cell phones than there are hard line  phones. If you look at computers, the  computer in 1965 was a mainframe computer that you had to go to a central  location to use. I would guess that almost every American citizen has some  access to a personal computer today.  So a lot has changed in many fields  since 1965. But in Medicare, we have  the  same basic program  funded  the  same basic way.  b2000  So we need to look at ways to change  that program and to bring it into the  21st century. I think some of those  ideas are going to be in the form of preventive medicine, like we have in those  seniors, about 20 percent of those 9 million that have chosen a Medicare Advantage plan. There may be some ways  in terms of sharing costs; as the President has  suggested, Medicare beneficiaries that are more well-to-do could  pay a higher share of their premium.  We have the whole issue of health information  technology, or health  IT.  It’s suspected and predicted that if we  would bring health information technology to bear on Medicare, you could  save tens of billions, perhaps more,  each year  just by using  that  technology that’s currently in the private  sector.  So, there are a number of great ideas,  but because of this Medicare trigger,  this year, a certain percent of Members, I believe it is 70 Members, but a  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:09 Mar 05, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K04MR7.055 H04MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2008
205,37,2008-03-04,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, I  wish to take a  few moments of my  leader time, not to  interfere  in the  record with this discussion that has  been ongoing between  the Senators  from Kansas and Washington.  Last  week  we  debated  housing.  Democrats want  to  raise monthly  mortgage payments on everyone who  wants to buy a new home or refinance  an existing one. Republicans have a  broader, bolder plan. We want to create  the economic conditions  that make  home ownership easier—more jobs and  higher wages. Our first priority is to  help  families who are either  facing  foreclosure or seeing the values of their  homes drop as a result of other foreclosures nearby.  This morning I want to talk about  one specific action we can take to help  these families. Home values are falling  not only because of cut-rate sell-offs by  banks but also because areas with high  volume and vacant homes often see an  increase  in crime and neglect. One  thing government has done in the past  to the help reverse a slide in home values is to make tax credits available to  people who pick up foreclosed homes in  affected areas. This worked in the mid-  1970s when a period of easing credit led  to overconstruction and higher interest  rates. Congress responded with a $6,000  tax credit spread over 3 years for anyone who bought a new home for their  primary residence. This is what they  did back in the 1970s. Home values were  stabilized. Inventory dropped, and the  housing market recovered.  Congress should do the same today.  Senator JOHNNY ISAKSONof Georgia, a  real expert in real estate and housing,  who spent decades in that field, has a  fabulous idea. He saw the good effects  of the tax credit that Congress provided back in the 1970s. Now he is proposing a $15,000 credit spread over 3  years for people who buy newer homes  with a first mortgage in default or single-family homes in the possession of a  bank. Let me say that again. He is proposing a $15,000 tax credit spread over 3  years for people who buy newer homes  with a first mortgage in default or single family homes in the possession of a  bank. Buyers must occupy those homes  as their principal residence to be eligible. We are not about to let speculators  come in and make the current problem  even worse.  This is one idea Republicans are proposing to help families struggling with  the painful effects of the housing downturn. I mentioned some of these ideas  yesterday. We will discuss others as  the week goes on.

206,44,2008-03-04,Ms. KLOBUCHAR.," Mr. President, I  am proud to be a member of the Commerce Committee that passed this legislation through the committee under  the  leadership of Chairman  Senator STEVENS, and the Consumer  Subcommittee Chairman PRYOR. I am  also glad this legislation includes the  bill  I  introduced that  finally put a  mandatory ban on lead in children’s  toys.  This legislation has been called by  the Wall Street Journal as ‘‘the most  significant consumer-safety legislation  in a generation.’’ That comes from the  Wall Street Journal. But what this is  about is not all the details of all the  toys, which I am going to talk about in  a minute, and the 29 million toys that  have been recalled and what this has  meant to our economy, but what this is  about are these little children.  Senator PRYOR and  I  just  left an  event where two children, their families, their mothers, were there to talk  about what had happened to them. The  first was this little boy named Jacob.  His family is from Arkansas. The mom  painted this picture for us. Look at  this little boy. She painted this picture  that I will never forget, of her standing  in the kitchen one day and all of a sudden they see their little boy and he is  practically  limp. Just  like  that he  went  from being a happy  little boy  playing.  What happened is he had swallowed  one of these Aqua Dots toys, one of  these toys you put in water and it expands to an animal or whatever it is.  He had swallowed it. So he is getting  more and more limp, and finally the  ambulance comes and they end up in  the hospital. Within an hour, he  is  completely unconscious. They have no  idea what is wrong. Unconscious. They  thought maybe he had swallowed a little  toy, maybe  something  that you  would think would be in his stomach  creating  some  indigestion or  something such as that, but the hospital  tries everything  they can  think of.  They thought maybe he had accidentally gotten into their medicine cabinet and they didn’t know it and took  some medicine  and  something happened. So they gave him drugs to try  to reverse it, but he wouldn’t wake up.  It was a complete puzzle because they  didn’t know how this could have happened. Nothing they tried worked.  Finally, 6 hours later—and the doctor  said  if  he  hadn’t  been  there,  he  wouldn’t have  believed  it—with  all  these  tubes connected and everyone  thinking they are going to lose him, he  wakes up and he  is  fine. And they  think: How could this happen? What is  wrong? And they simply don’t know.  So they call the company that manufactures these Aqua Dots and they try  to write them. The mom gets home the  next day and gets on the Internet with  bloggers  trying  to  figure out what  could be wrong. She writes letters to  the company, trying to get information.  Well, finally, they tested him some  more and they tested these Aqua Dots  some more. And what did they find?  They found that the Aqua Dots contained a chemical that was really the  date rape drug.  The date rape drug, as a prosecutor, I  can tell you that we handled those  cases where women have been slipped  one of those drugs in their drink; they  are suddenly completely out of it and  do not know what happens. You know  the crimes that have occurred as a result there.  But here is this little boy swallowing  a dot, a dot that had the date rape drug  in it manufactured in China. And that  mother stood here with Senator PRYOR  and me and told this moving story and  said: This cannot happen to other parents.  She said: The Senators in this body,  why do they not think if this happened  to their kid or their grandkid where  they suddenly swallow a little toy and  are out like that. It is like swallowing  a gumball, out like that for 6 hours  thinking they are going to die.  Then there was another mother who  came from Oregon. She told the story  of her son, whom we see now years  later, Colton. When he was very little,  he swallowed a charm they had gotten  from some one of those little vending  machines that you put your money  into.  He swallowed it. And all of a sudden  she said he started acting completely  lethargic, not at all like the little toddler he was. And they brought him into  the hospital and they found out that  charm was 39 percent lead, 39 percent  lead.  Now, their story, unlike the story of  little Jacob, did not end there, because  he has that lead permanently in his  system. And today, years and years  later when they go to the doctor, he is  still tested  for elevated  lead  levels.  And, in fact, even a few days after he  got home, after they had gotten the  charm out of his stomach, he bit his  cheek and his cheek swelled up to the  size of a golf ball because of the lead  that was in his system.  That is what we are talking about—  moms getting little charms that their  kids swallow, which used to be maybe  if you swallowed a penny, having this  kind of health effect.  We all know what lead can mean. I  certainly know in Minnesota where we  had a little boy whose mom was not  with us today. The mom was not there  because her heart is broken. Her little  4-year-old boy died when he swallowed  a charm that turned out to be 99 percent  lead. And he did not die  from  choking, he did not die because  it  blocked his airway, he died because  that lead seeped into his system day  after day. And when he died, he was  tested at three times the normal lead  level.  In 2007, nearly 29 million toys and  pieces of children’s  jewelry were recalled because they were found to be  dangerous and, in some cases, deadly  for children. As a mom and a former  prosecutor and now as a Senator, I find  it totally unacceptable that these toxic  toys are  in our  stores and on our  shores. As my 12-year-old daughter said  when she found out that the Barbies  were being recalled, she said: This is  getting serious.  The provision of the Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act  that I authored addresses some of the  most serious discoveries of this past  year. And that is the lead that has been  surfacing in these toys. The toy that  little Jarnell Brown swallowed that led  to his death was made in China. It was  99 percent lead.  The toy that little Colton swallowed  that nearly led to his death and has led  to elevated lead levels in his bloodstream for many years was 39 percent  lead.  These  deaths,  these  injuries have  been made so much more tragic by the  fact that they could have been prevented. These little boys should never  have been given these toys in the first  place.  It  should not  take a child’s  death or severe injury or a child swallowing an Aqua Dot with a date rape  drug to alert us that there is a problem  in this country.  Parents should have the right to expect that these toys are tested and that  these problems are found before these  toys get to the toy box. For 30 years,  we have been aware of the dangers  poised by lead. We all know about it  from the lead paint standard.  But what is ironic to me is we have a  Federal standard  for  lead paint, we  have a standard, but we have never had  a standard for lead in toys or jewelry;  never had a standard for those little  pieces of jewelry that will end up in  kids’ stomachs, or how about teenage  girls who are sitting in class and chewing on a charm that they may have  around their neck—never had a standard; it has all been voluntary.

210,51,2008-03-04,Mr. BARRASSO.," Mr. President, years  from now, young people in Wyoming  will talk about the many events that  have helped shape their lives—people  such as their parents, their friends, and  their teachers, places such as the Tetons, Devil’s Tower, and the Wyoming  Range, and some will say that Craig  and Susan Thomas helped change their  lives. They will say there was a foundation. Almost out of the blue they will  say that it gave them a scholarship,  that it encouraged them to succeed,  and  that  it helped  them back  into  school. And one of those individuals  will be able to say: I now have a great  job, I have a family, and I get to keep  living in Wyoming. These young people  will say: If it wasn’t for the Craig and  Susan Thomas Foundation,  I  don’t  know where I would be today.  We know  the Craig Thomas who  fought every day for the people of Wyoming, advocating before each of you  with a Western common sense that is  legendary, but on the weekends and on  his time in Wyoming, for nearly two  decades, the one thing our friend Craig  Thomas dedicated himself tirelessly to  was  the young people of Wyoming.  Every kid—top of the class, middle of  the class or simply in the class—Craig  Thomas would want  to meet with  them, would want to talk with them,  want  to  laugh with  them. He even  played Hacky Sack with them in his  cowboy boots. He would find out how  they were doing, what they were thinking, what they were going to do with  their lives. He would tell them to find  out what it was they liked to do the  best and then do it.  Craig believed everyone should be a  good citizen, learn as much as possible,  and then have a chance to be happy.  But for economic reasons, for family  challenges or just a raw deal, we know  some of these kids face tall hurdles.  Some kids have a harder time, and  Craig was always there to help.  Many of my colleagues know Craig  also had a wonderful partner  in his  mission  for Wyoming  kids,  Susan  Thomas. A lifelong teacher herself in  developmental  education,  she  joined  him proudly in reaching out to Wyoming’s youth. Together they did an  amazing job. I saw them do it. I know  many of my colleagues also saw  it  when Craig would bring members of  Susan’s classes  through  the Capitol  each year. They would come to watch,  to learn, and to be invited in.  Craig and Susan inspired kids across  Wyoming and kids right in this area  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:58 Mar 05, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G04MR6.028 S04MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 1 6 C P D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2008

230,65,2008-03-04,Mr. BROWN.," Mr. President, last Sunday marked the 1-year anniversary of a  tragic bus crash outside Atlanta, GA,  which was transporting members of the  Bluffton University baseball team from  my State of Ohio to play baseball in  Florida. The crash took the lives of  Tyler Williams and Cody Holp, Scott  Harmon, Zack Arend, and David Joseph  Betts. The driver, Jerome Niemeyer,  and his wife Jean were also killed in  the crash. Most of the other 33 passengers were treated for injuries.  While  the  investigation  into  the  cause of the crash is ongoing, one thing  is clear: Stronger safety regulations  could have minimized  the  fatalities  and injuries resulting from the crash.  John Betts, who lost his son in this  accident,  sees upgrading  the  safety  laws for motor coaches as an opportunity to save the lives of future riders. One year ago, Mr. Betts made a  promise to his late son. He promised to  dedicate himself to motor coach safety.  Thus, through this tragedy, a movement  began  to  adopt  commonsense  safety regulations that lower the risk  of injury or fatality in accidents. Mr.  Betts launched a Web site to educate  the public about motor coach safety.  He agrees to do regular interviews so  he can use his own heartbreaking experience to gain momentum for his cause.  Mr. Betts visits his son’s grave twice  a day. Of his visit the other day, he  said:  I just asked him to give me strength, give  me wisdom, give me the words to keep fighting to make sure something good comes from  something so bad.  KAY BAILEY  Last  fall,  Senator  HUTCHISONof Texas and I joined this  effort,  introducing  the Motor Coach  Enhanced Safety Act. This bill, which  has the support of Mr. Betts and countless safety advocates, would codify recommendations  from  the  National  Transportation Safety Board. It surprised me—and it will surprise my colleagues—that the safety improvements  in this bill are not already standard  HUTCHISON safety  practice. They  include  such  basic and logical safety measures as  the use of seatbelts and  fire extinguishers. These  are not new  technologies. These  are  safety  features  widely used  in other  transportation  equipment. They  are  commonsense.  They  save  lives. They  should be a  given, not some distant goal.  Many of the  injuries sustained  in  motor coaches could be prevented by  incorporating high-quality safety technologies that exist today but, unfortunately, are not widely used, such as  crush-proof roofing and glazed windows  to prevent ejection.  Unfortunately, the Bluffton University baseball team’s bus crash was not  an  isolated  incident.  Senator  quickly  pointed  to  the  many accidents in Texas while this bill  was being drafted, such as the crash involving  the Westbrook High School  girl’s soccer team in 2006.  As a father of four and recently a  grandfather,  it upsets me  to know  motor coaches are such unregulated vehicles that our kids don’t have the option to buckle up. The tragedy of these  and other motor coach accidents has  created motivation and hope  in Mr.  Betts and others for increased safety in  this industry in the future. It is our job  to take that motivation and that hope  and turn them into action.  I urge my colleagues to consider the  Motor Coach Enhancement Safety Act.  Passage of this bill would undoubtedly  mean saved lives in the future. It is my  hope  in the  future parents will not  have to endure the anguish and the  rest-of-his-life grief that John Betts  and other families’ members have experienced.  For those who suffered from the tragedy in Atlanta of the Bluffton baseball  team on March  2,  2007,  I offer my  thoughts and prayers.  ",2008

233,65,2008-03-04,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President, I was  pleased to learn last week that the Air  Force had made a selection for the development and procurement of its new  aerial refueling tanker fleet. I am told  that the replacement of the 1950s-era  fleet  of KC–135s had  been  the Air  Force’s No. 1 procurement priority. By  the time the last one is replaced, it will  be over 80 years old.

234,72,2008-03-04,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce a bill that I call the  Farm Red Tape Reduction Act.  This act will give farmers a voice in  Federal rulemakings whenever a new  Federal regulation threatens to impose  severe economic pain on farmers.  As we  saw with  small businesses,  many times the Government overlooks  the plight of the little guy, who does  not have the resources or know-how to  weigh-in with big Government agencies  in Washington. In 1976, Congress created the Office of Advocacy to ensure  that small businesses have an advocate  in Government and a seat at the table  when new regulations affecting them  are drafted. I want to share that same  success now with farmers.  The idea is simple. This act would  help provide a more transparent Government  that  listens  to  the people  most affected by the regulations. It  will hold  the Government more accountable for its actions. It is a message that the Federal Government is  meant to serve to its citizens, not bully  them. We want to make this an easy  process. Citizens should be heard while  the Government is deciding on a regulation that affects them—not after the  decision is made. The difference is subtle, but important. Listen to farmers  and agriculture first—be inclusive.  Cutting unnecessary  red  tape will  provide  greater  flexibility  for  agriculture businesses by removing barriers to enterprise. Encouraging enterprise is essential if the United States is  to compete in a global environment.  Farms and other agricultural businesses will  benefit  from  simplified  rules.  This measure will help in cutting red  tape with a view to improving the environment for agricultural business. My  experience on the Small Business Committee tells me that there are currently dozens of regulatory proposals  before  Federal  agencies—but most  without a true assessment of impact on  the very people they will most affect.  The question we must ask ourselves  is this: Are all these initiatives necessary and what are the consequences?  I want agencies to look into this question. The best way to do that is to hear  from the folks most affected.  The Office of Advocacy celebrated its  30th anniversary this year. The Regulatory Flexibility Act, RFA, is 27 years  old and the Small Business Regulatory  Enforcement Fairness Act, SBREFA, is  11 years old.  The common theme: They have all  gone a long way in making agencies  aware of the unique concerns of small  business. With the passage of these  laws  small  business  concerns were  given a voice at the table, they have  been putting that voice to use ever  since—with great success.  These  laws  have  been  successful.  Early intervention and improved compliance have  led to  less burdensome  regulations. For example, in fiscal year  2001,  involvement  in  agency  rulemakings helped save small businesses an estimated $4.4 billion in new  regulatory compliance costs.  Similarly, in fiscal year 2002, efforts  to improve agency compliance with the  RFA on behalf of small entities secured  more than $21 billion in first-year cost  savings, with an additional $10 billion  in  annually  recurring  cost  savings.  Most recently, in fiscal year 2003, they  achieved more than $6.3 billion in regulatory cost savings and more than $5.7  billion in recurring annual savings on  behalf of small entities.  If we can add farmers to the table  and save them any portion of that kind  of money—just that fact will make this  bill a success.  Just as important is that these laws  have not hindered the development of  regulations.  In  fact,  these  laws are  credited with helping regulators come  up with better plans. Plans that work—  because the people who will be regulated are involved in the development  of the rules. This gives them some ownership and that makes successful compliance and implementation.  Our economy and the lives of farmers  is constantly changing—this is due in  no small part to what we are doing  today—making changes to farm legislation, new  technologies, new  trade  deals, new regulations of every kind  being  implemented year round. This  creates new and constant challenges  for analyzing regulatory  impacts on  farmers. If there was ever a time farmers needed a voice at the table when  new regulations are made—it is now.  It is not my intention to throw out  regulations simply as a matter of principle if, for example, they involve costs  for businesses. I am more concerned  with obtaining solid impact analyses  that can serve as a basis for informed  decision-making.  It is also quite clear that better regulations will be possible only if those affected also play their part, since it is  they who will be responsible for implementation.  What I have heard from some who oppose this, is that they are concerned  about the burden of red tape. However,  they are not concerned about the burden of red tape on farmers. They are  concerned about the burden of red tape  on Washington regulators working to  impose red tape on farmers.  Surely the Senate should be more  concerned with red tape on our farmers  than red tape on our Washington regulators. We should have a rulemaking  advocate for farmers just as we have  one at Small Business Administration  for small businesses. Advocates do not  have the power to change standards or  stop regulations, only inform them. We  should all support a more  informed  process so burdens are reduced and regulations are more effective and widely  supported. We all know what having a  USDA rulemaking advocate means in  Washington; there will still be 20 officials from other agencies in the room  working to regulate farmers. But now,  there may be one from USDA also in  the room.  This bill has received support from  the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Council of Farmer  Cooperatives,  the  National  Cotton  Council, the American Soybean Association, National Milk Producers Federation, South East Dairy Farmers Association,  National  Association  of  Wheat Growers, USA Rice Federation,  Western United Dairymen, and the National Pork Producers Council.  I ask my colleagues to support this  bill and join me in helping farmers and  agricultural business reduce unnecessary bureaucratic red tape by including  them at the table.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 2691  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

262,100,2008-03-04,Mr. SCHIFF.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor Cynthia J. Kurtz, who recently retired  from her post as City Manager of Pasadena,  California. Ms. Kurtz served the City for over  20 years, spending the last 10 years as the  chief administrative officer of Pasadena’s diverse community of 144,000  residents and  has left a legacy that will be enjoyed by generations to come.  In her capacity as city manager, Cynthia  was  responsible  for over 2,300 employees  with an operating budget of over $550 million.  With a keen vision for the ‘‘big picture’’ and a  wealth of experience to draw upon, she was  the driving force behind some of the most important projects in the city’s history.  Cynthia came to Pasadena after 10 years of  employment with the city of Portland, Oregon,  where she held a variety of positions in the  Office of Transportation and  the Bureau of  Economic  Development.  That  experience  served Pasadena well when she was hired as  the City’s Capital Program Administrator  in  1987. In 1991, she became director of public  works  for  the City of Pasadena where she  shepherded high profile projects such as the  delicate $24 million reconstruction of the historic Colorado Street Bridge.  During my years in the California State Senate, I worked with Cynthia on the planning for  a light rail line from Los Angeles to Pasadena,  and her contributions to that project were vital  to its success. Completed on time and under  budget,  the Gold Line  light  rail project has  been an invaluable asset to the San Gabriel  Valley, and especially to Pasadena.  The Pasadena City Council was well aware  of Cynthia’s hard work on  their behalf, and  when  the position of city manager became  open in 1998, she was the first woman to be  appointed to that post. As city manager, she  first concentrated on solidifying budget procedures while also attending to the quality of life  issues that make Pasadena a special place to  live and work.  Ms. Kurtz’s most recent landmark achievement was last year’s completion of a $118 million renovation of historic Pasadena City Hall.  When  the structure was determined  to be  seismically vulnerable, she worked with her  staff  to create a plan  that would safeguard  Pasadena employees while also preserving  this most  recognizable  jewel of  the  ‘‘Crown  City.’’ The project was completed ahead of  schedule and continues to stand as a testament to Pasadena’s rich architectural heritage.  Cynthia Kurtz has been an invaluable asset  to the city of Pasadena, and I ask all Members  to join me in thanking Cynthia J. Kurtz for over  2 decades of dedicated service.  f  HONORING THE EASTERN MONTGOMERY COUNTY CHAMBER OF  COMMERCE  HON. ALLYSON Y.

263,100,2008-03-04,Ms. SCHWARTZ.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor and congratulate the Eastern  Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce  on achieving an important milestone, its 75th  anniversary. Since 1933,  the Eastern Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce has  tirelessly promoted its members and the economic health of our community. I am honored  to represent this organization in Congress.  In 1933, the Jenkintown Businessmen’s Association was incorporated with just 44 members. Since  that  time,  the  chamber  has  changed its name a number of times to mark  its growth within the business community. In  1961, the organization became the Jenkintown  Chamber of Commerce. By 1968, the organization  became  known  as  the  Greater  Jenkintown Chamber of Commerce to reflect  the expansion of its service area. In 1992, the  chamber became  the Eastern Montgomery  County Chamber of Commerce.  While successfully  fulfilling  its mission  to  support and promote  local businesses of all  sizes, the chamber has also successfully established strong community ties. The chamber  has partnered with area businesses  to host  the annual Best of  the Burbs celebration of  business cultural and community events, featuring  the chamber’s annual Business Expo,  which showcases over 100 area businesses.  In 2003, the chamber established Leadership  Montgomery County, an  innovative program  dedicated  to strengthening  the personal and  professional skills of our community’s  future  leaders.  The chamber’s active board of directors and  committed staff implement outreach, advocacy  and  fundraising activities  to strengthen  the  chamber’s enduring presence in the community. Over  the past 75 years,  the Eastern  Montgomery  Chamber  of  Commerce  has  served as a powerful catalyst, uniting businesses, community agencies, government officials, and educational institutions to make our  community a great place to live and work.  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues  join me in celebrating the Eastern Montgomery  County Chamber of Commerce’s 75th anniversary milestone and wishing the chamber and  its members many more years of community  enrichment and service.  f  TRIBUTE TO MONSIGNOR WILLIAM  J.

For  the past 31 years he has  been the pastor of St. Rose of Lima parish, a  multi-ethnic and multi-racial congregation with  representation  from 42 nations around  the  world.  The New Community Corporation celebrates  its 40th anniversary  this year.  Its history  is  filled with stories of service to the city of Newark. The New Community Corporation is the  most comprehensive and  largest community  development organization in the United States,  employing over 1600 individuals and providing  urban dwellers with housing, day care, alternative education, social services, job training,  employment services and health care.  Monsignor Linder has received many honors  and awards including the HUD Distinguished  Service Award, The National Association of  Home Builders Housing Hall of Fame award,  the Aetna Foundation Voice of Conscience  Award,  the MacArthur Foundation Fellows  Award and the Governor’s Gold Medal (NJ).  He was also selected by President Clinton to  attend the president’s first inauguration as one  of the 60 ‘‘Faces of Hope’’ and by President  Bush to participate in a conference on faith-  based initiatives.  Madam Speaker, I know my colleagues will  join me in honoring a wonderful servant to humanity. I am pleased to recognize his tremendous contributions to the city of Newark and  wish him the best in all his future endeavors.  f  IN TRIBUTE TO LOUVENIA  JOHNSON  HON.

I served on the Ethics Committee for 4 years, had some of the  same circumstances that Mr. HULSHOF  was previously talking about at the  time. Mr. HASTINGS and Mrs. TUBBS  JONESwere also members of the Ethics  Committee.  And there’s a reason that we take  that oath of secrecy, and it’s why, unlike Mr. HULSHOF, I voted  ‘‘no’’ last  night. My belief has always been that  the ethics process here has worked  when left to its own devices, and by  ‘‘left to its own devices,’’ when leadership on either side stays out of it and  permits five good Democrats and five  good Republicans to consider what is  sometimes a messy business. But  it  needs to be not aired  in public as,  sadly, this new whatever we did last  night will do, because, and I used to be  a  prosecuting  attorney,  as  did  the  chairwoman of the committee, there  are many times when a case is brought  to you and there are no facts to support that case, but you will be accused  on page 1 and the case will be dismissed  on page 45, and when you’re in public  life, by the time you get to the retraction on page 45, your career is ruined.  So every Member that embarks upon  the ethics process takes the oath that  we will hold close to us and not discuss  with our colleagues, not discuss with  the press, not discuss with others if we  have a Member under investigation, if  allegations are made against a Member, not to protect a Member, not to  shield that Member from scrutiny, but  so that we don’t shoot the Member  until there has been an adjudication  that he or she has done something  wrong. I took that oath. Every member  of the committee takes that oath. We  take that seriously.  Now, yesterday evening when I was  preparing to make a determination as  to how to vote, I received a memo from  Representative  HASTINGS, that had included in it the  opinion of the nonpartisan, bipartisan  HASTINGS,  professional staff of the Ethics Committee where they opined on how, if at  all, what was being done  last night  would impact upon the ethics process  of this House. I have to tell you that  the memorandum wasn’t written  for  Republicans.  It wasn’t written  for  Democrats. It was nonpartisan, bipartisan, and I found a lot in it that I  thought that’s an interesting point and  I hadn’t actually thought about it. I  was grateful to receive that memorandum from DOCHASTINGS, not knowing how it came to my possession or attention other than DOCHASTINGSprovided it.  I’m dismayed on this point of personal privilege, however, to then be in  receipt of a letter written by my friend  the chairwoman of the committee that,  in my opinion, has a tortured construction of rule 7 of the committee. It correctly indicates that we take the oath  of secrecy and matters should only be  discussed in accordance with the rules  of the House. Mr. HULSHOF, I think, has  adequately talked about 7(d), and what  that indicates is that we’re not supposed to talk about if Representative Y  is under investigation until that matter moves to the public phase, that  being the adjudicatory hearing, which  we achieved against  the gentleman  from Ohio a number of years ago and  which we were all involved in.  b1215  It does not, in my opinion, indicate  that when a memorandum that might  be instructive to the other Members of  the House on a matter before the House  should remain secret. And I would just  say that we would then read paragraph  7(g) that indicates that, ‘‘Unless otherwise determined by a vote of the committee, only the chairman or ranking  minority member of the committee,  after  consultation with  each other,  may make public statements regarding  matters before the committee of any  subcommittee.’’  The gentleman from Washington says  that is what he did. And if the gentleman  from Washington did that, I  find no violation of  the committee  rules. I find no violation of the House  rules. And I think what is most unfortunate, and it really goes into why the  matters before the Ethics Committee  need to remain secret, the letter suggests, it doesn’t suggest, it says that  Representative HASTINGS has broken  the rules of the House, and if he does it  again, there is going to be a complaint.  Well, if someone feels that way, then  file a complaint. But it is entitled to  the confidentiality which it is now indicated has somehow been broken.  And I want to indicate that besides  my  disappointment,  that  what  is  roiling this House, and I think those of  us that are centrists, moderates, those  of us that are institutionalists, we now  are roiled  in the House because the  rules don’t seem to be the rules. The  rules apply when people think they  should apply. And if the rules don’t  apply, well, then we will make a new  rule.  And last night’s example, and it ties  in directly to this point of personal  privilege, couldn’t be any clearer. The  new majority, because of the Medicare  part  D  vote  that  Representative  HULSHOFtalked about that we wrongly  held open for 3 hours to achieve a certain result, in outrage in response to  the culture of corruption  that permeated this place until 2007, led to a  rule change. And the rule change was  that we will hold no vote open in this  House for the sole purpose of affecting  the outcome or changing the outcome.  Well, that is just what we did last  night, sadly, Mr. Speaker. For 12 minutes, 12 minutes after the final vote  was cast, the vote was held open. It was  204–209. And during those 12 minutes,  four Members of the majority party  were persuaded to switch their votes.  There  is no other explanation. But  where we find ourselves, and why this  point of personal privilege is so important, where we find ourselves is that  the rule is written in such a way that  says you can’t hold the vote open for  the sole purpose of affecting or changing the outcome.  Now, we are going to have to bring in  Kreskin. We are going to have to have  ESP to climb into the mind of the presiding officer. And unless the presiding  officer says, do you know what, I know  what the rule is, I know what clause 9  of rule XX says, but I kept the vote  open to affect the outcome. Short of  that, there is no way to enforce the  rule. And it puts us in a very difficult  place. And I would ask my friends that  are today in the majority to remember  the 12 years that they were in the minority that they felt so oppressed, and  in many cases had the right to feel oppressed, by some of the heavy-handed  tactics that were employed on the conduct of this floor.  When you have a rule that can never  be enforced, when you have rules that  you don’t pay attention to, it leads to  discontent. It destroys the fabric of the  institution. The minority serves an important purpose in the House of Representatives. It is the loyal dissent. It  is to make sure that the majority just  can’t run roughshod and do what they  choose to do in violation of rules, practices, precedents and procedures.  I fear, Mr. Speaker, that last night  the rules were once again broken. I believe  that  the  totality of  the  circumstances will demonstrate that. But  what I do not find is that my friend and  classmate  from  the State of Washington violated rule 7 of the Ethics  Committee.  ",2008

278,15,2008-03-12,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I will insert into the RECORD letters  from The Hamilton Project and the  Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,  which state clearly and unequivocally  that the Democratic budget resolution  does not raise taxes.  THEHAMILTONPROJECT,  Washington, DC, March 7, 2008.  Congressman JOHNSPRATT,  Longworth Bldg.,  Washington, DC.  DEARCONGRESSMANSPRATT: Per your request, I have analyzed the House Budget  Committee’s budget resolution. The budget  would not raise taxes. The revenue levels in  the budget are, in net total, the same as the  baseline revenue levels projected by the Congressional Budget Office. These revenue levels are consistent with continuing current  law, not with changes to the law that would  raise or lower taxes.  The purpose of a budget baseline is to establish a neutral starting point to debate  and evaluate alternative priorities for spending, taxes, and the debt. The budget resolution adopts the baseline recommended by  several respected, non-partisan groups  including  the Concord Coalition,  the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the  Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and  the Committee for Economic Development.  But the choice of a baseline does not commit policymakers  to any  specific  tax or  spending policy. Instead a baseline, in conjunction with the restoration of the pay-as-  you-go rules, would provide a framework for  making  tradeoffs between different priorities. Indeed, your budget indicates that one  of your priorities is making up-front cuts in  taxes  for alternative minimum tax relief  that would ultimately be paid for without increasing the budget deficit.  The founding strategy paper of The Hamilton Project states that one of the greatest  economic risks our nation faces today is our  country’s large fiscal imbalance. The papers  notes that ‘‘the decisions necessary to restore fiscal balance might be easier to enact  and to enforce  if policymakers reinstated  credible budget rules governing both spending and taxes.’’ The pay-as-you-go proposal  in the budget resolution will hopefully help  policymakers make the tough choices required to put America on a path to a balanced budget.  I hope this analysis is helpful and please do  not hesitate if you have any follow-up questions.  Thank you,  JASONFURMAN.  CENTERONBUDGETAND  POLICYPRIORITIES,  Washington, DC, March 7, 2008.  CLAIMTHATCONGRESSIONALBUDGETPLANS  CALLFOR ‘‘LARGESTTAX INCREASE INHISTORY’’ ISINACCURATE  Some are claiming that the budget plans  adopted this week by the House and Senate  Budget Committees—the full House and Senate are scheduled to consider their respective committee’s plan next week—would constitute ‘‘the largest tax increase in history.’’  This claim is inaccurate, just as the same  claim was  inaccurate with regard to the  budget resolution the Congress adopted last  year. Neither of the plans recommended this  week by the budget committees include a tax  increase. The House plan simply assumes the  same level of revenues over the 2008–2013 period as projected by the Congressional Budget Office under its current policy baseline,  which essentially assumes no change in current laws governing taxes. The Senate plan  actually calls for a small reduction in revenues, reflecting its assumption that Alternative Minimum Tax relief will be extended  for one year without any offset of the revenues that will be lost as a result of that extension and that a second stimulus bill this  year may include a small tax cut.  The charge that the budget plans proposed  by the House and Senate Budget Committees  include a large tax increase arises not from  any policy changes proposed in those plans,  but instead from policies enacted in 2001 and  2003. Legislation enacted in those years put  in place tax cuts proposed by President Bush  but provided for those tax cuts to expire at  the  end  of  2010,  unless  current  law  is  changed. Both the House and Senate Budget  Committee plans assume that current law  will be amended to extend some of the expiring tax cuts (especially those affecting middle-class families) and make other changes  in tax policy, but they assume (except in the  case of temporary AMT relief and stimulus  legislation in the Senate plan) that the cost  of  such changes will he offset by other  changes in policy. They do not assume that  total revenues will be increased above what  is expected to be collected under current  policies.  It should be recalled that the President’s  tax cuts expire in 2010 because their supporters deliberately designed them that way,  in order to fit the tax cuts within the cost  constraints  imposed by the Congressional  budget resolutions adopted in 2001 and 2003.  While acknowledging that their real goal  was to make the tax cuts permanent, supporters of those measures opted to ‘‘sunset’’  the tax cuts before the end of the ten-year  budget window, partly in order to avoid recognizing the cost of permanent tax cuts.  Now, a few years from the tax cuts’ expiration, some of these same supporters are trying to act as though the tax cuts are already  permanent and any proposal to offset the  cost of extending them is a ‘‘tax increase.’’  To extend the tax cuts without paying for  them—and to attack those who simply seek  to require that any extension of the tax cuts  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:50 Jun 26, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€8BA~2€8NE~2\H12MR8.REC H12MR 8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008

280,29,2008-03-12,Mr.  CAMPBELL  of  California.,"  I  thank the gentleman from Wisconsin  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, we have heard and we  know this budget has the largest tax  increase  in American history and  it  also doubles the deficit from what the  last Republican budget was. But somehow the majority seems to want to  convince us all that this is good for  America.  Well,  in considering  that,  I’m  reminded of this commercial I see on TV,  this guy named Matthew Lesko. Have  you seen it? He wears this funny suit  with these symbols on it, and they film  it right out here on the west side of the  Capitol. And he clearly makes a great  living. He publishes books to tell people how to get their hands on government money. He says in the commercial:  ‘‘Let Matthew Lesko be your  guide to join the millions each year  who get  free money, grants,  loans,  giant contracts, and  free assistance  from the Federal Government.’’  Here are some of his book titles:  ‘‘Free Money  for Business’’;  ‘‘Free  Money  for  a Better Home’’;  ‘‘Free  Money to Pay Your Bills’’; and, my  personal favorite, ‘‘Free Money to Quit  Your Job.’’  Now, the Democrats would have you  believe that they’re perpetuating with  this budget the concept put forward in  this  commercial,  that  government  money is free. But you know what? It’s  not. Because every dollar that the government sends out in free money to  somebody is a dollar they took, this  government took, from some American  who earned it or that this government  borrowed from some American who has  yet to earn it but will have to pay it  back, plus interest, in the future.  The majority in this budget has refused to set priorities and, instead, is  just spending everybody’s money on everything  and  demanding more  and  more of that money that they would  like to think of as free. But we all  know every single dollar will eventually come from us.  b1615  ",2008

282,29,2008-03-12,Ms. LEE.," Mr. Chairman, let me first  thank Chairman SPRATTfor his leadership and for his work on this budget.  And I want to also thank his staff and  my staff for really helping us put together I think a very good budget that  we support.  This is a budget that, as compared to  the Bush budget,  I  think  the Bush  budget is really the worst that we have  seen in his long line of bad budgets.  And with the staggering $12 billion a  month with regard to the cost of the  occupation of Iraq, I think it is about  $3 trillion being projected, this is dragging our economy further into what we  are calling an ‘‘Iraq recession.’’  It is particularly shameful that the  administration would cut programs at  this point in health care, in food assistance and  in education which would  help so many people who desperately  need it right now.  That is why I am pleased that the  Democratic budget before us rejects  those draconian cuts. And I am also  pleased that this budget is really war  neutral. In fact, as the chairman stated  earlier, the $70 billion placeholder in  this budget can be used for whatever  policy the Congress eventually chooses  in authorizing and appropriating legislation, including redeployment of our  troops. Now, over 90 Members of Congress signed a letter to President Bush  and said that we would not vote for one  more dime for combat operations. Only  we will vote for money to redeploy our  young men and women and bring them  home. So as we approach this fifth anniversary of the invasion and occupation of Iraq, it is far past time that we  act on the will of the American people  by doing exactly that.  So I want to thank the chairman for  this budget. And I urge my colleagues  to support this budget and to work  quickly toward redeploying our troops,  toward addressing the waste, fraud and  abuse  in  the Pentagon  budget  and  begin to bring our troops and our military  contractors  out  of  Iraq  and  refocus our efforts and our budget on  the many domestic needs here at home,  which this budget does.

286,29,2008-03-12,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of this budget, which represents a down payment on our commitment to restore middle class prosperity. It offers a clear and practical  approach to strengthen our economy in  a way that helps our workforce thrive.  It allows  families to reach  for that  American Dream.  Today, the Bush economy continues  to weigh heavily on America’s families  and businesses. Our Republican colleagues call  for  fiscal responsibility.  That call is a sham. George Bush has  added more to the Federal debt than  every  single President  from George  Washington to Ronald Reagan. And at  the same time, median household income has dropped $1,000. In the Clinton  years, median  income rose to $6,100.  Poor economic growth has left nearly  1.6 million more workers unemployed,  and long-term unemployment is up by  62 percent. There are over 3.3 million  fewer manufacturing jobs today than  at the start of this administration. Incomes are flat while everything else  goes up, gas prices,  food prices, the  cost of health care and education.  This is a budget that is strong. It  gets us back to basics. It maintains fiscal discipline while making strong economic growth possible, benefiting all  American  families.  It means crucial  funding for the Democratic Innovation  Agenda and reforms for our tax policy  to reduce burdens on middle class families. It means rejecting the President’s  cuts  to  critical unemployment programs. Now is not the time to undermine already vulnerable communities.  We  can  act  to  rebuild  crumbling  bridges, fix our roads, reduce congestion and make a serious investment in  our infrastructure, paving the way for  new growth and opportunity.  This budget makes real investments  to help workers and create jobs in a fiscally responsible way. It is a budget  that reaches balance in 2012. It reflects  our priorities as a Nation and our belief that government has a commitment to its citizens to make critical  investments in efficient and renewable  energy sources, education, job training  and health care, the foundation of a  strong economy and future growth. It  is about making our workforce more  productive  and making  opportunity  real. It is about staying competitive.  And we share a mutual obligation to  get it right.  Now, Mr. Chairman, I would like to  yield  to  the gentleman  from North  Carolina (Mr. ETHERIDGE) for the purposes of engaging in a colloquy.  ",2008

289,36,2008-03-12,Mr. ROSS.," Madam Chairman, earlier  today my Blue Dog colleagues and I  stood together to offer our official endorsement of Chairman SPRATT’s budget because it is clear that we share the  common goal of eliminating wasteful  government  spending,  adhering  to  strict PAYGO principles, and  finally  addressing the  long-term  fiscal challenges facing this country. Not only  does this budget resolution begin to address our long-term fiscal challenges,  it also includes measures that crack  down on wasteful government spending  so that no tax dollar is wasted.  This budget continues to take steps  to reverse the reckless fiscal policies of  the past 7 years of Republican rule by  incorporating strict PAYGO rules. It  does this in two ways: First, it provides  for fiscally responsible tax relief for 23  million middle-income Americans by  including a fully offset fix to the alternative minimum tax; second, Chairman  SPRATT’s budget resolution includes a  commitment to the extension of the  same statutory PAYGO requirements  which proved instrumental in turning  the  large deficits of the early 1990s  under a Republican into record-budget  surpluses under a Democrat  for the  first time in over 40 years.  The Blue Dogs are committed to addressing the serious  long-term  fiscal  challenges  facing the United States,  and we  should confront  these challenges earlier rather than later so that  we do not pass the burden of unmanageable debt on to our children and  grandchildren.  This administration, this Republican  administration,  has  borrowed more  money from foreigners in the past 7  years than the previous 42 Presidents  combined. It is time to restore common  sense and fiscal discipline and accountability to our government. That’s what  this budget resolution does, and I’m  pleased to stand and speak in support  of it.  ",2008
290,36,2008-03-12,Mr. BOYD of Florida.," Madam Chairman, it’s my privilege to recognize at  this time one of what we call our ‘‘Blue  Puppies,’’ the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. MAHONEY).  ",2008
291,36,2008-03-12,Mr. MAHONEY of Florida.," Madam  Chairman, I rise today to enter into  this colloquy with Mr. BOYDto express  my support for the House budget resolution for fiscal year 2009. A budget is  a reflection of our national priorities.  For far too long, the administration’s  priorities have been misplaced. In fact,  the budget submitted by the President  earlier this year makes cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and the environment.  In addition, it taxes our veterans by requiring them to pay new fees for health  care.  As a result of this administration’s  misplaced priorities, the $5.6 trillion  projected  10-year  surplus  that  they  have inherited has been squandered. As  a  result,  our  children  and  grandchildren are confronted with the challenge of paying back a $9.3 trillion  debt.  This budget before us today, however, is a good budget for Florida and  the Nation. The House budget protects  our homeland by rejecting the President’s cuts to first responder programs,  reinstates funding for the COPS program, and that will put 247 more police  on the street in Florida. This budget  helps Florida’s kids. It provides substantially more money for schools and  education than the President’s budget.  It will allow our schools to hire the  highly skilled teachers that over 25,000  Florida children need desperately to  help them grow up and compete in the  global economy. It rejects the President’s irresponsible new fees that he  wants to put on the backs of our veterans. It increases health care funding  to allow our Veterans Administration  to treat the 5.8 million more patients,  including 333,000 from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.  I support this budget because it is fiscally responsible, it balances the budget by 2012, and it adheres to all of the  PAYGO rules. Finally, I support this  budget because  it protects the most  vulnerable among us: our Nation’s seniors. Specifically, the budget resolution improves support of housing for  the elderly.  I would  like  to  thank Chairman  SPRATT for working with me to ensure  that the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program is adequately funded. I  urge my colleagues to support this bill.  ",2008
292,36,2008-03-12,Mr. BOYD of Florida.," Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAHONEY). He’s been a great  leader, and he’s been successful before  he got here, and he’s going to be a successful Member of Congress.  I will call at this time on really the  fiscal conscience of this House of Representatives, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COOPER).  ",2008
293,36,2008-03-12,Mr. COOPER.," Madam Chairman, I’m  happy to support this budget. One of  the reasons is the extraordinary leadership of  the chairman of  the House  Budget Committee, JOHNSPRATT from  South Carolina. A true gentleman, a  man of wisdom, he has done the difficult work of pulling a very diverse  caucus together, and we appreciate his  listening to Blue Dog concerns.  We are proud of our role as Blue Dogs  as having pulled the Democratic Caucus towards the middle. That’s a good  thing and help make the Democratic  Party the party of fiscal responsibility  in America.  People who know me know that I am  not a very partisan person. I admire  greatly  the  ranking member, ",2008
294,36,2008-03-12,Mr.  RYAN.," I think he has done a great job  in his conference of pulling the many  diverse elements together. It is a tough  job. My primary concern is actually  the long-term, reforming entitlement  programs. Sadly, there’s very little of  that in either of the budgets. There  needs to be a lot more.  I’m championing a bill  right now  called H.R. 3654, the Cooper-Wolf bill,  and I appreciate very much Chairman  SPRATTallowing us to have hearings on  that measure. I’m hoping those hearings will allow this Congress to focus  attention on the need to have an expert  bipartisan commission that will advise  the new President, because problems of  this dimension will take Presidential  leadership to help work on making sure  that Medicare and Social Security and  Medicaid are solvent for the next generation.  So I’m excited about the prospect of  those hearings. I think it is a real opportunity for this Congress to take a  long-term view and to make sure that  the next President is successful in addressing  these  problems. My  friend  from Wisconsin knows the dimension of  these things. These are not easily tackled, but they can and must be addressed in a prompt fashion.  So I think that slowly but surely we  are turning the ship of state here in  the right direction. The statistics that  my  colleague  from Tennessee mentioned about President George W. Bush  having borrowed more money from foreign nations than every previous President  in American history, that’s an  amazing thing. That’s George Washington through Bill Clinton. To have  borrowed more money from foreigners,  all of them put together, is truly an astonishing fact.

297,43,2008-03-12,Mr.  RYAN.,"  Mr. Chairman, the American people  face the greatest  financial challenge  we have ever encountered in the history of the Nation. The free people of  Great Britain overcame the greatest  challenge they ever faced in their history during the early days of the Second  World  War  because  Winston  Churchill told them the truth.  They won the Battle of Britain because they were told by their leaders  the truth, and they could deal with the  truth as Americans can deal with the  truth, but we have got to be told the  truth. Today at  5 o’clock, unfortunately, one of our great public servants  retired, the Comptroller General of the  United States. David Walker, when he  left work today, has moved on to the  private sector.  David Walker is a great public servant who has told the truth, and I want  to reiterate it here on this House floor,  how urgently important it is for the  majority that now that controls this  House to step up and accept responsibility for dealing with this great financial challenge that David Walker has  laid out for us that we in the old Republican majority lost the majority because we did not deal with it.  That’s why you  saw conservatives  like me and many of my colleagues  here today vote against Medicare prescription drugs, vote against the farm  bill, vote against all the expansions of  the government that took place over  the last 7 years because we saw this  challenge.  Mr. Chairman, I have a letter from  David Walker, Comptroller General of  the United States, dated March 13, 2008,  which I would enter into the RECORD.  U.S. GOVERNMENT  ACCOUNTABILITYOFFICE,  Washington, DC, March 13, 2008.  Hon. JOHNCULBERSON,  House of Representatives.  DEARMR. CULBERSON: Per our conversation, this letter discusses our nation’s deteriorating financial condition and the need  for timely action to turn things around.  Our real fiscal problem is not our current  deficit and debt  levels but where we are  headed absent meaningful reforms. Given the  retirement of the baby boomers and soaring  health care costs, government outlays are  set to rise dramatically. The federal government’s liabilities and current unfunded commitments for future spending on Social Security and Medicare are now estimated at $53  trillion and are growing by $2 to $3 trillion a  year. This effectively translates into an IOU  of around $455,000 per American household.  Clearly, our government has already made a  range of promises that it is unlikely to be  able to keep.  Because the personal savings rate in this  country is so low, we have been turning to  overseas investors to finance our nation’s  debt. Foreign investors, particularly foreign  governments, have greatly  increased their  holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, and  some of these government lenders may, either today or over time, have political and  economic  interests that diverge  from our  own. The risk is that some of them may  eventually use their U.S. financial holdings  as leverage against us.  If we continue as we have, policymakers  will eventually have two options: slash government programs and  services  that  the  American people depend upon or raise taxes  to levels that would seriously harm America’s economic growth and competitiveness.  In my view, we probably have at most a 5- to  l0-year window of opportunity to act. Inaction comes with a steep price tag. Recent  projections from Moody’s and an analyst at  Standard & Poor’s suggest that, absent policy changes, our nation is heading toward  ‘‘junk bond’’ status as early as 2020. By 2030,  without  reforms  to entitlement programs  and spending or tax policies,  income tax  rates would have to more than double to prevent a continued erosion of our financial position.  Fortunately, by facing facts and making  meaningful changes to the budgetary process, entitlement programs, other spending,  and tax policies, we can avoid this fiscal  train wreck and ensure that America’s future is better than its past. Our fiscal clock  is ticking, however, and the time for action  is now.  I appreciate the opportunity to express my  thoughts on this important subject.  Sincerely yours,  DAVIDM. WALKER,  Comptroller General of the United States.  David Walker wrote me a letter explaining in a one-pager the financial  challenge facing America. David Walker points out that America’s real financial challenge is not our current deficit  and debt levels, but where we are headed without meaningful reform.  Given  the  retirement of  the baby  boomers and soaring health care costs,  David Walker has certified that the  Federal Government’s  liabilities, the  current financial obligations that all of  us must pay, are so massive that we  are now in a $53-trillion hole, America.  That means every household needs to  write a check today to pay this off.  Every household would have to write a  $455,000 check to pay off that financial  obligation, $175,000 a head.  Every American would have to write  a check today for $175,000 to pay off  this liability. It’s unsupportable, it’s  inexcusable. We have got to deal with  it because David Walker also points  out that we have about 5 to 10 years to  deal with it.  Now that’s critically important information. Everyone says this election  is the most important in our lifetime.  We can say that truly this year. We  know we will need a conservative anchor  in Congress  here  to  restrain  spending. We need to get these entitlement  programs,  Federal  spending  under control, which David Walker estimates is 5 to 10 years, a window of opportunity to act, or he points out that  Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s have  already warned the U.S. Treasury that  by the year 2020, U.S. Treasury bonds  will be rated as junk bonds.  Let me reiterate that, folks. If we  don’t get our financial house in order,  the Comptroller of the United States  has already pointed out that Moody’s  and Standard & Poor’s have already  warned us that our Nation is heading  toward junk bond status for Treasury  bills.  It’s outrageous. It’s unacceptable. We  need to reject this budget. We need to  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:50 Jun 26, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€8BA~2€8NE~2\H12MR8.REC H12MR 8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008
298,50,2008-03-12,Mr. BRADY of Texas.," Mr. Chairman,  as a member of the Joint Economic  Committee on behalf of our  senior  ranking Republican, the Honorable JIM  I rise today to oppose the  Democrats’ irresponsible budget resolution that will only pave the way for  major tax increases and hurt the economy.  SAXTON,  You may recall that 15 months ago,  Democrats took over the control of the  House and the Senate vowing a new direction  for America,  and  in  truth,  we’ve experienced that. Since Democrats took control of both Chambers,  food prices are up, college tuition is up,  health care costs are up, fuel prices are  way up, unemployment is up, the deficit is up.  They vowed that they would do three  things: They would pay every dime of  this war, not mortgage the future. How  much  have  they  paid? Zero. They  vowed they would not raise the debt  limit. In fact, they called it immoral  when we did it. So they did it very  quietly without a vote in the first 60  days they were in control. And they  vowed that they would pay as you go,  that they would not allow any tax increases or relief to go forward without  paying for them, and, of course, they  failed at that as well.  And now we are at a time when the  economy is on the brink of a severe  downturn. The last thing we should be  doing is telling Americans to expect to  pay billions more in taxes in just 2  short years;  $683 billion worth,  the  largest single tax increase in American  history. That averages out to almost  $3,000 per  family every year. And  I  know $3,000 doesn’t sound like a lot in  Washington, DC, where we squander  billions, but for families back in Texas,  and I think most middle class families,  that is far too much to bear, especially  with prices being what they are.  I guess the question we always have,  those of us who believe we ought to  have lower taxes and less spending, is  why does the Democrat budget insist  that  families tighten their belt but  they don’t do anything to tighten the  belt up here in Washington?  Our public wants us to spend more  wisely, not more. And they believe tax  is too high. This budget is just the opposite.  b1945  I don’t know of any economist that  thinks tax increases are good for an  economy in an economic slowdown, and  the timing now is particularly bad. Our  economy has  suffered  some  serious  shocks: Skyrocketing oil prices, the  housing meltdown and mortgage crisis.  We certainly don’t need another one  from here in the Halls of Congress.  And I have to tell you, too, I enjoy  hearing about all  the class warfare  issues. So, we  just asked an  independent  source,  the  Congressional  Budget Office, are  the  rich getting  richer under President Bush? They say  the facts are just the opposite. Quoting  from them, the period between 2000 and  2005 has not been a time of surging income inequality. Instead, the income  gains of the top wealthy 1 percent actually slowed during this period.  In  contrast, between 1992 and 2000, President Clinton’s years, the average income of the top 1 percent skyrocketed  by 84 percent. So the king of inequality  is President Clinton. They just want to  try to hang it on President Bush.

299,57,2008-03-12,Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota.," Mr.  Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the Senate bill (S. 2745) to extend  agricultural  programs  beyond  March 15, 2008, to suspend permanent  price support authorities beyond that  date, and for other purposes.

301,57,2008-03-12,Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of S. 2745, a bill to extend current farm  programs  until April  18,  2008. Mr.  Speaker, our farm policies ensure that  all Americans have access to safe, secure and abundant food supply while  providing a safety net  for American  farmers and ranchers. It also authorizes important nutrition programs for  our country’s neediest citizens, encourages vital conservation programs and  supports  the  development  of  agriculturally based renewable energy.  Mr. Speaker, all of us on the Agriculture Committee would rather have a  new farm bill signed into law rather  than be here today asking for an extension.  After hearing about the popularity of  the 2002  farm bill  from  farmers and  ranchers nationwide in a series of field  hearings our committee held in 2006,  we set out  last year to build on a  strong farm safety net while making  new investments in rural America and  for our Nation’s neediest citizens who  depend on Federal food programs for a  square meal.  The new farm bill that this House  passed last July makes those investments  in nutrition,  fruits and vegetable production and farm-based renewable energy. It reforms our farm programs and reinforces the strong farm  safety net. It includes an agreement  between industry and consumer groups  on mandatory country-of-origin labeling for meat. All that progress will be  lost if we do not get this bill finished  and signed into law.  Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, we are  taking steps toward a bipartisan, bicameral bill that Members can support.  And I believe we have made enough  progress in that endeavor to support a  1-month extension.  So, in closing, I would like to thank  my  friend and the ranking member,  Mr. GOODLATTE from Virginia, for his  work over the last few months and for  standing alongside me in working with  the Senate and the administration in  order to get this farm bill to a conclusion.  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this  bill.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S.  2745, a bill to extend current farm programs  until April 18, 2008.  Mr. Speaker, our farm policies ensure that  all Americans have access to a safe, secure  and abundant  food supply while providing a  safety net for America’s farmers and ranchers.  Farm bills also authorize  important nutrition  programs for our country’s neediest citizens,  encourage vital conservation programs, and  increasingly support the development of agriculturally based renewable energy, which will  help reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  Mr. Speaker, all of us on  the Agriculture  Committee would rather have a new Farm Bill  signed into law rather than to be here today to  ask for an extension. When the House Agriculture Committee kicked off  the Farm Bill  process in 2006 with Farm Bill field hearings  all across America, we hoped a new Farm Bill  for American agriculture would have been  signed into law by now. Even though the farmers and ranchers we heard from in those hearings were strongly supportive of the farm safety net of the 2002 law, we knew passing a  new Farm Bill would not be easy in this kind  of budget environment.  Mr. Speaker, the Farm Bill has been a victim of its own success. The 2002 law saved  taxpayers billions but resulted in a 60 percent  cut in budget authority for traditional farm programs when budget baselines were released a  year ago.  Nevertheless,  the  Agriculture Committee  wrote a Farm Bill from the ground up; a new  Farm Bill  that makes historic  investments  in  fruit and vegetable production, conservation,  nutrition, and  renewable energy while  reinforcing  the strong safety net  for America’s  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:50 Jun 26, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 J:\CRONLINE€8BA~2€8NE~2\H12MR8.REC H12MR 8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008

303,64,2008-03-12,Mr. POMEROY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in favor of  moving the Pension Technical Corrections Act of 2008 forward in an expedited manner. The bill is most needed  by employers who are committed to  providing their employees with a financially secure retirement through a defined benefit plan.  Why do we need this bill? Why do we  need to act this quickly? Let me just  break it down for you.  On August  17,  2006,  the President  signed into law the Pension Protection  Act. This bill imposed sweeping reform  affecting how employers fund their defined  benefits  plans maintained  for  their employees. In addition, the bill  imposed significant reforms for pension  plans offered to many union workers  who  participated  in multi-employer  plans.  However, many  provisions  in  the  PPA became effective on January 1 of  this year. The Treasury Department  and the Internal Revenue Service cannot implement many of these provisions because they need further clarification of congressional intent. This  bill provides the needed clarification  for the Treasury Department, Internal  Revenue  Service,  corporations  and  other businesses who sponsor retirement plans, as well as working families  who contribute to and benefit  from  401(k) plans or defined contribution  plans.  For the employers who have weathered the storm and are persistently  committed to providing a secured retirement for their workers, this bill is  for you. For the beneficiary of a 401(k)  plan who wants to keep money in a retirement plan savings vehicle to  finance  retirement  rather  than being  forced to spend it currently, this bill is  for you. This bill provides clarification  for the correct application of the non-  spousal rollover provision.  For the construction worker whose  plan may be experiencing underfunding  and could be subject to a benefit reduction, this bill will make it clear when  the plan must provide you with the notice alerting you of the plan’s funding  status. It would also clarify whether  you are subject to such a reduction in  pension benefits.  You see, Mr. Speaker, we are talking  about quality-of-life issues for working  families and about helping those employers who want to help their employees provide for a financially secure retirement.  I encourage my colleagues  in this  body and in the Senate to keep this bill  clean and move it quickly. I encourage  them to join me in doing what we were  sent here by our constituents to do,  provide  legislation  to help  improve  their lives. Let’s pass this bill and get  it to the President before the end of  the month, because people are waiting.  We  have  kept  them waiting  long  enough.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2008
304,64,2008-03-12,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  3361, the Pension Protection Technical  Corrections Act. Given the complexity  and broad reach of the Tax Code and  ERISA, and the difficult interactions  between them, the measure before us is  necessary to correct drafting and other  errors in the Pension Protection Act of  2006.  Passage of the legislation will give certainty  to plan administrators, individuals, as well as  government regulators and ensure the intent  of Congress is fully reflected in the governing  statutes.  The technical corrections process is a complicated one which ensures all  views are  heard and which brings  in experts  from  the  relevant committees and Federal agencies.  In this case, it means that bipartisan staff  from both the Ways & Means Committee and  the Education & Labor Committee were joined  by their counterparts from the Senate Finance  Committee and the Senate HELP Committee  as well as representatives from the Treasury  and Labor Departments and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.  Led by the staff of the Joint Tax Committee,  the technical corrections process gives all participants  a  chance  to  review  proposed  changes  to ensure  they reflect  the  intent of  Congress and do not change the substance of  the law itself.  There can be disagreements about what  should and should not be considered  technical. Each participant  in  the process has a  veto. Thus, only items that were unanimously  viewed as correcting a drafting mistake are included in the measure being debated today.  There is one item, called smoothing, that we  viewed as a particularly  important  technical  correction but is not included in this bill because one of the parties to the process said  it was not  technical. Regardless of whether  smoothing is technical, it is extremely important and must be passed quickly. Given that  smoothing was excluded from this bill, I urge  that we take up a smoothing-only bill on suspension this week.  It  is my understanding  that  the Joint Tax  Committee will be publishing on  their web  page a complete summary of these items, and  I encourage interested individuals to review it.  Two final observations, Mr. Speaker, on the  differences between this bill and the version  passed by the Senate in December.  First, since the Senate bill was passed, several additional technical items were identified,  reviewed by the participants, and agreed to as  being technical and conforming changes.  Second,  the Senate-passed bill  included  smoothing and a second provision that is no  longer relevant.  I hope that the Senate takes up the bill that  we are passing today so that it can go to the  President and be signed into law. I also hope  that both houses quickly pass a smoothing-  only bill.  Mr. Speaker, while hardly glamorous,  the  technical corrections process is an important  one, providing clarity and certainty to plan administrators and the millions of Americans who  rely on these plans to help provide a secure  retirement.  I support passage of the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2008
305,64,2008-03-12,Mr. POMEROY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  As we have  just made  formally a  matter of record, the Pension Protection Act was an imperfect piece of legislation. This technically corrects, not  substantively changes, but technically  corrects an imperfect bill. It should go  forward.

310,71,2008-03-12,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  it’s an honor to be before the House  once again. As you know, the 30-Something Working Group, we have been  coming to the floor now for some 5  years to not only share with the Members but also with the American people  on what’s happening here in the Capitol.  I’m going to do a short segment because we have other Members  that  need to come to the floor. And the hour  is late, and tomorrow we’re going to be  working pretty hard past this hour tomorrow, I’m pretty sure. And we want  to make sure that everyone is able to  make it home and do the things that  they need to do to prepare for that day.  Mr. Speaker, with that, I just would  like to say that we’ve been in debate  now for a couple of hours on the budget, the 2009 budget. And I can tell you,  Federal budget, as  it relates to the  House version, I can tell you what I’ve  read and seen of the President’s budget, we have a lot of patching up to do  in that budget.  Tomorrow we will have a number of  different caucuses coming to the floor  presenting their budget, their  ideas.  Some of them came before us today to  talk about some of those issues to be  considered before the full House, and  I’m glad that we are providing that opportunity for the Members to participate in that process; also, to be in debate with the Republicans on Democratic new ideas, moving in a new direction. And I think it’s so very, very  important not only for the Members of  the House to be a part of that exercise,  but also for the American people to  witness that exercise so that they will  know, firsthand, who has the best priorities for the working American people that are out there, and those that  are retired and those that are yet unborn, preparing this Nation to be able  to bring them up in a way and to be  able to have the resources in place so  that they can see the kind of strong  America that I witnessed when I came  about.  Now, let me just share a little bit  about this budget. And it supports fiscal  responsibility and also accountability on government. I think a lot of  the frustration with so many Americans right now is based upon a lack of  accountability, a lack of oversight, a  lack of restraint as it relates to spending. And I think when you have accountability,  you’re  going  to  save  money. I don’t think it, I know it.  Now, 13 years in public service, and 8  years at the State level, I think it’s  important that we embody that. And  this budget, it brings the budget back  to balance by 2010, and our House budget, unlike the President’s budget that  he has proposed, not only to the House,  but to the Senate, also the budget follows PAYGO rules which you say pay  as you go, something that we adopted  in our rules to say if we’re going to  spend it, we’re going to show how we’re  going to pay for it. And I’m glad to see  that we’re still embracing not only  that rule, but also that philosophy as it  relates to the American people, of what  they ask for.  The administration also continues in  the  fiscally  irresponsible  practices.  And in this budget we bring it back to  being responsible. And it’s a real contrast, because since January 2001, a $5.6  trillion, 10-year surplus has been converted into a record deficit. And as you  know, Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor  almost every night to share how that  deficit has crippled America and hasn’t  allowed us to be able to do the things  that we need to do back in our districts.  I  think we  look at  the wasteful  spending;  this administration  is  littered with examples of wasted spending  and  lack of accountability. And I’m  glad that Chairman SPRATT of South  Carolina has  embraced  that  in his  budget that he’s bringing to the floor.  Our budget that we’re bringing on the  Democratic side, we’re looking at not  only strengthening the economy, but  creating jobs and at the same time energy,  education,  jobs,  infrastructure  and innovation will be the watchwords  as we move through this process as  basic principles. And so many Americans can, and also the Members, can go  on www.budget.house.gov to  look at  the Democratic budget because I think  it’s important that we have that level  of transparency so that they can take a  look at the proposals that we are going  to put forward.  So many of my constituents and so  many Americans are challenged by the  cost of energy. And we do know on January 22 of 2001, gas prices were at $1.47.  And now, today it’s at $3.13 per gallon.  And I know many of my constituents  and many of the Americans that are  paying attention  to  the proceedings  here on the floor, they’re saying, well,  Congressman, you’re a little bit off of  that $3.13, because as I moved around  Washington, D.C. today I saw it as a lot  greater.  b2130  We provide, with our budget, as it relates to dealing with some of these gas  issues, it provides a $6.1 billion funding  for renewable energy and energy efficiency  and  other  energy  programs,  which is $1.1 billion, 21 percent more  than the 2008 level.  So we are moving in that direction  making  those kinds of  investments,  and some may translate that into saying that we are pulling ourselves out of  Iraq, out of the Middle East and investing in the Midwest and trying to not  only  push  private  sector  but  also  Americans  in the direction of being  more energy efficient so that we don’t  find ourselves continuing to depend on  the big oil companies.  If I can have my big oil company  chart, I would appreciate it, because I  think it’s important to be able to reflect on it. Also, it rejects President  Bush’s budget cuts of energy efficiency  and  renewable energy programs,  including the cuts to solar energy power,  and also what the President did in terminating the weatherization-assistance  program. We are replacing all of that,  and I think it’s important for Americans to understand what is happening  here.  These big oil companies have reaped  record profits under the Bush administration, and as you can see here in 2002,  it was first $30 billion in record-breaking profits. It then kicked over $59 billion, $82 billion, $109 billion, $118 billion  and $123.3 billion of these oil companies  raking  in these profits. And as you  know, Mr. Speaker, we have moved legislatively to make sure that we call  back some of those giveaways that the  Republican Congress gave  these oil  companies.  And  this has  resulted  in what  I  talked about a little earlier, $1.47 when  the Bush  administration  started  in  January 22, 2001, and it almost sounds  like an inauguration date, and what we  face now at $3.13. The barrel of oil continues to go up.  So this energy investment and being  efficient is very, very important to the  country, also very, very important to  national security.  We also invest in hundreds of billions  of dollars in new investment and green  jobs, green-collar jobs. These are jobs,  Mr. Speaker, that we can’t ship overseas. When we make  our  building  greener, when we make our homes  greener, these are  jobs that anyone  who can even be a high school dropout  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:50 Jun 26, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€8BA~2€8NE~2\H12MR8.REC H12MR 8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008

378,85,2008-03-12,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I welcome the fact that at the real start of  this debate on the Budget Act, we have  an amendment that reflects the best  judgment of Republicans and Democrats alike in the Senate, which is so  key to the future of our country, and  to  listen to our colleagues on both  sides of the aisle at a time when, on so  many issues, there is divisiveness, but  on this issue, there is a real coming together in the Senate on this item for  the support of the America COMPETES  Act.  I wish to commend those who have  been a part of this process over recent  years. It has been truly a bipartisan effort. We  have  listened  to Senator  and  others who have been a part of this  whole process, and it was an enormous  achievement this last year when the  bill passed the Senate. Now, we are imBINGAMAN, Senator ALEXANDER,  pressed by the fact that those who were  involved in making sure this was going  to be achieved are committed to making sure we are going to have muscle  and bones on this project in the form of  providing the resources which are necessary to make it effective. This is, I  think, one of the most important undertakings we will have in this debate  and discussion on the budget, and I am  very hopeful we will get a strong vote  in support of this amendment.  Very briefly, I think all of us understand the average family in this country is exceedingly hard-pressed at this  time. They are wondering whether they  are going to be able to pay their mortgages, and we are  finding out that  many are unable to pay their mortgages and they are losing their homes,  or they have the threat of losing their  homes.  It  is difficult to  imagine,  I  think, for many of us, when parents go  to bed at night and wonder whether  they are going to be able to afford their  mortgages and maintain their home for  themselves,  their  families,  and  for  their children, but it is happening in  too many parts of this country. At the  same  time,  those  same parents are  wondering if they are going to be able  to heat their homes, at least in my  part of the country. With the fact of  the extraordinary explosion of the cost  of home heating oil, we find so many  families are hard-pressed to be able to  provide heating for their homes.  These are families who have worked  hard, who have played by the rules all  their lives, and they are wondering now  about what the  future will hold  for  themselves and for their parents and  for their children. Are they going to be  able to make sure their parents are  going to be able to live their golden  years in peace and dignity? They are  hard-pressed to provide the extra help  and assistance to them so they can afford  their  prescription  drugs. They  have seen the cost of tuition go up and  continue to go up, and they wonder if  they will be able to educate their children; while fuel and gas go up, whether  they will be able to fill the gas tank to  get to their jobs where they are working. There is enormous anxiety. There  is also the concern about rising health  care costs. There is enormous rising  anxiety out in the country. People are  wondering: Why should my job be at  risk? I have worked hard. I have played  by the rules. I have done everything I  possibly can, and still I wonder whether in a few years, the opportunities for  my children are going to be as great as  opportunities were for me. I know my  parents sacrificed so I would be able to  make  progress,  and  now  I wonder  whether my children are going to be  better off than I was. That is going on  in home after home across this country.  It is as a result of the failure of economic policy. It is a failure of fiscal  and monetary policy over the period of  recent years. It is not the fault of these  particular families; it is the fault of  economic policy and giving the kinds  of investments in our country and investments in individuals that are necessary in order to have a strong economy. We know how to do it. We have  seen it done. I am not going to take the  time of the Senate to go back over the  history where it has been done and it  should be done.  So we are faced with where we are  today, and this calls for immediate assistance  for these  families. We have  seen the efforts that have been made in  terms of housing and in terms of the  unemployment, the help and assistance  of fuel assistance and food stamps and  others to try to address the immediate  kinds of problems families are facing.  We also have to look at where we are  going to be as a country in terms of the  future, where we are going to be in 3 to  5 years as we are seeing this whole  global economy challenge the United  States. One overarching  fact  is that  the future is going to be the knowledge  economy, the economy that puts the  premise on knowledge and information  and education. That is where the future is going to lie. That will be the  great competition between the countries of Asia and the United States. We  are thinking about how we are going to  address that, and the COMPETES Act  is one of the important solutions to  this challenge.  Mr. President,  if we  look at  this  chart here, it is interesting in terms of  U.S. students. To be globally competitive, we need to tackle the achievement gaps. U.S. students from high-income families outperform students in  other countries  in math, while U.S.  students from low-income families lag  behind. When you are talking about  international competitiveness, we find  that U.S.  students who  come  from  higher income families are able to go  to schools that are able to afford the  good teachers, are able to out-compete  the  students  in other parts of  the  world. It is no mystery about how that  should be done. But students who come  from  lower  income  families are not  able to keep pace. This legislation is  designed to, among other things, reduce this gap that exists now in our  country.  Look at this chart. We have more  math classes in high-poverty schools  that are taught by teachers without a  major in that subject. You have low-  poverty secondary schools where the  percentage of secondary school math  classes  taught  by  teachers without  that major is 26 percent. In the high-  poverty schools, it is 56 percent. Much  of it comes down to teachers and the  importance of  investing  in them, to  make sure they are going to have the  skills to serve in communities and in  school districts all over the country,  and so they are going to have the competency. If you are not going to have  the high-quality  teachers  in underserved areas, then you are going to  have those kinds of results we saw with  the other chart where American children are going to fall further and further behind. It is in this very area that  the COMPETES Act is directed.

380,92,2008-03-12,Mr. CONRAD.," Well, that is the unfortunate part of, as I see it, the amendment of  the Senator  from Arizona.  What he is doing is saying—he is asking all of us, all Americans, to put our  name on the bill. But the money is  only going to two-tenths of 1 percent of  us. I think that is unfortunate.  ",2008
381,92,2008-03-12,Mr. KYL., Will the Senator yield?  ,2008
382,92,2008-03-12,Mr. DURBIN., I will yield when I am  done.  ,2008
383,92,2008-03-12,Mr. KYL., I think it would be fair to  let me answer.  ,2008
384,92,2008-03-12,Mr. DURBIN.,"  I think the Senator  from North Dakota has the floor. I am  sure he will yield to the Senator from  Arizona.  So that I understand this—I want to  make it clear—in order to spare, at a  maximum, 7,000 of the wealthiest people in America who may die in the outgoing years, in order to spare them estate tax liability, even though America  has been very kind to them and they  have lived very comfortable lives because of this great Nation, to spare  them the possibility of paying back to  this country for having lived and enjoyed this great Nation, we are going  to add some $400 billion plus in debt to  Americans. And over half of that will  end up being debt we owe to foreign  countries, as I understand the Senator  from North Dakota. Is that correct?  ",2008
385,92,2008-03-12,Mr. CONRAD., I think that is clearly  correct.  ,2008
386,92,2008-03-12,Mr. DURBIN.," So for those who are  so-called fiscal conservatives, we are  going to cut taxes for the wealthiest  people in America, and add debt for everyone else in America, an added debt  we are going to borrow from overseas  and ask our children to pay for it. It  sounds like a great idea if you happen  to be  in the  lucky 7,000 club. This  lucky 7,000 club that will be benefitted  by Senator KYL’s amendment will have  a great outcome. It appears that everyone loses—I take that back. Everyone  but China and Japan and other countries will be losers in this proposal by  the Senator from Arizona. Is that correct?  ",2008
387,92,2008-03-12,Mr. CONRAD.," Yes, I think that is undeniably the case. The problem this  country confronts now is we have massive deficits and, under this President,  a dramatic increase in the debt. So all  of these provisions are based on borrowed money. So why would we go borrow this amount of money, which is increasingly from foreign countries, in  order to give a benefit to two-tenths of  1 percent of the American people, when  99.8 percent of the estates in this country are already exempted from the taxation? That is lost on me.  ",2008
388,92,2008-03-12,Mr. DURBIN.," If I can ask one more  question—I know the Senator from Arizona wishes to speak—aside from the  lucky 7,000 club the Senator from Arizona is taking care of, the wealthiest  people in America—nothing but good  luck, they have lived comfortable lives  in a great democratic, free nation with  the protection of our laws, and now, as  they leave and go to perhaps a better  place, they want to make sure they do  not pay back to this Nation, aside from  the lucky 7,000 club.  I wish to ask the Senator from North  Dakota,  I have heard  this concept,  talking about pay as you go, that the  Democrats, when they came to control  the Congress, would pay for any tax  cuts or any spending increases so it  would not add to the national debt. So  I wish to ask the Senator from North  Dakota, I know he believes in it very  passionately: Is this a pay-as-you-go  proposal from the Republican side so  that there is no net loss to future generations? Is this being taken care of by  the Senator from Arizona offsetting it,  for example, with an increase in taxes  on maybe working people of this country or some other group or cutting  spending in some other area?  ",2008
389,92,2008-03-12,Mr. CONRAD.," No, this is all put on  the tab. This is all borrowed money.  ",2008
390,92,2008-03-12,Mr. DURBIN., I thank the Senator.  ,2008

I know they are inaccurate. I  wish to comment further on the Senator’s amendments.  ",2008

398,92,2008-03-12,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I appreciate  the fact that the chairman of the Budget Committee and the majority whip  have done some extrapolation from the  number of people who die and two-  tenths of a percent of this and that  and, therefore, they have come up with  a number. Why don’t I quote the actual  numbers according to the Joint Tax  Committee. These  are  the  officials  numbers we deal with every year when  calculating the effect of our legislation. According  to  the Joint Committee on Taxation, if my amendment  were to be adopted, 11,800 estates each  year would be required to file at the exempted levels that are set forth in my  amendment. If we fail to act, 131,000  families, not 7,000—family businesses,  farms and so on—will be subjected to  the death tax each year, starting in the  year 2011.  The point is, these are not individuals. These are families or businesses  with a lot more people affected by the  tax than the number of filers. The filer  represents all the members of the family or the employer of a company. That  may be 50 or 60 or 200 people who may  be out of a job. But that is how many  will be subjected to filing this, 131,000.  You might make fun of this and say  it is a small percentage of the number  of people in the United States. If you  are unfortunate enough to die and your  heirs have to deal with this problem, it  is a very real problem to every single  one of them. Over a 10-year period, obviously, you are talking about way  more than a million people. You may  say that is not a significant enough  number  to worry  about,  but  it  is  enough. We worry about a few people  who suffer from all kinds of things that  we try to deal with. If you have a million Americans over a 10-year period  subjected to an unfair tax, it is a problem we ought to address and not just  make fun of the fact that it is only a  million instead of 50 or 60,000. So let’s  get the numbers right. You can argue,  if it is only 131,000 people, should we be  worried about it. I say yes, somebody  on the other side might say no, but at  least let’s get the numbers right.  ",2008
399,92,2008-03-12,Mr. GREGG., Will the Senator yield?  ,2008
400,92,2008-03-12,Mr. KYL., Yes.  ,2008

402,92,2008-03-12,Mr. KYL.," That is correct, on the motion to  instruct conferees, 56 Democrats and Republicans voted for this  identical proposal.  ",2008
403,92,2008-03-12,Mr. GREGG.," I wish to ask the Senator further, through the Chair: As I  understand the proposal, estates over  $10 million would continue to be subject to  full estate tax obligation;  is  that correct?  ",2008
404,92,2008-03-12,Mr. KYL.," That is correct. The rate  would be reduced from 55 percent, if we  don’t do anything, to 35. I believe the  majority proposal  is 45. This would  make the top rate no higher than 35  percent.  ",2008
405,92,2008-03-12,Mr. GREGG.," So we aren’t talking  about the wealthiest Americans. We  are talking about people with significant wealth, up to $10 million. But a  family farm can easily be valued at $10  million. A small business, a restaurant  could easily be valued at $10 million. A  small software company could easily  be valued at $10 million. So we are  talking  about  continuing,  without  major tax consequences, small businesses and farms that otherwise would  be subjected to a very onerous tax  which might put them out of business;  is that not correct?

407,99,2008-03-12,Mr. MARTINEZ.," Mr. President, in a  recent column discussing the disaster  that  the Castro  regime has visited  upon  Cuba,  columnist George Will  wrote about another Cuban, Armando  Valladares, who withstood the regime’s  brutal prison system for 22 years. Of  the prison’s conditions, Will wrote:  Some doors are welded shut and prisoners  are fed watery soup sometimes laced with  glass, or dead rats, or half a cow’s intestine,  rectum included, containing feces.  This  is  the ugly  reality of what  speaking openly against the Castro regime gets you in Cuba. Today there are  hundreds of political prisoners in the  many prisons that have cropped up  since the Castro regime took power.  Dr. Biscet is one of those prisoners, a  noble and decent man choosing to fight  for a cause greater than his own, risking everything in the process.  Throughout U.S. history, Congress,  as an institution, has recognized those  who stand up for democracy, the rule  of law, and human rights. We owe Dr.  Biscet and those he inspires the honor  of knowing that we support his worthy  efforts and that Americans share his  desire for seeing freedom take root in a  country plagued by oppression for far  too long.  Awarding this honor to a man with  such  courage  and  conviction  will  strengthen his cause and the cause of  all Cubans and send a message to the  Cuban regime that they are on the  wrong side of history, and they are on  the wrong side of what is good and is  right.  I urge my colleagues to support this  man who seeks democratic change and  the recognition of human rights by bestowing this honor of a Congressional  Gold Medal to Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet.  Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of time on this busy day on the  floor. I know Senator MENENDEZwishes  to speak on this issue, but at this time  I yield the floor, and I thank the chairman for the time allowed.  ",2008
408,99,2008-03-12,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. President,  I  rise with my colleague and friend, Senator MARTINEZ, in strong support of our  resolution to recommend Cuban dissident and political prisoner Dr. Oscar  MARTINEZ NELSON Elias Biscet for the Congressional Gold  Medal. This medal is the Nation’s highest and most distinguished  civilian  award, and I can think of few who are  more deserving than this man. For his  courageous commitment to democracy,  for his unwavering defense of human  rights, for his lifetime of working for  peaceful change on an  island where  freedom dares not speak its name, Dr.  Biscet has earned the admiration of his  community, and he has earned the recognition of this Congress.  Just over 4 months ago, both Senator  and I, along with Senators  and SALAZAR, stood on this  floor and declared our solidarity with  about 70 Cuban youths who had just  been thrown in jail. Their crime was  nothing more than wearing this simple  white bracelet  that  says one word,  ‘‘cambio,’’ change.  This one simple gesture was strong  enough to have them held as prisoners.  This one simple gesture was strong  enough to have them detained and harassed. But as I said on the  floor 4  months ago, I also hoped this one gesture would be strong enough to inspire  us and to inspire those who love freedom and democracy and have respect  for human rights around the globe.  Today we stand here once again, in  solidarity, to recognize someone who  has  shown  courage  over  and  over  again—courage  in defense of human  rights and democracy courage to speak  out about the future he wants to see on  the island of Cuba.  When I  last came to the  floor to  speak of Dr. Biscet, it was 1 week before he received the Presidential Medal  Freedom, the highest civilian award  bestowed by the President. Unfortunately,  he  received  the  award  in  absentia. He received it this way because has been languishing in the jails  of the Castro regime, serving a 25-year  prison sentence.  And he continues to languish there  today. His  crime? Seeking peaceful  change  in his  country. His  crime?  Hanging a  flag sideways. His crime?  Fighting against a repressive regime.  By awarding the Congressional Gold  Medal to Dr. Biscet, we would create a  physical  representation of  so many  years of political bravery.  In that medal, we will see a shining  image of his courage and accomplishments.  In that medal, we will see the patient  suffering of Dr. Biscet’s wife, the fellow  democracy  advocate,  Elsa Morjeon  Hernandez, and the patient suffering of  his two children who have had to grow  up with their father in jail.  In that medal, we will see the 3 years  Dr. Biscet spent  in prison, 3 years,  after hanging the national flag sideways at a press conference.  In that medal, we will see that once  he was released, Dr. Biscet organized  engaged organizing  seminars on  the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and continued to fight every day to  bring democracy and justice to Cuba.  And in that medal, we will see a solid  beacon of hope for the people of that island, recognition that people inspired  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:46 Mar 13, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G12MR6.017 S12MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 1 6 C P D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2008
409,113,2008-03-12,Mrs. LINCOLN.,"  I would also note  that we had 25 Senators who joined us  in a letter to the Budget Committee recently requesting this as a priority in  the budget, and I would encourage my  colleagues  to  take  a  look  at  this  amendment and join us because it is  truly  the  right  thing  to  do. This  amendment would  provide  an  additional $50 million for the Veterans Benefits Administration.  In the scheme of things, and how we  talk about things in Washington, $50  million is not a great deal. It is not a  huge amount in the overall scheme of  the dollars we talk about in our Nation’s budget. But we believe it can  truly make a difference in providing  the Veterans Benefits Administration  with the additional resources it desperately  needs  to more  effectively  meet its increasing workload and its  unacceptability in terms of the large  backlog of pending claims.  In recent years, Congress has taken  the lead in tackling the claims backlog  and improving the management of the  VBA. In last year’s budget, much needed resources were provided to increase  the number of claims processing staff  essential  to  reducing  the  pending  claims  backlog  and  improving  the  timeliness of that claims process.  There is not a Member in this body,  I am sure, who has not dealt with, in  their constituent  services and  their  casework, the issues of veterans’ benefits that have been backlogged, the  time it takes to get these veterans the  benefits  they  deserve.  They  have  fought hard for this country and need  and deserve those benefits.  The leadership and guidance of Chairman AKAKAand Chairman CONRADand  their staffs certainly made all of this  possible. Today we seek to invest further  in the commitment we already  made in last year’s budget and what we  were pushing forward and were successful in, in terms of additional funding  for the VBA dealing with that backlog  of cases.  According to the Veterans Benefits  Administration’s  Workload  Report  from March 8, 2008, the total number of  pending  compensation  and  pension  claims was 666,710. That was up from  627,429 this time last year. So we are  seeing an  increase  in our  caseload  while all the while we still have a  backlog in those cases that are pending.  The amount that has been pending  for more than 180 days is nearly 27 percent. Additionally, claims requiring a  disability rating determination, which  are the most time consuming and resource intensive to the process, have  increased more than 50 percent since  2003.  This is inexcusable—veterans who return home from Iraq and Afghanistan,  veterans who are out there with disability  claims  from  other  circumstances, who have been put into  these backlogs.  It  is  continuing  to  grow. We are only asking for $50 million to be able to improve upon that  situation for these veterans.  Between the fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year  2007,  the number of  filed  claims increased 45 percent, from almost 579,000 to 838,000. For fiscal year  2009, the VA, which has consistently  underestimated  its workload  in  the  past, projects the number to increase  to approximately 872,000. These numbers are increasing and we have to get  a handle on it so we can stop those  overloads and certainly the workloads  that are backlogged.  Further, the VA cautions that ongoing hostilities in Iraq and Afghanistan  could increase its workload even further. So we know unfortunately there  is not going to be a lessening. There is  only, more than likely, going to be an  increase. We have to make sure we  have the resources there.  In light of all these mounting challenges, this amendment would provide  an additional $50 million to the VBA’s  general administration account so it  would have the flexibility to explore  pilot programs and  invest more  in  training or technology  initiatives to  help tackle the claims backlog. This is  not a process that is going to go away  if we do not address it. It is simply not  fair to our veterans.  It  complements  the  recommendations that are provided in the Budget  Views and Estimates  from both the  House and Senate Committees on Veterans’ Affairs. As discussed  in those  documents——  (Disturbance  lery.)  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will suspend. The  Sergeant at Arms will restore order.  ",2008

I continue with my passionate plea on behalf of the soldiers,  the brave American men and women  who serve this great country. In what  we have seen in the backlog, through  the  Veterans’  Administration,  certainly it is an indication that we can  do a better job in providing those benefits to the service men and women who  have done such a courageous job on behalf of this great Nation and all of us.  What I recommended in my amendment  are  recommendations  that  I  think  complement  the  recommendations provided in the Budget Views and  Estimates  from both the House and  Senate Committees on Veterans’ Affairs.

416,120,2008-03-12,Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.," This  is  part of the allocating, part of the stimis  ulus package as  it  is right now  for  emergency spending. What it would do  is it would allocate part of the $35 billion already set aside in the budget to  be added to the $3.5 billion to make a  total of $7 billion. It doesn’t add any  more to the deficit or outside of the  deficit than is currently indicated in  the current budget resolution. In other  words, of the $35 billion right now, only  $3.5 billion is allocated to infrastructure. With this amendment, $7 billion  would be allocated to infrastructure.  ",2008
417,120,2008-03-12,Mr. GREGG.," So if I could ask the  Senator another question, the Senator  from Nebraska  is  saying  that  his  amendment simply reallocates the $35  billion——  ",2008

419,120,2008-03-12,Mr. GREGG., But there was $35 billion  put in the mark that was available for  stimulus. Is the Senator reallocating  those dollars or is the Senator putting  $3.5 billion on top of those dollars?  ,2008
420,120,2008-03-12,Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.," Not on  top. We are reallocating, of that $35 billion, an additional $3.5 billion within  the $35 billion to infrastructure, making a total of $7 billion within the $35  billion.  ",2008
421,120,2008-03-12,Mr. GREGG.," And if I could ask further, where is the Senator taking the  money from?  ",2008
422,120,2008-03-12,Mr.  NELSON  of  Nebraska.,"  It  wouldn’t be  taking money  from,  it  would be allocating money that has  not yet been allocated. So there would  be other projects that would not be  funded because of this, but it wouldn’t  be taking any money away from anything already allocated because  the  balance of it is unallocated.

427,120,2008-03-12,Mr. CONRAD.," Madam President, the  Senator  from Nebraska  is  exactly  right. What he  is  doing with  this  amendment, which I support, is of the  $35 billion which  is unallocated, the  second stimulus package, an insurance  policy against further economic downturn, he doesn’t add any money. What  he does is of the $3.5 billion that was  reserved for infrastructure in the $35  billion, he is doubling that amount to  $7 billion of the $35 billion for infrastructure.  I think that is a wise thing to do because I frankly think the infrastructure projects are the most stimulative.  We know for every $1 billion spent on  highways and bridges, 45,000 jobs are  created, and those are jobs in America.  As my colleague knows, the money is  reserved—the  Budget  Committee  doesn’t have the ability to dictate at  the end of the day how it is used. Committees of  jurisdiction will do that.  But what the Senator from Nebraska is  doing is sending a message that of this  $35 billion, instead of $3.5 billion dedicated for infrastructure projects that  are ready to go—and, in fact, we know  there are more than $3.5 billion of infrastructure projects ready to fund.  ",2008
428,120,2008-03-12,Mr. GREGG.," Madam President, if I  could reclaim my time, I think the explanation is that this is a reallocation  within the $35 billion which was in the  original budget, which basically was  added to the deficit.  ",2008

After 63  Senators voted on a bipartisan basis  for this amendment last year, it was  stripped  in  the conference. Unfortunately, this is the kind of thing that  tends to undermine public confidence  in what we are doing, when we see a  strong bipartisan show of support for a  commonsense amendment and then, behind closed doors, it is later stripped  from the legislation.

464,127,2008-03-12,Mr. BIDEN.," Madam President,  I  thank  the  chairman of  the Budget  Committee. It is a job I don’t envy.  Let me say at the outset, I have two  purposes in rising today. One is, I am  going to, at the end of my comments,  introduce an amendment that restores  full funding for the 150 function, the  State Department budget, cosponsored  by Senators FEINSTEIN, SMITH, DURBIN,  SUNUNU, DODD, MARTINEZ, MENENDEZ,  SNOWE,  KERRY,  COLLINS,  LEVIN,  VOINOVICH, OBAMA, CORKER, LEAHY, and  HAGEL.  What I rise to speak to now is an  amendment  already  at  the  desk,  amendment No. 4164. That amendment  will add $551 million to the $599 million  already provided in the budget resolution for the COPS Program for a total  funding of $1.15 billion. I thank the  Budget Committee for allocating the  $599 million to the COPS Program in  this resolution. That is a significant  increase  from  the President’s priorities. In fact, for the first time since its  inception in 1994, the President’s budget proposes to eliminate the COPS Program  entirely.  I  am  offering my  amendment to get us closer to  full  funding of the level of $1.15 billion that  proved  successful  in  driving  down  crime in the 1990s.  I realize I am a broken record on this  issue. Each year my colleagues hear me  come down and talk about the COPS  Program, the fact that we have to fully  fund the program. Why am I such an  advocate for the COPS Program? Mostly because I wrote the original legislation. There is a tendency around here,  if you write something, you hang onto  it, even if it no longer functions. But  that is not the reason. It is not pride of  authorship.  I  support  it because  it  works. It worked. It continues to work.  And it will work even better if we fund  it.

467,134,2008-03-12,Mr. DURBIN.," Lucky 7,000.  I would like to ask the Senator from  New Hampshire, if I might, is he aware  of the companies that took advantage  of the H–1B visas in 2006, which companies led in the number of H–1B visa  awards?  ",2008
468,134,2008-03-12,Mr. GREGG.," Well, I know the Senator from Illinois doesn’t like the H–1B  visa program, doesn’t desire it to be expanded. I appreciate that and I understand we have a difference of opinion  on that, and when he wants time, I will  be happy to listen to his views again.  But the fact is I happen to think, even  though there may have been abuses in  the program, I don’t think they were at  the core of the problem; that the primary energy of this program has been  to create jobs in the United States by  bringing smart people here.  We should be going across the world  and saying to the best and the brightest——  ",2008

We would  like to consider you as being a participant under an H–1B visa program.  ",2008
471,134,2008-03-12,Mr. DURBIN., Will the Senator yield  for a question?  ,2008
472,134,2008-03-12,Mr. GREGG., Yes.  ,2008
473,134,2008-03-12,Mr. DURBIN.," The Senator inadvertently misstated my position. I know it  was an accident. We are good friends.  He is probably not aware I do support  the H–1B.  But is the Senator aware that out of  the top 10 companies that secured H–1B  visas, 6 of those companies were Indian  corporations; 5,000 visas to Infosys, an  Indian corporation which  is a body  shop which moves H–1B engineers from  India to the United States for a fee and  then back to India to compete with  American companies; WoodPro, which  is the second  largest company, 4,000  visas; and the first American company  on the list for H–1B visas was Microsoft, with 3,000. So 9,000 had already  been awarded to Indian companies, and  the Government of India has said the  H–1B  is what  they  consider  their  outsourcing visa so they can send engineers to the United States to learn how  to compete against American companies.  Does the Senator believe that is an  abuse which should be addressed?  ",2008
474,134,2008-03-12,Mr. GREGG.," Well, I would say to the  Senator from Illinois that when you  bring a person here who has the capacity to add to the strength of a Microsoft, for example, which is probably our  single biggest international producer of  economic activity for us as a nation,  after maybe, I don’t know, Wal-Mart,  but it is a value-added company of the  first level, and that when you bring  somebody here who Microsoft  feels  adds to their ability to be more competitive, if that person decides to go  back to India or back to China, well,  that will be a choice they make.  But I suspect the odds are pretty  good if that person has the opportunity  to stay here under an H–1B visa program, they will probably end up staying here, or at least a large enough percentage of them will stay to add to our  economy.  Now, what my amendment does——  ",2008
475,134,2008-03-12,Mr. DURBIN., Will the Senator yield?  ,2008
476,134,2008-03-12,Mr. GREGG.," I will in a second. What  my amendment does, to make it clear,  is it recaptures visas that are unused  and it uses those visas now. It also specifically  targets  bringing  in  high-  skilled nursing, people who are trained  in the nursing facility area, which is  very much in demand right now.  ",2008
477,134,2008-03-12,Mr. DURBIN., Will the Senator yield?  ,2008
478,134,2008-03-12,Mr. GREGG., Certainly. Of course.  ,2008
479,134,2008-03-12,Mr. DURBIN., Does the Senator feel  the option of job vacancies that may be  filled by H–1B visa holders should first  be offered to Americans to fill those  jobs before an H–1B visa is given to a  person coming from another country?  ,2008
480,134,2008-03-12,Mr. GREGG.," I happen to believe the  H–1B program is one of those programs  that expands jobs in the United States,  and by getting people here, you actually create jobs and you will create  more jobs for Americans rather than  lose jobs.  So, no, I don’t happen to think you  create a uniform rule that says nobody  can come here if somebody else can  take  the  job because  then you are  going to get the bureaucracy behind  that which would basically bar those  people from ever getting here. That becomes then a bureaucratic nightmare  for building those jobs. It makes much  more sense to bring these smart, intelligent people here, have them create  jobs here, rather than leave them creating jobs in China and India.  Bill Gates speaks to this far more  eloquently than  I do. He speaks to  most things more eloquently than I  can  because he  can  pronounce  the  words. But as a practical matter, he  says these people are centers for the  energy that creates the ideas, that creates the jobs that drive the economy.  And if you leave them in China, if you  leave them in India, as those types of  individuals creating jobs, they become  huge competitors to the entrepreneurship of America. If you bring them  here,  they become adjuncts  to our  economy.  I think the proposal makes a lot of  sense from the standpoint of job creation and from the standpoint of making our economy stronger, so I will be  offering it later in the day.  I yield the floor.

We already have a very long  line of amendments  in the queue.

500,148,2008-03-12,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from South Dakota.  AMENDMENTNO. 4268  ,2008
501,148,2008-03-12,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak  to amendment No.  4268. This  amendment would provide for a total of  $200 million over the next 5 fiscal years  for tribal justice and law enforcement.  Specifically, this amendment would do  two  things  in a  fiscally  responsible  way. First, it would increase the BIA’s  public  safety  and  justice  account,  which  funds tribal  law enforcement,  tribal court systems, and tribal detention centers by $25 million a year for  the next 5 years. Second, it would increase  funding  for U.S. attorneys to  prosecute crimes in Indian Country by  $15 million a year for the next 5 years.  The need for this amendment on our  Nation’s reservations cannot be overstated, as the absence of basic levels of  public safety is reaching a crisis point.  The statistics are startling. Nationally, studies show that one of every  three Native American women will be  raped in their lifetime. Crime rates on  remote reservations are an average of  10 times higher than the rest of the Nation. The Department of Justice has  found that American Indian women are  21⁄2 times more likely to be raped or  sexually  assaulted  than  women  throughout the rest of the country.  In my home State of South Dakota,  homicide rates within reservations are  almost  10  times higher  than  those  found in the rest of South Dakota. According  to  the BIA, Standing Rock  Sioux Tribe has the second highest rate  of crime of all the reservations in the  Nation.  In order to start to help improve public safety on our Nation’s reservations,  there needs to be a two-part solution.  First, we have to ensure there are adequate  law enforcement personnel on  the reservations to respond to, to investigate, and to deter crime—something that is not currently happening.  For example, again, my home State of  South Dakota,  the  Standing Rock  Sioux Tribe, which sits on the border of  North and South Dakota and occupies  over 2 million acres of land, currently  has only 16 commissioned police officers. That works out to no more than  three officers a shift for over 2 million  acres of land.  To  put  that  in  perspective,  the  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe  land  is  more than two times larger than the  State of Rhode Island, which has 200  sworn State troopers plus additional  county, city, and Federal officers. That  means Rhode Island has 12 times as  many State troopers as the Standing  Rock Sioux Tribe has law enforcement  officers, to police half the land.  Rhode Island also has 10 State trooper police dogs, meaning that at any  given time, Rhode Island has more canine officers patrolling than Standing  Rock Indian Reservation has human  law enforcement officers. While there  are population discrepancies between  the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and  Rhode Island, the differences between  the two are still startling. My amendment addresses this need to increase  the number of law enforcement officers  on reservations by increasing funding  for the BIA’s public safety and justice  account.  Second, there has to be some assurance that those who have been arrested, especially  those arrested  for  violent crimes, are prosecuted to the  fullest extent of the law. Over the past  two decades, only 30 percent of tribal  land crimes referred to U.S. attorneys  were prosecuted, according to Justice  Department data compiled by Syracuse  University. This compares with 56 percent of all other cases.  My amendment addresses this need  with an increase in the BIA’s Public  Safety and Justice Account, which also  funds tribal courts, and an increase for  U.S. attorneys to prosecute crimes in  Indian country.  The bottom line is that violent crime  has become a serious problem on our  reservations, particularly on our reservations in South Dakota, and I am  determined to help reduce it. This $20  million increase in spending in fiscal  year 2009 is small, less than 4/1000 of 1  percent  of  the  total  discretionary  spending  in  fiscal year 2009  in this  budget resolution, but it will have a  big impact on the reservations that are  truly in need.  I hope my colleagues will support  this amendment so we can start restoring basic public safety to our Nation’s  Indian reservations.  METHHOTSPOTSBUDGETAMENDMENT  Mr. President, I would also like to  speak about an amendment that I filed  earlier this afternoon, amendment No.  4269.  This amendment, which would provide for a total of $99 million in COPS  meth hot spots funding for fiscal year  2009.  The underlying budget resolution assumes $70 million for this program, and  my amendment simply provides the additional funds needed for a total of $99  million, as authorized by the Combat  Meth Act. This  important  program  trains State and local law enforcement  to investigate and lock up meth offenders.  In 2006, we passed the Combat Meth  Act, which authorizes an additional $99  million per year for 5 years under the  COPS Meth Hot Spots Program.

503,162,2008-03-12,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President,  I  would like to express my sorrow regarding  the  tragic death of one of  Washington’s  finest  young  environmental advocates Shannon Harps on  December 31, 2007. She was killed by an  unknown assailant as she was returning to her Capitol Hill apartment in  Seattle from the grocery store. Shannon’s death is a tremendous loss to our  community and the many  issues to  which she devoted her life. I join with  Shannon’s  family,  friends,  and  colleagues in the Sierra Club in mourning  the loss of this wonderful person and  fine community organizer. Though her  life was cut short, she was able to  make a large impact on the quality of  the Northwest environment.  Shannon came from her home State  of Ohio to Seattle, WA, in February  2004 to join the staff of the northwest  office of the Sierra Club. This move  joined two of Shannon’s strongest desires to work to protect our environment and to  live  in the Northwest  where she could more vigorously pursue her strong love for the outdoors.  Shannon had a wonderful sense of  humor and a style of working with people that immediately put them at ease  and made it easy for them to join her  in  protecting  our  environment  and  quality of  life. Shannon particularly  enjoyed working with high school and  college students to help them develop  their interests and talents in working  to create a better world. While Shannon’s work was directly focused on protecting our environment, from wilderness  to global warming, her values  were deeply embedded in a strong sense  of fairness and justice for all people.  In the 4 years that Shannon lived in  Washington State she helped to protect  some  of  our  finest  lands. Shannon  worked with Sierra Club volunteers  and staff from the many groups to help  move the Wild Sky Wilderness proposal  through the various steps of its arduous journey through the congressional  process. She spent countless hours on  the phone,  in meetings, and on the  trail helping to bring people together  to advocate  for protection of  these  spectacular wild  lands. Shannon believed that people were better advocates if they had firsthand knowledge  of the places they were advocating for.  As part of this belief she led countless  hikes  into  some  of Washington’s  wildest lands.  Shannon’s was a natural  leader  in  the State of Washington and worked  with colleagues around the country to  help thwart the various efforts to open  up America’s Arctic Coastal Plain to  oil and gas drilling. She was a lead organizer in the successful effort in 2006  to pass the renewable energy portfolio  standard for Washington State. And, in  the recent 2 years, much of her work  focused on building relationships with  local officials and creating public support so they would endorse the mayor’s  Climate Protection Agreement.  In her all-too-short  life, she made  contributions that benefited our community, State, and the world. She lived  her life as an example of living lightly  on the planet and engaged the people  and world  around  her with  grace,  humor, kindness, and respect. Everyone who worked with her admired her  style, tenacity, and sense of purpose,  along with her  sparkling  smile and  laugh.  Shannon loved living and working in  the Northwest. She reveled in the outdoors and nothing made her happier  than to participate in a competitive  run, or hike our high mountain trails.  Her death is a loss for us all. But her  spirit still resides with all of those  with whom she worked and walked the  trails, and  those who  continue  the  struggle to protect our lands and environment and create a more just and  fair world for us all.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO MARC HERSHMAN  ∑",2008
504,162,2008-03-12,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, today  I honor Marc Hershman, a professor  and former director of the University  of Washington School of Marine Affairs  and adjunct professor at the school of  law, for his exceptional public service  to our country. Since 1972, Professor  Hershman has been a valued  leader,  colleague, and mentor in the fields of  marine policy, coastal zone management, marine ports and transportation,  and law.  Mr. President,  it  is my  sad duty  today  to  report  that  Professor  Hershman passed away on Monday,  February 18. Today, I want to extend  my condolences to his entire family,  including his wife Carol, his daughter  Carla, his son Jordan, and his sister  Susan.  Professor Hershman led faculty and  students engaged in teaching and research on integrated coastal zone management, ports and transportation, living marine resource management, marine protected areas,  impacts of climate change, and other ocean issues.  He had more than 30 years of experience in the study of ocean and coastal  law and policy. In 1972, he founded the  Coastal  Management  Journal  and  served as its editor in chief. He served  as president of The Coastal Society,  was a cofounder of the Marine Affairs  and Policy Association, and was an active member of the nationwide Ocean  Governance Study Group. He was the  founder and a board member of Odyssey Maritime Discovery Center on Seattle’s central waterfront.  Over the years, Professor Hershman  was the recipient of several awards in  the marine policy field. As voted by his  peers, he was the first to receive the biennial  Orville  T. Magoon  Service  Award, which recognized his long-time  Achievement Award and was twice presented with the Distinguished Service  Award  from the Coastal Society. In  2001, at the recommendation of U.S.  House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, Professor Hershman was  selected by President George W. Bush to  serve on the U.S. Commission on Ocean  Policy.  Recently, Professor Hershman was  working on ocean policy in Washington  State. He led 25 students in preparing  ocean policy recommendations to the  Governor’s  Ocean  Policy  Working  Group. In collaboration with NOAA’s  Sea Grant Program and various State  agencies, Professor Hershman developed the groundwork for a marine policy  fellowship program  in the State  government, to be called the Hershman  Fellowship.  I extend my condolences to Professor  Hershman’s  family and  friends. His  passing is a loss not only to his family  and those who knew him but to academia and the entire field of marine  policy.∑  f  HONORING KAREN HONTZ  ∑",2008
505,162,2008-03-12,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President, I wish to  recognize  the  outstanding  service  Karen Hontz has provided to the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship in her capacity as a  detailee from the Small Business Administration, SBA. Karen came to the  Senate  last June and quickly established herself as an  invaluable asset  from her first days on the job when the  committee held a roundtable and subsequent markup on venture capital legislation. As Congress prepares to take  a short recess, Karen will begin her  transition back to the SBA, as well as  her 20th year of distinguished service  to the Federal Government. This will  certainly be SBA Administrator Preston’s gain and my and my staff’s loss.  Thank you Administrator Preston for  allowing us to work with Karen over  the last 9 months.  As I reflect on Karen’s tenure, I will  always remember how she far exceeded  all expectations, working long hours to  provide me with clear and succinct materials  about  critical  issues  facing  America’s small businesses. This was  particularly impressive given the volume of activity before the committee  and the fact that Karen was new to the  Senate. Indeed, since Karen came to  Capitol Hill, the committee held seven  oversight hearings on  issues ranging  from Government contracting, to women’s business ownership and grant programs, to the SBA’s budget. The committee also held two markups, sending  venture capital, entrepreneurial development, and contracting legislation to  the Senate floor. My staff and I could  not have navigated these committee  actions without Karen’s sage counsel  and  invaluable  insight  gained  from  years of experience at the SBA.  Not only was Karen extremely helpful  in assisting me with committee  hearings and markups, but she also  played an integral role in moving legislation on the Senate floor, a rare feat  for  a new  employee.

Over 10 community agencies  have partnered with the Coalition to infirm children, teenagers and parents about substance  abuse at this year’s event. Last year’s Drug  House Odyssey attracted over 3,000 students,  teachers, and parents, and I’m confident that  this year’s event in Cape Coral will be an even  bigger success.  For nearly 20 years, the Lee County Coalition has educated tons of thousands of students  in Southwest Florida about substance  abuse. From  school  visits  to  conferences,  community celebrations to professional counselor  training,  the Lee County Coalition has  been empowering  teenagers and  families  to  make the right choices about drug and alcohol  use. Their work  is  just a vital part of what  makes Southwest Florida a great place to live,  work and visit.  The focus of the Lee County Coalition’s annual Drug House Odyssey  is  prevention:  teaching children and  teenagers about  the  dangers of drugs and alcohol and encouraging  them  to make smart decisions about  their  health. It’s appropriate that this year’s event  will be held during National Alcohol Awareness Month. The facts are staggering: according  to  a  recent Florida Youth Substance  Abuse survey, over 35 percent of teenagers in  Lee County have reported using alcohol in the  last 30 days; nationally, the average is 16 percent.  That’s why  the good work  that  the Lee  County Coalition performs every day to help  children and teenagers make smart decisions  about drugs and alcohol is so important, and  why I ardently support their mission.  Madam Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to represent the staff and volunteers of  the Lee County Coalition  for a Drug-Free  Southwest Florida  in Congress, and  I wish  them all the best at their second annual Drug  House Odyssey.  f  HONORING DENISE JONES  HON.

509,211,2008-03-12,Mr. TOWNS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in recognition of Denise Jones who was born  and raised  in Brooklyn. Ms. Jones’ commitment  to public service originated  from her  mother and role model, Rosalie Jones, who  showed her  the benevolence of charitable  kindness to others. Her mother is currently a  retired New York City public school  teacher  who served her community for dedicated thirty-five years.  Denise Jones started her career in human  services seventeen years ago working with  MRDD at Catholic Charities as a per diem  weekend counselor. Even though she held a  printing job, she went to work at the Odyssey  House as a counselor making half the salary.  She remembers saying that the moment she  took that job, she knew It was her life’s work.  Ms. Jones has worked with  the  following  agencies:  Project Return  now  known  as  Padilla; FEGS; The Fortune Society; AHRC;  PSI Samaritan; The Partnership for the Homeless with the United Way of New York City;  Innerforce; CAMBA and Ella Place. Denise  has worked with youth at risk for incarceration,  substance  abuse MICA  patients, mentally-  challenged and  ill, ex-offenders, senior citizens, homeless, people  that suffer with HIV  and AIDS.  She has been honored  in  the New York  Nonprofit Press May 2007 issue as ‘‘Hero of  the Year’’ and by the Elliot Tomlin Foundation  with the vision award for outstanding community service. Denise Jones has marched on  Washington  to represent all  the people  that  has died  from  lack of  funding  for HIV and  AIDS research for a cure. Moreover, she is a  certified rapid HIV tester and has completed a  WORC program at Columbia University  that  addresses the delivery of vocational services  for consumers with serious mental health conditions.  Denise attends a  food and hunger conference to support world food aid once a year  and currently serves Community Board #5 as  a cabinet member. Dedicating her life to addressing social problems and assisting in reconstructing individual lives is Denise Jones’  life’s work and even now, she is working as a  project coordinator on a SPICE pilot program  to reduce disparities in childbirth through education and support services.  Madam Speaker, it is incumbent upon this  body to acknowledge Denise Jones’ achievements and her spirit of volunteerism on behalf  of the betterment of our community.  f  EMILY BUNGE  HON.

BENS has become a highly  respected national, nonpartisan organization of  senior executives dedicated to enhancing our  national security using the successful models  of the private sector.  The  innovative business-government partnerships that BENS has fostered over the past  two decades are uniquely positioned to help  meet the new challenges of the 21st century.  BENS is expanding these public-private partnerships  into all aspects of homeland security—tracking terrorists’ financial assets, securing  the Nation’s ports, and preparing State  and  local governments  to deal with  catastrophic events or terrorist attacks.  Business Executives  for National Security  has provided decades of distinguished service  to the Nation through a variety of programs.

Mr. Schwartz was assigned to the 82nd airborne, where he parachuted into Normandy in  1944 six days before the invasion. Due to his  great efforts  in  this battle, he was awarded  with the Silver Star for Gallantry in Action, the  Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Combat  Infantry  Badge, and Parachute Badge with two Bronze  Stars for his combat jumps.

514,218,2008-03-12,Mrs. BACHMANN.," Madam Speaker,  the  20th century was a  time of unprecedented,  historic gains in human rights, freedom, and  democracy. But it was also a century of unprecedented oppression, carnage and bloodshed.  Millions of families were exiled, tortured and  executed because of their faiths, their beliefs,  and their ancestries. Countless innocents were  marched to camps, slaughtered in streets, and  had their blood spilled as though it were nothing more than water. This religious and ethnic  genocide is a permanent stain on the history  of man.  From 1915  to 1923, Armenians were expelled from their 2,500-year homeland by the  Ottoman Empire. To achieve this travesty, the  Ottomans murdered 1.5 million innocent adults  and children, and raped and brutalized many  more. Yet to this day, this act of genocide has  been widely overlooked. In fact, it is officially  denied by today’s Turkish government. This is  unacceptable.  As we pledge ourselves to fighting evil and  preventing genocide in our modern world, we  must keep the past alive. For if we allow ourselves to forget the unthinkable crimes of the  20th century, mankind will be condemned to  bear witness to many more.  As we dedicate ourselves today to ending  the cycle of genocide, it’s important to realize  that education is a crucial step in preventing  future horror. Groups  like  the Armenian National Committee of America and others work  hard  to  raise  this critical awareness, and  I  pray that the monstrous horrors of yesterday  and today are all the lesson we ever need to  end the cycle of death and suffering.  f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO JIM  CAVALIERI  HON.

TED POE  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 12, 2008  ",2008
516,218,2008-03-12,Mr. POE.," Madam Speaker, police officers  dedicate their lives to keeping our streets and  communities secure. They selflessly venture  into dangerous situations every day and put  their lives on the line so that the rest of us can  sleep safely. Houston Senior Police Officer  Alphonso ‘‘Al’’ Amato, Jr., is one of those elite  individuals, who dedicated his entire career to  protecting the innocent from evil-doers.  Officer Amato enrolled in the Houston Police  Academy in 1981. His first assignment upon  graduation was with the Patrol Division of the  Houston Police Department. One of his more  notable experiences occurred when he was  testifying against an aggravated robbery defendant in the 177th District Court. While he  was testifying, the defendant jumped up and  threw his  chair at  the prosecutor. Officer  Amato  responded,  like any  top-notch officer  would, and without giving it a second thought,  jumped up and immediately took the defendant into custody. He was later prosecuted as  the trial continued.  Officer Amato has been responsible for removing dangerous outlaws from the streets of  Houston. In 1983, he began working on cases  involving  juveniles and spent  the majority of  his career working in the Juvenile Division of  the police force. While working in the Juvenile  Sex Crimes Unit, he  investigated more  than  1,000  child  exploitation  cases.  Time  and  again, he has successfully arrested the worst  kind of criminal, the one who preys on innocent children.  He has a knack for difficult cases and has  taken on the most challenging, where little or  no information has been available. Each time,  he managed to track down the criminals and  bring them to justice.  Not only does Officer Amato have fine-tuned  investigative skills, he  is also known  for his  ability to manage a crime scene. He always  kept order, even in the most difficult situations,  while questioning the involved parties.  During his many years of dedicated service,  he has  received countless commendations,  expressions of appreciation, Unit Citations, an  FBI recognition for Task Force and Sting Operations, a U.S. Marshal recognition for Gang  Task Force involvement and a Houston Fire  Department  recognition. He  is also well  respected throughout the community and among  his peers.  Officer Amato’s family has a history of service. His father served in the military. Before  becoming a  law enforcement officer, Officer  Amato served in the United States Air Force  in Vietnam for 4 years. After his time in the  military, he joined the Federal Protective Services and was there until 1977, when he left to  join  the Chicago  Police Department. He  stayed in Chicago until 1981 and then began  his career with  the Houston Police Department. This year, he is retiring from a distinguished career after more  than 26 years of  service.  According  to  his  fellow  officers, Officer  Amato served  the citizens of Houston with  pride, honor and commitment. He is known as  an upstanding citizen, a patriotic American  and a devoted law enforcement officer.  I would also like to recognize the contributions  of Al’s wife, Sandy,  and  daughter,  Raven. I commend them for persevering over  the difficult job of their loved one serving as a  law enforcement officer. Many of  the most  successful officers have a significant  family  support system behind the scenes.

519,5,2008-04-08,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," I thank my  friend, the distinguished delegate from  Guam, for yielding me the time.  I thank the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. WITTMAN) for his kind comments  as well. I am glad to be joined here by  the Chair of Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Chet Edwards.  Madam Speaker, a child’s process of  growing up  is difficult, but  imagine  what it must be like when one parent  or  even  both  parents  are  deployed  abroad as part of their duty  in our  Armed Forces.  While friends and relatives pray for  their safe return, no one feels the impact of deployment more than the children  of  servicemembers  in  combat  overseas. We are learning more about  the impact that living under this shadow of uncertainty has on our children.  The  incidence of military children  needing psychological counseling has  increased dramatically. Last year Children’s Hospital in the District of Columbia had over 1,000 visits from military children suffering from behavioral  and mental health problems. These are  just normal kids who want what any  child wants, their mothers and fathers  at home to tuck them in at night reassuring  them  everything will be all  right.  Today more than 2,300,000 Americans  demonstrate their courage and commitment every day to our Nation by  serving in our Armed Forces. Of these  men and women, most have families  subjected to frequent moves from one  installation to another,  long deployments abroad, and the fear that their  loved one serving overseas might never  come home.  b1430  Fifty percent of our troops deployed  overseas have children that are left behind. That is more than one million  children with at least one parent deployed overseas. Those figures, statistics, can too easily be ignored sometimes because they are abstract. But  here  is one that can’t be dismissed:  3,400 children have already lost a parent serving in the Armed Forces over  the past 6 years.  When I introduced this resolution 2  years ago, the number of children who  had lost a parent was 1,000 and now it  is 3,400. The Department of Defense understands that without the  families’  support, they will never have the soldiers’ full support.  In 1986, Secretary of Defense Casper  Weinberger declared this month the  ‘‘National Month  of  the Military  Child.’’ Every year  since, events at  military bases, forts and other installations across the Nation have been held  to celebrate the military family, replete with lots of lofty rhetoric but not  enough true attention to their needs.  Two bases in my own district, Fort  Belvoir and Fort Myer, hold annual  events  providing military kids  the  chance to be distracted a bit by just  being a kid with other kids in similar  situations. But the Congress needs to  step up.  Today I am glad to join with my colleagues,  particularly with my  colleagues who will speak here today, to  offer this resolution officially recognizing the month of April as the National Month of the Military Child, and  dedicating the Congress to pay more  attention  to  the  children  and  the  spouses of our soldiers.  My colleagues on the other side of  the  aisle, Representative  and  of North Carolina are  bipartisan sponsors  for this effort. I  thank them for their support and leadership.  This resolution is just a small way  that Congress can recognize the sacrifice these youngsters and their families are asked to make, but it is an opportunity to commit ourselves to doing  much more.  Specifically, the resolution joins the  Secretary of Defense in honoring military children, recognizing that they  too share the burden and are making a  great sacrifice in protecting our Nation.  I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the organization Kids  Serve Too. It is in my congressional  district, and is dedicated to the needs  of military families everywhere. It was  created by military families to support  other military families. Kids Serve Too  WALTERJONES ISSA sponsors activities and events for military children. It is represented in the  gallery  today  specifically by Tricia  Johnson and her daughters, Cat and  Claire, and her sister, Kathleen Murphy.  Madam Speaker, military  families  and their children deserve our heartfelt  appreciation for their sacrifice. Today  we honor them and their sacrifice and  thank you for bringing this resolution  to the floor.  ANNOUNCEMENTBYTHESPEAKERPROTEMPORE  ",2008

522,5,2008-04-08,Mr. EDWARDS.," Madam Speaker, I  thank the gentlelady for her time and  recognition.  Madam Speaker, I want to salute Mr.  MORANand the cosponsors of this resolution. In my book, military children  and spouses are truly the unsung heroes and heroines of our Nation’s defense. They may not put on our Nation’s uniform, but they serve every  single day and they serve with great  honor and distinction.  One cannot have a makeup day for a  parent not being present for a birthday, special occasion, for a mom or dad  not being there for a high school graduation or a college graduation. There  are no makeup days for those missed  special occasions. And as Mr. MORAN  pointed out,  in 3,400 cases, military  children have made the ultimate sacrifice of losing a mother or father in  service to our country. It is so right  that we honor these great Americans,  the military children, today with this  resolution.  As Mr. MORAN also pointed out, I  think it is also more important that we  honor them not just during the month  of April with our words and  floor  speeches,  but  every  day  and  every  month and every year with our deeds,  with effective funding, adequate funding for the Impact Aid Program that  provides  extra  Federal  funding  to  school districts with heavy concentrations of military children, with day-  care programs which this Congress last  year took the initiative on and added  $130 million worth of day-care centers  for military children throughout the  country, especially needed during a  time of war.  We worked hard on military housing  so children can live in houses they are  proud to call their homes, and their  parents are as well. And this Congress  last year took the initiative in increasing by an historic unprecedented level  funding for VA medical care so that  when those parents leave the military,  they will continue to get their military  care. I urge support of this resolution.  ",2008

528,12,2008-04-08,Mrs. CAPPS.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2464, the Wakefield Act.  This legislation reauthorizes the Emergency Medical Services  for Children  ‘‘EMSC’’ program. The EMSC program  ensures  state-of-the-art  emergency  medical care for ill or injured children  and adolescents.  Since its establishment more than 20  years ago, the EMSC program has driven major improvements in emergency  care  for children. In  fact,  injury-related  deaths  among  children  have  dropped by 40 percent over that time  period. Enormous  strides have been  made in areas such as ensuring that all  ambulances carry appropriate pediatric  supplies and equipment, and  in collecting data on pediatric emergency  care to inform future quality improvement efforts. Although much progress  has been achieved, more remains to be  done.  H.R. 2464 is an important piece of legislation that will work toward ensuring  the best emergency medical care for  children.  I would like to congratulate my colleague on the Energy and Commerce  Committee, JIMMATHESON, and commend him for his hard work and dedication to this important piece of legislation.  I encourage all of my colleagues to  join me in support of H.R. 2464.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2008
529,12,2008-04-08,Mr. DEAL of Georgia.," Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Madam Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 2464, which reauthorizes  the Emergency Medical Services  for  Children program.  It  is,  indeed, the  only Federal program dedicated to improving emergency care for children.  Since its inception in 1984, death rates  due to pediatric injury have dropped  some 40 percent.  The  program  provides  grants  to  States  to  improve  existing medical  emergency  services  systems, and  to  evaluate pediatric emergency care data  to  improve  future treatment efforts.  Many emergency centers do not have  all of the necessary supplies to treat  pediatric emergencies, despite the fact  that 18 percent of emergency department patients are children.  The legislation also increases the authorization for this program by 5 percent annually  for  the next  5 years  starting at $25 million in FY 2009. The  bill also extends by 1 year the period  that the Secretary of the Department  of Health and Human Services may  award grants under the program. The  bill had broad bipartisan support in the  committee, and I would urge its passage.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2008

531,12,2008-04-08,Mr. MATHESON.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to speak in support of H.R.  2464, the Wakefield Act. I am the lead  sponsor of this legislation, along with  Representative PETERT. KINGon the  other side of the aisle.  Today, the hospital emergency department is such a fundamental part of  our health system that it’s easy to forget that emergency medicine is a relatively  new  specialty.  Emergency  rooms were  first established  in  the  1970s as medical personnel  returned  from the Vietnam War. The skills developed to save soldiers’ lives on the  battlefield were being put to use saving  victims of car crashes and other traumas.  However, the bodies of adult soldiers  are very different from those of kids.  By the early 1980s, doctors were seeing  marked disparities  in  survival  rates  among adults and children with similar  injuries. In fact, kids had twice the  death rate in emergencies as adults.  In 1984, the Emergency Medical Services  for Children program was  first  created. This unique act has driven  fundamental  changes  in  America’s  emergency medical system. Since  it  was  established,  child  injury  death  rates have dropped 40 percent. The research that resulted from this legislation helped establish pediatric emergency medicine as its own specialty.  Program grants have provided seed  money to every State and territory to  help first responders and hospitals improve children’s emergency care. In the  mid-1980s,  emergency  personnel  received little training in caring for children. Now, thanks to this program,  paramedics can be exclusively trained,  and their ambulances are stocked with  the equipment and supplies needed by  seriously injured kids.  Nowhere has this been more critical  than in rural areas where the closest  emergency room is often many miles  from the scene of an accident. Getting  it right for these small patients in the  first critical minutes often means the  difference between life and death.  Data collection and training seminars offered under this program,  including from the Emergency Medical  Services  for Children Data Analysis  Resource Center based in my district  at the University of Utah, help ensure  that best practices are developed and  disseminated across the country.  The Emergency Medical Services for  Children program’s authorization expired in September 2005. In the summer  of 2006, the Institutes of Medicine released a report which documented the  value of this program. It noted the  gaps  that  still  remain  in providing  quality emergency care  for children.  And there is still a serious gap between  the percentage of kids who end up in  the emergency room and the percentage  of  emergency  rooms  staffed,  trained and equipped to respond appropriately. The report said this program  is ‘‘well positioned to assume a leadership role’’ in closing this gap.  I am pleased  that H.R.  2464,  the  Wakefield Act, has bipartisan and bicameral  support,  including  support  from 75 of my colleagues in the House  of Representatives. The bill is endorsed  by over 50 organizations, including the  American Academy of Pediatrics, the  American College of Emergency Physicians, the American Medical Association, the Emergency Nurses Association, and many more.

535,19,2008-04-08,Mrs. CAPPS.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate bill 845, the Safety of  Seniors Act.  Falls represent a serious health risk  for millions of older Americans. In the  United States, one of every three persons age 65 or older falls each year.  Falls are the leading cause of injury  deaths and the most common cause of  injuries and hospital admissions  for  trauma in older adults.  Senate bill 845 seeks to address the  growing problem of falling and fall-related injuries among older adults. This  legislation would direct  the Department of Health and Human Services to  oversee and support national and local  education campaigns focused on reducing falls and preventing repeated falls  among older adults. It is important to  note that the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a markup of  the House companion legislation H.R.  3701, the Keeping Seniors Safe From  Falls Act, which was  introduced by  Health Subcommittee Chairman FRANK  PALLONE. The committee amended H.R.  3701 to ensure that it was identical to  Senate  bill  845, which has  already  passed the Senate by unanimous consent. So I want to commend my good  friend FRANK for his hard  work and commitment on this important piece of legislation.  I urge my colleagues to support Senate bill 845.

We were always aware of the danger that was posed by falls, and certainly falls are one of the main causes  of injuries and hospital admissions for  senior adults.  S. 845, the Safety of Seniors Act of  2008, tries to address this danger by focusing attention on preventing  falls  among senior citizens and conducting  research to evaluate the cause of falls  among our older adults. The legislation  provides the Secretary with discretion  to  implement  a national  education  campaign, and, also, it gives him authority to evaluate the effectiveness of  community programs designed to prevent falls. It also gives the Secretary  the ability  to create demonstration  projects focused on evaluating and preventing falls in senior citizens.  I urge the adoption of this bill.

539,33,2008-04-08,Mr. BERMAN.," Madam Speaker, I rise  in strong support of this resolution and  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I would first like to  thank our Speaker, NANCYPELOSI, for  introducing this important resolution.  Speaker  commitment  to  human rights generally, and Tibetan  human rights specifically, is deep, well  established, and unwavering.  For two decades in Congress, from  her earlier stage as a junior Member to  her current position as Speaker, she  has used her powerful voice to speak on  behalf of the Tibetan people. The bipartisan delegation that she recently led  to Dharmsala to meet with the Dalai  Lama and her authorship of this resolution  demonstrate  her  continuing  dedication on the Tibetan issue. I am,  and all of us in this body should be,  grateful for her leadership.  China’s response to Tibetan protests  over the last month has been tragically  predictable. For half a century, the Tibetan people have struggled under the  repressive policies of the Chinese authorities. And sadly, the current crackdown is only the most recent example  of Beijing’s mistreatment of Tibetans.  As the world watched events unfold  inside China, we were  sickened not  only by the shock of seeing images of  Chinese authorities beating Tibetans in  the street, but also by the realization  that these are  images that we have  seen before, and fear we may see again.  It was this legacy of repression that  caused Tibetan monks to take to the  streets on March 10th to peacefully  protest Beijing’s ongoing denial of religious, cultural, and human rights for  the Tibetan people. And sadly, it was  the same legacy that caused Beijing to  respond with  excessive  force and a  propaganda  campaign  designed  to  stoke Chinese nationalism by demonizing Tibetans and their spiritual leader,  His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.  If China wishes to be viewed by the  world as a truly responsible power, it  must put an  immediate end  to  its  shortsighted  policies  towards Tibet  which are morally reprehensible, irresponsible and dangerous.  Beijing cannot credibly claim that is  seeks genuine reconciliation with the  Tibetan people when its policies force  Buddhist monks to denounce their allegiance to the Dalai Lama, deny educational and economic opportunities to  Tibetans, and threaten Tibetan culture  by encouraging an overwhelming influx  of Han Chinese migrants into Tibetan  areas. This resolution not only condemns Beijing’s crackdown on Tibetan  protesters, it also urges China to begin  to move away from its policy of repression and incitement of ethnic tensions.  The resolution calls on Beijing to  allow international monitors to assess  PELOSI the situation in Tibetan areas in China  and ensure that those injured in the  protest receive adequate medical treatment.  In addition, the resolution urges Beijing to hold direct and results-based  discussions with the Dalai Lama  in  order to come to a resolution of the Tibetan issue, one that respects Chinese  territorial  integrity and sovereignty,  but at the same time provides genuine  religious and cultural autonomy for Tibetans.  The resolution instructs the Department of State to reconsider its decision  not to include China among the countries with  the worst human  rights  records  in  the  Department’s  2007  Human Rights Report.  Madam Speaker, at this point, once  again, I would like to thank Speaker  for introducing this important  resolution, which I strongly support,  and ask my colleagues to do the same.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong and  enthusiastic support of this resolution  which forcefully criticizes the current  bloody crackdown that is taking place  in Tibet. This resolution also condemns  Beijing’s almost six decades of suppression of the religious, linguistic, economic, and cultural rights of the people of Tibet.  It was my  great  honor, Madam  Speaker, to sponsor legislation which  resulted in the awarding of the Congressional Gold Medal,  the  highest  honor that we can bestow in the United  States Congress, to His Holiness, the  Dalai Lama,  last October. My  late  friend and colleague from across the  aisle, Congressman Tom Lantos, and I  worked together to ensure that His Holiness received the official recognition  that he so richly deserves.  The Dalai Lama, who is also a Nobel  Peace Prize recipient, has won the admiration of all of us, not only for his  spiritual guidance, but also  for his  principled stand upholding the human  rights of the captive people of Tibet.  Beijing’s cynical and crass campaign  to denigrate His Holiness both inside  and outside of Tibet has drawn the  anger of both the Dalai Lama’s  followers, as well as people of good will  throughout  the  globe.  Beijing  has  called His Holiness ‘‘a splittist’’ and ‘‘a  wolf in monk’s clothing.’’ The Chinese  Embassy even recently sent out a computer link to offices here on Capitol  Hill  ludicrously comparing His Holiness to Nazis.  The people of Tibet can no longer silently bear these continued insults directed at their spiritual leader, a man  respected as an advocate of peace, of  compassion, and good will. A boiling  point was reached on March 10th, the  anniversary of  the  1959 uprising  in  Tibet and  subsequent  flight of  the  Dalai Lama into exile in India. When  demonstrators broke out in Lhasa, Beijing responded with an iron fist. In implementing a bloody crackdown, Beijing  ignored  its past pledge  to  the  International Olympic Committee to  improve the human rights situation in  China prior to this summer’s Olympics.  Chinese authorities even denied foreign  diplomats and journalists all access to  Tibet.  With  increasing numbers of American tourists traveling to Tibet every  year, the United States has a legitimate interest in having diplomatic access to Tibet for consular services. But  there should be no further openings of  more Chinese consulates in the United  States until China stops its repression  of religious and ethnic minorities and  stops violating the fundamental human  rights of its own citizens.  The crackdown continued until April  3, when Chinese troops  fired  into a  peaceful crowd of demonstrators outside a Tibetan temple  in southwest  China. The crowd had been protesting  the arrest of  two monks who were  found in possession of photographs of  the Dalai Lama. Eight were killed, including members of the Buddhist clergy.  But the Chinese regime has not only  been responsible for shedding innocent  Tibetan blood, in Darfur, in Burma, in  North Korea, and inside China itself,  bloody repression continues unabated.  b1930  This lack of liberty will further diminish the light of the Olympic torch.  The progression of  that  torch  from  London and Paris to San Francisco has  become a  focal point  for those who  would raise their voices concerning the  immense human rights abuses of the  Chinese regime.  What has begun  in Tibet will not  stay in Tibet. Already there are reports  of unrest among the Uyghur minority  as well. Beijing’s continued repression  and denial of human rights will become  the chief focal point of international  attention in the summer of the Beijing  Olympics. And, Madam Speaker, if the  present repression continues, the Beijing games will  indeed become  the  ‘‘Genocide Olympics.’’  I urge all of my colleagues to join in  vigorous approval and support for this  resolution.  With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve  the balance of my time, and  I ask  unanimous  consent  that my  good  friend the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. SMITH) be allowed to manage the  remainder of our time.

544,40,2008-04-08,Mr. FARR.," Madam Speaker, in mid-March,  the Chinese government conducted a bloody  crackdown, grossly violating the human rights  of the peaceful protestors in Tibet.  The protest by the Tibetans touched a nerve  and rapidly spread beyond the capital city of  Lhasa into other areas of Tibet and around the  world. The peaceful protest drew a violent and  disproportionate  reaction  from  the Chinese  government who sought to tamp down the Tibetan desire for autonomy and self-determination. Not only did  the Chinese government  react with  terrible  force upon  the protesters,  the authorities also tried to discredit the Dalai  Lama and his movement for a free Tibet.  The Dalai Lama is as determined and committed to nonviolence as he is to seeing the  emergence of a peaceful, prosperous, autonomous and self-determined Tibet. The brutal  crackdown that seeks to derail the inevitable  movement toward a free Tibet resulted in the  deaths of more than 100 Tibetans and caused  a great deal of social upheaval.  While we live a safe distance away from the  struggle, comfortably ensconced  in a  liberal  democratic society, we cannot act as though  we do not have a role to play to support the  Dalai Lama. We do.  I  am  enormously  grateful  to  Speaker  PELOSI, who has offered this House resolution  which calls upon  the Chinese  to end  this  crackdown. This  violent  reaction  is  shortsighted and unproductive and, furthermore, it’s  not  the  long-term solution  that  respects  the  human rights and dignity of every Tibetan.  Rather, the Chinese Government must enter  into a serious, substantive negotiation directly  with  the Dalai Lama and must allow  independent monitors into Tibet. Only then will we  be on the path toward a solution to this crisis.  Furthermore, I join Speaker PELOSIand other  supporters of a free Tibet, to ask for the immediate release of all Tibetans who were arrested for non-violent protest.  I am pleased  this evening  to express my  support for the struggle toward a free Tibet,  and I would encourage all my colleagues to  join me by supporting  this  important House  resolution.  ROHRABACHER ",2008
545,40,2008-04-08,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today  in support of House Resolution 1077,  calling on the Government of the People’s Republic of China to end its crackdown in Tibet.  The resolution also calls for the Chinese Government to enter into a substantive dialogue  with His Holiness the Dalai Lama to find a negotiated solution that respects the distinctive  language, culture, religious identity, and fundamental freedoms of all Tibetans.  The Dalai Lama has stated his willingness  to accept cultural autonomy  for Tibet under  the Chinese Constitution. He has also been  willing to negotiate with Beijing and has advanced a number of very moderate proposals  regarding Tibet’s  future  status. The Communist regime, however, has only met this attempt at accommodation with stiff opposition,  and is currently instigating yet another crackdown in the lead up to the Beijing Olympics.  To date, Congress has stood strongly by the  Tibetan people as  they bravely struggle  for  their rights:  In 1991, Congress passed a resolution stating that Tibet is an occupied country.  In  September  of  2007,  Representative  introduced House Resolution  610, expressing  the sense of  the House of  Representatives  that  the United States Government should take immediate steps to boycott the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing in  August 2008 unless the Chinese regime stops  engaging  in  serious human  rights abuses  against its citizens and stops supporting serious human rights abuses by the Governments  of Sudan, Burma, and North Korea against  their citizens. I wholeheartedly support and cosponsor this measure.  Congressman DANAROHRABACHERand I recently formed the Tibet Caucus and already  have 8 new members.  Congress awarded the Dalai Lama the Congressional Gold Medal.  We cannot stand silently by and watch as  another wave  of  brutality  and  oppression  sweeps across the country by the Beijing regime. Congress must continue to stand by the  Tibetan people and uphold  their  rights as  human beings. I urge every Member of Congress to join the Tibetan Caucus, vote ‘‘yes’’  for House Resolution 1077, and urge  the  President of the United States to issue an executive order boycotting the Beijing Olympics  and uphold the rights of the Tibetan people to  ensure their voice is not silenced.  ",2008
546,40,2008-04-08,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Madam Speaker, I rise in  strong support of H. Res. 1077 and I want to  thank  the Speaker  of  the House, NANCY  PELOSI, for her leadership and commitment to  the people of Tibet. For many years, in both  words and deeds, she has stood by the people of Tibet, and called  for  the respect and  support of their dignity, culture, heritage, and  religion. And I am proud to be a cosponsor of  this legislation.  Madam Speaker, I believe Tibet is one of  the most serious human  rights and political  freedom issues of our time.  The violent  response by Chinese military  forces to peaceful protests that began in the  Tibetan capital on March 11th is horrifying. I  believe the United States and the international  community must convey a strong condemnation of these acts, an accounting by China on  the welfare and whereabouts of the many detained Buddhist monks and other Tibetan citizens who have been arrested, and  facilitate  access by international human rights monitors  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:58 Jun 26, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 J:\CRONLINE€8BA~2€8NE~2\H08AP8.REC H08AP 8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008
547,47,2008-04-08,Mr. GINGREY.," The gentlewoman remembers,  I think we all remember,  hopefully, that last year the Congress  asked for the Iraqi government to meet  certain benchmarks. And this  is exactly what Representative BLACKBURN  is talking about now in regard to certain laws that their parliament would  need to pass. It was sort of like a, you  know, we’ll only continue to help you  if you promise by a date certain that  you will have provincial elections, that  you will pass a de-Ba’athification law,  which  essentially meant  that  those  Sunnis, those brave soldiers that we  are calling now and referring to as sons  of Iraq, and as I say, mostly Sunnis,  that they would have an opportunity to  be included, maybe to be officially a  part of the Iraqi security force.  So the government had to get over  the fact that there was this rivalry, if  you will, between the Shias in the majority and the Sunnis in the minority  and the Sunnis led by the brutal dictator. Saddam Hussein had suppressed,  oppressed, murdered so many of the  Shias for so many years of his reign of  terror that it’s difficult to all of a sudden reach out an olive branch, but  that’s what we asked them to do in regard to de-Ba’athification, and I think  it’s important. And also asking them  to share the oil revenue with all parts  of the country, not just where the oil is  found in the oil-rich Kurdish region but  also in the west where there’s very little oil and in the south as you have  sharing.  b2115  So that’s what the gentlewoman is  talking about, and I yield back to her.  I just wanted to say that, and I’ll  make this one last point before I yield  back,  if  the gentlewoman will bear  with me just a second. It was said that  those benchmarks needed to be met before we would provide additional troops  and security and help stabilize things  on the ground. But you couldn’t have  an effective parliament, an effective  government until the people on the  ground, in the towns, in the villages  felt that their new government that  they voted for could protect them, that  had  the  ability,  had  the military  strength, had the training that they  felt secure and that they could go forward with this government. So the provision of security on the ground was  first and foremost, and that’s what the  surge was all about.  I yield back to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee.  ",2008
548,47,2008-04-08,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," I thank the gentleman for yielding. And he’s exactly  right. Security on the ground, a secure  and stable environment. And that is  what the counterinsurgency strategy  has been about, and the results that it  has yielded.  As we have  just discussed,  indeed,  and as Americans know well, we had a  surge from our troops. The Iraqis also  carried out their surge, and what it has  yielded is an environment where not  only we saw the military progress, but  also where political progress can take  place. And there are some wonderful  lessons learned here.  I think that one of those, when we  are in Iraq visiting with our troops and  working with some of the Iraqis and  helping to mentor some of the women  that we have mentored over there, one  of the things they will tell you is, we  are so glad that you have not left us.  Thank you for not leaving us. We know  people are frustrated. We know there  are no guarantees. But we also know  that it is important that we keep at it.  It’s not going to happen overnight. And  thank you, thank you for not leaving.  We fear what would happen if you left.  And they are, as the gentleman from  Georgia was saying, Mr. Speaker, they  are  seeing  progress. The  Iraq  parliament is seeing progress. And as the  gentleman just listed some things, and  let me touch on them again, a pension  law for regime officials, that has happened. De-Ba’athification reform, that  has been carried out. An amnesty law,  provincial election  laws. And as he  said, the sharing, the national government now sharing oil revenues with the  provinces, something that a year ago  many people said, it will never happen.  But, here we are, and yes, indeed, it all  is beginning to take place.  I yield back to the gentleman from  Georgia.  ",2008
549,47,2008-04-08,Mr. GINGREY.," Well, again, I thank  the gentlewoman from Tennessee. And  I would like to reemphasize the statistics that she was talking about that we  said at the outset, Mr. Speaker, of this  hour that we’re going to talk about  what a difference that a year makes  and present those statistics, how particularly violence has decreased. And  Representative BLACKBURNhas already  talked about that.  But I would ask my colleagues to reference this first slide in regard to its  title. This is a little difficult to see in  the back of the Chamber, but ‘‘Civilian  Deaths.’’ And it is amazing, if you look  at this top line going back to January  of 2006 and then coming forward almost  to present day, March of 2008, and you  see that about the time of the surge,  that peaked the civilian deaths. We’re  talking about on an almost monthly  basis, 4,000 civilian deaths. I think if  you follow the line down, that would be  about January or February of 2007. And  in March of 2008, at the far side of the  chart, you’re looking at a number just  slightly over 600. So to go from almost  4,000 deaths to 600. And I have some additional charts to basically show the  same thing, again, the statistics that  we promised to present at the outset of  the hour, to show you what a difference  a year makes.  And this slide, my colleagues, says  ‘‘High Profile Attacks,’’ basically explosions. And the blue line is the total.  The next, I guess you would call that  the brown graph, is car bombs. The red  is suicide car bombs. And then on the  bottom is suicide deaths. But this is a  total. And  that’s where  the  rubber  meets the road in these statistics.  And again, about a year ago, you  were talking about attacks occurring  in the range of 125 a day. And until this  recent outbreak in Basra, they were  down to about 40 a day. So, again, as I  said at the outset, by any measure, by  any parameter, any metric you want to  take, the success of the surge is obvious.  ",2008
550,47,2008-04-08,Mrs. BLACKBURN., If the gentleman  will yield.  ,2008
551,47,2008-04-08,Mr. GINGREY.," I will be glad to yield.  I will make one further point, and then  I will yield to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee.  These success stories you don’t see  on the nightly news. I think it was Ann  Murray that sang a very famous hit a  number of years ago, and I think the  title of that was ‘‘A Little Good News  Today.’’ You don’t hear about good  news because, by definition,  it’s not  news. It’s only mayhem and violence  and killings and rapes and people putting their children in the trunk of a car  and leaving them there for a day as a  disciplinary action for some minor infraction. These are the kind of things  that are on the front pages of our newspapers and on the 24-hour news service.  They only talk about it when there’s  violence. Unfortunately,  there’s not  much credit given  to a  little good  news, in fact, a lot of good news.  I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee.  ",2008
552,47,2008-04-08,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," I thank the gentleman for yielding.  And he has shown us some great  charts, civilian deaths, the coalition  data, the high profile attacks with the  suicide car bombings, the car bombs,  the  suicide  attacks,  the  weapons  caches that are found and cleared. And  when you look at the fact that we are  finding many more weapons  caches  than we were and when you look at the  fact that the attacks are down and the  deaths are down, you have to ask, how  did this happen? And the way it has  happened is our men and women in uniform, and God bless them all, and I  think about my constituents from Fort  Campbell who are deployed right now,  who are in both Iraq and Afghanistan,  but the men and women in uniform  who are taking the lead and who are  gaining the trust of the Iraqi people  and of the Iraqi forces and of the Sons  of Iraq. And it is our men and women  in uniform, as they gain this trust, and  as the Iraqis know we’re not going to  quit, they are telling them, this  is  what I know, this is where you go to  root out this evil person, this is where  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:58 Jun 26, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€8BA~2€8NE~2\H08AP8.REC H08AP 8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008

676,82,2008-04-08,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Today, President  Bush submitted the Colombia Trade  Promotion Trade Agreement  Implementing Act to Congress. This bill, as  the title implies, would implement our  pending trade agreement with Colombia, which the administration and Colombia signed in November 2006.  This is an important agreement that  deserves our support. Some of the economic reasons for supporting this trade  agreement are that the economic rationale is obvious. In my view, the economic rationale is undeniable. That is  because Colombia is a beneficiary of  two of our unilateral trade preference  programs: The Andean Trade Preference Act, and the Generalized System of Preferences.  Now, all this means is Colombia already gets duty-free access  to U.S.  markets for the vast majority of its  goods. Now, meanwhile, less than 3 percent of our exports to Colombia, and  not a single U.S. agricultural export,  receives duty-free treatment from Colombia. Our exporters face Colombian  tariffs as high as 35 percent for nonagricultural goods and even much higher tariffs for agricultural goods.  The  Colombian  trade  agreement  would thus eliminate this disparity or,  as we like to say so often, level the  playing field for American exporters,  thus  giving American workers  the  same  access  to Colombian markets  that their workers get to the U.S. markets; in other words, being fair, leveling the playing field.  Now, the U.S.  International Trade  Commission has  found  that  leveling  the playing field will increase our exports to Colombia by $1.1 billion per  year. That is as a result of eliminating  the duty on goods. That means real  benefits  for American  farmers,  for  American manufacturers, for American  service suppliers.  One of the chief benefits is it will  help keep  good-paying  jobs  in  the  United States. So I would ask my colleagues and the American people to  think  about  this whole  proposition  about the Colombian Free Trade Agreement this way: Either we maintain the  status quo or we create new opportunities for American exporters.  At its heart, that is what this debate  is all about. Last year, exports accounted for more than 40 percent of our  total economic growth. We should be  doing everything we can do to grow our  exports even further. That is what we  did  last December when the Senate  voted by this wide margin of 77 to 18 in  favor of a free-trade agreement with  Peru.  The Colombian trade agreement  is  very much like this Peru agreement,  and the Colombian market is bigger  than the Peru agreement. If it makes  sense to approve the Peru agreement,  it makes even more sense to approve  the agreement with the country of Colombia.  Economic considerations are not the  only reason to support the Colombian  agreement. I say this because too often  we measure trade entirely in economic  terms. But there are a lot of ways to  measure trade other than  in dollars  and cents. Because in this instance and  in so many instances, trade agreements  are about an important national security priority.  There is one very specific reason for  doing this with Colombia. Because as  my Senate colleagues know, Colombia  is a strong Democratic ally in a very  dangerous  neighborhood. For many  years, it has been under assault from  the FARC, a group of narcoterrorists  fighting to overthrow the democratically elected Government in Colombia. It is increasingly under pressure,  as Colombia is, from Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez. You have seen a lot  of this in the news in the last month.  President Chavez  of Venezuela  is  using oil wealth to divide Latin America. He is trying to lure allies to his  Socialist vision and, most importantly,  to promote his anti-U.S. agenda. He is  fiercely opposed in this process to anything that Colombia’s President Uribe  does  in cooperating with the United  States or even having a friendship with  the United States.  There have been troubling reports  that President Chavez may be working  with the FARC. Last month, he tried  to create a diplomatic crisis over a border incident that did not even involve  Venezuela. He took the side of the  FARC against the Colombian Government. At a challenging time such as  this, the United States has a responsibility  to  provide  strong,  principled  leadership. Our agreeing to the Colombian Free Trade Agreement is one way  of showing strong, principled  leadership in support of a friend in South  America.  We must stand by our allies. We must  help to promote economic stability, security and, most importantly, the rule  of  law, whether  it  is  in  trade  or  nontrade areas. President Uribe has  made it clear that one of the most important steps we can take in this regard is then to help him, through our  implementation  of  the  Colombian  Trade Agreement that levels the playing  field  for America,  for America’s  manufacturers, service providers, so we  can get our products into Colombia on  the same basis as Colombian farmers or  manufacturers or whatever have been  able to get their products  into this  country without duty.  Our  leaders  in Latin America are  watching us in this process. They see  our approach to Colombia as a proxy  for the overall attitude toward Latin  America.

Had  I  been present, I would have voted as follows:  On rollcall No. 154, on ordering the previous  question on H. Res. 1605, providing  for  the  consideration of H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos  and Henry J.

I want to thank Chairmen REYESand  CONYERSand for the immense time and effort  they both have put  into  this  legislation, and  also thank Speaker PELOSI for her efforts to  negotiate with the Senate to work out the differences between the two bills.  As Congress works to reauthorize and improve our foreign intelligence surveillance, it is  imperative to remember that the United States  has enemies abroad who wish to do us harm.  In  these delicate negotiations, we must be  sure to protect the civil liberties of the American people and keep our Constitution in tact,  while at the same time giving our intelligence  community all  the critical  tools necessary  to  keep us safe. I believe that with an updated  bill approved by the House, we can work out  our honest differences and come up with a  good bill that keeps the American people safe  and protects our civil rights.  While the House passed bill is a step in the  right direction, I believe certain additional provisions should be included in final compromise  legislation. It is critical that any FISA legislation works to encourage compliance with our  private sector partners in the ultimate goal of  keeping America and her people secure. As  such,  targeted  immunity  for  telecom carriers  that allegedly participated in anti-terrorism surveillance programs may become of vital importance.  I am confident that as Congress moves forward  in negotiating  sensible and effective  FISA legislation, we will continue to work toward the right balance that protects the Constitutional rights of all Americans, while also  authorizing the measures necessary to keep  the United States safe.  f  HONORING PAUL CRAWFORD  HON.

Paul, who  is  the  founder of  the Cumberland Valley Township  Historical Society  in Bedford County, will he  honored with this distinguished award at the  Bedford County Historical Society’s annual  history banquet in April.  As founder of the Cumberland Valley Township Historical Society, Paul has dedicated  much of his life to researching and preserving  the history of his community. He serves as a  true leader in the community and the Society,  directing many of the projects and events of  the organization. Paul is a constant presence  in the Cumberland Valley region, active in various community events and projects that support and promote the region.  Paul’s role as a historian cannot be denied.  He is consistently found pouring over historical  documents  and  photographs,  researching,  documenting, and cataloging the history of the  Cumberland Valley Township so  that others  can learn and remember the stories of those  that came before them. Paul is a great leader  in the community, and Bedford County is lucky  to have such a dedicated  individual working  for the benefit of the entire community.  Paul Crawford’s dedication to the preservation of his community’s history  is admirable,  and we can hope that others will follow in his  footsteps and view our history with the same  pride and honor as he has so clearly done.  f  TRIBUTE TO RITA AND JACK  SINDER  HON. HOWARD L. BERMAN  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 8, 2008  ",2008
682,124,2008-04-08,Mr. BERMAN.," Madam Speaker, I rise to pay  tribute  to  two dear  friends, Rita and Jack  Sinder, who are being honored by Valley Beth  Shalom’s 60th Birthday of the State of Israel  Dinner Celebration. They are being recognized  for their lifetime of commitment to Israel, the  Jewish  people,  and  Valley  Beth  Shalom  (VBS).  In 1967, Rita and Jack made their first trip  to  Israel  just prior  to  the Six-Day War. The  outbreak of hostilities forced their early departure on the eve of the war. The impact of their  experience motivated  them  to mobilize  the  American Jewish community on  Israel’s behalf.  Their dedication to Israel, however, began  long before the State of Israel was created.  Born in Vienna, Rita was immersed in Judaism as a young child. During WWII, when Hitler invaded Austria, Rita’s father was shipped  to Poland. He  fortunately escaped and her  mother managed  to  get  herself  and  her  daughters out of Austria. Rita was sent to London on Kindertransport and was not reunited  with her family until the war ended. The determination, positive attitude,  tremendous  resilience, and adaptability that helped her survive  still guide her life today. Rita’s family was miraculously reunited in America, settling in Los  Angeles where Rita attended Belmont High  School and graduated from USC with a degree in Business Administration.  Jack, raised in the Orthodox tradition by his  father, a prominent Rabbi in Michigan, earned  a degree  in Mechanical Engineering  from  Michigan State. He worked for a machine tool  company that supplied parts to the big three  automakers. He was asked by an associate to  help send machine tools to the Jewish fighters  in  Israel, and  together with his  friends, he  shipped  tools which ultimately helped  in  the  creation of the Israeli aircraft industry and the  Israeli Air Force.  Rita and Jack have been an integral force in  the Jewish Community, living up to the motto,  ‘‘Give of yourself first and only then ask others  to join you.’’ They have generously contributed  their time and resources to VBS, the Jewish  Federation,  Israel Bonds, AIPAC and many  other worthy organizations. They endowed the  Midrasha Program at  the VBS, where Jack  formerly was a member of the Board of Directors and currently serves on  the Board of  Trustees and  the Steering Committee. Rita  has chaired many special events at VBS. She  is past president of the San Fernando Valley  Women’s Division of  Israel Bonds and  the  Golda Meir Club, an active member of AIPAC  serving on its National Executive Board, and is  past president and member of the Executive  Board of the Women’s Alliance of Israel. Rita  and Jack are founding members of the American Jewish University’s Wagner Program, university  patrons  and  also  patrons  of  the  Wiesenthal Center.  Rita and Jack work together in their business, Jasin Co., he as a real estate developer  and she as a real estate broker and property  manager. They are the proud parents of Sherri  and Alan and adore their three grandchildren.  Rita and Jack’s greatest joys are being with  family and friends, boating and traveling.  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting  Rita and Jack Sinder who have devoted their  lives to working for the survival of the Jewish  people and the State of Israel.  f  NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH WEEK  HON.

683,124,2008-04-08,Mr. BOSWELL.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today in recognition of National Public Health  Week (NPHW), April 7–13, a week to focus on  issues facing the public health and find ways  to improve the health of all. This year NPHW  focuses on how climate change  is affecting  the health of Americans and people around  the world.  The impact of global climate change on our  planet and the role we have played in speeding its progress is becoming increasingly self-  evident. The work of groups like the American  Public Health Association and committed individuals, such as  former Vice President Al  Gore, have created a heightened awareness  of what is one of the most important issues of  the coming century. This heightened state of  public awareness has led to calls across the  country for a new emphasis on reducing the  amount of greenhouse gases that are expelled  into the atmosphere by finding new, cleaner  sources of energy, reducing our consumption  of natural  resources, and using energy-efficient products.  In my home State of Iowa we are working  hard to find new and innovative ways to reduce  the amount of greenhouse gases produced. It gives me great pride to say that a recent study by the American Wind Energy Association  found  that  Iowa ranked  first  in  the  Nation  in  the percentage of wind-generated  electricity created in the State, and fourth in  total wind electricity generation.  The Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council,  ICCAC, created less than a year ago in April  2007, is charged with finding ways for Iowa to  combat climate change by becoming more energy efficient and independent. The ICCAC is  right now creating plans for the reduction of  greenhouse gases statewide with target goals  of 50 percent to 90 percent by 2050.  In February of this year Governor Chet Culver signed Executive Order Six, establishing a  new ‘‘green government’’ initiative.

This  important  legislation will  increase Medicaid  Disproportionate Share Hospital  (DSH) payments  to Oklahoma and 19 other  low DSH  States and bring Oklahoma’s hospitals on  equal  footing with other States who receive  their fair share of DSH funds.  With Oklahoma having  the  fourth highest  rate of uninsured in the Nation, it is critical that  Oklahoma hospitals receive a fair distribution  of DSH funds we need to care for our indigent  population. This  legislation will  increase  the  rate that unused DSH funds are reimbursed to  these low DSH States from the current rate of  16 percent  to 19.5 percent  for  the next 5  years. The Medicare Modernization Act of  2003 statutorily defined low DSH States and  provided these States with 16 percent funding  increases each year for the last 5 fiscal years.  In total, there are 20 States that have lower  DSH allotments,  including: Alaska, Arizona,  Arkansas, Delaware, Florida,  Idaho,  Iowa,  Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The 16 percent rate expires at the end of this fiscal year, so it is critical that we increase this percentage so that  our hospitals do not feel the financial strain of  providing health care services to the indigent.  Under  the 19.5 percent  increases, Oklahoma will receive an additional $49 million in  Federal  funds which, when matched by  the  State, could amount to $75 million over the 5-  year period to allocate to Oklahoma hospitals  to help offset  the costs of uncompensated  care. Oklahoma hospitals provided $325 million  in uncompensated care costs  in 2006.  H.R. 5721 will help decrease uncompensated  care costs for Oklahoma hospitals and ensure  fairness among all 50 States by equitably distributing unused DSH Funds.  Since this bill is being solely funded through  unused Federal DSH allotments, the funding  source of the bill merely utilizes funds that are  currently being returned to the Federal Government by other States that do not use all of  their DSH  funds. These unused  funds currently are not being used  toward any other  health care related programs.  Another important issue which needs to be  addressed  is access  to quality, affordable  health care, especially within our Nation’s indigent population. Indigent patients in Oklahoma  and our Nation face a significant number of  unmet health care needs. These patients have  difficulty accessing primary, diagnostic and  specialty care and rely on hospital emergency  rooms as  their primary entry  into  the health  care system. The price of treating the indigent  at hospital emergency  rooms  is astounding  compared to care found in a primary care setting. H.R. 5721 will help bring down  these  costs and save taxpayer dollars in the process.  My legislation will create an innovative new  grant program  through  the Department of  Health and Human Services to help our Nation’s health care providers fund health access  networks, which will get low income and uninsured patients who need basic medical care  out of emergency rooms and into primary care  facilities. These networks would be required to  provide high quality primary, outpatient, inpatient and specialty care to uninsured and other  medically vulnerable populations in an effort to  reduce the costs of treating these individuals  for hospitals and taxpayers alike.  According  to a 2005 study by  the Lewin  Group on Strategic Planning  for Safety-Net  Services, Tulsa, like many communities, faces  many challenges in its delivery, financing and  organization that limit its ability to successfully  meet the needs of safety-net populations. To  give an example, the price of treating the indigent at our hospital emergency rooms is astounding compared  to  the cost of  treating  someone  in a primary care setting. To give  you an example: the Oklahoma Health Care  Authority  recently  found  that  the cost of a  claim for asthma treatment in a primary care  setting was $34.12 per claim, while the average cost for the same asthma treatment in an  emergency  room  setting was  $61.20  per  claim. While some of these claims may have  been emergencies, it is clear that treatment in  an outpatient setting  is significantly  less, almost  two  times  less,  than  treatment  in an  emergency room. Without  these networks  in  place,  the majority of Oklahoma’s uninsured  will  continue  to  go  without  a  primary  healthcare provider.  Lastly, my bill also changes the grandfather  clause for the mandatory requirement related  to hospitals providing nonemergency obstetric  services which are located in low DSH States.  The new grandfather clause will be the date  this law becomes enacted. The purpose of this  change is to remove a constraint imposed on  low DSH States whose rural hospitals stopped  providing nonemergency obstetrics during the  1990s and early 2000s due to rising liability insurance costs. The change is intended to encourage low DSH States to change their approach to funding more hospitals through the  DSH program. Should my legislation become  law, 16 additional Oklahoma hospitals will be  able to qualify for DSH funds.  I am pleased  to have  the support of  the  Oklahoma Health Care Authority,  the Oklahoma Hospital Association and advocates for  Tulsa health-plexes for the Strengthening the  Safety Net Act of 2008. As a member of the  House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee  on Health,  I am  looking  forward  to working  with my colleagues on the committee to see  this legislation become law.  f  RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN JEREMY D.

Anzevino as  a recipient of a Bronze Star Medal for heroic  achievement during combat operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Bronze  Star is the fourth highest award that the Department of Defense gives  for bravery. heroism, and meritorious service.  Captain Anzevino earned  the Bronze Star  while he was commander of Co. L, 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division of  the  II Marine Expeditionary Force  in  Iraq. He was team chief and staff maneuver  advisor  for  the Military Transition Team. 1st  Battalion. 3rd Brigade, 1st Iraqi Army Division,  from January to July 2007.  His award citation states,  ‘‘Anzevino provided advice and assistance to Iraqi leaders of  1st Battalion during counterinsurgency operations, which led to the elimination of numerous insurgents.’’  Captain Anzevino’s bravery goes above and  beyond what we are asked of as citizens of  this country. His heroism illustrates the compassion of  Iowans; willing  to  risk  their own  lives for their country. For this I offer him my  utmost respect, congratulations, and thanks.  I commend Captain Jeremy Anzevino’s courageousness and service to our great nation.  I am honored to represent Captain Anzevino  in the United States Congress and I wish him  the best in his future service to our country.  f  A  PROCLAMATION  HONORING  JAMES VAN VOORHIS FOR WINNING  THE  BOYS’  DIVISION  II  STATE BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP  HON.

688,27,2008-04-21,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Madam President,  today  I  commemorate  the  life and  work of Aldo Leopold, who is remembered as a pivotal figure in the conservation movement of the early 20th  century. Today marks the 60th anniversary of Leopold’s death, and it offers us an opportunity to reflect on the  lasting contributions that he made to  our country.  Born in Burlington, IA, in 1887, Aldo  Leopold was raised near the Mississippi  River  surrounded by a vibrant ecosystem that sustained abundant waterfowl  and  other wildlife. Early  on,  Leopold developed a keen interest in  the natural world, devoting much of  his spare time to cataloguing his observations. Graduating from Yale in 1909  with a master of forestry degree, he  soon  joined the nascent U.S. Forest  Service with his first field assignments  in the American Southwest. His career  with the Forest Service brought him to  my home State of New Mexico, spending time working in the Gila National  Forest  in the southwest part of the  State  before  subsequently moving  north to the Carson National Forest,  where he reached the post of forest supervisor on the Carson.  Leopold  felt that preservation had  been neglected on the national forests.  He  foresaw  the  importance of preserving  the biological diversity and  natural systems giving way to development. He argued against the proposed  expansion of a road system into the  back country of the Gila National Forest. And in Albuquerque in 1922, he proposed instead that a large area be left  roadless and preserved for wilderness  recreation. He defined this new concept  as  ‘‘a continuous stretch of country  preserved in its natural state, open to  lawful hunting and fishing, big enough  to absorb a 2 week’s pack trip, and  kept devoid of roads, artificial trails,  cottages, or other works of man.’’ On  June 3, 1924, the Forest Service gave its  final approval and designated 755,000  acres of national forest land as the Gila  Wilderness. This  unprecedented  act  took place 40 years prior to passage of  the Wilderness Act and was the first  such designation in the world.  Leopold once wrote that ‘‘a thing is  right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community.’’ Today the Gila Wilderness is inhabited by bear, wolf, deer,  elk, beaver, bobcat, mountain lion, antelope, and wild turkey. It is a favorite  destination  for hikers, backpackers,  hunters  and  anglers who  enjoy  its  miles of fishing streams. The Gila Wilderness contains the cliff dwellings of  the ancient Mogollon civilization as  well  as  the  campsites  and  battlegrounds of the Apache and the U.S.  Cavalry. In fact, John Murray wrote in  his book, ‘‘The Gila Wilderness: A Hiking Guide,’’ that ‘‘no other wilderness  area in the Southwest so much embodies and reflects this national history and natural philosophy as does  the Gila.’’  Aldo Leopold’s concept of wilderness  evolved over time and heavily influenced policy makers and the growing  conservation  community. He wrote,  ‘‘Wilderness is the raw material out of  which man has hammered the artifact  called civilization. . . . To the laborer  in the sweat of his labor, the raw stuff  on his anvil is an adversary to be conquered. So was wilderness an adversary  to the pioneer. But to the laborer in  repose, able for the moment to cast a  philosophical eye on his world, that  same raw stuff is something to be loved  and cherished, because it gives definition and meaning to his life.’’ One person who  shared  that definition and  meaning with Aldo Leopold was former  New Mexico Senator Clinton P. Anderson. In fact, due in large part to the  conversations he had with Leopold 40  years earlier, Senator Anderson led the  effort in Congress to pass the Wilderness Act of 1964.  On April 21, 1948, at the age of 61,  Aldo Leopold died of a heart attack  while helping his neighbors  fight a  brush fire near his farm. Just 1 week  earlier, Leopold had received word that  his book of essays had finally found a  publisher. Published over a year after  his death, ‘‘A Sand County Almanac’’  remains one of Aldo Leopold’s greatest  legacies  to  the  conservation movement.  Leopold laments in ‘‘A Sand County  Almanac’’ that progress in conservation is slow—a fact that hasn’t changed  much in modern times. ‘‘Despite nearly  a century of propaganda,’’ he wrote,  ‘‘conservation still proceeds at a snail’s  pace; progress still consists largely of  letterhead pieties and convention oratory. On the back forty we still slip  two steps backward for each forward  stride.’’ On this anniversary of Aldo  Leopold death, I am pleased that the  Senate is once again making progress  on protecting wilderness, through bills  such as the Wild Sky Wilderness Act  that passed last week, and upcoming  bills  that  are making  their  way  through the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources. These bills are effective steps to preserve our heritage  for future generations, consistent with  the values for which Leopold advocated  so eloquently during his life, and I am  pleased that so many Senators, on both  sides  of  the  aisle,  have  supported  them.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO GLENNA GOODACRE  ∑",2008
689,27,2008-04-21,Mr. DOMENICI.," Madam President, I  wish  to  pay  tribute  to  Glenna  Goodacre, who was recently named the  Notable New Mexican of 2008 by the Albuquerque Museum Foundation. Glenna is a nationally acclaimed sculptor  whose works  include  designing  the  Sacagawea dollar coin and sculpting  the Vietnam Women’s Memorial here  in Washington, DC.  A resident of New Mexico since 1983,  Glenna was born in Lubbock, TX. She  graduated  from Colorado College  in  Colorado Springs, CO. While obtaining  her undergraduate degree, Glenna first  showed her strong ability to persevere  in  spite of defeatist-minded  individuals. She pursued her dream to become  a sculptor despite the discouragement  she faced from her professor. At her  graduation, she gave a commencement  address titled, ‘‘Success Is the Greatest  Revenge,’’ a  speech which  reflected  back on to the opposition she once  faced.  Throughout her career, Glenna has  created many  awe-inspiring  bronze  sculptures. Her most ambitious piece,  the Irish Memorial installed at Penn’s  Landing  in Philadelphia, contains 35  life-size figures. She is also credited  with the creation of two 8-foot standing  figures of Ronald Reagan. One  stands in the Reagan Library in California and the other at the National  Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum  in Oklahoma City.  Glenna’s countless accomplishments  have won her the recognition of the  New Mexico Governor’s Award for Excellence  in the Arts and the Texas  Medal of Arts. In addition to these honors, she has also been inducted into the  Cowgirl Hall of Fame in Fort Worth.  Although a fall in early 2007 threatened  to end her dreams, Glenna bounced  back to make excellent progress in her  rehabilitation and recovery. Her experience even inspired her to dedicate her  piece titled ‘‘Crossing the Prairie’’ to  St. Vincent Regional Medical Center, a  facility which was credited with saving  her life.  The Notable New Mexican program  celebrates  the  extraordinary accomplishments  of  people  like Glenna.  Every year since 2001, the Albuquerque  Museum Foundation honors a Notable  for  his  or  her  high  achievements,  strong ties to New Mexico, and contributions  to  the public good. This  year, Glenna will  join the ranks of  former Notables such as artists Wilson  Hurley and Georgia O’Keeffe, authors  Tony Hillerman and Rudolfo Anaya,  and former Governor Bruce King.

The district I represent has benefited  from the economic and social contributions from the Asian and Pacific Islander Americans. That  includes the  Cities of Monterey Park, known as Little Taipei, Rosemead and West Covina,  as well as other neighboring communities in San Gabriel Valley. In my district, there are approximately 120,000  API descendants.  For example, according to the Chamber of Commerce, Chinese Americans  own at least two-thirds of Monterey  Park’s more than 5,000 businesses.  Many of the constituents I represent  came to America in the hopes of providing for their loved ones and plan to  reunite with their families.  This month comes at a tough time,  especially for many of those of Asian  descent, particularly those that were  affected by the recent earthquake in  China. My sympathies go to their families.  I look forward to continuing to work  with the API community and others to  bridge the gap to provide better services to all our residents and grow our  economy.  f  COUNTY PAYMENTS: CROOK  COUNTY, OREGON  (Mr. WALDEN of Oregon asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute.)  ",2008
705,2,2008-05-15,Mr. WALDEN  of Oregon.," Madam  Speaker, by refusing to renew the Federal county payments program, Congress has broken the bond with rural  areas all across this country. Counties  such as Crook County in Oregon have  been affected.  Congress’ inaction means that county’s road department’s been whacked.  It’s half what it was 10 years ago. Road  improvements needed for the future are  being  shelved. Maintenance projects  are being put on hold.  Crook County Judge Scott Cooper  said: ‘‘Congress just passed a new farm  bill to help get products from farm to  market, but without county payments,  the  products won’t  have  roads  or  bridges to go over.’’  H.R. 3058 would help solve this. It’s a  bipartisan,  4-year  authorization  for  county payments; yet the leadership of  this House has held it hostage on the  Union  Calendar  since  January  15.  That’s 121 days that the Democratic  leadership has prevented  the House  from voting to reauthorize the county  payments program.  It’s time to restore the Federal Government’s century-old commitment to  rural  timbered  communities, where  Federal lands make up the bulk of the  area.  I call on the Democratic leadership  once again, free H.R. 3058 for a vote,  and keep the roads and schools open in  rural America.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF BISHOP  LEWIS DOLPHIN STALLWORTH, SR.

706,2,2008-05-15,Mr. MCNERNEY.," Madam Speaker, I  ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Bishop Lewis Dolphin  Stallworth, Senior, who passed away  after a courageous battle with kidney  disease.  Born  in Welty, Oklahoma,  in 1923,  Bishop Stallworth found his life’s calling with the church and the community.  Bishop Stallworth was a leader in the  community, his influence extending far  beyond the church that he founded in  1963. Bishop Stallworth volunteered as  a police  chaplain, hosted a weekly  radio program, and frequently participated in local community functions. He  also used his church as a place of learning, opening a school, originally  located in the church basement, to educate young people.  He even organized a group of young  men known as Stallworth’s Soldiers,  counseling them to get an education,  stay out of trouble, and become model  members of the community.  As evidence of Bishop Stallworth’s  enduring  character and unparalleled  passion, his love for his family, church  and community, less than 5 weeks after  his death, hundreds have already petitioned the school district to consider  naming a school after him.  I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring the memory of Bishop Lewis  Dolphin Stallworth, Senior.  f  CONGRATULATIONS GREATER  LATROBE ICE CATS  (Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Head Coach Ron Makoski, who led  the  team  to victory,  reminded  the  players that, win or lose, playing in a  State championship would be  something that each of the players would  remember for the rest of their lives. I  have no doubt that each of these players will remember this experience with  great pride.  So congratulations to the Ice Cats,  the players, the coaches and parents  for capturing  the Pennsylvania Cup  Class AA Championship.  I know the school and community  join me in best wishes to the team for  their tremendous victory and distinguished season.  f  LIHEAP FUNDING  (Mr. ALTMIRE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2008
708,2,2008-05-15,Mr. ALTMIRE.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise today in support of fully funding  the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known  as LIHEAP.  With energy prices at record levels, it  is critical that Congress provides adequate LIHEAP funding to protect low-  income seniors and families from the  bitter cold in the winter and the extreme heat in the summer.  Because of rising energy prices and  limited LIHEAP funding, 62,000 Pennsylvania households  that were  supposed to receive funding this year did  not. Many of the families across the  country who were not able to obtain  LIHEAP funds will be forced to decide  between paying their energy bill or  purchasing other necessities like food  or medicine. This is a decision that no  hardworking  family  should have  to  make.  Madam Speaker, LIHEAP provides  millions of low-income Americans with  some relief  from ever rising energy  prices, but  there are millions more  that could use the help. I urge all of  my colleagues to fully support funding  for LIHEAP.  f  b1015  A SUPPLEMENTAL FOR THE  TROOPS  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina.  Madam Speaker, today the House of  Representatives will debate an emergency  supplemental  spending  bill  meant to provide needed resources to  our military. It should only provide  money for the brave men and women  fighting terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect American families at  home.  It  is, therefore, disappointing  that the supplemental bill crafted by  the Democratic leadership contains billions of dollars in nonemergency spending.  While there may be components of  the bill that should be debated, this is  not the time and certainly not the bill  to be having those debates while our  VerDate Aug 31 2005  23:38 May 15, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K15MY7.003 H15MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 1 6 C P D O R P n o e w o r e         ",2008

710,9,2008-05-15,Mr. LEVIN.," Amendment 3 concerns  unemployment compensation. It’s estimated that in the first 6 months of this  year, 1.3 million Americans will exhaust their benefits. The number of  long-term unemployed Americans is almost twice as high now as it was in the  last recession.  This is targeted at the long-term unemployed wherever they live. The Republican approach, Mr. WELLER’s approach, the President’s opposition, it’s  not targeted. It misses tens of thousands of people who are unemployed for  more than the 26 weeks. I come from  Michigan with a high unemployment  level. I want all the unemployed long-  term to be covered wherever they live.  I think it’s time that the minority  and the President get out of the offices  they reside in and get into the shoes of  typical American families.  I read a letter that came from a person  in Roseville whose husband had  lost his job as a machinist:  ‘‘With the job market as bleak as it  is today, the fear that unemployment  benefits may run out is something no  family should have to face. My husband  has been actively seeking work since  his layoff, but there’s simply nothing  to be had right now. I’ve never seen  him look so sad and upset in all our  nearly 30 years of marriage. The President and Congress must be made to understand that what is happening to the  workers of this country, and most especially, to the people of Michigan is not  something  they’ve chosen  for  themselves.’’  Opposition to extension of unemployment compensation is unconscionable.  I urge support for amendment 3.  ",2008

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California  for yielding me this time.  I have the greatest respect for the  gentleman  from Wisconsin. He  is a  good Member of this body. He is my  chairman on the full committee. He is  the chairman of my subcommittee, and  on that subcommittee we work very  well together to address the key issues  of our country.  However, Mr. Speaker, the bill before  the House today is a phony bill for  many  reasons. The  rules have been  thrown under the bus. No markup, no  conference with the Senate. First and  foremost, this product is the product of  a couple of people in a body of 435. It  does not reflect the best ideas of bipartisan membership of  the Appropriations Committee. And when it leaves  this Chamber, it will not reflect the  best ideas of the 435 Members of this  House.  While I often disagree with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee  in the Senate, Senator BYRD, at least  he stood up for his committee and for  the regular order and for the prerogatives of the Appropriations Committee  in the Senate.  I have heard over the last several  days the assertion that Members of the  minority were offered an opportunity  to participate. I must have missed it; I  don’t remember any consultation.  Mr. Speaker, I am embarrassed that  the committee on which I am so revered and on which I have been so  proud to serve for so many years has  been reduced to this phony exercise.  The  reality  is  that  the majority  knows that this bill is going to be vetoed. Staff  representing  the Democratic leadership were quoted yesterday in the press as saying: ‘‘Oh, yeah,  it will be vetoed. That’s the whole part  I forgot.’’  Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, there is a  time and place for fun, but not here  and not now. The Democratic leadership, by virtue of that flippant remark  to  the press, a  remark made quite  clearly without regard to the needs of  the men and women who risk their  lives every day in service to this great  Nation seems to me to recognize that  they  are  playing  politics with  our  troops.

728,51,2008-05-15,Mr. EDWARDS.," Mr. Speaker,  this  bill honors our troops, our veterans,  and their  families. I want to thank  Chairman OBEY for being a true champion  for our Nation’s veterans, our  troops, and our military families. His  leadership and partnership with Speaker PELOSIare why this bill includes an  historic 21st Century GI Bill of Rights,  to make college education a reality,  not a dream, for America’s veterans.  Perhaps less noticed, but vitally important  to our military  troops and  their families, we also made a commitment in this bill to significantly improve health care and daycare for military families, and housing for single  servicemen and women. Better housing, health care and daycare are our  way of letting those who defend our  Nation know that this Congress will respect their service and sacrifice in a  meaningful way.  For troops in Iraq and Afghanistan,  many of whom are on their second or  third tours of duty, this measure provides the essential facilities required  to live and fight this war so far away  from  their homes.  It  recognizes  for  force protection projects wherever our  troops are located.  For the young men and women just  volunteering now for military service,  amendment No. 3 also provides $300  million to build much-needed training  barracks and other facilities. This barracks initiative will send a clear message to our newest heroes that we deeply respect their decision to serve our  Nation.  For the men or women wounded or  ill, this amendment provides $1.3 billion to modernize outdated and inefficient military hospitals. Twenty-first  century troops and their families deserve better  than  to be  treated  in  World War II and Korean-era medical  facilities. This commitment tells our  troops they will have the best care if  they are wounded, and even more important to so many of them, that their  families will have  the best of care  while they are gone.  I want to especially thank and salute  Chairman MURTHA for his dedicated,  strong support for this military health  care  initiative. All of our military  troops deserve his thanks, and should  thank him and respect him for his leadership here.  For the families left behind here at  home while their  loved ones are at  combat overseas, this bill provides $200  million to build new child care and  youth facilities. Our military spouses  and children may not be wearing our  Nation’s uniform, but they are making  sacrifices each and every day, and we  should never forget their service to the  American family.  To address the housing, training and  other  facilities  needed  at military  bases that are growing as a result of  the 2005 Base Realignment and Closing  law, this bill fully funds the administration’s BRAC request for the fiscal  year 2008.  And let me point out, Mr. Speaker,  that individual Member earmarks were  neither  requested nor considered by  our Military Construction and VA Subcommittee. Every project funded was  either requested by the administration,  the Department of Defense, or funded  based on the merit and need for our  troops.  Voting ‘‘yes’’ on this bill is a vote to  honor our troops and our veterans.  ",2008

732,58,2008-05-15,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker, the  economy has been one of the casualties  of the Iraq war. And this administration has consistently refused to be interested in dealing with the problems  of the unemployed.  We tried to get this introduced when  we had  the  stimulus package  some  months ago. The administration didn’t  want to do anything with the unemployed. Long-term unemployment  in  this country is up to 17.9 percent. Now,  you would think they would care, but  they still aren’t asking for it.  They have never changed their tune  from  1935. They never  thought we  should have unemployment insurance  in the Social Security Act of 1935 because they said if you give people unemployment  insurance,  they  won’t  want to go to work, they will just want  to sit home and get a check. That  comes  from people who have never  been unemployed. That comes  from  people who don’t know anybody who  has ever been unemployed. It is simply  nonsense.  We need to put the money into the  economy. We need to give it to the  workers who  have  lost  their  jobs  through no fault of their own. And this  administration  still  sits  there  and  says, no, we’re not going to extend unemployment benefits.  There are 26 weeks in here; 13 for everybody, and 13 weeks for those States  that are over 6 percent.  Mr. Speaker,  the U.S. economy  is one of  the casualties of the Iraq war, and passing an  extension of unemployment benefits is nothing  less than battlefield triage for innocent American workers who have lost their jobs through  no fault of their own.  When  I  first  introduced  legislation several  months ago to extend unemployment benefits,  I had hoped the White House would declare a  cease fire so that we could act quickly and on  a bipartisan basis to help the American people  and U.S. economy.  Instead, months went by while the administration  pretended  the  gathering  economic  storm was nothing to worry about. And matters just kept getting worse.  Long-term unemployment—the percentage  of unemployed workers who have not been  able to find a job for at least 6 months—now  stands at 17.8 percent. That is something to  worry about. And act on.  My bipartisan unemployment extension bill  will extend benefits in every State for an additional 13 weeks, and in States where the overall unemployment  rate exceeds 6 percent,  there is another 13-week extension.  We are going to help the American people  weather  this storm. And at  the same  time,  we’re going to lessen the economic blow to  the U.S. economy.  We know people spend their unemployment  benefits quickly, and we know a dollar in benefits yields $1.73 in positive economic impact  as the money ripples through the economy.  Governors, mayors, State legislators, economists, advocates for working families, and the  faith community are all asking for this extension of unemployment benefits.  Only those on the far right are opposed.  They say that unemployment benefits keep  people from going out and looking for a job,  but they are both out of line and out of touch.  Across America the average unemployment  benefit is less than $300 a week—below the  poverty-level for an American family.  What we’re doing today is throwing a lifeline  to the American people. Enough damage has  already been done to the U.S. economy because of all the money spent on the endless  Iraq war.  It’s time for Congress to tend to the economic casualties at home.  Vote  for extending unemployment benefits  because it is a vote for helping the American  people.  NATIONALGOVERNORSASSOCIATION,  Washington, DC, May 1, 2008.  Hon. MAXBAUCUS,  Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  Hon. CHARLESGRASSLEY,  Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S.  Senate, Washington, DC.  Hon. CHARLESB. RANGEL,  Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,  House of Representatives, Washington, DC.  Hon. JIMMCCRERY,  Ranking Member, Committee  on Ways and  Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.  DEARCHAIRMANBAUCUS, SENATORGRASSLEY, CHAIRMANRANGELANDREPRESENTATIVE  MCCRERY: On behalf of the nation’s governors, we write to express our support for  an extension of unemployment benefits and  to request federal assistance for states to  serve a growing number of jobless individuals.  In the last month, 36 states experienced an  increase in the unemployment rate. The national unemployment rate increased to 5.1  percent in March 2008. Most notable, however, is the significant number of individuals  that are unemployed for 27 weeks or longer,  thus exhausting all unemployment benefits.  Today, approximately 16.7 percent of jobless  individuals are experiencing long-term unemployment compared to approximately 11  percent at the beginning of the last recession.  Beginning in 1935, a federal-state partnership was formed to create an unemployment  program that would provide a core stabilizing function during economic downturns  through short-term income support for jobless individuals, In prior recessions including  the economic downturn that began in 2001,  Congress and the Administration utilized the  program to extend unemployment benefits  to jobless individuals.  At the same time, any proposal to extend  unemployment benefits must also address  the reality that states need additional resources to administer unemployment claims  for a  larger number of  individuals  for a  longer period of time. This year alone, states  may have to administer an average of nearly  400,000 unemployment insurance claims without federal funding. Federal support is needed by state employment and workforce agencies to administer increased initial unemployment claims, to support weekly unemployment benefits, and to provide employment and training services.  Given the current economic indicators and  historical precedent, governors believe it is  prudent and appropriate for Congress and the  Administration to enact a temporary federally funded extension of unemployment insurance benefits and to provide a sufficient  increase in funding for states to assist jobless individuals during this period of economic slowdown.  We stand ready to work with you and  thank you for your leadership on this issue  of national importance.  Sincerely,  DONALDL.

733,65,2008-05-15,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, following is an explanation of the amendments of the House of  Representatives (relating to supplemental appropriations for fiscal years 2008 and 2009) to  the amendment of the Senate to H.R. 2642,  the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  Appropriations Act, 2008.  In  this  statement,  the provisions of  the  House amendments to the Senate amendment  are generally  referred  to as  ‘‘the amended  bill’’.  House Amendment 1 strikes lines 1 through  3 on page 60 of the Senate amendment and  inserts  language providing supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense for  fiscal year 2008, and additional supplemental  funds  for  fiscal year 2009  for operations  in  Iraq and Afghanistan.  House Amendment 2 inserts after line 3 on  page 60 of the Senate amendment language  regarding policy for operations in Iraq and reforms relating to war profiteering and contractors.  House Amendment 3 strikes line 1 on page  1 of the Senate amendment and all that follows through line 21 on page 59, and inserts  language providing supplemental appropriations for military construction, international affairs, and other security-related and domestic  needs, as well as language providing for improved veterans education benefits, temporary  extended unemployment compensation, and a  moratorium on certain Medicaid  regulations,  and establishing a surtax on high income taxpayers to offset the cost of the veterans benefit provision.  The texts of the amendments are printed in  the Rules Committee report (H. Rpt. 110–636)  to accompany House Resolution 1197.  Unless otherwise noted, all appropriations in  the amendments are designated as emergency  requirements and necessary  to meet  emergency needs pursuant to subsections (a)  and (b) of section 204 of S. Con. Res. 21, the  congressional budget resolution for fiscal year  2008.  AMENDMENT NO. 1  TITLE IX—DEFENSE MATTERS  CHAPTER 1—SUPPLEMENTAL  APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE—MILITARY  OVERVIEW  RECOMMENDATION  In title IX, chapter 1, total new appropriations of $96,622,127,000 are recommended. A  detailed review of the recommendations for  programs funded in this chapter is provided  in the following pages.  The recommended supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense are intended for ongoing military and intelligence  operations  in  support of Operation  Iraqi  Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring Freedom  (OEF), and the larger Global War on Terror  (GWOT). The recommendations in this chapter are based on the initial budget request,  an update to that request, formal hearings,  and numerous briefings and are intended to  address emergency, high-priority needs of  the United States military and intelligence  community. In some cases, funding has been  reduced or eliminated for certain activities  that are either not emergency  in nature;  that cannot be obligated and/or executed in a  timely fashion; or which involve new policy  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:59 May 16, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K15MY7.084 H15MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 1 6 C P D O R P n o e w o r e         ",2008
734,149,2008-05-15,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, after five  years, thousands of lives lost, and hundreds of  billions of dollars spent and trillions to go, the  amendments adopted today are the beginning  of a solution in Iraq. These amendments mandate the beginning of withdrawal, setting us on  a path out of Iraq, and support critical domestic and international priorities.  The language offers some of the same prescriptions in my own Iraq legislation, including  a ban on permanent bases and an increase in  contractor oversight. All too often we hear reports of billions of dollars our contractors can’t  account  for, or  the hiring of  individuals our  troops can’t rely on. This war will cost over $3  trillion, and I am pleased to see some funding  shifted to cover more of our international obligations.  I authored  legislation  to help  the 4  million displaced Iraqis and I support the funding in this bill for migration and refugee assistance and international disaster assistance. We  have a responsibility to the Iraqi people, and  as we have an obligation to provide for our  own.  Part of remedying  this  tragedy will be rebuilding the health and readiness of our armed  forces.  In my  state,  the Oregon National  Guard’s  41st Combat Brigade  Team  has  served two tours in Iraq and Afghanistan since  9/11, and  is scheduled  to deploy again  in  2009. When they return, these brave men and  women deserve the best care this country can  provide and the least we can do is make sure  education and retraining is available and affordable. I am proud to support an expansion  of the GI Bill education benefits that proved so  successful in transitioning our troops after W  orId War II and in mobilizing our economy for  succeeding generations. Frankly I find it unconscionable  that President Bush, as Commander in Chief of our armed forces, would  threaten to veto this legislation on account of  this  basic  and  historic  investment  in  our  troops.  This country is ready for change, and these  amendments are an  important step  forward.  As  this  issue  develops  over  the  coming  weeks,  I  remain  committed  to getting our  troops out of Iraq now and providing our veterans with the best care available.  ",2008
735,149,2008-05-15,Mr. CASTLE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of the three amendments before us today to  H.R. 2642. Our  troops have done  incredible  work in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it is critical  that we  provide  them with  the  protective  equipment,  operating  funds,  and  counterterrorism resources necessary to execute their  missions. For this reason, I support the funding in this package for vital priorities like mine  resistant ambush protected vehicles, IED jamming devices, military healthcare,  traumatic  brain injury research, and military family support programs.  As a  leader of  the House Committee on  Education, I have long advocated for a permanent expansion of GI Bill education benefits  for veterans. For the first time, the funding in  this package would reward those soldiers who  stepped forward in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks by allowing them to receive expanded education benefits  in proportion  to  their period of service. The men and women  who serve in our Nation’s armed forces deserve the opportunity to pursue an education  and I believe this provision represents a significant step  towards  the  realization of  that  goal.  In addition  to  financial assistance, our  government must help veterans cut  through  the red-tape surrounding GI bill benefits and I  have introduced legislation to aid our soldiers  in making this transition.  There has to be an incentive for the Iraqi  government to make political progress and it is  critical  that we begin shifting  the day-to-day  combat mission over  to  the  Iraqi  security  forces. I continue to oppose proposals in Congress that would hamstring our troops by setting a hard deadline for troop withdrawal. Last  September, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker outlined a responsible plan for  gradually redeploying our troops from Iraq and  I believe this plan should move forward in a  way that maintains security and stability in the  Middle East. Therefore, I support provisions in  this bill that would set a goal of redeploying a  majority of our combat troops from Iraq by the  end of 2009, while permitting forces to remain  in the region to conduct counterterrorism operations and assist  the  Iraqi security  forces.  Clearly, our military and foreign policy leaders  must retain the ability to react to conditions on  the ground and I believe this provision allows  them  the appropriate  flexibility  in executing  their mission without conditioning troop funding on arbitrary  timelines or an  immediate  deadline for troop withdrawal.  Additionally,  I support  language  in  the bill  that would improve transparency and oversight  of contractors to prevent waste and abuse in  government spending. In the same way, I support sections of the bill that would require better accountability from the Iraqi government by  providing an  incentive  for a greater  Iraqi  investment in the country’s reconstruction. Embracing a comprehensive regional diplomatic  initiative, ensuring American soldiers are properly  trained and prepared  for deployments,  and prohibiting torture are also key provisions  which I continue to support.  Lastly, while I intend to vote in favor of this  emergency spending package,  I continue  to  have deep concerns about  the manner  in  which it was brought forward. In my estimate,  the leaders of the House have unfairly manipulated congressional rules in severely limiting  debate on this measure and restricting input  from both Republicans and Democrats. Rather  than using this issue as a tool to score points  politically, Members  from both sides of  the  aisle should come  together  in support of a  workable policy to bring our troops home.  To date, over 4,000 American soldiers—including sixteen brave Delawareans—have lost  their lives in Iraq. Close to 500 U.S. service  members have also died in Afghanistan. Mr.  Speaker, I call on my colleagues to embrace  the substantive areas of this bill where we can  find agreement, and join me in committing to  a bipartisan approach  for achieving stability  and bringing our troops home to their families.  ",2008
736,149,2008-05-15,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of H.R. 5740, the Post 9/11 Veterans  Education Assistance Act—bipartisan  legislation that honors our men and women in uniform and strengthens our military.  Since World War II, our nation has offered  education benefits to returning GIs. The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, the first  GI Bill, which was passed unanimously by this  House, paid for the tuition, books, fees, training costs, and even a monthly stipend for our  returning veterans.  After World War II, nearly 8 million veterans,  out of a wartime veteran population of 15 million, used the original GI Bill to earn an education. The economic  return was unprecedented. For every dollar we spent on the GI  Bill, we generated 7 more  into our national  economy. Millions of newly-educated veterans  led our Nation in business and innovation and  created  the American middle class.  It’s no  wonder the GI Bill of 1944 is regarded as one  of the most successful pieces of legislation to  earn this House’s approval in the 20th Century.  Since that time, Congress has passed other  GI bills, but over time, the value of the education benefit has declined. The current Montgomery GI Bill, for example, was designed for  peacetime service, and  is not meeting  the  needs of our newest generation of veterans,  many of whom are returning from combat in  Iraq and Afghanistan.  Our veterans—whether active duty, Reservists or National Guardsmen—deserve an education benefit that accounts for the stress of  war and keeps up with the rapidly increasing  cost of a higher education. That is why, with  the backing of a broad, bipartisan coalition, I  introduced H.R. 5740, the Post-9/l1 Veterans  Educational Assistance Act.  Under  the  legislation, GIs  returning  from  Iraq or Afghanistan would receive up to four  academic years of education benefits, including stipends for housing and books. They can  even use  their benefits at private schools  through the Yellow Ribbon G.I. Education Enhancement Program, in which the federal government will match, dollar for dollar, any voluntary  additional  contributions  to  veterans  from institutions whose tuition is more expensive than the maximum educational assistance  provided under this legislation.  Veterans would even have up to 15 years  after they leave active duty to use their education benefits. I am pleased that this bill was  included as part of the emergency war funding  measure that the House is considering today  because  I believe  taking care of  those who  serve in war is a cost of war. America should  never  fight wars without  taking care of our  own. However, I am deeply troubled by how  we got to this point, and am disappointed that  this issue has become politicized.  When I was elected to this House, my constituents asked me to work in a bipartisan way  to  find reasonable solutions  to our common  problems. And that is what I tried to do with  this GI Bill. Working together with my Democratic and Republican colleagues, we attracted  more than two-thirds of the House as cosponsors. Ninety-two Republicans, nearly half of  the minority party’s membership,  lent  their  support. But instead of using that coalition to  secure overdue educational benefits  for our  veterans, our leadership has allowed ideological gotcha games to prevail.  What began as an attempt to fix a broken  promise to our veterans has devolved into a  fight over who can score  the most political  points. As a result, instead of sending a veto-  proof bill  to  the Senate, we are sending a  lesser bill with a  less certain outcome. This  does not hurt any of our political opponents,  Mr. Speaker; it only hurts our veterans. And,  frankly, they deserve better. Our soldiers and  veterans deserve a House whose actions  matches its rhetoric. If we mean what we say,  that taking care of those who serve is truly a  cost of war,  then  the GI Bill should be  included as a part of our war spending.  I was astonished yesterday when, amidst all  the platitudes some members of this chamber  made about the need for the GI Bill to meet  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:38 May 16, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00149 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A15MY7.105 H15MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 1 6 C P D O R P n o e w o r e         ",2008
737,156,2008-05-15,Ms. ESHOO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  opposition to continued war funding for Iraq.  I voted against  the war and have never  wavered in my opposition to the Administration’s misguided policies in Iraq.  It has been a long and painful 5 year journey for the people of our country since the Administration acted preemptively and unilaterally  to invade and occupy Iraq.  Military  leaders,  the best minds  in  foreign  and economic policy, and the vast majority of  the American people have been resoundingly  clear: The Administration’s war-without-end  policy is not a strategy for success.  As retired General William Odom, former Director of the National Security Agency under  President Reagan and member of the National  Security Council under President Carter stated, ‘‘Getting out of Iraq is the pre-condition for  creating new strategic options.’’  I cannot support war funding without a clear  exit strategy in sight. It is bad for our troops,  our country, and our standing in the world.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of today’s second amendment that includes a clear path out  of Iraq, a plan that my constituents and the  vast majority of Americans are demanding.  More than 5 years ago the President proclaimed ‘‘Mission Accomplished’’ in Iraq. Paradoxically, he insists on a permanent U.S. presence there. And what exactly has this Administration ‘‘accomplished’’ in Iraq?  More  than 4,000 U.S. soldiers have been  killed and almost 30,000 injured; tens of thousands  Iraqi civilian deaths; an emboldened  Iran and new threats from Al Qaeda in the region; $519 billion taxpayer dollars spent and a  future expenditure of some $3 trillion; a hobbled Iraqi government unable to provide clean  water, medical care,  jobs  for  its people, or  pass critical oil sharing legislation; a U.S. military on the verge of collapse and unable to  press vigorously  the critical  fight  in Afghanistan or respond to other crises in the world;  and still no exit strategy.  With no end game in sight, the Administration  and  its  supporters  in Congress  are  complicit  in a continuation of a  failed policy  which  they  insist on extending with a blank  check policy to accompany it.  The President owes it to our brave men and  women in Iraq and their families, he owes it to  the American people, and he owes it to the  citizens of Iraq not to leave this mess for the  next President to finish.  This bill establishes a clear path out of Iraq.  The  language requires  the Administration  to  begin redeployment 30 days after enactment  and  requires Secretary Gates  to submit  to  Congress within 90 days a  report detailing  plans to reduce and redeploy troops from Iraq.  It prohibits sending troops to Iraq that are not  assessed as  ‘‘fully mission capable’’ of performing  their assigned mission, and outlaws  the presence of a permanent U.S. base there.  Additionally,  this provision  requires  the  Iraqi  government to match every U.S. dollar spent  for training and infrastructure construction and  repair. Finally, it prohibits the intelligence community from subjecting detainees to interrogation  techniques not authorized by  the U.S.  Army Field Manual. This will essentially abolish the use of water torture and begin to restore America’s standing in the world community.  As a member of  the Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence it is vital that we extend  the ban on  torture  to  the  Intelligence  agencies. The President has said he will veto  any ban on torture, clearly demonstrating his  desire to reserve for himself the right to subject detainees to these horrendous techniques.  Congress has an obligation to make it clear  that the American people do not believe in torture and will not allow it to continue.  This amendment sets a decisive course out  of Iraq and begins to shift responsibilities to  the Iraqi government. I urge my colleagues to  heed  the demands of  the American people  and support this strategy.  Mr. Speaker, I’m very pleased that the Appropriations Committee included two important  provisions in today’s third amendment. First, it  includes critical funding for Iraqi Christians and  second, it modernizes and improves the G.I.  bill.  I’m pleased  that  the amendment contains  $10 million for vulnerable Iraqi minorities, including Christians. The needs of Assyrians in  Iraq could not be greater. A report produced  by the Department of State on U.S. assistance  to the Nineveh Plains in Iraq concluded that  Christian minorities have experienced serious  human rights abuses  in  the Nineveh Plains.  The report also states that the region has absorbed a significant number of Christian internally displaced persons  (IDPs) moving  from  the south, placing an economic burden in the  area.  They are  fleeing because  they are being  threatened and murdered in their home communities. Their priests are being executed,  their churches burned, and their nuns threatened.  In February of  this year, Archbishop  Paulos Rahho was abducted and murdered in  Mosul.  While Assyrians only represented 5 percent  of the total Iraqi population before the war, according to the United Nations today they comprise as much as 40 percent of the growing  Iraqi refugees who have fled for their lives to  Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey.  These  families desperately need security,  housing, jobs, schools and the chance to live  in a sustainable community where  they can  openly practice their faith. This funding is essential to their survival.  Also included in this amendment is a modernization of  the G.I. bill. The G.I. bill has  been heralded as one of the most successful  government programs in the history of our Nation. It gave millions of G.I.s the chance to go  to college, many of whom were the first to receive a college education in their families. But  the G.I. bill is over 54 years old and has not  kept up with rising tuition costs.  According  to a recent Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.) survey, 18 percent of the  veterans recently back from tours of duty are  unemployed. Of those employed since leaving  the military, 25 percent earn less than $21,840  a year. The survey also demonstrated  that  only 48.4 percent of the respondents took advantage of the G.I. bill and concluded that receiving the benefits of the current G.I. bill was  not a strong predictor of successful employment outcomes.  This survey clearly demonstrates the need  for this new G.I. bill. The amendment provides  veterans with a maximum educational benefit  equal to the highest tuition rate of a public college or university in their State, as well as a  monthly stipend  for housing.  It also establishes a new program  in which private educational institutions would make financial contributions toward veterans’ tuition, and the federal government would match those contributions.  When our veterans return from the battlefield,  they should have every opportunity  to  enter the classroom and ultimately the civilian  workforce. Our Nation needs these brave men  and women  to contribute  to  the growth and  health of our economy and this new G.I. bill  accomplishes this.  From development  funding  for  Iraqi Christians  to  the creation of a new G.I. bill,  this  amendment addresses specific urgent needs  for our Nation and world. The amendment is  well crafted and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.  ",2008

742,163,2008-05-15,Mr. FRANCIS of Arizona.," Mr. Speaker  I  stand once again before this House with yet  another Sunset Memorial.  It is May 15, 2008, in the land of the free  and  the home of  the brave, and before  the  sun set today in America, almost 4,000 more  defenseless unborn children were killed by  abortion on demand. That’s  just  today, Mr.  Speaker. That’s more than the number of innocent  lives  lost on September 11  in  this  country, only it happens every day.  It has now been exactly 12,897 days since  the  tragedy called Roe v. Wade was  first  handed down. Since then, the very foundation  of this Nation has been stained by the blood  of almost 50 million of its own children. Some  of them, Mr. Speaker, died and screamed as  they did so, but because it was amniotic fluid  passing over the vocal cords instead of air, no  one could hear them.  And all of them had at least four things in  common. First, they were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone,  and each one of them died a nameless and  lonely death. And each one of their mothers,  whether she realizes it or not, will never be  quite  the same. And all  the gifts  that  these  children might have brought to humanity are  now lost forever. Yet even in the glare of such  tragedy, this generation still clings to a blind,  invincible ignorance while history repeats itself  and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims, those  yet unborn.  Mr. Speaker, perhaps it’s time for those of  us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of why  we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said,  ‘‘The care of human life and its happiness and  not its destruction is the chief and only object  of good government.’’ The phrase in the 14th  Amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution,  it says, ‘‘No State shall deprive any person of  life, liberty or property without due process of  law.’’ Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our  innocent citizens and their constitutional rights  is why we are all here.  The bedrock foundation of this Republic is  the clarion declaration of the self-evident truth  that all human beings are created equal and  endowed by their Creator with the unalienable  rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has  ever faced can be traced to our commitment  to this core, self-evident truth.  It has made us the beacon of hope for the  entire world. Mr. Speaker, it is who we are.  And yet today another day has passed, and  we in this body have failed again to honor that  foundational commitment. We have failed our  sworn oath and our God-given responsibility  as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without  the protection we should have given them.  Mr. Speaker, let me conclude in the hope  that perhaps someone new who heard  this  Sunset Memorial  tonight will  finally embrace  the truth that abortion really does kill little babies; that it hurts mothers in ways that we can  never express; and  that 12,897 days spent  killing nearly 50 million unborn children  in  America is enough; and that the America that  rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust is still courageous and compassionate enough  to  find a  better way for mothers and their unborn babies than abortion on demand.  So tonight, Mr. Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too  soon each one of us will walk  from  these  Chambers for the very last time.  And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come,  may that be the day when we finally hear the  cries of innocent unborn children. May that be  the day when we find the humanity, the courage, and  the will  to embrace  together our  human and our constitutional duty to protect  these,  the  least of our  tiny,  little American  brothers  and  sisters  from  this murderous  scourge upon our Nation called abortion on  demand.  It is May 15, 2008, 12,897 days since Roe  versus Wade  first stained  the  foundation of  this Nation with the blood of its own children,  this in the land of the free and the home of the  brave.  f  b1630  A CLEAN SUPPLEMENTAL TO  FUND OUR TROOPS  ",2008
743,163,2008-05-15,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2008
744,163,2008-05-15,Mr. GOHMERT.," Mr. Speaker,  this  afternoon an extraordinary thing did  happen when we had a vote on a supplemental with all kinds of strings attached to  it to  fund our troops  in  harm’s way.  The Democrats have the majority.  They have the ability to pass that  funding without a bit of help from the  Republicans.  Many of us on the Republican side of  the aisle were quite concerned, however, with the strings, with the linkages that were made to this bill to help  our troops do their job. One, for example, was that in the second amendment,  which we knew would pass, provisions  there existed to create hard and fast  deadlines for pulling our troops out of  Iraq.  We all want to see our troops home.  We all want to see our troops back  with us. And those of us who go over to  Iraq and see them in harm’s way, we  long for the time of having them home  completely. But the vast majority of  those guys in record numbers re-enlist  because they know they’re doing good.  They know they are making a difference. And when you go over there,  you see it. I was in Kurdistan in December, in the northern area of Iraq.  Construction  booming,  things  going  well.  We have made a difference with the  surge. It is a profound difference. We  have al Qaeda on the run. They’re making  last-ditch efforts to try to stop  what’s going on. We have the Iraqi people that are there working for themselves, more  soldiers, more  police  trained  than ever. There are  really  good things going on. And were we to  pass a supplemental that was linked to  that second amendment with the time  deadlines, the message would be a message of hope for all those who hate us  and want to destroy us. And that is: ‘‘If  you will just hold on a little bit longer,  we will have the Americans put their  heads between their legs and go cowering away, as they did  from Vietnam.’’ We could have won Vietnam; we  can succeed in Iraq.  The great state of Iraq is so close to  governing itself. Just like John Adams  wrote  to Abigail, what people have  only dreamed of, governing themselves  is so close, within our reach. We can’t  give it up now. It’s so close. Iraq is  there. We cannot hand our enemies and  the Iraqi enemies, the enemies of liberty, this kind of win.  So we voted ‘‘present.’’ If the Democrats had had enough votes, then they  would have passed the supplemental by  itself and it would have been linked to  the second amendment that would have  required the time deadlines for withdrawal and would have given hope. As  it was, we couldn’t vote against our  troops, many  of us,  but we  voted  ‘‘present.’’  The first amendment that we took up  this afternoon failed; so now we have  got to come back with a clean supplemental to help our troops.

I  appreciate all the Senators who came  over and spoke so forcefully and favorably for this bill. There are a few more  speakers who want to speak this morning, and then we will have a little bit  of a wrap-up again.  Mr. President, I yield the floor for  others who want to start speaking on  the farm bill.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.  ",2008
747,177,2008-05-15,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President,  I  again thank Senator HARKIN for his  leadership on this issue. We did have a  good,  long debate  last night, and a  number of folks had an opportunity to  come over and voice  their opinion  about  the bill. We  look  forward  to  wrapping this up this morning and having a vote, hopefully, around  11:15,  11:30.  I urge  those  folks who want  to  speak—we have had a number who have  indicated they wish some time. Obviously, we are pretty squeezed with a  compacted morning this morning, so  folks need to make their wishes known  and be here to be ready to speak.  I wish to start off by recognizing the  Senator from Idaho, who has been a  critical asset to us with respect particularly to the specialty crop section  in this farm bill. I ask the Chair to recognize Senator CRAIGfor 5 minutes.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.  ",2008
748,177,2008-05-15,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. President, it gives  me great pleasure to come to the floor  in the final hours of the debate over agricultural policy in this country and  to, first and foremost, thank the two  principals, who are here on the floor,  the chairman and ranking member of  the Senate Ag Committee. They have  done yeoman work in a very difficult  process—15 titles and 673 pages of policy—in what is, without question, one  of the most complicated efforts at putting public policy and interest groups  within the agricultural community together in some degree of harmony. I  thank my colleagues for the work they  have done.  Mr. President, I will be brief, as I  have already come to the floor several  times to discuss the valuable programs  included in this bill. But I would be remiss not to take the opportunity to  thank my colleagues—and this Congress—for producing a good product for  the American people.  We have been ‘‘tangled in inaction’’  on so many issues. The American people want a functional Congress.  The 2008 farm bill conference report  represents a monumental feat for the  U.S. Congress. Every 5 years, we undertake the task of reauthorizing our farm  policy. This version includes 15 titles;  673 pages.  Though  some who  have  not  yet  served on an agriculture committee  during the reauthorization of a farm  bill may disagree, let me assure you  this  is one of the most complicated  pieces of legislation considered by Congress, and it is also one of the most important.  In an age of  skyrocketing energy  prices, economic uncertainty, and now  a global food crisis, there is at least  one thing we should be able to be certain of: our Nation’s food security. We  cannot take for granted our ability to  feed ourselves, lest we become dependent on other countries for our food in  addition to our oil.  How do we achieve  food security?  Here are a few key principles.  First and foremost, we enact policy  designed to keep our  food producers  productive and profitable, and ensure  access to those foods for all Americans.  This includes things such as a safety  net to protect farmers from volatile  price swings; and nutrition programs  that give access to  fresh  fruits and  vegetables in schools.  We  enact policy  that  incentivizes  state-of-the-art conservation practices  to encourage the best possible stewardship of our agricultural lands. This will  ensure these lands stay productive and  profitable for future generations. And  we enact policy that helps American  agriculture continue to diversify—including becoming a larger player not  only in our food security, but also in  our energy security.  This bill does just that. This bipartisan work product—aptly named the  Food, Conservation and Energy Act of  2008—sets a strong and secure direction  for our food, conservation and energy  future.  The bill has broad support from virtually every corner of my State of  Idaho, and every corner of the Nation.  Congress has heard from rural farmers to urban food banks calling for passage of this vital piece of legislation.  Mr. President,  500  farm, conservation, nutrition,  consumer, and  religious groups sent a letter supporting  passage of the farm bill conference report.  These groups—with one voice—recognized that the bill ‘‘makes significant  farm policy reforms, protects the safety net for all of America’s food producers, addresses important infrastructure needs  for  specialty  crops,  increases  funding to  feed our nation’s  poor, and enhances support for important conservation initiatives.’’  It is not a perfect bill—we all will  admit this—but it is a great bill. I commend my colleagues for their work.  The President has stated his intention to veto this bill. It is not often  that I so strongly disagree with our  Commander  in Chief, but on this  I  must. There are too many great things  in this bill to deny its passage over a  few areas of disagreement, too many  important  things  for my State  of  Idaho, and for the Nation.  We began several years ago to ensure  that specialty crops were adequately  recognized in this new farm bill. We  now have a new title devoted to horticulture  and  organic  agriculture.  It  dedicates approximately $3 billion for  specialty crop, pest and disease, nutrition, research, trade and conservation  priorities important to this vital industry that represents nearly half of all  crop cash receipts in our country, including: $466 million for Specialty Crop  Block Grants to support local efforts to  enhance competitiveness of local products; $1 billion to expand the Fresh  Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program to  all  50 States—which will  help  our  school children develop healthy eating  habits; $377 million for a pest and disease program to combat costly damage  to crops such as our famous potatoes;  $230 million for the Specialty Crop Research Initiative to address food safety,  mechanization,  plant  breeding,  and  other priorities; $59 million for trade  assistance and market promotion to  maintain and grow our international  markets; and many other programs.  Idaho’s  famous potatoes, our burgeoning table grape and wine grape industry, our apples and onions and carrots  and  nursery  and  ornamental  crops—and this just touches the surface of both our current production and  our potential to continue to diversify.  Now, it should be noted that this is  only one part of the effort to ensure  the competitiveness of our specialty  crop industry. The next step is to ensure that we have an adequate workforce to conduct the labor in which the  average American refuses to participate. The harvesting of those healthy  fruits and vegetables—this, I contend,  is as  important, or more  important,  than  these  ‘‘competitiveness’’  priorities that we have finally set forward  in the farm bill. So our work is not  done.  And I could go on for a great deal of  time, talking about: the commodity  programs that create a vital safety net  for our wheat, barley, peas,  lentils,  chickpeas, oilseeds, sugar, wool producers, and so on; the conservation  programs that will help Idaho’s booming dairy  industry address  environmental  challenges  associated  with  their growth, and our crop producers to  incorporate better  stewardship practices; the nutrition programs that are  vital to improving the health of our  youth; the rural development programs  that will ensure  funding  for  things  such as water and wastewater programs, broadband, and rural housing;  the energy programs that will help us  reach the 36 billion gallon RFS by creating new incentives for cellulosic ethanol and beginning to pare down the  subsidy  for  corn-based  ethanol;  the  wildlife programs, such as the provision authored by my colleague from  Idaho, that creates incentives for endangered species recovery; the forestry,  trade, credit, disaster programs.  Those programs that will benefit the  Nation—and my State of Idaho in particular—are simply too vast to cover.

749,184,2008-05-15,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Washington is recognized.  ,2008
750,184,2008-05-15,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, farming is a critical part of the economy in  my home state of Washington. Many  people don’t know it, but Washington  is the Nation’s 11th-largest farm State.  And we are the third-largest producer  of fruits and vegetables—which are also  known around here as specialty crops.  So the  farm bill we are considering  today will help keep my state healthy  and strong. It will help them find markets for their crops here and abroad—  and it will help fund research to ensure  they have healthy and safe crops in the  future. This isn’t a perfect bill. But it  is a very good bill for Washington state  farmers. And that is why I rise today.  The biggest victory for Washington  state in this bill is the more than $3  billion to help farmers who grow apples, cherries, grapes, potatoes, asparagus, and many other fruits and vegetables. This is the first time Congress  has passed a farm bill that includes  comprehensive  provisions  addressing  the needs of specialty crop  farmers.  This  legislation will really help our  farmers by carrying out programs that  I have been pushing for over the last  several years. And I want to thank my  colleagues, Senators HARKIN, CONRAD,  CHAMBLISS, BAUCUS, and GRASSLEY for  their hard work on this bill.  The farm bill conference report includes $224 million  in block grants,  which will allow local fruit and vegetable growers to increase the competitiveness of their crops and $15 million  in badly needed aid for asparagus farmers. Asparagus  farmers  in my home  State—and  elsewhere—are  struggling  to compete with a flood of cheap asparagus  being  imported  from Peru.  I  worked very hard through conference  negotiations to make sure that this  market loss program stayed in the bill,  and I am very grateful to our conference chairs for keeping it in.  This bill helps farmers find new markets abroad for their crops, which will  allow them to better compete in the  global marketplace. For example, it increases funding for the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops program,  which helps our farmers overcome barriers that threaten our exports. And,  farmers in my home State are really  eager for this program. Last fall, I held  a  listening  session  in Yakima, WA,  where I heard from cherry farmers who  are trying to develop a new market in  Japan. And this bill would help them  build on those efforts.  I am especially pleased that this bill  includes $20 million for the National  Clean Plant Network. Farmers who  grow apples, peaches, and grapes depend on this program to ensure we  have a source of clean plant stock to  help prevent the spread of viruses. A  single infected plant or grape vine can  wipe out an entire established orchard  or vineyard. So this is very important.  Washington State University has been  leading the effort to ensure our farmers  have  virus-  and  disease-free  plant  stock. And I am proud that they will be  an important part of this national network.  Now, a lot of people don’t realize that  the farm bill isn’t just about farmers.  Well over half of this bill authorizes  funding  for  school  lunches,  food  stamps, and other nutrition programs.  And since obesity is one of the biggest  nutrition challenges we  face  in this  country, this bill specifically targets  funding to ensure that families receiving  food  stamps,  and kids  getting  school lunches will have more access to  fresh fruits and vegetables. My home  State of Washington would get $9 million in nutrition program funding next  year alone.  And finally, this bill will be a lifeline  for  food banks and other emergency  food providers, which have struggled  with rising food prices and the downturn in the economy.  As I said from the beginning, this bill  isn’t perfect. I wish that we were able  to include important improvements to  the safety net that is so critical to our  wheat farmers. I have been working for  several years with wheat  farmers  in  Washington State to improve the countercyclical payment program to really  make it work for them. Unfortunately,  we couldn’t make significant changes  in this bill. But I am happy that it continues to provide a safety net for our  wheat growers.  Now, I have just walked through numerous examples of how this farm bill  is good for my State—and for the Nation. And that  is why I am so disappointed to hear President Bush say  that he plans to veto it. At the end of  the day, none of us got everything we  wanted in this bill—including the administration. But the conference report does do a lot of good. It helps  farmers, who are  struggling as gas  prices  soar and  foreign competition  threatens  their  livelihoods. And  it  helps millions of low-income families,  who are struggling just to put food on  the table.  Mr. President, we have got to get beyond politics on this. Making sure that  our farmers and our kids both benefit  from investments in the programs in  this bill is absolutely critical. We are  not just talking about numbers. These  programs can make or break people’s  livelihoods. And I urge my colleagues  to support them by approving this bill.  ",2008

754,184,2008-05-15,Ms. KLOBUCHAR.," Mr. President,  yesterday afternoon the House of Representatives passed the farm bill conference report by a vote of 318 to 106.  The Senate will vote in a few minutes  and we expect to have an overwhelming  majority in favor of this farm bill. I  thank Senator HARKIN for his great  leadership, and Senator CHAMBLISS—it  was a bipartisan effort—as well as Senator CONRADand Senator BAUCUS, all  the members of the committee, and I  want to take special note of my good  friend Representative COLLINPETERSON  from  the State  of Minnesota who  showed such leadership in the House.  America’s farm safety net was created during the Great Depression as an  essential reform to help support rural  communities  and  protect  struggling  family  farmers  from  the  financial  shocks of volatile weather and equally  volatile commodity prices.  Almost 75 years later the reasons for  maintaining that strong safety net are  still there. The weather is still volatile, as we have seen this year. Crops  are still subject to blight and disease.  Farming is still a very risk-intensive  business. We have seen prices going up  and down—recently down in Asia—as  we have seen investment and speculation in the farm market. I think it is  very important that we have a safety  net as we look at our food security so  we don’t get in the same place as we  are with our lack of energy security.  I want to mention a few important  things to my State in this bill—the  sugar program, the dairy program, and  the conservation program. I know we  have people here in attendance from  Pheasants Forever. The conservation  groups worked very hard on this—the  nutrition assistance. But I especially  wanted to mention the part of the bill  that I worked on, the cellulosic piece,  which looked to the next generation of  biofuels—looking  at  prairie  grass,  switchgrass, other forms of biomass. As  we look to, say, the country of Brazil,  which is energy efficient—energy independent, based on sugarcane—we can  do it in this country.  I believe we have to go beyond our  crop-based ethanol and look at these  other forms of ethanol and this bill creates the incentives so we can use energy crops  such as  switchgrass and  prairie grass and do it in a way that is  consistent with conservation, which is  why I am so proud we have the support  of the conservation groups that are  with us today.  I was a strong proponent for reform  in this bill. It didn’t have everything I  asked for, as Senator MURRAYwas discussing; no bill is perfect. But we had  significant problems  in the  last  few  years with a small number of people—  real estate developers from Florida, art  collector from San Francisco, 100 people from the Beverly Hills 90210 area  code—collecting  money.  This  bill  eliminates the three-entity rule. Also,  the conferees have included substantial  income limits for those who participate  in  the  commodity  program—  $500,000 in nonfarm income, and they  are banned from getting subsidies; and  then third, $750,000 for farm-related income.  Frankly, you can go a long way in  Minnesota without  bumping  into  a  farmer who made  $750,000 after  expenses. The reform in this bill may not  be perfect but it is a lot better than  where we were before.

772,198,2008-05-15,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak in support of the 2008 farm bill. I  thank the chairman, TOMHARKIN of  Iowa, and Senator SAXBYCHAMBLISSof  Georgia  for their  leadership on this  bill.  This is, on balance, a good bill, but it  could be better. In particular, I am  concerned that we were not more aggressive in making sure that the commodity program payments are targeted  and justified. At a time when millions  of middle-class Americans are struggling to keep up with higher gas prices,  grocery bills, and health care costs, the  Federal Government should not be in  the business of sending checks to millionaire land owners.  Currently, most full-time farmers are  eligible for farm subsidies regardless of  income. Many of my colleagues and I  began this process hoping that Congress would change this situation in  the farm bill. Unfortunately, the conference agreement rejected all farmer  income tests  for the countercyclical  and marketing loan subsidy programs  and includes only a weak net income  cap  for direct payments: $750,000  for  single farmers and $1.5 million for married farmers after all business deductions.  The conference  report also waives  payment limits for the Marketing Loan  Program. The current cap  is $75,000.  Millionaire land owners are now eligible for unlimited LDP payments without any income test.  In addition, the bill puts in place provisions that shield our domestic sugar  program  from all  international competition. Sugar growers secured an increase in price supports and a guarantee of 85 percent of the domestic  sugar market  at  these  guaranteed  prices. This isn’t reform and it isn’t  justified.  I am disappointed with other aspects  of the bill as well.  There is less than $100 million in the  bill for rural development. Rural communities are aching  for water and  wastewater infrastructure, high speed  telecommunications, and financing for  business  development.  This  bill  underfunds that key priority. In conference, a program designed to improve  broadband  deployment  by  providing  cost-share assistance to statewide nonprofits was removed. This was a missed  opportunity  to  improve  access  to  broadband  in rural areas at a time  when the United States is falling farther and  farther behind  in this key  area.  The bill provides marginal  funding  for agricultural research. The bill provides  less than $100 million  for the  McGovern-Dole School Feeding Program, which uses U.S. commodities to  feed some of the world’s poorest children in schools.  However, the bill makes significant  investments in nutrition, conservation,  and renewable energy programs. It creates a forward-thinking revenue-based  safety net. The members of the Senate  Agriculture Committee can be proud of  these components of the package.  The most significant impact of this  package may be in the nutrition title.  In Illinois, over 158,000 households experienced hunger in 2005. If we include  households that have had to struggle  to put food on the table or have had to  skip meals to make sure the food would  last through the week, it adds up to  500,000 households  in  Illinois  living  with food insecurity. These are working families who just are not able to  make ends meet.  This  farm bill provides $10 billion  more over 10 years for domestic nutrition programs that help lower income  families put food on the table, including $7.8 billion for the Food Stamp Program, $1.25 billion for the Emergency  Food Assistance Program, TEFAP, and  $1 billion for the fresh fruits and vegetables snack program.  In Illinois, over the next 10 years,  this bill will provide $373 million in additional funding to help families that  haven’t been able to outrun hunger.  In the Food Stamp Program, the bill  will raise the standard deduction and  the minimum benefit and index them  for inflation. Nationwide, that helps 11  million low income people, including  families with  children,  seniors, and  people with disabilities. The adjustment to the standard deduction will increase benefits for 415,000 Illinois residents, and the minimum benefit  increase will boost benefits for 27,000 Illinois recipients.  This farm bill also eliminates the cap  on the dependent care deduction and no  longer counts retirement accounts and  education accounts toward the asset  limit.  The  conference  report  helps  food  banks and  soup kitchens meet  the  growing demand for assistance by increasing funding for commodity purchases  for TEFAP—The Emergency  Food Assistance Program—by $110 million each year. The bill increases the  availability of fruits and vegetables in  low-income schools.  And, I am glad to report that this  package includes a modified version of  the Hunger Free Communities Act, a  grant program I have long supported  that will help fight hunger in communities. This antihunger grant program  is the first program that will encourage communities to work together to  identify and address hunger locally.  What we see here is strong bipartisan  support to end hunger. Even with a war  abroad and budget deficits at home,  this Senate made  the decision  that  progress against hunger is possible.  This farm bill makes another important investment, to protect open lands  and restore habitat for future generations to enjoy. The USDA administers  the largest conservation easement programs and this bill continues and expands those programs.  In Illinois, there are a total of 78,000  contracts statewide and more than 1  million acres in the CRP program, including more than 55,000 acres of wetlands. The Wetlands Reserve Program  is aiding in what will become the second largest restoration of wetlands in  the United States, in Emiquon in Fulton County, IL.  These open spaces provide important  wildlife habitat and recreation benefits  and  prevent  erosion  of  sensitive  ground. The conservation title makes  significant  investments  in  the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality  Incentives Program,  the Conservation Security Program,  and the Farmland Protection Program.  Unfortunately, a key provision that I  originally authored  in the 2002  farm  bill to prevent over-planting on sensitive land, called Sodsaver, was significantly  weakened  in  conference.  These  weak  protections,  combined  what can only be called the most generous Commodity Title in history relative to market conditions, provides  perverse  incentives  to  overproduce,  which will result in the breaking up of  sensitive ground.  The investments made in conservation are tempered by the fact that we  are missing an opportunity to protect  wildlife and native habitats in some of  the  few areas that have never been  farmed in this country.  Another important feature of the bill  is that we were able to secure a modified version of a revenue-based safety  net that Senator BROWN and I originally  proposed  last  summer.  The  version in the conference report allows  farmers to elect to enter into this program starting in 2009 and provides a  revenue guarantee to producers in the  program depending on market conditions and previous earnings.  It is a good step forward for Illinois  producers and for the future structure  of our commodity programs. At this  time of high prices, the program provides  producers  a  risk-management  tool they can really use.

773,205,2008-05-15,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Madam President,  with today’s passage of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, we  have taken a step in the right direction  for rural America after well over a year  of work on this bill. This legislation  will result  in new opportunities  for  U.S.  farmers, rural business owners,  and those who require food assistance  during a time of rising food prices. I  am pleased that the Senate has finally  voted in favor of its implementation.  None of this would have been possible  without the leadership of our chairman  and ranking member on the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator HARKIN  and Senator CHAMBLISS.  I want  to  thank both of their staffs and in particular Mark Halverson, majority staff  director, and Martha Scott Poindexter,  minority staff director, for their hard  work and dedication to bring this 5-  month conference to a conclusion.  For the first time in the process of  writing a  farm bill, the tax writing  committees were asked to help fund a  portion of the spending. I have strong  concerns about this, which I have expressed previously. Still, we would not  be here today without the hard work  and leadership of the chairman of the  Finance Committee, Senator MAXBAUCUS. And he is supported by a strong  staff. That starts with the Democratic  staff director on  the Finance Committee, Russ Sullivan, and the deputy  staff director, Bill Dauster, as well as  his legislative director, Jon Selib, who  were each critical to the process. I also  want to thank Brandon Willis on his  personal staff, Pat Bousilmann on the  Senate Finance Committee, and Cathy  Koch and Rebecca Baxter on his tax  staff. And I want to thank his chief  international trade counsel, Demetrios  Marantis, as well as the other members  of the Democratic trade staff, Darci  Vetter, Amber Cottle, Janis Lazda,  Chelsea Thomas, and Hun Quach, and  three individuals serving on detail to  Senator BAUCUS, Russ Ugone, Ayesha  Khanna, and Chuck Kovatch.  Of course, I am grateful for the outstanding effort of my staff as well.  First I want to thank Amanda Taylor,  my agriculture counsel on my personal  staff for her many months and countless hours of dedication and hard work  on this bill. I also want to thank my  chief tax counsel and deputy staff director, Mark Prater, as well as Elizabeth Paris, my energy and agricultural  tax counsel. I am pleased that with  their hard work we were able to provide long overdue agricultural tax relief to our nation’s farmers. In addition,  from my  trade  staff, Stephen  Schaefer,  David  Johanson,  Claudia  Poteet, and David Ross, each deserve  my thanks for their contributions. I  also want to thank John Kalitka, who  is on detail to my staff from the U.S.  Department of Commerce.  Today’s vote  is  long overdue. The  September 2007 deadline of the  farm  bill has long come and gone. The farm  bill hasn’t happened as quickly as I  would have liked, and we’ve had multiple extensions. Still, today’s vote is  critical to giving our agricultural policy a face lift.

776,212,2008-05-15,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, I send a  motion to the desk.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.  The legislative clerk read as follows:  The Senator  from New Hampshire.  [Mr.  GREGG] moves that the conferees on the part  of the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the  two Houses on the concurrent resolution S.  Con. Res. 70 (the concurrent resolution on  the budget for fiscal year 2009) be instructed  to reject the revenue levels in both the Senate-passed and the House-passed budget resolutions, both of which assume the largest tax  increase in history, and include revenue levels consistent with extension of the tax.rates  currently in place.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire  is recognized.  ",2008
777,212,2008-05-15,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, this motion to instruct is necessary because  the budget, as it left the Senate and it  is represented, has been agreed to between the House and Senate Democratic leadership and membership, with  no Republican  input other than the  courtesy of telling us what they have  agreed to, has in it the largest tax increase in the history of the world—the  history of the world, not just the history of the United States. It is a $1.2  trillion tax increase. It means that all  Americans’ taxes will go up significantly as a result of this tax increase.  Mr. President, 7.8 million people today  who do not pay taxes will find that  they are paying taxes. These are low-  and moderate-income Americans who  are not  liable to pay taxes because  their income has them in a level where  there is no tax event, but under this  budget resolution, which assumes the  termination of the tax policies that  were put in place in 2001 and 2003, those  7.8 million people will be returned to  the tax rolls and will have to pay  taxes.  Families of four, earning $50,000—a  husband, a wife and two children—in  2011, under this bill, would see their  taxes go up $2,300. A single mom raising two kids—which is the toughest job  in America,  in my opinion—earning  $30,000 a year, that mother would see  her taxes go up by $1,100. That is a lot  of food, a lot of clothing, and a lot of  better lifestyle that will be lost to that  family.  A  family of  four  earning  $110,000  would see their taxes—that would be,  for example, a mother who is teaching  or a father who is teaching and a mother who is a police officer, one making  $50,000 and one making, say, $60,000—  that family with two children could see  their taxes go up $4,300 under this bill.  Small businesses—which are defined  by the Democratic Party as the rich,  will pay more taxes. In fact right now  in the House of Representatives they  are debating a bill which they claim  taxes the rich, which it turns out are  small businesses who file as individuals—75 percent of all individual returns with income above $300,000 include business income, and 83 percent  of all individual returns with income  above $1 million include business income. They will be subject to the high-  end tax which the Democratic Party is  proposing  in  the House. Meanwhile,  small businesses, who pay 54 percent of  all  individual  income  taxes—those  small businesses, 27 million in total,  will see their tax bill go up by $4,100  under  this  budget  resolution. That  could easily put a lot of those small  businesses out of business, that type of  a tax hike. A lot of these businesses  work at the margin. Even though they  may have high income, they are still  spending a lot of that in order to maintain their business.  Elderly  couples with  incomes  of  $40,000, if the Democratic budget goes  forward, an elderly taxpayer, someone  over 65 with $40,000 of income, will see  their taxes go up $2,200. That is a lot of  money for somebody who is probably  on a fixed income and does not have  too many ways to increase their income and are trying to make  fixed  costs, which they also cannot reduce.  To be hit with a $2,200 tax bill in 2011  is a pretty stiff penalty to pay so the  party in power, the Democratic Party,  can spend their money on some program they deem more appropriate than  allowing that individual to keep their  money in their pocket. Eighteen million seniors will see taxes go up under  this bill as the tax policies of 2001 and  2003 are  repealed and  taxes are  increased.  There was an argument made on the  other side of the aisle that we are not  going to do that, we are going to collect  this money  from  uncollected  taxes. That argument has no viability  any longer. They made that argument  last year, and the amount of money  which was collected from uncollected  taxes went up a minuscule amount, so  that  argument  has  no  credibility.  There is an argument made, primarily  by Senator OBAMA in his campaign for  the Presidency, that all these new programs and all this cost will be paid for  by taxing the wealthiest Americans—  only the wealthiest Americans; that  the other tax breaks will be left in  place.  This budget does not assume that.  This budget does not assume that at  all. This budget assumes the full repeal  of all the tax rates as they were put in  place in 2001 and 2003. In addition, it assumes the  full repeal of the capital  gains rate, full repeal of the dividend  rate—which, by the way, taxes on capital gains and dividends are paid disproportionately  by  senior  citizens.  They are the ones who sell their homes  and end up with capital gains, they are  the ones who have fixed incomes usually tied to dividends from their pensions.  So that argument that this proposal  is just going to tax the wealthiest of  Americans does not fly, on the basis of  the language of the Democratic budget.  The Democratic budget says they are  going to repeal and raise, by $1.2 trillion,  those  taxes—taxes which  all  Americans will have to pay.  Senator OBAMA says if he just taxes  the wealthy, he can pay for all his new  spending programs. Those new spending programs total up to well over $300  billion a year. He has proposed over 185  new programs. If you score just 143 of  those programs he  is proposing—his  new or additional programs—it totals  $300 billion in new spending. That is on  top of the new spending already in this  budget resolution. This budget radically expands spending. It is well over  $200 billion in new discretionary spending over the 5-year period of this budget and of course you put the Obama  ‘‘spend-orama’’ on top of that and you  are up another $300 billion. All of this  is going to be paid for, allegedly, by  just taxing the wealthy.  You have to look at the language of  the bill. That is not the way it is going  to be paid for. As I outlined, it is going  to be paid for by taxing working Americans, elderly Americans, single moms  with families and individuals who run  small businesses.  In fact, if you took Senator OBAMAat  face value, and what he is proposing, he  is going to raise all of these taxes on  the wealthy to pay for his $300 billion  of new spending and the $200 billion in  this bill. The $300 billion figure is an  annual number, by the way.  The maximum amount, if you were  to return to the top rate in America,  back to the rate during the Clinton  years, which is what has been proposed  by  Senator  the maximum  amount that generates annually is $25  billion. The fact is, we will not get that  much. These are wealthy people. They  understand how to hire tax accountants and avoid taxes when taxes become disproportionate, and they view  them as  something  that  should be  avoided rather than paid.  The great advantage we have from  the tax cuts which were put in place by  President Bush and which caused this  economy to expand and caused Federal  revenues to grow in the most aggressive way  in our recent history, was  that tax laws have reached fair levels.  Take, for example, the capital gains  tax which, under this bill, under this  OBAMA,  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:39 Sep 14, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD08\RECFILES\S15MY8.REC S15MY8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008

784,219,2008-05-15,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Madam President, I  believe we should adopt Senator KYL’s  motion  to  instruct  the budget conferees. First of all, I wish to comment  on the status of the alternative minimum tax. There is some good news regarding the need to do a patch to protect  over  20 million  families. The  Democratic leadership in this body recognized the importance of halting the  effect of this tax on these families and  provided  room  in  the budget  for a  patch for this year.  I commend my friend, the chairman  of the Budget Committee, for that improvement of  the budget  resolution  over previous years. I do so again and  note that the Kyl instruction is consistent with the chairman’s position in  that regard.  The bad news  is, we are halfway  through the year and the patch has not  been done. The reason is that Blue Dog  Democrats in the other body will not  supply the votes for an un-offset patch  in the House of Representatives.  By the way, the only Blue Dog answer to deficit reduction  is to raise  taxes. We have seen it on the AMT, and  we have seen it on spending legislation.  We are seeing now the GI benefit provisions in the war supplemental bill. Why  they think of only raising taxes and  not of where to cut spending levels to  offset the need to spend someplace else  I don’t understand. They never seem to  propose spending cuts as a remedy. I  think it is fair for me to say they never  do. They only ask for higher taxes.  I hope people in this body will start  to pay attention to this issue. The Blue  Dogs’ bark  is deficit reduction, but  their bite is always more taxes.  In addition to the AMT patch, both  bodies need to deal with several expired provisions of tax law. We need to  focus on this problem and get legislation ready.  Earlier today, the House began work  on an extenders bill. It is offset with  tax increases. I urge them to send the  bill to the Senate so Chairman BAUCUS  and I will have a vehicle to deal with  this pressing problem. We need to act  ahead of time. We need to act before  the IRS forms are finalized. We cannot  go through another filing season fiasco,  such as waiting until December last  year when it finally got passed, and the  IRS had a lot of extra work after the  forms had already gone out. Let’s not  create big problems for our taxpayers  and the Internal Revenue Service.  Senator KYL’s motion then is very  important to assure us of the quickest  route to complete action on AMT and  extenders. The quickest route is the  same route as last year: Drop the offset  demand.  Folks on the other side happen to be  complaining all the time that offsets  are essential. I would like to make it  clear that the policy issues behind offsets are one thing. We ought to ask  ourselves the same question on any tax  policy proposal, whether it raises revenue or  loses revenue. The question  should be: Does a tax legislative proposal make tax policy sense? It ought  to be decided on the basis of policy.  That is the bottom line.  On the matters of tax policy, Senator  KYL’s motion to instruct, the answer is  very evident. On the AMT patch and  extenders, the answer  is overwhelmingly clear. The answer is ‘‘yes’’ on the  motion to instruct. The policy call is a  slam dunk. It is backed up by the politics; that is, supermajority votes for an  AMT patch and extenders in the House  and Senate that are very difficult to  get.  We have to divorce the merits of the  current law provisions from the offset  question. Offsets should be judged on  their merits. An AMT patch and extenders should be judged on their merits. Why should we seek divorce of the  two, some might ask. Here is the reason.  Right now, we have a budget process,  including pay-go, that is biased toward  higher  taxes and, of course, higher  spending. As evidence, take a look at  expiring spending provisions. According to the CBO, they total $1.3 trillion—a whole $1.3 trillion. That is double a permanent AMT patch  score.  That spending is not subject to pay-go.  It, unlike expiring tax provisions, is included  in  the baseline; hence,  it  is  home free. Just like the record tax increases built into this budget, so too is  a record spending increase.

795,226,2008-05-15,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. President, here we go again. The oil companies are trying to have it exactly the  way they have had it in the past. They  have developed an amendment that is  very seductive by saying that you can  have offshore drilling with the concurrence of the State if gasoline reaches $5  a gallon. What they have not told you  is that if the price of gas goes up to $5  a gallon, of which the oil companies  are making money hand over fist, they  are going to utilize that to perpetuate  the myth that they need to drill off the  coast of a State like Florida, when, in  fact, what they have not told you is  that the oil companies already have  under lease, which has not been drilled,  33 million acres offshore. The oil companies also have another 31 million  acres  onshore  that  have  not  been  drilled. And the myth that they perpetuate, now using the fright of $5-a-gallon gas, is that we have to have more  supply and therefore we have to go offshore. This is the seductive red herring  of this amendment which was offered  by a Senator whose State, Louisiana,  has a big oil industry that drills off of  Louisiana, where, in fact, there are deposits of oil. But when you get to a  State such as Florida, there have been  several dry holes, and  the geology  shows very little oil, plus we have the  adverse interests.  Now, why do we have to keep going  through this drill over and over? It is  because the oil companies are insatiable. Do we not remember what we did  just a year and a half ago, where the  oil  interests wanted to drill toward  Tampa, FL, 2 million acres? We worked  out a compromise—which wasn’t 2 million acres, it was 8.3 million acres—but  we kept it further to the south, away  from the military training and testing  area, where you cannot put oil rigs on  the surface of the water, where we have  our largest training and testing area in  the world for our U.S. military. That is  where we are training pilots for the F–  22, where we train all of the pilots for  the new Joint Strike Fighter being developed. That is where we are testing  some of the most sophisticated weapons. That is because we have the area  that is restricted airspace. As you are  shooting that live ordnance and you  are testing in your research and development of weapons systems, you cannot have oil rigs down there on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. We etched  that into law.  But here we go again. Having gone  through this and having the oil industry have 33 million acres that is already available for lease but has not  been drilled, they want to make an exception and are using the scare of this  $4 gas—maybe going to $5 gas—in order  to do that. That is wrong, and we ought  to put a stop to it.  Here is the greatest wrong it perpetuates. What it does is it keeps us in the  same old mindset where we stay married to oil. The emphasis is drill, drill,  drill to solve the problem, as evidenced  by $5 gas, when, in fact, that is not  going to solve our problem. What is  going to solve our problem is using our  technology to go to alternative fuels.  What is going to solve our problem is  to go to renewables. What is going to  solve our problem is going to be to  have a new President of the United  States who says he is going to commit  to making  the United States  independent of foreign oil, of which we now  import 60 percent for our daily consumption from places such as Nigeria,  Venezuela, and the Persian Gulf.  So what we have to do is change the  mindset of the old way of doing things,  which this amendment by the Senator  from Louisiana is suggestive of; that  is, to go to the alternative fuels, to go  to a serious research and development  program for a new engine on down the  line, to encourage the increase of miles  per gallon. In Japan, they are driving  cars that get 50 miles per gallon. In Europe, they are driving cars, on a fleet  average, that are getting in the area of  40 miles per gallon. Why can’t  the  United States—if we had the political  will—change our way of doing things as  oil guzzlers through our consumption  in our personal vehicles? We can if we  have the political will.

801,226,2008-05-15,Mr. VITTER.," Mr. President, if I can  briefly respond on my own time—and I  invite a conversation or colloquy with  the distinguished Senator from Florida—I hope the distinguished Senator  realizes that in this proposal, in order  for any offshore drilling to take place,  both the Governor and the State legislature of the host State have to say,  yes, we want it. That is an absolute requirement under this proposal. The distinguished Senator from Florida knows  Florida politics far better than I, but  based on everything I know, that is not  going to happen in Florida, including  under Republican Governors and Republican legislatures, anytime soon. So  I don’t understand why he considers  this a threat to the State of Florida,  because they are in absolute control of  their own destiny under the details of  my motion. If the Senator has a response to that simple fact, I would love  to hear it and engage in a discussion.  ",2008
802,226,2008-05-15,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am  very grateful to him for giving me this  opportunity. When it comes to the defense interests of the United States, I  think it would be folly to allow a State  legislature to impose their will with regard to the defense interests. This Senator has already given the example of  the largest testing and training area in  the world for the U.S. military, which  is the Gulf of Mexico off of Florida,  which we have prohibited in law from  being drilled.  Let’s take, for example, the Atlantic  coast of Florida. Thirty years ago, this  Senator had to oppose the Secretary of  the Interior James Watt from drilling  off the east coast. The only way this  Senator was able to beat him then was  because it finally dawned on the administration that we were launching  from the Cape Canaveral Air Force station from west to east and launching  from the Kennedy Space Center from  west to east, therefore dropping the  solid rocket boosters into the Atlantic  Ocean along with the first stages of the  expendable booster rocket out of the  Air Force station, and that, in fact, we  cannot have oil rigs down there.  So a State legislature might well not  understand and be able to impose its  will on the security interests of the  U.S. Government.  ",2008

806,233,2008-05-15,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, I rise  today in support of S.J. Res. 28, a joint  resolution  disapproving  the Federal  Communications  Commission,  FCC,  rule  relaxing  newspaper-broadcast  media cross-ownership.  Like many of my colleagues, I am  deeply  troubled by  the FCC’s  rulemaking that would allow greater consolidation of our media. The media is a  tremendous force in our society. It can  inform, educate, and entertain, as well  as nourish our democratic dialogue.  Unfortunately, the media also has less  savory powers.  In recent years, we have seen an increase in coarse and violent programming, coupled with a decrease in local  news and hardhitting journalism. To  say these trends are not in the best interest of the American people, and especially our youngest citizens, is clearly an understatement.  In addition, as corporate ownership  over  our media  grows more  concentrated, we see less and less of the  diversity of our Nation. When programming is the same from coast to coast,  our airwaves will no longer reflect the  rich mosaic of our country and our  citizens.  Such  a  landscape  should  prompt the FCC to act with an overabundance of caution, but it has not.  Five years ago,  the FCC  substantially relaxed the rules that govern  media ownership in this country. Millions of Americans contacted the FCC  to complain. The U.S. Senate voted to  support a ‘‘resolution of disapproval’’  in response to the FCC’s decision. Next,  the courts got involved, and the Third  Circuit Court of Appeals shipped the  agency’s handiwork right back to the  FCC.  In 2006, the FCC began a new rulemaking, and in November of 2007, the  Commerce Committee held a hearing  to discuss the effects of consolidation  on localism and diversity in news and  entertainment.  Over the following month, the Senate  made clear to the Commission that it  had serious concerns about the FCC’s  process and its apparent rush to issue a  new rule. But on December 18, 2007,  over the objections of Commissioners  Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein,  the FCC approved a relaxed set of ownership rules under which newspaper-  broadcast cross-ownership  is permissible in the top 20 markets.  I commend Senator DORGAN for introducing S.J. Res. 28, a joint resolution disapproving the FCC rule. I am  pleased to join him as a cosponsor of  this resolution. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting S.J.  Res. 28.  Together we can send a strong and  united message that media diversity is  clearly  in the national  interest and  that the U.S. Senate will defend that  interest with all the tools at its disposal.  ",2008
807,233,2008-05-15,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  ask that I be recorded as voting no on  S.J. Res. 28, a resolution disapproving  the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission with respect  to broadcast media ownership.  ",2008
808,233,2008-05-15,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I rise in  strong support of the resolution of disapproval of the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, recently issued  rules on media cross-ownership. I want  to commend my colleague from North  Dakota for his leadership on this most  important of  issues. This  resolution  will nullify the ill-considered and hastily-passed rules pushed through by the  FCC in December of last year.  Over the last several years, the effects of media consolidation have become extremely clear to the American  people: Less local control and community-oriented programming; less independently  produced  programming;  fewer divergent views and opinions;  fewer minority-owned broadcast  stations.  And now, the FCC has green-lighted  further media concentration by voting  to overturn a 32-year-old rule prohibiting  the  cross-ownership  of  newspapers and broadcast stations—a rule  that could impact markets in which  nearly half of  the American public  lives and works.  Put  simply,  the FCC  rule change  would harm local and independent owners and help big media owners. In particular, the change further disadvantages minority media owners. While  such owners control a mere 3 percent of  the Nation’s commercial TV stations,  as many as  90 percent of minority  media owners would be subject to these  new rules. Further consolidation will  simply reduce the number of opportunities for minorities to enter the market while putting those already in the  market more at risk of being forced  out by larger media conglomerates.  The FCC argues that this rule is necessary to ‘‘save’’ the newspaper industry. But as an  internal FCC  study  showed, despite all the stories we are  hearing  about  newspaper  cutbacks,  publicly traded newspapers earn 16 to  18 percent annual rates of return. An  internal FCC memo found the industry  as a whole to be profitable. That is to  say nothing of the fact that the FCC  has given no compelling reason for it  to be in the newspaper business in the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:39 Sep 14, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD08\RECFILES\S15MY8.REC S15MY8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008
809,240,2008-05-15,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, with  skyrocketing inflation and unemployment, riots over land reform and food  shortages, and  streams of economic  and  political  refugees  fleeing  into  neighboring  countries,  the  primary  constant in Zimbabwe over the last 30  years has been the increasingly despotic and disastrous rule of President  Robert Mugabe. A decade ago, high interest rates and  inflation galvanized  public  support  for  the Zimbabwean  Congress of Trade Unions led by Morgan Tsvangirai, who was chosen in 1999  to  lead a new opposition party—the  Movement for Democratic Change, or  MDC.  In  2002  and  2005,  President  Mugabe’s ruling ZANU–PF party rigged  Presidential and Parliamentary elections to maintain its grip on power,  and while he tried to do it again on  March 29 of this year, the MDC and the  people of Zimbabwe refused to be intimidated or outmaneuvered.  Despite  the  Zimbabwean Government’s best efforts to limit the access  of international monitors and journalists, most observers concur that the  general elections conducted this past  March  were  fraught  with  rigging,  mainly to favor the ruling ZANU–PF.  Even so, these efforts failed to silence  the  people  of Zimbabwe’s  call  for  change. After  significant and unexplained delays, the Zimbabwe Electoral  Commission announced that the MDC  had won a majority in Parliament and  that Mr. Tsvangirai won more votes for  the Presidency, but not  enough  to  avoid a runoff.  For  more  than  6  weeks  now,  Zimbabwe has been in a state of increasing political uncertainty and violence. With each passing day, there are  new reports of state-sponsored intimidation  and  detention  of  opposition  leaders and supporters, human rights  activists, trade union leaders, lawyers  and journalists. The delay in announcing and now in setting a date for the  Presidential  runoff  election has  allowed the ruling party to mobilize traditional state security services as well  as youth militias and bands of military  veterans to weaken the opposition. Mr.  Tsvangirai has agreed to participate in  a run-off election, but he is reluctant  to return to Zimbabwe, much less to  campaign, unless the government will  guarantee his security and cease its assault on his  supporters. Facing  the  prospect of another three months in  political  limbo and  social upheaval,  Zimbabwe  risks plunging  into  even  greater uncertainty and instability.  Mr. President, we can not stand by  while this disaster unfolds. President  Mugabe has been  losing  legitimacy,  both at home and abroad, for years,  isolating himself and his country to  the detriment of Zimbabwe’s citizens.  The people of Zimbabwe are calling for  change, but it will take engagement  from external actors to help them escape the devastating status quo. The  recent decision by dock workers across  southern Africa to refuse to unload a  Chinese ship carrying Zimbabwe-bound  ammunition sent a strong message, one  that  the  international  community  should echo. Public statements condemning the situation in Zimbabwe by  the newly elected President of Botswana followed on the heels of these  protests and resulted in the denial of a  port at which the Chinese ship could  dock. Decisions by other leaders in the  region to welcome Mr. Tsvangirai for a  visit have been equally important signs  of this growing political will but they  are not enough.  The MDC’s  runoff  conditions  are  more than reasonable, and should be  supported in any way possible by regional and international governments.  Given the tense environment and high  potential for politically motivated violence, a commitment to ending impunity for human rights violations and  stopping the attacks must be a top priority. Yesterday, the United Nations  representative  in Zimbabwe reported  ‘‘indications that the level of violence  is escalating . . . and could reach crisis  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:39 Sep 14, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD08\RECFILES\S15MY8.REC S15MY8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008

Mary Ellen Tolliver was born on September  1, 1915 in Richmond, Virginia; to the union of  the late Thomas Day and Georgetta Walker-  Day. Mary Ellen Day was the oldest of four  children.  On Tuesday, May 13, 2008 at 2:30 a.m.,  God called Mary Ellen Day home for she had  done her part. ‘‘Peace I leave with you, my  peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth,  give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled  neither let it be afraid’’ (John 14:27).  Mary Ellen Day moved to Pennsylvania as  a young child with her family where she attended the public school system. Mary Ellen  Day was married to John L. Toliver in 1935  and  they attended Enon Tabernacle Baptist  Church in Germantown, where she worshiped  until her passing. John and Mary Toliver never  had  children of  their own, but  considered  many  in  the community as  their own  family  and provided them with values and traditions  that will live on forever.  Mary Ellen Toliver dedicated her life to the  field of mental health. She worked as a nurse  at the Byeberry State Mental Hospital in Pennsylvania, also known as the Philadelphia State  Hospital for 40 years from where she retired.  While at Byeberry, Mary Ellen Toliver became close to and took two long-term patients  from Byeberry into her home in Germantown.  Julia and Sweeney were abandoned by their  families, but  felt at peace with Mary Ellen  Toliver. Mary Ellen Toliver shared her home  with both ladies until their passing; Julia for 24  years  and Sweeney  for  30  years.  They  brought her great joy.  Mary Ellen Toliver, was preceded in death  by her husband John L. Toliver, her brother  Sonny Day, and sister Mabel Day. Mary Ellen  Toliver leaves to cherish her lasting memories;  her sister Willeta Day, and her sister Aquilla  Laws. Mary Ellen Toliver  leaves a host of  nieces, great-nieces, nephews, great nephews, cousins, and the Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church family.  HON.

811,254,2008-05-15,Mr. BONNER.," Madam Speaker,  it  is with  great pride and pleasure that I rise to honor  the  long and distinguished career of Tom  Hamby, on the occasion of his retirement from  AT&T Inc.  A native of Social Circle, Georgia, Tom  earned a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering at the University of Georgia. He was  commissioned in the Army Corps of Engineers  and went on to serve 10 years in the reserves  and National Guard.  As  the Birmingham News described Tom,  he  is  ‘‘one of Birmingham’s most  influential  business  leaders.’’ With a career spanning  over 37 years, Tom has served in various assignments in the network, marketing, and regulatory departments in Georgia, Alabama, and  Washington, DC, and he was appointed to his  current position, AT&T president—Alabama, in  1999.  In  the early 1990s, Tom  led  the effort  to  bring caller identification and voice mail products to customers. During his tenure as president,  the Alabama Legislature passed  landmark telecommunication legislation, which led  to greater competition,  investment, customer  choice as well as new services.  Tom is also well-known in Birmingham and  throughout the State of Alabama as a leader  in both  the business and civic communities.  He  is  chairman of  the board of  the Birmingham Museum of Art and the Greater Alabama Council of Boy Scouts of America. He is  a past chairman of Birmingham’s Metropolitan  Development Board, the Business Council of  Alabama,  and  the  Birmingham  Regional  Chamber of Commerce. He is a current director on the boards of Protective Life Corp. and  the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me  in  recognizing a dedicated  community  leader and  friend  to many  throughout  the  State of Alabama. I know his family; his wife,  Wyona; and his many friends join me in praising his accomplishments and extending thanks  for his service over the years on behalf of the  city of Birmingham and the State of Alabama.  Tom will surely enjoy the well deserved time  he now has to spend with family and his first  grandchild, who  is due  this summer.  I wish  him the best of luck in all of his future endeavors.  HONORING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF  HELEN MYERS  HON. JERRY McNERNEY  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 15, 2008  ",2008
812,254,2008-05-15,Mr. MCNERNEY.," Madam Speaker, I ask my  colleagues to join me in honoring Mrs. Helen  Myers as  the Brentwood Chamber of Commerce’s Citizen of the Year. Helen is an extraordinary woman whose entrepreneurial endeavors, generous spirit, and deep commitment to the residents of Brentwood will benefit  our community for generations to come.  One  of  seven  children, Helen’s  father  passed away when she was only five years  old. To support her family during this time of  need, she began selling produce  from her  mother’s vegetable garden to neighbors. This  entrepreneurial spirit carried  into her adulthood, and she is now a successful small business owner of both Irene’s Dress Shop and  The Weathervane.  The only child in her family to graduate from  high school, Helen went on  to marry Bill  Myers. Together they moved to California, and  eventually settled in Brentwood in 1968 with  their two children, Corky and Sherry.  Soon after moving  to Brentwood, Helen  joined the East Contra Costa Chapter of the  Soroptimists International Club, of which she  has proven to be both a valuable member and  a tireless volunteer. She has not only been instrumental in raising funds for various community projects, she has also served on numerous boards and commissions,  including  the  Delta Hospital Board, the City’s Art Commission, and the Art Society Board.  Helen’s friends and family describe her as  someone who is always looking out for others.  As an example of her kindness, friends often  tell the story of the time Helen caught a young  woman shoplifting in one of her stores. After  soon learning the woman was homeless and  living out of her car with her young child,  Helen decided against calling the police, and  instead provided  the woman with  food and  clothing and contacted a social service agency  to assist her with housing. A few weeks later,  the young woman returned to Helen, thanked  her for her compassion, and reimbursed her  for the food and the clothing.  A woman who has given so much  to her  community, Helen has done so quietly and  without  fanfare, making her selection as  the  Brentwood Chamber of Commerce’s Citizen of  the Year all the more worthy of public recognition. From her countless hours as a volunteer,  to her success as a small business owner,  Helen has touched the lives of many and has  improved  the  community of Brentwood  for  years to come.  It  is  for  these reasons  that  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Helen Myers,  Brentwood Chamber of Commerce’s Citizen of  the Year.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

813,261,2008-05-15,Ms. NORTON.," Madam Speaker, as another  presidential election  fast approaches,  I am  pleased to introduce a bill to amend and improve  the Help America Vote Act of 2002,  HAVA, which was enacted after the chaos of  the 2000 presidential election. The genesis of  my bill is my own experience and observations  from the 2004 elections here in the District of  Columbia and campaigning in other parts of  the country during the 2004 presidential elections.  The first provision is in response to the long  lines that voters have been forced to endure  throughout the country that may have deterred  significant numbers of voters and would require States to permit counties or other subdivisions upon request to begin voting prior to  the scheduled date of an election. During the  2004 election, some subdivisions had voting  machines  that were modern and plentiful,  while other  jurisdictions  in  the same State  were burdened with scarce and out-of-date  machines, resulting in long lines. In the pivotal  state of Ohio, which determined the outcome  of  the close 2004 presidential election,  the  controversy was deepened by  reports  that  lines were particularly long in counties where  there were  large minority populations compared with largely white counties. One reason  for the difference is that in many States, voting  machines are purchased by counties or other  jurisdictions. Differences in income levels, tax  bases and other issues often result in large  disparities within the same State in the availability of machines. Small changes in the calendar day that voting begins can help eliminate these disparities and the lines that discourage the exercise of the right to vote, and  without the often significant capital investment  in new equipment.  The second provision of my bill adds a section to HAVA that responds to calls my office  received  regarding absentee ballots sent  in  that inadvertently did not include postage, or  had insufficient postage. My bill would require  officials to accept such absentee ballots. Postage mistakes may be made depending on the  number of issues on the ballot and the resulting size and weight of the envelope containing  the ballot. The cost to authorities, if any, is de  minimis. The public interest in counting every  ballot voters have cast outweighs  the  incidental, virtually  immeasurable cost,  if any.  There should be no doubt  that such ballots  should be counted.  A third provision amends HAVA to eliminate  the confusion  that arises when voters go  to  the  incorrect voting sites because  they are  first-time or  infrequent voters or  their usual  voting site has been changed. To encourage  participation, my bill would allow voters registered anywhere in the State to cast a provisional ballot and have it counted and verified.  However, voters would be told the correct polling site to allow the option of going to the correct site and thereby avoiding any doubt that  their ballots would be counted.  The 2000 presidential election was a calamity of such historic proportions  that  it cast  doubt on  the validity of  the election of  the  President of the United States and led to the  enactment of HAVA. The continuing problems  in the 2004 elections were very serious, unacceptable,  and  controversial. Although  that  election was also razor thin close, its problems  took longer to surface and there was no delay  in the certification and settlement of the final  result through the Supreme Court in Bush v.  Gore  in 2001. However,  the 2004 elections  were another close call that yielded bitter controversy. Beyond the recent election controversies, the voting franchise is precious enough  for us to want and endeavor to protect its full  expression. Congress must be willing to learn  from our continuing experience  to make  improvements in protecting the right to vote as  they are needed. My bill simply uses the experience from my own district and elsewhere to  contribute to this effort.  f  CONCERN ABOUT TREATMENT OF  U.S. CITIZEN IN BELARUSIAN DETENTION  HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 15, 2008  ",2008
814,261,2008-05-15,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Madam Speaker,  as Chairman of the Commission on Security  and Cooperation  in Europe,  I would  like  to  draw attention and concern to the case of Mr.  Emanuel Zeltser, a U.S. citizen who was detained March 12th upon his arrival in Minsk,  Belarus, charged with  ‘‘use of  forged documents.’’ In the entire time that Mr. Zeltser has  been detained, he has only been allowed visitation by the U.S. Embassy twice, on March  21st and April 25th. Upon the latter visit it was  noted by the U.S. consul that Mr. Zeltser had  been beaten several  times and appeared  in  greatly weakened health. Mr. Zeltser suffers  from Type 2 diabetes and a severe form of arthritis. Though his condition causes him severe pain and has further deteriorated during  his incarceration, the authorities in the detention facility where he is held have reportedly  denied him necessary medications. Without  proper medications, Mr. Zeltser may not be  able to survive the harsh conditions of his detention. Furthermore, according to his lawyer,  Belarusian authorities have recently extended  the period of Mr. Zeltser’s term of detention.  It is incumbent upon the Belarusian government to provide Mr. Zeltser full consular access, proper medical care, and ensure that he  is not subjected to further physical abuse and  degrading treatment—consistent with its international  legal obligations and basic human  rights standards.  Time is of the essence in Mr. Zeltser’s case,  as further delays could lead to further deterioration of his health to the point of endangering  his life.  Madam Speaker, I call upon the Belarusian  authorities  to ensure  that Mr. Zeltser  immediately receives the medication his doctor has  prescribed, and  is protected  from  further  ill-  treatment, given access to U.S. consular representatives and any medical attention he may  need. On April 25, the State Department requested the Government of Belarus to release  Emanuel Zeltser on humanitarian grounds.  I  urge the Belarusian Government to favorably  consider that request.  f  CELEBRATING TAYLOR’S 40TH  ANNIVERSARY  HON. JOHN D.

Incorporated as a city on May 13, 1968,  and named after our country’s 12th president,  Taylor’s roots as a community date to the mid-  19th Century. What began as a largely agricultural town grew into a prosperous and diverse  city which features ample retail and industry  for employment and safe neighborhoods  for  her citizens.  Taylor first began as a Township when residents succeeded  in petitioning  for  their own  government  in 1847. Like many Michigan  communities, Taylor began  to  thrive when  Ford Motor Company  opened  the  nearby  Rouge Plant. The Rouge, as it was often simply called, provided over 100,000 jobs at one  time during the 1930s. This mighty economic  engine created a boom in the burgeoning town  that would carry it through the Great Depression and World War II, during which it played  an invaluable part of the American war effort.

Dale Engquist has been with  the National  Park Service for 19 years. He has proven his  leadership skills  through developing partnerships and cooperative programs and providing  collaborative opportunities  for a diverse and  complex audience. During Mr. Engquist’s extensive career with the National Park Service,  he  increased  the  lakeshore at  the  Indiana  Dunes by 15 percent and developed an educational program that serves over 35,000 students each year at the Paul Douglas Center  for Environmental Education. Mr. Engquist is  also  responsible  for  the partnership  formed  between  local  community  governments,  LaPorte County, and the State of Indiana that  collaborated  to build a new visitor center,  which is set to increase contacts with visitors  to the area by 500 percent.  Mr. Engquist’s vision and passion led to the  development of a network of community organizations, state agencies, and environmental  organizations  to  combat  invasive  species,  which have been a pervasive problem along  the southern tip of Lake Michigan. His participation on the Executive Steering Committee of  the Chicago Wilderness greatly increased the  awareness of the region to the biologically diverse and sensitive nature of  the  Indiana  Dunes. Mr. Engquist has also signed a sister  park  agreement with Kampinoski National  Park of Poland, formally providing opportunities for each park to meet and exchange ideas  and information about resource management  and education.  Due  to his extended commitment  to both  residents and visitors to Indiana’s Second District, it is my pleasure to rise today to honor  Dale Engquist for receiving the Distinguished  Service Award for his long and accomplished  career with the National Park Service.  f  NATIONAL TRAIN DAY  SPEECHOF  HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 13, 2008  ",2008
817,268,2008-05-15,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  express my support of H. Res. 1176, Supporting the goals and ideals of National Train  Day, as a Member who appreciates and recognizes the vital role of trains in our economy  and as a passenger who commutes between  New York and Washington, DC, on the Amtrak  Acela. I find my commute by train a convenient, efficient and relaxing way to travel that  enables me to read and work in comfort and  arrive refreshed, usually on time, and downtown, closer to my destination. I praise the efforts of visionary leaders who over the years  have advocated  the preservation and modernization of passenger rail service.  Trains have played a vital and historic role  in  this country,  transporting cargo and passengers since  the early 19th century, when  the first steam locomotive was built by engineer George Stephenson. Without the creation  of the steam engine, the Industrial Revolution  would not have occurred and our great country would not have been able to prosper as  much as  it has.  In 1869,  the  first  transcontinental railroad was completed. Known as  the ‘golden pike,’ it connected both the east  and west coast of the United States, linking  our Nation and bridging the geographical divide like never before.  Although  there are a greater number of  modes  of  transportation—planes,  cars,  buses—than  there were  in  the early 1800s,  trains are still  relied on  to  transport  large  amounts of freight and millions of people everyday. They have  reduced  congestion  in  major cities, helping to reduce pollution connecting people in rural areas to urban centers.  The history of trains has come a long way,  from burning coal and going only 130 km/h to  high-speed trains that can go from 200 km/h  to 350 km/h and are electrically driven by  overhead cables. Trains are constantly changing and improving. Due to global warming and  greenhouse effects, trains now run more fuel  efficiently, emitting only 0.2 percent of  the  travel industry’s total greenhouse gases.  I support National Train Day because  the  train industry has been an important part of  America’s story and  its economic development, as well as a large part of Americans’  day-to-day lives.  f  TRIBUTE TO HARVEY SCHECTER  HON.

They are  being honored at  the 7th Annual Hillel 818  Dinner Celebration for their generous support  and outstanding contributions to Los Angeles  Valley College and to our community.  I have had  the pleasure of working with  Hope and Harvey  throughout  the years on  many important issues of concern to the San  Fernando Valley, the State of California and  our Nation. I value their counsel, respect their  knowledge and appreciate the help they have  given me in my career.  Harvey is a remarkable individual who has  dedicated his life to protecting our civil rights  and combating anti-Semitism and racial discrimination. From 1952, when he began his  impressive career with  the Anti-Defamation  League (ADL), until 1993 when he retired as  Western States Regional Director of the ADL  Foundation, he has been at the forefront on  critical humanitarian issues of concern to the  ADL, the Jewish community and the world at  large. Harvey has been a mentor, confidant,  friend, teacher and inspiration to others during  his career. His speeches, writings, and incomparable wit have enriched all who have had  the good fortune to know him.  Following Harvey’s retirement from the ADL,  he rediscovered the joy of learning at Los Angeles Valley College. He touched the lives of  hundreds of students as he shared with them  the knowledge he has gained in his 84 years.  Hope  is an outstanding example of  the  American dream. Born in a small mining town  in Arizona to Mexican-American parents who  spoke no English, she overcame tremendous  challenges  to achieve great success. After  dropping out of high school, she worked at  menial  jobs,  including as an underpaid garment industry worker. Her personal experience  with the injustices to unskilled workers led her  to a career as a union organizer for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. She  helped improve the quality of life for hundreds  of workers by her determination, positive attitude and resilience. Her career includes many  significant contributions to our community, including Community Service Organizer, fighting  for safe neighborhoods, establishing the first  Head Start Operation in Los Angeles County,  helping resolve racial issues as a member of  the Board of Directors of the Council of Mexican American Affairs and many more. She became a Certified Court Reporter, established  her own firm and was the first woman elected  President of the General Court Reporters Association. During my brief period in law practice, Hope was my court reporter of choice.  Beyond her community contributions, Hope  has been a valuable asset  to  the California  Democratic Party, serving for many years on  the California Democratic State Central Committee in a number of leadership positions and  volunteering her time and efforts to numerous  political  campaigns. Hope’s dedication and  tireless efforts on behalf of our community are  an inspiration to us all.  Hope and Harvey  recently celebrated 53  years of a wonderful marriage. Although they  have no children of their own, they have been  ‘‘adopted’’ as parents by more than one hundred young people they have met on the campus and in the community.  I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me  in honoring  two special people who’s caring  and contributions have benefited so many.  f  THE NEW RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT  HON.

820,275,2008-05-15,Mr. CRENSHAW.," Madam Speaker, I would  like  to recognize and honor all  law enforcement officials for the crucial and irreplaceable  job that they so tirelessly do for our communities’ benefit. When I meet with various officials  throughout my district and see  the  job  that  they do,  I am continually  impressed by  the sense of honor and the level of commitment with which  they so unselfishly serve.  Many of them continually place their lives on  the line in order to protect the families and individuals in our area. Some have indeed given  their lives in the line of duty, and for that there  is no measure of gratitude that can possibly  rise to the level of what our community owes  them.  These dedicated  individuals give of  their  time, energy, and heart. They ask  for  little  other than our support. They crave no spotlight or public applause. They serve out of a  sense of deep love for their community and  out of a sense of purpose in ensuring the citizenry is protected and justice is served.  I would like to especially recognize a fallen  officer whose name was added to the wall on  the National Police Memorial in Washington,  D.C.  this week,  in a ceremony attended by  Jacksonville Sheriff Rutherford.  Jacksonville Sheriff’s Officer Eric Bell was  killed, on duty, on October 12, 2007 when a  vehicle pulled in front of his patrol car. Officer  Bell was returning from a call on Heckscher  Drive when a van  traveling on New Berlin  Road collided with his cruiser.  Officers like Eric Bell embody the belief that  there is no greater purpose than serving our  fellow neighbors, and Officer Bell gave his life  in this noble effort. In doing so, he and other  law enforcement officials model character and  integrity for generations to come.  It is with a grateful heart and a sense of tremendous pride  that  I  recognize and honor  Jacksonville Sheriff’s Officer Eric Bell and  each individual serving our community in a law  enforcement capacity during  this 2008 National Law Enforcement Week.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

The Annual Ohio Business Women’s Conference  is  the  largest event of  its kind  for  women  in business and provides business  owners with  the  information and  tools necessary to expand their market. The theme for  this year’s conference is ‘‘Bridging Success’’  and will  feature over  five hundred women  business owners, entrepreneurs and corporate  exhibitors. The mission, put forth by the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce for Ohio and the  Hispanic Business Association is to promote  women  business  enterprises  through  all  stages of development. This unique and important event provides women business owners with  the  forum  to display  their products  and services to America’s leading corporations  and government agencies, who join the conference from across the nation as sponsors,  exhibitors, and attendees. This year’s event  will provide women business owners and entrepreneurs with networking activities, workshops, panel discussions, and matchmaking  procurement sessions.  I also stand in recognition of the Hispanic  Business Association (HBA) for their contributions and  leadership  in promoting and supporting women business owners in the Greater  Cleveland Area. The Hispanic Business Association grew out of the vision of local Hispanic  business owners in 1981 who were startled by  the low participation of the Hispanic community in the private and public sector. Since its  official  incorporation as a nonprofit  in 1983,  the HBA has worked  to  fulfill  its mission of  promoting Hispanic business  interest and  its  economic development and expansion through  strategic  partnerships,  technical  assistance  and advocacy.  Madam Speaker and colleagues, please join  me in recognition of this year’s Annual Ohio  Business Women’s Conference and Expo as  well as in recognition of the Hispanic Business  Association  for  their diverse and extensive  service to business owners and entrepreneurs  in the Greater Cleveland Area.  f  THE DAILY 45: SALVADORAN IMMIGRANT FAMILY’S MURDER SUICIDE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 15, 2008  Mrs. WILSON  of New Mexico.

822,275,2008-05-15,Mr. RUSH.," Madam Speaker, every day,  somewhere in America, an average of 45 people are shot and killed at the hands of a gun-  wielding assailant. This senseless loss of life  comes  in all shapes, sizes, colors and zip  codes. And, far too often, death comes at the  hands of a loved one.  According to law enforcement authorities, on  May 10th in Houston, Texas, death came at  the hands of a Salvadoran immigrant husband  and father of three young children. Neighbors  describe, the father, Salvador, as friendly and  hard-working. For reasons we’ll never know,  Salvador took a rifle and shot his wife, Lupe,  and their three children, all under the age of  10. Before he shot himself, Salvador  left a  Snoopy doll and other plush animals along  with a note that read, ‘‘May God Have Mercy.’’  So many dreams cut short in an instant of despair.  We must stop  the senseless murders of  ‘‘The Daily 45.’’ When will Americans say  ‘‘Enough is enough, stop the killing!’’  f  IN RECOGNITION OF WHISKEY  ISLAND  HON. DENNIS J.

823,275,2008-05-15,Mr. KUCINICH.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today in recognition of Whiskey Island, a natural beauty along Lake Erie’s urban coastline  near Downtown Cleveland. On Saturday May  17, 2008, our Cuyahoga County Commissioners will be dedicating the Whiskey Island  Bridge so that the people will have better access to Whiskey Island. Whiskey Island is a  magnificent natural asset at the mouth of the  Cuyahoga River in Downtown Cleveland. This  lakefront park  is not only an environmental  asset, but an amenity  for people who  live,  work, and play in Downtown Cleveland.  The Cuyahoga County Commissioners were  visionary in having acquired this park for the  people of Northeast Ohio. I join with the Commissioners  in envisioning a day when  the  Towpath Trail, which links our state’s history,  culture, nature, and geography along 110  miles between New Philadelphia and Cleveland, will connect with Lake Erie at Whiskey  Island. With our continued stewardship of this  important natural resource, Whiskey Island will  one day be linked by this pedestrian and bicycle trail through Akron and Canton along the  Cuyahoga River and its historic Towpath.  Whiskey Island and the Towpath Trail are  the people’s treasures. With the dedication of  the  improved Whiskey  Island Bridge, more  people may now enjoy  this oasis along  the  shoreline of Lake Erie and the banks of the  Cuyahoga River.  I  have  supported  these  projects in the past and pledge my future support to preserve and protect them as the people’s resources.  Madam Speaker, please join me in this moment to reflect on the beauty of Whiskey Island and the will of the people of Northeastern  Ohio to protect this important patch of nature  for  the  people’s  continued  enjoyment.  <P>Madam Speaker and colleagues, please  join me in recognition of Whiskey Island, and  the will of the people of Northeastern Ohio to  protect this important patch of nature for the  people’s continued enjoyment.

824,4,2008-05-23,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Speaker, Employers who misclassify their employees as independent contractors  rob workers of needed  pay and benefits and cost government at all  levels substantial uncollected  revenues—resources that are needed for vital government  programs and services.  Yet misclassification is widespread. According to the General Accounting Office, at least  10 million workers in the U.S. are classified as  independent contractors, and studies show  that as many as 30 percent of employers  misclassify their workers. Why do they do it?  They misclassify to avoid the cost of payroll  taxes,  insurance  premiums  and mandated  benefits, and to boost their profits. In fact, the  Department of Labor has concluded that the  number one reason for misclassification is to  avoid  the payment of workers compensation  premiums, as well as workplace injury and disability-related disputes.  The cost is high for employees, who when  misclassified, lose out on employee benefits,  including those that are exempt from taxation  or receive tax-deferred benefits, such as retirement,  life  insurance, accident and health  coverage, qualified tuition reduction programs,  benefits under a cafeteria plan, educational  assistance programs and dependent care assistance programs. Additionally misclassified  workers are not afforded even minimal workforce  protections,  including workers  compensation, minimum wage,  overtime  pay,  health and safety requirements and the right  to join a union. And eligibility for Medicare, Social Security and Unemployment compensation is negatively affected as well.  The cost to society is high as well, and it is  estimated that billions of dollars are lost each  year; money that would otherwise be paid to  the States and  the Federal Government  in  taxes. Despite,  this enormous problem,  the  Department of Labor (DOL) has failed not only  to crack down on  this practice by enforcing  current laws, but has failed to coordinate with  other agencies to address the issue. In addition, it is unclear under the law which standard  should be employed  for determining who  is  and who is not an independent contractor.  The Employee Misclassification Prevention  Act of 2008, which Representatives ANDREWS,  MICHAUD, MILLERand I are introducing today  attacks the problem of misclassification head-  on by:  Clarifying  that employee  records must  reflect the worker’s accurate status or classification as an employee or non-employee and that  it is a violation of the Act to make an inaccurate classification.  Requiring employers to provide employees  and non-employees notice of their status and  notice of their rights to challenge that classification.  Providing  additional  penalties  for  misclassification as well as  increased penalties for violations that are willful or repeated.  Requiring  state  unemployment  insurance  agencies to conduct audits to identify employers who are misclassifying employees.  Mandating the Department of Labor (DOE)  to develop a system  to  track and monitor  States’ effectiveness in identifying employers  who misclassify.  Explicitly allowing DOL and  the  Internal  Revenue Service (IRS)  to refer  incidents of  misclassification to one another; and  Requiring DOL  to perform  targeted audits  focusing on employers in industries that frequently misclassify employees.  We know that there are good employers out  there who pay their employees fair and honest  wages. This bill is to protect bona fide employees from the 30 percent who don’t.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON.

ANDREWS  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  MIKE LYNN  along  MICHAUD,  Wednesday, May 21, 2008  ",2008
825,4,2008-05-23,Mr. ANDREWS.," Madam Speaker,  with my  colleagues Congresswoman  WOOLSEY, Chairman GEORGEMILLER, Congressman  Congressman  MCDERMOTTand almost all of the Democratic  Members of the Committee on Education and  Labor, I rise today to introduce the Employee  Misclassification  Prevention  Act  of  2008,  EMPA.  The  egregious  practice  of misclassifying  workers as independent contractors needs to  end. EMPA  is pro-employee, pro-employer  and pro-taxpayer. The bill will protect employee benefits, remove incentives for employers  to misclassify  their workers, and ensure  that bad employers don’t line their own pockets with unpaid payroll taxes.  In the last decade we have seen a questionable  increase  in  the amount of  individuals  classified as independent contractors. In 1984,  which was  the  last  time a comprehensive  misclassification study was conducted by an  oversight agency on  this  issue,  the  Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) estimated that 15 percent of employers misclassified 3.4 million  workers as independent contractors. As a result, $1.6 billion or $2.72 billion in inflation-adjusted 2006 dollars in Social Security, unemployment and income taxes was stripped from  the hands of the Government and went into  the pockets of tax evaders. Furthermore, the  3.4 million workers who were misclassifed  were stripped of many of their basic, but essential, employee rights.  In some cases, classifying an individual as  an  independent contractor  is quite right and  quite appropriate. If someone is retained for a  limited purpose, usually for a limited time, to  do a specific job function for an employer, it is  quite necessary and appropriate that that person not be treated as an employee for reasons of flexibility, and for reasons of fair compensation.  However, when an individual is considered  an independent contractor by their employer,  but is told what to do. has no discretion over  how  to conduct  the affairs of  the business,  and whose compensation is fixed and set by  the employer,  it  is our duty as Members of  Congress  to protect  this employee’s  rights  under Federal law.  There are millions of workers, who mow  lawns, drive trucks, work in garment linen factories, and serve  food  in  restaurants  that  I  would  consider an employee; nonetheless,  these hardworking  individuals are exploited  and misclassified by their employers seeking  to evade paying taxes. If any American worker  is told what to do, when to do it, how much  money they are going to make, what the work  rules are, what  they can and cannot do by  their employer  then  the  law should  require  they be classified as an employee and receive  all of the benefits of the 40-hour work week,  as well as worker safety protections, pension  and healthcare protections and other worker  protections provided  to  them under Federal  law.  I encourage everyone  to  join me, my cosponsoring colleagues, as well as  the AFL–  CIO. Change  to Win, United Brotherhood of  Carpenters,  International  Brotherhood  of  Teamsters, the Laborers International, UNITE  HERE, the National Employment Law Project,  and others and support EMPA to protect workers across  the country  from employers who  are only interested in making a profit for themselves at the expense of the American workers and taxpayer.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON.

A celebration is planned for May 22 to recognize her  work and contributions to Flint area youth.  Connie Rau’s work with  the  community  began  long before Flint Community Schools  employed her. From 1975 to 1985 she was a  senior therapist with the substance abuse program at Flint Osteopathic Hospital. She became a program manager at  Insight Outpatient Chemical Dependency Clinic and then  became the director of Children and Adolescent Services with the Genesee County Commission on Substance Abuse Services. It was  during  this  time  that Connie also started  to  write a column  in  the Flint Journal entitled  ‘‘Considering Kids’’ and she was an instructor  at Mott Community College. She also was an  intern field supervisor for several area universities.  As  a member  of  the  Flint Community  Schools Youth Projects staff, Connie has had  tremendous  impact on  the children of Flint.  She was  instrumental  in organizing several  programs that directly benefited the most vulnerable children  in  the Flint school system.  She coordinates two intervention programs for  the Genesee County Family Court, the Youth  Projects Diversion and the Youth Projects Diversion—Attendance Court. She established  the ‘‘Roast and Toast’’ fundraiser for student  activities, She established the ‘‘Shoes that Fit’’  Flint Chapter,  the Language Exchange program, and  the Teen Female Expo. Working  with Quota  International  of  Flint, Connie  launched the Cops and Kids program.  Recognized by the Woodrow Stanley Foundation for her work with children, Connie is a  co-founder of the Mayor’s Committee for National Youth Service Day recognizing the thousands of Community service hours the youth  of Flint have contributed to improving the quality of life in their hometown.  In addition to her work with children, Connie  is active in Peace Lutheran Church, at various  times she has held the positions of Director of  Education, Director of Finance, and currently  is Director of Stewardship. She  is on  the  Board of Directors for the Intake, Assessment  and Referral Center and she is a mentor in  the Big Brother, Big Sisters Lunch Buddies  program.  Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to rise with me and applaud the  work of Constance Rau as she retires  from  the Flint Community Schools. She has spent  her life devoted to children and has enriched  their lives through her work. All will miss her  insight,  innovative spirit and enthusiasm  for  her work and community.

833,25,2008-05-23,Mr. FARR.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  honor Brian Foss in his retirement as the Port  Director of the Santa Cruz Port District. Brian  served the Port District for 34 years, managing  Santa Cruz Harbor, as well as the Santa Cruz  Port.  After  graduating  from  the University  of  Southern California in 1964, Brian spent the  next 22 years serving as a pilot for the United  States Coast Guard, and as a Lieutenant  Colonel Combat Rescue Pilot for the California  Air National Guard Rescue. During his  time  working as a rescue pilot. Brian earned two air  medals and one Coast Guard Commendation  medal.  In 1977, Brian ended his career as a pilot,  and moved  to  Santa Cruz  to work  as  Harbormaster for the Santa Cruz Port District.  Brian’s upbeat attitude and  friendliness with  coworkers gained him many  friends, and 2  years later, Foss worked his way up to Port  Director for the Santa Cruz Port District. For  the next 31 years, Foss continued his tenure  as Port Director, serving as the Chief Executive Officer for the District.  Outside of work, Brian was, and still is, a  passionate and active  supporter of ocean  preservation. Brian was the former Chairman  of the California Marine Affairs and Navigation  Conference, a 35-year-old California port and  harbor advocacy association. Today, he is a  member of  the Bay Planning Coalition,  the  California Marine Parks and Harbors Association, and he  is a harbor  representative  for  Santa Cruz County Inter-Agency Task Force  on economic development  relevant  to  the  Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.  But Brian’s enthusiasm is not limited to the  oceans, but extends into his personal life as  well. As a devoted father, Brian founded the  129th for Kids fund, a benefit program for military children who have lost parents in service.  His dedication to the harbor and passion for  life also extended to his employees. His coworkers described him as a fun, considerate,  and polite guy to hang around, who made a  difference  in  the  lives of others; he always  made sure to let everyone feel welcome and  to have a say in decisions. Additionally, Brian  taught many of his workers how to effectively  work in public service, and always made sure  to try to do the right thing for everyone.  Madam Speaker, I would like to extend our  Nation’s deep gratitude for Brian’s service to  the United States and his local community. I  know I speak for every Member of Congress  in expressing my bittersweet feelings towards  his  retirement, and our  thankfulness  for his  contributions to our Nation. Though Brian Foss  may be  retiring, he will not be  leaving  the  hearts of all whom he has touched.  f  HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE  OF MR. ROD COOK  HON. THADDEUS G.

834,25,2008-05-23,Mr. MCCOTTER.," Madam Speaker, today I  rise to honor and acknowledge Mr. Rod Cook,  the City Manager of South Lyon, upon his retirement  from a prominent 25-year career  in  public service.  Mr. Cook accepted the position of City Manager in October of 1983, and led the citizens  of South Lyon with confidence and pride for  over  two decades. Rod was known  for his  stern, quiet demeanor and his ability to listen  intently  and make  superior  decisions. Mr.  Cook took on the challenge of city manager at  a  time when  the population was only 5,200  people. Rod was able to establish growth within the city; more than doubling the population  before his retirement. During his career, Mr.  Cook also spearheaded  road  improvements  throughout the area; launched the identity of  South Lyon; assisted with the creation of the  Rail Trail; and played an essential role in the  revitalization of the downtown area.  Rod Cook, through his proactive measures,  made South Lyon one of the fastest growing  small communities in the nation during his career. As Mr. Cook enters the next phase of his  life after his retirement on March 11, 2008, Mr.  Cook looks forward to spending time with his  wife, Sydney. Constantly showing his love for  the city, Mr. Cook will continue to contribute  his services, after retirement, until a new manager is hired.  Madam Speaker, for 25 years Mr. Rod Cook  has successfully served the citizens of South  Lyon, Michigan. As Mr. Cook resigns from his  position of City Manager, he leaves behind a  long-standing legacy of trust, dedication, and  achievement. Today, I ask my colleagues to  join me in congratulating Mr. Rod Cook upon  his  retirement and  recognizing his years of  loyal service to the community and our country.  f  HONORING  THE  40TH  ANNIVERSARY OF THE EXETER AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION  HON. JIM GERLACH  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 22, 2008  ",2008
835,25,2008-05-23,Mr. GERLACH.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay tribute and offer congratulations  to the Exeter Ambulance Association, located  in Exeter Township, Pennsylvania,  for celebrating its 40th Anniversary this year. Association members will be acknowledging this great  milestone on May 31, 2008 at an event to be  held at Association headquarters.  The Exeter Ambulance Association was  formed 40 years ago  to provide outstanding  emergency  ambulance  service  for  Exeter  Township and St. Lawrence, Pennsylvania.  The group was formed as a non-profit organization and started as an all-volunteer service.  Over the years, it has grown and expanded its  services and now provides Advanced Life  Support (ALS), Basic Life Support (BLS), and  other emergency and non-emergency ambulance services. In addition, the Exeter Ambulance Association operates a community training center and,  in 2007,  trained over 2500  people  in  CPR  and  put  30  Automatic  Defibrillators (AEDs) into service in the community. Today, the Association employs over  50 medical transportation professionals, operates  four ambulances,  two wheelchair-vans,  and responds to over 4,000 calls for help each  year.  Its mission is ‘‘to provide quality pre-hospital  emergency medical care  in both emergency  and non-emergency settings, and perform all  services related to emergency medical service  and  emergency management.’’ As  anyone  who has received assistance from the Exeter  Ambulance Association will tell you, it has performed  its mission  in an exemplary  fashion  and consistently surpasses its own standards.  At the 40th year celebration on May 31, the  Association will be joined by representatives of  the Exeter Police K–9 unit, Drive 25-Stay Alive  program, Reiffton and Stonersville Fire Departments, The PennStar Helicopter and  flight  team, Berks County Humane Society, American Red Cross and Aquabilities of Birdsboro,  PA. In addition, St Joseph’s Hospital will provide  blood  pressure  checks,  cholesterol  screening, and bone density screening and  the Reading Phillies mascot  ‘‘Screwball’’ will  make an appearance. It will be a fitting celebration to recognize all of the members’ great  work.  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues  join me today in praising the courageous work,  dedication and service of the men and women  that make up the Exeter Ambulance Association. The employees and volunteers continue  to protect their community with steadfast determination, and ensure that when one is in  trouble, they will be there to help.

I was proud  to  award  the Congressional Medal of Merit  to  these students during a ceremony at Michigan’s State Capitol on May 9, 2008.  These graduating seniors were nominated  by their schools for the prestigious Congressional Medal of Merit. To be nominated, each  student demonstrated exemplary citizenship  and academic excellence throughout their high  school careers.  These young men and women have demonstrated an outstanding sense of service to  their peers, education and community. Honoring  their achievements with  the Congressional Medal of Merit is a privilege and I congratulate each of  them along with  their parents,  family,  teachers and community. Together, this group of students represents the  best  and  brightest America  has  to  offer:  Amber Barber, Tyler Bengel, Kristin Boozer,  Michael Brendel, Sarah Bush, Chris Case,  Kaitlyn Charette, Christina Clarke, Bethany  Davis, Nathan Feldpausch, Preston Frazier,  Mariah Frey, Brittney Fuller, Kristy Gould,  Effrem Grettenberger, Carolyn Hamilton, Robert Hindy, Jessica Holberg, Priya Karve, Jason  Klepal, Kristin Kotarba, Audrey Kramer, Kiley  Kyser, Kavina Marshall, Alexandra McGregor,  Victoria Miller, Christine Norton, Guillermo  Peralta, Ariana Pierce, Jacob Price, McKenzie  Rowley, Thomas Sanday, Eric Stants, Marco  Tori, Jacquelyn Verley, Christie Wilkins, Brennan Woell, Lo-Hua Yuan, Mitchell Zajac.  Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask our colleagues to join me in honoring these exceptional students. May they know that this Nation  is greatly appreciative of  their service and  dedication, and wishes  them  the best  in all  their future endeavors.  HEROES EARNINGS ASSISTANCE  AND RELIEF TAX ACT OF 2008  SPEECHOF  HON. BETTY McCOLLUM  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 20, 2008  ",2008
838,32,2008-05-23,Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6081, the  Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax  (HEART)  Act  and  to  commend  Speaker  PELOSIand Chairman RANGEL for their perseverance  in getting  this  important bill  to  the  President’s desk.  H.R. 6081 includes vital tax provisions that  help military families facing significant financial  hardships due to extended deployments. According to a Department of Defense survey,  55 percent of married National Guardsmen  and Reservists suffer a loss of income when  they are called to active duty. The Heart Act  helps  to  fix  this problem by providing a  tax  credit of up  to $4,000  for small businesses  that continue to pay National Guard and Reserve employees when  they are called  to  serve.  This important bill makes permanent several  IRS provisions  that  relieve economic hardships as a result of military service including  the Earned Income Tax Credit for families of  soldiers  in combat. H.R. 6081 also allows  more military  families  to be eligible  for  the  economic stimulus rebates and makes it easier  for  veterans  to  become  homeowners  through low-interest loans.  The Heart Act is fully offset and will not increase our national debt. It pays for these tax  breaks by closing an offshore loophole that allows government contractors, who receive millions or billions in taxpayers’ dollars, to set up  companies in foreign countries to avoid paying  Social Security and Medicare taxes. For example, defense contractor KBR, has  reportedly avoided paying over $100 million in Social Security and Medicare taxes by creating  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:47 May 24, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A22MY8.070 E23MYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l e b j         ",2008

At this year’s banquet, the Plumbers Local  Union 210 will recognize and honor the 2008  apprentice  graduates. The  individuals who  have  completed  the apprentice  training  in  2008 are: Sonny Armato, Ben Buchholz, Nick  Goodman, Chad Hofferth, Timothy LaMere,  Mario Lopez, Robert Matthews, Kamilah Weaver, Jacob Wesley, and David Young.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its  tradesmen. These graduates are outstanding  examples of each. They have mastered their  trade and have demonstrated their loyalty to  both  the union and  the community  through  their hard work and selfless dedication.  Madam Speaker,  I ask  that you and my  other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating  these dedicated and hardworking  individuals. Along with  the other men and  women of Northwest Indiana’s unions, these  individuals  have  committed  themselves  to  making a significant contribution to the growth  and development of the economy of the First  Congressional District, and I am very proud to  represent them in Washington, DC.  f  HONORING OUR HEROES ON  MEMORIAL DAY  HON.

It was their duty to serve, and with Memorial  Day 2008 on the horizon, it is our duty to remember.  In a tradition that began just 3 years after  the end of the Civil War, Americans set aside  the 30th day of May each year to remember  the sacrifice made by our service men and  women who died while defending freedom.  On May 30, 1868, flowers were placed on  the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers  at Arlington National Cemetery. That practice  has continued for over 130 years as millions  of Americans have laid flowers on the graves  of soldiers from World War II, Vietnam and as  recently as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

I am requesting funding in  the FY09 Defense Authorization bill, Navy Procurement account  for  the Gateway System  manufactured by Ocean Design, Inc., located  at 1026 North Williamson Boulevard in Daytona Beach, Florida 32114.  The $3 million authorized in the Navy’s Procurement budget is to provide funding to the  Navy for the purchase of the Gateway System  that has been under development by the Navy  to provide a fixed surveillance system in meeting the Nation’s Maritime Domain Awareness  security  requirements. This  is  the  first year  procurement money will be used to fund this  project. There will be no cost share, as this  project will benefit the United States Navy.  The U.S. Navy has a requirement to defend  the maritime approaches to the United States  and monitor the littorals as articulated in the  Navy’s 2006 National Strategy  for Maritime  Security. The Gateway System is an open architecture system that allowed for sensors to  be connected covertly  to monitor activity on  the ocean floor, from the ocean floor to the  surface of the water, and above the water to  provide awareness of all activity  to counter  mines, submarines, water traffic, and terrorism  that may pose a threat to the fleet and to the  United States.  f  CONGRATULATING  KTVK–TV  ON  RECEIVING THE 2008 SERVICE TO  AMERICA PARTNERSHIP AWARD  HON.

The deteriorating condition of the aging P–  3 Orion fleet and the recent termination of the  S–3 Viking program have  resulted  in  fewer  manned airborne ASW platforms available to  the Navy’s surface  forces. While  full operational capability of the new P–8 Poseidon is  not expected until 2017–2020 or beyond, Navy  surface combatants are in urgent need of a  low cost, organic system  to  rapidly deploy  acoustic sensors at a distance from the force.  SFV capability will be critical where there is a  deficiency in organic airborne ASW assets, or  in  the  littoral  in situations where a hostile  coastline poses a threat to manned ASW aircraft.  This is the first year funding will be needed  to begin the research and development phase  of this project. There will be no cost share, as  this project is being developed for the Navy.  Requested government  funding of $2.6M  for  the Sonobuoy Flight Kit will achieve the following: 1. Detailed design of SFV and system  components.  2.  Land-based  flight  trials  verifying overall system performance, including  range, speed, and endurance of the SFV. 3.  Complete a production tooled design capable  of supporting LRIP testing. 4. Design and fabricate a compact ship-based  launch mechanism for use on LCS or other surface combatants.  f  HONORING THE MEMORY OF BEN  BUERGER  HON.

844,46,2008-05-23,Mr. BONNER.," Madam Speaker, Mobile  County and indeed the entire state of Alabama  recently lost a dear friend, and I rise today to  honor and pay tribute to the memory of Mr.  Ben Buerger.  Since 1956, ‘‘Mr. Ben’’ owned and operated  Ship and Shore Supplies Inc. on Dauphin Island; his store was truly the heartbeat of the  island. His business sold everything from groceries  to plumbing  fixtures, building supplies  and boating needs. He may be best known for  riding out 1979’s Hurricane Frederic  in his  store, which was one of the most devastating  hurricanes ever to hit the central Gulf Coast.  Following  the storm,  ‘‘Mr. Ben’’ set up  temporary quarters on the island and worked to  provide a consistent supply of necessities to  the island’s residents when they needed them  the most.  ‘‘Mr. Ben’’ was always there to give a helping hand. For example, in 1959, when the lift  span to the old Dauphin Island Bridge became  stuck, he used his own boat to ferry stranded  tourists and others to the mainland for free. In  recognition of all of his efforts on behalf of the  people of his community, Mobile’s Press-Register awarded ‘‘Mr. Ben’’ the M.O. Beale Scroll  of Merit in 1963 and in 1968.  To say that Ben Buerger was active in the  Dauphin  Island community  is an understatement; he was truly an ambassador for the island. He served as president of the Dauphin  Island Businessman’s Association, president  of the Dauphin Island Volunteer Fire Department and president of the Mobile County Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department.  ‘‘Mr.  Ben’’ also served in the U.S. Navy and was a  veteran of World War II.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me  in  remembering a dedicated community  leader and  friend  to many  throughout south  Alabama. Ben Buerger will be deeply missed  by his family—his wife, Barbara Buerger; his  daughters, Karen Rebecca Moore and Kathryn  Barker; his step-daughter, Michele Oliver; his  sister-in-law, Caroline Buerger;  his  granddaughter, Kari Howell; his great-grandson, Nathan Howell; and his step-grandchildren, Anjel  Clark and Alex Oliver—as well as the countless friends and fellow islanders he leaves behind.  Our thoughts and prayers are with them all  at this difficult time.  f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO DOUGLAS K.  RAMSEY  HON. JON C. PORTER  OFNEVADA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 22, 2008  ",2008
845,46,2008-05-23,Mr. PORTER.," Madam Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to rise today to honor my good  friend Douglas K. Ramsey by entering his  name in the CONGRESSIONALRECORD, the official record of the proceedings and debates of  the United States Congress since 1873. Today  I pay  tribute  to Douglas K. Ramsey,  for his  service to the United States of America during  the Vietnam War.  Mr. Ramsey  is  truly an American patriot.  Following graduate studies at Harvard University, Mr. Ramsey entered the United States Air  Force and served two years as a lieutenant in  the field of communications intelligence.  In 1960, following his service in the United  States Air Force, Mr. Ramsey  joined  the  United States Department of State and was  assigned to the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. Mr. Ramsey arrived at his duty post in  Saigon, Vietnam, on May 3, 1963. While working for the State Department’s diplomatic effort  in Vietnam, Mr. Ramsey served in a number  of  capacities,  including Assistant Provincial  Representative in Hau Nghia.  On January 17, 1966, Mr. Ramsey was captured by a Viet Cong ambush party while  transporting food and medical instruments to  assist refugees and evacuees. During his time  in Viet Cong custody, Mr. Ramsey suffered  from malaria as well as neglect at the hands  of his captors. He was finally released on February 12, 1973.  Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Douglas K. Ramsey. He  is  truly an unsung hero  and an American patriot. In these times when  we often recognize the members of our armed  services  for  their sacrifice and dedication  in  defense of America, we must also pause and  reflect upon  the  service of our men and  women in the diplomatic corps, who also risk  their lives in defense of our way of life. I thank  Mr. Ramsey for his service to America and the  Boulder City community, and wish him  the  best in his future endeavors. As we celebrate  Memorial Day this weekend, I urge my fellow  Nevadans to pay tribute to the service of our  fellow citizens in defense of freedom and democracy.  f  TRIBUTE TO KORYNE KANESKI  HORBAL  HON.

During that  time she, and noted author and feminist, Gloria Steinem, became good friends and have  since worked  together  on many  projects.  Koryne has been a contributing writer to MS.

In recognition of Koryne’s contribution to society, Augsburg College established  the Koryne Horbal  Lecture Series  to continue opening  the windows of opportunity  for young women and  men  that  reflect Koryne’s commitment  to a  gender equal society. Fittingly, next month  Koryne Horbal will receive a  ‘‘Humane With  Respect’’ honorary college degree from Augsburg College that she didn’t have the opportunity to acquire in her younger years.  Koryne  is a  loyal and dear  friend—and a  loving grandmother. If you asked Koryne, of all  her renowned accomplishments; all  the barriers she’s broken down; all the glass ceilings  she’s shattered; all  the myths she’s proven  wrong; what she is most proud of? Undoubtedly, and without hesitation, she would say  loving grandmother—to a young man named  Bryce Horbal whom she has raised since infancy. Bryce is a 13 year old honors student  at Columbia Heights Middle School in my district. This young man, who  towers over his  grandmother at over 6 feet, reflects the values  that have shaped his young  life—instilled  in  him with a nurturing and loving hand by his  grandmother. Almost  three years ago,  this  young man wrote a poem that shows us why  the accolades and accomplishments Koryne  has achieved pale in comparison to the grandson she has raised. Bryce Horbal is a young  man of whom much will be expected.

848,53,2008-05-23,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Madam Speaker, it gives  me great pleasure to pay tribute to the outstanding  achievements  of  an  exceptional  group of students from Munster High School,  located  in  Indiana’s First Congressional District. Two exceptional  teams  from Munster  High School, Team Adams and Team Jefferson, accomplished  the extraordinary  feat of  finishing  in  first and second place,  respectively, in the State competition of the We the  People: The Citizen and the Constitution program. Following their victory at the State level,  Team Adams went on to compete in the nain Washington, DC÷,  tional  finals held  from  May 3-May 5, 2008. For their knowledge and  understanding of  the American Government,  these extraordinary young people received an  honorable mention as one of the top ten finalists at this year’s national competition.  The We the People program, administered  by the Center for Civic Education, is a program that reaches over 28 million elementary,  middle, and high school students. The goal of  the program is to provide students with an understanding of the fundamentals of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The program  helps students to understand their rights under  the American governmental system.  The people of Munster, as well as the entire  northwest Indiana community, can be proud of  this truly remarkable class of students. Team  Adams consisted of  the  following students:  James Burgwald, Sarah Chowdhury, Sophia  Griggs, Nicole Hong, Megan Hruska, Grant  Huebner, Daniel Jayakar, Robin Jiang, Neil  Keshvani, Charlie Krull, Alicia Nieves, Paige  Patterson, Blake Platt, Michael Pudlow, Matt  Stewart, Nicholas Stoffregen, and  Julianne  Watterson. Team Jefferson was comprised of:  Danny Alexander, Eric Anderson, Keriann  Ballanco, Katharine Banks, Arefin Chowdhury,  Lorien Estes, Amy Fuhs, Carly Gibbs, Russell  Gonzalez,  Jonathan  Harangody,  Jessica  Hilbrich,  Nithin  Krishnan,  Viraj  Maniar,  Samantha Mardyla, Martha Mihich,  Lana  Muhrez, Molly  Poczontek,  Abhinav  Ravi,  Christopher Witter, and Meagan Yothment.  Madam Speaker, I would like to once again  extend my most heartfelt congratulations  to  the members of Munster High School’s We  the People program, as well as their coach,  Mr. Michael Gordon, and all of the community  and  faculty members who have  instilled  in  these students the desire to succeed. The values exhibited by these young people and their  interest in the history and fundamentals of our  great Nation serve to inspire us all. I am proud  to  represent  these  fine  individuals  in Congress, and I am proud to have been given this  opportunity to recognize these future leaders.  I look forward to watching their achievements  as they continue to rise to the top.  f  HONORING THE MEMORY OF DR.  JACK HYMAN  HON.

849,53,2008-05-23,Mr. BONNER.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor the memory of an outstanding doctor,  a wonderful man, and a truly great American,  Dr. Jack Hyman.  Dr. Hyman was born in Tampa, Florida, and  graduated as valedictorian  from Plant High  School. After graduating from the University of  Florida, he entered Tulane Medical School  and received his M.D.  in 1941. He spent a  year training in Urology before he was commissioned in the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant. He served in World War II as a physician  in the Pacific Theatre of Operations. Just two  short days after he returned from the war, Dr.  Hyman married  his  longtime  sweetheart,  Frances Levy.

850,5,2008-06-06,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, the Constitution places the power of the purse  squarely in the hands of Congress. The  Lieberman-Warner  climate  security  bill and the Boxer substitute to  it,  however, thwart the Constitution and  longstanding  tradition  by  shifting  much spending power to the executive  branch. In order to protect Congress’s  constitutional role to make spending  decisions, I have introduced an amendment, cosponsored by Senators MURRAY, DORGAN, LEAHY, DURBIN, FEINSTEIN, and MIKULSKI.  Enacting this climate change legislation  in  its current  form would vest  unelected executive branch boards and  agencies with unprecedented discretion  on Federal spending in excess of more  than $1.4 trillion in new and existing  Federal programs over a span of 38  years.  Rather than Congress making decisions on funding and conducting oversight of Federal programs as intended  by the Constitution, much of these responsibilities would be in the hands of  the executive branch agencies.  In one specific case, the burden would  be  on  Congress  to  stop  executive  branch decisions on Federal spending  related to climate change initiatives.  The Climate Change Technology Board  would simply have to notify congressional committees 60 days in advance  of a funding distribution for a range of  energy  technology  programs.  The  money would be spent unless Congress  could pass a law, signed by the President, to stop it. Effectively, the Senate  could only stop the spending if it could  muster 67 votes.  The  legislation would  not  expire  until 2050, meaning that the executive  branch would go unchecked on spending decisions related to climate change  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:44 Sep 14, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD08\RECFILES\S06JN8.REC S06JN8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008

Global warming is a problem that we  must address and the sooner the better.  We must meet it with a strong and  mandatory regulatory system. Of all  the possible options, a cap-and-trade  system makes the most sense. Turning  that concept into legislative language  is not easy, and turning it into legislative language that can become law is  far harder still.

852,19,2008-06-06,Mr. CASEY.," Mr. President, I rise for  two purposes. One is to speak for a couple minutes about today’s anniversary  of D-day and then also to talk about a  Pennsylvanian who lost his life in Iraq  and was this week awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. I, first, wish  to speak about D-day.  We observe this anniversary today, 64  years, but we have  to  think  today  about how we do that. We know what  happened on D-day. For so many Americans, prior to just a number of years  ago, it was a piece of history we read  about in the history books. We learned  a bit about it in school, but for a new  generation of Americans, D-day has  meant what we saw in the movie ‘‘Saving Private Ryan.’’ Thank goodness for  that film because it captured so much  of the horror, so much of the sacrifice  and the valor of our troops.  So we  remember  those Americans  who gave their lives that day to save  the world—literally to save the world  from the horror that could have befallen the world if the axis powers were  successful, and if D-day did not go as  well as it did, they might have been  successful.  I am remembering today not just a  generation of Americans, the ‘‘greatest  generation’’ of Americans as we know  them now, who sacrificed so much, but  I am thinking of people from my home  State. I think Pennsylvania had more  Medal of Honor winners in World War  II than any other State. One of them  was  in my home area, Lackawanna  County, Geno Merli, who served in Europe, in that theater of the war, and  was awarded the Congressional Medal  of Honor and passed away a couple of  years ago. So when I think of D-day,  and I think of those sacrifices, I am  thinking of heroes such as Geno Merli  and so many others who gave the ultimate sacrifice. His Medal of Honor pertained to his combat not on D-day but  in a related theater of war.  We  think  about  those who  came  back. We think about those who served  and came back, many of them wounded  permanently and irreparably, just as  we see today with some of our troops in  Iraq, and it brings to mind Abraham  Lincoln’s words in two contexts. One is  the context of those who have served.  He talked about the soldier—him who  has borne the battle—that we must  care for him who has borne the battle.  And I think one way to honor those  who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan  or around the world or in wars like  World War II is to remember something  my father said years ago when he was  serving as Governor of Pennsylvania,  and he talked about praying for our  troops, as important as that is, but he  also  talked about praying  for ourselves; that we may be worthy of their  valor.  I believe the only way we can be worthy of the valor of those who served in  World War II on D-day or served in Iraq  or Afghanistan or anywhere around the  world—in Vietnam, in the Korean War,  whatever the conflict was—we can’t  just honor them by remembering and  commemorating and talking about battles and all of the information that we  can impart about war. We have to, if  we are going to be worthy of their  valor, do the right thing today, not  just when we commemorate D-day but  every day.  There are at least two things we can  do to pay tribute to those who served  and to be worthy of their valor. One  way is to make sure those who survive  a war and come back to the United  States have not just some health care  but the best health care. And we have  to fund it. Fortunately, in the last two  budgets we have been doing that. We  have been meeting or exceeding the  budget on veterans health care.  The second thing we must do, at the  very least, is make sure anyone who  serves in combat has an opportunity to  be educated as best we can provide.  That is why the vote on the GI bill recently was so essential, so central to  meeting that basic obligation, so caring,  as Abraham Lincoln  said,  for  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:44 Sep 14, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD08\RECFILES\S06JN8.REC S06JN8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008

He described the  role of himself and others, and particularly the occupant of the chair as Presiding Officer, in working on the new  GI bill. I was proud to be a cosponsor.  I  join him  in hoping that President  Bush will agree with the majority of  the House and the Senate to look favorably upon this bill and agree to sign  legislation that includes this bill. We  owe it to America’s veterans. I appreciate the comments made by my colleague from New Jersey.  f  TRIBUTE TO ROBERT KENNEDY  ",2008
854,26,2008-06-06,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, I wish  to talk just for a moment today about  the cloture vote on climate change legislation earlier today, but first, while I  am getting  some charts  together,  I  wanted to mention also that this is the  40th anniversary that was yesterday of  the death of Robert Kennedy.  I was driving to the Capitol listening  to a news report about that day 40  years ago when Robert Kennedy was  assassinated in Los Angeles, CA, and I  was thinking about the fact that I was  a very young man back then working  on the Robert Kennedy Presidential  campaign in my State when I heard  that he had been assassinated. It was  such an unbelievable blow to me and to  all of the others who worked on the  campaign and to so many other Americans who believed his campaign for the  Presidency held such great promise.  Most young people in this country  today know nothing about a 1968 Presidential campaign by Robert F. Kennedy. It was an extraordinary time,  and he was an extraordinary man. I  wish to read just a couple of comments  by the late Robert F. Kennedy, who  was, by the way, a Senator and served  in this body, as well as served as Attorney General of this country.  He gave a speech once that I have  often quoted. It was a speech he gave in  South Africa. Many will know these  words. In his speech he said this:  Few will have the greatness to bend history; but each of us can work to change a  small portion of the events, and in the total  of all these acts will be written the history  of a generation . . . it is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human  history is thus shaped. Each time a man  stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the  lot of others, or strikes out against injustice,  they send forth a tiny ripple of hope, and  crossing each other from a million different  centers of energy and daring those ripples  build a current which can sweep down the  mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.  He gave that speech June 6, 1966, at  the University of Cape Town in South  Africa. People often talk about those  ripples of hope that can sweep down  the mightiest walls of resistance and  oppression, and that passion and that  dream and belief still exist today.  I reread this morning the speech Robert Kennedy gave during his Presidential campaign in Indianapolis, IN,  on the evening of April 4, 1968, when  Martin Luther King was assassinated.  The crowd that had gathered for Robert Kennedy’s appearance did not know  that Dr. Martin Luther King had been  assassinated and Robert Kennedy came  to that area of Indianapolis. He was  asked not to go because of concerns  about his safety. He went anyway and  he gave one of the most wonderful  speeches. It was without a note, just an  extemporaneous  speech  that had  so  much passion. I shall not read it today,  but I ask unanimous consent that it be  printed in the RECORDat this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  Ladies and Gentlemen—I’m only going to  talk to you just for a minute or so this  evening. Because . . .  I have some very sad news for all of you,  and I think sad news for all of our fellow  citizens, and people who love peace all over  the world, and that is that Martin Luther  King was shot and was killed tonight  in  Memphis, Tennessee.  Martin Luther King dedicated his life to  love and to justice between fellow human  beings. He died in the cause of that effort. In  this difficult day, in this difficult time for  the United States, it’s perhaps well to ask  what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in.  For those of you who are black—considering the evidence evidently is that there  were white people who were responsible—you  can be filled with bitterness, and with hatred, and a desire for revenge.  We can move in that direction as a country,  in greater polarization—black people  amongst blacks, and white amongst whites,  filled with hatred toward one another. Or we  can make an effort, as Martin Luther King  did, to understand and to comprehend, and  replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed  that has spread across our land, with an effort to understand, compassion and love.  For those of you who are black and are  tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against  all white people, I would only say that I can  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:44 Sep 14, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD08\RECFILES\S06JN8.REC S06JN8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008
855,33,2008-06-06,Mr. ROBERTS.," Mr. President, I wish  today to recognize the Naval Junior  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps,  NJROTC, of Shawnee Mission North  High School in Overland Park, KS, for  their outstanding performance in the  2008 NJROTC Nationals competition.  For 3 consecutive years, the Shawnee  Mission North NJROTC,  under  the  leadership and guidance of Chief Warrant Officer  4 Dennis C. Grayless,  USMC  (Ret) and Chief Petty Officer  Christopher W. Neven, USN (Ret), has  qualified to compete in the prestigious  NJROTC National Academic, Athletic  and Drill Championship hosted by the  Navy League of the United States at  the Pensacola Naval Air Station, Pensacola, FL. The NJROTC Nationals, or  ‘‘Navy Nationals’’ as  it  is affectionately referred to by the participants, is  the most comprehensive test of overall  JROTC training and performance in existence  today. The Nation’s  finest  NJROTC units  from each of the 11  Navy Areas participate in this two-day  academic, athletic, and drill competition.  There  is  no  competition  in  JROTC  that provides a more  comprehensive test of program quality.  Earlier this year, the Shawnee Mission North team was recognized as the  Area 9 Most Outstanding Unit after  sweeping the NJROTC Area 9 Championship Drill Team Competition. The  team placed first in armed exhibition,  unarmed exhibition, armed regulation,  unarmed  regulation,  push-ups,  curl-  ups/sit-ups and in the 16 x 100 shuttle  relay. While they placed second in the  competition for Color Guard, 8 x 200  oval relay, academics, and personnel  inspection. As 2008 Area 9 Regional  Champion, the team qualified to return  to the Navy Nationals for the third  consecutive year.  At the 2008 national competition, the  Shawnee Mission North team placed  first in the Nation in the Armed Regulation Drill and finished seventh in the  overall  competition.  Cadet  Dylan  Warnick received individual honors by  finishing third  in the Nation  in the  male  curl-up/sit-up  competition  by  completing 320 cadenced curl-ups/sit-  ups  in  5 minutes.  Cadet Bethany  Krzesinski received individual honors  by finishing sixth in the Nation in the  female curl-up/sit up competition by  completing 268 cadenced curl-ups/sit-  ups in 5 minutes. While Cadet Michael  Hoffman received individual honors by  tying for fifth in the Nation in the  male  push-up  competition  by  completing 114 cadenced push-ups in 5 minutes.  As reflected in the success achieved  by  the  Shawnee  Mission  North  NJROTC  unit,  it  is  apparent  the  breadth  and  depth  of  commitment,  dedication, hard work, resolve and motivation each member of this team possesses. The Shawnee Mission North  NJROTC unit has been recognized as a  Naval Honor Unit (1992–1999), a Naval  Distinguished Unit (2000, 2007, 2008), recipient of the Unit Achievement Award  (2003), a Chief of Naval Education and  Training Unit (1988, 1989), the 2007 National Academic, Athletic and Drill  Champions, and the 2008 Area 9 Most  Outstanding Unit. Five of  its graduating cadets have enlisted into the  U.S. Armed Forces;  one  has  been  awarded an NROTC scholarship to attend Purdue University; and two cadets  from the junior class have been accepted into the 2008 summer semester at  the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis,  MD.  Mr. President, I ask my distinguished  colleagues in the Senate to join me in  recognizing  and  congratulating  the  Shawnee Mission North Naval Junior  Reserve Officer Training Corps 2008 National Championship Team: Sara Atwood, Michael Barr, Jessie Biggs, Andrew  Boyce, Amiee  Busch, Robert  Byrd,  Matthew  Carlyon,  Bryan  Chapple, Faith Cole, Amanda Fuller,  Tyler Gearin, Darrell Hayes, Joshua  Hoffman, Michael  Hoffman,  Alisyn  Katsantones, Stacey Kennedy, Bethany  Krzesinski,  Lauren  Lawson, Megan  Lawson,  Shelby  McIntosh,  Justin  Manford,  Kyle Middaugh,  Timothy  Oehlert, Philip Park, Brandon Patrick,  Aaron Patterson, Jeremy Payne, Jersey Payne, Devin Root, Niklas Rueter,  Djourdan  Stephens,  Aliana  Swiercinsky,  Brandon Ware, Dylan  Warnick, Gregory Wynn, and Rachel  Yearsley.∑  sary of the Allied Powers’ invasion of  Normandy, to pay tribute to Henry and  Homer Montgomery, two brothers who  answered their Nation’s call to duty.  These brothers, like so many of their  peers, gave up the comforts of home to  go to an unfamiliar land to fight in defense of our Nation.  Henry Montgomery, now 92, hit the  beach at Normandy on June 7, 1944. He  served in the European theater as an  artilleryman and motorcycle courier,  walking much of the way between Normandy and Berlin. This  journey of  nearly 1,000 miles was so arduous that  when he arrived in Berlin, he was medically discharged and returned to our  shores on a hospital ship.  Homer Montgomery, now 82, served  in the Pacific theater toward the end of  World War II halfway around the world  from his brother. He was a Military Police officer who served through the end  of the war.  The contributions made by these two  brothers are an excellent example of  the sacrifices made by our greatest  generation. They were able to see our  nation and our allies emerge from the  war victorious and return home unlike  so many of their brothers  in arms.  Their commitment to this struggle and  that of their comrades was critical to  securing our liberties, and our nation  is forever indebted to them.  And so, Mr. President I am honored  to pay  tribute  to  these  two great  American patriots. May they greatly  enjoy the freedom they have secured  for all of us.∑  f  MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE  At 11:26 a.m., a message  from the  House of Representatives, delivered by  Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the  following bills, in which it requests the  concurrence of the Senate:  H.R. 3021.

857,13,2008-06-16,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. President. I must  say I am puzzled why a Republican minority voted last week to prevent the  Senate  from even proceeding to the  consideration of a bill—H.R. 6049, the  Energy Independence and Tax Relief  Act of 2008—designed to bring down  sky-high oil and gasoline prices, promote clean and renewable energy, create good jobs here in America, and put  our Nation on a path to energy security. I am equally puzzled at the opposition to the provisions being paid for  by closing a tax loophole on offshore  income made by hedge fund managers.  The American people need our help and  we have a bill that would provide much  needed relief to American families and  yet we can’t even get enough votes to  legislate on the bill.  The price of crude oil on the spot  market is approaching $140 per barrel,  nearly double the price of 1 year ago.  When President Bush took office, a gallon of regular gas cost $1.46 and a gallon of diesel  fuel cost $1.53. Today,  those prices are at all-time highs, with  regular gas costing $4.02 per gallon and  diesel fuel costing $4.77 per gallon. A  new poll indicates that 60 percent of  Americans are reducing spending on  other priorities because of rising gas  prices. One-half of all households with  incomes below $20,000 say they face severe hardships because of soaring gas  prices. Clearly, the status quo is intolerable, but the minority won’t even let  the Senate consider bills to address  these problems, much less pass them.  As I said, I find that puzzling. Generally speaking, the legislative process  works best when we are actually legislating.  Last week, the Senate fell 10 votes  short of invoking cloture on the motion  to proceed  to H.R.  6049.  I am  pleased to see that we are going to try  again to invoke cloture; I hope we prevail  this  time.  In addition  to promoting our Nation’s energy security,  this bill provides critical tax relief for  families and businesses, which is why I  am a cosponsor of substitute amendment Senator BAUCUShopes to offer to  this bill if we can get to it.  The Energy  Independence and Tax  Relief Act of  2008 provides approximately $18 billion in tax incentives for  investment  in renewable energy, energy efficiency and conservation, carbon capture and  sequestration demonstration projects. One provision of  the bill specifically authorizes $2 billion  for new clean renewable energy  bonds. These bonds are essential  in  helping finance facilities that generate  electricity from alternative resources  like:  wind,  small  irrigation,  geothermal, hydropower, and landfill gas  or trash combustion facilities.  The bill also provides tax credits for  renewable energy production, solar energy and fuel cell investment and tax  credits for energy-efficient commercial  buildings. Buildings account for over  one-third of America’s consumption, 49  percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, 25  percent of nitrous oxide emissions, and  10 percent of particulate emissions, all  of which damage urban air quality.  They also produce 38 percent of the  country’s carbon dioxide emissions—  the chief pollutant blamed for climate  change. By changing the way buildings  operate, we can change our  ‘‘carbon  footprint’’ on the Earth.  In addition to helping companies explore the use of alternative fuels and  energy saving products, we must also  act individually. Recognizing this, Senator BAUCUS’s legislation also provides  incentives  for  individual  taxpayers.  The bill incorporates tax credits for energy efficient appliances in homes and  energy efficient improvements to existing and new homes. If  just 1  in 10  homes used ENERGY STAR-qualified  appliances, a  joint program between  the U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy, the effect would be like planting  1.7 million new acres of trees. Additionally, by making homes more energy efficient, we generate less air pollution  and reduce high energy bills. Most of  the energy used  in our homes often  comes from the burning of fossil fuels  at powerplants, which contributes to  acid rain and smog. By improving your  home, whether by the appliances you  choose or energy efficient remodeling,  you take an important step forward in  protecting the environment.  The bottom line is that we have to  conserve oil by using  it more efficiently, and we have to find domestic  alternatives to oil.

858,20,2008-06-16,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce the Fugitive Information Networked Database Act of  2008, or the FIND Act. This bill provides resources to law enforcement to  ensure the entry of  felony warrants  into the national FBI database and to  assist in tracking down and extraditing  fugitives. It helps ensure that fugitives  who flee their States will be located,  apprehended, and brought to justice. It  protects our communities by taking  dangerous criminals off the streets.  According to a recent series of articles  in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,  anywhere from 1.9 million to 2.7 million  felony  fugitives are on the run  from law enforcement. When State and  local law enforcement issue a warrant  for a  fugitive’s arrest, they are expected to enter it into the FBI’s National Crime Information Center database as well as into their own State  and local databases. The national database is accessible to all State and local  law enforcement agencies, which use  the national database to track  fugitives around the country.  The national database is only as good  as the information that States enter  into it, however. Too often, State and  local law enforcement agencies enter  warrants into the State and local databases, but not into the national database. It is estimated that more than a  third of all felony warrants have not  been entered into the national database.  That means  anywhere  from  800,000 to 1.6 million wanted felons can  escape justice and remain at large in  our communities simply by crossing  State lines.  Unless a warrant is entered into the  national database, a sheriff or police  officer who stops a fugitive has no way  of knowing that he is wanted in another  jurisdiction—sometimes  for  a  violent crime. Many fugitives go on to  commit  additional  crimes  in  other  States. Some know that if they can  flee across State lines, there’s a good  chance they can—in some cases—get  away with murder. This is inexcusable.  I have heard a range of reasons why  State and local law enforcement have  not been entering felony warrants into  the national database. Some reasons  are valid. For instance, if law enforcement is using a person suspected of a  felony as an  informant,  it’s understandable that they would not want to  enter the informant’s name into the  database.  Many jurisdictions don’t enter warrants into the national database, however, simply because they don’t have  the time and resources to update and  validate warrant entries, which  is a  resource- and time-intensive process.  Fortunately, the burden of warrant  entry and validation can be alleviated.  By developing new databases, or by upgrading existing ones, to ensure compatibility and interoperability with the  national database, State and local law  enforcement can facilitate information  sharing and  seamless warrant entry  into databases at all levels of government. With additional resources to hire  personnel  for the validation process,  State and local law enforcement can  enter felony warrants into the national  database without worrying about not  having the resources to validate them.  The FIND Act addresses the problem  of warrant backlogs by providing State  and local law enforcement with the resources necessary to develop and upgrade  their  systems, and hire additional personnel to perform the validation process. Specifically, it authorizes  $25 million for fiscal years 2009 and 2010  for grants to States to develop new systems or upgrade existing systems so  that they are interoperable with the  NCIC database.  Another  reason  law  enforcement  doesn’t enter felony warrants into the  national database is concern that the  State will not have the resources to extradite the fugitive if he is found outside the State’s borders. Helping State  and local agencies enter their felony  warrants into the national database is  therefore only half the battle. We also  need to ensure that when a dangerous  fugitive is caught, the jurisdiction in  which he is wanted can work with the  U.S. Marshals Service to extradite him  to face justice.  While I was drafting this bill, I spoke  to one sheriff who apprehended an individual wanted  for  rape  in  another  State. The sheriff notified that State  that he had their criminal in custody,  but when the State said they didn’t  have the resources to extradite him,  the sheriff had no choice but to free the  rapist into his community.

867,27,2008-06-16,Mr.  INOUYE.," Madam President,  I  rise today in support of the substitute  to H.R. 3403, the New and Emerging  Technologies 911 Improvement Act of  2008. The Senate companion, S. 428, was  passed by unanimous consent on February 26, 2008. This bill would provide  911 service for Voice over Internet Protocol, VoIP, subscribers.  I can think of few government initiatives that have been as successful as  911. Since its creation nearly 30 years  ago, 911 has become a lifeline for people  in trouble. I think it is safe to say that  just  about  every  American  today  knows that 911 is the easiest and most  effective means to contact emergency  services.  As technology has advanced, so has  911 service. Today, many places in the  Nation have E911. In these areas, when  you call for help, your phone number  and location are automatically transmitted to emergency personnel. If your  call  is  disconnected,  you  are  disoriented, or do not know your location,  this information can make all the difference in securing your safety.  But the E911 system was built for  wireline service. So as technology advanced and wireless phones grew  in  popularity, we worked to apply E911  principles to wireless service. With the  advent of VoIP, we are  challenged  again to ensure that our 911 policies  are up to date.  I believe that the New and Emerging  Technologies 911 Improvement Act of  2008 does an excellent job of improving  911 service and adapting it to the latest  telecommunications technology, and I  ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.  Senator BILLNELSON, the sponsor of  the Senate bill, Senator SNOWE, Senator STEVENS, and I have worked with  our colleagues in the House to develop  this substitute. Once the Senate passes  H.R. 3403, as amended, we expect the  House to act expeditiously so that this  bill can become law, allowing our 911  system to continue to save lives and  ensuring  individuals can always call  for help regardless of the underlying  technology they use.

874,6,2008-06-20,Mr. CARDOZA.," I am the final speaker on my side of the aisle.  Mr.  LINCOLN  DIAZ-BALART  of  Florida. Madam Speaker, back on April  24 of 2006, just over 2 years ago, Speakissued the following  statement, which I quote:  ‘‘With skyrocketing gas prices it is  clear that the American people can no  longer afford the Republican Rubber  stamp Congress and its failure to stand  up to Republican big oil and gas company cronies. Americans this week are  paying $2.91 a gallon on average for  regular gasoline, 33 cents higher than  last month, and double the price when  President Bush first came into office.’’  Madam  Speaker, most Americans  would be happy if they were paying  $2.91 today  for a gallon of gasoline.  When Americans are paying over $4 for  gasoline, we should be working on legislation to lower the cost of gasoline,  increasing  domestic  energy  exploration, reducing our reliance on unstable foreign sources of oil.  So today, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that this  House can immediately consider solutions to rising energy costs. By defeating the previous question, I will move  to amend the rule to allow for consideration of H.R. 2279, Expanding American Refinery Capacity on Closed Military Installations, introduced by Representative PITTS.  This legislation would significantly  reduce the cost of gasoline by streamer NANCYPELOSI lining the refinery application process.  It will also require the President to  open at least three closed military installations  for the purpose of siting  new and reliable American refineries.  Madam Speaker,  I ask unanimous  consent  to  insert  the  text  of  the  amendment and extraneous material  immediately prior to the vote on the  previous question.  ",2008
875,6,2008-06-20,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Is there  objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida?  There was no objection.  Mr.  LINCOLN  DIAZ-BALART  of  Florida. By voting  ‘‘no’’ on the previous question, Members can take a  stand against high fuel prices and in  favor of taking action to confront that  problem.  I encourage a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  ",2008
876,6,2008-06-20,Mr. CARDOZA.," Madam Speaker, in  closing, I’d like to remind my friend  and colleague from Florida that it has  been the other body, the Republicans  in the other body and the White House  who have stymied the Democratic efforts to actually reduce gas prices and  provide  alternative  energy  for  this  country. Certainly, it is a problem, and  certainly,  the American  people  are  very frustrated at paying $4 or more, in  my State it’s much more for a gallon of  gas. But had we at least moved in a  new direction, we could be heading in  that direction. But we have been totally stymied by the White House and  the Senate on these questions.  Madam Speaker, today’s bill deals  with children, and there is an urgent  problem in many residential treatment  facilities that have gone unchecked for  far too long and must be addressed.  H.R. 5876 will go a long way towards  ensuring  the  safety of our Nation’s  children who depend on these treatment facilities.  Again, I ask my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support this commonsense  legislation  to protect our  kids in these treatment facilities.  I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule and  on the previous question.  The material previously referred to  by Mr. LINCOLNDIAZ-BALARTof Florida  is as follows:  AMENDMENTTOH. RES. 1276 OFFEREDBYMR.  LINCOLNDIAZ-BALARTOFFLORIDA  At the end of the resolution, add the following:  SEC. 3. Immediately upon the adoption of  this  resolution  the House  shall, without  intervention of any point of order, consider  in the House the bill (H.R. 2279) to expedite  the construction of new refining capacity on  closed military installations in the United  States. All points of order against the bill  are waived. The bill shall be considered as  read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and any amendment thereto to find passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate  on the bill equally divided and controlled by  the chairman and ranking member of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce, and  the chairman and ranking member of the  Committee on Armed Services; and (2) an  amendment in the nature of a substitute if  offered by Representative Dingell of Michigan or Representative Skelton of Missouri,  which shall be considered as read and shall  be separately debatable for 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent  and an opponent; and (3) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.  (The  information  contained herein was  provided by Democratic Minority on multiple occasions throughout the 109th Congress.)  THEVOTEONTHEPREVIOUSQUESTION: WHAT  ITREALLYMEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the  previous question on a special rule, is not  merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering  the  previous  question  is  a  vote  against the Democratic majority agenda and  a vote to allow the opposition, at least for  the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It  is a vote about what the House should be debating.  Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the  House of Representatives, (VI, 308–311) describes the vote on the previous question on  the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the  consideration of the subject before the House  being made by the Member in charge.’’ To  defeat the previous question is to give the  opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s  ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that  ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the  control of the resolution to the opposition’’  in order to offer an amendment. On March  15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated  the previous question and a member of the  opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry,  asking who was  entitled  to  recognition.  Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–llinois) said:  ‘‘The previous question having been refused,  the gentleman  from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to  yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to  the first recognition.’’  Because the vote today may look bad for  the Democratic majority they will say ‘‘the  vote on the previous question is simply a  vote on whether to proceed to an immediate  vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and]  has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what  they have always said. Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the  Floor Procedures Manual published by the  Rules Committee  in  the  1091th Congress,  (page 56). Here’s how the Rules Committee  described the rule using information from  Congressional Quarterly’s  ‘‘American Congressional Dictionary’’:  ‘‘If  the  previous  question is defeated, control of debate shifts  to the leading opposition member (usually  the minority Floor Manager) who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business.’’  Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of  Representatives,  the  subchapter  titled  ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal  to order the previous question on such a rule  [a special rule reported from the Committee  on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question  on a resolution reported from the Committee  on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question,  who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate  thereon.’’  Clearly, the vote on the previous question  on a rule does have substantive policy implications.

879,27,2008-06-20,Mr. BLUNT.," Madam Speaker, I thank  Mr. HOEKSTRA for yielding me this initial time that would have the otherwise gone to you.  I  thank you, Mr. HOEKSTRA, Mr.  REYESand Mr. SMITH, for bringing this  important piece of legislation to the  floor and for working so hard to see  that it came to the floor. I would also  like to say that I again appreciated the  opportunity  to work with my good  friend Mr. HOYER, as he spent so many  hours and so much time on this. From  his staff, Mariah Sixkiller; from my  staff, Brian Diffel; Mr. BOEHNER’s staff,  Jen Stewart worked hard on this; Chris  Donesa from Mr. HOEKSTRA’s staff was  indispensable in his work, as was Caroline Lynch from Mr. SMITH’s staff. And  I got to know frankly and work with  Jeremy Bash from Mr. REYES’ staff and  Lou DeBaca from Mr. CONYERS’ staff,  and appreciated the real positive contributions they bring to this process  every day.  I would also like to suggest that two  staffers of my colleague from Missouri,  Mr. BOND, Louis Tucker, and Jack Livingston, spent lots of time and lots of  productive work on this.  Madam Speaker,  this  represents a  compromise, as Mr. REYESjust said, as  Mr. SMITH just said, that was forged  with lots of hard work by lots of people. It accomplishes the goals of the intelligence community. There is no individualized court order for targeting  foreign terrorists in foreign countries.  There are protections here for communications providers that may have assisted  the government. But, as Mr.  REYES just said, those protections will  be determined by a court, not by this  legislation.  We modernized the law to adapt to  changes in technology since the 1978  FISA statute. The bill would accomplish all this while adding new protections and strengthening the individual  liberties and privacy protections of  Americans.  We also worked closely with the majority to reinforce the FISA Court’s  role in procedural certifications and reviews of administration policies, and  we created some new obligations for  the Attorney General  to  establish  guidelines.  Madam  Speaker,  like  yesterday’s  vote, this bill is an example of what we  can do when we work together. I thank  all those who worked so hard to get it  to the floor today. I urge my colleagues  to vote for it.  ",2008

884,27,2008-06-20,Mr.  SCOTT  of  Virginia.," Madam  Speaker, I oppose H.R. 6304. It allows  widespread acquisition of private conversations without meaningful court  review. The bill actually permits the  government  to perform mass untargeted surveillance of any and all conversations believed to be coming into  and out of the United States without  any individualized finding and without  a requirement that wrongdoing is believed to be involved at all.  It arguably is not limited just to terrorism. It could be any foreign intelligence, which would  include diplomacy and anything else. It is vague on  what can be done with the information  after it is acquired and who has access  to it, and the only court review is a  check on whether or not the government certifies  that  the process has  been followed. The court does not review who, what and where the tapping  will take place.  Furthermore, the collection of all of  this data can be done under emergency  provisions before the court acts, but  the collection can continue to be done  even if the court later rejects the application if the administration appeals.  The bill also provides retroactive immunity to communications companies  who may have violated people’s rights,  and whether or not those rights have  been violated should be reviewed by the  courts, not decided here in Congress.  Madam  Speaker, we  can  protect  Americans’ national security and protect civil rights by providing government access to personal conversations  with meaningful court review. This bill  fails to do that, and therefore should be  defeated.  ",2008

But what frightens us most is those people who spend  way too much energy and way too  much time trying to do harm to innocent Americans as they go about their  day-to-day  lives, carrying their children to piano recitals, to Little League  practice, just going to work. It just  makes common sense that we would  want to know what they were trying to  do, because if we know, we have at  least a chance to stop it.  This  is a bipartisan bill  that we  should have had a year ago. We certainly should have had 4 months ago.  Thank goodness we have it today. The  only unfortunate thing is those who  will benefit the most will never know  it, because they never became victims  because we were able to stop those terrorist acts before they took place.

Let me thank my colleagues SYLVESTERREYESand JOHNCONYERS, our  Intelligence and Judiciary Committee  chairmen, for their hard work. I am  pleased that we have resolved this critical national security issue through bipartisan negotiations between the administration and the Congress. I want  to particularly commend STENYHOYER,  our majority leader, and our Speaker,  NANCYPELOSI, for their leadership in  reaching this landmark legislation.  The bill before us is a great improvement over the Senate bill in that it  provides for more rigorous review of  electronic  surveillance  activities.  It  gives the courts a meaningful role in  determining  if  telecommunication  firms are entitled to civil liability protection.  ",2008

Every day, American  men and women deployed  in harm’s  way depend on electronic surveillance  capabilities to achieve their missions.  Because of this bill and the work that  has been done in this Congress, especially the Intelligence Committee and  the  Judiciary  Committee,  I  thank  them, and at the end of the day the  young men and young women will be  the beneficiaries of this strong legislation.

894,34,2008-06-20,Mr. DANIEL E.," LUNGREN of California. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for the time.  Madam Speaker, as  some  say on  radio, ‘‘Now let’s hear the rest of the  story.’’ After the arguments just made  on this floor, this is actually a great  day. We and the American people have  been waiting for this since 12:01 a.m. on  February 6 when the Protect America  Act expired. During  the  intervening  time we have actually been unnecessarily vulnerable to those who would  do us harm in this era of worldwide terrorism.  In fact, Madam Speaker, I would say  that this is the single most important  bill we will vote on this year, not that  I say supporting our troops is not important, but the intelligence that we  gather as the result of the authority  granted by this bill may actually create conditions under which we do not  have to send troops anywhere in the  world and may be more protective of  our rights than any other single thing.  Having come before this body on five  different occasions since that  initial  expiration of the Protect America Act,  I am greatly relieved that we can finally send the intelligence community  and the American people a bill which  will enable the intelligence community  to continue to protect those American  people.  Although the compromise agreement  embodied in the proposal before us is  not necessarily the one I would have  written,  it does,  in my estimation,  meet our responsibilities for protecting  the American people. In other words,  Madam Speaker, it is not the Mona  Lisa but it is not a bad paint job.  First and foremost, the proposal before us ensures that we will continue to  have the ability to monitor the conversations of al Qaeda overseas. And although there are requirements that the  Attorney General and the Director of  National Intelligence adopt procedures  which will be submitted to the FISA  Court, the bill retains sufficient flexibility for our overseas intelligence mission.  In other words, the intelligence community leadership has assured us that  this bill will allow  them  the operational authority to do what needs to  be done within the parameters of the  Constitution. Both the safety of the  American people as well as their civil  liberties are protected in this proposal.  This proposal embodies compromise  language which responds to the legitimate concerns of telecommunication  providers who themselves responded to  the call of their government  in the  wake of 9/11. The language of the bill  not only satisfies the interest of justice, but communicates loudly to all  Americans that if they are ever confronted with such requests, lawful requests, their government will not hang  them out to dry afterwards.  Specifically, a Good Samaritan safe  harbor will exist with respect to any  civil action where there is substantial  evidence to support the certification  provided by the Attorney General. The  quantum of evidence required is merely  a showing of more than a scintilla but  less than a preponderance of evidence.  And although these provisions in the  proposal will contribute  to  securing  the safety of our citizens, this is not to  suggest that I support every provision  in the compromise.  ",2008

897,34,2008-06-20,Mr. DANIEL E.," LUNGREN of California. For example, the so-called ‘‘exclusive means’’ language in the bill is  seen by some as an assertion of maximal congressional authority. Let me  just remind my colleagues that the  FISA Court of review has said all of the  other courts to have decided the issue  held the President did have inherent  authority  to  conduct  warrantless  searches to obtain foreign intelligence  information. The court stated that ‘‘we  take  for granted that the President  does have that authority.’’  So regardless of whether we have a  President McCain  or  a  President  Obama, this language will likely be interpreted in the context of facts in individual cases in light of the constitutional jurisprudence which has arisen  with regard to the collection of foreign  intelligence.  In other words,  it does not either  trample upon the constitutional prerogatives of the Congress nor those  constitutional  prerogatives  of  the  President of the United States. This is  a good compromise.  It protects  the  American people. We have been waiting  for it. It ought to be voted on with dispatch.  ",2008
898,34,2008-06-20,Mr. REYES.," Madam Speaker, I yield  2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman  from  Rhode  Island  (Mr.  LANGEVIN), a valued member of our Intelligence Committee.  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  b1145  ",2008
899,34,2008-06-20,Mr. LANGEVIN.," Madam Speaker, I  rise in support of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. Though not a perfect  piece of legislation, it is clearly far  better than what we have today, and  addresses a number of the many concerns that were raised about the administration’s conduct of surveillance  in this country.  As a member of  the  Intelligence  Committee, I know that we must give  our Intelligence Community the proper  tools to protect us, while upholding the  civil  liberties of Americans. Today’s  compromise  illustrates  what  this  House can do when it deliberates with  care,  holds  steady  against  fear  mongering and acts in the best interests of the country and its citizens.  This bill is strong on civil liberties,  and  includes protections against  infringement of our constitutional right  to privacy.  First, the bill clarifies that FISA is  the exclusive means by which the executive branch may conduct electronic  surveillance on U.S. soil. No President  will have the power to do an end-run  around the legal requirements of FISA.  This provision will prevent the types of  abuses we’ve witnessed under this administration.  Second, this act requires a warrant  from the FISA court to conduct surveillance of Americans abroad. Americans will no  longer  leave their constitutional protections at home when  working, studying or traveling abroad.  Third, it requires prior approval by  the FISA court of procedures the government will use when carrying out  foreign  electronic  surveillance. This  will ensure that the government’s efforts are not aimed at targeting Americans, the so-called reverse targeting  that we’re all concerned about; and  that if an American’s communications  is inadvertently intercepted, it is dealt  with in a manner that guarantees legal  protections.  It also requires and allows for, now,  an IG investigation of this warrantless  surveillance program that took place  prior to Congress being made aware of  this legislation.  ",2008

Congress must continue to conduct robust oversight to  make sure that the law is implemented  as  intended to maintain the critical  and fragile balance of protecting our  Nation and protecting civil liberties.

904,34,2008-06-20,Mr. ISSA.," Madam Speaker, in just 1  minute  it’s  impossible to assure the  American people of everything this bill  will do. But I would like too, if you  will, react to something that was said  on the other side that just simply isn’t  true.  Yes, during J. Edgar Hoover’s day,  there was warrantless  surveillance,  even on political enemies of the people  who were President at the time. Those  days are behind us.

905,41,2008-06-20,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Madam Speaker, I appreciate  the hard work put  in by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both  chambers. For  the past year we’ve participated  in substantial and sometimes heated  debate on the issue of surveillance and foreign  intelligence.  I appreciate  the good  faith  efforts  of  our  leadership,  particularly Mr.  HOYER, as we try to craft legislation that keeps  both our liberties and our persons safe.  For the past seven years I have been highly  critical of Republican wiretapping legislation. I  voted against past efforts to expand this administration’s ability to intrude in the lives of  unknowing and  innocent Americans.  I supported the expiration of the disgraceful Protect  America Act. And I remain confident that the  dedicated members of the intelligence community do not need to violate the rights of Americans in order to protect them.  I have heard some say that the enemies of  America take on many forms. To them I say:  Let us be sure one of those forms is not our  own government.  Ultimately  this  is a compromise  that  falls  short. Any gains  in  security  that may be  achieved are  temporary and are more  than  outweighed by the longer-term loss of civil liberties and oversight. Although this bill is comparatively better than the Senate’s version, I  am troubled by the lack of robust government  oversight, the absence of meaningful court review, and the risk to American liberties.  Of particular concern is the granting of de  facto retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies  that cooperated with  the  administration. A ‘doctor’s note’ from the Attorney General cannot be allowed to circumvent  the entire judicial process.  I am equally concerned with the timeline of  this bill, and strongly oppose authorizing this  legislation for four years. This will extend the  Bush  legacy  throughout  the next administration and the next two sessions of Congress.  Frankly I see no reason to rush into a compromise that comes up this short. The American people would be better served if we continued to debate this issue and took up a bill  after we have seen the last of this administration. Americans demand and deserve protection of their basic civil rights and this can be  accomplished while providing the means necessary for our intelligence community to do its  job.  ",2008
906,41,2008-06-20,Mr. NADLER.," Madam Speaker, Members of  the House must decide today whether to uphold the rule of low and the supremacy of the  Constitution or whether to protect and reward  the lawless behavior of the administration and  of the telecommunications companies that participated in its clearly illegal program of spying  on innocent Americans.  This bill limits the courts hearing lawsuits alleging  illegal wiretapping  to  consider  only  whether  the  telecom companies  received a  ‘‘written  request or directive  . . .  indicating  that  the activity was  [  ] authorized by  the  President; and [ ] determined to be lawful’’—  not whether the request was actually lawful or  whether the telecom companies knew that it  was unlawful.  The bill is a fig-leaf, granting blanket immunity to the telecom companies for illegal acts  without allowing  the courts  to consider  the  facts or the law. It denies people whose rights  were violated their fair day in court, and it denies the American people their right to have  the actions of the administration subjected to  fair and independent scrutiny.  Even the courts’ limited review will remain  secret. The lawsuits will be dismissed, but the  basis  for  the dismissal—that  the defendants  were  innocent of misconduct, or  that  they  were guilty but Congress commands their immunity—must remain secret.  And  the constitutionality of  the  immunity  granted by  this bill  is very questionable. As  Judge Walker put it in the AT&T case:  AT&T’s alleged actions here violate the  constitutional rights clearly established in  [the] Keith decision. Moreover, because ‘the  very action in question has previously been  held unlawful,’ AT&T cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position  could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal.  in  I rise  I would hope that the courts will find that,  because the Constitutional rights of Americans  have been violated, Congress’ attempt to prevent court review is unconstitutional.  The bill also reiterates than FISA and specified other statutes are the exclusive legal authority for electronic surveillance. The Act has  always said  that. This bill adds some new  mechanisms to ensure that any future legislation may not be read to override this exclusivity by implication, but only by explicitly saying that that is its purpose.  No one and no court should draw the false  conclusion that we are thereby implying that  the exclusivity provision was, or could have  been, overridden either by  the President’s  claim of inherent authority under Article II of  the Constitution, or by the Authorization for the  Use of Military Force of 2001. This bill does  not say or imply that. If there is any doubt of  this point, the blanket immunity provisions of  this bill reflect Congress’ understanding  that  this domestic spying was not legal. If it were,  there would not be any necessity  for  these  provisions.  This bill abandons the Constitution’s protections and insulates lawless behavior from legal  scrutiny.  I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.  ",2008
907,41,2008-06-20,Mr. BOSWELL.," Madam Speaker,  support of H.R. 6304.  This is the kind of work I came to Congress  hoping for—bipartisan legislation that protects  our security and our liberty. It’s a solid compromise that does what it needs to do for the  country.  One of my specific concerns in FISA reform  over the last year has been finding a way to  protect reasonable private companies, who assisted government out of patriotism.  This bill does that. It doesn’t give anyone a  free pass, but it allows companies to come before the courts and make their case in order  to be protected from lawsuits.  That’s a good result, and I thank Chairman  REYES for his work in reaching this reasonable  bipartisan compromise.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’  Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE  of  Florida.  Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  in support of  H.R. 6304, a bill to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  and  to  protect  America from foreign threats.  For the past several months, I have heard  from hundreds of constituents on the issue of  FISA.  Each one of  them expressed  their alarm  and disbelief that the House Majority would repeatedly refuse  to call a vote on bipartisan  legislation  to extend FISA and address our  grave vulnerability to terrorist attacks.  Today I am pleased that the Majority leadership has finally reached across the aisle to put  together a compromise bill, and fulfill one of its  fundamental tasks—to ensure the security of  this great Nation.  This compromise is also a reminder of what  I have always believed, that no one side can  do it alone; both parties must work together to  ensure our safety.

909,48,2008-06-20,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, not so  many years ago two famous American  artists, Josh Stone and Dionne Warwick, created a song called, ‘‘What’s it  all about, Alfie?’’ Here is how the song  began:  ‘‘What’s it all about, Alfie?  Is it just for the moment we live?  What’s it all about when you sort it  out, Alfie?  Are we meant to take more than we  give?’’  On June 19 this week, 2008, the New  York Times lead story said quite a bit  about  taking.  The  headline  reads,  ‘‘Deals With Iraq Are Set To Bring the  Oil Giants Back.’’ I hope every American reads the lead story in the New  York Times this week, June 19, a story  written by Andrew Kramer.  Here is some of what it says. It says  Exxon Mobil, Shell, Total, and BP,  along with some other companies like  Chevron, and a number of smaller oil  companies, are in talks with Iraq’s oil  ministry for no-bid contracts, I repeat,  no-bid contracts to service Iraq’s largest fields. The no-bid contracts are unusual for the industry. Many experts  consider these contracts to be their  best hope for large-scale increases in  production over there. And it talks a  lot about the politics of global oil and  how other places like Bolivia and Venezuela  and Russia  and Kazakhstan  aren’t so friendly to the United States  anymore as we become totally dependent on imported fuel. And it says that  the biggest prize everybody is waiting  for is the development of these new oil  fields.  But of course we have to be careful  because these mother lodes are threatened by insurgents who don’t like the  fact that western companies are coveting their resources. And here we live  in a country now where gas is over $4 a  gallon. It would be so easy just to take  it. And as the song says, are we meant  to take more than we give?  Technically, these no-bid deals, more  no-bid  from this administration, are  structured  as  service  contracts. As  such, they do not require the passage  of an oil law setting out terms for competitive bidding. The  legislation has  been stalled by disputes among Shiites,  Sunni and Kurdish parties over revenue  sharing and other  conditions  inside  that country where their parliament is  in turmoil and cannot pass a hydrocarbon law. And thus, outsiders come  in and are covetous of those resources.  The whole process is designed to circumvent the  legislative stalemate. I  might say, how convenient. How convenient.  And so Americans should ponder the  connection between our dependence.  Now almost 75 percent of what people  pump into their tanks comes from resources from other places, and think  about how serious we had best be as a  country to become energy independent  here at home so we can restore our  independence  again  because  every  American family that can’t afford to  drive to work anymore or go on vacation is less free than they were a year  ago.  And the year 1998 is very important  because that is the year when America  began importing over half of what we  consume. Every year we become less  and less free.  It is really sad what is happening in  the world. I mourn for my country as  we approach  Independence Day that  she is not free. And the way we are  going to fix this is for Americans to  really understand the nature of our  predicament.  I would prefer not to send America’s  finest to wars over oil, but that is exactly what we have done. And it will  cost upwards of a trillion dollars already to pay for their deployment. It is  important to think about the words to  that song: Are we meant to take? I  really think we are meant to create.  The way this country was born out of  people’s highest ideals, to create a Nation that could be self-sustaining within its own borders without all these  interlocking, foreign entailments that  George Washington warned us about  over 200 years ago. Maybe some Americans have forgotten, but we shouldn’t  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:48 Jun 21, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K20JN7.064 H20JNPT1 E S U O H h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l e b j         ",2008

914,55,2008-06-20,Mr. WESTMORELAND.," Thank you,  sir.  You know, I want to just show the  American people: We’re not going to  immediately drill ourselves out of the  spot, Mr. Speaker. But in 1995, the Congress passed drilling in ANWR. President Clinton vetoed it. Had he not vetoed it in 1995 we would be getting one  million barrels of oil  today out of  ANWR.  So is this an immediate relief? No.  It’s immediate relief from, I think, the  speculation  and  the  amount  of  escrowing. But this  is an all-of-the-  above issue. We’ve got to start drilling.  We’ve got to start doing alternative  fuels. We’ve got to build refineries.  We’ve got to be doing onshore and offshore drilling. We’ve got to do coal-to-  liquid. There are a lot of things we  have to do and not just lay here in a  fetal position.  But this is what really burns me up  when I think about being dependent on  foreign oil. This is a picture of Mr.  Chavez from Venezuela and Mr. Castro  from Cuba. In a recent interview on al  Jazeera, Chavez called for developing  nations to unite against U.S. political  and economic policies. ‘‘What We Can  Do Regarding the Imperialistic Power  of the United States.’’  ‘‘We have no  choice but to unite,’’ he said.  ‘‘Venezuela’s energy alliances with nations  such as Cuba, which receives cheap oil  and are an example of how we use oil in  our war against neo  liberalism,’’ he  said. If you saw it on TV this morning,  you saw where he threatened the European nations with no more Venezuelan  oil because they passed an immigration  law that he didn’t like. This guy is not  our friend. The bottom, on March 15,  2005, Washington Post; or as he put it  on another occasion, ‘‘We have invaded  the United States with our oil.’’  Now, I’m fixing to show you something, Mr. Speaker, and I don’t know if  you can see it or not, but maybe you’ll  get a look at it. But Mr. Speaker, I’m  going to show you something that’s  really going to burn you up. This is a  copy of the check that American families and businesses write to Mr. Chavez.  Every day, 365 days a year, we write  him a check for $170,250,000. Mr. Speaker, that’s a crime. We could be writing  those checks  to American men and  women with the jobs that we would  create if we would use our own natural  resources for our own benefit.  So Mr. Speaker, I’ve got 5 minutes to  close. And I want to put up this address, because this address, Mr. Speaker, is for real energy solutions. It’s a  simple  address, www.house.gov/westmoreland. And you can go to that address, Mr. Speaker—and I hope you will  go tonight, Mr. Speaker—and see the  names on there that have signed the  petition, the commonsense petition, a  petition that just says ‘‘I will vote to  increase oil production to  lower the  price of gas for Americans.’’ That’s as  simple as you can get, Mr. Speaker. We  had 32,000 hits on this Web site either  last night or the night before  last.  Americans want to know where their  Congressman represent.  And Mr. Speaker,  let me close by  saying this: So many politicians today  that the American people hear on TV  are talking about change. And I don’t  know if it’s the kind of change that  we’re thinking about because, as an  American citizen, the change that I  hope that Congress or that elected officials would have, Mr. Speaker,  is a  change that they would be honest, that  they would be honest with what they  tell the American people and not come  to Washington and write a bunch of  legislation that’s very confusing about  what it really means.  And I read your excerpts today, Mr.  Speaker, that read what some of your  colleagues had said about the legislation that they passed and what it was  going to do for fuel prices. And some of  that legislation was over a year ago,  and it has just continued, gas is at $4.08  a gallon. But Mr. Speaker, if I could  talk to the American people, I would  tell them this: that there will never  really be any change in this country,  Mr. Speaker, until the people that get  up every morning that are citizens of  this land, that look in the mirror, and  if that person, Mr. Speaker, that they  see in the mirror will not change, then  we’re not going to change.  And so sometimes it takes effort, Mr.  Speaker, from the men and women out  there that watch us and listen to us  and abide by the laws that we make to  take things into their own hands and  to let us know how they feel. Over a  million people have signed a petition,  ‘‘Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less.’’  We’re hearing from them. We need to  hear from you.  Mr. Speaker, if I could talk to the  American people, I would tell them,  your Congressman and your Senator  need to hear from you. You need to  know if they’re willing to vote to increase the production of oil  in this  country  from  our  own natural  resources, be less dependent on foreign  oil and foreign resources, and lower the  price of American gas. And you can  find out if your Congressman is on that  petition or not by going to house.gov/  westmoreland.  You’re going to hear all kind of arguments of why they didn’t sign it or  haven’t  signed  it, but Mr. Speaker,  those arguments are so simple that the  argument doesn’t even hold up.  So Mr. Speaker, with that, I’m going  to yield the well and yield my time  here, and just thank you for your patience in listening to the truth that’s  been brought to you. And thank my  friends that have come down tonight,  my colleagues that have come down to  help me, Mr. Speaker, try to explain to  the American people that we’re serious  about bringing them some relief at the  pump.  f  b1445  PEAK OIL  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  LOEBSACK).

915,55,2008-06-20,Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland.," Mr.  Speaker, I am pleased that my colleagues  for the  last hour helped to  make the point that oil is high and  gasoline is high because there is an imbalance between supply and demand.  There are a lot of differences of opinion  as to how we got here, why we’re here  and what we ought to do to reduce the  price of gas.  The next chart is really an historical  one. This whole saga begins  in 1956  when a geologist of the Shell Oil Company gave a talk to a group of physicians on the 8th day of March in San  Antonio, Texas. And he made a prediction which was an audacious prediction then. At that time, the United  States was the king of oil. We were  producing more oil, using more oil and  exporting more oil  than any other  country in the world. Here we were in  1956. He predicted that just 14 years  later, in 1970, the United States would  reach  its maximum  oil  production.  That was sheer heresy then. Nobody  believed him. He was ridiculed. But  right on schedule, 14 years later, in  1970, the United States peaked in oil  production.  Now he was predicting this for only  the lower 48 States, which is shown  here, Texas plus the rest of the United  States. Then we found a lot of oil in  Alaska. We found some oil in the Gulf  of Mexico. And we learned more and  more how to get oil from natural gas  liquids. By 1980, looking back, you can  see, gee, M. King Hubbert was really  right, wasn’t he? We did reach maximum oil production in 1970. I’m going  to keep coming back to that.

917,69,2008-06-20,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, I  am pleased to hear the majority leader  shares my concern that we do not have  a  fully  functioning Federal Election  Commission.  In  fact, yesterday,  the  Democratic  nominee  for  President  called the system broken. Today is another example of the broken system.  This battle has been going on  for  more than 2 years, believe it or not,  starting with the recess appointment  of  very well-qualified  and well-respected experts in this field. The three  recess  appointments  expired  at  the  first of this year, and two nominees  have ultimately withdrawn, citing the  need for gainful employment, both well  qualified, but one, having been unfairly  and falsely maligned, ended up withdrawing.  So here we are today, after an April  29 commitment by the majority, that a  review of new nominees would be simple and a commitment to speedy review. I know that is what the majority  leader hoped to accomplish but, in fact,  here we are still.  Let me be perfectly clear, we have  gone out of our way, willing to confirm  nominees who many on our side believe  are completely misguided on the matter they would be regulating. But in  the interest of obtaining a fully functioning FEC, it has always been my belief  that  the Democrats pick  their  nominees and we pick ours. I can’t recall ever having made a Democratic  nominee for the Federal Election Commission  ‘‘controversial,’’  but  that  seems not to be the case when Republicans pick nominees. They are  frequently demonized and declared unqualified.  Nevertheless, we are where we are,  and hopefully we can get this done as  rapidly as possible. There always seems  to be a snag, and the snags always  seem to be on the other side. I know  this is something the majority leader  is not happy about. He has just indicated he wants to move forward, and it  is my hope we can get this done as rapidly as possible.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORDan  article citing the Democratic National  Committee’s intent to file yet another  frivolous  lawsuit next Tuesday—one  that  was  dismissed  once  before—  against the FEC, citing their failure to  act on a matter related to Senator  MCCAIN.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.  (See exhibit 1.)  ",2008
918,69,2008-06-20,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, the  only way the DNC can maintain this  suit  is  if there  is a nonfunctioning  FEC. Thus, in order for the DNC’s already failed lawsuit to go forward, this  package must be objected to, and they  have done just that.  I hope this continued delay of getting  a fully constituted FEC is not related  to the fact that the DNC is trying to,  we think, file a lawsuit on Monday.  Those are the kinds of shenanigans  which I don’t think we ought to export  from the campaign to the Senate. In  the Senate, it strikes me we have an  obligation to get this Federal Election  Commission  reconstituted and  functioning, not to try to give one party’s  national committee or another some  kind of advantage in a pending lawsuit.  So I am encouraged by the majority  leader’s desire to get these nominations completed. I know we are not  having votes Monday, but we are in  Monday. It strikes me that Monday  would be a very good time to get these  nominees confirmed,  if,  in  fact, we  can’t do it later today if the snag the  majority  leader  indicated  could  be  cleared up. I know, because he has just  said, he shares my view that we ought  to get this job done, and I think the  best time to do it would be today. The  second best time to do  it would be  shortly after we convene on Monday.  EXHIBIT1  DNC TO AGAIN FILE SUIT ON MCCAIN’S  MATCHING FUNDS  (By Jonathan Martin) June 17, 2008  The DNC will today announce that they intend to file a lawsuit next week in U.S. District Court to spur an FEC  inquiry over  whether John McCain  illegally withdrew  from the federal financing system.  The committee first issued a complaint to  the FEC in February, but in April a federal  judge  ruled  that,  even  though  the FEC  lacked a quorum, they still could convene  before the end of the 120 days they’re given  to examine complaints.  Now, with those 120 days expiring on June  24th, the DNC is acting again in hopes a  judge will compel the FEC to act on their  complaint, as is allowed by law.  At issue is whether McCain locked himself  into spending limits in the primary by putting up anticipated matching funds as collateral for the loan that helped keep his underfunded campaign alive at the end of 2007.  Democrats hope  to puncture a hole  in  McCain’s good government image by pressing the issue while Republicans dismiss it as  totally groundless.  First, though, the FEC needs to have sufficient members to form a quorum. With one  nominee having withdrawn  from consideration last month, the Senate appears to be  finally ready to confirm additional commissioners in the next few weeks.  HONORINGOURARMEDFORCES  LANCECORPORALJUSTIND. SIMS  ",2008
919,69,2008-06-20,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, I  rise to pay tribute to a young man  from my home, the Commonwealth of  Kentucky, who gave his life in the performance of his duty as a U.S. marine.  On April 15, 2006, an improvised explosive device detonated under LCpl Justin Sims’s humvee as he patrolled Al  Anbar Province in Iraq. The Covington,  KY, native was 22 years old.  For his valor in uniform, Lance Corporal Sims  received  several awards,  medals, and decorations, including the  Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the  National Defense Service Medal, and  the Purple Heart.  At a young age, Lance Corporal Sims  had found what many Americans twice  his age are still searching for: his life’s  calling. Justin’s family members agree  that even as a child, he aspired to serve  his country in uniform.  His mother Alma Sims commented  that:  On 9/11, he was a junior in high school. He  said, ‘‘I’d go now if they would take me.’’  You would think he was bred to be a Marine.  From 4 and 5 years old, his favorite movie  was Tour of Duty. The Marines was all he  talked about.  Perhaps Justin was influenced by his  grandfather Coleman Luster, an Army  veteran. Justin  admired his  grandfather’s service, if not necessarily how  he chose to serve.  Alma remembers:  Papaw and Justin would joke around. Justin would say,  ‘‘Army was the best thing  back then, but the Marines rule now.’’ Justin  looked up to Papaw. They were real close.  My dad would always tease me,  ‘‘You did  great raising your boy. Let’s see how these  girls go.’’  These girls were Justin’s four sisters,  all younger than he was. Justin was a  kind and caring older brother, and with  Alma being a single parent, he made  sure to spend a lot of time with his sisters  to make  things easier  for his  mother.  Alma said:  He would take my four girls to school each  day whenever I had to go to work early. I  told him, ‘‘You don’t need to do that because  I have a sitter.’’ But he insisted on taking  care of them. You would think that him  being 11 years older, he wouldn’t want anything to do with them. It was just the opposite. If there was snow on the ground, he  would take all the girls out sledding. There  was no hill too large for him.  Justin started ROTC in the eighth  grade and participated at Holmes High  School. He was a marksman with State  honors for his ROTC rifle unit and participated  in  sharpshooting  competitions all over the country. Neighbors  recall seeing young Justin practicing  how to twirl his rifle in front of his  house. Once he tried to teach one of his  sisters, then only 8 years old, how to  twirl the rifle. She ended up with a big  dent on her forehead.  Alma says:  We still laugh about that today because  they told me she had fallen.  Justin graduated from Holmes High  School in 2003 and later that year enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was  eventually assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary  Force, based out of Camp Lejeune, NC.  Before he left, however, while still in  his  senior  year  at Holmes,  Justin  worked after school at a restaurant.  There, he met a young woman named  Leah, who only worked at the same  restaurant for a week but kept hanging  around to see her friends.  Alma recalls:  He started flirting with her, then told her  he was going to ask her out.  Justin Sims and Leah Matt-Sims  were married on December  26,  2004,  after changing the date a few times because of Justin’s uncertain deployment  schedule.

922,76,2008-06-20,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I rise to  pay  tribute  to  the  service of Paul  Clement, who recently stepped down as  our Nation’s 43rd Solicitor General.  Paul served in that office for more  than 7 years, first as Principal Deputy  to Solicitor General Ted Olson, then as  Acting Solicitor General, and for three  years as Solicitor General. He is a good  man and an excellent lawyer who was a  great Solicitor General.  Before speaking about Paul, let me  first say a few words about the office in  which he served.  Congress created the Department of  Justice and the position of Solicitor  General in 1870. Since then, the Solicitor General is the only Federal Government officer actually required by  statute to be ‘‘learned in the law.’’  As Paul put it during his confirmation hearing in April 2005, the Solicitor  General sits literally at the crossroads  of the separation of powers. He is an  executive branch official who defends  the actions of the executive and legislative  branches  before  the  judicial  branch.  Today,  the Solicitor General  represents the United States before the  Supreme  Court  and manages  the  United States’ participation in thousands of lower court cases. That means  he must make decisions in individual  cases with reference to past positions  taken by the United States and vigilance about how current positions may  affect the future.  Such  a  constant,  and  constantly  changing, set of factors makes the Solicitor General’s job something like the  courtroom  version  of multi-dimensional chess.  Because of his special relationship  with the Supreme Court, the Solicitor  General  is often  referred  to as  the  Tenth Justice. Because of its astounding breadth and depth of experience  and expertise, the Solicitor General’s  office has been called the best law firm  in America.  Paul Clement stands in a line of Solicitors General that includes some of  the true giants in the law and in the  service of our country.  They include many who also served  on the federal bench such as Supreme  Court Chief Justices William Howard  Taft and Charles Evans Hughes; Associate Justices Stanley Reed, Robert  Jackson, and Thurgood Marshall; and  Circuit Judges Kenneth Starr, Wade  McCree, and Walter Cummings.  They include some of America’s most  distinguished legal academics such as  Walter Dellinger, the Maggs Professor  of Law at Duke; the late Erwin Griswold, dean of Harvard Law School for  31 years; and the late Rex Lee, from my  own State of Utah, who was the founding dean of the J. Reuben Clark School  of Law at Brigham Young University.  Past Solicitors General also include  those who would  distinguish  themselves in both the academic and judicial worlds such as Charles Fried, who  has taught at Havard Law School since  1961 and served on the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts; and Robert Bork, who was the Bickel Professor  of Public Law at Yale and served on  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.  Circuit.  Like Paul Clement,  current Chief  Justice John Roberts served as Principal Deputy Solicitor General.  Paul deserves to stand among such  legends.  A native of Cedarburg, WI, Paul graduated  from  the  Cedarburg  public  schools and went on to receive a bachelor’s degree summa cum laude from  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:46 Sep 14, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD08\RECFILES\S20JN8.REC S20JN8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008
923,83,2008-06-20,Mr. BURR.," Mr. President, today I  wish to honor the life of North Carolina  State  Trooper  David  Shawn  Blanton, Jr., who was tragically killed  on June 18 during a routine traffic stop  near Canton, NC. David  is the 59th  North Carolina State Trooper to have  been killed in the line of duty.  David was only 24 years old and was  a 2-year veteran of the North Carolina  Highway Patrol. He was a native of  Sylva, NC, and a  2002 graduate of  Smoky Mountain High School where he  was a football and wrestling star.  We are all grateful for David’s dedication  to protecting  the citizens of  North Carolina. He lived in Cherokee  with his wife Michaela, who had just  given birth to their son Tye 2 weeks  ago.  David was a member of the Eastern  Band of the Cherokee Indian Tribe and  the first member of that tribe to serve  with the Highway Patrol. In addition  to being a State trooper, David volunteered as the Junior Varsity softball  coach  at  Smoky  Mountain  High  School.  Along with his wife Michaela and son  Tye, David is survived by his father,  David S. Blanton, Sr., mother, Jennifer  Blanton, and younger brother, Jesse  Blanton.  David’s friends, family, fellow troopers, and the people of North Carolina  are mourning this very tragic loss.  I know there are no words I can offer  to help comfort Michaela and other  members of the Blanton family, but I  hope my colleagues in the Senate will  join me  in  keeping  them  in  our  thoughts and prayers.  David gave his life in service to our  State,  and  this  ultimate  sacrifice  should never be forgotten.  I send my deepest condolences to all  who had the privilege of knowing this  young man who gave his life in service  to our State.  f  IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH  ENERGY PRICES  ",2008
924,83,2008-06-20,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President, earlier  this week, I asked Idahoans to share  with me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded  by the hundreds. The stories, now numbering over  1,000, are heartbreaking  and touching. To respect their efforts,  I am submitting every e-mail sent to  me  through  energy_prices@crapo  .senate.gov  to  the  RECORD. This is not an issue that will  be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves  immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard.  Their  stories not only detail  their  struggles to meet everyday expenses,  but also have  suggestions and  recommendations as to what Congress can  do now to tackle this problem and find  solutions that last beyond today. I ask  unanimous consent to have printed in  the RECORDtoday’s letters.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  CONGRESSIONAL  SENATORCRAPO: We are not going to be  able to take any time to enjoy our great  state of Idaho this summer as with years  past. The gas to go and return from our favorite spots like Stanley basin, Warm Lake,  McCall’s Ponderosa State Park is just too  much to make it enjoyable. The cost of food  clearly is reflective of the fuel pricing. This  just makes it far too expensive to go anywhere this summer.  I am absolutely disgusted in the way our government is allowing this to happen to the American people.  I look forward to a movement to begin re-  commissioning our own drilling rigs that  still sit idle in the Gulf of Mexico.  I look forward to a movement to begin  drilling on our own land for oil that we all  know is right under our own borders.  I look forward to a movement to release  and discontinue  the excessive  storage of  emergency fuels.  I also know that I am not alone in monitoring the existing administration who will  not lobby for these items I list to be addressed and resolved. It is time we start taking care of our own with our own resources.  This includes limiting the impacts on the  greater population by the loud concerns of a  few groups. With today’s technology we can  certainly drill and protect our environment  and begin to reduce greatly our dependence  on foreign oil(s).  Respectfully,  BILL, Boise.  DEARSENATORCRAPO: As one of those who  voted for you I am pleased to provide a bit of  input on the costs of fuel and the impact on  myself, my family, and my business.  Just like the majority of Idaho families,  our family has been directly impacted by the  very high prices of gasoline and the way it  happened  . . . so quickly and without reprieve or real alternatives.  In my business, I must have a good supply  of gasoline in order to function. I operate a  flight training school for pilots in Nampa.  My costs for fuel are always around $10,000  per year and that is normally my one major  expense associated with my business outside  of the other normal overhead costs any other  business has. Even so, it is the Numero Uno  cost for my business, and now it is about 50%  increased from that already very high price.  What compounds this loss is that so many  people have become too  financially short  that my customer base is very low now.  Normally, in the past 7 years, I would be  looking at a full student schedule, with at  least 3 or 4 on a waiting list. This year, I  have a 20% load and no waiting list. It is  that sparse due to the economy, then compounded by the very high fuel costs.  Thanks  for  the opportunity  to provide  some direct input on the subject to your office.  Sincerely yours,  GARY, Nampa.  DEARSENATOR: The biggest impact that  gas prices has had on me affects our family.  We have six married children and one single  daughter spread throughout the west. One in  Colorado Springs, CO; another in Mesa, AZ;  two in the Orem, UT, area; another in dental  school at Marquette; and two in the Boise  area. We plan a family reunion every summer, which is usually our once-a-year gathering. We have cancelled our reunion this  year, scheduled for Colorado Springs, CO, because of the cost of fuel for everyone. I just  can’t tell you how disappointing it is to all  of us not to have an opportunity to be together this year. We hope that it will not  stop us next year.  I hear all of the reports that America has  ample supplies but legislation and environmentalists prevent us from developing the  natural resources. We are too late for today,  but tomorrow will be here and we need to be  prepared to provide for ourselves. All that  you can do to make this possible is needed  and necessary. Please do your best to make  it happen.  DOUG.  PLEASE pass emergency legislation to exploit America’s natural resources. Authorize  drilling wherever oil companies think there  might be oil or natural gas, authorize nuclear energy and wind power. Set up drilling  stations off America’s shores instead of letting Cuba and China take our oil. Show some  resolve and Yankee ingenuity!  Americans will downsize and conserve—the  market will  take care of  that, but you  should have had us energy independent years  ago. We could be sending money to America  instead of supporting people who do not have  our country’s best interest at heart.

Madam, I cannot pinpoint exactly  when or where  I  first met Ms. Linda Davis;  however, I do recall that we immediately connected and soon were communicating and  working  together  on  various  issues  and  projects.  Linda Davis had an outstanding personality  which was infectious. She could be warm and  disarming but at the same time tough and intimidating. She was energetic and in addition  to looking after her home and family, she was  a regular attendee at community meetings and  events. Mrs. Davis was involved with her block  and immediate neighborhood; I was privileged  to attend meetings and coffees in her home.  She worked with  the Community Bank of  Lawndale,  the Austin Bank of Chicago,  the  Chicago Board of Education and Loretto Hospital as well with the Austin Chamber of Commerce and many other entities.  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take note  of some of the contributions of this noteworthy  citizen, a great wife, wonderful mother and superb human being.  HONORING MARGARET  ‘‘MAGGIE’’  TRUPP FOR HER  41 YEARS OF  MERITORIOUS SERVICE  HON. AL GREEN  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 20, 2008  ",2008
926,97,2008-06-20,Mr. AL GREEN of Texas.," Madam Speaker,  it is my pleasure to honor Margaret ‘‘Maggie’’  Trupp upon the occasion of her retirement following 41 years of meritorious service for Continental Airlines.  Ms. Trupp’s life experience truly represents  the American Dream. After immigrating to the  United States from Holland in 1961 at the age  of 16, she attended Dan McCarty High School  and Indian River Junior College before moving  to my hometown of Houston, Texas, in 1967.  Almost  immediately, Texas  International Airlines, an airline in its infancy, recognized her  talents, work ethic and enthusiasm and hired  her to help move the company forward. Ms.  Trupp has participated in Texas International’s  growth into Continental Airlines, a major international carrier.  Ms. Trupp achieved great success during  her tenure, once receiving the airline’s annual  customer service award and spearheading its  unaccompanied minor system, which has facilitated successful travel for young people. On  a personal note, she has helped me numerous  times over the years in my travel experiences  and has always shown me tremendous generosity and kindness.

NIKI TSONGAS  OFMASSACHUSETTS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 20, 2008  ",2008
927,97,2008-06-20,Ms. TSONGAS.," Madam Speaker, I rise to  honor Reeve Fidler of Groton, Massachusetts,  who will  receive  the Congressional Award  bronze, silver and gold medals. It is my privilege to honor Reeve who has worked to better  himself and his community.  The Congressional Award recognizes initiative, achievement, and service in young people. Reeve exemplifies all of these qualities.  The award’s recipients represent the best of  America—they are committed to self-improvement, hard work, and community service.  Reeve performed over 400 hours of community service, managing the snack shack at his  town’s athletic  fields. The profits he earned  selling concessions went  to  fund  the  town’s  youth soccer program. Reeve also volunteered  as a teacher’s aide at the Groton Children’s  Center.  In addition to helping his community, Reeve  set personal development goals. He received  certification to become a soccer referee and  subsequently worked as an official for youth  games in his town. To complete the physical  fitness  goal, Reeve  played  for  his  high  school’s varsity tennis team, and for his expedition requirement, Reeve explored the coast  of southern Maine.  It  is also  important  to acknowledge  that  Reeve and the other extraordinary young people receiving  the Congressional Award were  not alone in their work to achieve their goals.  Along the way, they were guided by the helping hands of parents, teachers, and mentors,  who provided constant encouragement and  support.  Today, I honor Reeve’s hard work and dedication. His dedication  to community service  and personal development should be admired  and emulated.  f  HONORING SAINT JAMES PARISH  HON. DALE E. KILDEE  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 20, 2008  ",2008
928,97,2008-06-20,Mr. KILDEE.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to recognize Saint James Parish in Bay City  as they dedicate the new parish center, Langley Hall. Bishop Robert J. Carlson will preside  over  the dedication  ceremony on Sunday,  June 22, in Bay City, Michigan.  Reverend Henry Schutjes  founded Saint  James Parish  in 1868  in  response  to  the  needs of a growing Irish community. The parish quickly became the center of life for the  Irish settlers in the Bay City area. In 1873 the  new pastor, Reverend Thomas Rafter, welcomed four Sisters of Charity to teach in the  parish school. On August 25th of  that year,  Saint James Parish opened the first 12-grade,  coeducational parochial school  in  the United  States. The Sisters of Charity had to send additional  teachers as  the enrollment grew  to  400 students within a month.  Education has always been very important  to  the parishioners of Saint James.  In preparing the next generation for the challenges  of  life  the school has gone  through several  transformations. The high school is now part  of All Saints Central High School and the middle  school  is part of Holy Family Middle  School. Since 1873,  the Sisters of Charity  have continued to serve Saint James Parish,  preparing students for an abundant temporal  and spiritual life.  The first wooden church was destroyed by  fire in 1884. The second church was struck by  lightning and burned in 1978. After each tragedy the parishioners came together and continued a vibrant parish life. They found other  places to celebrate Mass and worked to rebuild the sanctuary. The current church was  completed  in 1980 and  the  first Mass was  celebrated on Christmas Eve. This sacred tradition continues under  the  leadership of  the  pastor, Reverend Robert J. DeLand, and associate pastor, Reverend Andrew D. Booms.  On June 22nd the parish will come together  again to celebrate the dedication of the new  parish center, Langley Hall. The parish center  is made possible by the bequest of the late  Norbert Langley and Elizabeth Langley. The  Langley  family exemplifies  the best of Saint  James Parish  life. Their parents, John and  Anna Langley, were married at Saint James  Catholic Church in 1911. They had five children, all baptized at Saint James, and  four  children  graduated  from  the  parish  high  school. Elizabeth and Norbert stayed on the  family farm and continued to attend Mass at  Saint James. Elizabeth passed away in 1998  and Norbert died in 2004. The estate was bequeathed to Saint James, enabling the parish  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:05 Jun 21, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A20JN8.005 E20JNPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 1 6 C P D O R P n o e w o r e         ",2008
929,104,2008-06-20,Mr. DAVIS of Virginia.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  recognize  COL  Brian W.  Lauritzen, the Installation Commander at Fort  Belvoir, Virginia. As a Member of Congress  who represents Fort Belvoir, I know firsthand  that Colonel Lauritzen has served with great  competence,  tireless determination and constant communication with the community during a time of great transition for his installation.  Colonel Lauritzen  took command of Fort  Belvoir, one of our Nation’s largest and most  diverse military installations, in July 2005 with  major challenges awaiting him and even more  on the horizon. Fort Belvoir was already engaged in master planning for redevelopment to  expand the number of Department of Defense  tenants and stretch  the  functions of  the already  busy  installation. Then,  just  a  few  months  into his  tenure,  the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission’s  final  recommendations doubled  the size of  Fort Belvoir’s incoming workforce by 2011.  The BRAC changes at Fort Belvoir, among  the most substantial of BRAC 2005’s mandates, will transform the installation into. the  major support center  for  the Nation’s most  senior military leadership. Ensuring a successful transition has brought with it the great challenges of working with both the Department of  Defense and the local community. These challenges  include  timely and  transparent planning, assessing the environmental and societal  impacts of absorbing more than 19,000 new  employees, managing the transportation infrastructure in an area already burdened by traffic, and ensuring that all of Fort Belvoir’s defense tenants can still perform their vital national security missions.  Colonel  Lauritzen  has  ably met  these  daunting challenges with  the superb attitude  that,  in order  to be successful, Fort Belvoir  must continue to be receptive and responsive  to the concerns of all of the surrounding communities. His early promise to the community  that there would be ‘‘no daylight between us’’  has held  true. Colonel Lauritzen established  the BRAC Board of Advisors, a first-in-the-nation group bringing together members of the  Army,  incoming agencies, and  the  region’s  elected officials and  local civic activists  to  identify development  issues and keep open  the lines of communication.  I have always found Colonel Lauritzen to be  the consummate consensus builder. He personally has made more than 150 appearances  and presentations before community groups to  keep them apprised of the BRAC expansion,  Fort Belvoir’s other missions, and their impact  on  the community. Similarly, he built strong  communication coalitions with and between  the major commands headquartered at Fort  Belvoir  in support of  their people and  their  global missions through the Installation Senior  Leadership Council.  More  than  just  communication, Colonel  Lauritzen continues to facilitate progress, even  when progress is difficult. He worked directly  with Fairfax and Prince William Counties, the  Virginia Department of Transportation, and the  Army Corps of Engineers to address some of  the many transportation challenges facing the  region. Especially noteworthy is his personal  involvement to secure an agreement to complete the extension of the Fairfax County Parkway, a vital connection across the Fort’s Engineer Proving Ground, something that had festered unresolved for more than 10 years.  Inside  the perimeter of his base, Colonel  Lauritzen has steadfastly insisted that our Nation’s Soldiers and their families deserve the  highest quality of life. Fort Belvoir has one of  the Army’s most successful Residential Community Initiative programs that has revitalized  the approach to military housing and neighborhood centers, creating first-class communities  for those who serve our Nation in uniform.  On a more personal note, Colonel Lauritzen  and his staff have eagerly addressed questions or constituent concerns  that my office  has brought to their attention. Regardless of  how complicated or  involved  these requests  may have been, I have always found his door  to be open to discuss the issues and, more  often than not, find compromise to difficult situations.  Madam Speaker, at Fort Belvoir’s Change  of Command Ceremony on Tuesday, July 2,  Colonel Lauritzen—West Point graduate, Soldier, and extraordinary officer—will retire from  the Army and enter a new chapter in his life.  I have  truly enjoyed working with him, and  wish him all the best as he pursues new endeavors. He has truly served Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and our Nation with the highest standards of leadership expected from the very best  of our military commanders.  f  SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS  ACT, 2008  SPEECHOF  HON. CANDICE S. MILLER  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 19, 2008  ",2008
930,104,2008-06-20,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker, the  Michigan Department of Labor and Economic  Growth yesterday shocked Michigan when  it  released its unemployment figures. Michigan’s  unemployment rate has risen from 6.9 percent  in April to 8.5 percent in May. This is the highest rate in our State since October of 1992.  Regrettably, we are now one month away  from recording our eighth straight year of payroll job losses.  It is in this context that my constituents are  hearing  the news  that Congress  is debating  providing  additional  unemployment  benefits  which are desperately needed by  too many  working families in my State. Last week this  House passed H.R. 5749, the Emergency Extended  Unemployment  Compensation  Act,  with nearly 2⁄3of the Members of the House  voting in favor. This bill would provide an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits to  unemployed workers  in every State. Unemployed workers  in States with exceptionally  high unemployment rates, like Michigan, would  receive an additional 13 weeks of benefits beyond that. Unfortunately, the provision granting  workers in States like Michigan an additional  13 weeks of benefits, which  received very  strong bipartisan support in the House just last  week, is not included in this supplemental appropriations bill.  The unemployment benefits provision in this  supplemental  provides  just  13  additional  weeks for every State. It does not provide any  extra help  for States  that need  it  the most.  States  like Michigan where  the unemployed  are having great difficulty  finding work because there are so few jobs to be had. Workers have  little opportunity  to move  to other  areas to find work because they can’t sell their  homes, and they are having difficulty driving  far distances  to  try and  find a new  job because of the high cost of gas. Michigan, with  the worst unemployment rate  in  the Nation,  needs extra help. This supplemental does not  provide it.  I will be supporting both sections of the supplemental. It provides equipment and pay for  our troops in harm’s way and educational benefits for them when they return home. And the  level of aid to the unemployed all across the  country  is a good start. However,  I am disappointed we have not provided  the much  needed extra assistance to those who need it  most. We must continue to work to help the  chronically unemployed to get that additional  safety net that will help support countless families in Michigan.  f  RECOGNIZING THE HONORABLE  ANDREW L. JEFFERSON, JR.  HON. AL GREEN  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 20, 2008  ",2008
931,104,2008-06-20,Mr. AL GREEN of Texas.," Madam Speaker,  it is my privilege to recognize a distinguished  academic, activist, and advocate, my  friend,  the Honorable Andrew L. Jefferson, Jr. The  passage of H. Res. 31, which recognizes the  Honorable Andrew L. Jefferson on the occasion of  the establishment of The Andrew L.  Jefferson Endowment  for Trial Advocacy at  Texas Southern University’s Thurgood Marshall School of Law,  is a  fitting  tribute  to a  man whose life exemplifies excellence and integrity.  The Honorable Andrew L. Jefferson, a native of Dallas, Texas, graduated from the University of Texas School of Law in 1959 after  earning his Bachelor’s degree  from Texas  Southern University, was president of Alpha  Phi Alpha  fraternity, and became a partner  with the law firm of Washington and Jefferson  in Houston, Texas.  He served as an assistant criminal district  attorney for Bexar Country, a chief assistant  United States Attorney for the Western District  of Texas, and a trial counsel and labor relations counsel  for Humble Oil and Refining  Company. In 1970, Judge Jefferson was appointed to preside over the Court of Domestic  Relations number 2  for Harris County.  In  1974, he was elected to Judge of the 208th  District Court.  In 1975, he decided to re-enter the active  practice of law and was admitted to the United  States Court of Appeals  for Fifth, Sixth and  Eleventh Circuits, and the Supreme Court of  the United States of America.

935,6,2008-07-08,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Speaker, both  the Preserve America and the Save  America’s Treasures Programs provide  Federal matching grants for important  historic preservation projects. Preserve  America provides grants for interpretation and education regarding historic  resources, while the Save America’s  Treasures Program provides grants for  rehabilitation in restoration work.  Both  programs, Mr. Speaker,  are  enormously successful because they leverage  limited  Federal  dollars  for  much larger State, local, and private  investment  in preserving and  interpreting our history and our heritage.  These programs were created by executive order, and this legislation simply  provides  statutory authorization  for  both of these programs. H.R. 3981 is a  top priority for the Bush administration.  I ask my colleagues to support passage of this measure.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2008
936,6,2008-07-08,Mr. WITTMAN  of  Virginia.," Mr.  Speaker, Preserve America has been an  administration initiative that encourages and supports community efforts  to preserve cultural and natural heritage. Preserve America communities in  Virginia’s First Congressional District  include Prince William County, Spotsylvania County,  and Williamsburg,  Virginia.  The Save America’s Treasures Program provides grants preserving certain historic sites and collections including Kenmore Mansion  in Fredericksburg and the restoration of the  original military campaign tents used  by George Washington that are now  currently on display at the Colonial  National Historic Park in Yorktown,  Virginia.  I would like to acknowledge the positive contributions that have been made  to  responsible preservation, particularly by Mr. TURNERof Ohio who has  long promoted property rights as a key  component  of  these  programs. Mr.  TURNER’s contribution to this legislation has brought us to where we are  today by ensuring the constitutional  rights of private property owners while  promoting historic and cultural preservation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2008
937,6,2008-07-08,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  such time as he may consume to the  gentleman  from North Carolina  (Mr.  MILLER), the bill’s sponsor.  b1430  Mr. MILLER of North Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Preserve America and Save America’s  Treasures Act, which will, as the two  speakers already have said, authorize  two programs that are critical to the  future of America’s historic preservation efforts.  I want to thank Chairman RAHALL  and Ranking Member YOUNG of the  Natural Resources Committee, as well  as Chairman GRIJALVA and Ranking  Member BISHOPof the National Parks,  Forests  and  Public  Lands  Subcommittee,  for  their work  in  shepherding this legislation, as well as the  historic preservation community  for  their support for this bill.  The Save America’s Treasures Program was started as part of the White  Mr. MIKETURNER House Millennium Council chaired by  then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. The  program  has  provided much-needed  bricks and mortar support and has succeeded beyond anyone’s expectations,  funding America’s most  threatened  cultural treasures for almost 10 years.  The  current administration, under  the  leadership of First Lady Laura  Bush, created  the Preserve America  Program to support community preservation efforts by providing funding for  heritage  tourism  and  preservation  planning.  The  two programs  serve different  purposes, and together, they provide a  comprehensive approach to preservation and community revitalization.  and I announced  the Preserve America and Save America’s Treasures Act in the Sewall-Belmont House, just a couple of blocks  from here. The Sewall-Belmont House  was  designated  a  national  historic  landmark for its significance in American history. It was the headquarters  for the National Woman’s Party, led by  Alice Paul, and their movement to secure women the right to vote.  Despite that obvious historical significance, it was not long ago that the  Sewall-Belmont House was threatened  by a leaking roof and by significant  other structural damage. The Sewall-  Belmont House was the first building  to receive funding as a Save America’s  Treasures project.  In my own district, Save America’s  Treasures funding has helped preserve  the F.W. Woolworth Building in downtown Greensboro. Mr. Speaker, as you  know well, on February 1, 1960, four African American students  from North  Carolina A&T University sat down at  the ‘‘white only’’ lunch counter and refused to move until they were treated  the same as the white customers.  Within 2 months, the sit-ins at Woolworth’s  inspired  similar  demonstrations throughout the South involving  thousands of protesters. The sit-in at  the Woolworth’s lunch counter was the  moment when the civil rights struggle  in this country became a mass movement.  The Woolworth Building  and  its  lunch counter are sacred grounds of the  civil rights movement and must be preserved for future generations.  The Preserve America Program has  designated more  than  500 neighborhoods, cities, and towns throughout the  United States  as Preserve America  Communities and has awarded grants  since 2006. Earlier this year, the Department of the Interior made its first  round of 2008 grants of $2.9 million to 43  projects in 25 States. This September  they will award an additional $4.3 million  in grants. The projects support  heritage tourism, the commercial revitalization of neglected downtowns, and  the reuse of historic properties.  Mr.  Speaker,  America’s  historic  places remind us of who we are. They  remind us of our history. We cannot  cheat our children of that connection  with their past, that understanding of  who they are.

938,13,2008-07-08,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of H.R. 4199, which would expand the  Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical  Park to include additional sites associated with  the  lives and work of Wilbur and Orville  Wright.  Few  technological advances have  transformed the world or our nation’s economy, society, culture, and national character as  the  development of powered flight. Therefore, it is  important to preserve the historical sites associated  the Wright brothers’ achievements  in  the field of aviation. That is what this bill will  do.  Over the years, the Ohio congregational delegation has worked together to preserve and  promote Ohio’s  rich aviation history. A  few  years ago,  I, along with Congressman Tony  Hall, had the privilege of introducing the bill  that later became law to designate eight Miami  Valley counties and the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park as part of a National Aviation Heritage Area. Today, I commend my  colleague,  Congressman MIKE  TURNER, for his leadership in sponsoring this  bill to add two additional sites to the aviation  park.  Specifically, H.R. 4199 will add Hawthorne  Hill, which was Orville Wright’s home in Oakwood, and several Wright Factory buildings in  Dayton, where  the brothers  conducted  research and testing. These sites would be part  of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, which already includes such historic sites as: Huffman Prairie Flying Field, the  Wright Cycle Company Complex, and the Paul  Laurence Dunbar House.  Together,  these  sites are an important part to nation’s history,  and Ohio’s cultural heritage.  Again, I commend Congressman TURNER for  his leadership to preserve and promote Ohio’s  aviation heritage with  this  legislation, and  I  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 4419.

A native of Bremen, Georgia, Paul was a  shining star in his community. A starter on the  football  team and committed  thespian, Paul  was voted ‘‘best personality’’ by his graduating  class of 2002. After graduation, Paul attended  North Georgia College and State University, a  military college.  Tragically, on August 15, 2005, Sergeant  Saylor lost his life while serving as part of the  National  Guard’s  48th  Infantry  in  Al  Mahmudiyah, Iraq.  Described by his brother, Jamie, as  the  ‘‘. . . type who would  help  you,  but  he  wouldn’t  let you know  it,’’ Sergeant Saylor  served his family, community, and country with  selfless devotion.  I rise today in honor of not only a tremendous patriot, but an outstanding citizen.

954,27,2008-07-08,Mr. CAZAYOUX.," Madam Speaker, I  gladly join Congressman MATHESON in  our discussion  regarding a balanced  comprehensive energy policy that the  Blue  Dogs  such  as  Congressman  MATHESONand others support.  I believe that the high price of gasoline is an immediate problem that requires both swift action and long-term  planning. It is the number one issue  facing America today. It is one that  hits home every time that we fill up  our vehicles to go to work, when we attempt to go on summer vacation, and  even when we go to the store to buy  food.  I support expanding domestic drilling  in the Outer Continental Shelf and in  ANWR. This will not only reduce our  dependence on foreign oil and lower gas  prices, it will help our economy and  create jobs. In fact, in Louisiana it was  recently announced  that a new oil  lease in the Gulf of Mexico would generate $78 million for Louisiana to restore its coast.  I believe that one of the root problems of the high price of gasoline is our  outdated  refining  capacity. That  is  why I support building new and improved  refineries  and  updating  old  ones. We haven’t had a new refinery  built since 1972. We have to do a better  job at allowing companies  to build  these refineries and incentivizing companies to build refineries so that we  can expand our refinery capacity and  stop importing refined gas and refined  oil.  In addition to the issue of supplying  gas prices, a strengthening economy  and subsequently a strengthened dollar  will also go a long way to improving  fuel prices. I believe, and the experts  support this, deficit spending is one of  the root causes of our reduced dollar,  and that is playing a huge role, I believe, in the price of oil and the subsequent price of gas in our economy. If  we  can  start  spending within  our  means in Congress, we believe that the  dollar will become a stronger dollar,  we can buy more foreign oil, because  we are now importing 60 percent of our  oil, we can do that in a more effective  way and, therefore, the price of gas  should go down.  But the talk of drilling, we should  not stop there. That approach is a narrow approach. It is an approach I support, but it is not the end all. We have  to have a multi-pronged approach to  reach energy independence and security in the long term as well as the  short term. That is why we voted to increase the oil supply by temporarily diverting oil shipments from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Experts estimate this will lower gas prices anywhere from 5 cents to 24 cents, and this  just went into effect this past week and  hopefully we will see some real lowered  costs at the pump very shortly.  Also,  I  personally  voted  for  an  amendment to the Congressional Budget Resolution that would open up drilling  in ANWR and the Outer Continental Shelf.  We as a body passed the Gas Price  Relief for Consumers Act, and that allows the Justice Department to investigate foreign oil companies who conspire to drive up prices for American  consumers.  We passed the Renewable Energy and  Job Creation Act of 2008, which will  help reduce our dependence on foreign  oil by providing tax credits for renewable energy, including solar, biomass,  geothermal, hydropower, and wind. We  need to be aggressive in making sure  that we harness the technological energy of our Nation, and this bill goes a  long way in doing that.  We passed the Energy Markets Emergency Act, which directs  the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  to use all its powers, including emergency powers, to determine whether  excessive speculation in energy futures  markets is driving the price of oil up.  We passed the farm bill, which included a strong provision for biofuel  production. And we know, the experts  suggest  that, without  the  use  of  biofuels, we would see gas prices 15 percent higher than they are now.  The bottom line is we need to work  hard to create energy  independence.  That work must start today. In the  words of one of my constituents: These  cars just won’t run on hope.  So we need to act to continue to increase domestic drilling, to  increase  our  ability  to harness  our  technological energy that America has succeeded in solving most of our problems  and all of our problems in the past.  And so we need to bring relief to hardworking Americans by  reducing gas  prices now.  ",2008
955,27,2008-07-08,Mr. MATHESON.,"  I thank my colleague. And I appreciate the fact that  my  colleague  from Louisiana highlighted the notion that there is not a  single action that we need to take;  that in fact we need a comprehensive  effort, we need to look at a series of  different opportunities to try to address both the supply and the demand  side. And I appreciate his leadership on  the issue and want to thank him for  joining us in the Blue Dog hour.  Right now I recognize my colleague  from Kansas, a  long-time Blue Dog,  Congressman MOORE.  (Mr. MOORE of Kansas asked and  was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2008
956,27,2008-07-08,Mr. MOORE  of  Kansas.," Madam  Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Utah, thank you for presiding here. I  want to talk for just a few moments  about this energy crisis that our country faces.  Madam Speaker, I am the policy cochair for a group called the Blue Dog  Coalition, which is using some of the  time tonight, and I appreciate my colleagues being here to discuss the energy situation in our country.  Shortly after the last election when  in fact there was a change in the majority in the House and the Democrats  took control, the cochairs of the Blue  Dog group and a group called the New  Democratic Coalition, which I also belong to; I am not  in the  leadership  there, but I have belonged to that since  I have been in Congress for my tenth  year now, we were  invited over  to  speak to the President about policy.  And this was the first time that we had  been invited over to speak about policy. We had been invited for several  other ceremonial things, but not about  policy. So I really appreciated the opportunity to talk with the President.  In fact, the four leaders of the Blue  Dog group met up in my office to talk  about some ground rules since we only  had  a  45-minute meeting with  the  President. So we talked about how long  we would take each if we had a chance  to talk at all, and we decided we would  each take about 2 minutes. And we  talked and went through our  items  there.  But when we were leaving after this  45-minute meeting, the President was  walking beside me. We were walking  out the front door of the White House,  and I said, ‘‘Mr. President, you have an  opportunity to be a hero to people in  this country and maybe a few people  around the world.’’ And he said, ‘‘Well,  how is that?’’  I said,  ‘‘Mr. President, do you remember, a little more than 30 years  ago there was a man on television one  night talking to the American people  about the long lines at the gas pumps.  He had a cardigan sweater on sitting in  front of the fireplace. His name was  Jimmy Carter.’’ And  the President  said, ‘‘I remember that.’’ I said, ‘‘Mr.  President, President Carter said what  we need is a comprehensive energy policy.’’  And, you know, President Carter was  right then, and I have faulted every  Democratic and Republican President  since President Carter for not doing  what he said we needed to do back  then, because that was the right thing.  And what  happened was President  Carter made a few recommendations to  Congress, and Congress passed a couple  little things like the solar panels tax  credit and a few other things. But a few  months after President Carter talked  to the American people, the long lines  at the gas pumps went down, and I  have said that every American adult in  this country got attention deficit disorder and forgot about what he said.  b2000  And I wish we had done that back  then, and I wish we had done that and  had concentrated on that every year  since then because we’d be in a whole  different position as a Nation on the  energy issue right now in this world.

957,34,2008-07-08,Mr. ROSKAM.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding. Thank you for the time.  I  am  absolutely  convinced, Mr.  Speaker, that this is a pivotal time in  our public life and it’s a pivotal time  that doesn’t come along very often, the  sense  of  clarity  that  has  emerged  across the country when gasoline  is  now knocking on the door of $4.50 a  gallon all across the country. Today as  I left Wheaton, Illinois, $4.17 a gallon.  As I’m out in town hall meetings, as  I’m  literally walking  in the parades  over the 4th of July, everybody is coming together and saying, look, let’s do  something about this. And rather than  having this whole opportunity just be  squandered away, we have got an opportunity to move forward. And, unfortunately, the orthodoxy that is developed on the other side of the aisle is  what my predecessor, Henry Hyde, used  to call ‘‘government by bumper sticker.’’ ‘‘Government by bumper sticker’’  says put cute  little phrases on the  backs of cars and that’s the policy that  is going to drive our country. Well,  that’s great. Bumper stickers are nice  and cute when it’s at $2.50 a gallon. But  in my district you know what people  are saying? Rip the bumper stickers off  and let’s get serious about bringing a  national policy as it relates to energy  independence for the United States of  America so that we’re not creating the  same  elements of great  risk where  right now, as you know, we are funding  both sides of the war on terror. When  we go to the gas pump and the money  that we are putting in and the taxes  that we are paying, yes, we’re protecting ourselves from terrorism. We  are protecting ourselves with homeland  security and domestic security efforts  and our whole military infrastructure.  But we are also putting money in the  hands of regimes that are hostile, that  are exporting terrorism and are being  very provocative on the world stage.  So, Mr. Speaker, we have got a  chance today in this Congress to bring  together a wide-ranging coalition that  has an interest and a desire to move  forward on energy independence, and I  think that the time is now. Part of it  has to be exploring and continuing to  unlock American resources. Part of it  has to be that. You can’t do the math.  You can’t ultimately come up with the  types of solutions that are going to  satisfy our energy needs and simply ignore the resources that are available in  the Arctic,  the  resources  that  are  available  in  the Outer Continental  Shelf. So that has got to be part of it.  Part of it is we have got to put nuclear power back  into this mix. We  have had great obstacles in the past as  it relates to nuclear energy. Look at  France. They have done a tremendous  job harnessing that energy, moving it  in ways that don’t have the same types  of emissions problems that other elements do. Nuclear energy has to be a  part of it.  The types of funding resources that  would be available if we were to unlock  those American resources that I talked  about a minute ago could fund many of  the R and D types of projects. Let me  tell you about one in my district. I represent an  institution called the Gas  Technology  Institute, GTI,  in Des  Plaines, Illinois. It’s a wonderful program,  a  public/private  partnership.  They are the types of folks that are  doing the R and D that  looks  into  emerging technologies, and then they  help hand that off to industry and applied science. They have got a technology that they are on the verge of  that is an anti-idling technology. So  here’s what happens: If you’re a commercial truck, if you’re a commercial  bus, they waste tremendous energy as  they are idling, as they are at stoplights and moving and not moving in  traffic. Well, the technology that GTI  is developing moves this so that in a  nutshell it’s a solid-fuel oxide that literally saves us in terms of the amount  of energy that’s used, the emissions  that are emitted. It’s that type of R  and D that can undergird the types of  things that the gentleman from Georgia has been talking about, Mr. Speaker.  There is a whole host of opportunities here, and it’s dynamic. The public  knows it. The public is crying out for  what? The public is crying out for this  body to act, for this body to get over  the nonsense of ‘‘government by bumper sticker,’’ and to say, look, we can all  come together. And we can get 218  Members, a majority of this House, to  come  together around  commonsense  ideas that strive for American energy  independence. The gentleman from Illinois my colleague Mr. SHIMKUS has  been a table pounder  for clean coal  technology. That can transform not  only our region of the country in being  an exporter, but it can literally transform how the United States begins to  look in the future. So the opportunities  are there.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I’m very hopeful about what can come  out of this. But it only comes out if  there is a political will that develops  that says we are going to put 218 votes  up on that board and we’re going to  move the ball for the American public.  ",2008

959,55,2008-07-08,Mr.  COBURN.," Mr. President,  232  years ago the Declaration of Independence established that humans have the  right  to  self-government because of  their unalienable rights to life, liberty  and  the  pursuit  of happiness. Preserving these principles requires the  same wisdom, courage and spirit of sacrifice  that  characterized many  18th  century Americans.  ‘‘What will our children say,’’ wrote  Boston attorney Josiah Quincy II in  1768, ‘‘When they read the history of  these times, should they find we tamely gave away, without one noble struggle,  the most  invaluable of earthly  blessings? . . . let us . . . swear we will  die, if we cannot live freemen!’’  Indeed, the Americans chose to fight  nobly and courageously. After the British surrender at the Battle of Saratoga,  Lord Chatham, a member of the British  House of Lords, concluded,  ‘‘I know  that the conquest of English America  is an impossibility. You cannot, I venture to say  it, you cannot conquer  America . . .’’  These principles to which the representatives of the 13 colonies pledged  their lives, their resources, and their  honor still apply to our Nation today.  It was on this day, July 8, 1776, that  the Declaration of Independence was  first read publicly, having been unanimously adopted by the Congress only 4  days before.  So, today, I am pleased to join with  my colleague Senator LIEBERMAN in  starting a new, bipartisan tradition in  the U.S. Senate. We will read the Declaration of Independence again.  During the next hour, we will also  hear from important leaders in our Nation’s history who saw these principles  of  liberty,  equality, and  justice as  timeless.  Patrick Henry urges us to consider  the consequences of weakly submitting  to a tyrannical authority in the hopes  of obtaining peace, rather than persisting in the fight to secure our freedom. In his famous speech at the Touro  Synagogue, George Washington establishes the importance of religious freedom for the Nation.  A few days before his inauguration,  Abraham Lincoln makes an impromptu  speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where he argues that the principles of the Declaration are incompatible with slavery. Finally, in his last  letter, Thomas Jefferson  reflects on  the significance of the Declaration and  its timeless value.  I ask unanimous consent that Senator LIEBERMANand myself may enter  into a colloquy on the reading of the  Declaration of Independence and that  following  our  colloquy,  Senators  WHITEHOUSE, MURKOWSKI, WEBB, MARTINEZ, and LIEBERMANbe, in that order,  speakers for the remainer of morning  business.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.  ",2008
960,55,2008-07-08,Mr. COBURN.," ‘‘When in the Course of  human events, it becomes necessary for  one people  to dissolve  the political  bands which have connected them with  another, and  to assume among  the  powers of the earth, the separate and  equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them,  a decent respect to the opinions of  mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to  the separation.’’  ",2008
961,55,2008-07-08,Mr. LIEBERMAN.,"  ‘‘We hold  these  truths to be self-evident, that all men  are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain  unalienable Rights, that among these  are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of  Happiness.—That  to  secure  these  rights, Governments  are  instituted  among Men, deriving their just powers  from the consent of the governed.—  That whenever any Form of Government  becomes  destructive  of  these  ends, it is the Right of the People to  alter or to abolish it; and to institute  new Government, laying its foundation  on such principles and organizing its  powers in such form, as to them shall  seem most likely to effect their Safety  and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will  dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light  and transient causes; and accordingly  all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while  evils  are  sufferable,  than  to  right  themselves by abolishing the forms to  which they are accustomed. But when  a long train of abuses and usurpations,  pursuing invariably the same Object,  evinces a design to reduce them under  absolute Despotism, it is their right, it  is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for  their future security.—Such has been  the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such  is now the necessity  which constrains them to alter their  former Systems of Government.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE  AMENDMENTS  ACT  OF  2008  ",2008
971,62,2008-07-08,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. President, I rise  today in opposition to final page of this  legislation, H.R. 6304, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  of  1978,  FISA, Amendments Act of 2008, if it is  not amended to change the retroactive  immunity provisions.  The President must have the necessary authority to track terrorists,  intercept  their communications, and  disrupt their plots. Our Nation still  faces individuals and groups that are  determined to do harm to Americans,  as well as our interests throughout the  world.  I have spent many hours at the National Security Agency, which is located in Fort Meade, MD. The men and  women of our intelligence agencies are  dedicated  public  servants who  are  doing a great job on behalf of their  country. They are trying to do their  jobs correctly, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have received classified briefings about the advice and requests that  were given to the telecommunications  companies by the U.S. Government. I  have seen the opinions of counsel on  this issue. I have attended numerous  hearings on this issue.  Congress must indeed make needed  changes  to  FISA  to  account  for  changes in technology and rulings from  the FISA Court involving purely international  communications  that  pass  through telecommunications routes in  the United States. While we have a solemn obligation to protect the American people, we must simultaneously  uphold the Constitution and protect  our civil liberties.  After  learning  about  executive  branch abuses in the 1960s and 1970s,  Congress  passed  very  specific  laws  which  authorize  electronic  surveillance. Congress has regularly updated  these measures over the years to provide the executive branch the tools it  needs to investigate terrorists, while  preserving essential oversight mechanisms for the courts and the Congress.  FISA requires the Government to seek  an order or warrant  from the FISA  Court before conducting electronic surveillance that may involve U.S. persons.  The  act  also  provides  for  postsurveillance notice  to  the FISA  Court by the Attorney General in an  emergency.  I am very concerned that the FISA  law was disregarded by the administration, and want to ensure that we put an  end to this type of abuse. We are a nation of laws and no one is above the  law, including the President and Attorney General.  The  President  deliberately bypassed the FISA Court for  years with his warrantless wiretapping  program—long after any emergency period directly following the 9/11 terrorist  attacks—and did not ask Congress to  change  the FISA  statute.  In  fact,  President Bush refused to fully brief  Congress on the Terrorist Surveillance  Program, TSP, the existence of which  was only exposed through a New York  Times story. After the story broke, the  administration reluctantly agreed to  place this program under the supervision of the FISA Court.  I do believe that many of the telecommunications companies cooperated  with the Government in good faith, and  may be entitled to relief. But the FISA  statute of 1978 already lays out procedures for the Government to seek a  court order and present this order to  the telecommunications companies and  require their assistance. The 1978 FISA  statute also provides certain immunities to telecommunications companies  that provide this type of assistance to  the Government.  The President chose to  ignore the  FISA statute. If the President did not  want to use the FISA statute or wanted to change it, he had the responsibility to come to Congress and ask for  that change. He cannot change the law  by fiat, or by issuing a Presidential  signing  statement.  Congress  must  change the law, and the courts must  interpret the  law. Congress and the  courts have the power, and often the  responsibility,  to disagree with  the  President, and these co-equal branches  have the constitutional checks to override his veto, disapprove of a request  for a warrant, or strike down an action  as unconstitutional.  I will vote against retroactive immunity for the telecommunications companies. The current bill only authorizes  the district court to review whether  the  companies  received written  requests from the U.S. Government stating that the activity was authorized by  the President and determined to be  lawful by the executive branch. The  Court would have to simply accept the  executive branch’s conclusion that the  warrantless wiretapping outside of the  FISA statute and without FISA Court  approval was legal, which means the  executive branch—not the judiciary—  gets to decide whether the law was broken. I want the courts to be able to  look at what the executive branch is  doing. I want the court to protect individual rights. Granting this type of immunity would violate the basic separation of powers. It would also create a  dangerous precedent for future administrations and private actors to violate  the law, and then seek relief in Congress or from the President through an  after-the-fact amnesty or pardon.  There was a way to provide the telecommunications companies with appropriate  relief. Senator FEINSTEIN’s  amendment would have allowed  the  courts  to grant  relief  to  the  telecommunications  companies  if  they  acted reasonably under the reasonable  assumption that the Government’s requests were  lawful. This amendment  would have preserved the independent  judgment of the  judiciary, and preserved the necessary check and balance  in our system of government. Unfortunately, the negotiators for this legislation rejected this compromise.

973,69,2008-07-08,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, I note only  before we go into that break that the  Senator from Pennsylvania has made a  number of comments on time for the  supporters of the bill that actually deserve a response.  One clear point  that needs  to be  made in response to the Senator from  Pennsylvania and  the Senator  from  California is that Judge Walker’s actions will not be dismissed  if retroactive liability protection is accorded  carriers. It is a case against the United  States, not a case against the telephone companies.  Furthermore, I would say that the  dictum in Judge Walker’s opinion is  contrary to higher, more authoritative  courts. So Judge Walker was not correct, and I believe should his case go up  on appeal, he will be found not to be  accurate. But that does not go, as my  colleague from West Virginia has said,  to the issue of whether carriers deserve  retroactive  liability protection. So I  will reserve my comments, and I will  ask to be recognized when—when will  the Senate return to session?  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. At 2:15 p.m.  ",2008

982,90,2008-07-08,Mr. LEAHY.," I believe the rule of law  is important. I trust our courts to handle even the most difficult and sensitive disputes. That is the courts’ role  in our constitutional scheme, not ours.  Title II of this bill would have Congress  decide these cases by legislative fiat.  We do not want to diminish our Federal judiciary and risk selling out large  numbers of Americans whose  fundamental rights may have been violated.  We  should  not  pass  this  bill  unamended. I urge my colleagues to  cast a vote for accountability and support the Dodd-Feingold-Leahy amendment.  I strongly oppose the immunity provisions contained  in this bill, and I  have supported every effort to strike  them. But if we cannot eliminate these  ill-advised provisions, then I agree that  Senator  amendment  to  delay a decision on  immunity until  after the inspectors general have conducted their review of the warrantless  surveillance  program  makes  good  sense.  I worked hard to include the inspectors general amendment as a part of  this FISA bill. For that provision to  have its full effect, we should delay any  grant of retroactive immunity until we  know what the final report says.  Senator  amendment  would stay all pending cases against  the telecom companies related to the  warrantless surveillance program and  delay the effective date of the immunity provisions in title II of the bill  until 90 days after Congress receives  the inspectors general reports.  I have maintained throughout this  debate that it makes little sense for  Senators—many who have never been  given the opportunity to view key documents  relevant  to  the warrantless  surveillance program—to cast an uninformed vote on retroactive immunity.  That is buying a pig in a poke. To mix  farm metaphors, the Bingaman amendBINGAMAN’s  BINGAMAN’s  ment puts the horse back in front of  the cart.  First, let’s get the facts. And then,  only after reviewing the relevant facts  that the administration claims support  granting retroactive immunity, determine whether Congress should attempt  to legislatively determine the result of  the 40 or so Federal cases alleging violations of fundamental rights of Americans.  Again, I believe the retroactive immunity provisions in this bill should be  stripped entirely. But if that cannot be  accomplished, then I support Senator  BINGAMAN’s amendment as a commonsense way to ensure that the Senate  makes a fully informed decision on retroactive immunity.  I yield the floor.  ",2008

990,90,2008-07-08,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The amendment is as follows:  (Purpose: To limit retroactive immunity for  providing assistance to the United States  to instances in which a Federal court determines the assistance was provided in  connection with an  intelligence activity  that was constitutional)  On page 90, strike lines 17 through 21 and  insert the following:  ‘‘(1) REVIEWOFCERTIFICATIONS.—  ‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in  subparagraph (B), a certification under subsection (a) shall be given effect unless the  court finds that such certification is not supported by substantial evidence provided to  the court pursuant to this section.  ‘‘(B) COVEREDCIVILACTIONS.—In a covered  civil action relating to assistance alleged to  have been provided in connection with an intelligence  activity  involving  communications that was authorized by the President  during the period beginning on September 11,  2001, and ending on January 17, 2007, a certification under subsection (a) shall be given  effect unless the court—  ‘‘(i) finds that such certification is not supported by substantial evidence provided to  the court pursuant to this section; or  ‘‘(ii) determines that the assistance provided by the applicable electronic communication service provider was provided  in  connection with an intelligence activity that  violated  the Constitution  of  the United  States.  ",2008
991,90,2008-07-08,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I believe that history will look back at the  period of time between 9/11 and the  present as the greatest expansion of  the executive authority in the history  of this country. We have seen the unauthorized military  commissions. We  have seen the extraordinary rendition  to the frequent invocation of state secrets, privilege, and the misuse of so-  called signing statements.  The signing statements represent a  fundamental failure of the Congress to  utilize  its  constitutional  authority.  When the Constitution provides that  there is a presentment by both Houses,  the President either signs it or vetoes  it, and the widespread practice has now  come  into play where the President  signs and issues a signing statement  undercutting key provisions of the legislation. I introduced a bill to give Congress  standing  to challenge  that  in  court. It has gone nowhere because of  the impossibility of overriding a veto  and because of the considerations of  case in controversy.  We have seen, in the context of the  evolving issues, the total ill-effectiveness of Congress to provide the oversight of the Intelligence Committees.  The National Security Act of 1947 expressly provides that matters such as  the  terrorist  surveillance  program  should be submitted to the Intelligence  Committees, but  that has not been  done. Only a portion of the Intelligence  Committees have been briefed. Most of  the  limited briefing was done only  when the administration needed some  support for the confirmation of General  Hayden as CIA Director. We have seen  the provisions of the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 bypassed by the executive branch on a  claim  of  constitutional  authority  under article II, power as Commander  in Chief, contrasted with the congressional authority under article I.  A Detroit Federal court declared the  terrorist surveillance program unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals for  the Sixth Circuit reversed, in a 2-to-1  decision on the ground of the lack of  standing, with the dissenter filing an  opinion showing ample basis for standing. The Supreme Court of the United  States refused to review the case. They  called it a denial of certiorari. That is  the major constitutional confrontation  of our era, between the President asserting article II powers as Commander  in Chief and the explicit statutory provision enacted by Congress in 1978 providing for the exclusive means of having wiretapping.  Instead, we  have  warrantless wiretapping.  The  legislation pending now would  provide retroactive immunity. I suggest retroactive immunity in a context  that we could both preserve the electronic surveillance and leave the court  with jurisdiction in one of two ways.  One, by substituting the Federal Government as the party defendant of the  telephone companies, in the shoes of  the telephone companies with no more,  no less rights; or secondly, requiring,  as my amendment does, that the Federal district court would decide constitutionality.

995,97,2008-07-08,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, like so  many of my colleagues, I spent the  week of the Fourth of July traveling  my State of South Dakota. I met with  members of the general public at an energy forum, met with small businesses,  folks in the tourism industry. Everywhere I went it was the same story:  High gas prices are crippling the American economy.  I remember stopping  in the small  town of Parkston and visiting with  someone who manages a small cafe´  there, and visiting with them about the  impact that high gas prices are having  on their business.  She said: Well, it is not really the  weekend travelers, the RV owners, the  people who camp, but it is those people  who are commuting to work every single day who now do not have  the  money to eat out nearly as often.  Of course, Parkston is a small town.  It is about 20 miles, give or take, from  Mitchell, SD. There are a number of  people who commute back and forth. It  is those commuters who are feeling the  most economic hardship as a result of  high energy prices.  I attended my parents’ 65th wedding  anniversary in my hometown of Murdo.  In my hometown, tourism, the visitor  industry, is the very lifeblood of that  community. I grew up in that business,  worked  in  restaurants, motels,  that  sort of thing. And I even had a forum,  as well, with members of the tourism  industry  in South Dakota  in Rapid  City when I was home just to gauge the  impact of high fuel prices on their individual businesses.  The Rapid City mayor, who owns a  campground, said: I think we are going  to reach a tipping point where the very  foundations  of  the  travel  industry  could be shaken.  Bill Honerkamp,  president  of  the  Black Hills, Badlands and Lakes Association said tourism fell about 7 percent in the region in May, and numbers  for the rest of the summer are barely  holding steady.  Teddy Hustead, president of the popular South Dakota tourist stop Wall  Drug, said tourist stops were down 1  percent in June. But he went on to say  that Wall Drug needs to be up 4 to 5  percent to be a healthy, growing, viable concern, and it is hard to grow a  business when gas is increasing by 10,  20, and 25 percent every single year.  Sean Casey, the vice president of another popular South Dakota  tourist  destination, Bear Country USA, noted  that visitation is down 7 percent for  the year 2008. And he went on to say:  Energy is pinching us. I always joke  that we are going to a model like the  space shuttle—two visitors at $10 million each.  Jo Casky of the Spearfish Convention  and Visitors Bureau noted that convention is dropping because of high gas  prices. One particular convention was  booked with a prediction of 1,200 to  1,400 attendees. That is unlikely now  because of the rising pump prices.  Casky said: We are now at about 800.  As soon as gas started getting to the $4  mark, we started to see reservations  back off.  High gas prices are having a dramatic impact on families, small businesses, the tourism industry, the airline industry, the agricultural industry, and virtually every sector of the  American economy.  I  toured a UPS  facility  in Sioux  Falls, SD. Many of my colleagues may  have heard what they are doing  in  terms of dealing with the price of fuel.  They actually now, as they diagram  routes for their drivers, diagram routes  that only allow them to make right  turns so they do not sit in a left-turn  lane and idle thereby using more energy.  My point is that people are taking  extraordinary steps to deal with the  high cost of energy. Higher costs for  companies such as UPS, transportation  companies, get passed on to consumers  in the form of higher prices for everything they buy. They are looking for  leadership in Washington, DC. But instead of leadership, they have seen a  decade of  inaction, as arguably  the  most important issue of impacting the  American economy has been left unattended.  We have done nothing to affect the  basic law of supply and demand. Some  argue, and perhaps  rightly  so,  that  high energy costs are partly a function  of the weak dollar. They would be, as I  said, accurate to say that because oil is  denominated in dollars. When it takes  $1.57 to purchase a Euro, it is going to  make anything denominated in dollars  more expensive.  There are those who think speculators are driving up the cost of energy  in this country, and  it  is true that  trading in energy commodities has increased dramatically over the past 30  years since the exchanges were created.  I, for one, happen to believe we need to  look for ways to define the degree to  which speculation is impacting energy  prices in this country and also look at  what we can do to address that issue in  a way that makes matters better and  not worse.  Trading since 2004 on the NYMEX Exchange has nearly tripled. So we need  to make sure our farmers, our ranchers, our airlines, our trucking companies, have the opportunity and ability  that they need to manage risk. That is  what those markets were created for.  We  also  need  transparent markets  where all traders are subjected to the  same sets of rules.  I believe we need more cops on the  beat. We need to make sure the CFTC  has the funding it needs to do its job  and to enforce our laws. I think we can  do  some  things,  such  as  codifying  CFTC position limits and transparency  for foreign boards of trade. I guess my  point is that there are a number of  things we can do to address the impact  that speculators may be having on the  price of energy in this country. And,  frankly, I think that is a role and responsibility that Congress should fill.  But if you take the weak dollar, and  you take speculators out of the equation, we still have a major problem and  a major crisis in this country. That  problem is that we have greater demand for energy than we have supply.  We use about 86, 85 to 86 million barrels  of oil every single day worldwide. Of  that amount, the United States uses  about 20 million barrels or about 24  percent of the total. Of that amount of  20 million  barrels  that  the United  States uses every single day, about 12  million barrels are imported.  In other words, 60 percent of the oil  that we use every single day in America  comes  from outside  the United  States. We are transporting and shipping and transferring about a half trillion dollars every single year of American wealth  outside  of  the United  States to petro dictators who are being  enriched by that American wealth and  using it in ways that I think most of us  would disagree with; in fact, in many  ways to support terrorist organizations  in places around the world.  Now, we cannot solve our dangerous  dependance upon foreign sources of energy absent affecting that basic  law  and rule of supply and demand. We  have to find more energy in this country. We should be taking steps now to  add supply and to reduce our demand.  One of the things we need to continue  to support and intensify, in my view, is  our commitment toward renewable energy. I want to read something that  Tom Friedman said in an op-ed on June  29. The op-ed was titled ‘‘Anxious in  America.’’  But he said:  My fellow Americans. We are a country in  debt and in decline, not terminal, not irreversible, but in decline. Our political system  seems incapable of producing long-range answers to big problems or big opportunities.  We are the ones who need a better functioning democracy. More than the Iraqis and  Afghans, we  are  the  ones  in  need  of  nationbuilding as it is our political system  that is not working.

Doctors deserve better than to be involuntarily paired with a poison pill  provision that cannot pass this Congress on its own merits. I repeat, there  is not a single Member of this Senate  who wants these cuts to go into effect.  The issue of Medicare Advantage is  so important because of the competition. If we are ever going to solve the  future of funding on the issue of Medicare as a whole, if we are going to have  that goal that the AMA wants of 18  months to look at a permanent fix to  this issue, if we are going to prevent  the train wreck that looms a few short  years from now on the funding of Medicare as a whole, then we are going to  have to inject competition. But let’s  not use it as a political football. Let’s  not adopt offsets on which there have  been no hearings. Let’s not change  basic Medicare policy in the form of a  pay-for for a temporary fix.  What we are looking at is two vastly  different approaches to health care reform:  the  traditional Medicare, one  size fits all, take it or leave it, that  would lead us to a Canadian-style, single-payer  type  plan  for  the  entire  United States of America, or injecting  this little bit of competition to see if  we can help control the cost of the  Medicare Program. That is what we are  making this stand about, and that is  why I hope eventually we will adopt  the unanimous consent request Senator COCHRANhas made and move to a  bipartisan plan we can all support and  prevent these doctor cuts from going  into effect.

1003,118,2008-07-08,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, I wish to  publicly  commend  and  congratulate  MG Galen B. Jackman, U.S. Army,  upon his retirement after more than 35  years of military service. During the  last 3 years, from July 2005 through  July  2008, Major General  Jackman  served as the Army Chief of Legislative  Liaison. He was instrumental in improving the understanding of Members  of Congress and staff concerning a wide  range of Army issues, in particular an  understanding of the Army’s role  in  the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the  resource requirements for an army at  war, and the effect of those wars on the  Army and its soldiers and their families. Major General Jackman worked  tirelessly to ensure that soldiers and  Army civilians had the resources necessary to maintain the Army as the  world’s preeminent  land  service. He  forged effective relationships with congressional Members and staff, always  responding quickly and effectively to  congressional requests for information  and assistance, and has been an invaluable advisor to the Secretary and Chief  of Staff of the Army.  General  Jackman’s  assignment  as  Army Chief Legislative Liaison was the  capstone to an outstanding career of  service to our Nation. Prior to assuming this position, Major General Jackman served as the Commanding General, U.S. Army Military District of  Washington  and  Commander,  Joint  Force Headquarters-National Capital  Region, Fort Lesley J. McNair, Washington, DC. His other  joint assignments include service as the Deputy for  Training and Readiness, United States  Pacific Command, and Director of Operations, United States Southern Command.  Major General Jackman served as the  Chief of Staff and Assistant Division  Commander,  Support,  for  the  10th  Mountain Division, Light, Fort Drum,  NY, deploying with the Division in support of OPERATION JOINT FORGE,  Bosnia-Herzegovina June 2000 to July  2001.  He began his service to our Nation in  1973 as a rifle platoon leader, Company  A, 1st Battalion, Airborne, 508th Infantry, 82d Airborne Division, Fort Bragg,  NC. His  leadership positions  include  serving as a support squadron commander in 1st Special Forces Group,  Airborne, Fort Bragg, NC; Commander,  2d  Brigade,  7th  Infantry Division,  Light, Fort Ord, CA, and director,  Combined Arms  and Tactics Directorate, U.S. Army Infantry Center and  School, Fort Benning. In his numerous  leadership  and  command  positions  throughout his distinguished  career,  Major General Jackman demonstrated  an unwavering commitment to the welfare of his soldiers and their families.  Throughout his career, he played an  important role in the development of  the future officers and leaders of the  Army.  Major General Jackman holds a master of science degree in procurement  and contract management  from  the  Florida Institute of Technology and a  bachelor of arts degree from the University of Nebraska. He is a graduate of  the Industrial College of the Armed  Forces.  His outstanding Service has been recognized  with  numerous  military  awards  including  the Distinguished  Service Medal, the Defense Superior  Service Medal, with Oak Leaf Cluster;  the Legion of Merit, with Oak Leaf  Cluster; the Defense Meritorious Service Medal; and the Meritorious Service  Medal, with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters.

1006,139,2008-07-08,Mr. SKELTON.," Madam Speaker,  let me  take this means to recognize the brave men  and women of  the Missouri National Guard,  for their commitment to providing flood relief.  The Missouri National Guard Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen have been mobilized by Missouri government leaders to assist in the Missouri emergency  flood response. The members have been mobilized in the communities  of Clarksville, Hannibal, Canton, West Quincy,  LaGrange, Winfield, Alexandria, St. Charles  City, and St. Charles County. Those supporting  the  flood  response are assisting  in  missions that include sandbagging operations,  levee monitoring, and manning traffic control  points. Since the mobilization of forces, more  than 1,000 Guard members have responded  to the call to duty. With force rotations, there  are currently around 700 members on active  duty.  Personnel have come from across the state  to aid Missouri towns during this emergency.  These units  include  the 7th Civil Support  Team from Fort Leonard Wood; the 135th Military History Detachment from Jefferson City;  the 835th Combat Support Sustainment Battalion  from  Jefferson City;  735th Quartermaster Company with detachments in DeSoto,  Jefferson City, Rolla, Cape Girardeau and Jefferson Barracks;  the 1138th Transportation  Company from Jefferson Barracks; the 1035th  Maintenance Company  from Jefferson Barracks; 3175th Chemical Company from St. Peters;  the  1438th Engineer Company  from  Macon  and Kirksville;  the  220th Engineer  Company from Festus; the 880th Haul Team  from Perryville;  the  1137th Military Police  Company  from  Kennett,  Jackson  and  Doniphan; the 1138th Military Police Company  from West Plains and Springfield; the 1175th  Military Police Company from St. Clair and St.  Louis; 1140th Engineer Battalion  from Cape  Girardeau; the 205th Military Police Battalion  from Poplar Bluff; the 203rd Engineer Battalion  from Joplin; the 131st Fighter Wing from St.  Louis; the 1138th Engineer Company (Sapper)  in Farmington; and the 70th Troop Command  from Jefferson Barracks.  I know the Members of the House will join  me in recognizing the outstanding dedication  of the Missouri National Guard, and in wishing  them  luck  throughout  this emergency operation.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL  GUARD  TECHNICIAN  RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION ACT  HON. JOE COURTNEY  OFCONNECTICUT  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 8, 2008  ",2008
1007,139,2008-07-08,Mr. COURTNEY.," Madam Speaker,  I am  proud to introduce legislation today that will restore fairness for our military technicians, who  work every day in Connecticut and across the  Nation to support our National Guard.  If the National Guard serves as the backbone of our military, then our military technicians serve as the backbone of our National  Guard. They play a critical role  in ensuring  that our National Guard is ready to respond  and deploy  in support of military operations  abroad by supporting the training, equipment  repair and restoration, logistics and other critical functions.  Military technicians are known as ‘‘dual-status’’ employees, through which they must retain membership in the Air or Army National  Guard in their State in order to maintain full-  time employment as a technician. Dual-status  military technicians are subject to the restrictions of the Technician Act of 1969, 32 USC  709, and other provisions of  the  law under  which they are specifically prohibited from receiving certain benefits and rights available to  them as members of the National Guard, such  as reenlistment bonuses and student loan repayment assistance. In addition, if a member  of the National Guard becomes a technician  within 6 months of receiving an enlistment or  reenlistment bonus,  the Department of Defense can, and often does, require  them  to  pay back those bonuses.  The law also fails to fairly compensate technicians for the increased overtime hours that  technicians must work to fulfill their mission by  providing technicians compensatory time, rather than monetary compensation, in return for  overtime work. Many technicians cannot use  the compensatory time without impacting time-  sensitive military work schedules and, with the  military’s current ‘‘use it or lose it’’ policy under  which such time is lost if unused within 21 pay  cycles, many technicians face the prospect of  losing the time off they have earned.  Last summer, I had the chance to visit the  1109th  Aviation Classification  and Repair  Depot, AVCRAD, in Groton and see first hand  the work  they were doing  to support of our  National Guard. There, nearly 300 military  technicians provide maintenance and logistics  for aircraft and equipment for 14 States across  the northeast and supports Connecticut’s fleet  of Black Hawk helicopters. During my visit, the  leadership of the unit described how busy the  facility has been over the past several years.  They’ve literally been burning the midnight oil  in trying to keep up with the demand of keeping equipment repaired and ready to deploy.  It’s an  incredible operation, and one  that  is  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:42 Jul 09, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A08JY8.008 E08JYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2008
1008,146,2008-07-08,Mrs. MUSGRAVE.," Madam Speaker,  I rise  today to honor the Koshare Indian Dancers,  who are celebrating 75 years of history and  culture.  The Koshare Indian Dancers offered refuge,  hope, and a spirit of camraderie to boys during Depression-era America. In 1933, a group  of young boys from southeastern Colorado decided to study the heritage of their area. They  formed an archaeology and Indian club where  they could study the history, culture and artifacts of the lower Arkansas Valley. Soon, with  the help of  their young Scout master, J.F.  ‘‘Buck’’ Burshears, they were meeting with elders representing both the Plains Indians and  many different Pueblos across New Mexico  and Arizona. The elders embraced the youthful enthusiasm of these boys, teaching them  dances, songs, and many different aspects of  the ways of their ancestors. Buck dubbed the  new club Koshares, the Hopi word for ‘‘clown’’  or ‘‘fun maker,’’ and the Koshare Indian Dancers have been going strong ever since.  ‘‘The club grew beyond anything we ever  thought it would be,’’ said Dr. William Sisson.  He and his friend Robert Inman held the first  meeting of the Koshare Club. Soon it was an  organization of hundreds of boys, who continued to pass on their knowledge from generation to generation. An important part of what  they passed on was love for, and protection  of, the land, living honestly and with integrity,  and  learning how  to be a  leader who embraces community service. That sense of service grew from a community focus to a nation-  wide focus, as hundreds of Koshares served  in every war in which the United States has  fought since World War II.  ‘‘Doing  those dances was demanding and  required hard work,’’ said one of the original  organizers, Jimmy Taylor. ‘‘The dances were  important to learn, but it was more important  what you  took with you  throughout your  life  from the experience. It gave young boys an  outlet for their energy, gave them a sense of  accomplishment, and it trained their minds to  analyze and complete a project.’’ Mr. Taylor  went on to West Point and served his country  during World War II with honors.  The loss of Koshares during World War II  spurred  their vast collection of art and artifacts. In memory of their fallen comrades, they  originally bought three paintings. By continuing  to gather pieces over the years, the Koshares  amassed one of the most extensive collections  of southwestern art and artifacts in the West.  Service remains a large part of the meaning  of the organization. The Koshares continue to  foster leadership skills and to provide an environment for young people to learn about the  heritage of Southeastern Colorado. They also  persist  in sharing  that heritage with others  through  their museum  and  performances.  Boys, and now girls, benefit from the program,  and the Arkansas Valley is richer because of  the  history  and  culture  provided  by  the  Koshare  Indian Dancers.  It  is my distinct  honor to recognize the Koshares and to wish  them continued success.  f  COMPTROLLER RECOGNIZES  THE  SIGNIFICANCE OF RELATIONSHIP  WITH THE CARIBBEAN DURING  CARICOM CONFERENCE  IN NEW  YORK  HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 8, 2008  ",2008
1009,146,2008-07-08,Mr. RANGEL.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to bring your attention  to remarks made by  New York City Comptroller William C. Thompson,  Jr. during  the CARICOM Conference  luncheon at  the Brooklyn Marriott Hotel on  Thursday the 19th of June.  Bill spoke first and foremost to the uniqueness of the New York Caribbean relationship.  He mentioned,  ‘‘While Caribbean Americans  made up only 5 percent of the United States’’  foreign-born population  in  the 2000 Census,  over one in five foreign-born residents of New  York City came from the Caribbean. He also  recognized the tremendous economic potential  that the New York Caribbean population has;  ‘‘Caribbean Americans are creating jobs and  stimulating  the  economy  with  businesses  across the city . . . [and] helping to insulate  us from the cyclical highs and lows in our finance and real estate sectors.’’  Most  importantly, Mr. Thompson spoke of  the increasingly influential role that emerging  markets are having on  the world economy.  ‘‘Since 2002, emerging markets have outperformed many developed markets’’ and ‘‘It is  estimated that forty-five percent of the aggregate Gross Domestic Product  in  the world  comes  from emerging markets  today.’’ He  made it clear that he will be considering the  Caribbean as, a place to invest funds under  his control as New York City Comptroller.  The CARICOM Conference was crucial  to  address key issues of enterprise in the Caribbean but also  to  recognize  the substantial  economic  influence of Caribbean nations as  well as their enormous potential for growth.  f  TRIBUTE TO CASSIE KEITT WEEKS  HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN  OFSOUTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 8, 2008  ",2008
1010,146,2008-07-08,Mr. CLYBURN.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to a wonderful constituent  on  the occasion of her 100th birthday. Mrs.  Cassie Keitt Weeks of Fort Motte, South Carolina will become a centenarian on August 5,  2008. This is a remarkable milestone that few  of us are ever able to achieve.  Cassie Keitt is the daughter of the late Hattie Young and Elijah ‘‘Bub’’ Keitt of Fort Motte.  She was married to the late Jesse Weeks, Sr.  Mrs. Weeks  can  trace  her  ancestry  to  slaves on the Lang Syne Plantation and the  Goshen Plantations in Fort Motte. Both Mrs.  Weeks and her husband were employed by  the Peterkin family at the Lang Syne Plantation until their retirement.  The church is a central part of Mrs. Weeks’  life. Her great-grandfather  is on  the original  deed as an organizer of Mt. Pleasant Baptist  Church in Fort Motte. It was the first church  organized by former slaves in the community,  and Mrs. Weeks attends  that church  today.  She  is among  the church’s staunchest supporters and serves in a number of capacities.  She  is a Church Mother, a member of  the  Senior Choir and Sunday school class, and  serves as a pastor’s aide. She is an avid fundraiser, a homecoming and friends and family  day captain, and a member of the building and  kitchen committees. She also serves as  the  church historian. When asked about the secret  to her longevity, Mrs. Weeks replies, ‘‘trusting  in the Lord.’’ She also adds, ‘‘I like it on this  side. This is all I know, so I will stay as long  as I can.’’  Among her other pleasures when she was  able were making Lye soap and quilting bees.  The Weeks home was always the gathering  place  for  friends and  family. Today she still  enjoys sitting on  the porch and entertaining  visitors. She  is also a very avid voter, and  never misses the opportunity to cast her ballot.  Mrs. Weeks family provides her tremendous  strength and  joy. She  is  the mother of  four  children: daughters Rebecca Weeks Brown  and Hattie Belle Weeks Scott and sons Jesse  Weeks, Jr. (deceased) and Julius Weeks.  She  is  the grandmother of eight; great  grandmother of eighteen; and the great, great  grandmother of three. In addition she has a  host of nieces, nephews, cousins and many,  many friends.  Madam Speaker, I invite you and my colleagues to join me today in wishing a happy  100th birthday  to Cassie Keitt Weeks. This  strong matriarch remains independent and active, and serves as an example  to us all.  I  wish her health, happiness and Godspeed on  this momentous occasion!

1011,3,2008-07-17,Mr. PITTS.," Today my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle are bringing  up legislation promoting drilling in the  National Petroleum Reserve, a  large  desolate tract of land to the west of  ANWR in Alaska. It is nice that they  finally acknowledge we need to access  more of our own energy resources right  here at home. But I do find it strange  that they are willing to advocate drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve,  which was originally set aside for the  use of our military in an emergency,  yet they continue to oppose oil exploration in ANWR.  The National Reserve contains about  440 barrels of oil per acre, compared to  ANWR’s 5,475 barrels per acre. The National Reserve’s oil and gas fields are  more than 250 miles from existing pipeline  infrastructure,  compared  to  ANWR’s 75-mile distance. The National  Reserve’s oil and gas fields are spread  out over 23 million acres, compared to  1.9 million acres in ANWR.  It is strange that my colleagues, who  are  supposed  to  be more  environmentally conscious, would wish to drill  for oil that is more spread out and will  require a much larger footprint to access  instead of using the more concentrated oil and natural gas resources  in ANWR.  f  DRILL ACT PROMOTES DRILLING  ON 311 MILLION ACRES OF OPEN  LAND  (Mr.  CARNAHAN  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2008
1012,3,2008-07-17,Mr. CARNAHAN.," Mr. Speaker, with  high gas prices crippling the American  economy, this country needs a long-  term energy plan to lower gas prices,  make America more  secure,  create  green jobs, and reduce global warming.  House Democrats support responsible  drilling as part of our comprehensive  strategy,  but many Republicans  in  Washington say we need to do more  drilling in our pristine oceans and wilderness areas, even though 300 million  acres of public land, more than three  times the size of California, are already  open for leasing. They want us to give  more public  land  to Big Oil,  even  though 68 million acres of land are already leased and not being developed.  Today, the House will consider the  DRILL Act. I urge my colleagues to  join us in passing this vital legislation  that will  speed up  development  of  NPRA, require Big Oil to use the land  they have leased or lose it, and ban foreign export of Alaskan oil to ensure  our oil stays in America.  Mr. Speaker, this  is commonsense  legislation  that  does  exactly what  many are asking for, more drilling. So  why don’t they support a bill that requires Big Oil to drill and not  stockpile more leases?  just  f  b1015  A START TO LOWERING GAS  PRICES  (Mr.  BOUSTANY  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2008
1013,3,2008-07-17,Mr. BOUSTANY.," Mr. Speaker, this  week the President took a small but  important step to lowering the price at  the pump for American families. Lifting his ban on Outer Continental Shelf  energy exploration was the right thing  to do, and I applaud him for it. Now,  Congress must act.  We can help increase American supply, lower the price at the pump, and  create good American jobs. The ball’s  in our court. Will Congress listen to  our constituents who are struggling  with tough decisions about where and  when they can drive? Or will congressional leadership remain beholden to  environmental extremists?  In Louisiana, energy production  is  done in a responsible way. After two  devastating hurricanes, employees of  our energy industry worked hard to get  rigs back up and running knowing they  were a very important part of our recovery efforts. OCS does not represent  a magic bullet. However, it’s one piece  of a responsible comprehensive energy  plan to lower the price at the pump. Innovative technology, better conservation, and new fuels are critical, too. So  let’s start all of them. What is holding  us up? By harnessing all of America’s  vast resources and genius, we can give  Americans, in the short term and long  term, a good energy policy.  Let’s do the responsible thing. Let’s  have a comprehensive energy policy.  f  CHOICE AND FREEDOM IN OIL  ADDICTION  (Mr. INSLEE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2008
1014,3,2008-07-17,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, slavery in  this country did not end in the 1860s. It  still exists because we all are still  enslaved by oil.  It  is an addiction.  George Bush himself said we are addicted to oil. But his answer is to increase the addiction, to go back to the  dealer just for one more stick of the  needle. That is not a long-term energy  supply response to this crisis.  Americans need a choice of new energy supplies beyond oil, which is the  only way  to  break  this  addiction,  which is the only way to drive down  price, which is the only way to have an  alternative to oil.  I had  in my office yesterday  the  Interdale Company, building one of the  first  lithium  ion batteries, and  the  A123 Battery Company; they are going  to provide the battery  for the GM–  VOLT. We have  to provide  freedom  from this oil addiction by having a policy that gives Americans choice of new  electric cars, new algae-based biofuels.  That’s a vision for choice and freedom  in this country. That’s what we should  be doing. And we will be  starting  today.  f  CONSEQUENCES OF FOREIGN OIL  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, our Nation’s economic and  national security is being threatened  by our continued reliance on foreign  oil. The pain at the pump is having a  terrible impact on the wallets of American families. Simultaneously, we are  sending billions of dollars overseas to  buy the foreign oil we pay far too much  for here at home.  Exploration of American oil and natural gas right here at home means we  can rely less on unstable regimes and  break the monopoly of foreign oil. The  more American-made energy we use  means less of our money going to line  the pockets of dictators like Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. We have  the  resources and the technology to get these  resources in an environmentally sound  way.  We must face the fact there are real  consequences to congressional inaction  just as there would be substantial benefits to adopting an all-of-the-above  energy policy, which I and many of my  Republican colleagues support.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th.  f  BIG OIL IS NOT DRILLING  (Mr. DEFAZIO asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2008
1015,3,2008-07-17,Mr. DEFAZIO.," Back when George  Bush was elected in 2001, gas was $1.48  a gallon, and we imported 52 percent of  our oil. Today, gas is $4.39 a gallon in  my district, and we’re  importing 58  percent of our oil. In the meantime,  what’s been done?  Well, we adopted the Republican energy plan, formulated in secret by DICK  CHENEY—yet  another  oilman  along  with George Bush—and  some people  say, Well, it’s not working. I think it’s  working. Record profits for the oil industry and their friends, $551 billion  since George Bush took office and more  dependence on imported oil from Saudi  Arabia and other friends of the President.  We need a new energy policy in this  country, and we’re striking out in that  direction. We’ve already passed new  mandates for fuel efficiency. We tried  to move us towards renewables. But we  need some interim supply. That’s why  we have the DRILL Act up today. We  need interim supply, but Big Oil is sitting on leases that can access 80 percent of our estimated reserves in Alaska and the Outer Continental Shelf,  and they’re not drilling it.

1019,10,2008-07-17,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker, we have  heard about this rise in oil prices that  is related to this meeting. And I would  like to yield to the gentleman from  Colorado to tell us about this meeting  that took place and why he can make  the accusation that George Bush and  DICKCHENEYas a result of this private  meeting have raised oil prices. That  meeting took place years ago. I would  like to hear about this.  I would yield to the gentleman.  ",2008
1020,10,2008-07-17,Mr. PERLMUTTER.," I appreciate my  friend from Texas yielding to me. If  people knew what happened in this secret meeting, we might know today  why oil is at $4.35 a gallon, why it has  gone from under $30 a barrel to almost  $150 a barrel. But the Vice President  has refused to provide any information  to the public or to the Congress about  that meeting.  ",2008
1021,10,2008-07-17,Mr. SESSIONS.," Reclaiming my time,  it is obvious that the gentleman made  a  statement  saying gas prices have  risen because of this private meeting.  And now the gentleman has not only  no clue what took place in the meeting, as I don’t either, but now makes  the leap of assumption that 8 years  later that gasoline is going to rise in  price.  The facts of the case are this. The  facts of the case are that this Congress  refuses to provide the energy companies, the oil companies, with what they  need where they say the oil exists. And  this Democrat Congress is refusing to  help consumers. And since this Democrat Congress,  this new Democratic  Congress has taken over, prices have  risen dramatically.  There is not some plan that exists.  There is no secret plan. There is no  plan because the plan that is happening  is what  the Democrat plan  is.  It’s  working  exactly as  the Democratic  Party wanted. Prices are rising significantly. And that is their plan. What I  think would be disingenuous is to say,  oh, my gosh, we wish prices would go  down. That is just disingenuous if you  don’t back it up with facts of the case  of how that could be done.  To go to the emergency petroleum  reserves would be a disaster. And it  would be a disaster because that  is  there  in an extreme national emergency. We’ve heard this morning, we  can think of no reason why that would  not be used. Well, there are people who  can think of reasons. And it’s called if  a group of terrorists wiped out every  tanker that was coming to the United  States and our military did not have  any energy or oil. That could be a good  reason not to go to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, is the new Democrat majority does  not intend to do anything to help the  American consumer to get more oil  supplies and thus reduce the price of  gasoline.

1024,10,2008-07-17,Mr. SESSIONS.," The fact of the matter is that this entire body, on virtually every single piece of legislation,  sees where the energy and oil  issue  comes up because the Republican Party  is trying to get the new Democrat majority to change the rules that are  hamstringing consumers all across this  country.  And what we’re trying to say, whether it be an appropriations bill up in  Rules Committee or here today, is that  the American consumers, the American  people deserve and want this Congress  to act. And all we hear are excuses. We  hear about all this land that is available out there. There sure is. Oil companies don’t want to drill dry holes.  They want to drill where the oil is. And  we are coming here to the floor, virtually every piece of legislation, every  single committee in this House of Representatives is asking for the opportunity to be  for the American consumer as opposed to some special interest group.  And what we’re told is that we need  to change the way we do business and  we need to be more like Europe. Well,  being more like Europe is not an answer  for America. We’re not  just a  country. We’re the greatest nation on  the face of this world. And we need the  ability—and the American people are  asking all over this country for the  new Democrat majority to quit what  they’re doing and allow our free enterprise system and the oil companies to  bring to bear those oil resources that  we have. And arguing all day every day  that they have all that land is not the  right answer.  What is the right answer is we need  to go offshore. And we need to be able  to go to ANWR. The amount of the  acreage is 19 million acres in ANWR.  But all they need is 2,000 acres. They  don’t need the other 181⁄2million. They  need that 2,000. It is one-ninth the size  of DFW Airport, my airport that I land  at every week. That is all we need. We  will not rest our case.  ",2008
1025,10,2008-07-17,Mr. PERLMUTTER.," I yield myself  such time as I might consume.  First, I would just like to say to my  friend  from Texas that with two of  them  in the White House and both  Houses of the Congress in Republican  hands up until 2006 when we started  changing the direction of this nation,  we saw that oil price going up and up  and up and up. And it didn’t change  under them. If we always continue to  drill and don’t look at that as a transitional fuel and move to alternative energies, we’re going to be in trouble.  And we’re going to have to learn this  lesson over and over and over again.  With that, I will yield 4 minutes to  my friend from Wisconsin.  ",2008
1026,10,2008-07-17,Mr. KAGEN.," Mr. Speaker,  today’s  impossible prices for oil have finally  forced America to ask the essential  question: ‘‘Where’s the plan?’’ We’re in  a situation where every business, every  homeowner, every retiree, every local  and  State  government  and  every  United States citizen is being forced to  live under crisis management which is  a recipe for failure.  To become an energy-independent nation, the first step we must take together is to develop a plan, but not behind closed doors, but to do it right  here in the open. So let’s stop pointing  fingers and start holding hands. Let’s  join hands. Let’s begin to think together because we’re really all in this  together.  And let’s agree. Let’s begin by agreeing that a successful energy plan must  begin to  include three essential elements. First, drill  for new oil right  here in America with any such oil obtained from within our territorial waters or national boundaries being sold  to American citizens first. And the Oil  for America Act will do just that. Secondly, we must invest in every form of  renewable energy available and provide  the tax incentives for wind, for solar,  geothermal,  biomass,  cellulosic  and  every form of clean, home-grown energy. We have to provide those incentives  so private  industry will  take  charge and take the lead. And third, we  must act to prevent any price manipulation anywhere in the world in our oil  marketplace.  Now we have already passed legislation. We passed H.R. 6377. This was to  direct the CFTC to do immediate oversight  to  prevent manipulation. We  passed a farm bill that moves us towards  energy  independence,  towards  home-grown ethanol and energy. But  we can’t grow our way out of this problem. We also closed the Enron loophole, guaranteeing that the marketplace will work more effectively.  Drill for new oil in America, invest in  renewable forms of energy and prevent  energy price manipulation. But our  economy  is still dependent on  fossil  fuels today and foreign sources of energy, unfortunately. But oil is still one  of our most precious assets. So let’s  make certain that the more than 140  billion barrels of oil that are underneath America go to Americans first.  Now you have a choice here. We have  to work  together. Under  your  approach, we will have a solution 10 years  from now. Under our approach, we will  have a solution in 10 days, because the  SPR, Strategic Petroleum Reserve, was  opened up several times in the past. In  1991 there was a 33 percent decline in  the price of oil almost immediately. In  2000, it went down nearly 19 percent.  The oil price went down 9 percent in  2005. We can bring about rapid short-  term relief even as we plan for the future. But we cannot solve this problem  by drilling alone. We cannot solve it by  growing corn alone. We have to work  together. We have to drill for new oil,  invest in renewable sources of energy  VerDate Aug 31 2005  23:49 Jul 17, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17JY7.020 H17JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2008

1033,17,2008-07-17,Mr. DEFAZIO.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  There are a lot of reasons we’re in  this pickle we are today. But let’s just  remember one. George Bush elected  2000; DICK secret meetings  with the oil and gas industry. They formulated an energy policy. That energy  policy was adopted by the Republican  House,  the Republican Senate,  and  signed by the Republican President.  That was in 2005. Many of us said it was  shortsighted, it would make us more  dependent upon  imported oil, and  it  has.  When George Bush was elected, 52  percent of our oil was imported. Today  it’s 58 percent. Many of us said it would  drive up the price. It has. When George  Bush was elected, it was $1.46 a gallon.  Today it’s $4.39 a gallon in my district.  So  they’re  saying  now  suddenly,  Whoa. It’s the Democrats’ fault. No.  We’re living under the failures of the  Republican oil industry energy policy.  There’s actually 164,968,695 reasons why  we’re  living under  that. That’s  the  amount of money the Republican Party  has received from the oil industry in  the last 18 years, $164 million in political contributions. Now, that’s a pretty  big motivation.  There’s another thing going on here.  Since George Bush  took office,  the  profits of the oil industry have been  $511 billion in this country. That’s $511  billion out of Americans’ pockets and  into the oil industry’s pockets. They  made more money under 7 years of  George Bush than they made in the entire quarter century preceding his presidency. Yeah. There’s something a little bit rotten here.  They talk about drilling offshore and  all of that stuff. Well, let’s talk about  short-term relief.  There’s three ways to get short-term  relief. One is release our oil. Release  our oil. We have paid to put oil in the  Strategic  Reserve  for  emergencies.  This is an emergency. It’s been done  three times: 1991, the price went down  33 percent; 2000, it went down 18 percent; 2005, it went down 9 percent.  b1230  That would give relief today at the  pump, and there’s another thing that  we could do, but they’re against this,  too.  The gentleman  from Texas  talked  about, oh, they want to file a complaint against OPEC. Well, you know,  we probably do, but George Bush isn’t  going to do that, that’s for sure. Here’s  George Bush holding hands with King  Faisal of Saudi Arabia when he was  over there begging them to increase  production.  OPEC’s production, with a doubling  in the price of oil, is down 21⁄2percent.  They have colluded to drive up the  price of oil and limit the supply, and  we have a  legal option, which  the  President refuses to use. He refuses to  file a complaint in the World Trade Organization for a clear violation of the  rules of  the General Agreement on  Trade and Tariffs, article 11, by the  OPEC countries.  ",2008

1036,17,2008-07-17,Mr. DEFAZIO.," That would have an  immediate  impact  for the American  people. And then there’s the speculators.  Today, the largest holder of oil resources in the United States of America is not ExxonMobil, not Shell, not  Conoco, name all of our oil companies.  No,  it’s Morgan  Stanley  on Wall  Street, through their speculative activity,  followed by Goldman Sachs and  followed by others who are speculating  and driving up the price of this market.  We have  credible  testimony  from  Wall Street experts, if we reined in the  speculation which was created by the  Enron  loophole—remember  Enron?  Texas corporation, Ken Boy Lay, the  President’s  best  friend. He’s  dead.  Enron’s bankrupt. He would have gone  to jail for fraud. But the loophole lives  on, and we’re all paying at the pump.  An estimated 50 percent, according to  Wall Street experts, is going into speculative activities, but they don’t want  to take on speculative activities. They  just want to talk about one thing, and  that is, they want to drill in ANWR.  Well, guess what, ANWR was made a  national wildlife refuge  in 1950. The  Naval Petroleum Reserve was made a  petroleum reserve by Warren Harding.  Now, why was this a natural preserve  and this an oil preserve? Because they  know there’s more than 10 billion barrels of oil under here. Republicans  change it from a naval reserve to a national reserve, and Bill Clinton actually leased it. And yesterday, George  Bush announced he’s going to  lease  more of it.  There’s 10 billion barrels of oil under  this. That’s our Saudi Arabia. They’ve  drilled 25 wells, but they haven’t tried  to  connect  to  the Alaska pipeline.  They’ve capped the wells and they’re  sitting on them. And why are they sitting on them? Because they think if  they keep manipulating  the market  they can make as much money as possible today and even more down the  road. They are sitting on supplies of  oil, and they are  failing to develop  what they could.  ",2008

1039,17,2008-07-17,Mr. YARMUTH.,"  I  thank  the gentleman from Vermont for yielding.  And, you know, we have a wonderful  situation in here. We have a very interesting and productive dialogue, I believe, about something we all want to  do, and that’s to solve our energy crisis  to take the pressure off the American  consumers whose lives are being terribly affected, adversely affected, by  these high gas prices and the economy  as well.  I call back to the words of a very  smart person who once said the significant problems that we have today cannot be solved by the same  level of  thinking that created them. And unfortunately, this idea that we are going to  drill our way out of the problem, both  the short term and the long term, is  the same level of thinking that got us  into this problem. The man who said  that was Albert Einstein. He was a  pretty smart guy.  What we are proposing, and you have  heard many instances of it and suggestions of it today, is that we have the  ability, we have the resources right  now to have an impact, a downward  impact on prices. All we have to do is  free our own oil, free America’s oil. It’s  in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  As my colleague  from Oregon  just  pointed out, we have been able to reduce the price three separate times  over the last 17 years by releasing that  oil. We can do it again and we should  do it again. But more importantly than  that is the entire attitude we take toward what’s down the road, no pun intend.  My colleague from Tennessee on the  other side of the aisle just mentioned a  few minutes ago, he asked where are  the electric cars, where are these hybrid cars? Well, actually, they’re very  close on the horizon. We met with Ford  executives just a few weeks ago in my  hometown  of Louisville, Kentucky.  They are on the verge of some significant breakthroughs. They have a plug-  in hybrid that uses hydrogen power, as  well as electricity. They’re working on  a  battery  car. They  have  several  versions of alternative power sources  they’re working on.  General Motors has promised to have  a battery-powered car on the road in  2010. We know in California there’s a  new manufacturer that’s developed a  battery-powered car.  These are the technologies that will  be our future. We need to be investing  in them, because as President Bush  said the other day, what we are trying  to do with this long-term approach is  change the psychology of the market,  change the psychology of the speculators, so that if they see down the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:39 Jul 18, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17JY7.034 H17JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2008
1040,24,2008-07-17,Mr. RAHALL.," I am shocked that the  gentleman would even start down the  road of campaign contributions in this  debate, but I am not going to proceed  any further down that road.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO).  ",2008
1041,24,2008-07-17,Mr. DEFAZIO.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  In 1923, President Harding took the  Saudi Arabia of the United States and  put it into the Naval Petroleum Reserve. There is a huge pool of known  oil, over 10 billion barrels underneath  what has now been called, and the Republicans changed it from the Naval  Petroleum Reserve to the National Petroleum Reserve. And  yes,  indeed,  President Clinton  did  let  the  first  leases in that more than a decade ago.  The companies have drilled 25 test  wells to find out there is indeed oil  under there, but they have not connected over here to the Prudhoe Bay  pipeline and there is no construction  going on and no active drilling going  on.  Now this area that they want to  argue about, in 1950 it was made into a  wildlife reserve. Now this was made  into a Naval Petroleum Reserve because it has huge amounts of known  oil. This was made into a wildlife reserve because it has huge amounts of  known  wildlife.  President  Harding  didn’t make ANWR into the Naval Petroleum Reserve because no one knows  if there is any oil under there. They try  to pretend that they know that there is  oil there, but the Bush administration’s own Mineral Management Service says there is a 50 percent chance of  recoverable oil under ANWR.  So why not drill here in NPR–A? Why  don’t the Republicans and the oil companies want to fully exploit these 10  billion barrels of oil? I think there is a  pretty simple answer to that, because  they are doing really well under the  Bush-Cheney energy policy. Remember, written in secret, voted on and put  into law by the Republican Congress,  signed by George Bush. During George  Bush’s tenure, the profits of the oil  companies have been $511 billion, a new  record every year George Bush has  been in office, more money in 7 years  than in the preceding quarter-century.  This system is working quite well for  them. They don’t want to increase supply. In fact, they are working hand-in-  glove with OPEC and others who are  colluding to restrict supply.  Drill responsibly in leased land. Exploit America’s resources.  ",2008

1043,24,2008-07-17,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in opposition to H.R. 6515. The  bill was introduced yesterday. It is on  the  floor today. That  is pretty  fast  work. No hearings, no committee process. It is primarily a restatement of existing Federal law with a couple of exceptions. It does have a prohibition of  any oil that is found in Alaska going  anywhere but the lower 48. Chairman  RAHALLand I had a little debate about  that on the House  floor earlier this  week. I certainly don’t have any opposition. It is somewhat meaningless because oil is fungible and it can go wherever it needs to go; but if that is the  price we have to pay to get more oil  drilled and produced in Alaska, I am  actually for that section of the bill.  Having said that, this bill is counterproductive if we really want to find  new oil and gas because it doesn’t open  up any new areas.  b1345  If you only allow drilling where we  have already been allowed to drill, for  example, in the great State of Texas  that I represent, we have drilled over 2  million oil wells since 1901. The probability of finding a major new oil field  in Texas today is much closer to zero  than it is to 100 percent, because we  have already drilled so many wells.  Eighty-five percent of the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States of  America  is off-limits. This bill does  nothing about that. It says, let’s expedite leasing in the Alaska Naval Petroleum Reserve. Fine, but we can already  drill for oil in the Alaska Naval Petroleum Reserve.  What about ANWR? ANPR is to the  west of Prudhoe Bay. ANWR is to the  east. We think there are 10 billion barrels of oil  in a 2,000-acre section of  ANWR, 10 billion barrels. Drill 10 wells,  and you get 1 billion barrels a well.  If we drill on an expedited basis in  ANPR, certainly  there  is oil  to be  found there, but we can already drill  there, and it won’t get 1 billion barrels  per well.  I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this legislation.  ",2008
1044,24,2008-07-17,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes  to  the  distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. HALL) who  has been very active on this issue and  very involved in our debate we had the  other night.  Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker,  I assure you that this Member is serious and sincere, and I strongly support  the DRILL bill.  Gas in my district in the Hudson Valley is over $4.30, and families are paying and really being hurt by this. They  need serious solutions that deliver real  results, and that’s why I support the  Drill Responsibly in Leased Lands Act  to take action right now to extract  more American oil in the right places.  Oil  company advocates have been  preying on the anxiety of Americans to  push the  failed ANWR drilling plan  that would only lower prices by a nickel in 20 years, 20 years in the future.  Our drivers need more help than that,  and they need it faster. The DRILL Act  answers the call, telling oil companies  to drill for oil that can give more relief  than ANWR ever could.  The ‘‘use it or lose it’’ measure requires oil companies to drill on land  they have already leased or make way  for someone who will. If they did that,  they could double production and cut  imports by one-third. It also makes it  easier to lease the 20 million acres of  the National Petroleum Reserve  in  Alaska, already approved for drilling,  and calls on the President to build  pipelines to bring that 10.6 billion barrels of oil to market. The bill will pave  the way to get at the most oil in the  shortest time with the greatest responsibility.  I hope all of my colleagues will support it.

1047,31,2008-07-17,Mr. EMANUEL.," Thank  much for the time.  Three years ago this summer, President Bush signed into law in 2005, in  August—July 28, we passed it here in  the House—an energy bill which the  President said at that time, ‘‘I’m confident that one day the Americans will  look back on this bill as a vital step towards a more secure and prosperous  Nation that is less dependent on foreign sources of energy.’’  At that time, gas was $2.29 a gallon.  By any measurement, that legislation  has failed. Today, it’s $4.11 a gallon,  and our dependence on foreign oil is  greater now than it was then.  What has happened here is we have  provided the oil and gas companies $15  billion in subsidies of taxpayer money  to drill. They’re not drilling on the 68  million acres. We have provided them  68 million acres on the Lower 48 to  drill. They are not drilling.  So we have a simple thing: use-it-or-  lose-it. Get drilling. We agree that supply is part of it. We also agree that efficiency is part of it.  ",2008

Here, we’re moving on supply.  We’re asking you to join us to make  sure that we have adequate supplies  out there. There are 68 million acres to  be drilled, and as the majority leader  said earlier, it’s ironic on the day that  we have the bill on the floor, finally  we’re going to have 2 million acres  opened up in Alaska.  This requires that there’s an annual  offering of more property up to be drilling. It does not have to only occur  when the Congress puts a bill on the  floor  to  threaten an administration  that you finally move more supply to  market.  This is a comprehensive approach to  solving the energy crisis that the country faces.  ",2008

1057,31,2008-07-17,Mr.  RAHALL.,"  Because part of what we must do in  order to bring down the price of energy  to the American people is to increase  domestic  supply and  to protect  the  consumer. And  increasing  domestic  supply means that we must remove all  doubt in the minds of those who wish  to drill and those who want the drilling  to take place that there are 68 million  acres in the lower 48 States where drilling is allowed:  ‘‘Drill Responsibly in  Leased Lands,’’ the DRILL bill.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman,  for the  documentation of that amount of land.  Thirty-three million of those acres are  offshore. So the question is, why do  you not want us to drill offshore? We  do, in 33 million acres. Why do you not  want us to drill on land? We do, in tens  of millions more acres in the lower 48.  And then this bill takes us to Alaska,  where the National Petroleum Reserve-  Alaska is a bigger source of oil than  the ANWR, the refuge in Alaska. So  why those who wish to make an argument here are saying we won’t let you  drill: No, we want you to drill. Why are  you saying this is the law, they have to  do  it anyway?

1059,38,2008-07-17,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman  from Indiana  (Mr. PENCE)  is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2008
1060,38,2008-07-17,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker, the Constitution of the United States provides  that  Congress  shall make  no  law  abridging the freedom of speech or of  the press. These two rights form the  bedrock of our democracy by ensuring  the  free  flow of  information to the  American people.  Sadly,  today,  the  free  and  independent press in America is under fire.  In recent years, more than 40 journalists have been subpoenaed, questioned  or held in contempt for failure to reveal their confidential sources.  For a journalist, maintaining an assurance of confidentiality to a source  is sometimes the only way to bring forward news of great consequence to the  Nation. Being forced to reveal a source  chills reporting of the news, and, thereby, restricts the free flow of information to the public.  Now, not long ago, a reporter’s assurance of  confidentiality was unquestioned. That assurance led to sources  that willingly provided information to  journalists who brought forward news  of enormous consequence to the Nation. One thinks of Watergate, recent  stories of misfeasance at Walter Reed  Army medical center, and even the  abuse of steroids in major league baseball.  All of these stories never would have  come to the light, stories great and  small, were  it not  for  confidential  sources and the dogged persistence of a  free and independent press. As a conservative who believes in a limited government, I believe the only check on  government power in real time is a free  and independent press.  BOUCHER A free press ensures the flow of information to the public, and in this time  of scandals and rumors of scandals and  corruption in high places, such information is needed now more than ever  to hold those in power to account. In  order to maintain our free and independent press,  I authored  the Free  Flow of  Information Act with Congressman RICK of Virginia  several years ago. This bill  is also  known as a Federal media shield statute. It provides a qualified privilege of  confidentiality  to  journalists, which  enables them to shield sources  from  disclosure in certain situations.  Now, the bill is not about protecting  reporters,  it’s  about  protecting  the  public’s right to know. We introduced  the bill in May of 2007, and on October  16 of last year, it passed in this House  of Representatives by an overwhelming  and bipartisan margin of 398–21. I was  especially pleased to earn the support  of Republican and Democratic leadership, the chairman and ranking members of  the  Intelligence and Armed  Services Committee, and many other  leaders throughout the House of Representatives.  The bill received wide bipartisan support because of measures we added to  specifically address very real and legitimate concerns about how a privilege for journalists could impact national security. The Federal Government, as we know, is tasked with a tremendous  responsibility of protecting  the Nation. We must always put national security in the forefront of our  consideration.  The Free Flow of Information Act  does just that. Well, with news that the  United States Senate may be taking up  a version of this legislation as soon as  next week, I wanted to rise to speak  about the bill and what some of its  critics may say.  Critics of the bill will point always to  concerns about national security. But  our version of the bill only provides a  qualified privilege, meaning that disclosure of a source’s identity may be  required  in  certain  situations. The  foremost of those situations, of course,  is when the Nation’s security is placed  at risk. The bill permits compelled disclosure to prevent or identify the perpetrator of an act of terrorism against  the United States or its allies, to prevent significant or specified harm to  national security, or, in cases that involved the unauthorized disclosure of  classified information that caused or  will cause  significant or articulable  harm  to national  security.  In  such  cases, a judge will be able to determine  whether the public interest, in compelling disclosure of a source, outweighs  the public interest in gathering or disseminating news or information.  Overall, I sincerely believe the bill  strikes a reasonable balance between  the public’s right to know and the fair  administration of justice. In striking  that balance, the version of the legislation that passed this House puts national security first.  Long ago Thomas Jefferson warned,  ‘‘Our liberty cannot be guarded but by  the freedom of the press, nor that limited without danger of losing it.’’ Jefferson’s words hold true today.  The passage of the Free Flow of Information Act in this Congress is necessary not only to explicitly and fully  provide for the freedom and press of  our Nation, but also to protect our liberty for future generations of Americans. With  the extraordinary bipartisan support of my colleagues in the  House of Representatives, and support  in the United States Senate, which includes both major party candidates for  President of the United States, it is my  hope that the United States Senate  will take up the Free Flow of Information Act and report it next week with  a strong bipartisan affirmation.  f  ",2008

1063,38,2008-07-17,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  here we are, Thursday afternoon, 3:58  p.m. All across the Nation, the day  shift is ending, or about to end. Folks  getting ready for the afternoon shift.  Other folks that work the night shift  are either just waking up or just going  to sleep to get prepared for another  day, another day of work.  Where is the House? The House has  gone home, Thursday afternoon, and  the House has gone home, not to return  until next Tuesday. What didn’t we do  this week, like we didn’t do last week,  and the week before, and the week before, we didn’t address the number one  issue on the minds of Americans and  hurting the American pocketbook, and  that’s the issue of gas prices, didn’t address it, nothing.  b1600  Now, the majority will tell you that  they brought to the floor a drill bill.  What they brought to the floor today,  Mr. Speaker, cynically, was what they  called a drill bill. In fact, it was really  just a ‘‘no energy’’ energy bill.  Why do I say that? Well, the bill had  eight sections. Six sections are either  current  law or are clerical. Current  law: No new energy. One of the sections  mandated  project  labor  agreements  that would increase the construction  costs of Alaskan pipelines by as much  as 30 percent. Increasing costs: No new  energy. The  final  section would  increase the bureaucracy and the red  tape for any new energy production. It  didn’t open any exploration onshore.

1161,59,2008-07-17,Mr. CASEY.," Mr. President,  you very much.  We have before the Senate  in the  next couple of days a number of important pieces of legislation, but one of  the debates going on right now in the  Senate and beyond across the country  is the response by the Senate and by  the administration on housing. In particular, we have a raging debate about  what to do about the two so-called  mortgage giants, Freddie and Fannie,  as we know them by their acronyms.  There is no question that these two  entities play a substantial role in what  has been happening  to our housing  market. By one estimate, they hold  half of the value of all the mortgages  in the United States of America—trillions and trillions of dollars—by one  estimate as much as $5 trillion. We  have to apply a lot of scrutiny and exercise the kind of due diligence as it  pertains to the administration’s proposal to shore up Fannie and Freddie.  It  is vitally  important. However,  I  think the Congress has to be able to do  two or three things at once.  We have to be able, as we are applying the kind of due diligence and the  kind of review the taxpayers expect us  to provide—and we  should do  that.  There is a long way to go. We can’t just  sign off and say the Treasury Department and the administration or any  other  entity  can do whatever  they  want and we will just rubberstamp it.  We have to make sure the taxpayers’  interests are protected, but while we  are doing that, we have to get housing  legislation passed.  As the Presiding Officer knows, not  just because of the families in Ohio and  Pennsylvania and across the country  who are suffering from the root of our  economic trouble, which is one word,  ‘‘housing,’’ or the problems with housing—as he knows, this legislation has  been held up. There are some in Washington who are using this debate about  scrutiny of the Fannie and Freddie proposal, scrutiny about taxpayer interests, which are  legitimate and real,  using that debate as a way to slow  down the bipartisan housing  legislation. I think we have to make sure we  commit ourselves to a path over the  next couple of days and do it with a  sense of urgency about what is happening in America today because no  matter what we do on due diligence  with regard to the mortgage companies, if we don’t provide relief to families across America on the question of  housing, we will not be doing our jobs.  I think the people across this country, just as they hope we do on gas  prices—they certainly believe that on  the price of gas, or any other prices rising for them, especially on the question of housing—expect us to get something done. So far, there are people in  this body who want to slow things  down. So I think we can provide the  kind of oversight and due diligence for  this proposal with the mortgage giants.  We can provide that oversight but at  the same time move forward with housing legislation.  The fact is, for a lot of Americans,  this is not some remote, theoretical  question. Every day in America—every  weekday, because the courthouses are  not open on the weekends—every weekday, by the latest estimates, 8,400 to  8,500  enter  the  nightmare  of  foreclosure. We can debate a lot of theoretical issues, but unless we focus on  that central  reality  for  families  in  America, we are going to miss the  boat. So all of those  families every  day—8,500 families every day—are entering the nightmare of foreclosure.  I know the Presiding Officer, Senator  BROWN, Senator SCHUMER, and I, the  three of us, a long time ago, way back  in the spring of 2007—more than a year  ago—put on the table the Borrowers  Protection Act, which was a way to  deal with this problem early, to say to  mortgage  originators  and mortgage  brokers: You are not being regulated.  You are causing a good bit of this problem, if not most of the problem. We are  going to regulate your conduct so that  if you have a mortgage transaction and  you are a broker and you are part of  that and there is a homeowner, a family sitting in front of you, we are going  to make sure you escrow for taxes and  insurance, for example. It is not a radical idea, but they were not doing it.  We are going to provide more scrutiny  of the kind of activity that you have as  a mortgage broker. We are going to  make sure if a mortgage broker wants  to make money and wants to bring  families into a transaction that they  have more disclosure; that they tell  that family sitting in front of them  more information about the mortgage  documents, about  the  interest  rate,  and what this family is signing up for.  That legislation has been in front of  the Senate for far too long now. That  kind of bipartisan approach to this crisis is what we need more of.  I have worked with Senator MARTINEZon the other side of the aisle on  appraiser  independence. We have too  many  appraisers  in  these  high-end  mortgages  that were  in  some cases  committing fraud and in other cases  not providing enough information. We  have to make sure when someone does  an  appraisal,  they  are  truly  independent.  What our legislation called for was  having two appraisals to force appraisers to be more independent. Senator  SPECTERand I have worked together in  Pennsylvania to promote a great idea  in the city of Philadelphia. Sometimes  all the great  ideas aren’t  in Washington, as we well know.  A  judge  in  Philadelphia,  Judge  Darnell Jones, a distinguished  jurist  came up on his own, working with people in the city, and then supported by  Mayor Nutter  of Philadelphia with  funding, with a program that says: We  may not be able to legally force people  in  the marketplace  to  do  certain  things, if you have a contract between  a lender and a borrower, but we can at  least  say  that before a  foreclosure  moves forward, you have to have some  mediation,  some  discussion,  some  meeting between the  lender and the  borrower. The  borrower  has  to  do  something. They can’t just hope for the  best. They have to be able to commit  themselves to paying back the mortgage, and the  lender has to give as  well.  These kinds of ideas in the city of  Philadelphia and across the country  should inform what we do here. So Senator SPECTERand I have worked to promote foreclosure mitigation. The Presiding Officer knows foreclosure counseling is not just a good thing to do; it  is not just a couple of hundred million  dollars that we have been able to put  into legislation and become part of our  law—and we need more money—but the  Presiding Officer knows how important  that money is to get dollars into the  hands of people and entities across the  country, most of them nonprofit organizations that understand not just how  to work with the borrower, to work  with the family when they are signing  those  complicated  documents  that  mean they have to enter into an agreement where they have to pay money  back over a long period of time. It is  very complicated. Even if you are sophisticated  in  finance matters,  it  is  pretty complicated.  This  foreclosure counseling money  will give dollars to entities across the  country to work with families, gain the  families’ trust, and then work with the  borrowers when they are entering into  transactions. We have to do more with  foreclosure counseling.  So I think on a whole series of fronts,  there is bipartisan work being done in  the Senate. There are good ideas on the  table  from  communities  across  the  country  and  from  people  in Washington. We have to continue to work  together  in  a  bipartisan way. The  worst thing we could do is stop the  train from moving down the track on  getting housing legislation passed because we are having a debate about  how much scrutiny or oversight or review there  is to a Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac proposal, the kind of review we should apply to do it. We can  do both at the same time.  Once  in a while the Congress can  walk and chew gum at the same time.  This is one of those instances where,  with the families out there who are  suffering under the weight of this housing problem,  this  subprime problem  that has been hanging over the country  and  affecting  international markets  and  international  transactions  right  now, it is one of those instances where  we have to do everything we can to  push this forward.  If you are standing in the way of getting housing legislation passed and you  are using the figleaf or the argument  that somehow we have to apply more  scrutiny to Fannie and Freddie, I don’t  think you are being straight with the  American people. We can do both at  the same time. We can serve the interests of taxpayers on this proposal and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:19 Oct 23, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD08\S17JY8.REC S17JY8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008

1163,66,2008-07-17,Mr. STEVENS.," The letter says:  Twenty years ago, 21 percent of oil contracts were purchased by speculators who  trade oil on paper with no intention of ever  taking delivery. Today, oil speculators purchase 66 percent of all oil future contracts,  and that reflects just the transactions that  are known. Speculators buy up a  large  amount of oil and then sell it to each other  again and again. A barrel of oil may trade 20-  plus times before it is delivered and used; the  price goes up with each trade and consumers  pick up the final tab. Some market experts  estimate that the current prices reflect as  much as $30 to $60 per barrel in unnecessary  speculative costs.  If those pieces of paper that represent future delivery of oil are purchased by people who are just speculating and  that purchaser  ends up,  after selling the paper, acquiring  it  again, to me, that is absolute proof of  a criminal conspiracy in this country.  I think this speculation has to stop.  We have to start talking more about it,  and we have to do something about it.  What I would do is make sure it is a  criminal matter  if someone acquires  the same piece of paper dealing with  futures in oil and has no ability to use  the oil. I really do not think there is  any reason—I can understand a company might buy ahead for 2 or 3 years  in  oil  and  buy  futures  and hedge  against  the price,  that,  in  fact,  it  might go up, but people who buy those  pieces of paper solely to manipulate  the price—and that  is what happens  when someone not involved, these institutional investors, buys a piece of  paper to buy oil in the future and then  sells it to another institutional investor and then another one. If that piece  of paper ends up in the same hands the  second time, to me, that is a criminal  conspiracy, and it is time we looked at  that and understood it. This letter sets  it forth.  Believe me, any Member of the Senate who ignores this letter ignores the  fact that every single  frequent  flier  person in the country has it in their  hands. I don’t know about the rest of  you, but I am getting thousands of letters from people who are sending me  this letter and saying: What are you  going to do about it? I say what we  have to do about it is send a signal to  these speculators to take notice that  Congress is serious about speculators.  I know there is a difference of opinion out here on the floor of the Senate,  there is no question about it, but in the  last 5 years, investments in commodity  index funds jumped from $13 billion to  $260 billion. That means institutional  investors have gone from owning $13  billion worth of oil futures to $260 billion in oil futures.  Now, someone tell me that is not a  conspiracy.  Let me put up this chart. This chart  represents the so-called NYMEX oil futures. The red on the chart represents  the price of oil; the gold represents the  volume of trading. The volume of trading has gone up, but the price has gone  up more than twice as much as the volume.  There  is only one thing that can  drive up a spike like that. That is speculation,  it  is not demand. Someone  told me not to try to understand supply and demand in the oil business. I  think I know something about oil demand in the oil business, because we  tried to meet that demand in terms of  our State. We had a better chance of  satisfying the demand of the United  States than any State. But to have this  situation go along I think is wrong, to  go forward I think is wrong.  I have personally talked to one of the  economists. I must say he does not  share my  feelings that we ought to  make this a crime  immediately, because, it is my understanding, he does  not believe we have seen evidence of  criminal conduct yet.  But I say it is criminal conduct if  someone owns one of those pieces of  paper twice. There is no reason to sell  a future in oil and then turn around  and buy it later at a higher price. They  are actually being acquired and turned  over more than 20 times before the oil  is delivered. That ought to be something the Justice Department and the  CFTC should have notified us on before  it took the time of all of these presidents of these companies to send this  letter to their customers so they can  send it on to us. These people have told  their customers to contact us. Well,  this is one time I hope all of us listen  to what they are saying. Because there  is no question that we have to find  some way to restrict this trading to  those who need oil in the future, those  who legitimately hedge to try and save  their customers money, not to cost  them more money but to save money.  A true hedge would save money for the  customers of the particular person who  acquired the futures.  I think the legislation Senator FEINSTEINand I introduced some time ago  represents an  important step toward  breaking this bubble. The position limits we would place on institutional investors would be very minimal and  would make them stay away from market manipulation.  If we can see these investments shift  away from the energy commodities and  back to the stock markets the way we  have in the last few days, I think the  stock market would recover.  I thank my friend from New Hampshire  for  letting me use part of his  time. But I say, we cannot stop at  mandating transparency. We have to  do something to put these people in  fear before they will stop this action of  driving this price up.  EXHIBIT1  An Open letter to All Airline Customers:  Our country is facing a possible sharp economic downturn because of skyrocketing oil  and fuel prices, but by pulling together, we  can all do something to help now.  For airlines, ultra-expensive  fuel means  thousands of lost jobs and severe reductions  in air service to both large and small communities. To the broader economy, oil prices  mean slower activity and widespread economic pain. This pain can be alleviated, and  that is why we are taking the extraordinary  step of writing this joint letter to our customers. Since high oil prices are partly a response to normal market forces, the nation  needs to focus on increased energy supplies  and conservation. However, there is another  side to this story because normal market  forces are being dangerously amplified by  poorly regulated market speculation.  Twenty years ago, 21 percent of oil contracts were purchased by speculators who  trade oil on paper with no intention of ever  taking delivery. Today, oil speculators purchase 66 percent of all oil futures contracts,  and that reflects just the transactions that  are  known.  Speculators  buy  up  large  amounts of oil and then sell it to each other  again and again. A barrel of oil may trade 20-  plus times before it is delivered and used; the  price goes up with each trade and consumers  pick up the final tab. Some market experts  estimate that current prices reflect as much  as $30 to $60 per barrel in unnecessary speculative costs.  Over seventy years ago, Congress established  regulations  to  control  excessive,  largely unchecked market speculation and  manipulation. However, over the past two  decades, these regulatory limits have been  weakened or removed. We believe that restoring and enforcing these  limits, along  with several other modest measures, will  provide more disclosure, transparency and  sound market oversight. Together, these reforms will help cool the over-heated oil market and permit the economy to prosper.  The nation needs to pull together to reform the oil markets and solve this growing  problem.

1164,73,2008-07-17,Mr.  SPECTER.," Mr.  President,  I  thank the Senator from Alabama for  the question. There was a Republican  forum on Monday of this week to examine the Thurmond Rule. I had notified Chairman LEAHY of  it and had  written to him about  it, and I ask  unanimous consent to have that letter  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  U.S. SENATE,  COMMITTEEONTHEJUDICIARY,  Washington, DC, July 8, 2008.  Hon. PATRICKJ. LEAHY,  Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,  Washington, DC.  DEARPAT: Following up on our telephone  conversation  late yesterday afternoon  in  which I advised that I would raise no technical objection to the Thursday hearing, I  am  amplifying my  comments  about  the  forum which the Senate Republican Conference has scheduled for next Monday, July  14th, at 2:00 P.M. in SR–385.  That Republican forum, one in a series,  will deal with the issue of the so-called Thurmond Rule. As I mentioned to you on the  phone yesterday, it seems to me that is one  which could benefit from participation by  Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee if there is any interest on your part  in doing so.  Obviously, there is a fuller development of  any issue when there are pros and cons; and,  not unexpectedly, the Republican view  is  there is no rule, Thurmond or otherwise, to  preclude confirmation of judges this year.  Distinguished experts have been invited as  follows: Professor John McGinnis, Northwestern Law School; Mr. Roscoe Howard,  former U.S. Attorney, District of Columbia;  David Bohm, Assistant Executive Director of  the North Carolina Bar Association; Mr.  Steve Rutkus, Congressional Research Service.  If there is any interest on your side of the  aisle or if you would like to add an additional witness  (witnesses), we would  be  pleased to try to accommodate.  My best.  Sincerely,  ARLENSPECTER.  ",2008
1165,73,2008-07-17,Mr. SPECTER.," During the course of  that forum, to answer the question directly from the Senator from Alabama,  we had an expert from the Congressional  Research  Service—the  nonpartisan body—come  in to trace the  origins of the so-called Thurmond rule.  He stated that it arose back in the Republican Convention in 1980, when SenRECORD ator Thurmond raised the possibility of  holding up confirmations until after  the election, but it was never done.  The facts are that there were 10 district court  judges confirmed  in September of 1980, and now-Justice Breyer  was nominated to the First Circuit by  President Carter after the election, on  November 13, and was confirmed in December 1980. Another circuit judge was  confirmed after September of 1980.  I put in the RECORDearlier a litany  of district and circuit judges confirmed  after September in the last year of a  Presidential term. I also put into the  statements which had been  made by Senator REID and Senator  LEAHY that there was no practice, no  rule of not confirming judges at the  last part of a President’s term, say  after Labor Day.

1167,73,2008-07-17,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I wonder if  my colleague would yield for a question.  I would like to ask our distinguished  ranking member of  the  committee,  aren’t there several well-qualified judicial nominees currently pending in the  Judiciary Committee who have been  denied fair up-and-down votes? For example, Mr. Peter Keisler, the former  Acting Attorney General, has  been  rated unanimously ‘‘well qualified’’ by  the American Bar Association and has  earned bipartisan praise  from attorneys, professors, and  even  editorial  pages. I know the Washington Post and  the L.A. Times have praised his nomination, calling him a ‘‘moderate conservative’’  and  a  ‘‘highly  qualified  nominee’’ who  ‘‘certainly warrants  confirmation.’’ Notwithstanding those  outstanding qualifications, tomorrow, I  believe, will mark 750 days that Mr.  Keisler has been waiting for a committee vote.  ",2008
1168,73,2008-07-17,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President,  responding to the question, the Senator  from Arizona is correct. Peter Keisler  has been praised in all quarters for his  capabilities. He served as Assistant Attorney General and as Acting Attorney  General. He has drawn editorial praise  and is extremely well qualified, both  academically and professionally, and is  simply being held up because at one  time in the past there was a Republican concern about the need for additional judges on the Circuit Court for  EXHIBIT2  CURRENT JUDICIAL EMERGENCIES WITH NOMINEES  the District of Columbia. And, that  issue has since been satisfied.  ",2008
1169,73,2008-07-17,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, might I inquire of my colleague further on that  precise point?  With regard to the filling of the circuit court for the District of Columbia,  we had testimony by Mr. Roscoe Howard, very recently in the Senate Republican caucus  forum on  judicial confirmations—this was  just  last Monday—that the numbers the majority relies on for that argument that the Senator identified are outdated. He noted  that the Judicial Conference recently  issued statistics indicating that in recent years the DC Circuit Court’s docket has increased and that it has been  processing appeals more slowly because  of additional workload, and this has  corresponded with an increase in the  median wait time between the notice of  appeal and disposition of a case, which,  in fact, he notes is the longest since  1995.  ",2008
1170,73,2008-07-17,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President,  the  Senator from Arizona is correct. The  current statistics show a need for another judge there, and there is no reason to withhold the confirmation of  Peter Keisler, except to keep a vacancy  open with the hope of having the new  President of the other party fill it.  ",2008
1171,73,2008-07-17,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President,  just one  more point.  I also note, when I heard Mr. Howard’s testimony demonstrating further  the need to fill this seat, he noted that  Judge Raymond Randolph of the DC  Circuit recently announced he would be  taking senior status on November 1 of  this year, which means the seat to  which Mr. Keisler is nominated is actually the 10th seat on that circuit. Is  that not correct?  ",2008
1172,73,2008-07-17,Mr. SPECTER., The Senator from Arizona is correct again.  ,2008
1173,73,2008-07-17,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, again I say  to Senator SPECTER, just to confirm  my understanding here, in addition to  Judge Randolph, Judge David Sentelle  currently is eligible for senior status.  Next year, Judge David Tatel  and  Judge Judith Ann Rogers will be eligible for senior status. Judge Karen Henderson and Judge Douglas Ginsburg  will be eligible in 2009 and 2011, respectively. Am I correct on that?  ",2008
1174,73,2008-07-17,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President,  the  Senator from Arizona is correct, yes.  Nominee  ABA  Date vacant  Nomination date  William E.

1180,80,2008-07-17,Ms. KLOBUCHAR.," Mr. President, I  have been coming to the Senate floor  to address the price of oil for several  months now. It continues to astound  me that every time I speak, the prices  continue to go up.  The average price of a gallon of regular gas hit $3.95 in Minnesota and $4.11  cents nationwide. The price of diesel  fuel is at $4.76 per gallon. The price of  crude oil recently hit an unbelievable  $145 per barrel.  There seems to be no relief in sight.  Prices have gone up more than $1 per  gallon over the last 6 months. Everyone knows that demand has not gone  up 25 percent over the last 6 months,  but the prices have gone up $1 per gallon over the last 6 months.  This  increase  is astonishing. Even  more astonishing is the fact that the  administration has  continued  to do  nothing about the speculation  issue,  continues to do nothing to push the  CFTC to use the tools it has and to  push for more tools to do something  about the excessive speculation that is  going on in this market.  We cannot continue to do business as  usual. I have heard from people in Minnesota who have canceled their trips up  to their cabins because they simply  cannot afford to fill their car with gas  anymore. They have  canceled  their  summer vacations. These are not glamorous summer vacations, these are little cabins up on the  lakes of Minnesota.  I have heard from farmers who are  having a hard time making ends meet,  even in spite of the high commodity  prices, because the cost of their input,  diesel fuel for farm equipment and fertilizer made from natural gas, has spiraled out of control.  I have heard from the CEO of Northwest Airlines,  based  in Minnesota,  about how the speculation in the oil  markets has so greatly contributed to  their cost and made it very difficult for  them to continue business as usual  with prices going up, grounding flights,  not having as many  flights  leaving,  leading to more delays in the summer,  because if a passenger misses it, and we  had a hearing on this in the Commerce  Committee—there  are not  as many  backup flights because there are not as  many flights.  So the list goes on. The high price of  energy has inflated the price of everything  from  groceries,  to  transportation, to home heating. It has  impacted every sector of the economy,  from manufacturing  to  forestry,  to  farms and small businesses.  Middle-class  families  are  already  struggling, as you know, with the high  cost of health care and college education. We know we need to do things  about  that,  but  we  keep  getting  blocked. We are very hopeful, with the  new President, that we are going to be  able to get things done for the middle  class.  But for now, we have people in my  State who simply cannot afford the  price of gas when you couple it with everything else that has been going on in  their lives. We know the statistics. We  know what has been happening, where  average families in the last 8 years,  their wages have gone down about  $1,000 a year, but their expenses have  gone up about $4,000; so that is a net  loss of $5,000 a year to them.  Many of the people in my State, and  I know you know this, Mr. Presiding  Officer, in Colorado, many of the people  in my State are  in rural areas.  They do not have access  to public  transportation. They do not have a  choice in how much they drive. They  have to get to work. They have to get  to the grocery store. They have to get  to the doctor. Any pay increase they  have gotten in the last year, if they  have gotten one, has been eaten up by  the cost of gas.  More often than not, I will tell you,  there has not been a pay increase. But  yet, as recently as February of this  year,  the  President  seemed  taken  aback when someone asked him about  $4-a-gallon gas. He said:  You are predicting $4-a-gallon gasoline?  That is interesting. I had not heard that.  The fact is this administration has  failed  to provide Americans with a  meaningful energy policy that would  provide relief from high gas and energy  prices. They saw this coming. They saw  it was going on in the international  markets but they failed to act. This  country needs a bold energy policy for  the future, a policy that will stabilize  prices and give consumers more alternatives and reduce our dependence on  foreign oil and provide us with the next  generation of homegrown biofuels.  In short, I believe we have to invest  in  the people,  the  farmers and  the  workers, from my perspective, of the  Midwest, not the oil cartels of the Mideast. The same could be said of any  area of  this  country. This  country  spends $600,000 every minute on  imported  oil. That money  leaves  the  pockets  of American  drivers,  going  overseas, and contributing to our enormous trade deficit. It amounts to a tax  on the families and businesses of this  country, and  it undermines our national security.  Why does it affect our national security? That  is because America has  roughly 3 percent of the world’s proven  crude oil reserves, but we are responsible for about 25 percent of the world’s  oil consumption. Now, we know we  cannot continue on this path without  becoming more and more vulnerable to  other parts of the world, some of which  are politically unstable, some of which  we do not want to do business with.  But there is another way. If you look  at what is going on in Brazil, they have  achieved energy security with a combination of biofuels. Now, they have  sugarcane, so it is easier. But we have  all kinds of things. We have all kinds of  things: Switchgrass, prairie grass, that  has not even been developed, other  parts of the corn. We know we cannot  do  it all with corn. We are talking  about  algae, we  are  talking  about  biofuels. We are talking about residue  from logging. There are all kinds of  possibilities.  But Brazil was able to do it with a  combination of sugarcane and domestic  production and a government policy  that drove them to energy independence. We need to put together a forward-looking energy policy with the  same sense of urgency we had 40 years  ago when we put a man on the Moon.  In the long term, this is going to  mean  strategic  investment,  putting  these standards in place so people will  push to buy the hybrid cars, electric  cars, new solar technologies, cellulosic  ethanol, other forms of energy for biomass.  We need to have better fuel efficiency  standards for our cars and trucks. I am  proud the Senate, on a bipartisan basis,  for the first time since I was in junior  high school, increased the gas mileage  standards on cars by 10 miles a gallon.  But there is so much more we can do.  We  need  a  renewable  electricity  standard, we need to  look at other  sources, as I said, solar, we need to do  more with nuclear, we need to do more  to  increase responsibly our domestic  production. We need  to have  functioning refineries.  These are long-term solutions. I believe very strongly they are important,  and we need to get them done.  But there is also something we can  do in the short term about high gas  prices that will bring immediate relief;  that  is, to address the role market  speculation is playing in driving up energy prices. The administration likes  to tell us these high gas prices are just  a simple case of supply and demand;  more people are driving, so the price of  gas goes up. We know that is not true  in our country. Fewer people are driving. There have been some increases  internationally, but when the expert,  Mr. Yergin, testified before our committee, he said there has been sort of a  leveling off  in terms of demand  for  world oil. Whatever it is, we know that  even if there has been an increase in  demand, it hasn’t been 25 percent, such  as we have seen with the dollar-a-gallon increase in only the last 6 months.  The answer that it is just supply and  demand doesn’t hold true any longer.  Listen to the oil executives on this  matter. On October 30, 2007, the CEO of  Marathon Oil said:  $100 oil isn’t justified by the physical demand in the market.  On April 11 of this year, the CEO of  Royal Dutch Shell said:  The  [oil]  fundamentals are no problem.  They are the same as they were when oil was  selling for $60 a barrel.  On April 1, a senior vice president of  ExxonMobil testified before the House:  The price of oil should be about $50–55 per  barrel.

1181,108,2008-07-17,Mr.  FEINGOLD.,"  Mr.  President,  today, I am pleased to recognize a man  whose work has touched so many people in Africa and beyond, and whose  life has demonstrated  the power of  transformation.  Tomorrow,  former  South  African  President  Nelson  Mandela will celebrate his 90th birthday and I would like to send him my  very best wishes.  As I have traveled across Africa, I  have witnessed  the  respect Mandela  commands and the pride he evokes in  all Africans, across borders and boundaries. It is nearly unmatched. He is a  symbol of the enduring truth that even  the most intractable systems of repression and violence can be overcome with  courage and persistence.  The lessons of Mandela’s leadership  are made that much more remarkable  when juxtaposed with another African  liberation leader, Robert Mugabe. Upon  being released from jail after 27 years,  Mandela chose to pursue a path of reconciliation  rather  than  retaliation.  When he became President in 1994, he  continued that approach and worked to  unite the country around his vision of  a ‘‘rainbow nation.’’ After one term, he  stepped aside as President, realizing  that institutions must take precedence  over individuals in building a stable democracy. Though South Africa  certainly had its share of problems since—  including a skyrocketing rate of HIV,  increasing political turmoil and a recent  wave  of  xenophobic  attacks  against  immigrants—Mandela  continues to be a voice for peace and stability, a voice of and for all people of  South Africa. The contrast with the  continued bloodshed and repression in  neighboring, Zimbabwe is stark.  President Mandela’s vision for South  Africa not only sought peace within its  borders, but also beyond them. In 1993,  he  famously said that human rights  would be ‘‘the light that guides our foreign  affairs.’’ After  leaving  office,  Mandela continued to embody that vision in South Africa and across the  continent as he  focused on building  support  for  this  critical principle—  whether with civil society groups or  government officials. He has been actively  involved  in  peace  processes  around the world and a leading advocate for global action to address HIV/  AIDS. His willingness  to  speak out  against  injustice wherever  it  festers  has inspired and challenged all of us.  I am gravely concerned that the current South African leadership is moving away from this vision. Its unwillingness  to  publicly  criticize  recent  abuses in Zimbabwe or allow for an expanded mediation is undermining pressure on the Mugabe regime to accept a  transitional government. In addition,  the announcement by the South African Government that it will oppose the  International Criminal Court’s indictment of Sudanese President Al-Bashir  is deeply disappointing. I have deep respect for the leadership South Africa  demonstrates  on  the  continent  and  that is precisely why I challenge its  leaders to play a more active and constructive role  in efforts to promote  peace, security, and democracy.  Mandela’s legacy challenges not only  South Africa, but all of us who care  about the future of Africa. There is a  tendency to look for easy answers or  quick fixes to the challenges facing the  continent today. Mandela’s life is testament to the reality that sustainable  peace and democracy require continued  investment and long-term vision.

MIKE PENCE  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 17, 2008  ",2008
1184,122,2008-07-17,Mr. PENCE.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  honor what would have been the 100th birthday of a great Hoosier legislator and American  patriot, Senator William Jenner.  Born in Crawford County, Indiana, Senator  Jenner graduated with a law degree from Indiana University  in 1930 and began a career  practicing law in Paoli, Indiana. In the meantime, he quickly rose through the ranks of Indiana politicians, becoming Majority Leader and  President Pro Tempore of  the  Indiana State  Senate  less  than  ten years after graduating  from college. In a selfless act that placed the  defense of  freedom above political ambition,  Senator Jenner resigned his seat in the Indiana Senate to serve as a captain in the Army  Air Corps during World War II.  In 1944, Senator Jenner returned from service overseas to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Senate resulting from the death of Frederick Van  Nuys. He would later be elected for two complete terms, serving until 1959.  As  chair  of  the  Internal Security Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee,  Jenner spent much of his time in the Senate  promoting American  values while guarding  against the spread of communist ideals during  a  fragile period of American history. A conservative and a proponent of equality, Senator  Jenner laid out a plan that led to the inclusion  of all races within the Republican Party.  During his  tenure as a politician, Senator  Jenner believed in the ideals of the Senate as  a forum for free-flowing discussion and a body  that protected the viewpoints of the minority.  As he  famously said on January 4th, 1957,  ‘‘Jesus Christ was killed by a majority; Columbus was smeared; and Christians have been  tortured. Had the United States Senate existed  during  those  trying  times,  I am sure  these  people would have  found an advocate. Nowhere else can any political, social, or religious group, finding itself under sustained attack, receive a better refuge.’’  Following his  retirement  from  the Senate,  Jenner returned to law practice in Bedford, Indiana until his death in 1985 at the age of seventy-six. Gone  but  not  forgotten, Madam  Speaker, the legacy of this great Hoosier legislator lives on as a model of courage and patriotism for all members of Congress and indeed, all Americans as well.  f  CELEBRATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF SPECIAL OLYMPICS  HON.

1185,122,2008-07-17,Mr. SESSIONS.," Madam Speaker,  today,  I  have the honor of recognizing the 40th anniversary of Special Olympics. For four decades  Special Olympics has been encouraging and  empowering  individuals with  intellectual disabilities to become active and physically fit in  athletics. Special Olympics have dedicated its  efforts  to provide productive and  respected  members of society  through sports  training  and competition. With 30 Olympic-type summer and winter sports, Special Olympics offer  children and adults with intellectual disabilities  year round training.  Special Olympics currently serve 2.5 million  people with intellectual disabilities in over 180  countries. Special Olympics give these individuals the gift of friendship and allow each of  them to discover a talent of their own. One of  Special Olympics main goals  is  to empower  individuals with intellectual disabilities to realize their full potential and become productive  members of  their  families and  their communities.  As  the  father of a young man with Down  syndrome who competes in Special Olympics,  I have  learned  firsthand  the endearing and  valuable contributions Special Olympics have  on  these  individuals. Special Olympics develop  improved physical  fitness and motor  skills, greater self-confidence and a more positive self-image. Additionally, Special Olympics  allow for individuals to grow socially and mentally  through  their activities, while exhibiting  endless enthusiasm and  joy  throughout  the  games.  I am inspired by the dedication and enthusiasm  for  life  that  these  individuals bring  to  Special Olympics. Once again, it is an honor  to recognize the 40th anniversary of Special  Olympics. Congratulations to all of the athletes  who have competed over the past 40 years.  IN REMEMBRANCE OF AUDREY  SUSANNE CHAPMAN  HON. DENNIS J.

Margaret Sullivan Wilson of  Norwich, Connecticut passed away on Saturday July 12th. I want to take this opportunity  to express my condolences and offer my prayers to her family, as well as honor her service  to her community.  After  graduating  from Willimantic  State  Teachers’ College and getting her Masters in  Education from the University of Connecticut,  Peg Sullivan returned home to Norwich, Connecticut to begin a teaching career. After 44  years of dedicated instruction—from elementary school to college—she retired as an Executive Dean at Eastern Connecticut State  University, where she was honored in 2006 by  the dedication of the Margaret S. Wilson Child  Family Development Complex.  Her  retirement  from  teaching did not end  her tireless commitment to helping others. Peg  was the President of the Thames Valley Council  for Community Action; President of  the  Connecticut Mental Health Association; founder of Norwich, Connecticut’s Head Start program; and in 2004, she founded the Norwich  Historical Society. She also served on  the  Blue Ribbon Commission for the University of  Connecticut Health Center, the White House  Conference  on Children  and  the National  Commission to Reduce Infant Mortality.  She also dedicated herself  to  the change  she believed would help her compatriots. She  served on  the Norwich Board of Education,  the Democratic Town Committee and as a delegate to the 1968 and 1972 Democratic National Conventions.  Her dedication to early childhood education  and educational reform of all kinds did not go  unnoticed. She was honored by the Norwich  Citizen  of  the Year Award  in  1970  and  Natchaug  Hospital  Lifetime  Achievement  Award in May of this year.  Peg Wilson will live on through the memory  of her achievements and the achievements by  those  she  inspired. Peg, we  in Congress  honor your great service and you will truly be  missed.  IN HONOR OF MANUEL SANTANA  HON. SAM FARR  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 17, 2008  ",2008
1189,129,2008-07-17,Mr. FARR.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  honor the life and memory of Manuel Santana,  Santa Cruz County’s 2008 Artist of the Year  and beloved contributor to Central Coast art.  He sadly passed away July 8, 2008, ten days  before he was  to present his award-winning  work at the Museum of Art & History in Santa  Cruz.  Mr. Santana was born on March 31, 1927,  to a  family of Mexican descent, and began  demonstrating his artistic talent in his youth,  drawing bugs and collecting comic books. He  grew up in Los Angeles, initially pursuing a career as a teacher but later discovering his talent as an artist. After moving to Santa Cruz in  1961, Manuel worked diligently as owner of  the  restaurants  Manuel’s  in  Aptos  and  Jardines de San Juan in San Juan Bautista,  all while caring for his family.  Manuel’s art incorporates a deep connection  to Mexican traditions, as well as politics and  social movements like that of Ce´sar Cha´vez.  The  numerous  sculptures,  paintings,  and  acrylics he produced display a vibrant use of  colors, which provide new aspects of  the  pieces with each view.  In addition to art, Mr. Santana was also intimately involved in the community. He founded  the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation at the University of California Santa Cruz,  served on the University of California’s Water  Resources Advisory Board and the Board of  Directors for the Bear Republic Theatre Company, and was president and  lifetime board  member of  the Cabrillo Music Festival. He  also was president of the Central Coast Counties Development Corporation, working to organize and empower  farm workers  in Monterey County.  Many people were touched by Manny’s generous and enlightening spirit, and his passing  leaves  our  community  greatly  saddened.  Madam Speaker, on behalf of  the House,  I  would like to extend our nation’s deep gratitude for Manuel Santana’s commitment to his  local community.  I know  I speak  for every  Member of Congress  in offering my condolences to the entire Santana family: his daughter Angelina, son Leonardo, daughter-in-law  Patricia, and grandchildren Oliver, Joaquin,  and Valentin. California has lost a great citizen, but the legacy he leaves behind is priceless.  f  INTRODUCTION  OF  LEGISLATION  TO ALLOW  FOR  THE  TAX-EXEMPT  BOND  FINANCING  FOR  EMERGENCY MEDICAL AIRCRAFT  HON.

1191,136,2008-07-17,Mr. RANGEL.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to  introduce an Opinion Editorial  from  the  Washington Afro-American News that reflects  support for educating people of color on the  symptoms and prevention of coronary heart  disease.  The editorial which was published on July 5,  2008 is entitled; ‘‘Taking on the Attack: Lessons from Tim Russert’s Death.’’ The author  of the Op-Ed, Honorable ELIJAHE. CUMMINGS,  recognizes the devastating reality of the disease. The  fact  is  that heart disease  is  the  leading cause of death for men and women,  killing more than 700,000 people a year.  The  sudden  death  of  NBC–TV’s  Tim  Russert brings to light the importance of heart  health.  In  the  editorial,  Congressman  states  that  ‘‘African-American  adults are less likely to be diagnosed with coronary heart disease; however, we are more  likely to die from it,’’ emphasizing the disparities that exist among people of color. He advises to quit smoking, engage in regular exercise,  reduce  alcohol  consumption,  reduce  stress and make healthy choices about  the  food that you eat in order to reduce the risk  of heart disease.  Congressman ELIJAHCUMMINGSencourages  everyone to attack the number one killer in the  U.S. by  living heart-healthy  lives and  to acknowledge that ‘‘everyday we wait to adopt a  better lifestyle is another day we put ourselves  at needless risk.’’  CUMMINGS [From the Washington Afro-American News,  July 5, 2008]  TAKINGONTHEATTACK: LESSONSFROMTIM  RUSSERT’SDEATH  (By Elijah E. Cummings)  Shocked. Even this word fails to describe  the reactions of people when they heard  about the sudden end premature death of legendary NBC newsman Tim Russert.  On the day of his wake, hundreds of people  lined up at St. Albans School in Washington,  DC, to pay respect to a man whom they had  never met, but whose death had caused a  deep sense of loss in their lives. Because of  Tim Russert, Sunday was not simply a day of  worship and rest. As he would say, ‘‘If it’s  Sunday, it’s ‘Meet the Press.’’’  He was a top television journalist, a best-  selling author, a statesman in the world of  politics and, more  importantly to him, a  proud husband, father and son.  By all accounts, Tim was as famous as one  could get and, yet, he was an everyday man—  someone to whom we all could relate. So,  when the news spread of his death from a  heart attack at age 58, middle-aged men  across the country got scared. They hit the  gym and passed up dessert.  Women grabbed measuring tape to wrap  around their loved-one’s waists while vowing  to create healthier household diet and fitness regimes to bring those waist circumferences down to below 40 inches. (According  to the American Heart Association, a waistline of more than 40 inches places a man at  a high risk for heart disease.)  The fact is heart disease is the country’s  leading cause of death for men and women,  killing more than 700,000 people a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC).  In the African-American community, the  outlook  is even more  troubling. African-  American adults are less likely to be diagnosed with coronary heart disease; however,  we are more likely to die from it.  We also develop high blood pressure at an  earlier age and, on average, our blood pressure readings are higher than those of other  groups.  In  fact, the prevalence of hypertension in our communities is among the  highest in the world.  Compared to White Americans, ages 45–65,  the premature death rate from heart disease  for Black men is twice as high. For Black  women, it is three times as high.  The statistics are no better in Maryland,  where African Americans make up less than  28 percent of the population, but we experience  the highest  rates  of heart  disease  deaths in the state. According to the CDC,  from  1996  to  2000, African Americans  in  Maryland had a heart disease death rate of  620 per 100,000, compared with 500 per 100,000  for Whites. In Baltimore City, African Americans are 15 percent more likely to die from  heart disease than Whites.  There is good news. Although there are  risk factors for heart disease beyond our control such as increasing age, gender and heredity, there are steps we can take to reduce  the dangers of heart disease.  We must take better care of ourselves. We  can quit smoking, engage in regular exercise, reduce our consumption of alcohol, reduce  the  stress  in  our  lives  and make  healthy choices about the food that we eat.  We must educate ourselves. In the case of  a heart attack, every second counts and we  have done an excellent job of informing men  of the signs and symptoms they may have  when experiencing a heart attack (including  chest pain, shortness of breath and discomfort in the arms).  We have neglected  to  similarly  inform  women of the symptoms that they are more  likely to experience. Shortness of breath,  nausea, vomiting and back or jaw pain are  all common symptoms of heart attack in  women, and far too many lives are lost because women—and, sadly, their health care  providers—are unaware of these symptoms.  We must continue to challenge the disparities in health care that disproportionately  threaten our communities. People of color  have limited access to affordable, high-quality health care. When heart disease occurs,  we are less likely to receive life-saving medical interventions like coronary angiography  and coronary revascularization.  We continue to face the reality that too  little research funding is being focused upon  the health risks that threaten minority communities. These harsh facts of life are now  publicly acknowledged by leaders in every  political party. The critical test will be our  willingness to allocate the public  funding  that is needed to eliminate race as a mortality factor in this country.  Last year, I was proud to join Mayor Sheila Dixon, Del. Shirley Nathan Pulliam and  Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr.  Joshua Sharfstein in announcing an initiative to reduce cardiovascular disease and unacceptable health disparities in the Baltimore region.  This effort relies heavily on community  input to help develop strategies to prevent  suffering  and  save  lives  through  public  health efforts. The proposed strategies include launching a task force on reducing sodium intake; expanding community health  worker programs: and developing partnerships with faith-based institutions.

1192,6,2008-07-28,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, this is an  indisputable fact. Any efforts to portray  this  legislation as a  spending  bill—much  less a  reckless  spending  bill—are indisputably false.  We have been down this road before.  Earlier this year, the same Republican  Senator who is the leading obstructor  of these bills did the same thing for a  package of  lands bills. We acted  in  good  faith and negotiated a  set of  amendments with him so that his concerns would receive full and fair consideration on the Senate floor. Those  familiar with our negotiations would  surely agree that we offered him a far  more generous arrangement for amendments than many Democrats or Republicans would have thought his objections merited. But after spending considerable  time  negotiating  in  good  faith, it became clear this Senator was  not serious about reaching an agreement. Then, like now, we tried to pass  the more than 60  initiatives  in the  lands package as stand-alone legislation. Those efforts were obstructed by  the Republican side. After months of  delay, we finally voted on the lands  package. This package passed the Senate by a vote of 91 to 4. Every one of  them is now law. The American people  are benefiting from each one of them.  Some Republican Senators take another approach to explain their obstruction to this legislation. They say  it  is an effort to preserve minority  rights.  Democrats have been more than willing to open debate on amendments,  even on legislation such as this where  we are baffled by Republican opposition. If the Republican Senator or Senators who are blocking this legislation  are  serious  about  having  concerns  heard on the floor, they should offer an  opportunity to do that—they are certainly entitled to it—but it is clear  that the ultimate goal is to make political points at the expense of millions  of Americans who would be assisted by  these very important pieces of legislation. Republican Senators have acted  within their rights to block and delay  action, but simply being within their  rights does not make it right.  Some Republicans make one  final  spurious argument  for opposing this  legislation: that it takes us off the energy legislation.  As we learned a few minutes ago, I  offered unanimous  consent  that we  would stay on the Energy bill and that  this would not  set  it aside.  If we  worked on this, we would be right back  on Energy. Democrats have tried again  and again to legislate on energy prices.  We  have  introduced  proposals  that  would  lower gas prices  in the short  term while addressing the root cause of  the problem in the long term. We have  even offered Republicans exactly what  they claim to want: votes on drilling,  oil shale, nuclear energy, and their entire package.  In Congressional Daily today, this  appeared on the back page. It says:  Cheaper, faster, safer options exist to solve  the oil crisis. Don’t buy Big Oil’s lie.  Then it has a picture of a big oil rig  out in the middle of the ocean. It says:  Drilling for oil in America’s precious natural areas will NOT lower gas prices. But Big  Oil’s profits will skyrocket even higher.  The U.S. Department of Energy’s truth:  The  Energy  Information  Administration  says offshore or Arctic Refuge oil won’t flow  for ten years and prices won’t be affected  until at least 2027.  This is from President’s Bush’s Department of Energy.  The impact on price? ‘‘Insignificant.’’  The U.S. Department of  the  Interior’s  truth: The number of drilling permits on federal  lands doubled  in the  last  five years  while the price of gas almost tripled. More  drilling does not lower prices.  The U.S. House Committee on Natural  Resources’s truth: Oil and gas companies  hold leases to millions of acres of Federal  land and waters. These leases are producing  no oil.  Legendary oil man T. Boone Pickens’s  truth—  And this is a direct quote—  I’ve been an oil man all my life, but this is  one emergency we can’t drill our way out of.  He said that about a month ago.  The plain truth: While the American public  struggles to pay record-breaking gas prices,  big oil companies rake in record-breaking  profits.  The U.S. holds 2 percent of all the oil reserves,  but  consumes  25  percent  of  the  world’s oil. We can’t drill our way to energy  independence. Energy efficiency, renewables,  and technological advances are the cheaper,  faster, safer way to meet America’s energy  needs, while reducing the threat of global  warming.  Tell them you don’t buy Big Oil’s lie and  they shouldn’t either.  This has been paid for by a number of  organizations. Some are strictly environmental. Some of  them are  concerned about other things. Ocean Conservancy helped pay for this.

1196,13,2008-07-28,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President,  it  is  time for this debate. No, this debate is  overdue. It is about time the American  people understand the choices we are  making on the  floor of the Senate.  Every month this President asks us for  $12 billion to $15 billion to wage the  war. Is it paid for? No. It is added to  the deficit. We are told we have to do  it; we have to do it, not just for the  troops—no one wants to see the troops  go without—but because it is our moral  responsibility, according to the Bush  administration, to rebuild Iraq. We liberated them. We removed their dictator. We have lost over 4,000 of our  best and bravest lives and thousands  injured. But month after month, the  administration  tells us we need  to  spend $10 billion to $15 billion on the  war  in  Iraq. The protests  from the  other side of the aisle are few, if any,  to this President’s plan to spend $12  billion to $15 billion a month in Iraq.  Now comes this bill. This bill suggests  spending money  in America.  What do we hear? A chorus of complaints from the other side of the aisle  that  it  is wasteful—wasteful—to be  spending money in America, projects  that are new Federal programs, questioning whether there is wisdom behind  them,  whether  taxpayers’  dollars  should be spent.  The American people should be the  judge. Should we be spending American  taxpayers’ dollars to establish a national registry for those suffering from  Lou Gehrig’s disease in the hopes we  might learn something that leads to a  cure? Obviously,  the House of Representatives felt it was. That rollcall  was 411 to 3. But there is objection on  the Republican side of the aisle: a new  program.  Then there  is the Christopher and  Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, calling on  the National Institutes of Health for  paralysis research and rehab activities,  a new program, I will admit it. But if  it was a member of my family stuck in  a wheelchair, quadriplegic, you can bet  I would be begging for this bill. How  did it do in the House of Representatives? It passed unanimously, but it is  held up on the Republican side of the  aisle because  it  is money  spent  in  America for a new program.  Here is another. Stroke Treatment  and Ongoing Prevention Act, a bipartisan bill. Senator KENNEDY, fighting  brain cancer in Massachusetts, cannot  be here to stand and speak for it. I will  speak for it. He and Senator COCHRAN,  a Republican from Mississippi, believe  this  is money well spent on stroke  treatment  in America. It  is another  new program, and it is here for America. It is opposed by the Republican  side of the aisle.  Why? Why do they want to stop these  programs that help us here at home?  The list goes on and on. Postpartum  depression.  I  joined  Congressman  BOBBYRUSHin pushing this one when a  lady, a few days after giving birth in  Chicago, dove out a hospital window,  killing herself—suicide. We don’t want  that to happen. This bill tries to help  mothers struggle through postpartum  depression.  Vision care for kids—more money to  be spent in the United States. It is opposed by those who are putting a hold  on these bills.  All these bills overwhelmingly passed  the House of Representatives without  any bipartisan rancor, until they got  over here. Many of the same Senators  who have voted for a blank check to  send money to Iraq month after month  do not want to spend money in America. I think a strong America begins at  home. It begins with good health care.  It begins when we care about our own  people first.  Then there are the Judiciary Committee bills. The Senator from Oklahoma  is a member of the Judiciary  Committee. Every one of these bills he  had a chance to amend in the committee. Every one of these bills came  out of committee by unanimous vote,  which would include his vote. Now he  is objecting to moving forward on the  floor.  He does not want us to pass the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act to authorize an  increase  in authorization  levels for runaway kids or the Emmett  Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act to  try to finally bring to justice those  guilty of killing a lot of the great people in America who have been victims  of civil rights crimes.  The Mentally Ill Offender Treatment  and Crime Reduction Act. Mental illness is such an integral part of many  criminal acts. We want to do something about it. It passed unanimously  out of the committee, but it is money  spent in America, and they object to it.  They object to this money being spent.  Why?  Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act. Who favors that? No one  favors that. Why won’t we spend a few  dollars to stop it? You know what is  going on in the Internet. How did that  bill do? It passed the House of Representatives 409 to 0. There were no  breakdowns. Democrats  and Republicans all agreed we have to stop this  scourge, until it came over here and  was stopped by the Senator from Oklahoma. I don’t understand his thinking  on all this. Let me make one thing  clear. These are authorization bills.  They do not spend money. They authorize us to spend money, but that authorization has to be followed up with  actual spending, and we are limited in  the total amount we can spend. If we  want to put money  into these programs, it has to be taken from other  programs.  Many of the same Senators who vote  month after month to send money to  Iraq, many of the same Senators who  voted for tax breaks for the wealthiest  people in America in the midst of a  war, are saying we cannot afford this  money for medical research and money  to make America safer. That is what  this vote is all about.  I reserve the remainder of my time.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.  ",2008

Was  the Senator  from Oklahoma  aware that I have been pressing to get  an amendment, along with Senator  KOHL,  a  bipartisan  amendment,  to  bring OPEC nations under the antitrust laws so they could not meet in a  room, lower production, lower supply,  and thereby raise the price of oil in the  international market?

1218,20,2008-07-28,Mr. COBURN.," I will not take but a  moment longer. I think it is fair to  allow the majority leader to regain the  floor.  The Senate I know and the Senate I  studied was not about limiting debate.  It was not about having a Rules Committee of one, it was about unlimited  debate, germane but unlimited. It was  about amendments. It was about using  the parliamentary rules we have in a  fair and straightforward way to advance what you thought was best for  this country.  The majority leader has the toughest  position in this body. It is a hard job.  There  is no question. I defer to his  judgment. I am not critical of his judgment. I am sorry for the Senate that  we are to the point now where we can  only move legislation when it is approved and the amendments are approved by the majority leader and his  leadership.  I think that  fails the test of our  Founders’  version  of  the Senate.  I  think we will rue the day that we have  gone down this path. But I will continue to use every parliamentary maneuver I know to lessen Washington’s  wasteful spending, to pass good bills  and make them better and not to say  that just because you do not approve of  a unanimous consent request that you  do not have something to offer.  The fact is, we have passed 855 bills  by unanimous consent. I may have let  too many go. But the fact is we negotiated with a lot of people and got a lot  of bills through. The frustration factor  is part of the Senate. Working together  we  solve problems, working against  each other what we do is we lower the  rate of acceptability and confidence in  this body to the 9 percent it has today.  My hat is off to HARRYREID for the  amount of time he has put  in, the  amount of effort he puts in it. I would  hope he would choose to go a different  way, reaching across the aisle, working  across  the  aisle. Everybody’s  ideas  have value. Everybody’s input should  be offered and there should be real negotiation.  One  last  comment. This  omnibus  package of bills had 34 bills in it. There  were only three bills that I absolutely  opposed, nine bills I never objected to  at all. And every other bill in that I  made  an  offer  to  reach  out,  offer  amendments, offer suggestions. Most of  the time it was flatly rejected: We are  going to roll over you. You cannot  have input.  If that is the way the Senate operates, then we are going to be back here  a lot of times in the future. I know,  pretty heady times, thinking that we  may not have the power to do that. But  that power, if it goes away, will not  last for very long being in absence. It  will be back. The American people get  it.  This country is on a crashing course,  financially. Fiscally, we cannot handle  what is happening to us. Until we start  handling the problems now that are  going to be the crisis in the future, we  will fail the American public.  I yield the floor.  ",2008

1222,27,2008-07-28,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, I thank  the Senator from Illinois. I thank him  for his debating skills and his heartfelt  positions.  I guess the first thing I would say is  the Appropriations Committee spends  $875 billion every year that is not authorized. The Senator  from  Illinois  knows that.  The second thing I would say is there  is no ability to amend any of these  bills in the appropriations process, unless you are on  the Appropriations  Committee. So if you are not on the  subcommittee, you can’t amend it. If  you are not on the main committee,  you can’t amend it.  Last year, we couldn’t amend anything because the omnibus bill came to  the floor without any ability to amend  it. So we haven’t had any opportunity  to amend it. It is whatever the appropriators say goes. There is no amendment with that.  I am not going to get into the debate.  I am as disgusted with Republican  spending priorities as the Senator from  Illinois is. I will correct the record on  real accounting principles. We had 1  year, and 1 year only, of a true surplus,  1999. The rest of the years we didn’t  have a surplus, if you count what we  borrowed from Social Security.  I would not defend any of the spending of this President or this Congress,  but I will make it known the President  cannot spend the first penny until Congress passes the bills. I note that over  the last 18 months, his party has not  been in charge. A different party has  been  in charge. The bills that have  gone to him have been controlled by  the majority party.  Look, both of us admit that our children are in tall weeds right now if we  don’t start doing something about our  fiscal situation.  The final point I will make is most of  these bills would take  less than an  hour. Every one of them I have communicated on and I am happy to see on  the floor. Give me the right to offer  one  significant amendment and one  amendment for every billion dollars. I  will debate it for 15 minutes, have two  votes, and we will be done with the  bills.  Nobody  is withholding  anybody’s  right to vote for a bill. The majority  leader can put any bill he wants on the  floor at any time, with my agreement  to never try to dilatate, never try to  spread it out, to only bring pertinent  amendments that are germane and do  that in a very short period of time. He  knows that. The Senator from Illinois  has known that. That has been the way  I work. I don’t play the games of political position to spin something.  My hope is—and I have a great relationship with the Senator from Illinois.  I value his friendship. He is not ‘‘just  my friend,’’ he is a friend. It is not the  collegial statement of the body, it is  DICKDURBIN is my friend. My hope is  that when DICKDURBINand I can pass  three significant bills out of our subcommittee that make a real difference  in the world of human rights, that if we  can do that, then certainly the Senate  can come together on energy and all  these other bills. My hope is we will do  that.  I do not want to delay our staff or  the Presiding Officer any longer.  I yield the floor.  f  MORNING BUSINESS  ",2008

1225,27,2008-07-28,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I wish to  commend Mr. Vincent P. Farri on his  promotion  to Lieutenant with  the  United  States  Capitol  Police. Mr.  Farri, a native of Maryland, joined the  Capitol Police on January  31,  1989.  After initial training at the Federal  Law Enforcement Training Center he  worked  with  the  Capitol  Division  Building Patrol, and performed general  duties until 1993. In 1993, Mr. Farri was  assigned to the uniform protective detail for the President pro tempore of  the Senate. I came to know Mr. Farri  during this time and observed that on  a daily basis he executed his duties in  a  highly  professional,  diligent  and  courteous manner.  In 1998, Mr. Farri served as a senior  patrol officer in the Capitol Building,  and occasionally worked as an acting  sergeant, making  rounds  and  supporting officers at their posts. While  performing  in this capacity, Vincent  Farri distinguished himself on July 24,  1998. On that fateful day, an armed assailant entered the Capitol and suddenly took the lives of two Capitol Policemen. Officer Farri, hearing shots  from the floor above, immediately ran  to the scene where he came upon the  fallen officers, and assisted in apprehending the gunman. All those who  work in and visit the Capitol owe deep  gratitude to the police men and women  who serve and protect us, and we are  especially grateful for the service rendered by Vincent and the sacrifice of  his fellow officers on that day.

1226,34,2008-07-28,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, after  36 years of service to our Nation, GEN  Dick Cody will conclude his military  career on August 1. I salute his leadership and honor his lovely wife Vicki,  for her invaluable support of her husband and our soldiers.  Dick Cody began his service more  than 40 years ago, leaving his family’s  car dealership in Vermont and reporting to West Point.  He has served our Nation on battlefields and bases around the world, commanding our  soldiers,  including  the  famed Screaming Eagles of our 101st  Airborne Division.  General Cody’s service as operations  officer and later vice chief of staff, reminds me of GEN George C. Marshall’s  service as our Army’s Chief of Staff  during World War II. Marshall noted  that before the war, he had ‘‘time’’ to  prepare the Army, but ‘‘no money.’’  After France fell to the Nazis, Marshall  said he had  ‘‘money, but no  time.’’ Dick Cody  faced similar circumstances and deserves our gratitude  for preparing our soldiers to fight the  war against terrorism.  Our Army entered this war with significant  equipment  shortages.  Our  forces were organized to fight the Cold  War rather than the vastly different  global war on terror.  Since September 11, 2001, with funds  provided by Congress, Cody has directed the  fielding of 94 new Army  equipment programs worth over $100  billion. He orchestrated  the Army’s  largest restationing and construction  program in 70 years. He directed the  most sweeping transformation of our  Army since the dawn of mechanized  warfare.  He oversaw the conversion of our Reserve components to a critical part of  our operational forces, and supervised  the addition of 65,000 new soldiers to  our  forces. He has also been  instrumental in ensuring our wounded soldiers receive the treatment and care  which they deserve.  Vicki Cody supported her husband,  and his soldiers, throughout their 33  years of marriage. She cared for our  military families during training missions and deployments, often while her  own husband was serving far from his  family.  Dick and Vicki raised two sons, Clint  and Tyler, both U.S. Army captains,  with six combat deployments between  them. When young Dick Cody  left  Vermont, and Cody Chevrolet, he truly  started a new ‘‘family business.’’  Our Nation is grateful for his leadership, and we wish him and Vicki all the  best as they begin a new chapter of  their lives.∑  f  MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE  ENROLLED JOINT RESOLUTION  SIGNED  At 5:53 p.m., a message  from the  House of Representatives, delivered by  Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks,  announced that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. HOYER) has signed the following enrolled joint resolution:  H.J.

1245,5,2008-09-16,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. BURGESS) for 5 minutes.  ,2008
1246,5,2008-09-16,Mr. BURGESS.," Before I came to the  United States Congress, in another life,  I was a physician, and oftentimes when  I was introduced to speak at an engagement back home, the person doing the  introductions will say, Do you want to  be referred to as Doctor or Congressman? I usually start off with perhaps a  little lighthearted humor in that, Well,  physicians still enjoy about a 70 to 80  percent approval rating with the American public, and Members of Congress  enjoy about a 7 to 8 percent approval  rating with the country. So, mother always called me Doctor, and that  is  what I’d prefer to be called. But it’s  really a sad commentary on the institution that our credibility is at such a  low ebb.  Now we just had the gentleman from  Tennessee talk about an editorial in  the New York Times. Since he brought  it up, let me refer attention to the New  York Times from yesterday. Reading it  on  the airplane up here,  they  referenced the fact that we have a serious  problem with  the  chairman of  our  Ways and Means Committee and the  credibility has been lost for the individual who is head of the largest tax-  writing body  in  the House of Representatives.  The Tax Code in this country is complex. No one understands it. People understand how mistakes can be made.  But the chairman of that body, at the  very least, ought to hold himself above  reproach. And yes, maybe one transgression,  perhaps  two,  but  transgression  after  transgression  after  transgression is more than the American people can tolerate.  We are going to debate an energy bill  today. But the fact is we are not really  going to accomplish anything on energy. Yes, I know they have the votes.  They can pass pretty much whatever  they want. They can ram  it to the  floor, like they did last night, 15 minutes before it goes to the Rules Committee, and then here on the floor, as if  by magic, today. But this bill is dead  on arrival in the Senate. It is going to  do nothing to help the American people.  Here’s the tragedy. Out in the countryside, no one believes that we have  the ability to do much of anything. We  couldn’t talk about border security or  immigration reform because we have  no credibility. We can’t  talk about  what we are going to do with the economy because we have no credibility.  The credibility of  this  institution  was badly damaged prior to the 2006  election, and I grant you it was an  election strategy by the other side that  worked. Paint the working majority at  that time as one that wasn’t working,  and we will get to take credit for it and  we will get to take power.  So look at where we are today, 221⁄2  months later. Are we out of Iraq? I  don’t think so. Are gas prices lower? I  don’t think so. All of those things were  promised during the run-up to the last  election. And, yes, they promised to be  the most ethical and competent Congress that the country had seen  in  quite some time.  Now I call on the 30 new Members on  the majority side who were elected on  this platform to stand up. Stand up in  your conference and be counted. Now is  the time. We have a serious crisis of  credibility on one of the major committees in the United States Congress,  and we can’t get past that point. One  individual holds in his hand the power  to begin to restore some of the credibility to the  institution that we so  sorely need.  I call on the freshmen Democrats to  ask the chairman to step aside, whether  temporarily or permanently, but  step aside until he solves his own problems so that the institution is not left  carrying that weight. I think the institution of the House of Representatives  deserves no less than that courtesy at  a time when our economy is suffering,  our energy prices are high, and certainly the ability of the country to defend  the border has been  seriously  questioned. This is the time.  This is the time that the House needs  to have maximum credibility to get  these issues accomplished and, at the  same time, here we are talking about  the same things and over and over  again.  Again, I call on the freshmen Members, stand up to your Speaker, stand  up to the powerful committee chairmen. Let’s move past this point. You  have other capable members on the  majority side on the Committee on  Ways and Means who can serve, either  temporarily or permanently, to serve  that body, and  let’s move past this  point.  It’s time. The American people are  waiting on us to do the big work, and  we can’t do it because we are bound up  in these seemingly endless quandaries  that we find ourselves in. Let’s show  the American people that we can lead.  Maybe then they will restore some of  the credibility to us.

1247,12,2008-09-16,Mr. AL GREEN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Ike came through Texas,  landed near Houston. Much of the area  in my State, especially in the Houston-  Galveston area along the gulf coast,  has been decimated. It will take billions of dollars for us to recover.  We are asking that this House understands the needs of the people of Texas  and  the areas  that have been devastated. We will have to lend some assistance to the areas that need our help  at a most important time.  For fear that someone may not understand, we are truly all in this together. Dr. King reminded us that life  is an inescapable network of mutuality  tied to a single garment of destiny.  Whatever  impacts one directly,  impacts all indirectly.  Though you may live in some far corner of the United States of America,  there are earthquakes, there are fires,  there are storms that will come into  your life. We are all going to need some  help at some point.  So I am begging those of you who  can, please understand that we have  got  to help Texans and Americans  through this.  f  ALLOW OPEN, FULL AND FAIR  DEBATE  (Mr. WESTMORELAND  asked  and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",2008
1248,12,2008-09-16,Mr. WESTMORELAND.," Mr. Speaker,  this bill that was introduced last night  at 9:45 has the same MO as the other  lies that the Democratic Party have  told the American people.  I quote here from A Congress Working for all Americans, something put  out by the then-Democratic minority  trying to become the majority. ‘‘Bills  should generally come  to  the  floor  under a procedure that allows open,  full and fair debate consisting of a full  amendment process.’’ More smoke and  mirrors to get elected.  In fact, Mr. PAULKANJORSKIstated it  best when he was talking to a reporter  about  the  promises  the Democrats  made on the campaign trail, ‘‘We sort  of stretched the truth, and people ate  it up.’’ They have stretched the truth.  Speaker PELOSIin April 2006, said, we  have a plan to lower the skyrocketing  price gas prices. It was $2.06 at the  time. Now, as you know, it’s over $4.  But Mr. DEFAZIO from Oregon told  the truth. He said, ‘‘It is sad to see the  Republicans come to this.’’ Now they  laughingly say this will lead to higher  prices.  The energy bill they passed in January of 2007 has caused gas prices to  double. This is a sham.  ",2008
1249,12,2008-09-16,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of  Texas.," Mr. Speaker, the Bush-Cheney  energy plan, supported by the Republican majority here in Congress, is 95  percent  implemented. Yet the prices  have increased by 150 percent. For the  last 12 years, up until this term, the  Republicans have been in the majority,  along with the President.  Democrats have been the majority  less than 2 years, and we are trying to  put together a piece of legislation that  brings in every aspect of some type of  resolution for the energy shortage. All  of us know that drilling alone is not  the answer.  We can drill all we want to. The population of the world has gotten so large  that there is no way it’s going to be  enough to do what we need to do. We  have got to do alternative fuels that’s  in this bill, even including the possibility of nuclear energy.  I will support this bill strongly because it has a multiple number of ways  to address this problem.  f  DEMOCRAT INACTION ON FAILING  TO ADOPT A  COMPREHENSIVE  ENERGY POLICY  (Mr. LATTA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2008
1250,12,2008-09-16,Mr. LATTA.," Mr. Speaker, the Democrat inaction on failing to adopt a comprehensive  energy  policy has  come  home to roost. We see this happened in  the last hurricane. We have over 20 percent of our oil being produced in the  gulf, and  these oil  rigs being  shut  down, and the refineries being shut  down.  Americans are suffering. We have to  diversify. Once again, when you look at  the energy proposals here, we have to  be up  in ANWR. There’s 10.3 billion  barrels of oil up there that we need to  be drilling. We have got to get that oil  down here.  We have to make sure that there is  natural gas, make sure that people can  heat their homes this winter. We have  to make sure that the folks that are  out there driving trucks or tractors  have diesel. We have to have that to  make sure we keep our energy prices  down and our food prices down.  But the time to act is now. We have  to have a comprehensive energy plan.  The Republicans have put forward all  of the above. All of the above is to  make sure that we have nuclear, clean  coal technology, hydro. We have to  make sure that we drill, that we make  sure that we have all of the alternatives out there, but we have to do it  now. If we don’t get it done now, the  rest the world will pass us by. Next  year China is becoming the number one  manufacturing country in the world.  It’s time to act right now.  f  f  DRILLING ALONE IS NOT THE  ANSWER  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of  Texas asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)  SEEING THE EFFECT OF  REPUBLICAN POLICIES  (Mr. DAVIS of Illinois asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2008
1251,12,2008-09-16,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  the truth is that from 2001 to 2007, Republicans controlled all levels of power  here in Washington. It was their opportunity to put the conservative economic ideas that they have been talking about  for decades  into  law, and  they did it.  Today we see the effect of these policies. Middle-class  families are being  squeezed by wages that have actually  fallen by  $300  since President Bush  took office, 3.4 million more Americans  are  unemployed,  5.7 million more  Americans are living in poverty.  Foreclosure rates have hit a record  high with 2.5 million families expected  to lose their homes this year. The dollar  remains weak because President  Bush  continues  to  borrow  record  amounts of money from other countries.  This is the economy Washington Republicans created with policies towards  the needs of the wealthiest few over  those  of  hard-working, middle-class  Americans. Now Senator MCCAINvows  to continue those same economic policies if he wins the Presidency.  That does not sound like change to  me.  f  NO ENERGY BILL  (Mrs. MUSGRAVE asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2008
1252,12,2008-09-16,Mrs. MUSGRAVE.," Mr. Speaker, the  Democrat  no-energy  bill  before  us  today is an absolute travesty. The bill  will permanently lock up the first 50  miles of coastline and keep the next 50  miles under lock and key until coastal  States pass a law permitting production.  They don’t have any incentive to do  so, so it essentially locks up the first  100 miles of coastline where most of  our  resources are  located. This bill  does not share any royalty revenues  with coastal States, giving them absolutely no incentive to approve production off their coast.  Under  current  policy,  producing  States receive royalties from offshore  production. This bill does not provide  funding for environmental restoration  or a sustainable funding mechanism to  develop alternative and renewable energy sources, which would decrease our  dependence on foreign oil.  This bill includes an unworkable, renewable energy standard.  In States like mine, Colorado, we are  well positioned to utilize renewables.  Other States will be unable to meet  this unrealistic hurdle, costing consumers untold increases.  Speaker PELOSI, you can fool all of  the people some of the time, some of  the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the  time. This is a travesty.

1253,19,2008-09-16,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  the most pressing, the most urgent  issue facing the American people today  is energy policy, gas prices. Yet the  strongest Nation, the greatest Nation  in the world is 70 percent reliant on  foreign oil.  Now, the good news is that there are  wonderful and incredible alternatives  and opportunities to create American  energy for Americans. The problem is  that this Democrat bill today will not,  will not allow any new supply.  The reason the American people are  so disgusted with Congress is because  of this style of leadership: closed, unfair, un-American. This is most frustrating and concerning to the American people because they know that  there are positive alternatives.  Madam Speaker,  fulfill your duty.  Allow a vote on the American energy  bill. Honor your oath.  f  COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY ACT  (Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2008
1254,19,2008-09-16,Mr. PERLMUTTER.," Mr. Speaker, it’s  great to be here this morning to talk in  favor of a Comprehensive Energy Act  that we’re going to bring up on the  floor today.  My friends on the other side have  been complaining  for weeks that we  don’t have a comprehensive energy bill.  We’ve passed bill after bill really designed to focus on new ways to power  America. We can’t be hooked on just  one commodity anymore. We’re hooked  on oil. We are beholden to eight countries, most of which don’t like us, and  five oil companies. So we’re always  sort of at risk, and we’ve seen that this  year with the price going straight up.  So we’ve got a bill that talks about  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy,  and incorporates domestic drilling all  over the place, quite frankly, coal, a  whole variety of things.  It’s going to take our coming across  the board with new policies with respect to energy to break our dependence on foreign oil. That’s what this  bill does.  And I always say, is it any wonder  with two oilmen in the White House  that  the price of oil went  straight  through the roof?  f  PEOPLE NEED HELP IN AMERICA  (Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2008
1255,19,2008-09-16,Mr. GOHMERT.," Mr. Speaker, I just  came back from a weekend of being  with my constituents that were hit by  a hurricane. They don’t care about Republican or Democrat, and they cannot  find a generator that’s a hybrid generator. They need help.  And when I went and was dealing  with sheriffs that were trying to get  help for their people in the middle of  the night, one of them said, You know  I’m a Democrat. I said, You know I  don’t care.  People need help in America, and this  bill that’s been put on the floor will  provide none of the above. The litigation has stopped 68 million acres from  being drilled, and now once we  find  that out, we find out that’s their ace in  the hole to keep this bill from producing anything.  People want hope. People need gasoline. They need diesel. They don’t need  a  joke that  is turned  into a mean,  mean, hurtful bill.  f  THE REPUBLICANS DON’T WANT  TO FIX THE ENERGY PROBLEM  (Mr. OLVER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2008
1256,19,2008-09-16,Mr. OLVER.," Mr. Speaker, our Republican colleagues are saying that H.R.  6899, the Comprehensive Energy Policy  Act that this House will debate and  pass later today, is a sham.  Let me remind them, H.R. 6899 contains essentially the same drilling language they demanded a vote on in June  and July. Yet, they will vote against it  today just as they did in June and July  when  they  voted  against  requiring  drilling in the already leased National  Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, against  cracking  down  on  speculation,  and  against releasing a small portion of the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  The truth is, they don’t want to even  begin to fix the problem. They only  want to distract public attention from  eight disastrous years of the Bush administration.  A failing economy, a failing foreign  policy, a clearly failed energy policy,  and no new ideas.  f  THE WORKING CLASS ARE GETTING STIFFED BY THE DEMOCRAT ENERGY BILL  (Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to  revise and extend her remarks.)  Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, back  in the Fifth  Congressional District in Florida, I tell  people  I came  from a dysfunctional  family. My father was a Democrat. My  mother was a Republican. But let me  tell you, my father was a Democrat because he thought that the Democrat  Party was for the working class.  Ladies and gentlemen in this Chamber,  the working  class  are  getting  stiffed by this bill. It’s interesting because since the Democrats took control  of both the Houses, gasoline has gone  up over $1 a gallon. Now you know  what that means? That means that the  working class and the middle class are  really getting hurt.  The bill that we have before us today  is not one that’s going to produce any  kind of energy. Let me tell you why.  First of all,  lawsuits will stop any  drilling. There’s no consolidation or  method  to consolidate any  lawsuits  that may be brought by numerous environmental  groups.  Certainly,  we  want to protect the environment, but  you know what,  this bill does not  produce one ounce of any kind of petroleum product.

1258,26,2008-09-16,Mr. FLAKE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I guess that some on  the majority side think that they can  cover up just by yelling or by raising  the volume here of debate.  The bottom line here is, and the reason for this point of order, is that the  majority party thought that, all right,  we can have a bill here, or we can  sneak something in. Let’s sneak a limited tax benefit for New York.  You can call it an earmark, that’s  the proper definition when you have a  limited tax benefit. You can call it a  banana. You can call it anything you  want to. The bottom line is the majority tried to sneak something into a  broader bill that’s supposed to be about  energy, and that’s what this is about.  So nobody is trying to distract anybody, other than those who are trying  to slip a provision in that doesn’t have  to do with any comprehensive energy  plan. It has to do with New York.  You can raise your voice, and you  can yell all you want. The bottom line  is somebody tried to sneak a limited  tax benefit into this legislation. That’s  why I support the point of order.  ",2008

1264,26,2008-09-16,Mr. CANTOR.," Mr. Speaker, all  I  would say is the histrionics that we  have already seen on the majority side  of the aisle indicate the sensitivity of  the matter of earmarks.  We, I think, all have noticed that the  public has an increasing awareness of  the way that this body operates, and  they have a great dissatisfaction aimed  towards this process. That’s why we  raise this issue. It is just completely  unfair.  It  smacks of a  smoke-filled  room,  behind-closed-doors  dealings  that is not befitting of this institution.  Frankly, it is not what the American  people want, nor what they deserve.  b1245  That is the reason for raising this  question surrounding the $1.2 billion  that has been requested by what reports have said was Chairman RANGEL  of the Ways and Means Committee.  Again, on their own, liberty bonds  should stand a test of this House; but it  should not be a provision inserted in a  bill that is meant to increase American  energy production so that we can bring  down gas prices.  Mr. Speaker, with that I yield back  the balance of my time.  ",2008

Initially this  was air-dropped into the overall bill to  help New York recover after 9/11 by  Chairman Thomas. So I guess to some  degree Chairman Thomas is responsible  for this particular provision being here  today, without consultation with not  only  the  ranking member, CHARLIE  RANGELat the time, or MIKEMCNULTY  from New York State. Even his own  colleague from the Republican side of  the aisle, Amo Houghton at the time  who was a Member, was not consulted  about the addition of this into the legislation.  ",2008

1270,33,2008-09-16,Mr. GREEN.,  ,2008
1271,33,2008-09-16,Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, I would  like to thank our  Chair  of  the Rules Committee  for  yielding to me. I rise in strong support  of our legislation H.R. 6899, The Comprehensive American Energy Security  and Taxpayer Protection Act and this  rule.  Why we identify this as a comprehensive bill is very simple. Our country  needs a comprehensive legislation that  deals with energy. We need everything  for our country to both be energy efficient but also to be able to afford it.  All sides of debate can longer insist on  the ‘‘it’s my way or the highway’’ approach to energy. We need all energy  resources, both conventional and renewable. And everyone must be willing  to  sacrifice  to  reach  that  common  ground.  I do not believe our bill goes  far  enough to address all of our domestic  energy  resources,  especially nuclear  energy. But however in every shortcoming there are positive concessions.  Our legislation improves on a provision  included in the original H.R. 6 by at  least freezing independent oil and natural gas producers at their current section 199 manufacturing deduction rate  instead of a complete repeal. Our bill  modifies provisions from the flawed use  of ‘‘use it or lose it’’ legislation which  necessarily hammered future lease acquisitions. It retains but adds accountability to the tainted Royalty-In-Kind  Program that we all read about.  It improves the management of the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve with an  idea offered by my good friend from  Texas, NICKLAMPSON, by allowing a  swap for heavy crude which could immediately lower prices for consumers.  Most dramatically, our proposal will  help utilize our domestic oil and natural gas resources in the outer continental  shelf. Our  legislation  incorporates most of the offshore drilling  provision that  I and other  ‘‘Energy  Democrats’’  first  introduced  in  the  LEASE Act by directing the immediate  opening of all areas beyond 100 miles  off our coasts. That is over 300 million  acres of outer continental shelf that  are automatically open to oil and natural gas leasing. States are given the  option to opt in the additional 50 to 100  miles off their coast, an estimated 90  million acres for production.  My friends on the other side of the  aisle argue that this does not open  enough acreage in the Gulf of Mexico. I  agree. I would like to open up the eastern Gulf of Mexico. But there was an  agreement made by  the Republican  Congress in 2006 for Florida, and we are  not going to break that agreement on  the House side.  But let’s not forget the fact that during the height of the Republican rule  under both the Republican President  and Congress, Republicans were only  able to open 8.3 million acres of leasing  in the Gulf of Mexico. And President  Bush took 71⁄2years, almost 71⁄2years of  his administrations to actually decide  to take off the moratorium. So who  really wants to drill?  Over 350 million acres will be open.  This bill is hundreds of millions more  acres that are directly opened in contrast to the Senate ‘‘Gang of 20,’’ or in  the Senate Republican Leader MITCH  MCCONNELL’s bill, his Gas Price Reduction Act, which has the support of only  44 Republican senators. We open so  many more than even the Republican  leadership and the Senate wanted to,  more acreage for exploration and production.  Most importantly, we use the revenues from oil and gas production to  transition to a clean energy  future.  Our bill would create a fund to invest  in renewable, clean energy efficiency,  land  and  water  conservation  and  LIHEAP. Mr. Speaker, I could go on  and on, and I will continue as we go to  the debate. This bill is a drilling bill,  but  it’s also a  future bill  for comprehensive energy production.  ",2008

1274,33,2008-09-16,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Speaker, there is a  reason why Congress is in the 9 percent  favorable rating. We have not done the  Nation’s business.  I  look at  former  Chairman BARTONsitting in the second  row here. When we did the 2005 EPACT  bill, we had lots of amendments here  on the House floor, in fact, 23 different  Democratic amendments, some amendments to amendments. And some of  them would say at the end of the day  that it was, in fact, a bipartisan bill because Congress worked its will. And I  would say some of them were pro-energy. Frankly, some of them were anti-  energy. One offered by Ms. SOLISwas  described  as  an  amendment  that  sought to delete refinery revitalization  provisions in the bill. Thank goodness  it was defeated. The bill moved forward, and it was signed into law.  But today we have a new bill that is  hundreds of pages long. We haven’t had  a single hearing in subcommittee or  full committee. We haven’t had a single markup  in subcommittee or  full  committee. And we have a rule that  means when  it comes to the House  floor, there are no amendments allowed  at all.  The Volt is an exciting new GM vehicle that is going to be in the showroom  by 2010. It needs to be plugged in. We  need to have electricity to make  it  move.  ",2008

1279,33,2008-09-16,Mr. MARKEY.," I thank the gentlewoman.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very  simple debate. The Republicans are  very upset  that  the Democrats are  going to take the oil companies and  make them pay taxes to the American  people when they drill on the  land  owned by the American people, and the  Democrats  then want  to move  the  money over to wind and solar and plug-  in hybrids for tax breaks. So the Democrats are saying that America needs an  oil change. So, as Mr. GREEN just said,  we open up vast new areas where the  oil industry can drill, drill, drill; drill,  baby, drill.  But what we put  into the bill  is  something  else as well. We put  in  change, baby, change. Because we only  have 3 percent of the oil in the world,  we have 4 percent of the population,  and we consume 25 percent of the oil in  the world on a daily basis. That is not  a long-term recipe.  So we need an oil change. And what  we need to do and what we are going to  do is allow them to drill in thousands  and thousands of additional acres, to  go for the oil, to go drill, baby, drill,  but then say we need back some of  those tax breaks that you don’t need at  $100 a barrel, $140 a barrel, $4 a gallon  at the pump. We don’t need to subsidize  you anymore.  The  taxpayer  doesn’t need  to  be  tipped upside down and have money  shaken out of their pockets as taxpayers to hand over to the oil companies, because they have already been  tipped upside down and had money  taken out of  their pockets as consumers by the oil companies.  So we  just  take  back  those  tax  breaks, put a  little bit of a tax on  where they don’t pay any taxes at all,  and where do we shift it over to? Ladies and gentlemen, we shift it over to  wind and solar and green buildings and  plug-in hybrids. We shift it over to the  future. We unleash a technological revolution that will break our dependence  upon imported oil.  It is change, baby, change. It is innovate, baby, innovate. These guys are a  one-note organization. They have been  since two oilmen went to the White  House 8 years ago.  Drill, baby, drill is not a long-term  strategy.

1280,40,2008-09-16,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, this  debate  is nuts. The Childers amendment, among other things, would allow  stockpiling of military-style weapons  with high capacity ammunition magazines. It would undermine Federal anti-  gun trafficking laws. It would prohibit  D.C. from enacting commonsense gun  laws. It would repeal commonsense restrictions on gun possession by dangerous unqualified persons. It repeals  all age limits for the possession and  carrying of  long guns,  including assault rifles. It allows gun possession by  many persons who have committed violent  or  drug-related  misdemeanor  crimes. It allows many persons who are  dangerously mentally ill to obtain firearms. It repeals registration requirements for firearms. It repeals all safe  storage laws.  Mr. Speaker, it is my view that, if, in  fact, we enacted the Childers amendment, that we would create a situation  where we put more people in danger.  This is not about security for the  citizens of D.C. This, quite frankly, is  about  insecurity. What  this amendment is is one big fat wet kiss to the  National Rifle Association.  At this point, Mr. Speaker, I yield 5  minutes to the gentlewoman from the  District  of Columbia, ",2008
1281,40,2008-09-16,Ms. ELEANOR  HOLMESNORTON.,  ,2008
1282,40,2008-09-16,Ms. NORTON.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding. I very much appreciate  that the Rules Committee, under the  gentleman, has made the Waxman-Norton Home Rule bill in order, and particularly Chairman WAXMANfor affording a hearing which exposed the dangers of this bill, so much so that the  NRA was driven back to the drawing  board to change at least some of it. Unfortunately, they’ve left a very dangerous bill anyway.  Our Home Rule bill says 180 days  after the Heller decision, the District  must respond, and, of course, within  two weeks it had responded. Council  was about to go out of town; could have  gone out of town and waited until the  Council reconvened today, but it allowed registration to occur by passing  a stopgap measure. It didn’t change  much because there was no time for  hearings. But Heller  himself, Dick  Heller, has registered under that bill.  They  are  voting,  ironically,  as  I  speak, on a permanent bill that I think  every  Second Amendment  advocate  would support because  it more than  meets the Heller decision.  Mr. Speaker, I understand the very  painful dilemma that the Democratic  leadership and our own caucus has been  put  in. 5 days after commemorating  9/11, Democrats were met  in a dark  alley with a ‘‘do or die’’ demand from  the NRA pointing a proverbial gun at  their  re-election.  This  puts many  Democrats in a terrible position.  For  example, Speaker PELOSI and  Majority Leader HOYER have  spent  their careers protecting the Federal  presence. They have spent their careers  supporting  home  rule  and  voting  against bills just like the substitute  amendment which has been made in  order.  It  is  this  substitute  amendment  which has dismayed and, I must tell  you, even angered many in this House,  because what the rule gives with one  hand, it takes back with another.  Some people are dismayed because  they are gun safety advocates, and we  haven’t been able to get a new assault  weapon bill passed through the House.  Some people are dismayed because it  is the energy bill they want to continue to talk about and other national  business,  and  now  they’re  talking  about a local council issue.  Some are dismayed because they’ve  always supported home rule. And some  are dismayed because this is a bill that  threatens, in the worst way, the Federal presence. We’re putting not just  the District at risk. That’s par for the  course. We’re putting the entire Federal presence, every Federal official,  every dignitary, from the President of  the United States to Federal employees  working  in  cabinet  agencies,  every  man, woman and child who works, visits or lives in the District of Columbia,  is put at risk by a bill that the NRA  has insisted come to the floor.  We have before us, if this bill passes,  one of the most permissive gun laws in  the  country.  Post-9/11,  the United  States House of Representatives would  be passing a bill, should this rule survive, that arms an entirely new set of  people that most jurisdictions would  prefer not to have guns at all, children.  No age limit, for example. People just  released  from a mental  institution,  like John Hinckley, that is people who  are voluntarily committed and then released, people convicted of very serious  crimes, all could get a gun because of  the NRA bill. Why?  The Waxman-Norton bill passed 21–1  because there wasn’t any reason to  vote against  it and because people  didn’t want to be seen voting against  such a bill.  So why the substitute?  The short answer, Mr. Speaker, is because the NRA says so. It’s a short answer. It’s a long answer. It’s the only  answer. NRA has proudly announced to  every reporter in town that they wrote  the bill, that they told the Members  what to do, and that’s why the bill is  coming to the floor. They have used a  combination of campaign  funds and,  frankly, terror in the hearts of some  Democrats at least about their own re-  election. Who knows if the NRA will  succeed, but people are afraid.  The public lie that’s being pandered  here is that the NRA bill was necessary  because the District  isn’t complying  and won’t comply. Never mind that if  D.C.  didn’t  comply Congress  could  overturn District law because Congress  can  overturn  any  law  the Council  passes. But D.C. has already begun to  comply. They put in a stopgap measure. Heller is, in fact, registered. They  did that as they were going out of  town.  ",2008

1285,40,2008-09-16,Ms. NORTON.," As we’re speaking, the  Council is voting on permanent legislation that no gun supporter could oppose. It puts no limit on the number of  guns you could have in your homes. It  allows unlocked semi-automatic  firearms in the home, and it uses other  measures to protect District residents  and to protect the Federal presence,  such as restrictions, for example, on  the age when a child can get a gun.  But Members are being asked to cast  a dangerous vote on a dangerous rule,  followed by a vote on a dangerous bill  that not only has no public purpose,  but flies in the face of the overriding  public purpose of the Congress of the  United States since 9/11, and of the current administration,  to protect  the  country beginning with protecting the  Nation’s Capital.  You didn’t hear  it  from me. You  heard it from the Capitol Police if you  were at the hearing. You heard it from  the Park Police which has jurisdiction  throughout the region. You heard it.

1286,47,2008-09-16,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of the rule that will allow us to debate  and vote on Congressman CHILDERS’ amendment to H.R. 6842: legislation that will implement the Supreme Court’s historic Heller decision, and  restore and protect  the Second  Amendment rights of the residents of the District of Columbia.  This  legislation does  four  things: First,  it  overturns existing DC laws banning semiautomatic  firearms,  including  the  types of guns  most commonly used  for self defense. Second, it overturns DC laws requiring residents  to keep their firearms locked and inoperable  until the very moment they are attacked. Third,  it gives DC residents the ability to purchase a  firearm in Virginia or Maryland, a necessity because there is only one federally licensed firearms dealer in Washington, DC, and he operates without a facility that is open to the public. Fourth, this legislation removes the lengthy  and burdensome registration procedures put in  place by the DC Council.  What this legislation does not do is preclude  the DC Council in any way from passing sensible firearms regulations that comply with the  Supreme Court’s decision in Heller. The DC  Council will retain the authority to restrict firearms so long as those restrictions do not overly burden  the Second Amendment  rights of  DC residents.  It should also be noted that this legislation  does not in any way harm our efforts to stop  criminals or terrorists that pose a threat to DC  residents. Indeed, those criminals and terrorists already have access  to  illegal  firearms.  This legislation will, however, give law abiding  residents of Washington, DC, with the opportunity to purchase a legal firearm from a federally  licensed  firearms dealer and keep  it  in  their home or place of business in order to defend themselves.  I am happy to hear that the DC Council and  the Mayor have proposed changes  to DC’s  gun laws that will begin to bring the District  into compliance with the Supreme Court’s decision. However, those efforts do not preclude  us  from  acting  to  pass  Congressman  CHILDERS’ amendment. Rather, the DC Council’s proposals will  complement our efforts  here today.  In short, I urge my colleagues to adopt this  rule  today  and  to  support Mr. CHILDERS’  amendment, which will for the first time in over  30 years give  the  residents of Washington,  DC, the rights afforded to them under the Second Amendment.

1287,47,2008-09-16,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in adamant opposition to the National Capital Security & Safety Act as amended. I commend my  colleagues  Delegate  and  Representative WAXMAN on  the work  they  have done to ensure that the DC City Council  remains the leader in enacting the laws necessary  to comply with  the Supreme Court’s  decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. Unfortunately, Mr. CHILDERS’ amendment  ruins  the intent of this legislation and has dire consequences for the Nation’s capital.  I don’t agree with the Supreme Court’s decision. Regardless, I do believe that the DC City  Council is in the best position to decide what  regulations are appropriate  for  their community. Congress has trampled on the District’s  autonomy for long enough. The last thing DC  needs  is Congressional Members  to repeatedly and unnecessarily  intervene  in  issues  specific to the District of Columbia.  Equally problematic and more disturbing are  the  repercussions of Mr. CHILDERS’ amendment. His amendment throws out the DC City  Council’s emergency handgun regulations and  replaces them with so-called regulations that  in  fact endanger  their  communities’ public  safety. His amendment allows for the stockpiling of semiautomatic assault weapons, fully  loaded  firearms  in homes, and discourages  the passage of common-sense legislation addressing safe storage requirements or age limits for the possession of assault rifles.  The supporters of this amendment are not  representing the people of DC, they are representing the gun lobby. The nationwide statistics on deaths caused by intentional and accidental gunfire are extreme to begin with, but  Washington DC is rated as the thirteenth most  dangerous city in the country, where the homicide rate is almost double the national average. Are  the supporters of  this amendment  representing  the  families  in  the District who  have lost their loved ones to gun violence?

1289,82,2008-09-16,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speaker,  and my colleagues, I rise in the strongest possible opposition to this ill-conceived, if it was conceived at all, legislation.  I don’t know how many of you ever  saw the Peter Pan story, the movie, or  even read it. This is a Peter Pan story.  You know, they have the imaginary  bowls, the bowls that were not imaginary but they were empty, and they  convinced Peter Pan, Robin Williams,  to use his imagination and the bowls  will be full of food.  And this is what you’re doing today,  Mr. Chairman, and  the people  that  wrote this bill, who we do not know  who did write it. Use your imagination.  We’re going to have the oil for everything because this bill produces oil.  It produces nothing. This is a Peter  Pan story. It’s a figment of the imagination. It is a political gimmick. It is  a sham on the American people.  Shame on this House, that the courage wasn’t there for the leadership to  go on both sides of the aisle, listen to  those that have some expertise in this  problem we are facing today, the high  cost of energy, and work together and  pass an energy solution to a problem  that produces not only fossil fuels but  other  forms of  fuel, that solves the  problems for the commuter who has to  go to work. And Mr. and Mrs. Commuter, if you think this bill today that  came out of this leadership on that side  produces one bit of relief to you as you  drive to work, don’t believe it. Go see  Peter Pan. That’s all this bill is.  It has nothing in there to produce energy. In  fact,  it probably will drive  down the ability to produce energy. It  will help foreign countries.  I just heard my chairman talk about  Big Oil, how bad Big Oil is, and put the  blame on Big Oil. Where do you think  you’re getting your oil today as you  put it in your tank? From Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Chavez, foreign countries that have control of us right now.  We ought to be talking about that.  Forget talking about Big Oil, because  this body, and I’ve said it before on  this floor of the House, both sides of  the aisle have not seized the ability to  solve the energy problem by developing  fossil fuels.  Coal. There’s nothing  in  this bill  about coal to liquification or gasification. There’s nothing  in  this bill  about nuclear power. There’s nothing  in this bill that produces any energy.  In fact, this bill takes land that’s open  now and closes it, and take lands that  was closed and opens it, but it happens  to be 50 miles offshore. Any oil in between there can’t be developed.  And by the way, my good friends, if  any State contiguous to decides not to  have it drill 50 miles and out they can  say no, and they will say no because  there’s no revenue sharing in this bill.  None.  It is probably the best way to call  this bill the Venezuela, Russian, Middle East Oil Production Act, because  you’re protecting the foreign countries  under this legislation.  I don’t know why I’m getting worked  up about it because we all know this is  a political gimmick. It’s never going to  go anywhere. It’s not going to become  law. But it will give some people cover  to say, I voted for more drilling and  more production. This bill does not do  that.  It will increase energy costs. And I’m  a little concerned on both sides of the  aisle again because oil has dropped  down to $93 a barrel today. You know,  if that would have happened last year  we would have  said, my God,  the  world’s coming to an end. Oil went to  $93. But it was $145, and we are being  lulled into this type of legislation saying we’re going to solve the problem  and nothing is occurring to solve the  problems of the American consumer.  We’re right where we were last year  and the year before that, and that’s  wrong.  It does  leave out ANWR. I wasn’t  going to bring up that, but the closest,  quickest way to produce a million barrels a day to the United States was to  open ANWR. No, we left that out. Can’t  happen. A million barrels a day for the  next maybe hundred years,  for  the  American  consumer.  Every  barrel  would have gone to the United States  of America. A little provision says you  can’t export any of this oil to overseas.  We’re not exporting oil, we’re consuming it. But we’re consuming most  of our oil from overseas, paying the  foreign countries the oil prices today  because you have not come to this  floor, not one hearing  in our committee on this issue.  This bill was written  in the midnight. I shouldn’t say the midnight,  the midnight sun. I would say it was  written in the darkness of night. And  introduced last night, had the rule last  night, 500 pages. I have read it, and it  produces nothing.  You can get more energy out of this  bill, ladies and gentlemen, if you take  all the copies of the bill and put it in  a bonfire. And that is not good for this  House of this Nation. You had the opportunity.  Now, I don’t understand, really, why  anybody would support this legislation  at all because we’re committing something wrong to the American people.  We had a chance.  I  see  people  from  oil-producing  States over on that side. Why did you  buy  into the concept we wanted to  bring a bill to the floor that does nothing but say I helped develop more oil  when it doesn’t do it?  If you believe that, you would have  let us have this bill, 2 weeks, 3, 4 weeks  ago, but you didn’t because you know  when it finally gets out to the public  and they start understanding what’s  occurring, that the public will understand, yes, it was a sham.  And I’m tired of politics on oil in this  body. We have a Speaker that believes  that we have to save the planet because we can’t burn any more fossil  fuel. If that’s the case, then let’s admit  it. I believe this is what she believes,  and I think that’s sad.  I believe we ought to say, okay, we  do have to have fossil fuels and we can  develop the other forms of energy but  it takes time. We need that bridge.  This bill doesn’t do that.  So we’re going to come back here  next year, the public will be hoodwinked. The  public will have high  prices again, nothing will be done.  If we’re really wise, we’d take this  bill today, totally defeat  it, send  it  back and work across the aisle for the  American people, work across the aisle  for solutions that would no longer have  the yoke not of Big Oil around our  necks, the yoke of the foreign countries that took those billions of dollars.  The  largest  transfer  of  American  wealth in history occurred because this  body didn’t act correctly and did not  develop the resources so we wouldn’t  have to transfer that wealth overseas,  and we did it.  So we have a responsibility to defeat  this legislation. It was conceived in the  dark. Who the father is, I do not know.  But we do know it’s not legitimate.  I reserve the balance of my time.

1293,89,2008-09-16,Mr. DEFAZIO.,"  I  thank  the  tleman.  The oil and gas industry contributed  $166 million to the Republicans since  1990, 75 percent of their political contributions. Fact: When President Bush  took office, gas cost $1.47 a gallon.  Today gas costs $3.79 a gallon in my  district. Fact: In 2002, the oil companies made $30 billion in profits. In 2008,  it’s projected they will make an unbelievable record $160 billion in profits,  every penny of that extracted  from  American  consumers  and American  small businesses and borrowed  from  overseas, putting us in huge trouble.  The oil companies took care of their  Republican  cronies  and  the Republicans legislated on their behalf. When  they controlled everything, the House,  the White House and the Senate, they  passed the so-called energy bill. It took  them 5 years to write  it. And they  passed it. We’re living with the consequences, which is the huge increase  in profits and the huge  increase  in  prices to consumers.  The choice is clear. Do we pass a bill  written by Democrats who are not beholden to Big Oil, or do we pass another Republican bill, those who legislated this mess in the first place? Do  we break our dependence on fossil fuels  and mandate renewal energy, or do we  ignore the ravages of global warming,  drill, dig, burn and borrow our Nation  to debt and dust?  Today I will vote for energy independence, sustainability and affordable  energy prices. Many of my Republican  colleagues will vote yet again for bigger oil company profits. Congratulations  to  the Grand Old Oil Party.  They’re very consistent.  ",2008

1295,89,2008-09-16,Mr. LAMBORN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today as my colleagues across the aisle  try to deceive the American people  with this none-of-the-above, no energy  plan. H.R. 6899, the Democrat energy  bill, does nothing to address lawsuits  from radical environmentalists, which  means that leases will be tied up in  court for years. It allows no drilling  within 50 miles of American shores.  This alone rules out most of the promising areas in the Gulf of Mexico. It  gives no revenue sharing to States that  allow offshore drilling. This bill would  actually  cost  these  States money.  States will have no incentive to allow  drilling from 50 to 100 miles. It imposes  tax increases on oil companies right  when they need to invest in new development. These tax hikes will be passed  on to consumers and will raise the  price of gasoline and home heating oil.  It does nothing to promote oil shale,  nuclear power, clean coal, new refineries or Alaskan oil.  I am concerned about using oil shale  in particular, being from Colorado. According to estimates, there are 1.23  trillion barrels of oil in oil shale deposits  just  in government-owned  lands.  This legislation does not provide a solution that advances oil shale development. It is estimated that access to  this American supply of energy could  supply American  domestic  gasoline  needs for 200 years.  In essence, the Democrat bill does  not open up offshore drilling as it purports to do. It makes no progress on  other major sources of energy. And it  actually raises the cost of oil and gas  through tax hikes and raises the cost  of electricity through its renewable energy standards. This bill is not just a  sham and a fraud, though it is that. It  will actually damage our economy. It  will kill jobs, and it threatens our economic future as a country.  ",2008
1296,89,2008-09-16,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, just to  remind  the  previous  gentleman, he  ought to read the bill because there is  a State opt-in for oil shale leasing, including in his own State.  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. ALTMIRE) who  has been a real stalwart in helping us  develop this comprehensive energy bill.  ",2008
1297,89,2008-09-16,Mr. ALTMIRE.," My  friends on the  other side of the aisle, those who stood  in this darkened House Chamber for  weeks asking Congress to return to  vote on a drilling bill, will bemoan the  fact that this bill is not identical to  their bill, but no one in this House, Republican or Democrat, got everything  in this bill that they wanted. Every  one of us could  find  something we  would like to take out, something that  was left out that we would like to put  in, or language that we would like to  change. But that is how the legislative  process works. The finished product is  a result of give-and-take compromise  put together in a way that can pass by  majority vote. That is what we’re here  for, right? To pass an energy bill.  But the truth is, Mr. Speaker, those  on the other side have been a part of  this process. For months, we’ve heard  their cries of ‘‘drill here, drill now.’’  For months they have talked of nothing else. So here we are today taking  up a bill that triples the territory that  is available for offshore drilling. And  during the 6 years the Republicans held  control of both Congress and the White  House, they had the chance to write  the bill exactly as they wanted. And  during those 6 years, they did nothing  to reduce our dependence on foreign oil  and nothing to advance their  ‘‘drill,  baby, drill’’ war chant. For 6 years the  American people watched and waited  for  the Republicans  to act but got  nothing in return.  So now it’s our turn, and today we  will pass a bill to expand offshore drilling. So to my Republican colleagues, I  say their voices have been heard. Their  views have been  included. And they  should take ‘‘yes’’ for an answer.  ",2008

1299,89,2008-09-16,Mr. SHADEGG.,"  I  thank  the gentleman. My colleague on the other side  just said nobody got everything they  wanted out of this bill. The reality is  nobody gets anything out of this bill.  Nobody gets anything of out of this bill  except the environmental groups who  will sue to block all oil production. The  reality is we are legislating to solve a  crisis that we created. It was the Congress at the urging of environmental  groups that blocked Outer Continental  Shelf drilling. It was the Congress that  blocked drilling in the Inter-Mountain  West. It was the Congress that blocked  drilling in Alaska.  Do you know what that has done?  That has cost Americans jobs. That has  cost the people  in my district their  chance to earn a livelihood because we  locked that all up. Are we opening it  up today? Is my colleague right that  this is a compromise? Absolutely not.  We are not opening up one  single  square inch of drilling. Let me make it  clear. The Sierra Club said  ‘‘we are  working very hard on this bill to ensure that its focus is not expanded offshore drilling.’’ Mr. MURTHA, a close  friend of Speaker PELOSI, said, he admitted that, this is a political month.  Last Wednesday, he said that there are  all kinds of things we are going to try  to do that will go away after we leave.  They don’t plan to produce oil under  this bill. It’s just talk. The legislative  director of  the  radical Natural Resources Defense Council acknowledged  the same thing about the Democrats’  ploy: ‘‘This is about politics, not necessarily  about  policy.’’  Democrats  know that not a drop of oil will be produced because  lawyers will  file  lawsuits stopping every single one. Let me  make the point: The administration  last year  issued  487  leases  in  the  Chukchi Sea. Environmental  groups  sued to stop and have stopped all 487.  The administration has a total of 748  leases in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort  Sea. How many  lawsuits have been  filed and how many leases have been  challenged in lawsuits? All 748.

1301,103,2008-09-16,Mr. KING of Iowa.," I thank the gentleman from New Mexico for yielding.  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, I  think it’s named exactly what it is.  Why, at a time when we have hurricanes that have hit the gulf coast,  that’s a time we might want to have to  tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. When we’ve got Putin sitting  over in Georgia, Ahmadinejad threatening to close the Straits of Hormuz  and we’re opening up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for what, for political  strategy? Not for strategy for the security of the United States of America.  That defies logic, I would say.  And to swap out sweet Texas crude  for heavy Venezuelan oil at the same  time also defies logic to track this.  Why would anybody come to the floor  and defend opening up the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve?  But, Mr. Speaker, I came here to address this overall energy piece. And  first, I’m for all-American energy all  the time. I want to open up all of it.  And I’m also for an open process, not  for a 290-page bill that hit the presses  last night at 10 o’clock and the Rules  Committee at 10:45. How in the world  could they evaluate it? And furthermore, what’s the purpose of this constitutional process if there is no subcommittee, no committee, no amendments allowed anywhere along the line,  amendments denied at the Rules Committee as well, a closed process—yes,  an open debate for 3 hours, but not a  process that allows perfection?  So it seems to me that we’ve handed  the  entire authority of  the United  States Congress over to the Speaker  from San Francisco, who writes a policy, 290 pages, that doesn’t do anything  for us.  And I would add, Mr. Speaker, that  even the Outer Continental Shelf, if we  do nothing,  it opens up. If this bill  passes and becomes law, then it blocks  out the first 50 miles, and litigation  blocks that out and all of the rest.  I have here a copy of the Federal  Code. This is the legislation that ended  litigation on the North Slope of Alaska  in 1973. That’s what it took. No one got  through the environmental litigation;  it was an act of Congress. If we don’t  have an act of Congress, we’re not  going to get through this litigation,  and all of our energy is going to be  locked up, Mr. Speaker.  So this bill does nothing for corn ethanol, coal, ANWR, nuclear, the first 50  miles, oil shale, natural gas, hydroelectric, or the litigation that’s blocking it.  b2000  ",2008

1303,103,2008-09-16,Mr. ETHERIDGE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  tonight in support of H.R. 6899, a comprehensive plan to use our Nation’s resources and Americans’ know-how to  reduce prices and to free our Nation  from the grips of foreign oil.  This legislation invests in renewable  energy sources such as cellulosic ethanol, biomass and soybean diesel, creating good-paying jobs here at home  and growing our rural economies. This  legislation has opened up the Outer  Continental Shelf. It has renewed drilling while demanding that oil companies use the leases they already have  that have been issued or lose the leases  to other oil companies that will actually produce oil and gas. It is time to  end the giveaway to big oil companies  that are reaping record profits while  my folks in North Carolina and their  families are struggling to afford to fill  their own gas tanks. Today’s bill does  just that.  This legislation puts our Nation on a  path toward a sustainable energy future through greater energy efficiency  and conservation. This  legislation  is  for the people of North Carolina and for  America who would rather grow their  own fuel instead of sending billions of  dollars to the Middle East.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  vote in favor of this progressive, futuristic piece of legislation to free America.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  tonight  in support of  6899,  the Comprehensive American Energy  Security and Consumer Protection Act.  H.R. 6899 will increase American oil production, invest in renewable energy sources and  new efficiency technology, end giveaways to  big oil companies, and create  jobs here at  home. This  legislation puts our Nation on a  path  toward energy  independence  through  greater energy efficiency and conservation,  and lowers the price average Americans consumers pay for the energy they need.  For too long, this administration and the Republicans in Congress have relied on a single  approach to our Nation’s energy policy, allowing big oil companies  to decide when and  where to drill, while failing to ensure that they  pay their fair share to the American people for  the use of our federal lands. For too long the  major oil companies have enjoyed the highest  profits ever recorded at  the expense of  the  American consumer, all while utilizing only a  fraction of the Federal land available to them  for drilling. This has only served to increase  our reliance on foreign oil.  The bill Democrats are proposing today represents a change in the direction for our Nation’s energy policy. H.R 6899 puts our Nation  on a path  towards a sustainable renewable  energy future by eliminating unnecessary tax  breaks to oil companies and using these funds  for research into alternative fuels and renewable energy and efficiency tax incentives. We  can put American know-how to work, strengthening our economy and creating good-paying  jobs here at home instead of $700 billion each  year to the Middle East. We can use the resources of rural America to grow energy right  here at home and strengthen our communities.  Finally Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6899 has shown  that the Democratic Congress has listened to  the American people and not the big oil companies. This is comprehensive legislation that  includes a compromise  that will  responsibly  open  the Outer Continental Shelf, OCS,  for  drilling, while demanding  that oil companies  use the leases they have already been issued  or lose these leases to oil companies that actually want to produce oil.  This legislation gives States the authority to  allow drilling  from 50  to 100 miles offshore  and makes all OCS waters beyond 100 miles  immediately available for oil exploration. This  puts our resources to work to meet our Nation’s needs while at the same time protecting  our coasts.  I know how high energy prices are hurting  American  families. This bill makes  important  changes to improve our energy supply and reduce costs. This is a bill that we can all support on behalf of the American people. I urge  my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 6899.  ",2008

First, I have to question again  the use of the term ‘‘compromise.’’ The  use of the term ‘‘compromise’’ implies  that the minority party was consulted,  our advice was sought, that we could  channel the wishes and aspirations and  voices of our people into this debate as  the legislation moves forward. We were  denied  that opportunity. Perhaps  it  would be best to clarify that this is a  compromise amongst the Democratic  Party itself and not amongst the majority and minority parties.  Secondly, this bill continues to ration energy. This is a government rationing of energy, and at this point in  time when America needs energy production, it will not meet the needs of  people who are suffering.  ",2008

I have spoken  at length on the policy, or lack thereof.  I thought it was ironic that we had  Congressman ABERCROMBIE and Congressman PETERSONon the floor earlier  speaking about their efforts to come up  with a bipartisan compromise bill. I  think they made a noble effort.  I went to JOHNDINGELL, the chairman of the Energy Committee, and  asked if he would like to work with me  on the Energy and Commerce section  of the bill; and he said that, quite  frankly, he wasn’t able to do that.  I just asked DONYOUNGif he was ever  asked by Mr. RAHALLto work on a bill  in his committee, and Mr. YOUNGsaid  that never happened.  My guess  is  that  if  I asked JIM  MCCRERY, the ranking member of the  Ways and Means Committee, if he was  asked by Mr. RANGEL, the chairman,  that Mr. MCCRERYwould also say that  he was never asked.  The point of fact is we have a 290-  page bill that is being voted on the day  after the evening  it was  introduced.  There is no way you can have a substantive vetting, debate on this massive amount of legislation in less than  a 24-hour period. And none of the relevant committees on a bipartisan basis  have held a markup, have held a hearing, any kind of a legislative drafting  session at all. And yet we are asking  the 435 Members of this body and the  delegates that are allowed to vote on  the floor to vote on the most important domestic public policy issue before this Congress.  That is not fair to the American people. It is a disservice to the process;  and  for  that  reason alone,  the bill  should be voted down.  ",2008

1312,110,2008-09-16,Mr. PEARCE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 11⁄2minutes.  Mr. Speaker, this debate has progressed for a long time, but made a  very short distance. The American people have a right to expect that we  would do our job, that we would do our  job to ease the pain in their everyday  life. They have a right to expect that  we would increase the competitiveness  of American companies so that we are  able to hold a good, strong economy.  They have a right to expect that we  would give fairness to all States. They  have a right to expect that we would  use good common sense in establishing  this bill.  Mr. Speaker, we are failing on every  account in the bill that is before us tonight. When we should be establishing  American dominance  in  the  energy  field, we are saying  ‘‘no’’ to nuclear  and ‘‘yes’’ to bicycle power. When we  should be doing our job to find new  clean coal technologies, we don’t even  mention them here. When we should be  drilling for every amount of oil that we  can find here to create American jobs  and to stop spending $700 billion overseas, we are  limiting our ability to  produce here.  We were told 2 years ago that we  were going to see a plan, and tonight  we were told we have new ideas. Those  new ideas are riding bicycles and killing the American economy with higher  fuel prices, hurting the American family with continued restrictions of supplies, putting ourselves strategically at  risk by selling off the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  Mr. Speaker, I request that all Members, Republican and Democrat, vote  ‘‘nay’’ on the bill in front of us tonight.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BOEHNER).  ",2008
1313,110,2008-09-16,Mr. BOEHNER.," Let me thank my  colleague for yielding. Let’s just stop  and think for a moment about what  our constituents are dealing with tonight as we stand here. They have got  concerns about the economy, concerns  about keeping their own  jobs. They  have concerns about whether they are  going to be able to put gas in their car  tomorrow considering the high price of  gas. Or we have the home heating crisis  about to come to us as they are filling  their propane tanks and oil tanks and  looking at the heating bills that are  coming this winter.  And what are we doing? We are sitting here tonight in the middle of the  biggest hoax I have seen in the 18 years  I have been in Congress. It is a sham,  and everybody in this Chamber knows  it is a sham. I know those are strong  words and words that I don’t use lightly, but I want my colleagues to consider this for a moment.  We have a bill here that purports to  be a compromise, but I don’t know one  Republican Member who was involved  in one meeting with regard to this  compromise.  It was written by  the  Democrat  leadership  that  runs  this  Congress in the dark of night on a napkin. It showed up here last night at  9:45, a 290-page bill at 9:45 last night  that no Member had ever seen; and  guess what, as we stand here tonight,  no Member has read.  All right, some Member, any Member  stand up and tell me you have read this  bill. That is what I suspected. Not one  Member has read the bill that we are  about to consider. No hearings on the  bill, no committee action, no one has  read, and the bill purports, purports to  increase American energy. But I want  you to consider this: 85 percent of the  known reserves off of our coast on the  Outer Continental Shelf, 85 percent at  a minimum are locked up permanently  under this bill. And of the 15 percent  that are purportedly opened, the States  would have to comply to open those  Outer Continental Shelf reserves. But  there  is no  revenue  sharing  to  the  States like there is in Texas and Louisiana and Mississippi and other areas.  There  is no revenue sharing, so the  States have no incentive to want to  open up the Outer Continental Shelf.  So how much new drilling will we get  out of this bill? Zero. It is just zero.  And there isn’t a Member in this body  who doesn’t know it is zero. So when I  call it a hoax or a sham, I think you all  understand what I am trying to say.  No new nuclear plants in this bill, no  new oil shale drilling in this bill. No  clean-coal technology in this bill. We  are the Saudi Arabia of the world when  it comes to coal. We have clean-coal  technology. Whether it is coal to gas,  coal to liquid, we have ways to use our  coal in a clean way. Nothing in this bill  will allow it to happen.  What does it have in it? It has a big  old tax increase in it; you can be sure  of that.  What else does it have in it? It has a  big earmark in it: $1.2 billion for the  City of New York on behalf of one  Member in this bill. Here we are trying  to take some steps toward energy security, and we have to load it up with a  big old earmark, $1.2 billion.  A compromise, huh? This is no compromise. The compromise might have  been amongst a bunch of Democrat  chairmen who wanted to have some  bill, but there is no compromise here.  Let’s just describe this bill for what  it really is. It is nothing more than political cover on the eve of an election  to say that we voted for an energy bill,  except there is no energy in it.  Congressional approval today  is at  the lowest point in any time since polling began, and our Members wonder  why.  b2100  And it’s stunts like this that have  the American people so cynical about  their Congress. They expect that the  Congress  is going  to do  something  about increasing energy security in our  country; that we’re going to do something about bringing down the high  cost of gasoline; that we’re going to do  something about bringing down  the  high cost of heating oil or propane or  natural gas this winter.  And what are we doing?  Playing political games on the eve of  an election.

1314,117,2008-09-16,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, there is no denying  that America is suffering from an energy crisis.  My constituents are paying record prices at  the pump,  they are paying higher prices  for  food and commodities. This problem  is only  going to get worse this winter when they will  be paying 15 percent more  to heat  their  homes than last year. With family budgets already being stretched  to  the breaking point,  Congress needs to act and to act quickly to  address  this problem. This will require both  long term solutions that decrease our reliance  on  fossil  fuels and  imported  fuels and short  term solutions which will help bring down the  price of energy now.  I have heard from a number of my constituents that a proven way to address both our  short term and long term energy costs is to  renew the renewable energy tax credit and the  production tax credit that are due to expire at  the end of this year. We already know how effective  these  tax credits are. For example,  wind energy is not only a significant component of the global warming solution, but also  a powerful engine in our economy. Since January 2007, more than 40 wind industry manufacturing  facilities  have  been  announced,  brought online, or expanded in the U.S., creating over 9,000 jobs and one billion in new  manufacturing investment. When the production tax credit lapsed in 2000, 2002 and 2004,  wind capacity installation dropped 93 percent,  73 percent and 77 percent, respectively, from  the previous year.  It  is unwise  to allow  the  wind production tax credit to expire and allow  this bright spot in our economy to grind to a  halt.  The solar energy production tax credit and  the solar residential tax credit have been instrumental in helping my home state of New  Jersey become a leader in the production of  solar energy technology. New Jersey is also  one of the nation’s fastest growing solar energy markets. The extension of the solar energy tax credit will spur job growth in communities and would help New Jersey reach  its  goal of having 20 percent of its electricity derived  from  renewable sources by  the year  2020. I have heard from companies in my district that if we don’t extend the production tax  credit they will have to shut down new solar  projects or charge more for energy.  The  tax credit  for consumers has been  equally effective  in saving our constituents  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:27 Sep 17, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00117 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A16SE7.063 H16SEPT1 E S U O H h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l e b j         ",2008

1317,124,2008-09-16,Mr.  PETERSON  of  Pennsylvania.,"  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I want to thank the leadership on  both sides. I want to thank all of the  Members for the opportunity tonight  to offer America the first bipartisan  energy bill that may have been offered  in this century written by Republicans  and Democrats in a room with just cold  sandwiches night after night, working  with no lobbyists, no power brokers,  trying to come together like the American people want us to. They want affordable, available energy as soon as  we  can  get  it,  and  they want  it  ongoingly, and they deserve it.  We’re the most powerful Nation in  the world, and it’s unfair to the American public that their future depends  on weather in the gulf, that their future  depends  on unstable  countries  that provide us half of our imported  oil. We get half of the 70 percent we import from friends and half of it from  unstable nations. The American people  are not comfortable with that. They  want better.  And the American people know that  our energy system could be sabotaged  each and every day by the terrorists  because there is no slop in the system,  there’s no surplus, there’s no extra.  There’s just enough oil to meet the oil  demand each day, and whenever anything goes wrong, the prices skyrocket.  Folks, we have the chance here to reevaluate  our  policies.  I understand  many years ago when we set it aside, it  was cheap: $2 gas, $10 oil, use theirs,  save ours. Folks, that day is gone. We  need to now reassess where we’re at.  We need to be energy independent in  this country, and we need  to  start  down that long road. It won’t be easy,  and it needs to be a broad-based plan.  Our bill opens up the Outer Continental Shelf. It takes away all the prohibitions that have been put upon the  Department of the Interior for leasing  land. It repeals the prohibition of preventing Federal agencies from entering  into contracts for procurement of alternative and synthetic  fuels. It repeals limitation on the number of new  qualified hybrid and advanced clean-  burn technology vehicles eligible  for  the alternative vehicle tax benefits.  That’s electric and gas cars.  It allows the use of woody biomass,  the fastest growing renewable we have  that’s  fueling pellet stoves and  factories with wood waste and will be part  of cellulosic ethanol as we move from  corn to cellulose, prohibited today by  law  from using off of Federal  land,  wood waste. Removes that.  Folks, it removes the prohibition on  shale oil, the biggest oil opportunity  this country has ever had. And folks, it  takes the revenues and funds the renewables better than they’ve ever been  funded.  It  funds conservation better  than  it’s ever been  funded. It  funds  clean-up efforts, environmental clean-  up efforts. It funds carbon sequestration with large amounts of money.  And let me read you that paragraph  which I think is vital:  ‘‘The Carbon  Capture and Sequestration Reserve offsets  the cost of  legislation enacted  after the date of the enactment of the  National Conservation, Environment  and Energy Independence Act to promote  research  and  development  projects associated with carbon capture and storage in the production of  liquid transportation fuels, electricity,  synthetic natural gas, chemical feedstock and for the disposition and recycling/reprocessing  of  nuclear waste  from nuclear power plants.’’  It will fund LIHEAP for those who  are not going to be able to afford their  heating this winter.

I want the record to show because I  have great respect for the chairman of  the Government Reform Committee,  but the fact is I had talked to the minority staff about my concerns with  some of the language of this bill because I believe it has factual mistakes  in it that suggests that actually handguns endanger people rather than protect people.  But I talked to the chairman and to  the ranking member, and the hearing  that we had had been agreed to by both  sides and we went through the process.  You specifically told me you will get  your vote on the floor and let’s not  have a fight in committee, so I didn’t  offer a series of amendments.

But what I said was I had  a series of amendments, and in discussion with the majority and the minority,  I’m not objecting that  I didn’t  have the right to do it; I certainly had  the right to do it. What I am objecting  to is we had a process that both sides  had roughly agreed that we weren’t  going to challenge the underlying bill.  We keep hearing that the underlying  bill passed unanimously.  It did not  have unanimous support in the committee. If we would have had a forced  vote, we would have polarized on this,  as we would have on the bill.  We have moved the bill forward, and  that was my point.

1325,131,2008-09-16,Mr. CHILDERS.,"  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Connecticut (Mr. SHAYS), a senior  member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.  ",2008
1326,131,2008-09-16,Mr. SHAYS.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding, and I don’t intend to take  3 minutes, but I do want to weigh in.  In 1993 or 1994, the assault weapon  ban passed the House by one vote, and  it resulted in the defeat of a number of  powerful Democrats and may have resulted, in fact, in the Republican Party  gaining the majority. This is not an  easy vote for Members to take, and I  had some Members suggest I won’t be  the next chairman or ranking member  of the Committee on Government Reform if I step up and speak in favor of  something I believe in. Obviously that  is not a sensible thing to tell any Member.  The bottom line for me is this: I believe that people have a constitutional  right to bear arms and the government  has a constitutional responsibility to  regulate that right. That’s what I believe. I believe it has to conform to the  Constitution of the United States.  I believe the Supreme Court has declared what the District of Columbia  has  outlined  in  banning  handguns.  They declared  it as unconstitutional  and they said come back with a law  that is constitutional. It seems very  reasonable to me that we would give  the District of Columbia an opportunity to comply with the ruling of the  Supreme Court without our bringing  our own particular views to this issue.  During that debate I was  in good  company. Leading the debate for the  Republicans on the assault weapon ban  was Henry Hyde, a revered Member of  this House. So there are obviously differences of agreements on what we  should do. But what we should do is  speak our mind as we see it and obviously live with the results of that as it  impacts individuals.  People have a constitutional right to  bear arms. The government has a constitutional responsibility to regulate  that right. The District of Columbians  are Americans. They don’t have a full-  fledged Member of Congress, though I  would say Ms. NORTON is full-fledged  with me but she does not have all of  the powers she deserves. I hope some  day she has those powers.  I agree with  the majority  leader  when he  said you can’t  favor Federalism for only the ideas you like. The  bottom line for me, in the spirit of  Henry Hyde, I believe that the District  of Columbia should have the right to  make this decision and abide by the  Constitution of the United States.

1329,131,2008-09-16,Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota.," Mr.  Chairman, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 6842, the National Capital Security and Safety Act. It is a commonsense bill. This bill puts the District of  Columbia on notice that it must comply with the Supreme Court’s decision  and directs the men and women elected  by the citizens of our Nation’s capital,  along with the District’s law enforcement officers, who put their lives on  the line every day to do their jobs and  to determine how best to comply with  the Court.  Capital Police Chief Morse and D.C.  Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier  testified before our committee,  and I trust them when they express  their grave concerns about more guns,  more powerful guns on D.C. streets.  But rather than listen to Chief Lanier  and Chief Morse, there will be a substitute amendment offered on behalf of  the National Rifle Association with  complete disregard for the American  families that live in Washington, D.C.  The  substitute  amendment would  allow for more guns designated solely  to kill people on D.C. streets and surely result in more money in the pockets  of gun profiteers and the possibility of  more fund-raising dollars for pro-gun  candidates.  To all the brave hunters on the floor  tonight fighting to protect the rights  of hunters, there are no bucks, bears or  boars to shoot on the streets of D.C.,  but there are innocent children, women  and men who will be shot as they are  caught in the crossfire in a city loaded  with guns designed to kill.  In our Nation’s capital with all of the  homeland  security  considerations,  I  simply cannot understand why we deny  elected local officials from taking commonsense measures to comply with the  court and at the same time ensure the  safety of our residents, our dignitaries,  and our guests.  Mr. Chairman, we talk a great deal  about listening to military leaders on  the ground in Iraq. Why aren’t we taking our own advice and listening to our  law enforcement leaders on the streets  of D.C.?  As a supporter of the second amendment to the Constitution, I stand with  law enforcement  for safety, security  and sensible gun laws. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6842 and reject  the NRA’s amendment that would facilitate the senseless proliferation of  weapons of human destruction in our  Nation’s capital.  ",2008

1334,138,2008-09-16,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  to salute the offerer of the amendment.  The gentleman  from Mississippi has  shown extraordinary leadership, courage, and ability, and the body owes him  a thanks for his efforts in this matter.  I also rise to thank the leadership for  putting this legislation on the floor.  The amendment offered by the gentleman from Mississippi is a commonsense, bipartisan proposal that will implement the historic Heller decision  enacted by the Supreme Court, and it  will restore and protect second amendment rights of the residents of the District of Columbia and elsewhere.  The Congress acts tonight under its  plenary power over the District of Columbia, and one of its actions tonight  are to assure the protections of the second amendment of the Constitution.  We’ve heard much falsehood and misunderstanding pronounced in the press  and tonight  in the discussion about  what it is going to do. The Supreme  Court found that the District of Columbia’s ban on handguns was a violation  of the second amendment, and it based  that finding on a decision that the second amendment grants each individual  the right to own a firearm for self-defense.  Like a majority of the Members of  this body, I supported the decision, and  I pointed out that the Court’s ruling  provided  important  guidance  that  would allow local governments to craft  sensible, responsible measures designed  to keep firearms out of the hands of  criminals, the mentally ill, and those  who pose a threat to the public safety.  That remains the truth today and tonight. The D.C. council reacted to this  historical ruling not by enacting sensible regulations but, instead, passed  emergency  legislation that continues  to bar law-abiding citizens, residents of  the District of Columbia, from meaningful access to the firearms within the  second amendment.  I’m happy to hear that the D.C. council and the mayor have now proposed  changes to D.C. gun  laws that will  begin to bring the District into compliance with the Supreme Court decision.  I commend them for it. It came, regrettably, too late. These efforts do not,  however, preclude us from acting upon  the amendment offered by the distinguished gentleman  from Mississippi,  and again, I commend him for his leadership in this matter.  When the D.C. council’s proposals, if  they are carried forward as they say  they  intend to, are there, they, together with the legislation that we are  enacting  tonight with  the Childers  amendment, will protect the rights of  the citizens of the District of Columbia  under the second amendment, but they  also will assure that the District of Columbia has the reasonable power to  control improper use of firearms.  The legislation only does four things.  First, it overturns existing D.C. gun  laws banning semi-automatic weapons,  including the types of guns most commonly used for self-defense, something  which the Supreme Court said was protected by the second amendment.  Secondly, it overturns D.C. law requiring residents to keep their firearms  locked and inoperable until the very  moment that they are attacked. What  a silly proposal, a proposal that requires a person to rush to the cabinet  to unlock it, to get a firearm, to load  it, so that they can protect themselves  CHILDERS’  b2345  And he operates without a facility  that is open to the public.  Fourth,  the  legislation  removes  lengthy and burdensome registration  procedures malevolently put in place  by the D.C. City Council to ensure that  citizens would not be able to access  firearms in a lawful, legal, and proper  fashion.  This legislation does not preclude the  Council from in any way enacting sensible firearms regulations that comply  with the Supreme Court’s decision in  Heller. The D.C. Council will retain authority to restrict firearms so long as  those restrictions do not  improperly  burden the second amendment rights of  D.C. residents.  Some of the opponents of Congressman  amendment  have  claimed that this legislation will lead  to more guns ending up in the hands of  criminals  or  even  terrorists. What  hooey. The only people in D.C. that can  own a firearm for almost all intents  and purposes are criminals. Law-abiding citizens have enormous burdens in  achieving ownership of a firearm. And  so we have, in the District of Columbia,  a well-armed group of thugs armed to  the  teeth, preying upon  law-abiding  citizens at their whim with firearms  which they may have.  The CHAIRMAN.

1340,152,2008-09-16,Ms. CANTWELL.," Mr. President, as I  rise to speak this morning, for the first  time since April 1, the price of oil has  fallen to below $100 a barrel, and that  is certainly a welcome relief to many  Americans across this country and to  businesses who have been devastated  by high energy markets.  We shouldn’t underestimate the damage that has been caused. Just this  past Friday,  in my home State of  Washington, Alaska Air  announced  that more than 1,000 people will lose  their jobs because of high fuel prices  and a slowing economy. Compared to  last year, Americans have paid $76 billion more for gasoline in 2008, and I  know many people went without vacations, and businesses have cut back on  their operations.  Now, we  have  had  various  independent reports that have shown that  the fluctuation in price from 2007 to  2008 cannot be explained by simple supply-and-demand fundamentals. And we  are having a hearing at 2:30 this afternoon in the Energy Committee about  excessive speculation and how prices  were driven to record highs this summer. But what we need to also realize  is the scrutiny Congress has placed on  Wall Street along with the promise to  have stricter oversight has had an impact; prompting a large volume of capital starting to leave these markets.  It wasn’t that long ago when President George Bush was picked up on the  Internet at a reception saying  ‘‘Wall  Street got drunk.’’ Now, I don’t know if  the President really meant to have this  publicly captured on the Internet, but  it was, and I know afterwards his Press  Secretary was quoted as saying:  Well, you know, I actually haven’t spoken  to him about this, but I imagine what he  meant, as I have heard him describe it before  in both public and private, was that Wall  Street let themselves get carried away and  that they did not understand the risks these  newfangled financial instruments would pose  to the markets.  And while it is Wall Street that has  gotten drunk, it is the American public  paying for the hangover.  Today, we are struggling to contain  one of the most severe credit crises  since the Great Depression, and American families are going to pay dearly  for that lack of oversight and regulatory indifference to what have been  critical markets for us to oversee. I  give credit to Secretary Paulson for his  swift action over the  last couple of  weeks to contain the economic fallout  from a reeling Wall Street.  During the past decade, the agencies  charged with financial oversight have  turned their eye from what has been  one of the worst excesses our country  has  seen. My question  for my colleagues today is, when are we going to  learn the lessons of history and make  sure Congress does its job in the oversight of  the  regulatory agencies  so  they do theirs?  In many ways, today’s super-bubbles  are a repeat of the 1920s when too much  borrowing  to  underwrite  too many  speculative bets using  too much of  other people’s money set up the entire  economy for a crash. In 1999, Congress  repealed  key  parts  of  the  Glass-  Steagall Act of 1933. The repeal allowed  banks to operate any kind of financial  businesses they desired, and it set up a  situation where the banks had multiple  conflicts of interest.  Several  economists  and  analysts  have cited the repeal of this act as a  major contributor to the 2007 subprime  mortgage crisis.  In  fact, Robert Kuttner, cofounder  and co-editor of the American Prospect  magazine wrote in September 2007:  Hedge funds, private equity companies, and  the subprime mortgage industries have two  big things in common. First, each represents  financial middlemen unproductively extracting wealth from the real economy. Second,  each exploits loopholes in what remains a financial regulation.  But we didn’t end our deregulation  there.  In 2000 we also deregulated a new and  volatile financial derivative that is at  the heart of today’s housing credit crisis—credit default swaps.  As White House press secretary Dana  Perino described it earlier this year,  these  ‘‘newfangled  financial  instruments’’ that posed a risk to the market  actually grew into a $62 trillion industry.  Warren Buffett has called these credit-swaps ‘‘financial weapons of mass destruction.’’  The proliferation of these newfangled  financial instruments has resulted in  huge profits and  losses without any  physical goods changing hands.  I come to the floor asking my colleagues: when are we going to learn the  lessons of the past?  When are we going to realize that the  1929 stock market crash has the same  root cause as the recent housing bubble?  Both were financed by dangerously  high  leveraged borrowing. And after  the crash many banks failed—causing a  ripple effect that devastated our Nation’s economy.  After  the  1929  crash,  Congress  stepped up and changed the banking  laws to eliminate some of the abuses  that had paved the way for economic  disaster.  My question is—we acted after the  crisis and Congress did step up and do  something. What I want to know  is  whether we have learned our lesson.  Are we going to  legislate consumer  protections in advance, or only after a  bubble bursts?  The savings and loan crisis of the  1980s and 1990s when 747 savings and  loan associations went under provides  a similar lesson.  Like before, much of this mess can be  traced back to the deregulation of the  savings and loans which gave these associations many of the capabilities of  banks, but failed to bring them under  the same regulations.  Congress eliminated regulations designed to prevent lending excesses and  minimize failures.  Deregulation allowed lending in distant loan markets on the promise of  higher returns, and it also allowed associations to participate in speculative  construction activities with builders  and developers who had little or no financial stake in the projects.  The ultimate cost of this crisis is estimated to have totaled around $160  billion, with U.S. taxpayers bailing out  the institutions to the tune of $125 billion. This, of course, added to our deficit of the early 1990s.  I ask my colleagues: When are we  going to learn this lesson?  We have failed to see that oversight  and transparency are always critical  parts of any functioning market.  We have failed to see that when Congress makes reforms, like the Commodities Futures Modernization Act  in  2000, or like the repeal of key portions  of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, or the  deregulation of the energy markets in  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:10 Mar 19, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€8SENATE\S16SE8.REC S16SE8 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2008

1342,159,2008-09-16,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President,  I  ask the Chair to notify me when I have  reached the 1-minute mark.  Mr. President, I first want to say, as  I rise to support the National Defense  Authorization Act of 2009 and honor all  of our service members and their families who continue to serve and sacrifice  for the sake of the country, that I am  very appreciative of the leadership of  both Chairman LEVIN and Senator  and,  obviously,  Senator  MCCAINwho has been absent some and  Senator WARNERhas so ably filled in.  Chairman WARNER will always be  chairman to me. He has been my dear  friend through many years. What a  great service to our country this great  American has provided in the true Virginia gentleman tradition. He has always been such an asset to this body  and such an asset to our men and  women  in uniform. I thank Senator  WARNER for his great service, I thank  him for his friendship, and I thank him  for what he does every day for our men  and women in uniform.  ",2008

1344,159,2008-09-16,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President, last  week marked the seventh anniversary  of the day our country was attacked by  terrorists, resulting in the deaths of  approximately  3,000  innocent people.  Since that day and for the past 7 years,  our Nation has devoted itself to winning the global war on terrorism.  It  is astonishing how the commitment of our soldiers, airmen, sailors,  and marines has inspired the Afghan  and Iraqi people to build their own political framework, improve their security and infrastructure, and promote  human rights, freedom, and democracy  in  their  respective  countries.  I am  proud to say that our commitment to  and investment in the global war on  terrorism is now bearing fruits that are  leading to a safer and more democratic  world.  All of our accomplishments in this  area  start with our  servicemembers  and their families who every day face  the challenges, sacrifices, and dangers  inherent  in  the profession of arms.  Congress is entrusted with providing  the necessary resources, policies, and  programs for our servicemembers and  military departments in order to ensure their success.  This year’s National Defense Authorization Act serves as the vehicle to do  just that and provides the resources  and policies to carry out the missions  we ask of our military.  Specifically, the bill provides the following:  An increase of 7,000 soldiers, 5,000 marines, and 3,371 full-time personnel for  the Army National Guard and Army  Reserve over the 2008 force structure  levels; a 3.9-percent pay raise for all  military personnel; a total of $125 billion for military personnel to improve  allowances, bonuses, permanent change  of station moves, and death benefits;  reauthorization of over 25 types of bonuses and special pay to promote enlistment and continued military service; more rigorous oversight procedures  for military  housing  privatization  projects; and a report to Congress on  the implementation of the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program.  I also have several amendments to  the bill, all of which I understand will  be included in a manager’s package. I  wish to discuss these amendments very  briefly.  First, last year, I worked with many  of my colleagues to include a provision  in the National Defense Authorization  bill allowing for members of the Guard  and Reserve who deploy in support of a  contingency operation to receive their  retired pay early based on how much  time they deploy. This year, Senator  KERRYand I, along with 15 other Senators, have offered an amendment that  would make this provision retroactive  to  include any duty performed after  September 11, 2001.  This amendment recognizes a significant  sacrifice  that members of  the  Guard and Reserve and their families  have made since 9/11 in answering the  call of duty. It is only right that their  duty and support of the global war on  terrorism since September 11 be recognized and  included when considering  when they should receive retired pay.  It is my hope we can keep this provision in conference and included in the  final version of the bill.  Also for the Guard and Reserve, I  have offered an amendment, cosponsored by my colleague MARKPRYOR  from Arkansas, which would provide  180 days of transitional health care for  members leaving active duty who agree  to affiliate with the Guard and Reserve. An identical provision was sponsored and included in the House bill by  my good friend Congressman SANFORD  BISHOP from Georgia. This amendment  provides a powerful incentive for members leaving active duty to join the  Guard and Reserve and could result in  several thousand more people entering  the Guard and Reserve each and every  year.  I ask unanimous consent  to have  printed in the RECORDa letter of support for this amendment from the Reserve Officers Association.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  RESERVEOFFICERSASSOCIATION,  Washington, DC, September 15, 2008.  Hon. SAXBYCHAMBLISS,  Chairman of the Senate Reserve Caucus, Russell  Office Building, Washington, DC.  DEARSENATORCHAMBLISS: The Reserve Officers Association, representing 65,000 Reserve Component members, supports Amendment 5356 of the Senate Defense Authorization bill, S. 3001, which grants transitional  health care to active duty personnel as they  become a member of the armed forces reserve component.  It is important to reduce the barriers that  prevent people  from  joining the National  Guard or Reserve. Providing  transitional  TRICARE health coverage permits serving  members and their families to continue with  the same coverage they received while on active duty, and allow them time to qualify for  TRICARE Reserve Select. Your amendment  provides a recruiting  incentive that helps  the individual, his or her family and the  armed forces.  Thank you for your efforts on this key  issue, and other support to the military that  you have shown in the past. Please feel free  to have your staff call ROA’s legislative director, Marshall Hanson with any question  or issue you would like to discuss.  Sincerely,  DENNISM. MCCARTHY,  Lieutenant General USMC (Retired),  Executive Director.  ",2008
1345,159,2008-09-16,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President, another amendment I have offered to the  bill, along with my colleague  from  Georgia, Senator ISAKSON, provides a  sense of the Senate on the care of  wounded warriors. Last year’s Defense  Authorization  bill  contained  the  Wounded Warrior Act which went a  long way to helping DOD and Department of Veterans Affairs establish a  network of recovery care coordinators  who would work to manage and coordinate care for recovering servicemembers. This is a powerful program and  stands to make a huge impact in the  lives of our wounded warriors. My  amendment calls on DOD and the VA  to expedite  the  recruiting,  training,  and hiring of these personnel, and also  to partner with civilian institutions,  such as the Medical College of Georgia  School of Nursing, to help train these  personnel and ensure they have access  to the most up-to-date research and  skills in order to best serve our wounded warriors.  Two other amendments I will mention briefly are first a sense of the Senate that the Air Force should conduct  a robust demonstration of the SYERS  system on the Joint STARS aircraft.  SYERS would  provide  an  expanded  combat  identification  capability  for  Joint STARS and the Air Force should  fully explore its utility and the possibility of incorporating SYERS on the  entire Joint STARS fleet.  Second, I have offered an amendment  that would require DOD to report to  Congress on the requirement for Non-  dual  status National Guard  technicians. These personnel are often used  to backfill deploying Guard personnel,  and due to the large number of deployments, we need to look at expanding  the number of Non-dual status technicians  as  a means  of  ensuring  the  Guard’s home State missions are not  neglected.

1346,187,2008-09-16,Mr.  CRAPO.," Mr.  President,  the  Olympic Games has always been a time  for the world to celebrate the triumph  of the human spirit and personal qualities  that determine  excellence: discipline, commitment and a positive,  winning attitude. Athletes  from all  over the world bring pride to their  countries,  friends and  family during  the Olympic Games. Most importantly,  they achieve the distinction that can  come when an individual applies determination and hard work to develop a  God-given talent. Motivated to get up  early, often before work, to pound the  pavement, ride the roads and trails,  shoot baskets, hit balls, lift weights or  swim laps, these women and men are  committed  to  improving  their  strength, agility, speed and stamina. I  am especially proud of the Idahoans  who competed  in the 2008 Olympics,  representing their teams, their Nation  and their families with skill and pride.  As you may know, Boise resident  Kristin Armstrong won the gold in the  women’s cycling time trial. Kristin is  well known around  the Boise area:  many have seen her cycling or at the  local YMCA where she is an instructor.  She  is an  inspiration to those who  know her and  she has made  Idaho  proud. Bishop Kelly High School graduate Nick Symmonds advanced to the  preliminary round in the 800 meter run.  Georgia Gould, a one-time Ketchum  resident  competed  in  the women’s  mountain bike race. Team USA also included Idahoans: Matt Brown, a graduate of Coeur d’Alene High School,  played third baseman for Team USA in  baseball.  Debbie  McDonald,  from  Hailey, competed  for Team USA  in  dressage. Idahoans excelled on teams  from  other  nations  as well. Clare  Bodensteiner, a graduate of Minico  High School, played for the New Zealand basketball team. Angela Whyte, a  former University of Idaho runner and  now assistant coach competed for Canada  in  the  100 meter hurdles and,  Joachim Olsen, also a University of  Idaho athlete, competed in the shot put  for Denmark.  Emerson  Frostad,  a  former Lewis-Clark State College baseball player played for Team Canada as  a catcher/first baseman. Eric Matthias,  a Boise resident and in graduate school  at Boise State University, competed  for the British Virgin Islands in the  discus throw.  And in the Paralympics—the second-  largest  sporting event  in  the world  after  the  Olympics—that  are  concluding in Beijing this week, Idaho native Barbara Buchan took the gold in  the 3,000 meter cycling event. Barbara  was the 1972 high school mile run State  champion from Mountain Home High  School and went on to graduate from  Boise State University. She was severely injured in a cycling accident in  1982, suffering almost fatal wounds. In  addition to terrible physical injuries,  she was in a coma for 2 months and had  surgery to remove the damaged parts  of her brain. After years of physical  and mental  rehabilitation, Barbara  came back, her passion for cycling unchanged. A five-time Paralympics competitor at 52 years old, Barbara embodies the Olympic spirit.  To all these courageous, gifted and  dedicated Idaho athletes, I offer my  heartfelt congratulations for a job well  done. You continue  to make  Idaho  proud.  f  ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY RIGHTS ACT  ",2008
1347,187,2008-09-16,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  I  would like to inform my colleagues of  my request to be notified of any unanimous consent agreement that would  allow for the consideration of S. 3325,  the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Act of 2008. I intend to reserve my right to object to any such  request.  S. 3325 was marked up by the Judiciary  Committee  just  last Thursday  afternoon. I circulated several amendments to address a number of concerns  I had about the bill. Two of my amendments—one that would add USDA to  the list of agencies on the IPEC Advisory Committee,  and  another  that  would provide for an orderly transition  from NIPLECC to IPEC—were adopted  by the committee. However, I withheld  from offering other amendments because I received a commitment that  the chairman and ranking member of  the Judiciary Committee would work  with me to address my other concerns.  For example, I have concerns with  the funding of the new State and local  law  enforcement grant programs  in  section 501 and the grant match ratio  for those programs. Further,  I have  concerns with the creation of a new intellectual property crimes unit at the  FBI to enforce  intellectual property  rights and the authorization of additional funding, resources and staff for  the FBI to implement these additional  responsibilities. I firmly believe that  the FBI should focus its efforts on combating terrorism. I am concerned about  duplication with work currently being  performed at ICE and its National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center. Moreover, I am concerned  with  language  calling  for  the  prioritization of cases  involving  foreign  controlled  companies,  and  the  lack of any priority for cases investigated by the FBI that have a nexis to  potential terrorist activities.  My staff will be sitting down with  the chairman and ranking member’s  staff to work on my concerns. Again, I  intend to reserve my right to object to  proceeding to the consideration of S.  3325 until my concerns have been addressed.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  BURLINGTON COMMUNITY  EDUCATION  ∑",2008
1348,187,2008-09-16,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, in Iowa  and across the United States, a new  school year has begun. As you know,  Iowa public schools have an excellent  reputation nationwide, and Iowa students’ test scores are among the highest in the Nation.  I would like to take just a few minutes, today, to salute the dedicated  teachers, administrators, and  school  board members in the Burlington Community School District, and to report  on their participation in a unique Federal partnership to repair and modernize school facilities.  This fall marks the 10th year of the  Iowa  Demonstration  Construction  Grant Program. That  is  its  formal  name, but it is better known among  educators in Iowa as the program of  Harkin grants for Iowa public schools.  Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 million  for the  State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school districts to receive  these grants for a range of renovation  and repair efforts—everything from updating fire-safety systems to building  new schools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal  funding is used to leverage public and/  or private local funding, so it often has  a tremendous multiplier effect  in a  local school district.  The Burlington Community School  District received a 2006 Harkin grant  totaling $500,000 which it used to help  build a new elementary school. Sunnyside Elementary is a modern, state-of-  the-art  facility that befits the educational ambitions and excellence of  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:10 Mar 19, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€8SENATE\S16SE8.REC S16SE8 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2008

Con. Res. 35 and H. Res. 28) that ‘‘it is the  sense of Congress that the Government of  the Russian Federation should issue a clear  and unambiguous  statement of admission  and condemnation of the illegal occupation  and annexation by the Soviet Union from  1940 to 1991 of the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the consequences  of which will be a significant increase in  good will among the affected people’’;  Whereas Latvia has successfully developed  as a free and democratic country, ensured  the rule of law, and developed a free market  economy;  Whereas the Government of Latvia has  constantly pursued a course of integration of  that country into the community of free and  democratic nations, becoming a full and responsible member of the United Nations, the  Organization for Security and Cooperation in  Europe, the European Union, and the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization;  Whereas the people of Latvia cherish the  principles  of  political  freedom,  human  rights, and independence; and  Whereas Latvia is a strong and loyal ally  of the United States, and the people of Latvia share common values with the people of  the United States: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That Congress—  (1) congratulates the people of Latvia on  the occasion of the 90th anniversary of that  country’s November 18, 1918, declaration of  independence;  (2) commends the Government of Latvia  for its success in implementing political and  economic reforms, for establishing political,  religious and economic freedom, and for its  strong  commitment  to human  and  civil  rights;  (3)  recognizes  the  common  goals  and  shared values of the people of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the close and friendly relations and ties of the three Baltic countries  with one other, and their tragic history in  the last century under the Nazi and Soviet  occupations;  (4) calls on the President to issue a proclamation congratulating the people of Latvia  on the 90th anniversary of the declaration of  Latvia’s independence on November 18, 1918;  (5) respectfully requests the President to  congratulate the Government of Latvia for  its commitment to democracy, a free market  economy, human rights, the rule of law, participation in a wide range of international  structures, and security cooperation with  the United States Government; and  (6) calls on the President and Secretary of  State to urge the Government of the Russian  Federation to acknowledge that the Soviet  occupation of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania  under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and for  the succeeding 51 years was illegal.  f  SIGNING AUTHORITY—S. 3406  ",2008

1360,236,2008-09-16,Mr. BRALEY of  Iowa.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise today to thank and congratulate Colonel  Craig Cotter and the dedicated working men  and women at  the Joint Manufacturing and  Technology Center located at the Rock Island  Arsenal federal campus.  Since 1862  the Rock  Island Arsenal has  been providing  the supplies and equipment  American soldiers need to protect this country.  Today  the  Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center (JMTC)—under  the command  of  the Army Materiel Command—continues  that proud tradition of meeting the needs of  our Armed Forces.  JMTC’s technological and manufacturing expertise has been essential  to protecting our  nation in the 21st Century. At no time was this  fact more evident than when insurgents in Iraq  began using improvised explosive devices to  attack Humvees and other military vehicles.  The Army needed an immediate solution and  JMTC was  the  only manufacturing  center  ready and able to provide it. JMTC used their  rapid-response design and manufacturing capacity  to produce dozens of  ‘‘up-armor kits’’  before final engineering was even complete. In  a matter of days the first armor kits were designed, produced, and on their way to Iraq. To  date, JMTC has produced thousands of armor  kits and is poised to expand their armaments  development into new titanium and lightweight  composite materials.  JMTC is truly a center of industrial and technological excellence. In 2006 and 2007 they  earned  the Shingo Prize Public Sector Gold  Medallion  for  the Forward Repair System,  making JMTC the Army’s only two time winner  of this prestigious award. JMTC has also met  high work standards with  the M119 Towed  Howitzer, gunner protection armor kit, shop  equipment contact maintenance vehicle, and  small arms parts program.  Madam Speaker,  the women and men at  JMTC are indispensable to our long-term national security. This  facility  is poised  to develop the materials and technologies we will  need to protect the United States for decades  to come.  f  HONORING PASTOR DONALD BATTLE  OF  DIVINE  FAITH  MINISTRIES INTERNATIONAL  Georgia law enforcement as a police detective  for the City of Atlanta.

Today, Madam  Speaker, Divine Faith Ministries  International  currently serves God with a membership of  over 8,000. This explosive growth can be directly traced to the servant leadership of Pastor Battle and his family.  But Pastor Battle does not content himself  with service in the church alone. A leader in  the community, Pastor Battle has served  in  the Association of Christian Ministers of Clayton County, and guided  the creation of  the  Clayton County Public Schools’ Mentorship  Forum. The forum includes business leaders,  judicial system leaders, state and local elected  officials and pastors who serve to mentor high  school students. Pastor Battle also led the call  for  incorporating  the  faith community  in  the  Clayton County youth offender program  to  allow churches to be involved in the juvenile  offenders’ community service program.  Other  examples  of  Pastor  Battle’s  unshakable commitment  to  the 13th District  and the entire Atlanta area are Divine Faith  Ministries  International  television broadcasts  which reach  thousands of homes weekly, a  day  care  program—Divine Faith Ministries  Christian Academy, and the Divine Faith Ministries School of Biblical Studies.  Again Madam Speaker,  I am honored  to  recognize this great man on his birthday. His  presence, his purpose and his commitment to  service have blessed not only his family, his  friends and his congregation, but undoubtedly  the entire world as the effects of his ministry  are felt in the hearts of thousands.

Madam  Speaker, on September 15, 2008,  I missed  rollcall votes numbered 589, a resolution honoring the dedication and outstanding work of  military support groups across the country for  their steadfast support of the members of our  Armed Forces and their families; 590, a resolution honoring  the 28th  Infantry Division  for  serving and protecting the United States; and  591, a bill to extend the authority of the Secretary of Education  to purchase guaranteed  student loans for an additional year, and for  other purposes.

1368,250,2008-09-16,Mr. RUSH.," Madam Speaker,  the Department of Justice  tells us  that, everyday, 45  people, on average, are  fatally shot  in  the  United States.  It  is with a heavy heart  that,  today, I offer my condolences to the people of  my community as I mourn the senseless loss  of  life  of Chicago Police Officer Dannie  Marchan, 29, and his daughter, seven-year-old  Alizay. Police report these gun-related deaths  as a murder suicide with Officer Marchan alleged to have taken his own life after shooting  his two children.  This  incident happened yesterday morning  and, as of this time, Marchan’s 9-year-old son,  whose name has not been released,  is still  fighting  for his  life with his mother, Officer  Marchan’s ex-wife, at his side.  This senseless loss of life should not happen  to anyone.  In an  instant  that can’t be  taken  back, Officer Marchan  handled  his  stresses with a loaded weapon leaving devastating loss in its wake.  Americans of conscience must come  together  to stop  the senseless death of  ‘‘The  Daily 45.’’ When will we  say  ‘‘enough  is  enough, stop the killing!’’  f  INTRODUCTION  OF  THE  BRUCE  VENTO BAN ASBESTOS AND PREVENT MESOTHELIOMA ACT OF  2008  HON.

1369,250,2008-09-16,Mr. GENE GREEN  of  Texas.," Madam  Speaker, today marks a milestone for the U.S.  House of Representatives in the fight against  asbestos-related disease. The Bruce Vento  Act is strong and comprehensive legislation to  prohibit asbestos-containing products in commerce.  As chairman of  the Subcommittee on  the  Environment and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee, I believe action to eliminate asbestos-containing products  from  the U.S. economy and prevent asbestos-related disease is  long overdue.  We are proud to have the support of the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, the  Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation,  the AFL–CIO, the American Public Health Association,  the Environmental Working Group,  and other asbestos organizations.

Communal prayer teaches  us to live with grateful hearts, even in  tense and depressing times. We thank  You, Lord, for the gifts of family, the  benefits of daily work and the freedoms  of this Nation.  As Congress assembles  for another  week, may our prayer together turn  our hearts from self-seeking to a true  awareness of our communal sharing in  Your goodness and the necessary efforts to protect our national interests  and clear the way to economic stability for all.

",2008
1373,3,2008-09-22,Mr. STEARNS.," Madam Speaker, the  title of my 1-minute is called  ‘‘Taxpayers Sacrifice All and Receive Nothing.’’  The plan that developed this weekend  for a comprehensive bailout of private  sector financial institutions put taxpayers at risk with little or no benefit  to those who pay the taxes.  This plan will put taxpayers at a risk  for losses that belong to those companies  that  recklessly  sought  profits,  profits for the stockholders and executives through dividends, salaries, bonuses and presumed  stock appreciation. Instead, taxpayers who assume  this risk should also enjoy an equity  premium that goes beyond the return  of their funds with interest for this  bailout.  The taxpayers, after being awarded  interest from their funds, as if they  had invested in bonds, should have warrants as an equity kicker to sweeten  their deal, giving them premium for  their  risk. Any  institutional  lender  would demand as much and more. In  this way, the taxpayers could share in  the upside success of the companies  that they rescue.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2008

The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:  CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.—The  H.R. 4828  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park Boundary Expansion and Redesignation Act of 2008’’.  SEC. 2.

1384,17,2008-09-22,Ms. BORDALLO.," Madam Speaker,  Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic  Site, located in Brownsville, Texas, is  the only National Park Service unit  dedicated to the preservation and interpretation of the Mexican-American  War. The park preserves the site of the  Battle of Palo Alto, the first battle of  the war, but fighting was not limited  to the parcel of  land currently preserved by the park. Fighting at a site  called Resaca de la Palma proved pivotal  in  permanently  repulsing  the  Mexican army from Texas.  H.R. 4828 would amend the act creating Palo Alto Battlefield National  Historic Site to designate the 34 acres  of the Resaca de la Palma as a unit of  the park. In recognition of the expansion of the park to include the noncontiguous Resaca de la Palma unit,  the bill will also redesignate Palo Alto  Battlefield National Historic Site as  Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park.  This is a good piece of legislation,  and I commend my colleague and my  good  friend, Representative SOLOMON  ORTIZfrom Texas, for his hard work on  adding this unit to the park. I enthusiastically  support  passage  of  this  measure.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2008
1385,17,2008-09-22,Mr.  YOUNG  of  Alaska.," Madam  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I rise in strong support of this legislation. The Palo Alto battlefield  in  Brownsville, Texas is the site of the  second battle of the U.S. War with  Mexico. During the battle, American  forces  drove Mexican  troops  back  across the Rio Grande River. This bill  adds 34 acres to the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site and provides  for  a  cooperative  agreement  under which the Brownsville Community Foundation and the National Park  Service would co-manage this land that  is owned by the foundation.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2008
1386,17,2008-09-22,Ms. BORDALLO.," Madam Speaker, I  yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ORTIZ),  the sponsor of this bill.  ",2008
1387,17,2008-09-22,Mr. ORTIZ.," Madam Speaker, I want  to say thank you to both Chairman  Bordallo and my good friend from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG) who have had an opportunity to spend time in my district.  Today I rise in support of H.R. 4828,  the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park Boundary Expansion and  Redesignation Act of 2008. The battle of  Resaca de la Palma—fought in 1846 in  what is now the city of Brownsville,  Texas—marked one of the early victories  in  the United States-Mexican  War for the American forces.  General Zachary Taylor, who would  later become the 12th President of the  United States, was a very notable participant in this battle.  b1315  The United States troops suffered 45  men dead and 228 wounded; Mexican  forces counted 169 dead and 228 wounded.  H.R. 4828 will expand the Palo Alto  Battlefield National Historic Site, currently under the National Park Service, to include the Resaca de la Palma  Battlefield site.  The bill will preserve the battlefield  site,  support  education  and  special  events there, and develop an interpretive trail with exhibits, living history  programs, and other community gatherings.  The site will also conserve the increasingly rare Rio Grande delta landscape and protect native  chaparral,  prairie and brush, and native species. It  used to be more than 100 acres, but now  it has been reduced to 34 aches of land,  so we need to preserve this site.  Though the battle at Resaca de la  Palma was fought by two warring nations, it is historically significant because it is unique to the south Texas  border culture. More than just a relic  of the past, the Resaca de la Palma  Battlefield is a vast, outdoor classroom  that preserves a vital piece of our Nation’s history.  My hope is that scholars, historians,  and everyday citizens will learn and  appreciate the sacrifice of all those  who perished here on this battlefield.  A coalition of local groups, community leaders, and private citizens has  done a tremendous job in maintaining  the Resaca de  la Palma.  I wish to  thank them for their hard work and  dedication in preserving an important  piece of our Nation’s history.  But it is now vital for the site to  have full support and resources that  only the National Park Service can  provide. I ask my colleagues to join me  in support of this legislation.  And  I  thank  you  and Chairman  and Chairman BORDALLO for  supporting this bill.  ",2008

Res. 1374) commemorating  the  75th  anniversary  of  the  Grand Coulee Dam and recognizing its  critical role in the national and economic security of the United States  and the contributions of hydroelectric  power to the reduction of greenhouse  gas emissions.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:  H. RES. 1374  Whereas the Grand Coulee Dam was one of  the largest public construction projects of  President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s  ‘‘New  Deal’’, in response to the Great Depression;  Whereas construction of the Grand Coulee  Dam began in the summer of 1933 and was  completed in 1942;  Whereas 107  individuals  lost their  during the construction process;  Whereas the Grand Coulee Dam became the  largest concrete structure in the world, with  12 million cubic yards of concrete—enough to  build a sidewalk around the Earth twice;  Whereas during World War II electricity  from the Grand Coulee Dam was needed to  lives  run the aluminum plants that supported the  production of ships and planes;  Whereas forecasts of energy shortages in  the 1960s led to the construction of a 3rd  power plant at the Grand Coulee Dam, more  than doubling its generating capacity;  Whereas the 3 primary purposes of the  Grand Coulee Dam are generating 6.5 million  kilowatts of electricity, supplying water for  irrigation as part of the Columbia Basin  Project, and providing much-needed  flood  control to the Columbia River Basin;  Whereas the Columbia Basin Project includes 300 miles of canals and more than  3,000 miles of irrigation ditches, which supply water to 500,000 acres of farmland, an  area twice the size of the State of Delaware;  Whereas the crops grown on this farmland  are worth more than $500 million per year;  and  Whereas the Grand Coulee Dam is the cornerstone of the electric power system in the  State of Washington and the largest hydroelectric power  facility  in North America:  Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives—  (1) commemorates the 75th anniversary of  the Grand Coulee Dam;  (2) honors the sacrifice of the 107 individuals who lost their lives during the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam; and  (3) recognizes that—  (A) the Grand Coulee Dam continues to  play a critical role in the national and economic security of the United States by providing vital electric power and crop irrigation;  (B) hydroelectric power is a clean, renewable  resource  that  is  emissions-free and  plays a major role in controlling emissions  of greenhouse gases; and  (C) having clean, affordable hydroelectric  power helps reduce the reliance of the United  States on foreign oil imports and supports  the successful wind power industry in the  Northwestern United States by ensuring the  availability of electricity in the absence of  sufficient wind power.

I would  like to commend my colleague,  Congresswoman  RODGERS, for her sponsorship of this  resolution and her efforts to champion  hydropower as an important source of  energy generation.  I ask my colleagues to support passage of this resolution.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  MCMORRIS  ",2008
1397,24,2008-09-22,Mr.  YOUNG  of  Alaska.," Madam  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the resolution authored by CATHY  HASTINGS,  MCMORRIS RODGERS, DOC and the entire State of Washington delegation.  The Grand Coulee Dam is the largest  concrete structure ever built  in the  United States, with enough concrete to  build a  sidewalk around  the Earth  twice. The dam helped us win World  War II by providing much needed electricity  to  build  fighter  planes  and  naval ships. The dam was also constructed to provide flood control, recreation and irrigation.  b1345  Today, it serves over 600,000 acres of  irrigated  cropland which  feeds  consumers  nationwide  and  around  the  world.  As you know, we have major energy  problems  in this Nation. The Grand  Coulee Dam is an example of what our  country has done right. It’s a shining  beacon of clean, renewable, domestic  energy.  In  2006,  the  dam  provided  22,000  gigawatts  of  emission-free  hydroelectricity. This translates into  the reduction of 18 million tons of carbon dioxide, into 55,000 tons of sulfur  dioxide and into 44,000 tons of nitrogen  oxide.  Without this clean form of energy,  36.4 barrels of fuel oil, 10.7 million tons  of coal or 223 billion cubic feet of natural gas will have to be used to keep  the lights on. In fact, Grand Coulee is  so environmentally friendly that the  NBC Today Show focused solely on the  dam as part of the Earth Day broadcast.  Despite the consensus that hydropower  is clean, renewable and emissions-free,  the Democrat  leadership  continues to exclude long-term hydropower resources, such as the Grand  Coulee Dam, as part of its proposed renewable  portfolio  standard. This  is  logic-free given the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that I just mentioned. We hope the Democrats come to  their senses and see the reality that  large hydropower  sources  should be  counted as a renewable resource in future bills.  Madam  Speaker,  this  resolution  couldn’t be brought up at a better  time. I strongly support the 75th anniversary of the Grand Coulee Dam.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2008

You are ratifying this compact, and  the only way you can only come back  into  this  compact  is  through  the  States, and not necessarily the Federal  Government.  b1415  ",2008
1407,38,2008-09-22,Ms. SUTTON.," Well, I respectfully disagree with the gentleman. We are not  really giving up our rights. This has always been a joint effort with a specific  responsibility left with the States, a  specific  responsibility  left with  this  Congress, and we retained this.  ",2008
1408,38,2008-09-22,Mr. STUPAK.," Four of the five Great  Lakes are international bodies of water  where the States have no say over it.  That’s why the Federal Government  must ratify it. If we continue to ratify  this compact without getting our answers, you cannot go back and reopen  the  international  agreement  unless  both sides agree, including the eight  States and the two provinces of Canada.  ",2008
1409,38,2008-09-22,Ms. SUTTON., I thank the gentleman  for the point that he raises. I believe  that the agreement and the committee  report  language effectively addresses  that concern.  ,2008
1410,38,2008-09-22,Mr. STUPAK., I have one other inquiry: Why are we rushing this compact? There is no end date that it has  to be done before the end of the year.  It’s an open-ended commitment. Why  can’t we wait? What’s the rush?  ,2008
1411,38,2008-09-22,Ms. SUTTON.," I will take back my  time, and I will answer the gentleman’s  question.  Mr. Speaker, our Great Lakes’ water  is currently, at present, at risk to be  carelessly diverted from our basin, and  that is why action is so important here  today. If we allow that to happen, this  water will never return.  All eight Great Lakes States have  agreed to this compact. I would like to  thank Ohio’s Governor Ted Strickland  for  guiding  this  essential  compact  through the Ohio State House and Senate.  A  stretch of Lake Erie  shoreline  touches my congressional district, and  Lake Erie contributes over $9 billion in  tourism and  travel  revenue  to our  State’s economy. In my district we already utilize Lake Erie commercially  through Lorain Harbor, and we need  this  compact  to protect our Great  Lakes, our water, our source of recreation, our jobs and our economy, and  we need this compact now.  For the overall health of our Great  Lakes and our region, we must pass  this  compact  today  to protect our  Great Lakes and ensure that  future  generations will have this great resource. I urge my colleagues to support  the Great Lakes compact.  ",2008
1412,38,2008-09-22,Mr. EHLERS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong support of S.J. Res. 45,  the Great  Lakes—St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact. This resolution represents  the culmination of efforts, which started nearly  a decade ago, to create a framework to govern water withdrawals from the Great Lakes  Basin.  The Great  Lakes  comprise  the  largest  source of freshwater in the world—20 percent  of the Earth’s total and 95 percent of the surface freshwater in the United States—and they  provide  drinking water,  transportation  and  recreation to tens of millions of people in the  United States and Canada. Although the Great  Lakes contain copious amounts of fresh water,  less  than one percent of  the water  in  the  Great Lakes  is renewed every year  through  rain, snow melt, and groundwater  recharge,  with the remaining ninety-nine percent remaining in the lakes each year. In other words, the  Great Lakes are a non-renewable  resource  that is currently at jeopardy from large-scale  water  diversions  outside  the Great  Lakes  Basin.  The catalyst  for  the creation of a Great  Lakes Compact came in 1998 when the government of Ontario granted a permit to a private Canadian company to ship up to 160 million gallons of water per year to Asia. Thankfully,  the public outcry was so strongly opposed that the deal died.  In  the wake of  this  incident, Congress  included language in the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2000 which prohibited the export of Great Lakes water from the  basin unless  the  request  for withdrawal  received unanimous approval of all eight Great  Lakes governors. WRDA 2000 also encouraged the Great Lakes states, in consultation  with Canada,  to develop and  implement a  compact  that would govern withdrawals of  water from the Great Lakes Basin.  In 2005,  the 8 Great Lakes governors,  in  collaboration with the Canadian provinces of  Ontario and Quebec, local governments, and  other stakeholders, endorsed the Great Lakes  Compact and referred it to the state legislatures for consideration.  On July 9, 2008, my home state of Michigan  became the last Great Lake state to approve  the Compact—sending it to Congress for final  ratification.  The Senate passed S.J. Res. 45 by unanimous consent on August 1 and the House Judiciary Committee approved a similar House  version (H.R. 6577) by voice vote on July 30.  I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 6577.  The Great Lakes Compact prohibits new or  increased out-of-basin,  large-scale water diversions except under special circumstances,  and it requires all of the Great Lakes states to  develop water conservation and efficiency programs.  With respect to small-scale water diversions  (containers less than 5.7 gallons), such as for  bottled water, beer, and canned  foods,  the  Compact allows states to choose how to regulate these small transfers. For instance, Michigan regulates bottled water under  the Compact by requiring producers to obtain a state  permit for new or increased water withdrawals  of more than 200,000 gallons per day. Under  Michigan  law, a permit may be granted  if,  among other requirements, there are no individual or  cumulative adverse  impacts,  the  water withdrawal is reasonable under common  law principles, and the producer has certified  that it is in compliance with water conservation  measures.  Although some have voiced concern over  this ‘‘bottled water exemption,’’ I believe these  small-scale withdrawals are better left to the  states  to  regulate.  In addition, much of  the  bottled water will likely remain the Great Lakes  watershed, and changing the agreement now  would mean  the entire process must start  over. With water predicted to become the oil  of the future, it is imperative that we pass this  agreement now so that we ensure the water in  the Great Lakes Basin stays within the basin.  I hope my colleagues will join me, the Great  Lakes governors, state legislatures, the U.S.  Senate, and President Bush in supporting the  Great Lakes Compact. Vote for S.J. Res. 45.  ",2008
1413,38,2008-09-22,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong support of S.J. Res. 45,  the Great  Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact.  In July, I, together with the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. CONYERS, Jr.), Chairman of the  Committee on  the Judiciary,  the gentleman  from Ohio  (Mr. LATOURETTE), and  the gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr. EHLERS),  introduced H.R. 6577, the ‘‘Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact’’, the House companion bill for the legislation that we consider today.  H.R. 6577 received the bipartisan support of  almost 50 Great Lakes Members and  the  Committee on the Judiciary ordered the bill reported  favorably  to  the House on July 30.  However,  to expedite  implementation of  the  Compact, the House agreed to consider the  Senate companion legislation (S.J. Res. 45),  which  the other body passed on August 1.  Today, we hope to complete the long process  for  implementation of  the Great Lakes-St.  Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact by sending this ‘‘consent of Congress’’ directly to the President, where he has said he  will sign it. I strongly urge my colleagues to  support this important legislation for the protection of the Great Lakes for current and future generations.  Mr. Speaker, the Great Lakes are national  and  international  treasures, serving as both  the nation’s largest fresh water resource and  one of the largest systems of fresh water on  earth—containing nearly 20 percent of  the  world  supply. Formed  by melting  glaciers  10,000 to 12,000 years ago, the Great Lakes  contain enough fresh water to cover the entire  landmass of the continental United States to a  depth of almost 10 feet.  Yet,  despite  their massive  volume,  the  Lakes’ water is a fragile resource. Rainfall and  snowmelt replenish only about one percent of  the water in the Great Lakes each year, with  the remaining 99 percent of the volume being  carried over from year-to-year. It is this unique  circumstance  that  requires  the nation, and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:56 Sep 23, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K22SE7.067 H22SEPT1 E S U O H h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l e b j         ",2008

1417,45,2008-09-22,Ms. SUTTON.,"  I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1438 is sponsored  by our colleagues from California, Representatives NUNESand COSTA.  H. Res. 1438 commemorates the 50th  anniversary of  the Azorean Refugee  Act of 1958, and celebrates the extensive contributions of Portuguese-American communities to the United States.  From September 27, 1957, until October 24, 1958, a series of violent disruptions and earthquakes destroyed the  infrastructure  of  Faial  Island,  in  Portgual’s Azores archipelago, and impacted the other eight islands in the  Azores as well.  The majority of the Faial Island’s  25,000 people lost their livelihoods in  the midst of fumes, smoke, lava and  constant  earthquakes,  and  had  no  choice but to escape to other islands in  the Azores.  The United States, as we so often  have in crises of these magnitudes, offered a helping hand to the distressed  people of the region through the Azorean Refugee Act. This was spearheaded  by Senators John Pastore of Rhode Island and John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts.  The Azorean Refugee Act made 1,500  special  non-quota  immigrant  visas  available to the destitute victims of  the Capelinhos Volcano in the Azores.  It was later extended to allow entry of  an even greater number of refugees.  As a result, more than 175,000 Azoreans came to the United States between 1960 and 1980. The 2000 census  placed the total number of Portuguese  Americans at 1,176,615. The vast majority of these are of Azorean descent.  The communities founded by those  immigrants can be  found  in  southeastern New England, the areas around  San Francisco, San Diego, and San  Joaquin Valley, California, Hawaii, and  the New Jersey/New York metropolitan  area.  In a very short period of time, these  immigrants have built on the accomplishments of earlier arrivals. Through  their remarkable work ethic, they have  distinguished themselves in innumerable fields of endeavor, especially in  farming  and  fishing. By  the  1970s,  roughly half of all of the dairy farms in  the San Joaquin Valley were owned  and operated by Portuguese Americans, helping to make California the  number one dairy-producing State in  the Nation.  b1445  On the East Coast, Portuguese-Americans have played a prominent role in  the fishing industry, and contributed  to making New Bedford, Massachusetts  one of our Nation’s greatest seaports.  Portuguese immigrants and their descendants have  contributed  substantially to this Nation. They are leaders  in business, culture and many other  professions. They are found in every  level of government and in our military, proudly serve the Nation that offered them a helping hand when they  needed it most.  This Nation has been repaid many  times over during the last half century  by these immigrants from the Azores  and their descendents. Their success  story is a demonstration of just what  makes our country so great and so  strong. By welcoming people with talent and  initiative  from around  the  world, we have become a better nation.  The Azoreans are a prime example of  just how important this has been to the  United States over the generations.  I am pleased to stand with my colleagues to mark the 50th anniversary  of the Azorean Refugee Act of 1958. It is  fitting that we honor this group of  Americans and recall how well they  have  repaid our generosity and our  openness. It is a lesson for our generation and for future generations.  I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2008
1418,45,2008-09-22,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield such  time to myself as I may consume.  I support this resolution. H. Res. 1438,  Mr. Speaker, commemorates the 50th  anniversary of  the Azorean Refugee  Act of 1958, and celebrates the contributions that Portuguese-Americans  have made to the United States.  In the late 1950s a series of volcanic  eruptions and earthquakes devastated  the Portuguese Azorean islands. In an  important humanitarian gesture, the  United States absorbed thousands of  Azorean refugees following the enactment of the Azorean Refugee Act of  1958.  Since that time, hundreds of thousands  of Azoreans  and  other Portuguese have migrated to the United  States. They have made important contributions to many aspects of American society and the American economy. They are most well-known  for  their contributions to America’s fishing and dairy industries.  President Jaime Gama of the Portuguese Parliament, the Assembly of  the Republic, is currently heading a  delegation visiting Washington. This is  a perfect opportunity for us to pass H.  Res. 1438 to commemorate the Azorean  Refugee Act, and to acknowledge the  continuing  friendship  between  the  American and the Portuguese people.  I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2008

1420,45,2008-09-22,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker, today it is  my honor to rise in strong support of  House Resolution  1438, which  commemorates, as noted by the two previous speakers, the 50th anniversary of  the Azorean Refugee Act of 1958.  This resolution is sponsored by the  Portuguese Caucus, my colleagues and  good friend Congressman DEVINNUNES  and  Congressman DENNIS We’ve worked on this together, not  only to take note of this significant anniversary, but also to coordinate with  our guests, the President of the Portuguese Parliament and three members  of the House of Deputies.  It was September 27, 1957, when the  island of Faial experienced a series of  volcanic eruptions that lasted for over  a year and shattered the economic infrastructure of that island, and had impacts throughout the Archipelago.  During that time, two great United  States  Senators,  John  Pastore  of  Rhode Island, who represented a large  Portuguese constituency, and Senator  John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts,  later to become the 35th President of  the United States, offered to help those  who were suffering as a result of this  natural event that devastated the islands. They did so by drafting and passing the law of Azorean Refugee Act of  1958.  CARDOZA.

1431,59,2008-09-22,Mr. HALL of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise, of course, in support of S. 2606, a  bill reauthorizing the United States  Fire Administration. It’s a companion  bill  to H.R.  4847, which passed  the  House in April with unanimous support  after moving through the Committee  on Science and Technology by regular  order.  This act authorizes the activities of  the United States Fire Administration  for fiscal year 2009 through 2012. USFA  provides critical support to our Nation’s  firefighters  through  training,  through research and development and  through  logistical  support. For  instance, the USFA provides firefighter  training to over 80,000 firefighters per  year; it compiles nationwide data on  fire control and prevention activities,  and  it oversees the  fire grants programs  that  have  dramatically  improved the capabilities and the preparedness of our Nation’s fire services.  This is an extremely important agency in our committee’s jurisdiction. I’d  like to thank Mr. MITCHELL and Dr.  GINGREY, vice chair and ranking member of the Technology and Innovation  Subcommittee,  for  their hard work  over the past year on this matter.  The United States Fire Administration does a wonderful job of providing  support to first responders across the  country.

1434,59,2008-09-22,Mr. GINGREY.," Mr. Speaker, I risk in strong  support of S. 2606, the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008.  This  legislation  reauthorizes  the United  States Fire Administration  (USFA)  for  fiscal  years 2009 through 2012 for the agency’s activities  in  training,  fire education and awareness, data collection, research, and standards  development and promotion. S. 2606 provides  $291 million in federal funds over this 5-year  period, which is consistent with previously authorized levels and allows only for a modest  growth in funding, capped at 3 percent in any  of the fiscal years covered by this bill.  The mission of USFA is to limit economic  and  life  loss  ‘‘due  to  fire and related emergencies, through leadership, advocacy, coordination and support.’’ This organization provides vital assistance in the areas of training,  fire education and awareness, and awards  grants to a number of local fire departments  across the country. Since its inception in 1974,  USFA has  trained over 1 million  firefighters  through  local delivery  courses as well as  through the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland. USFA has provided support  critical to reducing deaths and injuries in the  U.S.  from  fire by 25 percent between 1996  and 2006.  S. 2606  is  the Senate companion bill  to  H.R. 4847, which the House passed on April  3rd of this year by a vote of 412–0. The Senate  bill  includes  the  same  authorization  amounts and makes minor modifications to the  House-passed version  that only  further  improve the legislation. I am proud to say that  this legislation has been crafted in both a bipartisan and bicameral way—with community  stakeholders—to ensure  that  it meets  the  needs of our  firefighting community.  I commend my colleagues on  the Science Committee in particular Chairman GORDON, Ranking Member HALL and Mr. MITCHELL of Arizona, who is the lead sponsor of the House-  passed bill—for their diligence in bringing this  important legislation to the House floor today.  Mr. Speaker, S. 2606 authorizes USFA to  continue  its current operations and expand  training and research in a fiscally responsible  manner. The bill will provide firefighter training  to over 80,000 firefighters per year and facilitate the delivery of education and training programs to firefighters through local training efforts. S. 2606 also aids research  into  techniques, systems, and equipment  to  improve  fire prevention and control in sparsely developed communities that have been particularly  hard hit by fire in the past few years. This legislation also specifically addresses the issue of  fighting fires in an urban-wildland interface—  like the wildfires we saw last year in Southern  California—by implementing methods to better  respond and prepare for fires that move from  wildlands to suburban and urban areas.  As a physician,  I am particularly pleased  that S. 2606 includes language I offered in the  Science Committee  to  improve emergency  medical care by facilitating USFA’s coordination with other groups as well as its ability to  disseminate information on best-practices for  EMS operations and management.  Firefighters are called upon to extract victims  from car crashes, building  fires or collapses, and all other emergencies. It is critical  that patients  receive consistent care under  medical direction. While I do not expect USFA  to pursue studies into the medical care EMS  patients should receive, I believe that this language in S. 2606 will give the Administrator  the authority and flexibility to conduct studies  into training, system design, and on-scene patient management. This will allow the Administrator to work with appropriate federal agencies and existing medical services  in  these  local communities.  Mr. Speaker, it has been a great honor to  work with the men and women of our Nation’s  fire services—including the Congressional Fire  Services Institute, the International Association  of Fire Fighters, the International Association  of Fire Chiefs, and the National Volunteer Fire  Council—on  this  important  legislation. The  United States Fire Administration is a vital link  to these first responders and this agency has  made substantial contributions  to  improving  fire services throughout the country. S. 2606  will ensure  that USFA  remains vibrant and  productive in the years to come.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle  for  their  support and thoughtful contributions to this bill.  I urge passage of S. 2606 that will enable the  USFA to continue its record of achievement as  well as prepare firefighters for the challenges  they will face in the future.  ",2008
1435,59,2008-09-22,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2606, the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization.  Last year,  I was proud  to  introduce H.R.  4847, the House version of the U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization along with my colleague from Georgia, Dr. GINGREY. I voted for  and the House unanimously passed H.R. 4847  by a vote of 412 to zero on April 3, 2007.  Firefighters are often the first—and the last-  to  leave an emergency scene. Whether  it’s  putting out a house fire or a wildfire—or responding  to a  terrorist attack or a car accident—we depend on firefighters every day.  But firefighters also depend on us. They depend on the public and their elected officials to  make sure that they have the resources, the  equipment and  the  training  they need  to do  their job. Without those tools, we put them and  all of us at unnecessary risk.  The U.S. Fire Administration  is an  invaluable resource for our Nation’s firefighters and  the communities they protect. Through training, data collection, fire education for the public, and support for fire related research and  development, USFA provides critical tools and  leadership to the fire service. The resources  and leadership of USFA are an essential part  of the ability of the fire service to protect our  cities, towns, and communities.  Firefighters  today are called upon  to  respond  to an ever broader array of emergencies. This authorization bill gives USFA the  authority  to make sure  its  training program  keeps pace with the increasing challenges to  the fire service.  S. 2606 reauthorizes this important agency  for four years at funding levels that will enable  USFA to fully carry out its mission.  Last fall, the Science and Technology Committee’s Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation, of which I am a member, heard testimony about the priorities of the Nation’s fire  service community for USFA. This bill directly  reflects these priorities.  Fighting wildfires  in urban areas  requires  special training—and I’m proud that this legislation enhances Fire Administration training for  wildland-urban interface fires. In Arizona, one  of the toughest challenges our firefighters face  is wildfires in the wildland-urban interface.

1438,73,2008-09-22,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Well, thank  you very much.  I just want to commend and to thank  you, Representative CLARKE,  for the  leadership that you’ve taken on this  issue as well as on a number of others.  When you were elected, those of us who  knew of your history and who knew of  your  family’s history  in New York  were all delighted to know that we  were going to have a queen warrior join  us in the House of Representatives, and  that’s exactly what you have demonstrated yourself to be.  With every phone call that I have  gotten—and  I  represent  a  district  where the people like to be engaged  and where they like to be involved—  one of my biggest bills is probably my  phone bill. That’s because our phones  are constantly being used all the time,  all the time, all the time.  In practically every call that we have  gotten, the people have said,  ‘‘Don’t  fall for the okey-doke.’’ So, you know,  you have to ask them  ‘‘What is the  ’okey-doke’? What  are  you  talking  about? What are you asking us not to  fall for?’’ They’ll say, ‘‘Don’t fall for  any bailout plan that only bails out financial  institutions, that only bails  out financial investors, that only bails  out  sophisticated  traders,  that only  bails out people who really know and  who understand markets and who have  got all of these sophisticated tools and  all of this information. Make sure that  John Smith gets bailed out. Make sure  that Sally Jones gets bailed out. Make  sure that Mary Jackson gets bailed  out.’’  In essence, what they were saying is  make sure that, as to any bailout plan,  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:34 Sep 23, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K22SE7.136 H22SEPT1 E S U O H h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l e b j         ",2008
1439,80,2008-09-22,Mr. LATTA.," Well, when you’re talking about who’s going to be footing  this bill, the other things that scares  me is this. The reports out right now is  that China will become the number one  manufacturing country  in the world  next year. The United States, after  more  than  100  years,  is  getting  knocked off that hill as being number  one.  So as we are in a situation where the  taxpayers are being asked pretty much  again to step up, foot these bills, who  is going to pay it? Because the problem  is the jobs.  When I’m out at these factories in  my district, one of the things that I  ask the folks that are running the companies is, ‘‘Out of curiosity, how far do  your people drive in?’’ It’s not uncommon in my district that the people are  driving 50 miles one way to work.  Well, then you talk to the people out  on the floor, and they’re saying, ‘‘You  know what? If I have to drive 500 miles  a week, with gas prices as they are, is  it really worth it to me to actually  have this job, or should I try to find a  job some place closer to home?’’  Then the manager of the companies  then say, ‘‘If I lose these trained employees, where am I going to get the  people to run this plant? I’m going to  have to move it either across the country or out of the country.’’  It’s almost like the dog is chasing its  tail here. And we’ve got a real situation in this country where the people  out there don’t have the dollars  in  their pockets because they’re paying  more and more out.  We had that report not too long ago  that said we used about 41⁄2percent less  fuel and energy this past summer. That  was almost like a good news/bad news.  Good news is we have more fuel supply,  but the bad news is we had companies  not making product. We had people not  going places. We have a lot of places in  my area, the State of Ohio, especially  along Lake Erie—which is a huge tourist destination area—and a lot of people said, ‘‘You know what? We can’t  take that summer vacation this year.  We can’t go there.’’ So by them not  doing that, they didn’t help the local  tourist trade in our area.  So it’s a very tough situation. You  know, when other countries are out  there, they’re exploring. As you pointed out as we were talking about oil  shale that 2.1 trillion barrels, trillion  barrels. And you’re absolutely right;  we are the Saudi Arabia when it comes  to oil shale.  At the same time you have got the  Chinese and the Indians and the French  and a  lot of other countries  in the  world right now are out there producing energy. And you have got China  in the next 25 to 30 years, they’re probably going to build 40 nuclear power  plants. The Indians are going to be  building another 25 to 30 in the next 25  years. You  have  the French. The  French right now are at least 75 percent nuclear. They have enough power  that they can export that power into  Europe.  And here in this country we’ve got a  situation where they’re saying, ‘‘What  are we going to do in the future? What  have we done?’’ You know, the last nuclear power plant site in this country  was 1977. Last one to go on line was in  1996. That’s a crisis.  ",2008
1440,80,2008-09-22,Mrs. BACHMANN.," It’s a crisis, and if  the gentleman would yield.  It seems that our energy policy right  now is being determined by bureaucracy and by socialistic tendencies, not  by  the  free market.  It’s  imperative  that people have the ability to choose  the energy needs that they have.  Here in the State of Minnesota, the  people that I represent, they’re all very  soon going to be turning their thermostats up. Some homes are heated by  natural gas, some by fuel oil. And we’re  going to be looking potentially at dramatic spikes  in costs  for people on  their fuel oil and home energy heating.  People  in Minnesota don’t have a  choice. They have to turn on their fuel.

1441,87,2008-09-22,Mr. MCNULTY.," I thank my friend.  And for anyone who is listening tonight, you have seen ample demonstration of why I am such a grateful person, all of these wonderful friends. No  one could have a better friend in the  world  than GARY ACKERMAN. And  I  want to thank him, and Representatives  ARCURI, ISRAELand HALL for the many  CROWLEY,  HINCHEY,  LOWEY,  kind things that they have said tonight  about me and the members of my family.  I want to thank, of course, all of the  members of the New York delegation,  and also my dear friend the Speaker  pro tem, my buddy, Jason, for his very  kind words. I shall always be grateful  for having been a member of our State  delegation, chaired by CHARLIERANGEL. I am grateful to all of my Democratic colleagues.  I am grateful to all of my Republican  colleagues,  especially JIMMYWALSH,  who is a classmate of mine in the class  of 1988, along with NITALOWEY, and JIM  is also retiring this year.  I am grateful to all of those with  whom I have served through the years,  all of the Speakers, from Jim Wright to  NANCYPELOSI, and all of the Republican leaders, from Bob Michel to JOHN  BOEHNER. And I am grateful to all of  the staff of this great institution for  the wonderful work that they do for us  each and every day.  I have been truly blessed in my life.  Paralyzed by polio in 1949, God eventually granted me a near complete recovery. And  just  look at my  life since  then. I have been blessed with a large  and  loving  family, many wonderful  friends, and a career that I have thoroughly enjoyed for 39 years, as town supervisor, as mayor. And as one of my  colleagues back home said, and it is  true,  there  is nothing more  special  than  being  elected mayor  of  your  hometown.  b2215  Then to go to the New York State  Assembly for 6 years, and then 20 years  here in the United States Congress, and  Steve is right, when I am walking outside and I see the dome lit up at night,  I still pinch myself that I am here,  MIKEMCNULTY, an average guy, from  Green  Island, New York, population  2,500. When I was a young public official, I had a dream. This was it, my  dream came true.  I am especially grateful to my family, as others have pointed out, my wife  of 37 years, Nancy; and our daughters,  Michele, Angela, Nancy and Maria. I  am especially grateful to them for the  many sacrifices that they made so that  I could pursue this career in public life,  and all those of you who have families  know what I am talking about. Thank  you to our grandchildren, Teigin and  Elijah, Lola, Morgyn and Daniel, for  the joy they bring to us each and every  day.  I send out a special message of love  to Teigin tonight. She is in the hospital, and, hopefully, she will be right  back in action very soon.  She was so proud to be here, standing  right there in that spot at the beginning of this Congress, holding my hand  when I stood up and voted to elect the  first woman to serve as the Speaker of  the United States House of Representatives. That was a very special moment  for me, for the country and for Teigin.  So I have special thoughts for Teigin  tonight.  I am grateful to the others that you  have mentioned, my mom and dad, and  all of those who went before us, all the  members of my family and to Frank  and Lola Lazzaro, all the members of  Nancy’s great family, for their steadfast support all through the years.  As I look back on my life, I look forward to the challenges that lie ahead,  but up to this point, I just have to acknowledge how much has been given to  me. I have to acknowledge all of the  lucky breaks that I have had in my life  and in my career.  In  thankfulness and gratitude  for  that, I have tried, to the best of my  ability, to give back. I shall always endeavor for the rest of my life to live according to the fundamental principle  that life is to give, not to take.  ",2008

We will be up to visit. Can’t say that  we are drinking buddies, Mike, but we  are certainly eating buddies, take-out  in good restaurants up your way.  Come down here and back into the  city. We will be putting together a  group of guys and gals just to hang out.  ",2008
1443,87,2008-09-22,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate my colleague and dear  friend  Representative MIKEMCNULTYon his upcoming retirement, and compliment his two decades of honorable service in the House, and  nearly 40 years serving in elected office. His  absence  from  the House will be  felt, and  I  wish him happiness and success for the future  and the successes it is sure to bring.  For 20 years Congressman MCNULTY has  served his New York district with integrity and  the utmost concern  for his constituents and  their communities. In his nearly 40 years serving  those communities, MICHAEL has always  advocated for intelligent and just solutions to  the issues that touch his constituent’s lives. As  a mayor and New York State Legislator, Congressman MCNULTY advocated  for  improvements in substance-abuse education and prevention and fought for his communities’ infrastructure and economic  improvements. As a  member of the House he has continued this  advocacy on not only local issues, but humanitarian as well. He has been a  leader on  issues of human rights, hunger, poverty, and  international affairs.  In 2006, MIKEwas  re-  elected with nearly 78 percent of the vote, a  well-deserved affirmation by his constituents of  a job and career well done.  Congressman MCNULTY is a fairminded and  level-headed individual who brought a wealth  of experience and insight to his seat as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security.  His character is one of deliberate and thoughtful decision making, based on insight and a  true understanding of his district and our country. He is an ever dependable friend and a colleague I greatly respect.  I had the opportunity to serve last year with  MIKEas a Helsinki Commissioner, and visited  Kyiv, working to further address continued humanitarian issues there. His work, our discussions and the successes we walked away with  were exemplary of his high  level of understanding and his personal attention  to  the  challenges that the people of the region continue to face.

1469,108,2008-09-22,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President,  I  want to speak about this bailout we  have been asked to do. Starting last  week, we were told by the powers that  be in the Bush administration we needed to do a $700 billion bailout to stabilize our economy.  When we heard that, Americans became scared. People who save for their  retirement, those who have been faithful  in paying their mortgage, those  who have worked hard to pay for college, are wondering what is going on.  People who have worked hard  and  played by the rules are wondering, are  they being asked to bail out those who  did not? Americans are mad as hell and  they want to know what about them.  They watched Wall Street executives  pay themselves  lavish salaries. They  watched them do irresponsible lending  practices. They watched them do casino  gambling  on  risky  investment  mechanisms. And now those very same  Americans  who  worked  hard  and  played by the rules, were prudent investors, prudent savers, prudent citizens, are asked to pay the bill for those  who did not.  Now,  it  is  for those people that I  know the Government must do something. We must protect our economy  and we must protect our way of life  and we must protect our middle class.  Sure, the economy is in a crisis. And,  yes, we do have a credit crisis. Wall  Street did make very bad decisions.  But now they are asking Main Street  to pay the bill. We must act to restore  our confidence in our economy. I agree,  we must act promptly. But this Senator will not be stampeded into voting  for this Bush administration bill.  So far during the last 7 years, every  time there is a crisis, they generate  fear and they generate bad ideas. Do  you remember after the horrific days of  9/11 when we all came to the floor and  pledged our patriotism? I said, we needed to put politics aside because we  needed to be the red, white, and blue  party. Well, they took advantage of  that. And in that process we passed  something like the PATRIOT Act, allowing our Government to act with  undue secrecy with no parameters. We  created the dysfunctional Department  of Homeland Security.  Now we are being asked to deal with  the fiscal crisis and the financial crisis.  I am concerned we are going to create  a fiscal FEMA. We must act with resolve, but we cannot be a rubberstamp  for the administration’s proposal. This  proposal gives sweeping authority to  those who were asleep at the switch in  the first place.  Remember the Fed? Remember the  maestro at the Fed who plunged down  interest rates, and now helped create  the housing bubble? Then there is the  Treasury. There is the Secretary of the  Treasury. A couple of months ago he  said, no problem—like our President  ‘‘fundamentally sound.’’  Then a couple of months later they  said, oh, there is a problem. And we  have lurched from one bailout to another: Bear Stearns,  the  insurance  company, oh, no, not to Lehman, then  after that failed, so we have gone from  ‘‘no problem’’ to lurching around, to  now $700 billion and a blank check.  We have  seen  those George Bush  plans before. Now this one is a three-  page bill. It gives the Secretary of the  Treasury unlimited power to intervene  in our financial markets without any  review  by  Congress,  agencies,  or  courts. They make the Secretary of the  Treasury a financial czar, a financial  potentate, because it says: Give us a  blank check with no balances.  Well, I say: No checks without balances. Even the President of the United  States of America has to come to us to  declare war. I believe the Secretary of  the Treasury should be accountable to  the Congress and to whether mechanisms—if he is going to intervene with  $700 billion in his pocket. I say no regulations without  any  safeguards. No  way. No blank check. There must be  regulations. There best be safeguards.  If they do not want regulation, no way.  If they do not want safeguards, no way.  We are in uncharted waters, so we  need to ask tough questions. First, how  do we know it will work? What guarantees are there it will work? Could this  bankrupt our Treasury because it has  no parameters? Could it cause runaway  inflation,  further  eroding our  economy? What are the safeguards?  Also, who is going to benefit? Is it  going to be the same Wall Street go-go  guy, the same Wall Street casino types  who are going to benefit now? Whatever we do, we have to insist that those  who created this scandal do not benefit  from the bailout: no golden parachutes.  Let them feel the hard landing that  my constituents faced when they were  laid off at Bethlehem Steel. Let them  feel the hard landing of what it is like  to have your mortgage foreclosed upon.  Let them feel the hard landing my constituents are facing right now. We do  not need to subsidize bad behavior.  Now George Bush said he was the  first MBA President. Well, hello, I do  not have confidence in this administration. Remember, this was the same  crowd that brought us Katrina, FEMA,  and ‘‘hey, you are doing a good job,  Brownie.’’  Well, is this what we are now supposed to say to those who are managing our finances? I don’t think so.  We also have to prudently ask ourselves, are there better alternatives?  Let me be clear: I do believe we need to  act promptly but with safeguards. We  need to act with resolve, but we need  to have regulation and even retribution. If we have stabilization, which I  believe we must do, we must also have  reform. We are all looking at the administration’s plan, but I want everyone to know where I stand. At a minimum, the plan must, first, be limited  and  temporary.  It  cannot be open-  ended. There also must be a plan for  those who have had those hard landings on Main Street. We need to put  people first, to keep people in their  homes, those who have had some of the  most  significant mortgage  payment  challenges, no golden parachutes that  reward  top executives  for  their excesses,  their  recklessness, and  their  sheer stupidity and greed, no blank  checks. There must be accountability  and oversight. Rescue does require reform, regulation, and a strong possibility of retribution. It must be transparent. I am for prompt action, but I  will not be stampeded the way I have  been stampeded in this institution by  this administration in the past.  We need to make sure we do it right.  That means not handing over a blank  check or getting rid of the balances.  We have to ask tough questions and be  sure we have the right principles. If  not, then the taxpayers will be on the  hook. If we make the wrong decisions,  taxpayers will be on the hook not only  for Wall Street’s bad decisions, but I  don’t want to set this up for Government’s bad decisions. We need to get  Government back on the side of the  people who need it. We need to put the  public good over private profits. This  means we need to take a look at a 21st  century regulatory system. I am tired  of  seeing  this  laxity where what  emerges when we deregulate  is  the  emergence of sharks and whales. Either  way, the minnows get swallowed up.  We don’t want our economy to sink,  and I think it is time to swim. But  when we do, we need to make sure we  are asking the right questions. We need  to fight for the middle class. We need  to fight for the people who go by the  rules. We need to have a legislative  framework that rewards those who did  their very best and might be having a  temporary spill.  I look forward to hearing more about  this plan, but right now I need to know  more. I need to be reassured more, and  I need to be absolutely sure that those  who created the crisis don’t benefit  from it and we don’t leave the middle  class with all of the responsibility.  I yield the floor.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  CARDIN). The Senator from Virginia.  ",2008

1471,122,2008-09-22,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. President, I wish  to say a few words on the crisis about  which everyone in America is talking.  My phones, both in Vermont and here  in Washington, have been bouncing off  the hook with people who are outraged  about the prospect of the middle class  bailing out Wall Street. They are telling me: No way; we should not be doing  that.  The current  financial crisis  facing  our country should, in fact, put an end  to almost any support for the extreme  rightwing economic policies President  Bush has been pursuing for the last 8  years and that, in fact, were pursued  even before that.  These  policies  include,  of  course,  huge tax breaks for the very rich under  the guise that that money will trickle  on down to ordinary people and create  a prosperous nation. That certainly has  not been the case.  Those policies include unfettered free  trade, which says it is a good thing for  corporate America to be able to throw  American workers out on the street,  move to China, and bring those products back into this country and run up  what is now over a $600 billion-a-year  trade deficit.  Last but not least, and pertinent to  the great financial crisis we are facing  right now—a crisis which many people  believe is the most serious financial  problem this country has had since the  Great Depression of 1929—is the whole  of deregulation, not only of financial  services but of energy and many other  sectors  in our  economy, under  the  guise that we should have great faith  in  large  financial  institutions,  that  they will do the right thing and that  they will benefit  the people of our  country and, in fact, the world.  We have learned tax breaks for the  rich do not filter down but make the  rich richer. We have learned unfettered  free trade costs us millions of good-  paying jobs. We have learned that massive deregulation, allowing large financial institutions to do whatever they  want to do under the radar screen, will  only hurt our economy and maybe  drive it to ruin.  In the midst of all this, it is important to understand what has been going  on for ordinary people in this country.  Since President Bush has been in office, nearly 6 million Americans have  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:21 Mar 19, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€8SENATE\S22SE8.REC S22SE8 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2008
1472,129,2008-09-22,Mr. CORNYN.," Mr. President, today I  commend James Ketelsen for his vision  and commitment to transforming the  hopes of tens of thousands of students  and  families  across  the  country  through Project GRAD, an education  reform program that he started when  he was chairman and CEO of Tenneco  in Houston, TX. Project GRAD has  helped these students realize their academic potential and many of  them  have completed their college education  with the assistance of Project GRAD  scholarships  and mentoring  support  from Project GRAD staff.  Project GRAD evolved from a scholarship program that began under Mr.  Ketelsen’s  leadership at Tenneco.  In  1988, the company began to fund a 4-  year scholarship program for eligible  graduates of Davis High School, at the  time Houston’s lowest-performing high  school. By 1992, the number of Davis  graduates entering college had more  than  quadrupled. Still, high  school  graduation rates and college matriculation rates continued to fall short of  Mr. Ketelsen’s  expectations. He believed that Davis students—and all students from economically disadvantaged  communities—were  capable of much  more  if given the right  investments  and the right commitment. ‘‘It’s not  the kids!’’ he insisted. Armed with that  belief, Mr. Ketelsen has dedicated the  last two decades to making an enormous difference for America’s highest  needs students.  Today, Project GRAD has expanded  to 13 communities and reaches more  than 120,000 students and families from  California  to New York, Alaska  to  Georgia. In the longest-served group of  schools, GRAD scholars are completing  college at a rate 92 percent above the  national  average  for  students  from  similar demographic backgrounds. A  statistically  significant  sample  of  GRAD scholarship recipients who have  completed college shows that the proportion who graduated with majors in  science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics—concentrations  of  dire  need for the national economy and national security—exceeded the national  average  for minority students by 71  percent. In the coming academic year,  more than 7,500 students will attend  college,  funded by a Project GRAD  scholarship. GRAD has already sent  high school graduates to more than 100  institutions of higher education,  including many of the most highly selective colleges and universities  in the  Nation. At  the  beginning  of  high  school, many Project GRAD students  would never have dreamed of attending  Rice, the University of Texas, Texas A  & M, Harvard, Yale, MIT, Cornell,  Emory, Georgetown, or the University  of Virginia. Yet, Mr. Ketelsen’s Texas-  sized vision, determination, and  remarkable leadership of Project GRAD  have transformed those expectations.  I am grateful for the energy and enthusiasm with which Mr Ketelsen has  served America’s children and families.  Recently, Mr. Ketelsen announced his  decision to step down from his post as  chairman of the board of directors for  Project GRAD USA. Although he is retiring  from Project GRAD USA, he  plans to remain active with the Houston chapter of Project GRAD. I join  with my colleagues in saluting James  Ketelsen for his efforts to improve education  and  career  opportunities  for  children in inner-city schools. The return on his investment in education  will  continue  for  generations  to  come.∑  f  A-H-S-T COMMUNITY EDUCATION  ∑",2008
1473,129,2008-09-22,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, in Iowa  and across the United States, a new  school year has begun. As you know,  Iowa public schools have an excellent  reputation nationwide, and Iowa students’ test scores are among the highest in the Nation.  I would like to take just a few minutes, today, to salute the dedicated  teachers, administrators, and  school  board members in the A-H-S-T Community School District, and to report on  their participation in a unique Federal  partnership to repair and modernize  school facilities.  This fall marks the 10th year of the  Iowa  Demonstration  Construction  Grant Program. That  is  its  formal  name, but it is better known among  educators in Iowa as the program of  Harkin grants for Iowa public schools.  Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 million  for the  State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school districts to receive  these grants for a range of renovation  and repair effort—everything from updating fire safety systems to building  new schools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal  funding is used to leverage public and/  or private local funding, so it often has  a tremendous multiplier effect  in a  local school district.  The A-H-S-T Community School District received a 2005 Harkin grant totaling $500,000 which it used to help  build a new elementary school. This  school is a modern, state-of-the-art facility that befits the educational ambitions and excellence of this school district. Indeed, it is the kind of school facility that every child in America deserves.  Excellent schools do not just pop up  like mushrooms after a rain. They are  the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a tremendous amount of  collaboration among local officials and  concerned citizens. I salute the entire  staff, administration, and governance  in the A-H-S-T Community School District, which serves the towns of Avoca,  Hancock, Shelby and Tenant. In particular, I would like to recognize the  leadership of the board of education—  Greg Becker, Monte Reisgard, Allen  Cordes, and Lauri Fell and  former  members John Pattee, Mark Schroder,  Sondra Dea, Gene McCool and Darlene  McMartin. I would also like to recognize superintendent Mike Alexander,  former  superintendent Chuck Scott  and business manager Nancy Collins.  As we mark the 10th anniversary of  the Harkin school grant program  in  Iowa, I am obliged to point out that  many  thousands of  school buildings  and facilities across the United States  are in dire need of renovation or replacement. In my State of Iowa alone,  according to a recent study, some 79  percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The harsh reality is  that the average age of school buildings in the United States is nearly 50  years.  Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming  sports arenas on weekends, but during  the week go to school in rundown or  antiquated  facilities. This  sends exactly the wrong message to our young  people about our priorities. We have to  do better.

1474,143,2008-09-22,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce the Vision Preservation Act of 2008 with my colleague  Sen. GEORGEVOINOVICH. The goal of  this legislation is to help Americans  avoid the personal tragedy of unnecessary, preventable vision loss. This important legislation is supported by Prevent Blindness America, the American  Foundation for the Blind, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, and  the American Optometric Association  Right now there are an estimated 80  million Americans suffering from potentially blinding eye disease. Three  million more Americans struggle with  low vision. 1.1 million more are legally  blind. Glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy,  cataract and age-related macular degeneration, AMD,  and  other  vision  problems are costing tens of thousands  of people in the United States their  ability to see each year. With the aging  baby boom generation moving toward  retirement age, these numbers are expected to grow considerably. It is estimated that by 2030, the number of blind  and visually impaired people will double if nothing is done.  Unsurprisingly,  ‘‘The Economic Impact of Vision Problems: The Toll of  Major Adult Eye Disorders, Visual Impairment, and Blindness on the U.S.  Economy,’’ a study conducted by Prevent Blindness America, reveals that  vision loss carries significant cost to  individuals,  private  insurers, health  care providers, and the Federal government.

Craig began as a seasonal employee in the  summers of 1969 and 1970 with the Marshall  County Conservation Board. In 1971, he applied for a maintenance position that opened  up and was offered  the position. Craig kept  the area parks, wildlife areas, prairies, river  access sites and trails maintained for the public use. During his years at the Conservation  Board, Craig’s hard work has earned him respect and appreciation from citizens and visitors around the region.  I commend Craig Rhodes  for his many  years of  loyalty and service  to his  fellow  Iowans. It is an honor to represent Craig in the  United States Congress, and I know my colleagues join me in wishing him a happy and  healthy retirement.  f  HONORING TIM MOREHOUSE  HON. ELIOT L.

1481,157,2008-09-22,Mr. ENGEL.," Madam Speaker, Tim Morehouse combines the discipline of an Olympic  medalist with  the generosity of  spirit  that  makes him a  teacher  in one of our poorer  neighborhoods.  As a member of  the United States sabre  team, Tim won a Silver Medal at the Beijing  Olympics.  He began fencing in seventh grade at Riverdale Country Day School, and switched to the  sabre from the foil in the eighth grade. His skill  got him  recruited by Brandeis University  in  Waltham, Massachusetts. There he became  one of the top college fencers in the country,  qualifying for the NCAA championships three  times.  At Brandeis, Tim was a history major and  served as a resident adviser for 2 years. After  graduating, he became a part of Teach  for  America, an education consortium that aims to  bridge the achievement gap between different  socio-economic groups. Morehouse went  to  Intermediate School 90 in Washington Heights  as a 7th-grade English and social studies  teacher.  As a  former  teacher  I am proud of Tim  Morehouse  for his abilities as an Olympian,  but even more so for his dedication to helping  others. He is an example of the scholar-athlete who, having achieved his goals,  then  helps others to achieve theirs.  We are proud of Tim Morehouse. To be an  Olympian takes dedication and training, and a  lot of both. It takes a different kind of dedication to devote your life to helping others. I congratulate Tim for being superb on both counts.  CONGRATULATING  HURST  MAIN  POST OFFICE AS A VOLUNTARY  PROTECTION  PROGRAM  STAR  SITE  HON. MICHAEL C.

The distinction as a  ‘‘Star’’ site displays  Hurst Main Post Office’s sustained excellence  in all areas of safety and health management  systems. This excellence stems  from strong  leadership, participation, and commitment  to  quality.  I commend the Hurst Main Post Office upon  their receipt of this distinction for their commitment to exercising safe and healthful working  conditions. Their efforts serve as an example  to all, and I am proud to be their representative in the 26th District of Texas.  f  HONORING MAXWELL BOWERS  HON.

1485,164,2008-09-22,Mr. FARR.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  call attention  to  the 6th Annual Sea Otter  Awareness Week, September 22–28, 2008,  sponsored  by Defenders  of Wildlife. This  weeklong event provides  the opportunity  to  educate the broader public about sea otters,  their natural history, the integral role that sea  otters play  in  the near-shore marine ecosystem, and the conservation issues they are  facing.  In the early 1700s, before wide-scale hunting began, sea otters ranged across the North  Pacific rim from Japan to Baja, California. The  worldwide population estimates  for  that  time  range from the hundreds of thousands to possibly a million or more. Before  the hunting  began,  there were  approximately  16,000–  20,000 along California’s coast. Killing these  animals for their fur brought down their numbers until they were thought to be extinct off  California by the early 1900s.  But they were not driven completely to extinction. In the 1930s a small population, less  than 100, was discovered  that had escaped  the hunt in a remote cove on a coastal ranch  in Big Sur on the central coast of California.  Since that time, groups such as Defenders of  Wildlife, Friends of  the Sea Otter, and The  Ocean Conservancy have raised public awareness and helped protect this important species  under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and  the Endangered Species Act.  The presence of the California sea otter has  become an icon of the State’s coastal environment and culture, and these charismatic animals bring significant tourism revenue to Californian coastal communities. The spring census conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey  this year counted 2,760 animals, down 8.8  percent  from  last year, and  their  range extends along the central coast from Half Moon  Bay to Pt. Conception.  These numbers are significantly  less  than  what is necessary to consider the population  stable and  their population growth  in recent  years is slower than their cousins in Alaska.  Researchers are beginning to identify indirect  hazards  for  sea otters  such as non-point  source pollution, pathogens, and entrapment  in fisheries’ gear that are causing their population growth to slow. Such realizations support the need for continued research and preventive measures to respond to these issues,  while continuing  to ward against  the direct  killings/takings that still occur.  The decline of southern sea otters off the  California coast not only impacts the species  itself, but  it affects other marine populations  and  the  surrounding ecosystem. They are  what scientists refer to as a keystone species.  This means that they are integrally important  to the ecosystem in which they live. For example, the demise of sea otters allows their prey,  sea urchins,  to proliferate unchecked, which  leads  to  the alarming overgrazing of kelp  beds—one of the ocean’s nursery grounds for  many marine animals. In particular, research  shows that the absence of sea otters has a direct link to the sharp decline of kelp along portions of California’s coast.  The sea otter is also what scientists refer to  as a sentinel or an indicator species. In this  way,  the sea otters are  the canaries  in  the  coal mine for our coastal health. The sea otters are all too effective at monitoring toxins  and  diseases  in  the marine  environment,  which can affect  the health of humans and  other wildlife.  California has taken the first step toward addressing these emerging concerns by signing  into law California Assembly Bill 2485, which  establishes a State  fund  for sea otter conservation. Again this year Californians had the  option of donating a portion of their tax returns  to sea otter conservation. I want to emphasize  that  this means  that Californians voluntarily  pay a  little more on  their  tax return  to help  protect these animals. To date, this has raised  almost $270,000.  However, this is a federally protected species and California cannot go it alone. In addition to working with my colleagues to secure  Federal  funds  to support a continued and  complete recovery of  the population,  I  introduced H.R. 3639, the southern sea otter Recovery and Research Act. Earlier this year, the  Subcommittee  on  Fisheries, Wildlife,  and  Oceans held a hearing about the southern sea  otter and  the management of  these populations.  Dr. James Estes from the University of California, Santa Cruz; Andrew Johnson, from the  Monterey Bay Aquarium; and Jim Curland  from Defenders of Wildlife  testified on  the  state of the sea otter populations. I and my  colleagues have sought their knowledge and  expertise, along with other Federal, State, and  local experts and citizens  to provide  for research and recovery programs for the southern sea otter.  Madam Speaker,  I applaud  the many accomplishments of Defenders of Wildlife, who  carry out  the  important mission  to preserve  our Nation’s wildlife and habitat. I also applaud  the other non-profit environmental organizations, working with the Monterey Bay Aquarium, researchers,  fishermen, State and Federal agencies, schools, and many other institutions and individuals, who devote tremendous  effort to protect and recover the southern California sea otter. Sea Otter Awareness Week is  just one of  their many activities geared  towards honoring and saving this species, and I  am proud to be associated with this vital work.  f  HONORING JUDGE HAROLD  BAREFOOT SANDERS, JR.

1486,164,2008-09-22,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas.,"  Madam Speaker, today I mourn the passing of  one of my political heroes, the legendary U.S.  District Judge Harold Barefoot Sanders, Jr.  Madam Speaker, Judge Sanders  is best  known for overseeing a desegregation plan for  the Dallas  Independent School District  from  the 1980s until 2003. Judge Sanders also directed the overhaul of state schools for mentally retarded people and served as a legislative counsel to President Lyndon Johnson.  Madam Speaker,  from  his  core,  Judge  Sanders symbolized civil rights. He knew that  fairness took work, and his diligence is why he  was able to make history and inspire a generation of my Texas colleagues. As an assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice, he was credited with helping pass  the  Voting Rights Act of 1965. As a Texas legislator, he helped write the Texas Mental Health  Code. And as a federal judge, in a ruling that  I believe took more courage than any other,  he declared Dallas’ segregated schools illegal.  Madam Speaker, President John F. Kennedy appointed Judge Sanders as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas in 1961.

1487,2,2008-09-30,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, I  think the majority leader set precisely  the right tone. I, too, want to reassure  the American people that we intend to  pass this legislation this week. We will  pass  it on a broad bipartisan basis,  both sides cooperating, to prevent this  financial crisis from persisting.  The message from the markets yesterday was clear. The time for finger-  pointing indeed has come to an end. As  the  senior Senator  from Tennessee  likes to remind us, this is not the time  to fix the blame, this is the time to fix  the problem. Those also are the words  of Senator MCCAIN, with whom I spoke  yesterday, who is in exactly the same  place as all of us are on a bipartisan  basis.  So we will get the job done, we will  get  it done this week, and I think,  hopefully, that will reassure the American people that Congress can rise to  the occasion—act like grownups, if you  will—and get the job done for all of our  people.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.  f  TRIBUTE TO SENATORS  PETEDOMENICI  ",2008
1488,2,2008-09-30,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, a lot of people  think  they know Senator PETE  DOMENICI DOMENICI. They know him as a man  who has been a leader in the Senate for  decades on energy issues, and he was  the chairman of that committee, and  on budget issues, and he has been the  chairman of that committee. He is a  man who has been a leader on the Appropriations Committee. I have known  Senator DOMENICI in that regard, as  have the American people, but what I  think  is  so  interesting about PETE  is a side that a lot of people  don’t know about him. Here is a man  who can talk about Wall Street, he can  talk about financial markets, he can  talk about the budgetary problems facing this country, but in a personal, private conversation, he can talk about  baseball.  Here is a man who was a star athlete.  He was a great baseball player. As a  young man, he played American Legion  Baseball.  I played American Legion  Baseball, but PETE’s team was good.  Mine wasn’t so good. PETEled his team  to the regional championship.  American Legion Baseball used to be  the baseball for young men.  They did not have all the State tournaments they had in high schools, so in  the summer, the best athletes would  get together, the best baseball players  would get together and play American  Legion ball, and the winter regional  championship was significant.  Senator DOMENICIwent on to letter  all 4 years, of course, in high school. He  was a standout pitcher for the University of New Mexico, and he was All  Conference. His  final year he had a  record of 14 and 3. That  is quite a  record. In those days, when Senator  DOMENICIwas in high school and college, they would play a lot of games, as  they do now. A record of 14 and 3 is a  very significant record.  But that was not the end of his career. He went on to play professional  baseball. After college he played for  the hometown crowd as a left-handed  pitcher for the Albuquerque Dukes. I  know he must have had a great fastball  and a great curveball to accomplish  what he did in baseball. But in the Senate, PETE does not  throw  curveballs, it is the high hard one all  the time. He is a person who tells people how he feels.  With my long-time relationship with  Senator DOMENICI, I only had one problem my  entire  career with  DOMENICI. That was a time when—I,  frankly, do not remember whether I  was the ranking member of the subcommittee or the chairman of the subcommittee because we went back and  forth often. That was the Energy and  Water  Subcommittee  of Appropriations.  As a relatively young Senator, I had  a position of power, and I thought what  I would do is go and talk to members of  that conference and get the votes. I did  it very quietly. I did not say a word to  Senator DOMENICI. I surprised everybody. I called for a vote unexpectedly  and I won. Senator DOMENICI did not  say a word to me there publicly. Well,  DOMENICI PETE  when that was over, we had a little  heart-to-heart talk. He said: We have  to work together. If we are going to  work together on this subcommittee, I  want to tell you something about how  we do things in the Senate. We do not  surprise each other. If you had a problem with that issue, talk to me. If you  have the votes, you do not need to try  to embarrass me publicly, you go ahead  and do what you need to do.  I  learned a great  lesson  there.  I  learned a lesson that can only come by  someone teaching you, such as when I  practiced law. It is not pleasant to talk  about, but you learn from your mistakes in the practice of law. When you  make a mistake, you never do that  again. As a result of the teaching moment I had with Senator DOMENICI, I  never, ever did that again. So I appreciate, if for no other reason than that,  that one experience with PETEDOMENICI. It made me a better Senator and a  better person.  It was very clear that when Senator  DOMENICIrealized he would not be playing for the New York Yankees, even  though he was a good athlete, he decided he would become a teacher. Then  he went to law school, and after graduating, PETEDOMENICIentered politics.  First, he was elected to the city commission  in  Albuquerque.  Then  he  climbed up that ladder of local politics  and became mayor of Albuquerque and  was elected in 1972 as a young man to  the Senate.  My relationship with Senator DOMENICIbegan, my first experience coming  to the Senate, in 1986. I was very fortunate that year. I was a brand-new Senator. I got on the Appropriations Committee. As we now know, Senators wait  a long time to get on that committee.  I was so fortunate that BARBARAMIKULSKIand HARRYREID, two brand-new  Senators, were placed on that committee. From that day, I got to know  PETEDOMENICI.  My experience on the Appropriations  Committee goes back to the day that  John Stennis, the Senator from Mississippi, was chairman of that committee. By the time I got to the Senate, he was in very frail health. He had  been shot in a robbery, he had lost a  leg, he had cancer. So he was very  weak.  His chief of staff was a man by the  name of John Sullivan. He had been  chief of staff of the Judiciary Committee, Armed Services Committee,  now  the Appropriations Committee.  And he called me. After I met Senator  Stennis, he called me in his office and  said to me: Senator REID, you got on  the best committee in the entire Senate. He said: You can do a lot of good  things for your State, but do not be  greedy.  That was a real good lesson for me. I  have always tried to follow that. Senator DOMENICIhas been someone I have  worked with on that committee. I did  not immediately get on the Energy and  Water Subcommittee. It takes a while  to get on that.

The  roots  of Barter Theatre  are  found in what it calls ‘‘a unique beginning,’’ during a time in our Nation’s  history when many Americans, including Virginians, were focused on financial woes. It was the Great Depression,  and  a  young man  named  Robert  Porterfield was inspired by providing  theater tickets to the many and not  just to those who could afford them. It  was the  idea of bartering goods  for  services that served as the foundation  for this successful endeavor and earned  Porterfield’s theater its name.  By trading goods for theater tickets,  Porterfield was able to fill the seats of  his theater. The price of admission was  40 cents, but if you had no money to  spare, you could bring the equivalent  in produce. Whether it was vegetables,  dairy products, or a chicken, if it was  worth 40 cents, it was worth entrance.  The idea of bartering goods for services  is by no means a unique idea, but it is  an idea that allowed many Virginians  the opportunity to enjoy the arts. The  idea of trading ‘‘ham for Hamlet,’’ as  Barter Theatre calls it, was a success,  a success that allowed the theater to  endure to today.  In 1946, the Virginia General Assembly designated Barter Theatre as the  State Theatre of Virginia, the first theater in the Commonwealth of Virginia  to receive this distinction, and rightly  so. The excellence of Barter reaches far  beyond the lengthy list of famous actors who have graced its stage throughout its years and touches more on its  efforts to enrich and enhance the culture of our Commonwealth.  The impact of this historic theater  does not go unnoticed  in southwest  Virginia, as it has continually aimed to  increase levels of artistic development  in the region. Each year, Barter Theatre’s Appalachian Festival of Plays and  Playwrights showcases and honors Appalachian history and culture for all to  see upon its stage. I also want to recognize the efforts of Barter Theatre as  they  continue  educational  outreach  programs to Virginia’s youth. Several  programs,  such as  the Young Playwrights Festival, the Internet Distance  Learning Program, the Student Matinee Program, and the theatre’s touring company, are in place and continue  to  foster  creativity  through  playwrighting and theatrical performances.  I must note that Barter Theatre remains true to its humble beginnings  and pays homage to  its history. At  least one performance a year  celebrates the Barter heritage by accepting  donations for an area food bank as the  price of admission. An endeavor rooted  in the ideals of community continues  to give back to that community today.  I am pleased by the passage of H.  Con. Res. 416, and I thank my colleagues in joining me in support of this  resolution.  ",2008

1500,30,2008-09-30,Mr. DORGAN.," That is correct. My  point was, that which has occurred  that has caused this unbelievable collapse, I think the Senator from New  Mexico would agree that what has precipitated this is the massive amount of  failure out there of mortgage-backed  securities that are held on the balance  sheets of these financial institutions.  They turned out to be sour. It has  begun to pull down on some of these institutions.  My point was that you can go to the  Internet today and you can find exactly the same kind of irresponsible  advertising  that  existed  for a  long  time, including the biggest mortgage  bank  in  the  country, Countrywide,  which is saying: Bad credit, come over  here, we will give you a loan. The same  things exists. Go to the Internet today,  and you will find exactly the same kind  of advertising.  ",2008
1501,30,2008-09-30,Mr. DOMENICI., I think Countrywide  has been taken over by Bank of America.  ,2008
1502,30,2008-09-30,Mr. DORGAN., It has.  ,2008
1503,30,2008-09-30,Mr. DOMENICI.," Let me say to the  Senator—and I am giving you an observation—what has happened, it seems to  me, in terms of our efforts to pass a  rescue package is that we started out  by talking about a bailout—somebody  did—and also, at the same time, a Wall  Street bailout. You know, what caught  my eye as a Senator wondering whether I was going to help with this, until  I found out that there was no bailout  and Wall Street was not being bailed  out, what was happening was—well,  let’s take the biggest purveyor of mortgage-backed securities, and that happened to be Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac. They had most of them. What  they really were, were mortgages on  homes that people bought by the hundreds of thousands. As a matter of fact,  those  two  entities  have mortgaged  more than half, well over half—almost  two-thirds  of  all American  houses.  They had taken these mortgage-backed  securities and they were selling them.  That is how they made this inordinate  amount of money over the last 10 or 12  years. Then what happened  is those  mortgage-backed  securities—people  started looking at it and tried to find  out: Where did they get the mortgages?  I wanted to add to your scenario of  where all of these bad, what we might  call toxic assets, which are mortgage-  backed securities that are in default,  where did they come from and where  are they? And I wanted to make sure  that your wonderful talk about this  subject included the fact that for a period of time the U.S. Government was  pushing very hard on Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac to accept mortgages on  homes  that  any  reasonable  person  knew could not be afforded, could not  be paid  for, and they were pushing  thousands of them to get people  in  homes even if they could not pay for  them. And that is thousands of those—  hundreds  of  thousands  are  coming  home to roost now, as I understand it,  and we do not even know where we are,  but we find out when a bank starts failing because they are using this as their  equity—they  bought  them—and  it  turns out to be sour because they are  not paying on the mortgage. You go  look, and there is a house there backing up that mortgage, and maybe a  family was in it, but they are already  6 months in default and they have left  the place and it is falling down, and  you have a mortgage here that you are  holding.  I do not think we ever painted properly for the American people that this  was not a bailout of Wall Street; it was  an effort to buy up those assets, these  mortgages that were out there that  were not going to be paid, that could  not be paid, and they had gone sour.  We are trying to buy them and let the  system work while we try to repackage  them and sell them. It could very well  be, Senator—I think you would agree—  that when this $700 billion, or whatever  number it is, is used, it will come back  to the Federal Government as they sell  the toxic assets they buy. They will be  buying them and bundling them and  selling them again, and they may bring  more money 3 or 4 years from now than  you paid for them.  So in no way is it a bailout. It is a  buyout, if anything. I wondered if you  had thought of it that way. Is that a  fair reading, as you understand things?  ",2008
1504,30,2008-09-30,Mr. DORGAN.," Well,  let me  talk  about the banker’s role for a minute,  because the way the Senator describes  it is part of my concern. It used to be  that when you bought a home, you  would go down to the local savings and  loan or the local bank and try to negotiate a home loan. Then sitting across  the desk, they would evaluate what  kind of job do you have, how much  family income do you have, how secure  is your job, is this a loan we want to  provide to you because of the risk, and  so on. They would make a judgment  about you. They would check your  credit rating. That is the way it would  work. It doesn’t work that way in most  cases now. It does in some cases, in  most cases not. This has become a big  go-go effort to get home  loans out  there,  securitize  them, and  sell  the  mortgage-backed securities.  So when we are talking about banks  buying mortgage-backed securities, I  asked the question: Why should they be  buying mortgage-backed  securities?  They shouldn’t even have the right to  buy mortgage-backed  securities  that  are cut into these little pieces of sausage and sent upstream when they do  not even know what is in them. How  many of  them are  subprime? They  don’t have any idea. All they see is an  advertised yield that says: Well, if I  buy this security, I am going to get a  big, fat income from it.  Going back, I would like to see us get  back to the day when a mortgage is  something negotiated across the desk  from the local banker. I would like to  see the day when you can take a look  at the balance sheet of a bank—and I  would say in my home State most of  our bankers have not been engaged in  this at all. They do not have toxic  mortgages, by and large. They have not  invested in these things. But this became  a  go-go  industry—I  described  some of them, and I will do it again in  a minute—with massive amounts of  money being made, on Wall Street, I  might say. So Wall Street was wallowing in cash. You know it and I know  it—I mean, the highest income earner  last year, $3.7 billion; that is $300 million a month, $10 million a day.  So I understand why the American  people are angry. They are saying, you  know: If you have to do something to  rescue the financial system, for gosh  sakes, don’t let the system collapse,  but they also say: Let’s clean up this  carnival of greed that existed around  here that caused this to happen.  So that is why I think the American  people—I do not know who uses the  term ‘‘bailout’’ or ‘‘rescue,’’ but that is  why the American people  looked at  this and said: Wait a second, I want  you to do the whole job, not half a job.  In my judgment, half a job is putting  up whatever money you need at this  point. Perhaps there is a better way to  do it. Perhaps we ought to invest in the  capital structure of some of the failing  institutions and get a return from that.  The other side of it is to decide that, in  addition to whatever we decide on the  money, we are going to re-regulate and  reform. If those two things are not in  the bill, I hope those who are now negotiating will put that in the bill because  I  think  the American people  might better understand what is going  to be done.  ",2008
1505,30,2008-09-30,Mr. DOMENICI.," Let me say in closing that I am not sure that a recovery  bill—that we have time to do the kind  of reshaping of the regulatory system  that the Senator so aptly describes. I  don’t know that it can be done. That  requires an awful lot of hearings and  thinking.  I would hope this bill doesn’t  fail  when they have it ready because, as  somebody as knowledgeable as you—  and you know the problem and you  know we are going to have a big failure  in our system that is going to affect far  more people than the culprits who got  us into it. I would hope that ultimately  you would help to pass the bill. But I  understand you would like other things  that are going to be needed. We are  going to have to do them. I will not be  here. I wish you luck. It has been hard  to  revamp Freddie Mac and Fannie  Mae, but it has been done. I am just  not expert enough today to tell you  that all of the problems with Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac have been solved  because we changed their rules when  we helped and tried to stabilize them  within the last month. And they are  the biggest purveyors of these mortgage-backed securities.  A mortgage-backed security is just a  mortgage and a loan put into a package, and it becomes a security so that  it can be traded as a security instrument  instead  of  a mortgage  being  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:07 Oct 01, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G30SE6.057 S30SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2008

1511,44,2008-09-30,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, it is very  standard in the Senate, we say  ‘‘the  distinguished gentleman,’’ and we say  that a lot, and we mean it. But it is  never more meaningful than when you  refer  as a distinguished gentleman because that says it  all. If there were ever a distinguished  gentleman, JOHNWARNER is that person.  I can remember when I first came to  the Senate 22 years ago, I was so fortunate. I was placed on the Environment  and Public Works Committee. JOHN  WARNER, even though he had been here  a while, was one of the relatively new  members of that committee. Some people had been there for so long. John  Chafee was the ranking Republican on  that committee. What a wonderful man  he was. But anyway, JOHNWARNER, he  took such good care of me. He looked  out for me. I sat on the other side of  the dais, but he took good care of me.  We were able to do some good things.  I was fortunate, I was subcommittee  chairman my freshman year. Senator  WARNERwill probably remember this.  We worked on a number of things. One  of the things we worked on was Alar. It  was a product that people sprayed on  cherries, apples, grapes to keep them  from  falling off the trees and vines  more quickly. We legislated and legislated, and we were never able to get  anything passed, but we accomplished  what we set out to do because through  the hearing process we focused so much  attention on this that people stopped  using it.  JOHNWARNER is a distinguished gentleman. There is no more distinguished  gentleman than the man we refer to as  JOHNWARNER—JOHNWILLIAMWARNER.  I love his stories. He talks about his  dad who was a physician.  When JOHNwas 17, he had  in his  heart that it was important to wear  the uniform of the American serviceman. He volunteered for the Navy so he  could fight in World War II. He says he  did not do any fighting, but he would  have if he had been called upon to do  so.  After his first tour of duty, he returned home to his native Virginia,  where he attended Washington and Lee  University on the GI bill, and then the  University  of Virginia Law School,  which, by the way, then and is now a  very difficult school to get in. It is always rated as one of the top 10 law  schools in America. It is a great school.  His  legal  studies were  interrupted  again to be in the U.S. military, this  time as an officer in the Marine Corps  during the Korean war. His 10 years in  the Marine Corps earned him the rank  of captain, CAPT JOHNWARNER.  When he completed  law school, he  was selected as a law clerk by one of  the outstanding and historic circuit  court  judges: E. Barrett Prettyman.  What a name: E. Barrett Prettyman.  But those of us who have been in the  practice of law have always recognized  that Prettyman wrote  some  pretty  opinions. He was a renowned lawyer  and, of course, now we have a Federal  courthouse  named  after  Judge  Prettyman as a result of his being such  an outstanding  judge. JOHNWARNER  worked for him.  After 4 years as an assistant U.S. attorney, JOHNWARNERwas appointed  and confirmed as Under Secretary of  the Navy, then as Secretary of the  Navy.  Then, one of my fond memories of  JOHNWARNER is his telling a story. He  was Under Secretary; John Chafee,  whom I had the good fortune to serve  with in the Senate, was the Secretary  of the Navy. The Vietnam war was ongoing. They were asked by the Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird,  to  come down and see what was going on  at the Capitol Mall. So, as Senator  WARNER said, they left their Cadillacs  someplace else that was supplied to the  Secretary and  the Under Secretary,  and they took off their fancy clothes  and came down to the Capitol Mall.  And look around they did. There were  tens of thousands of people here, tens  of thousands—hundreds of thousands of  people at the Mall. They were demonstrating against the war. Frankly,  after  listening  to  the  speeches and  watching the crowd and seeing the fervor  of  the  crowd,  both  Secretary  Chafee and Under Secretary WARNER  returned  to  the Pentagon and  recommended to Melvin Laird that he better take a close look at this war, that  things would have to change, based on  their observation of what was happening on the Capitol Mall that day.  That is JOHNWARNER perfectly described:  Someone who  gathers  the  facts,  and  after  having  an  understanding of the facts, issues his honest  opinion as to what is going on. He and  John Chafee,  two wonderful human  beings, two dedicated servants of the  U.S. military returned back to the Secretary of Defense and said: Things have  to change.  After serving in the Department of  the Navy, he did a number of other  things. But the story I try to tell is, I  repeat, a real JOHNWARNERportrayal  because he is always eager to listen to  all sides of an issue. He is always willing to part from conventional wisdom  in order to do the right thing, and then  once he says he is going to do something, that is it. So after serving in the  Department of the Navy, he decided he  would accept the challenge of being the  national coordinator for America’s bicentennial celebration in 1976. As my  colleagues know, there are a  lot of  things that happened during that period of time under his leadership. But  as a little side story, there is a story  about Virginia City, NV. Virginia City,  NV, at one time was a thriving place of  some 30,000 or 40,000. It was the reason  Nevada became a State so far ahead of  most Western territories. In 1864, we  became a State. But as part of his  going around the country, as you do  when you have a job such as his, raising money and giving speeches, he was  asked to go to Virginia City, this historic place in Nevada. He had never  been there. It is a very winding road to  get up there, and  it  is a dangerous  road. But he was looking forward to  being there because one of the patrons  in the area—there are some people who  are wealthy in Virginia City—decided  to have dinner in honor of the bicentennial celebration. So JOHNWARNER  and his entourage arrive in little Virginia City, which now, by the way, is  not 30,000 or 40,000, it is a very small  community of maybe, if we are lucky,  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:37 Oct 01, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G30SE6.081 S30SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2008

1514,51,2008-09-30,Mr.  REID.," Mr.  President,  today  President Bush took time away from  dealing with the Nation’s economic crisis to direct his Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to release a new  standard for  ‘acceptable’ public radiation exposure from the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump.  In other  words, the agency decided  just how  much radiation you and I can live with.  Let me be clear, there is no way this  weak standard will breathe  life  into  the Bush-McCain plan to dump nuclear  waste in Nevada. Instead, it will breath  life into more litigation against this  terrible project.  The EPA has collaborated with the  Department of Energy, DOE, to tweak  a standard that a Federal court of appeals threw out in 2001 because it failed  to comply with the Energy Policy Act  of 1992 and would have left Nevadans  dangerously unprotected against radioactive contamination. If the repository  at Yucca Mountain was ever actually  built,  the DOE does not deny  that  water  infiltration would  eventually  corrode nuclear waste packages and radioactivity will  inevitably  leak  into  Nevada’s  ground water.  Instead  of  working to protect Nevadans from a  public health catastrophe, this scandal-  ridden EPA has chosen to simply make  the rules more lenient so DOE can legally dump waste less than 100 miles  outside of Las Vegas. This is unacceptable.  Instead of working to protect the  health and safety of Nevadans, EPA  and DOE are casting science aside in an  attempt to get the nuclear waste dump  approved. Instead of warring against  science, I side with Nevadans and experts who support safe and attainable  solutions  to  our  Nation’s  nuclear  waste. That is why I am working with  Senator ENSIGN to keep nuclear waste  on-site at the powerplants where it is  produced  in secure dry cask storage  containers that are approved by the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This  plan is safer, more cost effective, and  will give us at least a century to find a  more permanent solution to nuclear  waste.  f  RULE XLIV COMPLIANCE  ",2008
1515,51,2008-09-30,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, there  are over 150 public land bills on the  Senate calendar  that have been  reported from the Committee on Energy  and Natural Resources during the 110th  Congress, for which we have not been  able to get unanimous consent to take  up and pass. In an effort to try to facilitate their consideration by the Senate in the limited time remaining in  this session, I have assembled them  into a single amendment, SA 5662, to  the Monongahela National Forest Wilderness Bill, H.R.  5151.  I  filed  the  amendment last Friday, September 26,  and it has been printed in the RECORD  at S9731–S9840.  Paragraph  4 of  rule XLIV of  the  Standing Rules of the Senate provides  that  If during consideration of a bill, . . . a Senator proposes an amendment containing a  congressionally directed spending item . . . ,  which was not included in the bill . . . as  placed on the calendar or as reported by any  committee . . . , then as soon as practicable,  the Senator shall ensure that a list of such  items . . . is printed in the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD.  The term  ‘‘congressionally directed  spending item’’ is broadly defined to  include  a provision . . . included primarily at the  request of a Senator . . . authorizing . . . a  specific amount of discretionary budget authority . . . for . . . expenditure with or to  an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional district, other than  through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process.  Although no Senator has specifically  requested me to include a congressionally directed spending item in SA 5662,  in the interest of furthering the transparency and accountability of the legislative process, I have posted a list of  the specific authorizations in SA 5662  on the Web site of the Committee on  Energy and Natural Resources. The list  includes  the name of  the principal  sponsors of the Senate bills that have  been incorporated in the amendment.  In the hope that the Senate might  yet be able to consider this important  amendment before we adjourn, I ask  unanimous consent that the  list be  printed in the RECORD in accordance  with rule XVIV.

1516,58,2008-09-30,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, in Iowa  and across the United States, a new  school year has begun. As you know,  Iowa public schools have an excellent  reputation nationwide, and Iowa students’ test scores are among the highest in the Nation.  I would like to take just a few minutes  today  to  salute  the dedicated  teachers, administrators, and  school  board members in the Mediapolis Community School District, and to report  on their participation in a unique Federal partnership to repair and modernize school facilities.

Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 million  for the  State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school districts to receive  these grants for a range of renovation  and repair efforts everything from updating fire safety systems to building  new schools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal  funding is used to leverage public and/  or private local funding, so it often has  a tremendous multiplier effect  in a  local school district.  The Mediapolis Community School  District received several Harkin  fire  safety grants totaling $150,000 which it  used for improvements to the fire safety system including fire exits, smoke  and heat  detectors,  and  emergency  lighting at several district buildings  and to replace a section of the roof at  the high school and to repair and replace deteriorating plaster in the middle  school gymnasium. The Federal  grants have made it possible for the  district  to provide quality and  safe  schools for their students.  Excellent schools do not just pop up  like mushrooms after a rain. They are  the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a tremendous amount of  collaboration among local officials and  concerned  citizens.  I  salute  superintendent Frederick Whipple,  former  superintendent Bill Newman, the entire staff, administration, and governance  in  the Mediapolis Community  School District. In particular, I would  like to recognize the leadership of the  board of education—president Sandy  Hedges, vice president Kenton Klenk,  Michael Brown, Ralph Kaufman, Toby  Gordon, Dawn Dunnegan and David  Baker and former members Kim Hull,  Jack Bell, Sherry Spence, Kathryn  Whisler, Richard Pfeiff, Melodee Kennedy, Julie Edwards and the late Terry  Miller.  As we mark the 10th anniversary of  the Harkin school grant program  in  Iowa, I am obliged to point out that  many  thousands of  school buildings  and facilities across the United States  are in dire need of renovation or replacement. In my State of Iowa alone,  according to a recent study, some 79  percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The harsh reality is  that the average age of school buildings in the United States is nearly 50  years.  Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming  sports arenas on weekends, but during  the week go to school in rundown or  antiquated  facilities. This  sends exactly the wrong message to our young  people about our priorities. We have to  do better.  That is why I am deeply grateful to  the professionals and parents  in the  Mediapolis  Community  School District. There is no question that a quality public education for every child is a  top priority in that community. I salute them, and wish them a very successful new school year.∑  f  SOUTHEAST POLK COMMUNITY  EDUCATION  ∑",2008
1517,58,2008-09-30,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, in Iowa  and across the United States, a new  school year has begun. As you know,  Iowa public schools have an excellent  reputation nationwide, and Iowa students’ test scores are among the highest in the Nation.  I would like to take just a few minutes  today  to  salute  the dedicated  teachers, administrators, and  school  board members in the Southeast Polk  Community School District, and to report on their participation in a unique  Federal partnership to repair and modernize school facilities.  This fall marks the 10th year of the  Iowa  Demonstration  Construction  Grant Program. That  is  its  formal  name, but it is better known among  educators in Iowa as the program of  Harkin grants for Iowa public schools.

In many cases, this Federal  funding is used to leverage public and/  or private local funding, so it often has  a tremendous multiplier effect  in a  local school district.  The  Southeast  Polk  Community  School District received several Harkin  grants totaling $2,486,943 which it used  to help modernize and make safety improvements  throughout  the district.  The district received four construction  grants totaling $2,108,922 to help build a  new school in Runnells, to help provide  additional classrooms at Mitchellville,  Delaware, and Centennial schools and  to help build Clay Elementary in Altoona. The additional classrooms and  new schools are needed to address rapid  growth of students in the district. This  school is a modern, state-of-the-art facility that befits the educational ambitions and excellence of this school district. Indeed, it is the kind of school facility that every child in America deserves. The district also received four  fire safety grants totaling $377,951 to  make safety improvements throughout  the district.  Excellent schools do not just pop up  like mushrooms after a rain. They are  the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a tremendous amount of  collaboration among local officials and  concerned citizens. I salute the entire  staff, administration, and governance  in  the Southeast Polk Community  School District. In particular, I would  like to recognize the leadership of the  board  of  education  president Brad  Skinner, vice president Steve Hanson,  Katie Temple, Andrew McGrean, Tom  Hadden,  Joanne Moeller,  and Lori  Slings, and former board members Pat  Staggs VanderWert, Doug Workman,  Gwen Seward Lewis, Jack Scrignoli,  Richard  Owens,  Valarie  Campbell,  Doug Keast, and Marion Vande Wall. I  would also  like  to  recognize  superintendent Thomas Downs, former superintendent Dr. Joseph Drips, associate superintendent Dr. Stephen Miller, business manager Mike Hamilton,  director  of  support  services  Dan  Janssen and the cochairpersons Tom  Hadden and Melissa Horton and volunteers for the ‘‘It’s For the Kids’’ campaign which worked to pass the bond  referendum.

1518,65,2008-09-30,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  today I am pleased to submit, along  with Senator BENNETT, a  resolution  supporting National Cyber Security  Awareness Month.  The  connectivity provided by  the  Internet has profoundly changed almost every aspect of our lives, but it  has also given rise to what I view as  the next great threat to our national  security and our economic security,  the danger of cyber attack, cyber espionage, and cyber crime.  At the policy  level, responding to  this threat requires the development of  advanced technologies combined with  creative  new  Government  policies.  Above all, we need to focus on improving the cyber security of the Federal  Government  and  the  critical  infrastructure, including our electric power  grid,  communications,  banking,  and  transportation systems. These are all  critical to our way of life and we must  work together to ensure they are secure.  Of course, whatever we do to monitor  and thwart bad actors on the Internet,  we must be careful to preserve the privacy and civil liberties of U.S. persons,  especially during the transition from a  legal structure based on older technologies to a legal structure designed  for the Internet age.  We must also think about the best  way  to  communicate  our  national  cyber security policy to the public.  Though some elements of the threat  and our response must be kept classified, the public needs to understand the  general nature of the threat we face,  the Government’s responsibility to secure the internet, and how Government  involvement will affect U.S. persons  and privacy.  Fortunately, I am happy to report an  increasing level of interest and debate  on Capitol Hill and around the country.  Here in Washington, in the past year,  the Senate Intelligence Committee has  held two hearings and many Member  briefings, setup a working group with  seven staff, sponsored two Technical  Advisory Group studies, and worked  with other congressional committees  in a bipartisan manner on cyber issues.  Back home in West Virginia, at our  State Homeland Security Summit, we  held a productive session focused on  cyber security for State and local leaders. I have taken on this issue as a priority of  increasing  importance, but  much work remains to be done. I encourage  everyone  to help me  raise  awareness and develop effective channels of communication on this issue.  One of the ways we can raise awareness is by supporting National Cyber  Security Awareness Month, coming up  in October. Each year, the National  Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security joins with  the National Cyber Security Alliance,  the Multi-State  Information Sharing  and Analysis Center, and other organizations working to improve cyber security in the U.S. to support National  Cyber Security Awareness Month.  The goal is to educate and empower  Internet users to take simple steps to  safeguard themselves from the latest  online threats and respond to cyber  crime; and to bring Federal agencies,  national organizations, businesses, and  educational  institutions  together  to  encourage development and implementation of cyber security best practices.  I thank my distinguished colleague,  Senator BENNETT, for cosponsoring this  resolution and  for his  leadership on  this issue. I look forward to working  with Senator BENNETTand other members of Congress to improve our cyber  security in the future.  f  SENATE RESOLUTION  698—DESIGNATING  OCTOBER  17,  2008,  AS  ‘‘NATIONAL  MAMMOGRAPHY  DAY’’  Mr. REID (for Mr. BIDEN(for himself,  Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. CASEY, Mrs. DOLE,  Mr. LEAHY, Mrs. BOXER, Mr. INHOFE,  Mr. WHITEHOUSE, Mr. JOHNSON, Mr.  WYDEN, and Mr. BAYH)) submitted the  following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:  S. RES. 698  Whereas, according to the American Cancer Society, in 2008, 182,460 women will be diagnosed with  invasive breast cancer and  40,480 women will die from that disease;  Whereas it is estimated that about 2,000,000  women were diagnosed with breast cancer in  the 1990s, and that in nearly 500,000 of those  cases the cancer resulted in death;  Whereas approximately 3,000,000 women in  the United States are living with breast cancer, about 2,300,000 have been diagnosed with  the disease, and an estimated 1,000,000 do not  yet know they have the disease;  Whereas African-American women suffer a  36 percent greater mortality rate from breast  cancer than White women and more than a  100  percent  greater mortality  rate  from  breast cancer than women  from Hispanic,  Asian, and American Indian populations;  Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases  with age, with a woman at age 70 having  twice as much of a chance of developing the  disease as a woman at age 50;  Whereas at least 90 percent of the women  who get breast cancer have no family history  of the disease;  Whereas mammograms, when  operated  professionally at a certified facility, can provide safe screening and early detection of  breast cancer in many women;  Whereas mammography  is an  excellent  method  for  early  detection  of  localized  breast cancer, which has a 5-year survival  rate of 98 percent;  Whereas the National Cancer Institute and  the American Cancer Society continue to  recommend periodic mammograms; and  Whereas the National Breast Cancer Coalition recommends that each woman and her  health care provider make an individual decision about mammography: Now, therefore,  be it  Resolved, That the Senate—  (1) designates October 17, 2008, as  tional Mammography Day’’; and  (2) encourages the people of the United  States to observe the day with appropriate  programs and activities.  ‘‘Na",2008
1519,65,2008-09-30,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, today I  am submitting a resolution designating  October 17, 2008, as  ‘‘National Mammography Day.’’ This  is  the  16th  straight year I have introduced such  legislation, and I am proud to say that  on each occasion the Senate has shown  its support for the fight against breast  cancer by approving the resolution.  Each year, as I prepare to introduce  this resolution, I review the latest information from the American Cancer  Society about breast cancer. For 2008,  it  is  estimated  that nearly  182,460  women will be diagnosed with invasive  breast cancer and 40,480 women will die  of this disease.  The first several times I introduced  this resolution, I commented on how  gloomy  the  statistics  surrounding  breast cancer were. While we still must  address  the unfortunate  trend of a  higher mortality rate in African American women when compared to that of  White women and women from other  minority groups, there are some numbers that give us hope in our struggle  to defeat this disease. As I mentioned  last year, the trend over time is that  the number of deaths from breast cancer  is  fairly stable and  falling  from  year to year. According to the American Cancer Society, the death rate  from breast cancer in women has decreased since 1990: between 1975–1990,  the death rate increased by 0.4 percent;  between 1990–2004, the death rate decreased by 2.2 percent annually.  This decline  in  the breast cancer  mortality rate has been attributed to  improvements in breast cancer treatment, as well as early detection from  mammograms  and  other  screening  methods. New digital techniques make  the process of mammography more  rapid and precise than before. In addition, early detection of breast cancer  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:58 Oct 01, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A30SE6.053 S30SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2008

1523,72,2008-09-30,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. Presdient,  I am  pleased that the Senate today will pass  the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act  Amendments of 2008. The Senate unanimously passed a similar bill last year.  This is a small, but important, piece of  legislation and has bipartisan support.  This updated version was introduced to  address concerns of the Navy, and gives  the Department of Defense full assurance that Government and defense designs will not be subject to unwarranted restrictions. I thank the cosponsors  of  the  Senate’s  bill—Senator  CORNYN, Senator KOHL, and Senator  WHITEHOUSE—for all their hard work  and contributions.  In 1998, Congress passed the Vessel  Hull Design Protection Act to recognize the significant time, effort, and innovation that figure into ship design.  Recent action in the courts has made it  clear that in order to be effective, this  law needs to be clarified and refined.  This bill does exactly that, and no  more, by clarifying the definition of  ‘‘hull’’ and ‘‘deck.’’ This ensures that  the intellectual property rights of vessel hull designers will be protected.  I am pleased the Senate will adopt  this measure today, and I look forward  to the President signing it into law.  ",2008

1527,72,2008-09-30,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. Presdient,  I am  pleased that the Senate has passed the  Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008, a  short but important bill for all of us  who love to listen to music online. I  have long championed the development  of new business models for transmitting music to the public, and I have  been delighted to see the webcasting  community grow and prosper. From  tiny operations serving the smallest of  musical niches, to collegiate stations  playing cutting edge performers,  to  large established webcasters providing  a whole new array of services to listeners,  the online music world has  truly blossomed in the last 10 years.  But with all new growth comes growing pains, and we also must be constantly vigilant to ensure that the development of new business  interests  does not come at the expense of settled  property rights.  When webcasting was even younger, I  sponsored the Small Webcasters Settlement Act of 2004, which established a  Copyright Royalty Tribunal to replace  the old Copyright Arbitration Royalty  Panel as the administrative body for  determining—in  the absence of privately negotiated contracts—the royalty rates to be paid by online music  providers to the performers who hold  the copyrights in that music. The new  system has seen its first adjudications,  and this legislation reflects the need  for a slight readjustment in that system. The bill simply extends the time  to next February during which the parties can negotiate their own rates, even  after the CRB proceeding, and will permit any deal that is negotiated by that  time to bind the interested parties.  I am not, in the normal course, a proponent  of  legislative  readjustments  like this one, but I understand the advisability of this particular extension.  I will not, however, sanction repeated  returns to Congress if webcasters are  again dissatisfied with the results of a  system that they urged upon us in 2004,  and which they applauded when it was  created. The parties on both sides of  these agreements—the webcasters and  the copyright owners—would be well  advised to consider these negotiations  seriously, and to behave appropriately.  The rights of our creative artists are  the life blood of the entire music industry, including that of the online music  providers, and we all owe them respect.  I trust the parties when they tell us  that  the  time  extension will allow  them to come to terms that will ensure  mutual benefit to them, and ultimate  benefit to all the listeners, like myself,  who enjoy music transmitted over the  Internet. I am pleased the Congress has  passed this measure before recessing.  ",2008

1539,93,2008-09-30,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Madam Speaker, the Trinity College class of 1958 celebrated its 50th  anniversary of graduation this past May, in a  festive  gathering  of  classmates  renewing  friendships, reliving prized memories of  their  campus years, and sharing experiences of career paths followed since Trinity days.  With my late wife, Jo, I met and came to respect and love the extraordinary women of the  class of 1958: Bobbi Marhofer, Fran Collins,  Judy Pauley, Carolyn Moynihan, among others, and those, like Jo, who are no longer with  us—especially Jo’s dearest friend in the class,  Sara Lucas.  The 1958 commencement address delivered  by Senator John F. Kennedy could not have  been more compelling or memorable than the  reflective, thoughtful retrospective reunion address offered by Class of 1958 alumna Colette  Hoppmann Dowling, a gifted,  talented,  internationally renowned writer. Ms. Dowling invites  not only her classmates, but all of us to consider soberly, profoundly,  the risky status of  older women who live alone—a condition none  of the exuberant graduates in 1958 could ever  have anticipated.  I invite my colleagues to read and reflect seriously on this message and its public policy  implications.  Colette Dowling  is an  internationally  renowned writer of eight books whose ‘‘The Cinderella Complex’’ was translated into 23 languages. She is currently completing training in  psychoanalysis and has a private  therapy  practice in Manhattan. Ms. Dowling gave the  following talk to her classmates at the Trinity  University Class of 1958’s fiftieth reunion, on  May 31, 2008, in Washington, DC.  FACINGDOWNTHEBAGLADY: OLDERWOMEN  INAMERICA  (By Colette Dowling, LMSW)  Six years ago, in the spring of 2002, I was  barreling down the Mass Pike towards Woodstock, my ten-year-old Saab stuffed to the  tops of its windows with computer and printer, fax and stereo, with towels and sheets and  comforter, with  jeans and shirts and one  good outfit in case I needed it. Last but not  least, my writing desk, which fortunately  can be dismantled for transport. Some surgeries that fall had slowed me down and I’d  had to give up my house in Woodstock and  spend the winter at my son’s, in Massachusetts. Now I was returning to the town I’d  called home for 20 years. I rather liked that  I’d reached the point where I could travel  light, but I had to ask myself: How light is  light? I was down to my last sixty dollars  and waiting  for my next  social  security  check to arrive. The market value of my JP  Morgan portfolio? One-tenth of a cent, according to the statement I’d just received.  Although my account had long been worthless they were still sending me the things. I  guess they were hanging in for the long haul,  as I was.  Basically, when I wasn’t imagining what  my parents would think if they could see me  now, I was telling myself, ‘‘I’ll handle this.’’  I  was  reminding myself  that  I  was  unencumbered and had an able mind. But I’d  sold almost everything I owned, not in order  to enter a convent (although the thought had  crossed my mind) but because royalties from  my books had seriously dwindled. In recent  months  I’d  found myself  thinking,  ‘‘I’ve  worked hard all my life, sent my children to  college and graduate school. How could this  have happened?’’  Earlier that year I’d written a proposal for  a book on discrimination against women in  the workplace. Fifteen publishers read  it,  and fifteen gracefully declined.  ‘‘We agree  with her thesis,’’ one editor told my agent,  ‘‘but the subject is too down.’’  Too down, indeed. In my 35 years as a writer, this was my first rejection of a book proposal and it fueled my apprehension that the  winds of change were upon me. To stabilize  my later-life income I’d begun living in a  rented cottage and substantially cut my expenses. But then came two shockers, first, a  mastectomy for an early stage cancer. Then,  three weeks later, on the afternoon of September 11, I entered the emergency room  needing  surgery  for an obstructed bowel  caused by adhesions from a prior appendectomy. That winter, after recuperating at my  son’s, in Massachusetts, I forged ahead with  research for another book proposal. That,  too, came to naught. Suddenly it seemed as  if everything in publishing had just dried up.  For a while, an interest-free loan from the  Authors League Fund was what got me by.  Two  surgeries,  two  rejected book proposals, three strikes and you’re out. I had to  come up with something radical and decided  to pursue an old dream. I’d long had fantasies of becoming a psychoanalyst. I would  need a masters in social work before I could  be accepted into an analytic training institute. With two weeks to meet the deadline I  applied to Smith College and that summer—  the summer of 2002—I began classes. It was  going to be a long haul. Smith would take  two years and the analytic training another  four. I knew that by the time I finished I’d  be over 70.  Once I entered school things were a little  less  rocky,  financially,  thanks  to  school  loans from the government. But of course,  once Smith ended so did the loans. I needed  a job, at least for the first couple of years of  analytic training, while I was getting my  practice up and running. I became a counselor for homeless children in the Brooklyn  public schools. The kids were great but the  commute was hellish. Each day after working with the kids I traveled an hour by subway to the Upper West Side of Manhattan to  see patients in the clinic of my analytic institute. For over a year I was clocking fifteen hours a week on the subways, with  house music and hip hop leaking from people’s headphones. I grew up on Junior Walker  and Elvis Presley and yearned for the day  when I could buy an Ipod in self defense.  After a while, catching a little breathing  space, I began to do some research on how  my  finances stacked up against those of  other older women. What  I  learned was  shocking. The economic constraints I was  experiencing were not only far from unique,  the odds had actually been in favor of my becoming an older woman who had found herself, at sixty-five, facing down the bag lady.  Particularly at risk are older women who  live alone. Over a decade ago a U.S. Committee on Aging found that half of older  women living alone had incomes below $9,500  a year.  But whether or not they live alone, the  picture for older women is pretty dim. According to the AARP Public Policy Institute,  the median income for women over 65 is just  about $3,000 above the Census definition of  poverty. Older women have slightly over half  the money older men have.  A third of us are getting by on $12,000 annually, often on much less. Poverty by any  other  name,  although  the  government  doesn’t consider an individual officially poor  if she’s got more than $8,000 coming in. The  women who live on nothing but Social Security—and that’s almost a quarter of us—certainly fit in the officially poor category.  The only person in this country with less  economic protection than the older white  woman is the older woman of color. Of those  over 65 and living alone, seventy-seven percent of blacks and seventy-nine percent of  Hispanics are poor, once they’ve paid their  social security taxes, according to the Census Bureau. Forget that they don’t have pensions, many women of color don’t even get  Social Security—those,  for  example, who  work in domestic labor or agriculture, fields  of endeavor in which the pay is so low it’s  often impossible to meet the minimum for a  so-called  ‘‘working  quarter’’.  Without  enough  of  these  quarters,  these women  who’ve worked all their lives picking peas  and scrubbing floors in order to support their  children, end up with nothing.  The truth is, women travel the borders of  poverty at many points  in their—as students, or young single mothers, or as older  women living alone. The National Women’s  Law Center reports that 70% of women in  America earn less than $20,000 a year. Forty  percent earn less than $10,000. Women are  twice as likely as men to be poor, a disparity  that increases with age.  For some time I’d though there must be  something wrong with me for having arrived  at such a low down place, some elemental  bad thing. It’s because I never fully understood that the financial pressures I endured  at different times of my life were standard  for a women—first, as a woman entering the  job market, in 1958, later as a widow and a  single mother. I’d always held the conviction  that the economic price women pay for bearing children was temporary; sooner or later  they catch up. Now that I’m seeing things  from the other end of the age telescope, I’m  beginning to get the picture. They never  catch up. According to the National Center  for Women and Retirement Research,  for  every year a woman stays home caring for a  child, she has to work an extra five years to  recover lost income. I needed only to apply  the five-year-per child formula to my own  situation to understand why I hadn’t retired  at 65. Three children equals  fifteen extra  years. Eighty, here I come!  The dire straits women face in old age have  little to do with age per se, Population Bulletin reports. It’s the economic disadvantages they face earlier in life that lead to the  insecurity  they  experience when  they’re  older. For example, two thirds of women who  work outside the home have no pensions.  When they do, their benefits are half of  men’s. A study from Brandeis that began in  1967 tracked 5,000 women over the course of  their lives and found that poverty in old age  was the direct result of  inequities they’d  faced when they were younger.  This certainly, is not the way the public  thinks about older women’s poverty, when it  thinks about it at all.  I’d always imagined that my work- and income-history would put me in a place far different than where my mother found herself  in her final years. A quarter of a century ago  I was fortunate to have a best seller, but fortune can be misleading. Royalties don’t last  forever. After The Cinderella Complex the  money I received on subsequent books was  only enough to get me through until the  next proposal. Like most writers I lived from  book proposal to book proposal. I’m proud of  the eight books I’ve written but the work  hasn’t provided me with long-term security.  So here I am now, in my seventies, with the  hounds of heaven at my heels.

1540,100,2008-09-30,Mr. STUPAK.," Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Larry Inman as he receives Northern  Michigan University’s Distinguished  Alumni  Award. Larry is a northern Michigan resident  who has been an exemplary leader in business,  in his community and  in  the State of  Michigan. I ask that you, Madam Speaker, and  the entire U.S. House of Representatives, join  me  in honoring Larry as he  receives  this  award for his service to NMU and his community.  Larry earned an associate’s degree  from  Northwestern Michigan College  in Traverse  City before graduating from Northern Michigan  University in Marquette in 1976. He is a retired  vice president of Huntington National Bank.  Since he was first elected in 1993, Larry has  served as a Grand Traverse County Commissioner, where he has been instrumental in assisting with economic development  for  the  county.  Beyond his career in banking and service to  the Grand Traverse  region, Larry has also  served the State of Michigan in a number of  capacities. Since 1998, he has represented a  10–county region of  the Northwest Michigan  Council of Governments. He serves on  the  Michigan Community Corrections Board, which  he chaired from 1999 to 2006. Larry served 4  years on the NMU Board of Trustees and recently began a term with the NMU Foundation  Board of Trustees. He is also a lifetime member of the NMU Alumni Association.  Larry remains active in the Michigan Association of Counties  (MAC). He quickly  rose  through the ranks of MAC and served a term  as president of the organization. He travels to  Washington annually to represent the interests  of local governments across Michigan.  The Northern Michigan University Alumni  Association Awards are presented  to NMU  alumni who have been a positive influence on  their  professions  and  their  communities  through public service or distinguished themselves  through outstanding achievements.  I  can  think of no one more deserving of  this  honor than Larry Inman.  In addition to being a good friend of mine,  Larry Inman has distinguished himself through  his service to his community. His public service and continued commitment  to Northern  Michigan University are an example for us all  to follow.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and the entire U.S. House of Representatives join me in  congratulating Larry  Inman as  the Northern  Michigan University Alumni Association Board  of Directors honors him with the Distinguished  Alumni Award.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON.

1545,11,2008-12-09,Mr. MCCONNELL.," The auto industry  is vitally  important to our Nation’s  economy, and it is vitally important to  my home State. This is not in dispute.  The question before us is how to reverse the decline of some of those automobile manufacturers after decades of  complicity between management and  labor.  I  understand  congressional Democrats sent a revised proposal to which  the majority  leader referred, to the  White House late last night. We will reserve our judgment until we see the  latest text. But the proposal we saw  yesterday afternoon  fails to achieve  our goal of securing long-term viability of ailing auto companies.  I wish to support a bill that revives  this industry. But I will not support a  bill that revives the patient with taxpayer dollars, yet does not secure a  commitment  that  the  patient will  change its ways so future help is not  needed. To do so would be a betrayal of  the millions of hardworking taxpayers  who are not at fault for the troubles in  the auto industry. It would be unfair to  the millions of Americans who depend  on these companies.  On the management side, the draft  plan released yesterday fails to require  the kind of serious reform that will ensure long-term viability for struggling  automobile companies. By giving the  Government the option of cancelling  Government assistance  in  the event  that reforms are not achieved, rather  than requiring it, we open the door to  unlimited Federal subsidies in the future.  Instead, we should demand management make the tough choices that are  required for long-term viability. This  is  the only  fair approach  from  the  standpoint of the taxpayer who is footing the bill. On the labor side, this bill  proposal fails to require any serious reform of legacy costs. Indeed, it states  explicitly that one of its purposes is to  preserve  the  same  retirement  and  health care benefits that have made  these companies so uncompetitive.  It is delusional to expect a company  that spends $71 per labor hour to compete with a company in a neighboring  State that spends $49 per labor hour. In  short, this proposal is deeply flawed because it fails to assure taxpayers, who  rightly expect us to be good stewards  of their hard-earned money, that they  will not be asked to shell out billions  few  more  in a  few years or even a  months from now.  Now, there are times when help is  needed. But one thing most people expect when they are asked for help is  that the one asking makes a commitment to change. This proposal does not  go nearly far enough. It holds neither  management nor labor truly accountable.  In areas where one side is held accountable, the other side is not. One  example is a provision that requires  automakers to drop all legal challenges  to State fuel economy standards that  are  inconsistent with  the  Federal  standard. Where is the offer from our  friends on the other side to call on environmental groups to drop their lawsuits?  Democrats say they want to solve  this problem as much as we do. Yet  they seem all too eager to tip the  scales to the detriment of the manufacturers. Look, there is plenty of blame  to go around for the problems that ail  the auto industry, but fixing half of a  problem is not a real solution.  Any successful proposal would force  companies to reform, either inside of  bankruptcy or outside of bankruptcy.  Without that mandate, there can be no  real expectation of reform. A good proposal would force automakers to get  control of their benefit costs. A good  proposal would make wages of struggling  companies  competitive  with  other automakers, not tomorrow but  today. A good proposal would end the  practice of paying workers who do not  work. A good proposal would rationalize dealer networks.  Just as  struggling airlines adjust  their capacity to respond to market  conditions, automakers must respond  to market demands as well. I regret  that the proposal Republicans saw yesterday afternoon does not do enough to  fix the whole problem. It subsidizes it.  A real solution must protect the taxpayers by forcing the changes needed  to put these companies on the path to  long-term success.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.  ",2008
1546,11,2008-12-09,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, the lifeline  we throw to Detroit has to be one that  gets them to shore, not part way to  shore. That is why I indicated in my  opening  statement  that  during  the  night there has been a lot of give-and-  take between the White House and the  two banking committees.  As I reported earlier, I think there  are only two major issues that are still  outstanding, and I am confident and  hopeful they can be resolved  in the  next few hours.  The issue before us is, what can we  do to stabilize an industry that has direct impact upon 2.5 million jobs in  this country. The mere fact that we  were trying to work something out  yesterday caused the stock market to  go up almost 300 points. The American  people want us to try to resolve this  issue.  But my friend is right. As strongly  connected as I am to organized labor, it  cannot be a one-sided proposal that is  brought before the Senate. I am confident it will not be. I have talked to  the Big Three operators. Some are held  in low repute. But that withstanding, I  think we are in a situation now where  we all have to kind of join hands, recognize that this is going to be a compromise, we are going to try to work  something out. That is what legislation is all about, the art of compromise  and consensus building. That is where  we are now. As I indicated, I think we  are very close to having something  that I think we can bring before the  body sometime today.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum.

1549,18,2008-12-09,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, today I  pay tribute to the parents of our good  friend and former colleague from Ohio,  Mike  DeWine.  Richard  and  Jean  DeWine died just a few weeks ago, 4  days apart from each other. Dick was  85, and Jean was 83. They were together  almost  their entire  lives,  sharing a  beautiful love story and 65 wonderful  years of marriage.  I had the honor of meeting Mike’s  parents in February when I was visiting Young’s Jersey Dairy  in their  hometown of Yellow Springs, OH. It  was a privilege to talk to them. They  were so gracious and kind. I could see  how proud they were of their son and  how proud they were of our Nation.  Mike spoke about his parents’ lives  and especially their love of family at  their joint funeral service held on November 5, 2008. In tribute to Dick and  Jean, I ask unanimous consent that  the entirety of his remarks be printed  in the RECORD at the conclusion of  mine.  There were no two finer Americans  than Dick and Jean DeWine. May God  bless them and their family.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  Thank you all so much for coming today  and for your friendship and love. Thank you  to JoFrannye, Patty, Jocelyn, and the choir  for the music, and to our grandson Albert for  playing the piano before Mass.  Thank you Father Geraci  and Father  Hagan for being the celebrants today, but I  have to say to Father Tom that right now,  Dad must be thinking: ‘‘This Mass is much,  much too long!’’  I once asked Dad why he kept going to  Fairborn to Mass. He told me he found a  great priest there, whose homilies were exactly 3 minutes long!  Fran and I thank all of you who helped  care for my parents, enabling them to stay  in their home the last few years, especially  Patrick, Jamie, Megan, and Barbara—thank  you. All of my parents’ care givers have been  just great.  And, thanks to all of you who stopped by  to visit my parents. Cousin Jerome, we  thank you for always being there to brighten  my parents’ day.  When I was growing up, I always thought  that I had the greatest parents in the world.  I never changed my mind.  My parents both grew up in Yellow Springs  and both lived on Xenia Avenue. Dad was  born at home in a house, which is the present  day Wind’s Cafe Wine Cellar. They lived next  door to the family feed store. Growing up  practically in the feed store, itself, and right  in the heart of Yellow Springs, Dad was surrounded by a colorful cast of characters who  would make a novelist proud! He could remember watching out his bedroom window  on Saturday nights, as fights would erupt between patrons of the local bars.  One time, when Dad was a young boy, my  grandfather asked him if he wanted to ride  with his employee, Jimmy, when he took a  feed delivery to Springfield. He told Dad he  could drag the bags from the back of the  truck up  to  the  front,  so  that Jimmy  wouldn’t have to get on and off the truck to  get them.  Before leaving town, Jimmy and Dad each  had a dime and bought a 5-cent Bluebird pie.  Since  they both had a nickel  left over,  Jimmy asked my young Dad if he wanted to  play the numbers. And, he did!  Later that day, when they got back to the  feed store, my grandfather, shouted, ‘‘Dick,  the Sheriff’s been looking for you! Were you  playing the numbers? Dad ran out of the  store, screaming,  ‘‘The Sheriff will never  find me!’’  He went out and hid among the stacks of  feed  sacks. When my grandfather  finally  found him, all he said was, ‘‘Here’s your $25—  you won!’’  At the same time, my mother was growing  up not far up the street. Mother’s father was  a professor of literature at Antioch College.  He was an expert in Shakespeare, Chaucer,  and Milton. He and my grandmother greatly  influenced my mother, particularly instilling in her a great love and appreciation for  words.  My grandfather had grown up on a farm in  upstate New York, and every summer, he  would take his family back there so he could  help with the farm work. Some of Mother’s  fondest memories were of those idyllic summers—playing with her sisters, Judy and  Dorothy, in the ice house on hot summer  days, riding hay wagons, walking to get groceries at the local general store, and watching her grandmother milk cows on a one-  legged stool!  As a young girl, Mother  loved to ride  horses. In fact, her parents kept a horse at  their house on Xenia Avenue! They called  the horse Cheyenne. Once when Mother was  about 11 years old, she rode Cheyenne all  alone from Yellow Springs to Wilberforce,  some 7 miles away, using only the directions  and map that my grandfather drew for her.  In the summer of 1940, one of my father’s  best friends was Herbert Berger. That year,  Herbert went away for the summer. He had  asked Dad to ‘‘look out for’’ his girlfriend,  who happened to be 15-year-old Jean Liddle.  Well, Dad did. And, my parents were inseparable from then on.  Dick DeWine and Jean Liddle married 3  years later on September 2, 1943. Dad was 20,  and Mother was 18.  World War II, of course, was raging at this  time. Dad went in as a replacement. He was  a Private with K Company and saw combat  in France, Germany, and Austria. Captain  Bell was their leader. About five years ago,  Dad sent an email about first seeing Captain  Bell when he and his buddy, Ernie Dessecker,  had arrived  in Europe and were awaiting  their company assignment. This is what my  dad wrote:  ‘‘We were told that the next morning, we  would be assigned to some  infantry company. That night, we went into a bar and  were bought some beer by some GI’s who  knew we were—for want of a better word—  very uptight. All they talked about was Captain Bell and his K Company. They told us  that if we wanted to do a lot of fighting that  would be the company to be assigned to.  That was not really what [Ernie] and I had in  mind!  The next day, we were loaded on a truck  and at each town, it would stop and some  names were called to get off. When Dess and  I were told to get off, the first thing we  asked was,  ‘What company is this?’ When  told it was Company K, we both wished we  could climb back on that truck and head for  the rear echelon! Of course, in a very short  time, we were so very proud to be part of  Captain Bell’s Company K. . . .’’  Dad never forgot the men with whom he  served, maintaining friendships for over six  decades. He also never forgot the horrific  things he saw when K Company was sent to  the Dachau concentration camp shortly after  it was liberated in April 1945. From the time  I was just a kid, Dad told me stories about  Dachau and how people in the nearby town  would tell the soldiers that they hadn’t really known what the Nazis were doing. Dad  could never quite comprehend that.  On the day before the German surrender in  Europe, Dad spent the night in a fox hole  near Innsbruck, Austria. He heard rumors  that the War was nearing an end. But still,  Dad stayed awake all night in that fox hole,  fearing that the enemy would attack. He remembered  thinking  that he  saw German  troops coming at him. When he compared  notes with all his buddies later, they, too,  had experienced the same thing.  When the War did end that next day, they  rode into Innsbruck, where people greeted  him and the other soldiers with a shower of  flowers. Meanwhile, Mother and Aunt Judy  celebrated the German surrender by riding  on a fire truck in an impromptu parade down  the streets of Yellow Springs. Dad’s two  younger siblings, my Aunt Mickey and Uncle  Jerry, watched the parade with pride.  Last week, I started reading my parents’  letters to each other when Dad was fighting  in Europe. They are letters of great passion  and love, written by two young kids, who  were only married a year when the War separated them. They write of their plans and  dreams and of the child they hoped to conceive as soon as Dad got home. Dad’s letter  refers to that child as ‘‘Mike,’’ while Mother’s letter references Michael—a distinction  they would each make throughout my life.  Dad came home in April, in time for Reds  Opening Day, and I was born on January 5th,  that year.  Dad taught me to fish, to hunt, and to love  OSU football and Dayton Flyer basketball.  But, his real passion was the Cincinnati  Reds!  When Dad was 16, he and one of his buddies  camped out in line for 36 hours to get tickets  for the 1939 World Series, when the Reds  were playing the Yankees. They ended up in  two different ticket lines, but had made a  deal  that whoever got up  to  the  ticket  counter before the tickets ran out would buy  two. Dad was able to get two tickets, but  then he couldn’t find his friend. It got close  to game time, and Dad had to go inside the  ballpark.  When he was inside, though, he went up to  the top deck at Crosley Field and searched  again for his friend. He looked down below,  outside  the ballpark, and  there was his  buddy, walking away in tears, empty-handed.  Dad reached into his pocket and pulled out  the silver dollar that his father had given  him and wrapped the other baseball ticket  around it. Then, he threw it over the railing,  hoping and praying that it would fall at the  feet of his friend.  Amazingly, it did—and they both watched  that game together.

This year’s Convenience Store News Hall of  Fame induction ceremony in October honored  Bill as much for his strong character, integrity  and community service as  for his business  achievements. Bill was honored for his tireless  efforts on behalf of the convenience and petroleum retailing industry and for the level of  integrity  that he has upheld over  the years.  The W. Douglass Distributing Company, which  Bill founded in 1981 and which he serves as  CEO, is a full-line distributorship and operator  of  the 15-unit Lone Star Food Stores chain  servicing the region of north Texas and southern Oklahoma. The company, which began  with just six employees, has grown to more  than 280 employees.  Throughout his career, Bill has been a tireless and effective advocate  for  the convenience and petroleum retailing industry. He has  served as chairman of the General Committee  of State Relations for the American Petroleum  Institute, chairman of the National Association  of Convenience Stores and director of  the  Texas Petroleum and Convenience Store Association, and he has testified on several occasions before Congress about issues important to his industry.  Bill  is also a widely  recognized and  respected member of the north Texas community, providing financial support and volunteer  efforts  to  various  local organizations each  year.  In 2002 he and his wife, Joan, were  named as the Outstanding Employer of Older  Workers for their strong belief in the value of  older workers by maintaining an age-balanced  group of employees. Their winning combination of younger workers and their older counterparts  has  created  a work  environment  where age and experience can assist in training, advice and counseling. The company has  no mandatory  retirement age and provides  flexibility in scheduling of employees’ hours.  Madam Speaker, Bill Douglass is the kind of  employer who leads by example. These are  some of the words that his employees used to  describe him and his  family  in a  full-page  newspaper ad:  ‘‘wonderful,  inspirational, brilliant, graceful, generous, charitable,  tireless,  encouraging, selfless, devoted, integrity.’’ Bill  Douglass embodies all of those qualities—and  I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing  this wonderful man and outstanding  American, Bill Douglass.

The event will serve  not only as an opportunity  to showcase  the  improvements to the campus and to reaffirm  its commitment to excellence in higher learning, but it will also serve as a chance to reflect  on  the bravery and heroism of one of East  Chicago’s own.  Ivy Tech Community College’s East Chicago  campus has served students from Northwest  Indiana and beyond since 1994. Always committed to improving the learning environment  for  its students,  the De La Garza campus,  which began with 376  students and now  serves an impressive enrollment of 1,122 students, recently completed the first phase of a  modernization  project.  This  project, which  began in July 2006, features improvements to  general maintenance and enhanced  safety  measures, as well as new and improved conference  rooms and student common areas.  Phase II of this project, set to begin in January  2009, will focus on improvements to the classrooms and computer labs.  These renovations are the result of the continuous outpouring of support from the community, offered as a living memory of one of  Northwest Indiana’s finest citizens and greatest heroes, Lance Corporal Emilio A. De La  Garza, Jr. Lance Corporal De La Garza was  born  in East Chicago,  Indiana on June 23,  1949. Following his graduation from East Chicago Washington High School in 1968, the patriotic and devoted De La Garza decided  to  serve his country and enlisted in the United  States Marine Corps. While serving as a machine gunner with Company E, Second Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division in  the Republic of Vietnam on April 11, 1970,  Lance Corporal De La Garza paid the ultimate  sacrifice. Demonstrating the most selfless act  imaginable,  Lance Corporal De  La Garza  placed himself between two of his fellow Marines and a  live grenade. While Lance Corporal De La Garza’s life was lost, his courageous act spared the lives of the other Marines.  Lance Corporal Emilio De La Garza, Jr. performed  the ultimate act of heroism, setting  aside personal safety for the safety of others.  For his bravery, Lance Corporal De La Garza  was posthumously honored by President Richard Nixon with the nation’s highest honor, the  Medal of Honor.  Madam Speaker,  I ask you and my other  distinguished colleagues  to  join me  in commending  Ivy Tech Community College’s administrators, faculty, staff, students and members of the community who, over the years,  have contributed to its success in achieving its  standard of excellence, as well as in honoring  the school’s namesake, Lance Corporal Emilio  Albert De La Garza, Jr. The efforts of those involved have made the De La Garza campus  a tremendous source of pride of Indiana’s First  Congressional District, and  they have made  the campus a constant  reminder of one of  Northwest Indiana’s finest citizens.  f  HONORING AL AUSTIN ON THE  OCCASION OF HIS 80TH BIRTHDAY  HON.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of one of Tampa Bay’s finest citizens, Al  Austin, ont he occasion of his upcoming 80th  birthday.  A lifelong Floridian, Al grew up on his family’s egg farm in St. Petersburg. After his high  school graduation and college at the University of Tampa, Al  joined  the Coast Guard,  where he performed admirably  in service  to  our Nation.  Following his military service, Al partnered  with his family to start a real estate development busienss  in  the Tampa Bay  region.  Since  then his  family-owned company has  contined to grow and helped build the greater  Tampa community. Without his influence the  Tampa St. Pete region would not be the economic growth engine  for  the State  that  it  is  today.  In addition to his success in real estate, Al  and his wife Beverly share a passion for education. After founding the Tampa Preparatory  School  in  the 1970s,  they went on  to  lead  fundraising campaigns  for  the  refurbishment  and growth of the University of Tampa campus. Their commitment to local charitable organizations has truly benefitted thousands of  people throughout the region.  In his spare  time, Al  loves  to collect and  drive classic sports cars. He has also earned  a reputation as one of the leading Republicans  in Florida, having worked with State and national  leaders  for  the past 40 years  to help  grow and expand the party. Al has also served  various Florida Governors throughout his career as the head of the Florida Racing Commission, a member of the Hillsborough Aviation Authority as well as serving on the Military  Base Closure Advisory Committee.

1562,39,2008-12-09,Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 99 extraordinary years in the life of Bromma Pemberton-  Linville. Born to a large family in the coal-mining community of Oliver Springs, Tennessee,  Bromma from an early age set an example for  all who believe in the values of family, church  and a strong community. Bromma cared  for  her six younger siblings  through elementary  and high school, and made certain to attend  Sunday church services in addition to Sunday  night youth  fellowship, a Wednesday night  prayer meeting, church play  rehearsals and  choir practice.  After graduating  from Oliver Springs High  School, Bromma went on  to Knoxville Business College and set out  to build a career.  Following a period of odd jobs to make ends  meet, Bromma finally put her business skills to  work as a secretary and bookkeeper at  the  First National Bank  in Oneida, Tennessee.  Throughout what would become a lifetime of  service  to  the bank, Bromma worked nearly  every possible position before becoming  the  first female officer and director, as well as the  first senior vice president.  But Bromma’s success at the First National  Bank in Oneida never interfered with her commitment to family. When her father became ill  and unable to work, Bromma proudly accepted  her role as a breadwinner and caretaker for  the family. After she had seen to the success  of her six younger siblings, who married and  moved out of their home, Bromma continued  to live with her parents whom she cared for  until they passed away years later. Only then  did she marry her  twenty year suitor, Roy  Johnson.  Bromma’s commitment  to her community  continued throughout her life and in to today.  From her presidency over  the Oneida Business and Professional Women’s Club to representing Scott County at the Conference on  Consumer Affairs, Bromma was actively  involved in making the world around her better  for  future generations. With  the help of her  husband, Bromma even went on to establish  the Grover Pemberton Agricultural Endowment  Fund for the University of Tennessee Agricultural Institute.  Our great country cannot do enough  to  thank the men and women who devote their  lives to the betterment of their communities. In  these difficult times of international and economic turmoil, it is the efforts of extraordinary  women  like Bromma Pemberton-Linville  that  will always help us to move this great country  forward.  f  HONORING ROBERT C.

Bob is a man of strong ideals and integrity.  I first met Bob when we were in our first  year of law school at McGeorge Law School  in California. Our friendship began then and  has been strong ever since. After law school,  Bob and  I went our  separate ways. Bob  worked  first at  the State Lands Commission  and then had a private law practice. I went to  work  in  the California State Senate  in Sacramento. Ten years later I was elected to the  U.S. House of Representatives, and when  I  became Chairman of  the Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power, I encouraged  Bob to become the staff director of the committee. He graciously accepted  the position,  and he and his lovely wife, Joyce, moved to  the Washington area.  In  the six years he  served as staff director he assisted in moving  a number of difficult pieces of legislation and  helped the subcommittee conduct many critical oversight hearings and more than a dozen  General Accounting Office investigations.  Bob was born in Kansas City, Missouri and  grew up  in Oregon, Michigan,  Indiana and  California. He attended high school in La Sierra, California. Bob has the gift of being able  to teach people in both personal and professional situations. As early as high school, Bob  showed his talent for teaching. He would often  help tutor his fellow students at his home, and  eventually the group got so large that one of  the students asked the teacher if Bob could  teach the class, since he was able to better  relate to his peers. The teacher allowed Bob  to teach the class for about 2 weeks under his  supervision.  After high school, Bob attended Andrews  University in Southwestern Michigan where he  majored in journalism. He earned his undergraduate degree in three years after successfully testing out of one year of classes. While  at Andrews, he met Joyce in the communications department, and the two have been married  for 35 years now. They have one son,  Robert Jr., who is 14 years old.  After law school, Bob frequently volunteered  in support of community activities in the Sacramento area. He volunteered as an  international moot court justice at the McGeorge  law school. He taught bible classes at his local  church. He co-founded the local neighborhood  association where he lived. And he helped organize a group of fellow bank customers to recover their savings after the financial institution where they had deposits failed.  Although he  remains active professionally  as an attorney, Bob still enjoys  teaching as  the opportunities present themselves. He has  recently started writing a series of articles  combining history, religion, and science.  I am very grateful for Bob’s friendship, and  I look forward to the many years ahead we  have as  friends.  I wish him and his  family  much happiness and success.  f  HONORING BRYCE MATTHEW  MCDONALD  HON. SAM GRAVES  OFMISSOURI  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 9, 2008  ",2008
