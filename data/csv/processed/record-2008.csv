0,House,110,-0.531,4,2008-01-23,Ms. WATSON.," Today, I join my colleagues, Madam Speaker, to override  the President’s veto of H.R. 3963, which  the President vetoed on December 12.  Since then, we received more discouraging news regarding the growing domestic and global economic crisis. It is  imperative that we look at the impact  of the downturn on our Nation’s children. A  slowing economy will definitely lead to an increased demand nationwide for SCHIP services.  Overriding  the President’s veto of  SCHIP is more critical than ever during this period of economic downturn. I  urge my colleagues to join me to override the President’s veto and to guarantee that sufficient funding levels to  address the need of our Nation’s uninsured children become a reality.  f  ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE  (Mr. STEARNS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2008
1,House,110,0.554,4,2008-01-23,Mr. STEARNS.," As Congress  contemplates an economic stimulus package to aid our slowing economy, we  also must commit ourselves to reduce  Federal spending.  As American families tighten their  budgets to weather this impending economic storm, Congress should match  their sacrifice. While reducing taxes is  important, another aspect is to control  the Federal deficits, the Federal spending. A decrease in wasteful spending  would directly increase the value of the  dollar and ultimately lower deficits.  The American people and businesses  are better at deciding what to do with  their money than the Federal Government. With more money in their hands,  an increase in investment in our economy and in increase in personal savings would take hold and ultimately  lead to a stronger and growing economy.  As we in Congress consider this one-  time stimulus package over the next  few weeks, I contend that a long-term  solution to this problem is to lower  spending, which will in turn lead to  lower taxes and a permanent economic  bounce and revitalization.  f  FIGHTING POVERTY  (Mr. JEFFERSON  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2008
2,House,110,-0.424,4,2008-01-23,Mr. JEFFERSON.," Madam Speaker, I  rise to thank Representative BARBARA  LEE for passing her resolution yesterday committing our Nation to  fight  poverty.  Nowhere is this commitment and action needed more than in the City of  New Orleans.  Ironically, on the day  that the levees broke in New Orleans,  21⁄2years ago, the Census Bureau was  releasing its report on poverty, showing that Orleans Parish had a poverty  rate of 23.2 percent, seventh highest in  the 290 large counties in America. Thirty-five percent of the city’s African  American population  is classified as  poor. Seventy-seven percent of the students  in New Orleans participate  in  free or reduced-cost  lunch programs.  Pre-Katrina African Americans made  up 67 percent of New Orleans, but 84  percent of its population is below the  poverty line. And it is mostly in its 47  neighborhoods  of  extreme  poverty  where our citizens are still out of town,  unable to return and share in the rebuilding of New Orleans.  So the commitment of our Nation  must not be just to recover the City of  New Orleans, but also to focus on the  peculiar needs of its impoverished citizens, needs  existing  before Katrina  made much more desperate since.  f  ECONOMIC STIMULUS  (Mr. HERGER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2008
3,House,110,0.551,4,2008-01-23,Mr. HERGER.," Madam Speaker, today’s economic debate should focus on  big picture tax policies that emphasize  sustained  prosperity  for  American  workers and their families.  A  one-time,  consumption-driven  stimulus may be popular, but what we  really need is tax relief that will energize economic growth. We need certainty for our industry which is currently making  tomorrow’s  business  plans today based on the assumption  that taxes are going to increase dramatically.  We should also reduce tax rates on  our companies  from the highest tax  rates in the world to instead placing  American employers on an even tax  footing globally.  Madam Speaker,  today’s  economy  didn’t happen overnight, and tomorrow’s growth and prosperity will depend on our commitment to bold, forward-looking tax policies now.  f  ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam  Speaker, I have risen several times on  the floor of the House to encourage my  colleagues to consider the mortgage  crisis when we talk about an economic  stimulus package.  It is well known that an economic  stimulus package should stimulate and  it should be driven by existing law. But  there is no reason why we cannot find  a connector for a 90-day moratorium, a  moratorium on those who are about to  go over the brink and provide a freeze  on those adjustable rates. An economic  stimulus package is to stimulate. What  more stimulation than for people to  keep their homes and pay their mortgages.  Might I also say that as the mortgage collapse goes, then families are  subject to not having their children  covered by the SCHIP program. The debate today will be enormously important because it will cost less than $3.50  a day to provide for these children. And  as well, it will help States all over the  Nation, including the 1 million children  in Texas  that no  longer have  health insurance because of this horrific veto.  We need a stimulus package that provides people with housing and a stimulus package that takes care of our  children.  f  b1045  THE BEST ECONOMIC STIMULUS IS  A JOB  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2008
4,House,110,0.616,4,2008-01-23,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Madam Speaker,  I think we all know that the best economic stimulus is a job. It is a job that  you can sink your teeth into, that you  can go to work every day and you can  use this job to provide for your family.  So, as the debate ensues, let’s keep our  focus on how policies affect the environment  in which  job growth takes  place. Of course we all want to see  lower marginal rates on our income tax  rate. We want to lower cap gains. We  want to lower the corporate tax rate.  We want to see full and immediate section 179 expensing for our small businesses.

5,House,110,0.385,11,2008-01-23,Mr. CAMP of Michigan.," Madam  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I think it’s important to note that  this bill allows States to document  citizenship, and  the Social Security  Administrator has said that changing  the law will make it easier for illegal  immigrants to get SCHIP funds as well  as other taxpayer-funded benefits.  And despite this being a program for  low-income children, under  this bill  three-quarters of a million adults will  still be on the program in 2012. Under  this bill more than 1.6 million children  will lose their private coverage.  And let’s talk about the funding. The  majority has created a  funding cliff  that  dramatically  increases Federal  funding to enroll new children for the  next 5 years; then cuts funding for the  bill by 80 percent. This will force future  Congresses to make a very difficult  choice: to dramatically increase funding or let American children lose their  health coverage.  The other problem with this bill is  that it is estimated that the bill, because  it relies on tobacco taxes  for  funding, would require more than 22  million new smokers. Now, if there is  any consistent policy the government  has had administration to administration it’s the discouragement of smoking. Yet this bill relies on a false funding mechanism that would require 22  million new smokers.  Madam Speaker, at this time I yield  2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. PRICE.  (Mr. PRICE of Georgia asked and was  given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2008
6,House,110,0.644,11,2008-01-23,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," I appreciate  the  gentleman’s  leadership  and his  yielding time.  Regrettably, Madam Speaker,  the  New Year didn’t bring any new ideas or  new strategy on the part of our majority here. Less than 1 week into this  new session, it remains all politics all  the time. And you don’t have to believe  me. Just listen to their chairman, who  was quoted in the New York Times on  September  17 of  last year:  ‘‘If  the  President vetoes this bill, it’s a political victory for us.’’ So all politics all  the time.  As has been stated by others, we  solved this issue for the time being, the  next 18 months, in a bipartisan manner  last year, 411–3. And don’t believe me if  you don’t want to. Believe the Atlanta  Journal-Constitution, no great friend  of our side of the aisle, which says,  ‘‘Thanks to the infusion of Federal dollars, Georgia’s embattled health insurance program for working class children is safe for another year and even  has room to grow if the economy declines. The program called PeachCare,  which was disrupted and debated last  year by State officials, Congress, and  the President, will have enough funding to cover the 254,820 children now  enrolled and to grow by up to 40,000  children.  ‘I’m just relieved,’ said the  State  Health  Department  Commissioner Dr. Rhonda Medows. ‘This will  ensure these children are taken care  of.’  ‘‘Relief echoed Monday through the  Georgia health care advocacy community, which fought throughout the last  year to save the program known as  SCHIP. ‘The advocacy community can  do nothing but rejoice.’’’ And these  comments have been voiced all around  the Nation.  Last Thursday the Congressional Research Service issued a statement to  Georgia officials  that  said  that  the  State will receive $325 million for the  2008  Federal  budget,  which  runs  through October of this year, and that  funding level is expected to continue  through March of 2009.  So this isn’t about policy. This isn’t  about policy. It’s all about politics,  self-admitted on the other side.  Vote ‘‘no.’’  ",2008
7,House,110,-0.448,11,2008-01-23,Mr. DINGELL.," Madam Speaker, at  this time I yield for the purpose of  making a unanimous consent request  to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEE).  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to revise and  extend her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam  Speaker, I rise vigorously to oppose the  President’s veto because of the 1 million children in Texas and the City of  Houston that will be left out in the  cold without health care.  Madam Speaker, as the chair of the Congressional Children’s Caucus,  I  rise  to announce that I will proudly cast my vote in support of overriding the Presidential veto of H.R.  3963,  the  ‘‘Children’s Health  Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2007.’’ I  rise  in strong support of  this  legislation because I am listening, and responding to the  will of  the American people. Last November  2006, Americans went to polls by the millions  united in their resolve to vote for change. They  voted for a new direction and a change in the  Bush administration’s disastrous neglect of the  real needs of the American people, particularly  children who lack health insurance through no  fault of their own. The new Democratic majority heard them and responded by passing H.R.  976, ‘‘State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2007.’’  The President vetoed the bill, basing his decision on the absurd and laughable claim that  the program was thinly disguised ‘‘socialized  medicine’’ and that it was too costly to provide  health insurance for America’s needy children.  The  President’s  senseless  veto  of  the  SCHIP bill suggests that this administration is  operating under  the misimpression  that  it  is  entitled to a continuation of the ancien re´gime  under which the Republican-led Congress look  askance and gave  the President a blank  check to mismanage the affairs of our Nation.  Following  the President’s  first veto,  the bill  was revised  to meet a number of concerns  raised by  the President  including ensuring  lower-income children are enrolled  first and  ensuring benefits are denied  to  illegal  immigrants. While the bill again passed the House  by a bipartisan vote of 265 to 142, moving to  the Senate where it passed by a veto-proof 64  to 30, the President again vetoed the bill and,  in so doing, denied health care to millions of  deserving American children.  No matter how many veto threats the President issues, this Congress is not going to give  him a blank check to escalate and continue  the war in Iraq or to ignore the pressing domestic needs of  the American people.  It  is  long past time for change in Iraq and in the direction of the United States. Just as the people and Government of Iraq must accept responsibility for their own country, the people’s  representatives  in Congress must  take  the  lead in addressing the real problems of real  Americans living in the real world.  H.R. 3963 is a necessary step in the right  direction because it provides dependable and  stable funding for children’s health insurance  under Titles XXI and XIX of the Social Security Act in order to enroll all 6 million uninsured  children who are eligible for coverage today,  but not enrolled. That is why I strongly support  this legislation.  Madam Speaker, next to the Iraq war, there  is no more  important  issue  facing  the Congress, the President, and the American people  than the availability of affordable health care  for all Americans, especially children. This bipartisan SCHIP bill  is supported by an astounding 81 percent of the American people  and the majority of Congress.  By vetoing the bipartisan SCHIP Authorization Act, the President vetoed the will of the  American people. By vetoing that legislation,  the President turned a deaf ear and a blind  eye to the loud message sent by the American  people last November.

11,House,110,0.458,25,2008-01-23,Mr. KELLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of House Resolution 916, offered by the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI).  This resolution  increases the awareness of Catholic education while honoring the contributions of America’s  Catholic schools.  January 27 through February 2, 2008  has been designated Catholic Schools  Week, an annual tradition in its 34th  year and jointly sponsored by the National Catholic Education Association  as well as the United States Conference  of Catholic Bishops. With this resolution we recognize the vital role Catholic elementary and secondary schools  play  in providing an education with  high standards of quality and excellence to the nearly 2.4 million students  enrolled in Catholic schools across the  country.  According to the U.S. Conference of  Catholic Bishops, Catholic schools have  a graduation rate of over 98 percent,  and about 97 percent of Catholic high  school graduates go on  to post-secondary  training  at  4-year  colleges,  community  colleges,  or  technical  schools. This success can be attributed  to the importance Catholic educators  place on  character and morals. By  making the development of moral and  social values an integral part of the  curriculum, Catholic schools are ensuring that their students are not only  good academicians but also good citizens.  The theme for Catholic Schools Week  2008  is  ‘‘Catholic Schools Light  the  Way.’’ This theme highlights the mission of Catholic schools to provide a  faith-based education that supports the  whole  child  academically  and  spiritually and prepares students for future  success.  Catholic  schools  demonstrated  an  enormous  amount  of  character  and  compassion  in their response to the  devastating hurricanes  that hit  the  gulf coast 3 years ago. In the wake of  this  national  disaster, more  than  300,000 students were displaced  from  their homes, schools, and communities.  Catholic schools opened their doors and  hearts and welcomed these students  into their classrooms. They provided  these children with the opportunity to  continue their studies without stopping to consider the cost of that education. Instead, the Catholic schools  knew their first priority was to educate these children. In addition, the  Catholic schools in New Orleans have  proved to be most resilient by becoming some of the first schools in the hurricane-damaged area to reopen their  doors to students.  I appreciate the great work done by  Catholic schools, their administrators  and teachers, as well as the parents  and volunteers. Catholic schools carry  out their servant mission by building  the academic achievement, character,  and values of their students.  I again commend the gentleman from  Illinois for introducing this resolution  and urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Ms. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2008

Res. 916 honoring the contributions of Catholic schools across the  country, for the upcoming commemoration of National Catholic Schools  Week from January 27 to February 2.  Mr. Speaker, as a graduate of Catholic elementary and high schools, Sacred Heart Academy and Aquinas High  School in Augusta, Georgia, I am keenly aware of the contributions that they  provide  to  the  2.3 million  students  across this country they teach every  year. These include 1,176 students at  three Catholic schools in my district,  the 11th of Georgia: St. Catherine of  Siena  in Kennesaw, Georgia; St. Joseph’s in my hometown of Marietta,  Georgia; and St. Mary’s in Floyd County, Rome, Georgia.  Not only do Catholic schools, like Sacred Heart and Aquinas, provide a  strong and competitive academic environment, they also teach moral and  ethical standards, skills for living and  self esteem, and a Christian integration of spirit, mind, and body in each of  their students.  b1345  Upon  graduating  from Aquinas,  I  thought that the Catholic school curriculum would be what best prepared  me for my future. But, Mr. Speaker, I  must admit that I was wrong. While  the  strenuous  academics  at Sacred  Heart and Aquinas did lay the foundation for success at Georgia Tech and  the Medical College of Georgia, it was  the faith and ethical standards taught  at these schools that truly prepared me  for life’s struggles.  Mr. Speaker, while opening and running my medical practice, the respect  for life at Sacred Heart and Aquinas  led me to value and care for life at all  stages from conception on. And now  that I have left my medical career to  serve as Member of this great body, I  find my  lessons  from these Catholic  schools more valuable than ever on a  daily basis.  We are all confronted with difficult  questions that affect millions of lives.  If it were not for the moral standards  and the faith in God taught at Sacred  Heart and Aquinas, I do not believe  that I could properly represent the people of northwest Georgia.  So, Mr. Speaker, Catholic schools in  northwest Georgia and all across our  great country provide an  incredible  valuable service to our education system and truly prepare their students  for a bright future.  I urge all of my colleagues, support  H. Res. 916.  Ms. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, if I could inquire  from my colleague how many more  speakers he has remaining.  ",2008

In Ohio, approximately 12 percent of  school children are educated by private  institutions with  the vast majority  going  to  Catholic  schools.  These  schools provide the structure and value  system that are  important to their  families as their children receive not  only a quality education but a strong  moral and social foundation.  Most  importantly, the choice of a  Catholic education allows children to  have a religious bearing in their education. Many parents make great sacrifices for their children’s education by  sending them to Catholic school, because at the same time they are not  only paying  for  that Catholic  education, but they also have to pay taxes  to the public schools.  I applaud the hard work and dedication  of  the  staff  at  the Catholic  schools, as well as the parents who  seek this education  for their child’s  betterment. I am pleased to support  House Resolution 916 today and to support our Catholic schools in Ohio and  across this great country.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2008

15,House,110,-0.529,32,2008-01-23,Mr. HONDA.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in support of H. Res. 932.  This resolution signifies Congress’s appreciation for the critical work school counselors  do to provide students and their families with  guidance and support, both academic and  emotional, toward obtaining a higher education  and entrance into the workforce.  In his 2008 budget, President Bush proposed eliminating federal support for elementary and secondary school counselors. Under  Democratic  leadership,  the President’s proposal was wisely rejected and this Congress  provided nearly $14 million of additional support to school counseling programs, for a total  of over $48 million. I am proud of this accomplishment, but  feel  there  is still more  to be  done to meet the needs of our children.  In California, eight in nine high school students attend a school with fewer counselors  than  the national average. This makes California the State with the highest counselor to  student ratio in the Nation; over two times the  School Counseling Association’s  suggested  ratio. Students attending intensely segregated  minority  schools are most  likely  to attend  schools with  fewer counselors  than  the national average. Addressing  the school counselor deficit is a critical component of closing  the achievement gap that plagues our Nation.  As we reflect on  the vital role counselors  play in the lives of our children, we should remember that investing in our schools is an investment in our future; it is the best investment our country can make.  School counselors create pathways to success and H. Res. 932 will ensure our Nation  comes  together  this February  to  recognize  their vital contributions.  ",2008

I also  thank the many Members of Congress that decided to cosponsor this resolution, especially  Chairman MILLER and Ranking Republican  MCKEON.  School counselors are instrumental in helping our students face daily challenges. They  help develop well-rounded students by guiding  them through their academic, personal, social,  and career development.  School counselors also play a vital role in  ensuring that students are prepared for their  future. They may encourage students to pursue challenging academic courses to prepare  them  for  college majors  and  careers  in  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.  I certainly recognize that school counselors  contribute  to  the success of students  in our  schools, and I encourage all Members to join  me in supporting this resolution.  Ms. LINDA T.

Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 3971,  the Death in Custody Reporting Act of  2007, and commend Chairman CONYERS,  Crime Subcommittee Chairman SCOTT,  and  Crime  Subcommittee  Ranking  Member GOHMERT for their commitment to this bipartisan legislation.  The Death in Custody Reporting Act  of 2000 directed the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics to  collect data on deaths that occur in the  process of arrest or during transfer  after arrest, as well as deaths that  occur in jails and prisons.  H.R. 3971 reauthorizes this data collection program and directs the Attorney General to commission a study to  determine how to reduce deaths in custody and to examine the relationship  between deaths  in custody and  the  management of jail and prison facilities.  The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that between 2001 and 2005 there  were 15,308 State prisoner deaths. The  bureau also reports that there were  5,935 local prisoner deaths and 43 juvenile deaths between 2000 and 2005.  Half of all State prisoner deaths are  the result of heart disease and cancer.  Two-thirds involved inmates age 45 or  older, and another two-thirds are the  result of medical problems that were  present at the time of admission.  Although illness-related deaths have  slightly increased in recent years, the  homicide and suicide rates  in State  prisons have dramatically decreased  over the last 25 years. That is positive  news, but we still need to collect data  to monitor these trends.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2008
19,House,110,-0.274,60,2008-01-23,Mr. WALZ of Minnesota.," Well, anyone who listens tonight, Madam Speaker, to the gentleman’s accounts is horrified. And I think to put it into context, make no mistake about it, what  happened today in the signing of the  Department of Defense authorization  bill with these provisions taken out to  allow recourse on this is, it is pretty  difficult for me to see any way that a  decision was made to side with the  monsters who carried out this torture  and not with those brave Americans  who went at this country’s call, did our  bidding, and then came home to the so-  called open arms. And as  the gentleman said, having spent 24 years in  the National Guard, having  trained  countless soldiers, many, as you said,  served in my unit. I taught them in  school. I coached them on the football  field. One of the things that was very  clear in part of our training, because,  of course, it held to those core values  of being an American, was the respect  for the Geneva Convention.  The Geneva Convention did several  very  important things. As I said,  it  upheld those principles of, even in a  conflict situation, that the humanity  and the humane treatment of other individuals was absolutely paramount to  keeping with the ideals of this Nation.  There was also something else very,  very important with the Geneva Convention that many of us as soldiers always came to rely upon  is knowing  that if you adhere to these things, that  if other combatants, the enemy you  were fighting understood that, one of  the things you could do was you could  convince people that it might be better  to give up the fight. It might be better  because you know you will be treated  humanely. And there was always great  comfort, because it is not the fear of  injury, it is not the fear of battle which  is there amongst all these soldiers, it is  the fear of capture and torture and saying something that may hurt your fellow soldiers that has everyone terrified.  So the idea is that the Geneva Convention was held in the highest esteem.  The principles that it was set by were  there to make sure that even at the  base emotions of war amongst human  beings that there was a respect  for  basic human life. There was a respect  when someone was unarmed and unable  to fight, that when someone was captured, they would be treated as humanely as possible. And with  that  being pulled back, I have to tell you, it  terrifies me.  And these forgotten warriors are forgotten because they happen to be an  inconvenience now. They happen to be  an  inconvenience to a political  ideology. They happen to be an inconvenience  because  this  administration  doesn’t want to follow the Geneva Convention. This administration, I believe,  and members of this administration  have called it a quaint, outdated notion that is no longer there. I would  argue that soldiers don’t see it that  way. Soldiers see it as a necessity.  And for many of us, as my colleague  has pointed out, it is hard to fathom  that an administration that has talked  so much about our soldiers would so  callously brush aside 17, in this society, 17 warriors held in the highest esteem as a prisoner of war for their Nation and to cast them aside and cut  their rights off to any type of recourse.  And I can’t help but see a pattern here  of where the administration’s loyalties  lie. As Americans are struggling, and  we hear about it every day, the economic crisis, they are struggling to  make ends meet, and they see $102 a  barrel oil. But I don’t know where that  is able to be rectified in their mind  when they see the President walking  hand in hand with the Saudi Prince  and knowing that every bit of that $102  is going into the pockets of the Saudi  Princes, going into nations and going  into, in this case, a regime that committed the grievous atrocities against  our soldiers and was totally absolved  down on Pennsylvania Avenue against  the wishes of the 100 elected Senators,  against the wishes of the 435 elected  Members of this body. And yet tonight,  several of us stand here. And I think  the outrage and the passion that my  colleague from Iowa has shown should  be reassuring to the American public  that there is a voice there. There is a  voice  in  the wilderness. There  is a  voice that says this is wrong. This is a  wrong that should not be allowed to  stand. This is a wrong that I think  they want to see, my colleague from  Iowa, myself and our colleagues here,  stand and speak for what is right.  So again, I can only come to the conclusion, and I ask my colleague if he  can find another way of seeing this,  what was the benefit of the administration’s decision to side with the Hussein  regime over U.S. POWs who were tortured? I am still trying to find where  there  is  justification.  It doesn’t go  back to  ‘‘we can’t hamper the Iraqi  from rebuilding,’’ because they are not  doing that as it is. It can’t go back to  any precedence. It is in violation of the  Geneva Convention, and it flies in the  face, as my colleague said, of our basic  principles of our Constitution. So I am  trying to figure how we would be able  to sell this to the American public.  ",2008
20,House,110,-0.31,60,2008-01-23,Mr. BRALEY of Iowa.," Well, Madam  Speaker, I think my friend from Minnesota has hit this one on the head, because one of the things you were talking about is the administration’s interpretation of what our treaty obligations are under the Geneva Convention.  And maybe it all boils down to this  very simple question: When is torture  torture? Because you brought up the  fact that our own Government, our own  Justice Department, seems to have a  difficult time interpreting acts such as  waterboarding,  that  I  think  every  American who has seen the video illustrating what that is would conclude  that it constitutes torture in violation  of the third Geneva Convention. And  yet it is hard for us as a people and as  a government to try to say, we need to  stand up to other countries who are  torturing our POWs if we can’t get it  ourselves in terms of our obligations  under the Geneva Convention. I think  it gets to a much more fundamental  question, which is, are we going to be  the type of country that stands by our  word when we enter  in these  international treaties? These treaties are  designed not just to protect American  prisoners of war but to make sure that  the countries that we may be in conflict with have the same respect for  human  rights,  human  dignity  and  human decency for captured prisoners  that we would expect our men and  women in uniform to be subjected to.  To give you some idea of how this  plays out in the real world, I would remind my  friend  from Minnesota of  what happened to Lieutenant Colonel  Berryman, one of the people I identified as the POWs that brought this  claim.  b1800  This really gets to the heart of many  of those constitutional protections I  talked about earlier.  Lieutenant Colonel Berryman was inspected after he was captured to determine whether he was circumcised and  was  questioned  about  his  religion.  When he answered he was a Baptist, his  captors called him a  lying Jew. A  guard then hit his left leg below the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:40 Mar 27, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD08\RECFILES\H23JA8.REC H23JA8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008

63,Senate,110,0.208,81,2008-01-23,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  thank the chairman of the committee  for his great cooperation on this very  important  issue. I know we had all  hoped—certainly my constituents had  hoped, and I think my colleagues as  well, as so many around the country  who have been waiting years—literally  waiting a decade—for reauthorization  of this Indian Health Care Improvement Act. We are pleased that we are  on the floor. We would like to see this  moved through the process as quickly  as possible. We understand the issues  we have in front of us and what we  have to do in order to get this through,  but I appreciate the great leadership of  the chairman of  the  Indian Affairs  Committee and of so many who have  worked to advance this legislation.  I thank Chairman DORGAN for reminding all of us of the great contributions we have had from so many of our  American  Indians,  Alaska  Natives,  when it comes to serving our country.  I think if you look at the demographics  and look at it on a per-capita basis, we  see higher numbers, certainly in Alaska, of our Alaska Natives serving in  the military  than any other populations in the State, serving admirably  over the years, whether they be the Eskimo Scouts or whether they be the  group serving from the National Guard  which recently returned from Kuwait.  I had an opportunity a couple of  months ago to meet those Alaskans  who were returning.  I met up with  them in Camp Shelby and had an opportunity to talk to the men who were  returning from Kuwait after well over  a year. They had been in the desert.  Most of these soldiers came from villages  from around the State. There  were some 80 villages—communities—  that were  represented amongst  this  particular unit. Many of them, when  they returned back home to Alaska  after coming from the desert and going  home to the snow, would be returning  to very small towns and very small villages that are not connected by any  form of a road system. During the winter months, you have connection because the rivers are now frozen and you  can take a snow machine to get from  one small village to another and hopefully out to a larger hub community.  But the reality is so many of these fine  men who have served our country are  going back to areas where health care  options are very limited.

65,Senate,110,-0.308,88,2008-01-23,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Madam President, I  am  pleased  to  support  the  Indian  Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007. This bill is long overdue,  and I hope that we in the Senate can  ensure this bill’s quick passage.  There are significant unmet needs in  Indian Country  throughout  this Nation, and addressing the unmet health  care needs ranks as one of the most  significant  issues  that we must address. The Federal Government has a  well-established  trust  responsibility  with regard to American Indian affairs,  and this trust responsibility extends to  providing good health care to communities throughout Indian Country.  I am impressed with the bipartisan  work that Senator DORGAN and the  Senate Indian Affairs Committee have  put into moving this bill forward, and  I commend the committee for its dedication to significant consultation with  Indian Country in drafting and negotiating this bill. Because of the strong  consultation with individual tribes and  collective organizations  like the National Tribal Steering Committee and  the National Indian Health Board, the  Senate Indian Affairs Committee has  put together a comprehensive reform  bill that will help improve the health  care services available to American Indians around the country.  This bill has the support of tribal  governments throughout the Nation,  including the 11  federally recognized  tribes in my State of Wisconsin. I have  heard from a number of constituents in  Wisconsin about the need to pass this  important piece of legislation and the  improvements that the legislation will  make to various Indian Health Service  programs including clinical programs,  on the various reservations throughout  the State and the urban Indian program in the city of Milwaukee.  Health care is consistently the No. 1  issue that I hear about all over my  home State of Wisconsin. When I hold  my annual townhall meetings across  the State, many people come to tell me  about problems with our overall health  care system, and data shows us that  these problems are often most acutely  felt in Indian Country. Lack of access  to good health care is a problem that  disproportionately  affects  American  Indians throughout the United States.  According to the Indian Health Service, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 200 percent more likely to die  from diabetes, more than 500 percent  more  likely to die  from alcoholism,  and approximately 500 percent more  likely to die from tuberculosis.  I was disappointed to hear one of my  colleagues say yesterday on the floor  that American lives do not depend on  whether we pass the Indian health care  bill by the end of the month.

There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  U.S. SENATE,  Washington, DC, January 17, 2008.  Hon. BANKI-MOON,  Secretary-General of the United Nations,  United Nations Headquarters, New York, NY.  DEARSECRETARY-GENERAL: By letter dated  January 2, 2008, 1 requested that the United  Nations initiate an investigation into the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. With this letter, I am  enclosing for you a copy of that letter and  would appreciate a response.  After considering the matter further and  watching developments, it is my view that  the United Nations should organize a standing commission to investigate assassinations  which would have international importance.  We are seeing terrorism, supplemented by assassinations,  becoming  commonplace  to  achieve political objectives.  While a United Nations investigation into  the assassination of former Prime Minister  Bhutto  is still something that should be  done, it would obviously have been much  better to have had a unit in existence which  could  be  immediately  dispatched  to  the  scene to investigate the locale as soon as  possible and to interrogate witnesses while  their memories are fresh and before others  might try to stop them from talking.  I would very much appreciate your response on these important matters.  Sincerely,  ARLENSPECTER.  f  SPECTER STATE SECRETS PROTECTION ACT  ",2008
67,Senate,110,-0.443,109,2008-01-23,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, yesterday, Senator SPECTER and I introduced  the State Secrets Protection  Act. I have been working on this bill  with  Senator  for  several  months, and I thank him for his commitment and leadership on this very  important issue. I hope that our collaboration on this legislation will demonstrate that even the most sensitive  problems can be addressed through bipartisan cooperation if we keep the interests of the Nation front-and-center  and roll up our sleeves to do the work  of seeking a realistic and workable solution. The State Secrets Protection  Act is an essential response to a pressing need.  For years, there has been growing  concern about the state secrets privilege. It is a common law privilege that  lets the Government protect sensitive  national  security  information  from  being disclosed as evidence in litigation. The problem is that sometimes  plaintiffs may need that information to  show that their rights were violated. If  the privilege is not applied carefully,  the Government can use it as a tool for  cover up by withholding evidence that  is not actually sensitive. The state secrets privilege is important, but there  is a risk it will be overused and abused.  The privilege was first recognized by  the Supreme Court in 1953, and it has  been asserted since then by every administration, Republican and Democratic. Under the Bush administration,  however, use of the state secrets privilege has dramatically  increased and  the harmful consequences of its irregular application by courts have become  painfully clear.  Injured plaintiffs have been denied  justice, courts have failed to address  fundamental  questions  of  constitutional rights and separation of powers,  and confusion pervades this area of  law. The Senate debate on reforming  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act has become far more difficult than  it ought to be because many believe  that  if courts hear  lawsuits against  telecommunications  companies,  the  courts will be unable to deal fairly and  effectively with the Government’s invocation of the privilege.  Studies show that the Bush administration has raised the privilege in over  25 percent more cases per year than  previous  administrations  and  has  sought dismissal  in over  90 percent  more cases. As one scholar recently  noted, this administration has used the  privilege to ‘‘seek blanket dismissal of  every case challenging the constitutionality of specific, ongoing government programs’’ related to its war on  terrorism, and as a result, the privilege  is impairing the ability of Congress and  the judiciary to perform their constitutional duty to check executive power.  Another  leading  scholar  recently  found that  ‘‘in practical terms, the  state  secrets privilege never  fails.’’  Like  other  commentators,  he  concluded that ‘‘the state secrets privilege  is the most powerful secrecy privilege  available to the president,’’ and ‘‘the  people of the United States have suffered needlessly because the law is now  a servant to executive claims of national security.’’  In 1980, Congress enacted the Classified  Information  Procedures  Act—  known as CIPA—to provide Federal  courts with clear statutory guidance  on handling secret evidence in criminal  cases. For almost 30 years, courts have  effectively applied that law to make  criminal trials fairer and safer. During  that period, Congress has also regulated judicial review of national security materials under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Because of  these laws, Federal judges regularly review and handle highly classified evidence in many types of cases.  Yet,  in civil cases,  litigants have  been left behind. Congress has failed to  provide clear rules or standards for determining whether  evidence  is  protected by the state secrets privilege.  We have failed to develop procedures  that will protect injured parties and  also prevent the disclosure of sensitive  information. Because use of the state  secrets privilege has escalated in recent years, there is an increasing need  for the judiciary and the executive to  have clear, fair, and safe rules.  Many have recognized the need for  congressional guidance on this issue.

68,,110,0.407,137,2008-01-23,Mr. FORBES.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to recognize my pastor and dear friend, Rev.  Charles L. Moseley on the occasion of his retirement  from nearly 40 years of service as  pastor of Great Bridge Baptist Church  in  Chesapeake, VA.  Charles Moseley was born in Camden, SC,  the fifth child and only son of Fred and Julia  Moseley. Growing up in a small town, Charles  felt the influence of his godly mother and father. One evening in October 1949 after a revival service at First Baptist of Camden, while  Charles and his  friends were watching an  eclipse of the moon, he felt the call of God to  full-time Christian ministry.  Charles started his higher education achieving his associate of arts degree from Wingate  Jr. College in January 1952. He went on to receive his bachelor of arts degree in English  from Coker College  in January 1954. Continuing to be led by the Lord, Charles then entered Southeastern Seminary at Wake Forest,  NC, and graduated with a bachelor of divinity  in January 1958. He later earned a master of  divinity  from Southeastern Seminary  in  the  early 1970s. Throughout  these years of college, Charles continued to see God’s hand on  his life in many ways through financial help,  mentoring from professors, and preaching in  churches in the area.  During  his  time  at  seminary,  Charles  preached  in many churches but was  led  to  pastor two churches in Dillon County, SC. He  would  travel between  the  two churches on  Sunday preaching at one at 10 a.m. and the  other at 11 a.m. It was during this time in December 1956 that he met his future wife, Louise Martin. At the time, Lou was serving as  education director of the First Baptist Church  of Dillon, SC. They were married  in June  1957.  As a senior at seminary, many offers from  churches came for him to serve as pastor but  Charles was not led to any of them until he received  an  offer  from  a  small  church  in  Valdese, NC,  in early 1958. Abee’s Grove  Baptist was a small country church located in  the mountains of North Carolina with a Sunday morning attendance between 100 to 150  people.  Pastor Moseley and his  family  left  this  church in 1962 to begin a ministry at the First  Baptist Church of Carthage, NC. Located near  Pinehurst, NC, First Baptist was a dignified little church with a beautiful pipe organ, stained  glass windows and friendly congregation.  From the beginning of his studies, Charles  had  the desire  to be a chaplain  in  the Air  Force but that was not the Lord’s path for him.  He did however, serve in the National Guard  and proudly retired  from  the U.S. Army Reserve with 23 years of service.  Even  in  the  beginning  of  his ministry,  Charles had always thought he would be the  pastor of a small church, never imaging that  the Lord would lead him to shepherd a large,  vibrant, and growing church. However, in 1969  Charles and his family felt the call to Great  Bridge Baptist Church, a church of 650 members  in  a  rural  area  near Norfolk,  VA.  Throughout his ministry at Great Bridge Baptist, Pastor Moseley has always maintained  that he  is a pastor  first, serving his people  wherever their needs are. His greatest desire  is  to  be  a  servant  reaching  out  to  his  congregants  during  their most  important  times—marriage, birth, death, crisis, sickness,  sorrow, fear, joy.  When asked what he would say is a highlight of his ministry at Great Bridge Baptist,  Pastor Moseley recalled that one of the greatest of his delights  is experiencing someone  coming  to know  the Lord. The blessing of  leading a person  to know Christ as his/her  Savior is the joy of his life.  Madam Speaker, in the nearly 40 years of  service at Great Bridge Baptist Church, Pastor  Moseley has steadfastly led his congregation  in the footsteps of Christ, touching thousands  of lives with the joy and peace of the Lord.  Through the many years that my family and I  have attended Great Bridge Baptist,  I have  come to know Rev. Moseley as a model of  selfless service and great spiritual leadership.  Today we thank him for his service to us and  most importantly his service to the Lord and  we ask God’s special blessing on him and his  family as they pursue the joys and challenges  of this next phase of his life.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

Res. 866 and wish the RECORD to reflect my intentions had I been able to vote.  Had  I been present  for rollcall No. 19 on  suspending the rules and passing H.R. 4211,  naming the Judge Richard B.

DONALD A. MANZULLO  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 23, 2008  ",2008
70,,110,0.51,137,2008-01-23,Mr. MANZULLO.," Madam  Speaker,  last  week, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO,  released  its  report outlining options  for  reLIPINSKI,  ERIC BILL CANTOR, WALLY  sponding to the Nation’s short-term economic  weakness. One key finding of the report contains a warning: Any stimulus that a short-term  economic package ‘‘can provide to the economy depends on how much of the resultant  spending goes to purchase domestically produced goods. The degree of stimulus that a  policy can provide  to  the economy also depends on how much of the resultant spending  goes  to  purchase  domestically  produced  goods. If the additional consumption, or investment, demand is satisfied by imported goods,  the income of foreign producers will rise, and  the stimulus essentially will be exported.’’  Simply put,  the benefits of  the proposed  $145 billion U.S. economic stimulus package  should not go abroad. The benefits of  this  package should help Americans as much as  possible. That’s why I, along with Representatives  HERGER, and JEFFFORTENBERRY, am proud to  introduce  today  the American Jobs Creation  and Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. This bill  will provide a quick power boost to the economy that does not cost too much and rewards  companies  for keeping and adding  jobs  in  America. This proposal simply accelerates the  phase-in of  the domestic manufacturing  tax  benefit by 2 years. Any economic stimulus  package that is crafted by Congress should include this provision.  The domestic manufacturing tax deduction,  now section 199 of the U.S. Tax Code, started  in 2005 at 3 percent as part of the 2004 law  that replaced the Foreign Sales Corporation/  Extraterritorial Income, FSC/ETI tax structure,  which was ruled as an illegal export subsidy  by the World Trade Organization, WTO. Last  year, the domestic manufacturing tax deduction increased to 6 percent. The final phase—  raising the domestic manufacturing deduction  to 9 percent—is scheduled  to start  in 2010.  The American Jobs Creations and Economic  Stimulus Act of 2008 simply changes the start  date of the 9 percent domestic manufacturing  tax deduction from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2008,  thus providing an additional 3  percent tax incentive for all domestic manufacturers right now.  According to the Internal Revenue Service,  IRS, 378,627 small and large manufacturers,  as broadly defined by the U.S. Treasury, were  helped by this benefit in 2005. One year later,  that number grew  to over 400,000. The domestic manufacturing benefit applies to firms  of all types—C Corporations, S Corporations,  Limited Liability Companies, LLCs, and sole  proprietorships.  This tax deduction is ideal because it only  applies  to  revenue generated by operations  based in the United States and discourages  the ‘‘off-shoring’’ of American production. No  other economic stimulus idea ties tax relief to  requiring companies  to keep production and  jobs in the United States. The American Jobs  Creation and Economic Stimulus Act of 2008  is a simple bipartisan low-cost idea that will  make a real difference right now. It also fits  within  the parameters, as outlined by  the  President on Friday, of what could be included  in an economic stimulus package.  Madam Speaker, I respectfully urge the inclusion of accelerating the phase-in of the domestic manufacturing  tax deduction  in any  economic stimulus legislation that will be voted  on by the House this year.

76,Senate,110,0.409,34,2008-01-31,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, I want  to take this opportunity to say a few  words about my friend and colleague,  Senator Lott.  Senator Lott has compiled a long and  distinguished career in public service  on behalf of the people of Mississippi  and our Nation. He has been a tireless  advocate on behalf of the needs of his  State and its people, particularly in  light of the devastation wrought by  Hurricane Katrina. Senator Lott also  fought for our men and women in military uniform to ensure they have the  best  training,  equipment, and  technology available. Throughout his career, he believed that the American  people should be able to keep more of  their own money instead of sending it  to Washington. Finally, Senator Lott  understood and appreciated the fact we  need judges on the Federal bench who  will uphold the law, not make the law.  During his time in the Congress, he  has been an active participant in many  important  legislative  battles.  The  votes he has cast and the policies he  supported have made the State of Mississippi and our Nation a better place.  Senator Lott is in a select group of  individuals who have held leadership  positions  in both the House of Representatives and Senate. He has served  as House minority whip, Senate majority leader, Senate minority leader and  Senate minority whip. His election to  these important leadership positions in  both bodies show a high level of trust  and respect from his colleagues.  With his departure the Senate will  lose one of its most effective Senators  and the people of Mississippi will lose a  powerful advocate. I truly appreciate  his leadership, service in the Senate,  and service in the House of Representatives, wit, wisdom, and friendship.  I wish him the best of luck in all future endeavors.  f  TRIBUTE TO MARTY PAONE  ",2008
77,Senate,110,-0.314,34,2008-01-31,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to offer a few words of appreciation and to say ‘‘Farewell’’ to one of  the Senate’s  finest public  servants,  Marty Paone.  For our visitors in the gallery, and  for our viewers on C–SPAN,  it may  look  like Senators are running this  place. Mr. President, we know better.  We trust dedicated, professional staff  like Marty Paone to make sure things  get done.  As all of my colleagues know, Marty  is the secretary for the majority, and  when we were fewer Democrats around  here, he was our secretary for the minority. He has held this position for  the past  13 years. Before  that, he  served  as  the  assistant  secretary,  worked as floor staff and in the cloakroom, going back nearly three decades.  In short, Marty has spent close to his  entire adult life here on the Senate  floor, getting Senators where they need  to be, when they are supposed to be  there.  To do his job, Marty has to be a combination of traffic cop, diplomat, and  parliamentarian—and he has to have  the trust of the Senators who follow  his direction. Marty has that trust, because he has earned that trust, and because he has all those other skills, too.  I have been here 35 years; it is hard  for me to remember a time when Marty  wasn’t here. And I don’t just mean year  in and year out. I mean any hour of the  day and night. Whenever this place is  open for business, Marty has been here,  helping to maintain order and to get  things done. We are  indebted to his  many personal sacrifices, when he was  here instead of home with his family.  Indeed, it has been hard to get much  done around here without relying on  Marty’s expertise on Senate process. I  don’t know how he has managed to juggle all the demands on him. He is the  ‘‘go to guy’’ for help on moving amendments, overcoming objections, getting  a place in line for debate, complying  with Senate rules, strategizing passing  or defeating a measure. If you want to  know what is happening ‘‘behind the  scenes,’’ Marty is the person to look to.  There isn’t a vote that happens, there  isn’t a negotiation that takes place,  there isn’t a unanimous consent agreement—which is what makes this place  function—that Marty hasn’t helped to  piece together or made sure it’s done  correctly.  And Marty works  for each of us.  While, technically, he works  for the  Democrats, I know that many of my  Republican colleagues have turned to  Marty for guidance. He is known for always being candid and straightforward.  He has served us all with his honest  counsel—you could always count on  him  for a straight answer. And, remarkably, he has never lost patience  with any of us—no matter what we ask  or how often we call.  It is hard to describe to those who  haven’t spent much time in the Senate  how very important Marty Paone has  been to the Senate, day-to-day life and  historic moments. Mr. President, this  is the end of an era. We all hope it will  be  the beginning of a new one  for  Marty, away from the heavy responsibilities he has met so well for so long.  We wish him well. He will be missed  very much.  f  ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2007—  SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS  ",2008

I recently met  with principal Jan Hill and teachers  Jennifer Rodopoulos and Gina Thomase  from Forest Avenue, and I thoroughly  enjoyed the opportunity to talk with  them about education and this great  achievement.

This is a remarkable accomplishment,  and I applaud the hard work principal  Jan Hill and the many other hard-  working faculty and staff have done to  receive this high honor.

Mr. Dennison is being recognized  by the California Board of Forestry and Fire  Protection and will be the recipient of its highest honor, the Francis H. Raymond Award for  his 30 years of service and commitment to the  California forest industry.  After being  raised  in  rural Northern California, Mr. Dennison earned a bachelor of  science degree in forestry from the University  of California, Berkeley in 1959. Bill’s passion  for the forest began while working for the Diamond Match Lumber Company in Stirling City,  and within a  few short years, he became a  registered professional forester.  Mr. Dennison’s knowledge and leadership in  the forest industry set him apart from others  and quickly qualified him to take the reins as  the vice president and later president of the  California Forestry Association (CFA). During  his 14 year tenure, Bill represented the industry both in Sacramento and Washington, DC,  and was able to navigate CFA through some  of the most difficult forest management issues  it ever faced.  Throughout his career, Mr. Dennison has  distinguished himself as a visionary  leader  with the ability to educate the public on the  value  that California  forest products provide.  Bill was a critical member of the Quincy Library Group, helped organize  the National  Forest Counties and Schools Coalition and  later served as the executive director of the  Sierra Cascade Logging Conference.  Although Mr. Dennison’s accomplishments  in the forest industry are legendary, his greatest legacy may be his commitment to advancing forestry education programs and creating a  network  of  forest  community  organizations  known as  the Alliance  for Environment and  Resources that are today the model throughout the country.  Most recently, Mr. Dennison served as the  Third District supervisor  for Plumas County.  He quickly became a national  leader on resource conservation, water quality and rural  management issues while serving as chairman  of  the Public Lands Steering Committee  for  the National Association of Counties.  Bill has served on numerous boards and  commissions and has  received dozens of  community and national awards including: the  Plaque of Commendation by the National Forest Products Association; Award of Appreciation for Services by the National Forest Counties and Schools Coalition; and my  favorite,  selected twice with his wife Pat, as the Grand  Marshall for the Chester Rotary Club Fourth of  July Parade.  It is with deep respect and personal gratitude that I thank Bill Dennison for his service  to  the  forest  industry and  to  the citizens of  Northern California.  CHI MUI POST OFFICE BUILDING  HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 21, 2008  ",2008
82,,110,-0.348,4,2008-02-21,Mr. SCHIFF.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor a well-respected and dedicated leader in the 29th Congressional District and a role  model in the Asian community, Chi Mui, mayor  of the city of San Gabriel. It is with great pride  that I introduce a resolution today to pay tribute  to Chi Mui, with what may be  the  first  honor of its kind for a Chinese-American, by  naming the San Gabriel, California Post Office  for him.  Born in Toisan, China, on October 26, 1952,  Chi Mui was a man of humble origins whose  early experiences enabled him to relate and  connect to the Asian community in California.  His parents, a seamstress and a cook, left for  the United States in 1963 when Chi Mui was  10 and moved to New York City’s Chinatown.  It was in New York City that Mui learned to  speak English and graduated cum laude with  a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from  Polytechnic University of New York in 1980.  After moving to Southern California in 1980,  Chi Mui began working to better the lives of  immigrants in the region. Chi Mui’s immigrant  roots and experiences gave him special  insight, wisdom and the ability to connect with  the experiences of generations of people who  have come to this country and to San Gabriel  for a better life. Mayor Mui always recognized,  and never failed to pay tribute to, his parents  for their sacrifices and encouragement of their  children’s education and aspirations for the future.  Mui was a key player in the development of  600 units of affordable and senior housing for  Chinatown and taught citizenship to help hundreds of legal residents become United States  citizens. He led the effort to save the 50-acre  ‘‘Cornfield’’ in downtown Los Angeles as open  space, was  instrumental  in organizing  the  Chinatown Yard Alliance, and successfully obtained $35 million from the state in 2001 to  build the first urban state park and community  facilities on the Cornfield.  An avid  runner and athlete, Chi Mui co-  founded the Los Angeles Chinatown Athletic  Association Volleyball Club where he coached  young people in teamwork and sportsmanship.  He  also worked  to  expand  existing  recreational  facilities  in  the Chinatown community. In recognition of his leadership, he was  elected president of the Los Angeles Chinese  American Citizens Alliance—twice. The Alliance was  founded  in 1895  to advocate  for  equal political, economical and educational opportunities for Chinese-Americans.  Active in local politics early on, he was a  field representative for Rep. LUCILLEROYBAL-  ALLARD (D–Los Angeles) when she was in the  Assembly, and he worked for former Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D–Los Angeles) and  State Sen. Gloria Romero (D–Los Angeles). In  March 2003 he made history as the first Asian  and Chinese-American  to be elected  to  the  San Gabriel City Council since its incorporation in 1913.  In a city where one in every two residents  is Asian, Mayor Mui often played an important  role as a liaison between the city government  and the Asian community and he worked diligently to improve the lives of all residents.

83,House,110,-0.439,9,2008-03-04,Ms. CASTOR.," Mr. Speaker, ‘‘Here are no  lofty peaks seeking the sky, no mighty glaciers  or rushing streams wearing away the uplifted  land. Here is land, tranquil in its quiet beauty,  serving not as the source of water, but as the  receiver of  it. To  its natural abundance we  owe the spectacular plant and animal life that  distinguishes this place from all others in our  country.’’  These were the words of Harry Truman, 60  years ago at the dedication of the Everglades  National Park. And it is in the same spirit that  I support H. Res. 845, recognizing  the 60th  anniversary of Everglades National Park. The  Everglades are a completely unique treasure  for Floridians, and all Americans. So it is fitting  that they should also be unique in the national  park system. The Everglades were  the  first  unit of the park system to be designated not  for their scenic beauty alone, but for the extraordinary diversity of their wildlife.  One of the largest bodies of fresh water in  the United States, Lake Okeechobee, sits at  the top of the Everglades. During the wet season, Okeechobee slowly pours water over its  southern edge, and it flows out in a slow flood  that slides south and spreads out over hundreds of square miles. The water flows south,  but very slowly, sometimes as little as a hundred feet in a day. And it is remarkably shallow, as little as a foot in depth, which allows  the incredible diversity of plant and animal life,  unrivaled in the Nation.  In 1947, when Marjory Stoneman Douglas  published  ‘‘Everglades: River of Grass’’ and  Harry Truman dedicated  the Everglades as  part of the parks system, it was with the intention of preserving  the Everglades  for  future  generations. Douglas continued to fight for the  Everglades for the rest of her life, and she led  an ever growing chorus of voices, advocating  for our environment. The Everglades became  a touchstone for an entire movement of Floridians and other Americans who continue  to  fight to save our natural places, not only for  future generations, but also for their own sake.  Unfortunately,  the Everglades  still  faces  threats of the attrition of development, and the  redirection of  its waters.  In  the Water Resources Development Plan of 2000, Congress  included a comprehensive restoration plan to  bring the Everglades back to its natural state.  The Everglades  remain one of  the Nation’s  greatest natural treasures, and I am proud to  stand in recognition today of their 60th anniversary as part of the park system.  ",2008

87,House,110,0.435,23,2008-03-04,Mr. BUYER.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank some of my colleagues for their  vision back in 2003. They recognized  that Congress does a good job talking  about Medicare and the concerns about  the future, but they realize that very  few are very committed to addressing  Medicare’s challenges.  We, as a Congress, came together and  worked with President Clinton in the  1990s when we did the Balanced Budget  Act; and at that time, we even realized  that Medicare was growing, the growing senior population was going to be a  tremendous challenge to us; and in 2003  a small group of Members of Congress,  they put in trigger legislation, and now  this trigger, as the chairman said, goes  into effect  if the Medicare board of  trustees certifies  in two consecutive  years  that  45  percent  of Medicare  spending will come from general revenues in any of the upcoming 6 years.  Last year, the trustees certified this  Medicare spending level; and again this  year,  they have  certified  that  the  spending  is exorbitant and that the  trigger has now been hit.  As directed by law, the President had  no choice. He sent legislation to Congress to address this spending. We in  Congress have a responsibility to the  American people to act on the President’s  proposal. Unfortunately,  last  year my Democrat colleagues tried to  remove this trigger so that they can  continue  to  put  off  addressing  the  unsustainable cost of our Medicare program. Under their CHAMP legislation,  they slipped in a provision that would  have removed this trigger. In effect, it  would have allowed Congress to continue  to  ignore Medicare’s  growing  cost.  Even worse, the Democrats decided  to ignore Medicare’s growing costs; and  when  they do  that,  frankly  it  just  shoves these challenges off into the future and onto the backs of our children, and that is something we should  not be doing.  Last week, the majority leader and  the minority leader introduced a bill to  move forward with the President’s proposal  to bring Medicare costs back  under the trigger level. That is the responsible thing to do.  This Congress now should act on this  legislation. According to the Centers  for Medicare  and Medicaid Service  Health  Care  Spending,  the United  States will hit $4.3 trillion by year 2017,  nearly double that of 2007, equating to  nearly 20 percent of our gross domestic  product. In 2007, health care spending  accounted for 16.3 percent of our gross  domestic product. But more of that  cost is expected to shift to government  agencies even as the Federal Government struggles to shrink our own deficits.  Medicare spending alone is expected  to grow to $844 billion in year 2017.  That’s up from the $427 billion we spent  just last year in 2007. So Congress must  stop talking about Medicare and its potential insolvency, and we must take  action.  Medicare is the single largest purchaser of health care  in the United  States; and within the next 11 years,  the Medicare trust fund could potentially go bankrupt. Our Nation is at  risk to lose this important health care  program for seniors if we do not reform  this program. Future generations will  not have access, and that would be unfortunate.  This trigger has forced Congress to  be honest with the American people  about Medicare’s dim future. The future of our Medicare program, as I said,  is at risk. I ask my colleagues to join  with me to change this trend and protect Medicare for future generations,  and we can only do that by working together.  ",2008
88,House,110,0.528,23,2008-03-04,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to recapitulate why we are here  this evening taking this Special Order.  As I pointed out earlier, Medicare is a  mandatory program for senior citizens  over age 65. It was established in 1965,  which is 43 years ago. I don’t exactly  remember in the first year how many  citizens were covered and how much  money was expended, but my recollection is that several million senior citizens were covered and expenses were in  the order of a magnitude of 6 or $700  million. In the last year that we have  numbers for, 45 million Americans were  covered and the costs were over 400 billion.  Now, it is a good thing that we have  45 million senior citizens in this country. Those are our grandparents and  great grandparents and great aunts and  uncles. They are certainly the generation that has been pointed out that  fought the great wars of World War II  and Korea and Vietnam. They have  ushered in an amazing American economy unsurpassed in the history of the  world in terms of its ability to generate wealth and economic prosperity.  And they are well deserving of the benefits that we are paying out for Medicare.  So the problem is not that our senior  citizens don’t deserve the best health  care in the world, and it is not that we  are  living healthier and  longer. The  problem is, quite simply, how do we  pay  for  it. Average expenditures  for  Medicare are on the order of magnitude  of about $7,000 per person per year. And  to put that in perspective, that is more  than most families pay per person for  their food or for their housing.  If nothing  is done on the current  Medicare program in terms of its policies and the way it’s structured in 11  years, in 2019, the Medicare trust fund  is going to be bankrupt. As I pointed  out earlier, if you are 54 years young or  younger, when you retire, there will be  no Medicare. Now I’m 58. So if I were to  retire at age 65, in 7 years I would have  3 years of Medicare benefits before the  program went  bankrupt. My wife,  Terry, who’s younger than me, when  she retires, she would have no benefits.  None of my children would have benefits. None of my grandchildren would  have benefits.  So this is not a program that we can  just let go on automatic pilot. We need  to begin to fundamentally and in a focused way look at the Medicare program as it exists today, not cut people  off the program, not change it so that  there are fewer benefits. We need to  look at Medicare and try to bring our  technology to bear, bring our management processes to bear, all of the innovations that have happened in the last  40 years.  As I pointed out earlier, if we were  still making the 1964 Mustang, that  was a great car in 1964, 1965. But it’s  hardly the car that people want to buy  today. We didn’t have cell phones in  1965. Today, everybody in America has  a cell phone. In fact, there are more  cell phones than there are hard line  phones. If you look at computers, the  computer in 1965 was a mainframe computer that you had to go to a central  location to use. I would guess that almost every American citizen has some  access to a personal computer today.  So a lot has changed in many fields  since 1965. But in Medicare, we have  the  same basic program  funded  the  same basic way.  b2000  So we need to look at ways to change  that program and to bring it into the  21st century. I think some of those  ideas are going to be in the form of preventive medicine, like we have in those  seniors, about 20 percent of those 9 million that have chosen a Medicare Advantage plan. There may be some ways  in terms of sharing costs; as the President has  suggested, Medicare beneficiaries that are more well-to-do could  pay a higher share of their premium.  We have the whole issue of health information  technology, or health  IT.  It’s suspected and predicted that if we  would bring health information technology to bear on Medicare, you could  save tens of billions, perhaps more,  each year  just by using  that  technology that’s currently in the private  sector.  So, there are a number of great ideas,  but because of this Medicare trigger,  this year, a certain percent of Members, I believe it is 70 Members, but a  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:09 Mar 05, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K04MR7.055 H04MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2008
89,Senate,110,-0.245,44,2008-03-04,Ms. KLOBUCHAR.," Mr. President, I  am proud to be a member of the Commerce Committee that passed this legislation through the committee under  the  leadership of Chairman  Senator STEVENS, and the Consumer  Subcommittee Chairman PRYOR. I am  also glad this legislation includes the  bill  I  introduced that  finally put a  mandatory ban on lead in children’s  toys.  This legislation has been called by  the Wall Street Journal as ‘‘the most  significant consumer-safety legislation  in a generation.’’ That comes from the  Wall Street Journal. But what this is  about is not all the details of all the  toys, which I am going to talk about in  a minute, and the 29 million toys that  have been recalled and what this has  meant to our economy, but what this is  about are these little children.  Senator PRYOR and  I  just  left an  event where two children, their families, their mothers, were there to talk  about what had happened to them. The  first was this little boy named Jacob.  His family is from Arkansas. The mom  painted this picture for us. Look at  this little boy. She painted this picture  that I will never forget, of her standing  in the kitchen one day and all of a sudden they see their little boy and he is  practically  limp. Just  like  that he  went  from being a happy  little boy  playing.  What happened is he had swallowed  one of these Aqua Dots toys, one of  these toys you put in water and it expands to an animal or whatever it is.  He had swallowed it. So he is getting  more and more limp, and finally the  ambulance comes and they end up in  the hospital. Within an hour, he  is  completely unconscious. They have no  idea what is wrong. Unconscious. They  thought maybe he had swallowed a little  toy, maybe  something  that you  would think would be in his stomach  creating  some  indigestion or  something such as that, but the hospital  tries everything  they can  think of.  They thought maybe he had accidentally gotten into their medicine cabinet and they didn’t know it and took  some medicine  and  something happened. So they gave him drugs to try  to reverse it, but he wouldn’t wake up.  It was a complete puzzle because they  didn’t know how this could have happened. Nothing they tried worked.  Finally, 6 hours later—and the doctor  said  if  he  hadn’t  been  there,  he  wouldn’t have  believed  it—with  all  these  tubes connected and everyone  thinking they are going to lose him, he  wakes up and he  is  fine. And they  think: How could this happen? What is  wrong? And they simply don’t know.  So they call the company that manufactures these Aqua Dots and they try  to write them. The mom gets home the  next day and gets on the Internet with  bloggers  trying  to  figure out what  could be wrong. She writes letters to  the company, trying to get information.  Well, finally, they tested him some  more and they tested these Aqua Dots  some more. And what did they find?  They found that the Aqua Dots contained a chemical that was really the  date rape drug.  The date rape drug, as a prosecutor, I  can tell you that we handled those  cases where women have been slipped  one of those drugs in their drink; they  are suddenly completely out of it and  do not know what happens. You know  the crimes that have occurred as a result there.  But here is this little boy swallowing  a dot, a dot that had the date rape drug  in it manufactured in China. And that  mother stood here with Senator PRYOR  and me and told this moving story and  said: This cannot happen to other parents.  She said: The Senators in this body,  why do they not think if this happened  to their kid or their grandkid where  they suddenly swallow a little toy and  are out like that. It is like swallowing  a gumball, out like that for 6 hours  thinking they are going to die.  Then there was another mother who  came from Oregon. She told the story  of her son, whom we see now years  later, Colton. When he was very little,  he swallowed a charm they had gotten  from some one of those little vending  machines that you put your money  into.  He swallowed it. And all of a sudden  she said he started acting completely  lethargic, not at all like the little toddler he was. And they brought him into  the hospital and they found out that  charm was 39 percent lead, 39 percent  lead.  Now, their story, unlike the story of  little Jacob, did not end there, because  he has that lead permanently in his  system. And today, years and years  later when they go to the doctor, he is  still tested  for elevated  lead  levels.  And, in fact, even a few days after he  got home, after they had gotten the  charm out of his stomach, he bit his  cheek and his cheek swelled up to the  size of a golf ball because of the lead  that was in his system.  That is what we are talking about—  moms getting little charms that their  kids swallow, which used to be maybe  if you swallowed a penny, having this  kind of health effect.  We all know what lead can mean. I  certainly know in Minnesota where we  had a little boy whose mom was not  with us today. The mom was not there  because her heart is broken. Her little  4-year-old boy died when he swallowed  a charm that turned out to be 99 percent  lead. And he did not die  from  choking, he did not die because  it  blocked his airway, he died because  that lead seeped into his system day  after day. And when he died, he was  tested at three times the normal lead  level.  In 2007, nearly 29 million toys and  pieces of children’s  jewelry were recalled because they were found to be  dangerous and, in some cases, deadly  for children. As a mom and a former  prosecutor and now as a Senator, I find  it totally unacceptable that these toxic  toys are  in our  stores and on our  shores. As my 12-year-old daughter said  when she found out that the Barbies  were being recalled, she said: This is  getting serious.  The provision of the Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act  that I authored addresses some of the  most serious discoveries of this past  year. And that is the lead that has been  surfacing in these toys. The toy that  little Jarnell Brown swallowed that led  to his death was made in China. It was  99 percent lead.  The toy that little Colton swallowed  that nearly led to his death and has led  to elevated lead levels in his bloodstream for many years was 39 percent  lead.  These  deaths,  these  injuries have  been made so much more tragic by the  fact that they could have been prevented. These little boys should never  have been given these toys in the first  place.  It  should not  take a child’s  death or severe injury or a child swallowing an Aqua Dot with a date rape  drug to alert us that there is a problem  in this country.  Parents should have the right to expect that these toys are tested and that  these problems are found before these  toys get to the toy box. For 30 years,  we have been aware of the dangers  poised by lead. We all know about it  from the lead paint standard.  But what is ironic to me is we have a  Federal standard  for  lead paint, we  have a standard, but we have never had  a standard for lead in toys or jewelry;  never had a standard for those little  pieces of jewelry that will end up in  kids’ stomachs, or how about teenage  girls who are sitting in class and chewing on a charm that they may have  around their neck—never had a standard; it has all been voluntary.

Since 1933,  the Eastern Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce has  tirelessly promoted its members and the economic health of our community. I am honored  to represent this organization in Congress.  In 1933, the Jenkintown Businessmen’s Association was incorporated with just 44 members. Since  that  time,  the  chamber  has  changed its name a number of times to mark  its growth within the business community. In  1961, the organization became the Jenkintown  Chamber of Commerce. By 1968, the organization  became  known  as  the  Greater  Jenkintown Chamber of Commerce to reflect  the expansion of its service area. In 1992, the  chamber became  the Eastern Montgomery  County Chamber of Commerce.  While successfully  fulfilling  its mission  to  support and promote  local businesses of all  sizes, the chamber has also successfully established strong community ties. The chamber  has partnered with area businesses  to host  the annual Best of  the Burbs celebration of  business cultural and community events, featuring  the chamber’s annual Business Expo,  which showcases over 100 area businesses.  In 2003, the chamber established Leadership  Montgomery County, an  innovative program  dedicated  to strengthening  the personal and  professional skills of our community’s  future  leaders.  The chamber’s active board of directors and  committed staff implement outreach, advocacy  and  fundraising activities  to strengthen  the  chamber’s enduring presence in the community. Over  the past 75 years,  the Eastern  Montgomery  Chamber  of  Commerce  has  served as a powerful catalyst, uniting businesses, community agencies, government officials, and educational institutions to make our  community a great place to live and work.  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues  join me in celebrating the Eastern Montgomery  County Chamber of Commerce’s 75th anniversary milestone and wishing the chamber and  its members many more years of community  enrichment and service.  f  TRIBUTE TO MONSIGNOR WILLIAM  J.

Monsignor Linder has served in the Catholic  priesthood for more than 44 years, spending  the entire  length of his ministry  in Newark,  New Jersey. For  the past 31 years he has  been the pastor of St. Rose of Lima parish, a  multi-ethnic and multi-racial congregation with  representation  from 42 nations around  the  world.  The New Community Corporation celebrates  its 40th anniversary  this year.  Its history  is  filled with stories of service to the city of Newark. The New Community Corporation is the  most comprehensive and  largest community  development organization in the United States,  employing over 1600 individuals and providing  urban dwellers with housing, day care, alternative education, social services, job training,  employment services and health care.  Monsignor Linder has received many honors  and awards including the HUD Distinguished  Service Award, The National Association of  Home Builders Housing Hall of Fame award,  the Aetna Foundation Voice of Conscience  Award,  the MacArthur Foundation Fellows  Award and the Governor’s Gold Medal (NJ).  He was also selected by President Clinton to  attend the president’s first inauguration as one  of the 60 ‘‘Faces of Hope’’ and by President  Bush to participate in a conference on faith-  based initiatives.  Madam Speaker, I know my colleagues will  join me in honoring a wonderful servant to humanity. I am pleased to recognize his tremendous contributions to the city of Newark and  wish him the best in all his future endeavors.  f  IN TRIBUTE TO LOUVENIA  JOHNSON  HON.

Mr. Chairman, we have heard and we  know this budget has the largest tax  increase  in American history and  it  also doubles the deficit from what the  last Republican budget was. But somehow the majority seems to want to  convince us all that this is good for  America.  Well,  in considering  that,  I’m  reminded of this commercial I see on TV,  this guy named Matthew Lesko. Have  you seen it? He wears this funny suit  with these symbols on it, and they film  it right out here on the west side of the  Capitol. And he clearly makes a great  living. He publishes books to tell people how to get their hands on government money. He says in the commercial:  ‘‘Let Matthew Lesko be your  guide to join the millions each year  who get  free money, grants,  loans,  giant contracts, and  free assistance  from the Federal Government.’’  Here are some of his book titles:  ‘‘Free Money  for Business’’;  ‘‘Free  Money  for  a Better Home’’;  ‘‘Free  Money to Pay Your Bills’’; and, my  personal favorite, ‘‘Free Money to Quit  Your Job.’’  Now, the Democrats would have you  believe that they’re perpetuating with  this budget the concept put forward in  this  commercial,  that  government  money is free. But you know what? It’s  not. Because every dollar that the government sends out in free money to  somebody is a dollar they took, this  government took, from some American  who earned it or that this government  borrowed from some American who has  yet to earn it but will have to pay it  back, plus interest, in the future.  The majority in this budget has refused to set priorities and, instead, is  just spending everybody’s money on everything  and  demanding more  and  more of that money that they would  like to think of as free. But we all  know every single dollar will eventually come from us.  b1615  ",2008

107,House,110,-0.201,36,2008-03-12,Mr. ROSS.," Madam Chairman, earlier  today my Blue Dog colleagues and I  stood together to offer our official endorsement of Chairman SPRATT’s budget because it is clear that we share the  common goal of eliminating wasteful  government  spending,  adhering  to  strict PAYGO principles, and  finally  addressing the  long-term  fiscal challenges facing this country. Not only  does this budget resolution begin to address our long-term fiscal challenges,  it also includes measures that crack  down on wasteful government spending  so that no tax dollar is wasted.  This budget continues to take steps  to reverse the reckless fiscal policies of  the past 7 years of Republican rule by  incorporating strict PAYGO rules. It  does this in two ways: First, it provides  for fiscally responsible tax relief for 23  million middle-income Americans by  including a fully offset fix to the alternative minimum tax; second, Chairman  SPRATT’s budget resolution includes a  commitment to the extension of the  same statutory PAYGO requirements  which proved instrumental in turning  the  large deficits of the early 1990s  under a Republican into record-budget  surpluses under a Democrat  for the  first time in over 40 years.  The Blue Dogs are committed to addressing the serious  long-term  fiscal  challenges  facing the United States,  and we  should confront  these challenges earlier rather than later so that  we do not pass the burden of unmanageable debt on to our children and  grandchildren.  This administration, this Republican  administration,  has  borrowed more  money from foreigners in the past 7  years than the previous 42 Presidents  combined. It is time to restore common  sense and fiscal discipline and accountability to our government. That’s what  this budget resolution does, and I’m  pleased to stand and speak in support  of it.  ",2008
108,House,110,-0.163,36,2008-03-12,Mr. MAHONEY of Florida.," Madam  Chairman, I rise today to enter into  this colloquy with Mr. BOYDto express  my support for the House budget resolution for fiscal year 2009. A budget is  a reflection of our national priorities.  For far too long, the administration’s  priorities have been misplaced. In fact,  the budget submitted by the President  earlier this year makes cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and the environment.  In addition, it taxes our veterans by requiring them to pay new fees for health  care.  As a result of this administration’s  misplaced priorities, the $5.6 trillion  projected  10-year  surplus  that  they  have inherited has been squandered. As  a  result,  our  children  and  grandchildren are confronted with the challenge of paying back a $9.3 trillion  debt.  This budget before us today, however, is a good budget for Florida and  the Nation. The House budget protects  our homeland by rejecting the President’s cuts to first responder programs,  reinstates funding for the COPS program, and that will put 247 more police  on the street in Florida. This budget  helps Florida’s kids. It provides substantially more money for schools and  education than the President’s budget.  It will allow our schools to hire the  highly skilled teachers that over 25,000  Florida children need desperately to  help them grow up and compete in the  global economy. It rejects the President’s irresponsible new fees that he  wants to put on the backs of our veterans. It increases health care funding  to allow our Veterans Administration  to treat the 5.8 million more patients,  including 333,000 from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.  I support this budget because it is fiscally responsible, it balances the budget by 2012, and it adheres to all of the  PAYGO rules. Finally, I support this  budget because  it protects the most  vulnerable among us: our Nation’s seniors. Specifically, the budget resolution improves support of housing for  the elderly.  I would  like  to  thank Chairman  SPRATT for working with me to ensure  that the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program is adequately funded. I  urge my colleagues to support this bill.  ",2008
109,House,110,-0.161,36,2008-03-12,Mr. COOPER.," Madam Chairman, I’m  happy to support this budget. One of  the reasons is the extraordinary leadership of  the chairman of  the House  Budget Committee, JOHNSPRATT from  South Carolina. A true gentleman, a  man of wisdom, he has done the difficult work of pulling a very diverse  caucus together, and we appreciate his  listening to Blue Dog concerns.  We are proud of our role as Blue Dogs  as having pulled the Democratic Caucus towards the middle. That’s a good  thing and help make the Democratic  Party the party of fiscal responsibility  in America.  People who know me know that I am  not a very partisan person. I admire  greatly  the  ranking member, ",2008

111,House,110,0.518,50,2008-03-12,Mr. BRADY of Texas.," Mr. Chairman,  as a member of the Joint Economic  Committee on behalf of our  senior  ranking Republican, the Honorable JIM  I rise today to oppose the  Democrats’ irresponsible budget resolution that will only pave the way for  major tax increases and hurt the economy.  SAXTON,  You may recall that 15 months ago,  Democrats took over the control of the  House and the Senate vowing a new direction  for America,  and  in  truth,  we’ve experienced that. Since Democrats took control of both Chambers,  food prices are up, college tuition is up,  health care costs are up, fuel prices are  way up, unemployment is up, the deficit is up.  They vowed that they would do three  things: They would pay every dime of  this war, not mortgage the future. How  much  have  they  paid? Zero. They  vowed they would not raise the debt  limit. In fact, they called it immoral  when we did it. So they did it very  quietly without a vote in the first 60  days they were in control. And they  vowed that they would pay as you go,  that they would not allow any tax increases or relief to go forward without  paying for them, and, of course, they  failed at that as well.  And now we are at a time when the  economy is on the brink of a severe  downturn. The last thing we should be  doing is telling Americans to expect to  pay billions more in taxes in just 2  short years;  $683 billion worth,  the  largest single tax increase in American  history. That averages out to almost  $3,000 per  family every year. And  I  know $3,000 doesn’t sound like a lot in  Washington, DC, where we squander  billions, but for families back in Texas,  and I think most middle class families,  that is far too much to bear, especially  with prices being what they are.  I guess the question we always have,  those of us who believe we ought to  have lower taxes and less spending, is  why does the Democrat budget insist  that  families tighten their belt but  they don’t do anything to tighten the  belt up here in Washington?  Our public wants us to spend more  wisely, not more. And they believe tax  is too high. This budget is just the opposite.  b1945  I don’t know of any economist that  thinks tax increases are good for an  economy in an economic slowdown, and  the timing now is particularly bad. Our  economy has  suffered  some  serious  shocks: Skyrocketing oil prices, the  housing meltdown and mortgage crisis.  We certainly don’t need another one  from here in the Halls of Congress.  And I have to tell you, too, I enjoy  hearing about all  the class warfare  issues. So, we  just asked an  independent  source,  the  Congressional  Budget Office, are  the  rich getting  richer under President Bush? They say  the facts are just the opposite. Quoting  from them, the period between 2000 and  2005 has not been a time of surging income inequality. Instead, the income  gains of the top wealthy 1 percent actually slowed during this period.  In  contrast, between 1992 and 2000, President Clinton’s years, the average income of the top 1 percent skyrocketed  by 84 percent. So the king of inequality  is President Clinton. They just want to  try to hang it on President Bush.

113,House,110,-0.266,64,2008-03-12,Mr. POMEROY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in favor of  moving the Pension Technical Corrections Act of 2008 forward in an expedited manner. The bill is most needed  by employers who are committed to  providing their employees with a financially secure retirement through a defined benefit plan.  Why do we need this bill? Why do we  need to act this quickly? Let me just  break it down for you.  On August  17,  2006,  the President  signed into law the Pension Protection  Act. This bill imposed sweeping reform  affecting how employers fund their defined  benefits  plans maintained  for  their employees. In addition, the bill  imposed significant reforms for pension  plans offered to many union workers  who  participated  in multi-employer  plans.  However, many  provisions  in  the  PPA became effective on January 1 of  this year. The Treasury Department  and the Internal Revenue Service cannot implement many of these provisions because they need further clarification of congressional intent. This  bill provides the needed clarification  for the Treasury Department, Internal  Revenue  Service,  corporations  and  other businesses who sponsor retirement plans, as well as working families  who contribute to and benefit  from  401(k) plans or defined contribution  plans.  For the employers who have weathered the storm and are persistently  committed to providing a secured retirement for their workers, this bill is  for you. For the beneficiary of a 401(k)  plan who wants to keep money in a retirement plan savings vehicle to  finance  retirement  rather  than being  forced to spend it currently, this bill is  for you. This bill provides clarification  for the correct application of the non-  spousal rollover provision.  For the construction worker whose  plan may be experiencing underfunding  and could be subject to a benefit reduction, this bill will make it clear when  the plan must provide you with the notice alerting you of the plan’s funding  status. It would also clarify whether  you are subject to such a reduction in  pension benefits.  You see, Mr. Speaker, we are talking  about quality-of-life issues for working  families and about helping those employers who want to help their employees provide for a financially secure retirement.  I encourage my colleagues  in this  body and in the Senate to keep this bill  clean and move it quickly. I encourage  them to join me in doing what we were  sent here by our constituents to do,  provide  legislation  to help  improve  their lives. Let’s pass this bill and get  it to the President before the end of  the month, because people are waiting.  We  have  kept  them waiting  long  enough.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2008
114,House,110,-0.363,71,2008-03-12,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  it’s an honor to be before the House  once again. As you know, the 30-Something Working Group, we have been  coming to the floor now for some 5  years to not only share with the Members but also with the American people  on what’s happening here in the Capitol.  I’m going to do a short segment because we have other Members  that  need to come to the floor. And the hour  is late, and tomorrow we’re going to be  working pretty hard past this hour tomorrow, I’m pretty sure. And we want  to make sure that everyone is able to  make it home and do the things that  they need to do to prepare for that day.  Mr. Speaker, with that, I just would  like to say that we’ve been in debate  now for a couple of hours on the budget, the 2009 budget. And I can tell you,  Federal budget, as  it relates to the  House version, I can tell you what I’ve  read and seen of the President’s budget, we have a lot of patching up to do  in that budget.  Tomorrow we will have a number of  different caucuses coming to the floor  presenting their budget, their  ideas.  Some of them came before us today to  talk about some of those issues to be  considered before the full House, and  I’m glad that we are providing that opportunity for the Members to participate in that process; also, to be in debate with the Republicans on Democratic new ideas, moving in a new direction. And I think it’s so very, very  important not only for the Members of  the House to be a part of that exercise,  but also for the American people to  witness that exercise so that they will  know, firsthand, who has the best priorities for the working American people that are out there, and those that  are retired and those that are yet unborn, preparing this Nation to be able  to bring them up in a way and to be  able to have the resources in place so  that they can see the kind of strong  America that I witnessed when I came  about.  Now, let me just share a little bit  about this budget. And it supports fiscal  responsibility and also accountability on government. I think a lot of  the frustration with so many Americans right now is based upon a lack of  accountability, a lack of oversight, a  lack of restraint as it relates to spending. And I think when you have accountability,  you’re  going  to  save  money. I don’t think it, I know it.  Now, 13 years in public service, and 8  years at the State level, I think it’s  important that we embody that. And  this budget, it brings the budget back  to balance by 2010, and our House budget, unlike the President’s budget that  he has proposed, not only to the House,  but to the Senate, also the budget follows PAYGO rules which you say pay  as you go, something that we adopted  in our rules to say if we’re going to  spend it, we’re going to show how we’re  going to pay for it. And I’m glad to see  that we’re still embracing not only  that rule, but also that philosophy as it  relates to the American people, of what  they ask for.  The administration also continues in  the  fiscally  irresponsible  practices.  And in this budget we bring it back to  being responsible. And it’s a real contrast, because since January 2001, a $5.6  trillion, 10-year surplus has been converted into a record deficit. And as you  know, Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor  almost every night to share how that  deficit has crippled America and hasn’t  allowed us to be able to do the things  that we need to do back in our districts.  I  think we  look at  the wasteful  spending;  this administration  is  littered with examples of wasted spending  and  lack of accountability. And I’m  glad that Chairman SPRATT of South  Carolina has  embraced  that  in his  budget that he’s bringing to the floor.  Our budget that we’re bringing on the  Democratic side, we’re looking at not  only strengthening the economy, but  creating jobs and at the same time energy,  education,  jobs,  infrastructure  and innovation will be the watchwords  as we move through this process as  basic principles. And so many Americans can, and also the Members, can go  on www.budget.house.gov to  look at  the Democratic budget because I think  it’s important that we have that level  of transparency so that they can take a  look at the proposals that we are going  to put forward.  So many of my constituents and so  many Americans are challenged by the  cost of energy. And we do know on January 22 of 2001, gas prices were at $1.47.  And now, today it’s at $3.13 per gallon.  And I know many of my constituents  and many of the Americans that are  paying attention  to  the proceedings  here on the floor, they’re saying, well,  Congressman, you’re a little bit off of  that $3.13, because as I moved around  Washington, D.C. today I saw it as a lot  greater.  b2130  We provide, with our budget, as it relates to dealing with some of these gas  issues, it provides a $6.1 billion funding  for renewable energy and energy efficiency  and  other  energy  programs,  which is $1.1 billion, 21 percent more  than the 2008 level.  So we are moving in that direction  making  those kinds of  investments,  and some may translate that into saying that we are pulling ourselves out of  Iraq, out of the Middle East and investing in the Midwest and trying to not  only  push  private  sector  but  also  Americans  in the direction of being  more energy efficient so that we don’t  find ourselves continuing to depend on  the big oil companies.  If I can have my big oil company  chart, I would appreciate it, because I  think it’s important to be able to reflect on it. Also, it rejects President  Bush’s budget cuts of energy efficiency  and  renewable energy programs,  including the cuts to solar energy power,  and also what the President did in terminating the weatherization-assistance  program. We are replacing all of that,  and I think it’s important for Americans to understand what is happening  here.  These big oil companies have reaped  record profits under the Bush administration, and as you can see here in 2002,  it was first $30 billion in record-breaking profits. It then kicked over $59 billion, $82 billion, $109 billion, $118 billion  and $123.3 billion of these oil companies  raking  in these profits. And as you  know, Mr. Speaker, we have moved legislatively to make sure that we call  back some of those giveaways that the  Republican Congress gave  these oil  companies.  And  this has  resulted  in what  I  talked about a little earlier, $1.47 when  the Bush  administration  started  in  January 22, 2001, and it almost sounds  like an inauguration date, and what we  face now at $3.13. The barrel of oil continues to go up.  So this energy investment and being  efficient is very, very important to the  country, also very, very important to  national security.  We also invest in hundreds of billions  of dollars in new investment and green  jobs, green-collar jobs. These are jobs,  Mr. Speaker, that we can’t ship overseas. When we make  our  building  greener, when we make our homes  greener, these are  jobs that anyone  who can even be a high school dropout  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:50 Jun 26, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€8BA~2€8NE~2\H12MR8.REC H12MR 8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008

147,Senate,110,0.333,99,2008-03-12,Mr. MARTINEZ.," Mr. President, in a  recent column discussing the disaster  that  the Castro  regime has visited  upon  Cuba,  columnist George Will  wrote about another Cuban, Armando  Valladares, who withstood the regime’s  brutal prison system for 22 years. Of  the prison’s conditions, Will wrote:  Some doors are welded shut and prisoners  are fed watery soup sometimes laced with  glass, or dead rats, or half a cow’s intestine,  rectum included, containing feces.  This  is  the ugly  reality of what  speaking openly against the Castro regime gets you in Cuba. Today there are  hundreds of political prisoners in the  many prisons that have cropped up  since the Castro regime took power.  Dr. Biscet is one of those prisoners, a  noble and decent man choosing to fight  for a cause greater than his own, risking everything in the process.  Throughout U.S. history, Congress,  as an institution, has recognized those  who stand up for democracy, the rule  of law, and human rights. We owe Dr.  Biscet and those he inspires the honor  of knowing that we support his worthy  efforts and that Americans share his  desire for seeing freedom take root in a  country plagued by oppression for far  too long.  Awarding this honor to a man with  such  courage  and  conviction  will  strengthen his cause and the cause of  all Cubans and send a message to the  Cuban regime that they are on the  wrong side of history, and they are on  the wrong side of what is good and is  right.  I urge my colleagues to support this  man who seeks democratic change and  the recognition of human rights by bestowing this honor of a Congressional  Gold Medal to Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet.  Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of time on this busy day on the  floor. I know Senator MENENDEZwishes  to speak on this issue, but at this time  I yield the floor, and I thank the chairman for the time allowed.  ",2008
148,Senate,110,-0.362,99,2008-03-12,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. President,  I  rise with my colleague and friend, Senator MARTINEZ, in strong support of our  resolution to recommend Cuban dissident and political prisoner Dr. Oscar  MARTINEZ NELSON Elias Biscet for the Congressional Gold  Medal. This medal is the Nation’s highest and most distinguished  civilian  award, and I can think of few who are  more deserving than this man. For his  courageous commitment to democracy,  for his unwavering defense of human  rights, for his lifetime of working for  peaceful change on an  island where  freedom dares not speak its name, Dr.  Biscet has earned the admiration of his  community, and he has earned the recognition of this Congress.  Just over 4 months ago, both Senator  and I, along with Senators  and SALAZAR, stood on this  floor and declared our solidarity with  about 70 Cuban youths who had just  been thrown in jail. Their crime was  nothing more than wearing this simple  white bracelet  that  says one word,  ‘‘cambio,’’ change.  This one simple gesture was strong  enough to have them held as prisoners.  This one simple gesture was strong  enough to have them detained and harassed. But as I said on the  floor 4  months ago, I also hoped this one gesture would be strong enough to inspire  us and to inspire those who love freedom and democracy and have respect  for human rights around the globe.  Today we stand here once again, in  solidarity, to recognize someone who  has  shown  courage  over  and  over  again—courage  in defense of human  rights and democracy courage to speak  out about the future he wants to see on  the island of Cuba.  When I  last came to the  floor to  speak of Dr. Biscet, it was 1 week before he received the Presidential Medal  Freedom, the highest civilian award  bestowed by the President. Unfortunately,  he  received  the  award  in  absentia. He received it this way because has been languishing in the jails  of the Castro regime, serving a 25-year  prison sentence.  And he continues to languish there  today. His  crime? Seeking peaceful  change  in his  country. His  crime?  Hanging a  flag sideways. His crime?  Fighting against a repressive regime.  By awarding the Congressional Gold  Medal to Dr. Biscet, we would create a  physical  representation of  so many  years of political bravery.  In that medal, we will see a shining  image of his courage and accomplishments.  In that medal, we will see the patient  suffering of Dr. Biscet’s wife, the fellow  democracy  advocate,  Elsa Morjeon  Hernandez, and the patient suffering of  his two children who have had to grow  up with their father in jail.  In that medal, we will see the 3 years  Dr. Biscet spent  in prison, 3 years,  after hanging the national flag sideways at a press conference.  In that medal, we will see that once  he was released, Dr. Biscet organized  engaged organizing  seminars on  the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and continued to fight every day to  bring democracy and justice to Cuba.  And in that medal, we will see a solid  beacon of hope for the people of that island, recognition that people inspired  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:46 Mar 13, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G12MR6.017 S12MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 1 6 C P D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2008
149,Senate,110,-0.166,113,2008-03-12,Mrs. LINCOLN.,"  I would also note  that we had 25 Senators who joined us  in a letter to the Budget Committee recently requesting this as a priority in  the budget, and I would encourage my  colleagues  to  take  a  look  at  this  amendment and join us because it is  truly  the  right  thing  to  do. This  amendment would  provide  an  additional $50 million for the Veterans Benefits Administration.  In the scheme of things, and how we  talk about things in Washington, $50  million is not a great deal. It is not a  huge amount in the overall scheme of  the dollars we talk about in our Nation’s budget. But we believe it can  truly make a difference in providing  the Veterans Benefits Administration  with the additional resources it desperately  needs  to more  effectively  meet its increasing workload and its  unacceptability in terms of the large  backlog of pending claims.  In recent years, Congress has taken  the lead in tackling the claims backlog  and improving the management of the  VBA. In last year’s budget, much needed resources were provided to increase  the number of claims processing staff  essential  to  reducing  the  pending  claims  backlog  and  improving  the  timeliness of that claims process.  There is not a Member in this body,  I am sure, who has not dealt with, in  their constituent  services and  their  casework, the issues of veterans’ benefits that have been backlogged, the  time it takes to get these veterans the  benefits  they  deserve.  They  have  fought hard for this country and need  and deserve those benefits.  The leadership and guidance of Chairman AKAKAand Chairman CONRADand  their staffs certainly made all of this  possible. Today we seek to invest further  in the commitment we already  made in last year’s budget and what we  were pushing forward and were successful in, in terms of additional funding  for the VBA dealing with that backlog  of cases.  According to the Veterans Benefits  Administration’s  Workload  Report  from March 8, 2008, the total number of  pending  compensation  and  pension  claims was 666,710. That was up from  627,429 this time last year. So we are  seeing an  increase  in our  caseload  while all the while we still have a  backlog in those cases that are pending.  The amount that has been pending  for more than 180 days is nearly 27 percent. Additionally, claims requiring a  disability rating determination, which  are the most time consuming and resource intensive to the process, have  increased more than 50 percent since  2003.  This is inexcusable—veterans who return home from Iraq and Afghanistan,  veterans who are out there with disability  claims  from  other  circumstances, who have been put into  these backlogs.  It  is  continuing  to  grow. We are only asking for $50 million to be able to improve upon that  situation for these veterans.  Between the fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year  2007,  the number of  filed  claims increased 45 percent, from almost 579,000 to 838,000. For fiscal year  2009, the VA, which has consistently  underestimated  its workload  in  the  past, projects the number to increase  to approximately 872,000. These numbers are increasing and we have to get  a handle on it so we can stop those  overloads and certainly the workloads  that are backlogged.  Further, the VA cautions that ongoing hostilities in Iraq and Afghanistan  could increase its workload even further. So we know unfortunately there  is not going to be a lessening. There is  only, more than likely, going to be an  increase. We have to make sure we  have the resources there.  In light of all these mounting challenges, this amendment would provide  an additional $50 million to the VBA’s  general administration account so it  would have the flexibility to explore  pilot programs and  invest more  in  training or technology  initiatives to  help tackle the claims backlog. This is  not a process that is going to go away  if we do not address it. It is simply not  fair to our veterans.  It  complements  the  recommendations that are provided in the Budget  Views and Estimates  from both the  House and Senate Committees on Veterans’ Affairs. As discussed  in those  documents——  (Disturbance  lery.)  ",2008

151,Senate,110,-0.383,127,2008-03-12,Mr. REED.," In conclusion, this budget  resolution and the amendment I have  offered provide a blueprint for legislative action. The amendment that will  be offered in its appropriate turn by  Senator CONRADwill address the critical  issue of helping  families make  ends meet by helping them with their  energy costs, both  in severe winters  and scalding summers.  However, we have to do much more  than this. We have to help people with  mortgage bills, the rising cost of food  and energy and stagnant wages. I hope  the administration and my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle will join  us in the coming months to enact legislation that will make a huge difference  for Americans in all phases of the economic  issues  that challenge  them—  paying the mortgage, feeding the family, heating their home, paying the  health care bills, getting jobs in the  United States  that pay wages with  which they can support their families.  We could do that. We have done it in  the past. There is no reason we cannot  work together to make it happen now.  I yield the floor.  ",2008
152,Senate,110,0.496,127,2008-03-12,Mr. CORNYN.," Madam President,  I  understand the concerns of the Senator. It will take 60 votes to waive the  point of order. Sixty-three Senators  voted for the amendment last year. My  hope would be they would vote with me  to waive the point of order. Unfortunately, the Senator is correct. After 63  Senators voted on a bipartisan basis  for this amendment last year, it was  stripped  in  the conference. Unfortunately, this is the kind of thing that  tends to undermine public confidence  in what we are doing, when we see a  strong bipartisan show of support for a  commonsense amendment and then, behind closed doors, it is later stripped  from the legislation. I respect and understand the concerns of the Senator. I  will move to waive the budget point of  order at the appropriate time.  I thank the Chair.  ",2008
153,Senate,110,0.409,148,2008-03-12,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak  to amendment No.  4268. This  amendment would provide for a total of  $200 million over the next 5 fiscal years  for tribal justice and law enforcement.  Specifically, this amendment would do  two  things  in a  fiscally  responsible  way. First, it would increase the BIA’s  public  safety  and  justice  account,  which  funds tribal  law enforcement,  tribal court systems, and tribal detention centers by $25 million a year for  the next 5 years. Second, it would increase  funding  for U.S. attorneys to  prosecute crimes in Indian Country by  $15 million a year for the next 5 years.  The need for this amendment on our  Nation’s reservations cannot be overstated, as the absence of basic levels of  public safety is reaching a crisis point.  The statistics are startling. Nationally, studies show that one of every  three Native American women will be  raped in their lifetime. Crime rates on  remote reservations are an average of  10 times higher than the rest of the Nation. The Department of Justice has  found that American Indian women are  21⁄2 times more likely to be raped or  sexually  assaulted  than  women  throughout the rest of the country.  In my home State of South Dakota,  homicide rates within reservations are  almost  10  times higher  than  those  found in the rest of South Dakota. According  to  the BIA, Standing Rock  Sioux Tribe has the second highest rate  of crime of all the reservations in the  Nation.  In order to start to help improve public safety on our Nation’s reservations,  there needs to be a two-part solution.  First, we have to ensure there are adequate  law enforcement personnel on  the reservations to respond to, to investigate, and to deter crime—something that is not currently happening.  For example, again, my home State of  South Dakota,  the  Standing Rock  Sioux Tribe, which sits on the border of  North and South Dakota and occupies  over 2 million acres of land, currently  has only 16 commissioned police officers. That works out to no more than  three officers a shift for over 2 million  acres of land.  To  put  that  in  perspective,  the  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe  land  is  more than two times larger than the  State of Rhode Island, which has 200  sworn State troopers plus additional  county, city, and Federal officers. That  means Rhode Island has 12 times as  many State troopers as the Standing  Rock Sioux Tribe has law enforcement  officers, to police half the land.  Rhode Island also has 10 State trooper police dogs, meaning that at any  given time, Rhode Island has more canine officers patrolling than Standing  Rock Indian Reservation has human  law enforcement officers. While there  are population discrepancies between  the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and  Rhode Island, the differences between  the two are still startling. My amendment addresses this need to increase  the number of law enforcement officers  on reservations by increasing funding  for the BIA’s public safety and justice  account.  Second, there has to be some assurance that those who have been arrested, especially  those arrested  for  violent crimes, are prosecuted to the  fullest extent of the law. Over the past  two decades, only 30 percent of tribal  land crimes referred to U.S. attorneys  were prosecuted, according to Justice  Department data compiled by Syracuse  University. This compares with 56 percent of all other cases.  My amendment addresses this need  with an increase in the BIA’s Public  Safety and Justice Account, which also  funds tribal courts, and an increase for  U.S. attorneys to prosecute crimes in  Indian country.  The bottom line is that violent crime  has become a serious problem on our  reservations, particularly on our reservations in South Dakota, and I am  determined to help reduce it. This $20  million increase in spending in fiscal  year 2009 is small, less than 4/1000 of 1  percent  of  the  total  discretionary  spending  in  fiscal year 2009  in this  budget resolution, but it will have a  big impact on the reservations that are  truly in need.  I hope my colleagues will support  this amendment so we can start restoring basic public safety to our Nation’s  Indian reservations.  METHHOTSPOTSBUDGETAMENDMENT  Mr. President, I would also like to  speak about an amendment that I filed  earlier this afternoon, amendment No.  4269.  This amendment, which would provide for a total of $99 million in COPS  meth hot spots funding for fiscal year  2009.  The underlying budget resolution assumes $70 million for this program, and  my amendment simply provides the additional funds needed for a total of $99  million, as authorized by the Combat  Meth Act. This  important  program  trains State and local law enforcement  to investigate and lock up meth offenders.  In 2006, we passed the Combat Meth  Act, which authorizes an additional $99  million per year for 5 years under the  COPS Meth Hot Spots Program. During  the budget debate last year, I offered a  similar amendment that was accepted  by unanimous consent.

154,Senate,110,-0.342,162,2008-03-12,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President,  I  would like to express my sorrow regarding  the  tragic death of one of  Washington’s  finest  young  environmental advocates Shannon Harps on  December 31, 2007. She was killed by an  unknown assailant as she was returning to her Capitol Hill apartment in  Seattle from the grocery store. Shannon’s death is a tremendous loss to our  community and the many  issues to  which she devoted her life. I join with  Shannon’s  family,  friends,  and  colleagues in the Sierra Club in mourning  the loss of this wonderful person and  fine community organizer. Though her  life was cut short, she was able to  make a large impact on the quality of  the Northwest environment.  Shannon came from her home State  of Ohio to Seattle, WA, in February  2004 to join the staff of the northwest  office of the Sierra Club. This move  joined two of Shannon’s strongest desires to work to protect our environment and to  live  in the Northwest  where she could more vigorously pursue her strong love for the outdoors.  Shannon had a wonderful sense of  humor and a style of working with people that immediately put them at ease  and made it easy for them to join her  in  protecting  our  environment  and  quality of  life. Shannon particularly  enjoyed working with high school and  college students to help them develop  their interests and talents in working  to create a better world. While Shannon’s work was directly focused on protecting our environment, from wilderness  to global warming, her values  were deeply embedded in a strong sense  of fairness and justice for all people.  In the 4 years that Shannon lived in  Washington State she helped to protect  some  of  our  finest  lands. Shannon  worked with Sierra Club volunteers  and staff from the many groups to help  move the Wild Sky Wilderness proposal  through the various steps of its arduous journey through the congressional  process. She spent countless hours on  the phone,  in meetings, and on the  trail helping to bring people together  to advocate  for protection of  these  spectacular wild  lands. Shannon believed that people were better advocates if they had firsthand knowledge  of the places they were advocating for.  As part of this belief she led countless  hikes  into  some  of Washington’s  wildest lands.  Shannon’s was a natural  leader  in  the State of Washington and worked  with colleagues around the country to  help thwart the various efforts to open  up America’s Arctic Coastal Plain to  oil and gas drilling. She was a lead organizer in the successful effort in 2006  to pass the renewable energy portfolio  standard for Washington State. And, in  the recent 2 years, much of her work  focused on building relationships with  local officials and creating public support so they would endorse the mayor’s  Climate Protection Agreement.  In her all-too-short  life, she made  contributions that benefited our community, State, and the world. She lived  her life as an example of living lightly  on the planet and engaged the people  and world  around  her with  grace,  humor, kindness, and respect. Everyone who worked with her admired her  style, tenacity, and sense of purpose,  along with her  sparkling  smile and  laugh.  Shannon loved living and working in  the Northwest. She reveled in the outdoors and nothing made her happier  than to participate in a competitive  run, or hike our high mountain trails.  Her death is a loss for us all. But her  spirit still resides with all of those  with whom she worked and walked the  trails, and  those who  continue  the  struggle to protect our lands and environment and create a more just and  fair world for us all.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO MARC HERSHMAN  ∑",2008

Over 10 community agencies  have partnered with the Coalition to infirm children, teenagers and parents about substance  abuse at this year’s event. Last year’s Drug  House Odyssey attracted over 3,000 students,  teachers, and parents, and I’m confident that  this year’s event in Cape Coral will be an even  bigger success.  For nearly 20 years, the Lee County Coalition has educated tons of thousands of students  in Southwest Florida about substance  abuse. From  school  visits  to  conferences,  community celebrations to professional counselor  training,  the Lee County Coalition has  been empowering  teenagers and  families  to  make the right choices about drug and alcohol  use. Their work  is  just a vital part of what  makes Southwest Florida a great place to live,  work and visit.  The focus of the Lee County Coalition’s annual Drug House Odyssey  is  prevention:  teaching children and  teenagers about  the  dangers of drugs and alcohol and encouraging  them  to make smart decisions about  their  health. It’s appropriate that this year’s event  will be held during National Alcohol Awareness Month. The facts are staggering: according  to  a  recent Florida Youth Substance  Abuse survey, over 35 percent of teenagers in  Lee County have reported using alcohol in the  last 30 days; nationally, the average is 16 percent.  That’s why  the good work  that  the Lee  County Coalition performs every day to help  children and teenagers make smart decisions  about drugs and alcohol is so important, and  why I ardently support their mission.  Madam Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to represent the staff and volunteers of  the Lee County Coalition  for a Drug-Free  Southwest Florida  in Congress, and  I wish  them all the best at their second annual Drug  House Odyssey.  f  HONORING DENISE JONES  HON.

157,,110,-0.519,211,2008-03-12,Mr. TOWNS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in recognition of Denise Jones who was born  and raised  in Brooklyn. Ms. Jones’ commitment  to public service originated  from her  mother and role model, Rosalie Jones, who  showed her  the benevolence of charitable  kindness to others. Her mother is currently a  retired New York City public school  teacher  who served her community for dedicated thirty-five years.  Denise Jones started her career in human  services seventeen years ago working with  MRDD at Catholic Charities as a per diem  weekend counselor. Even though she held a  printing job, she went to work at the Odyssey  House as a counselor making half the salary.  She remembers saying that the moment she  took that job, she knew It was her life’s work.  Ms. Jones has worked with  the  following  agencies:  Project Return  now  known  as  Padilla; FEGS; The Fortune Society; AHRC;  PSI Samaritan; The Partnership for the Homeless with the United Way of New York City;  Innerforce; CAMBA and Ella Place. Denise  has worked with youth at risk for incarceration,  substance  abuse MICA  patients, mentally-  challenged and  ill, ex-offenders, senior citizens, homeless, people  that suffer with HIV  and AIDS.

159,,110,-0.172,211,2008-03-12,Mr. SKELTON.," Madam Speaker,  let me  take this opportunity to publicly recognize the  contributions of Business Executives  for National Security (BENS). Founded in 1982 by  business executive and entrepreneur Stanley  A. Weiss, BENS is guided by the simple notion  that America’s security  is everybody’s  business. BENS has become a highly  respected national, nonpartisan organization of  senior executives dedicated to enhancing our  national security using the successful models  of the private sector.  The  innovative business-government partnerships that BENS has fostered over the past  two decades are uniquely positioned to help  meet the new challenges of the 21st century.  BENS is expanding these public-private partnerships  into all aspects of homeland security—tracking terrorists’ financial assets, securing  the Nation’s ports, and preparing State  and  local governments  to deal with  catastrophic events or terrorist attacks.  Business Executives  for National Security  has provided decades of distinguished service  to the Nation through a variety of programs.  These include advocating for a more modern  and agile fighting force, safeguarding and destroying  nuclear,  chemical,  and  biological  weapons in the former Soviet Union, and creating innovative partnerships around the country in which civic-minded companies volunteer  their assets and employees to assist local and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:52 Jun 26, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 J:\CRONLINE€8BA~2€8NE~2\E12MR8.REC E12MR 8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008
160,,110,0.584,218,2008-03-12,Mrs. BACHMANN.," Madam Speaker,  the  20th century was a  time of unprecedented,  historic gains in human rights, freedom, and  democracy. But it was also a century of unprecedented oppression, carnage and bloodshed.  Millions of families were exiled, tortured and  executed because of their faiths, their beliefs,  and their ancestries. Countless innocents were  marched to camps, slaughtered in streets, and  had their blood spilled as though it were nothing more than water. This religious and ethnic  genocide is a permanent stain on the history  of man.  From 1915  to 1923, Armenians were expelled from their 2,500-year homeland by the  Ottoman Empire. To achieve this travesty, the  Ottomans murdered 1.5 million innocent adults  and children, and raped and brutalized many  more. Yet to this day, this act of genocide has  been widely overlooked. In fact, it is officially  denied by today’s Turkish government. This is  unacceptable.  As we pledge ourselves to fighting evil and  preventing genocide in our modern world, we  must keep the past alive. For if we allow ourselves to forget the unthinkable crimes of the  20th century, mankind will be condemned to  bear witness to many more.  As we dedicate ourselves today to ending  the cycle of genocide, it’s important to realize  that education is a crucial step in preventing  future horror. Groups  like  the Armenian National Committee of America and others work  hard  to  raise  this critical awareness, and  I  pray that the monstrous horrors of yesterday  and today are all the lesson we ever need to  end the cycle of death and suffering.  f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO JIM  CAVALIERI  HON.

161,,110,0.593,218,2008-03-12,Mr. POE.," Madam Speaker, police officers  dedicate their lives to keeping our streets and  communities secure. They selflessly venture  into dangerous situations every day and put  their lives on the line so that the rest of us can  sleep safely. Houston Senior Police Officer  Alphonso ‘‘Al’’ Amato, Jr., is one of those elite  individuals, who dedicated his entire career to  protecting the innocent from evil-doers.  Officer Amato enrolled in the Houston Police  Academy in 1981. His first assignment upon  graduation was with the Patrol Division of the  Houston Police Department. One of his more  notable experiences occurred when he was  testifying against an aggravated robbery defendant in the 177th District Court. While he  was testifying, the defendant jumped up and  threw his  chair at  the prosecutor. Officer  Amato  responded,  like any  top-notch officer  would, and without giving it a second thought,  jumped up and immediately took the defendant into custody. He was later prosecuted as  the trial continued.  Officer Amato has been responsible for removing dangerous outlaws from the streets of  Houston. In 1983, he began working on cases  involving  juveniles and spent  the majority of  his career working in the Juvenile Division of  the police force. While working in the Juvenile  Sex Crimes Unit, he  investigated more  than  1,000  child  exploitation  cases.  Time  and  again, he has successfully arrested the worst  kind of criminal, the one who preys on innocent children.  He has a knack for difficult cases and has  taken on the most challenging, where little or  no information has been available. Each time,  he managed to track down the criminals and  bring them to justice.  Not only does Officer Amato have fine-tuned  investigative skills, he  is also known  for his  ability to manage a crime scene. He always  kept order, even in the most difficult situations,  while questioning the involved parties.  During his many years of dedicated service,  he has  received countless commendations,  expressions of appreciation, Unit Citations, an  FBI recognition for Task Force and Sting Operations, a U.S. Marshal recognition for Gang  Task Force involvement and a Houston Fire  Department  recognition. He  is also well  respected throughout the community and among  his peers.  Officer Amato’s family has a history of service. His father served in the military. Before  becoming a  law enforcement officer, Officer  Amato served in the United States Air Force  in Vietnam for 4 years. After his time in the  military, he joined the Federal Protective Services and was there until 1977, when he left to  join  the Chicago  Police Department. He  stayed in Chicago until 1981 and then began  his career with  the Houston Police Department. This year, he is retiring from a distinguished career after more  than 26 years of  service.  According  to  his  fellow  officers, Officer  Amato served  the citizens of Houston with  pride, honor and commitment. He is known as  an upstanding citizen, a patriotic American  and a devoted law enforcement officer.  I would also like to recognize the contributions  of Al’s wife, Sandy,  and  daughter,  Raven. I commend them for persevering over  the difficult job of their loved one serving as a  law enforcement officer. Many of  the most  successful officers have a significant  family  support system behind the scenes.  On  the date of his retirement, March 21,  2008, I congratulate and thank Senior Police  Officer Al Amato for wearing the badge of a  Texas  lawman with distinction while serving  the people of Houston. Future  law enforcement officers can learn by the example of Officer Amato and realize that one person truly  can make a difference.  And that’s just the way it is.

162,House,110,-0.302,5,2008-04-08,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," I thank my  friend, the distinguished delegate from  Guam, for yielding me the time.  I thank the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. WITTMAN) for his kind comments  as well. I am glad to be joined here by  the Chair of Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Chet Edwards.  Madam Speaker, a child’s process of  growing up  is difficult, but  imagine  what it must be like when one parent  or  even  both  parents  are  deployed  abroad as part of their duty  in our  Armed Forces.  While friends and relatives pray for  their safe return, no one feels the impact of deployment more than the children  of  servicemembers  in  combat  overseas. We are learning more about  the impact that living under this shadow of uncertainty has on our children.  The  incidence of military children  needing psychological counseling has  increased dramatically. Last year Children’s Hospital in the District of Columbia had over 1,000 visits from military children suffering from behavioral  and mental health problems. These are  just normal kids who want what any  child wants, their mothers and fathers  at home to tuck them in at night reassuring  them  everything will be all  right.  Today more than 2,300,000 Americans  demonstrate their courage and commitment every day to our Nation by  serving in our Armed Forces. Of these  men and women, most have families  subjected to frequent moves from one  installation to another,  long deployments abroad, and the fear that their  loved one serving overseas might never  come home.  b1430  Fifty percent of our troops deployed  overseas have children that are left behind. That is more than one million  children with at least one parent deployed overseas. Those figures, statistics, can too easily be ignored sometimes because they are abstract. But  here  is one that can’t be dismissed:  3,400 children have already lost a parent serving in the Armed Forces over  the past 6 years.  When I introduced this resolution 2  years ago, the number of children who  had lost a parent was 1,000 and now it  is 3,400. The Department of Defense understands that without the  families’  support, they will never have the soldiers’ full support.  In 1986, Secretary of Defense Casper  Weinberger declared this month the  ‘‘National Month  of  the Military  Child.’’ Every year  since, events at  military bases, forts and other installations across the Nation have been held  to celebrate the military family, replete with lots of lofty rhetoric but not  enough true attention to their needs.  Two bases in my own district, Fort  Belvoir and Fort Myer, hold annual  events  providing military kids  the  chance to be distracted a bit by just  being a kid with other kids in similar  situations. But the Congress needs to  step up.  Today I am glad to join with my colleagues,  particularly with my  colleagues who will speak here today, to  offer this resolution officially recognizing the month of April as the National Month of the Military Child, and  dedicating the Congress to pay more  attention  to  the  children  and  the  spouses of our soldiers.  My colleagues on the other side of  the  aisle, Representative  and  of North Carolina are  bipartisan sponsors  for this effort. I  thank them for their support and leadership.  This resolution is just a small way  that Congress can recognize the sacrifice these youngsters and their families are asked to make, but it is an opportunity to commit ourselves to doing  much more.  Specifically, the resolution joins the  Secretary of Defense in honoring military children, recognizing that they  too share the burden and are making a  great sacrifice in protecting our Nation.  I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the organization Kids  Serve Too. It is in my congressional  district, and is dedicated to the needs  of military families everywhere. It was  created by military families to support  other military families. Kids Serve Too  WALTERJONES ISSA sponsors activities and events for military children. It is represented in the  gallery  today  specifically by Tricia  Johnson and her daughters, Cat and  Claire, and her sister, Kathleen Murphy.  Madam Speaker, military  families  and their children deserve our heartfelt  appreciation for their sacrifice. Today  we honor them and their sacrifice and  thank you for bringing this resolution  to the floor.  ANNOUNCEMENTBYTHESPEAKERPROTEMPORE  ",2008

164,House,110,0.581,12,2008-04-08,Mr. DEAL of Georgia.," Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Madam Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 2464, which reauthorizes  the Emergency Medical Services  for  Children program.  It  is,  indeed, the  only Federal program dedicated to improving emergency care for children.  Since its inception in 1984, death rates  due to pediatric injury have dropped  some 40 percent.  The  program  provides  grants  to  States  to  improve  existing medical  emergency  services  systems, and  to  evaluate pediatric emergency care data  to  improve  future treatment efforts.  Many emergency centers do not have  all of the necessary supplies to treat  pediatric emergencies, despite the fact  that 18 percent of emergency department patients are children.  The legislation also increases the authorization for this program by 5 percent annually  for  the next  5 years  starting at $25 million in FY 2009. The  bill also extends by 1 year the period  that the Secretary of the Department  of Health and Human Services may  award grants under the program. The  bill had broad bipartisan support in the  committee, and I would urge its passage.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2008
165,House,110,-0.115,12,2008-04-08,Mr. MATHESON.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to speak in support of H.R.  2464, the Wakefield Act. I am the lead  sponsor of this legislation, along with  Representative PETERT. KINGon the  other side of the aisle.  Today, the hospital emergency department is such a fundamental part of  our health system that it’s easy to forget that emergency medicine is a relatively  new  specialty.  Emergency  rooms were  first established  in  the  1970s as medical personnel  returned  from the Vietnam War. The skills developed to save soldiers’ lives on the  battlefield were being put to use saving  victims of car crashes and other traumas.  However, the bodies of adult soldiers  are very different from those of kids.  By the early 1980s, doctors were seeing  marked disparities  in  survival  rates  among adults and children with similar  injuries. In fact, kids had twice the  death rate in emergencies as adults.  In 1984, the Emergency Medical Services  for Children program was  first  created. This unique act has driven  fundamental  changes  in  America’s  emergency medical system. Since  it  was  established,  child  injury  death  rates have dropped 40 percent. The research that resulted from this legislation helped establish pediatric emergency medicine as its own specialty.  Program grants have provided seed  money to every State and territory to  help first responders and hospitals improve children’s emergency care. In the  mid-1980s,  emergency  personnel  received little training in caring for children. Now, thanks to this program,  paramedics can be exclusively trained,  and their ambulances are stocked with  the equipment and supplies needed by  seriously injured kids.  Nowhere has this been more critical  than in rural areas where the closest  emergency room is often many miles  from the scene of an accident. Getting  it right for these small patients in the  first critical minutes often means the  difference between life and death.  Data collection and training seminars offered under this program,  including from the Emergency Medical  Services  for Children Data Analysis  Resource Center based in my district  at the University of Utah, help ensure  that best practices are developed and  disseminated across the country.  The Emergency Medical Services for  Children program’s authorization expired in September 2005. In the summer  of 2006, the Institutes of Medicine released a report which documented the  value of this program. It noted the  gaps  that  still  remain  in providing  quality emergency care  for children.  And there is still a serious gap between  the percentage of kids who end up in  the emergency room and the percentage  of  emergency  rooms  staffed,  trained and equipped to respond appropriately. The report said this program  is ‘‘well positioned to assume a leadership role’’ in closing this gap.  I am pleased  that H.R.  2464,  the  Wakefield Act, has bipartisan and bicameral  support,  including  support  from 75 of my colleagues in the House  of Representatives. The bill is endorsed  by over 50 organizations, including the  American Academy of Pediatrics, the  American College of Emergency Physicians, the American Medical Association, the Emergency Nurses Association, and many more.

166,House,110,-0.404,33,2008-04-08,Mr. BERMAN.," Madam Speaker, I rise  in strong support of this resolution and  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I would first like to  thank our Speaker, NANCYPELOSI, for  introducing this important resolution.  Speaker  commitment  to  human rights generally, and Tibetan  human rights specifically, is deep, well  established, and unwavering.  For two decades in Congress, from  her earlier stage as a junior Member to  her current position as Speaker, she  has used her powerful voice to speak on  behalf of the Tibetan people. The bipartisan delegation that she recently led  to Dharmsala to meet with the Dalai  Lama and her authorship of this resolution  demonstrate  her  continuing  dedication on the Tibetan issue. I am,  and all of us in this body should be,  grateful for her leadership.  China’s response to Tibetan protests  over the last month has been tragically  predictable. For half a century, the Tibetan people have struggled under the  repressive policies of the Chinese authorities. And sadly, the current crackdown is only the most recent example  of Beijing’s mistreatment of Tibetans.  As the world watched events unfold  inside China, we were  sickened not  only by the shock of seeing images of  Chinese authorities beating Tibetans in  the street, but also by the realization  that these are  images that we have  seen before, and fear we may see again.  It was this legacy of repression that  caused Tibetan monks to take to the  streets on March 10th to peacefully  protest Beijing’s ongoing denial of religious, cultural, and human rights for  the Tibetan people. And sadly, it was  the same legacy that caused Beijing to  respond with  excessive  force and a  propaganda  campaign  designed  to  stoke Chinese nationalism by demonizing Tibetans and their spiritual leader,  His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.  If China wishes to be viewed by the  world as a truly responsible power, it  must put an  immediate end  to  its  shortsighted  policies  towards Tibet  which are morally reprehensible, irresponsible and dangerous.  Beijing cannot credibly claim that is  seeks genuine reconciliation with the  Tibetan people when its policies force  Buddhist monks to denounce their allegiance to the Dalai Lama, deny educational and economic opportunities to  Tibetans, and threaten Tibetan culture  by encouraging an overwhelming influx  of Han Chinese migrants into Tibetan  areas. This resolution not only condemns Beijing’s crackdown on Tibetan  protesters, it also urges China to begin  to move away from its policy of repression and incitement of ethnic tensions.  The resolution calls on Beijing to  allow international monitors to assess  PELOSI the situation in Tibetan areas in China  and ensure that those injured in the  protest receive adequate medical treatment.  In addition, the resolution urges Beijing to hold direct and results-based  discussions with the Dalai Lama  in  order to come to a resolution of the Tibetan issue, one that respects Chinese  territorial  integrity and sovereignty,  but at the same time provides genuine  religious and cultural autonomy for Tibetans.  The resolution instructs the Department of State to reconsider its decision  not to include China among the countries with  the worst human  rights  records  in  the  Department’s  2007  Human Rights Report.  Madam Speaker, at this point, once  again, I would like to thank Speaker  for introducing this important  resolution, which I strongly support,  and ask my colleagues to do the same.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong and  enthusiastic support of this resolution  which forcefully criticizes the current  bloody crackdown that is taking place  in Tibet. This resolution also condemns  Beijing’s almost six decades of suppression of the religious, linguistic, economic, and cultural rights of the people of Tibet.  It was my  great  honor, Madam  Speaker, to sponsor legislation which  resulted in the awarding of the Congressional Gold Medal,  the  highest  honor that we can bestow in the United  States Congress, to His Holiness, the  Dalai Lama,  last October. My  late  friend and colleague from across the  aisle, Congressman Tom Lantos, and I  worked together to ensure that His Holiness received the official recognition  that he so richly deserves.  The Dalai Lama, who is also a Nobel  Peace Prize recipient, has won the admiration of all of us, not only for his  spiritual guidance, but also  for his  principled stand upholding the human  rights of the captive people of Tibet.  Beijing’s cynical and crass campaign  to denigrate His Holiness both inside  and outside of Tibet has drawn the  anger of both the Dalai Lama’s  followers, as well as people of good will  throughout  the  globe.  Beijing  has  called His Holiness ‘‘a splittist’’ and ‘‘a  wolf in monk’s clothing.’’ The Chinese  Embassy even recently sent out a computer link to offices here on Capitol  Hill  ludicrously comparing His Holiness to Nazis.  The people of Tibet can no longer silently bear these continued insults directed at their spiritual leader, a man  respected as an advocate of peace, of  compassion, and good will. A boiling  point was reached on March 10th, the  anniversary of  the  1959 uprising  in  Tibet and  subsequent  flight of  the  Dalai Lama into exile in India. When  demonstrators broke out in Lhasa, Beijing responded with an iron fist. In implementing a bloody crackdown, Beijing  ignored  its past pledge  to  the  International Olympic Committee to  improve the human rights situation in  China prior to this summer’s Olympics.  Chinese authorities even denied foreign  diplomats and journalists all access to  Tibet.  With  increasing numbers of American tourists traveling to Tibet every  year, the United States has a legitimate interest in having diplomatic access to Tibet for consular services. But  there should be no further openings of  more Chinese consulates in the United  States until China stops its repression  of religious and ethnic minorities and  stops violating the fundamental human  rights of its own citizens.  The crackdown continued until April  3, when Chinese troops  fired  into a  peaceful crowd of demonstrators outside a Tibetan temple  in southwest  China. The crowd had been protesting  the arrest of  two monks who were  found in possession of photographs of  the Dalai Lama. Eight were killed, including members of the Buddhist clergy.  But the Chinese regime has not only  been responsible for shedding innocent  Tibetan blood, in Darfur, in Burma, in  North Korea, and inside China itself,  bloody repression continues unabated.  b1930  This lack of liberty will further diminish the light of the Olympic torch.  The progression of  that  torch  from  London and Paris to San Francisco has  become a  focal point  for those who  would raise their voices concerning the  immense human rights abuses of the  Chinese regime.  What has begun  in Tibet will not  stay in Tibet. Already there are reports  of unrest among the Uyghur minority  as well. Beijing’s continued repression  and denial of human rights will become  the chief focal point of international  attention in the summer of the Beijing  Olympics. And, Madam Speaker, if the  present repression continues, the Beijing games will  indeed become  the  ‘‘Genocide Olympics.’’  I urge all of my colleagues to join in  vigorous approval and support for this  resolution.  With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve  the balance of my time, and  I ask  unanimous  consent  that my  good  friend the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. SMITH) be allowed to manage the  remainder of our time.  ",2008
167,House,110,-0.432,40,2008-04-08,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today  in support of House Resolution 1077,  calling on the Government of the People’s Republic of China to end its crackdown in Tibet.  The resolution also calls for the Chinese Government to enter into a substantive dialogue  with His Holiness the Dalai Lama to find a negotiated solution that respects the distinctive  language, culture, religious identity, and fundamental freedoms of all Tibetans.  The Dalai Lama has stated his willingness  to accept cultural autonomy  for Tibet under  the Chinese Constitution. He has also been  willing to negotiate with Beijing and has advanced a number of very moderate proposals  regarding Tibet’s  future  status. The Communist regime, however, has only met this attempt at accommodation with stiff opposition,  and is currently instigating yet another crackdown in the lead up to the Beijing Olympics.  To date, Congress has stood strongly by the  Tibetan people as  they bravely struggle  for  their rights:  In 1991, Congress passed a resolution stating that Tibet is an occupied country.  In  September  of  2007,  Representative  introduced House Resolution  610, expressing  the sense of  the House of  Representatives  that  the United States Government should take immediate steps to boycott the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing in  August 2008 unless the Chinese regime stops  engaging  in  serious human  rights abuses  against its citizens and stops supporting serious human rights abuses by the Governments  of Sudan, Burma, and North Korea against  their citizens. I wholeheartedly support and cosponsor this measure.  Congressman DANAROHRABACHERand I recently formed the Tibet Caucus and already  have 8 new members.  Congress awarded the Dalai Lama the Congressional Gold Medal.  We cannot stand silently by and watch as  another wave  of  brutality  and  oppression  sweeps across the country by the Beijing regime. Congress must continue to stand by the  Tibetan people and uphold  their  rights as  human beings. I urge every Member of Congress to join the Tibetan Caucus, vote ‘‘yes’’  for House Resolution 1077, and urge  the  President of the United States to issue an executive order boycotting the Beijing Olympics  and uphold the rights of the Tibetan people to  ensure their voice is not silenced.

Had  I  been present, I would have voted as follows:  On rollcall No. 154, on ordering the previous  question on H. Res. 1605, providing  for  the  consideration of H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos  and Henry J.

I want to thank Chairmen REYESand  CONYERSand for the immense time and effort  they both have put  into  this  legislation, and  also thank Speaker PELOSI for her efforts to  negotiate with the Senate to work out the differences between the two bills.  As Congress works to reauthorize and improve our foreign intelligence surveillance, it is  imperative to remember that the United States  has enemies abroad who wish to do us harm.  In  these delicate negotiations, we must be  sure to protect the civil liberties of the American people and keep our Constitution in tact,  while at the same time giving our intelligence  community all  the critical  tools necessary  to  keep us safe. I believe that with an updated  bill approved by the House, we can work out  our honest differences and come up with a  good bill that keeps the American people safe  and protects our civil rights.  While the House passed bill is a step in the  right direction, I believe certain additional provisions should be included in final compromise  legislation. It is critical that any FISA legislation works to encourage compliance with our  private sector partners in the ultimate goal of  keeping America and her people secure. As  such,  targeted  immunity  for  telecom carriers  that allegedly participated in anti-terrorism surveillance programs may become of vital importance.  I am confident that as Congress moves forward  in negotiating  sensible and effective  FISA legislation, we will continue to work toward the right balance that protects the Constitutional rights of all Americans, while also  authorizing the measures necessary to keep  the United States safe.  f  HONORING PAUL CRAWFORD  HON.

Paul, who  is  the  founder of  the Cumberland Valley Township  Historical Society  in Bedford County, will he  honored with this distinguished award at the  Bedford County Historical Society’s annual  history banquet in April.  As founder of the Cumberland Valley Township Historical Society, Paul has dedicated  much of his life to researching and preserving  the history of his community. He serves as a  true leader in the community and the Society,  directing many of the projects and events of  the organization. Paul is a constant presence  in the Cumberland Valley region, active in various community events and projects that support and promote the region.  Paul’s role as a historian cannot be denied.  He is consistently found pouring over historical  documents  and  photographs,  researching,  documenting, and cataloging the history of the  Cumberland Valley Township so  that others  can learn and remember the stories of those  that came before them. Paul is a great leader  in the community, and Bedford County is lucky  to have such a dedicated  individual working  for the benefit of the entire community.  Paul Crawford’s dedication to the preservation of his community’s history  is admirable,  and we can hope that others will follow in his  footsteps and view our history with the same  pride and honor as he has so clearly done.  f  TRIBUTE TO RITA AND JACK  SINDER  HON.

217,,110,-0.238,124,2008-04-08,Mr. BOSWELL.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today in recognition of National Public Health  Week (NPHW), April 7–13, a week to focus on  issues facing the public health and find ways  to improve the health of all. This year NPHW  focuses on how climate change  is affecting  the health of Americans and people around  the world.  The impact of global climate change on our  planet and the role we have played in speeding its progress is becoming increasingly self-  evident. The work of groups like the American  Public Health Association and committed individuals, such as  former Vice President Al  Gore, have created a heightened awareness  of what is one of the most important issues of  the coming century. This heightened state of  public awareness has led to calls across the  country for a new emphasis on reducing the  amount of greenhouse gases that are expelled  into the atmosphere by finding new, cleaner  sources of energy, reducing our consumption  of natural  resources, and using energy-efficient products.  In my home State of Iowa we are working  hard to find new and innovative ways to reduce  the amount of greenhouse gases produced. It gives me great pride to say that a recent study by the American Wind Energy Association  found  that  Iowa ranked  first  in  the  Nation  in  the percentage of wind-generated  electricity created in the State, and fourth in  total wind electricity generation.  The Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council,  ICCAC, created less than a year ago in April  2007, is charged with finding ways for Iowa to  combat climate change by becoming more energy efficient and independent. The ICCAC is  right now creating plans for the reduction of  greenhouse gases statewide with target goals  of 50 percent to 90 percent by 2050.  In February of this year Governor Chet Culver signed Executive Order Six, establishing a  new ‘‘green government’’ initiative. This initiative calls  for  improving energy efficiency  in  three areas, greening new and existing State  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:34 Apr 09, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A08AP8.031 E08APPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2008
218,,110,0.513,131,2008-04-08,Mr. SULLIVAN.," Madam Speaker,  today,  I  am  pleased  to  introduce H.R.  5721,  the  Strengthening the Safety Net Act of 2008. This  important  legislation will  increase Medicaid  Disproportionate Share Hospital  (DSH) payments  to Oklahoma and 19 other  low DSH  States and bring Oklahoma’s hospitals on  equal  footing with other States who receive  their fair share of DSH funds.  With Oklahoma having  the  fourth highest  rate of uninsured in the Nation, it is critical that  Oklahoma hospitals receive a fair distribution  of DSH funds we need to care for our indigent  population. This  legislation will  increase  the  rate that unused DSH funds are reimbursed to  these low DSH States from the current rate of  16 percent  to 19.5 percent  for  the next 5  years. The Medicare Modernization Act of  2003 statutorily defined low DSH States and  provided these States with 16 percent funding  increases each year for the last 5 fiscal years.  In total, there are 20 States that have lower  DSH allotments,  including: Alaska, Arizona,  Arkansas, Delaware, Florida,  Idaho,  Iowa,  Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The 16 percent rate expires at the end of this fiscal year, so it is critical that we increase this percentage so that  our hospitals do not feel the financial strain of  providing health care services to the indigent.  Under  the 19.5 percent  increases, Oklahoma will receive an additional $49 million in  Federal  funds which, when matched by  the  State, could amount to $75 million over the 5-  year period to allocate to Oklahoma hospitals  to help offset  the costs of uncompensated  care. Oklahoma hospitals provided $325 million  in uncompensated care costs  in 2006.  H.R. 5721 will help decrease uncompensated  care costs for Oklahoma hospitals and ensure  fairness among all 50 States by equitably distributing unused DSH Funds.  Since this bill is being solely funded through  unused Federal DSH allotments, the funding  source of the bill merely utilizes funds that are  currently being returned to the Federal Government by other States that do not use all of  their DSH  funds. These unused  funds currently are not being used  toward any other  health care related programs.  Another important issue which needs to be  addressed  is access  to quality, affordable  health care, especially within our Nation’s indigent population. Indigent patients in Oklahoma  and our Nation face a significant number of  unmet health care needs. These patients have  difficulty accessing primary, diagnostic and  specialty care and rely on hospital emergency  rooms as  their primary entry  into  the health  care system. The price of treating the indigent  at hospital emergency  rooms  is astounding  compared to care found in a primary care setting. H.R. 5721 will help bring down  these  costs and save taxpayer dollars in the process.  My legislation will create an innovative new  grant program  through  the Department of  Health and Human Services to help our Nation’s health care providers fund health access  networks, which will get low income and uninsured patients who need basic medical care  out of emergency rooms and into primary care  facilities. These networks would be required to  provide high quality primary, outpatient, inpatient and specialty care to uninsured and other  medically vulnerable populations in an effort to  reduce the costs of treating these individuals  for hospitals and taxpayers alike.  According  to a 2005 study by  the Lewin  Group on Strategic Planning  for Safety-Net  Services, Tulsa, like many communities, faces  many challenges in its delivery, financing and  organization that limit its ability to successfully  meet the needs of safety-net populations. To  give an example, the price of treating the indigent at our hospital emergency rooms is astounding compared  to  the cost of  treating  someone  in a primary care setting. To give  you an example: the Oklahoma Health Care  Authority  recently  found  that  the cost of a  claim for asthma treatment in a primary care  setting was $34.12 per claim, while the average cost for the same asthma treatment in an  emergency  room  setting was  $61.20  per  claim. While some of these claims may have  been emergencies, it is clear that treatment in  an outpatient setting  is significantly  less, almost  two  times  less,  than  treatment  in an  emergency room. Without  these networks  in  place,  the majority of Oklahoma’s uninsured  will  continue  to  go  without  a  primary  healthcare provider.  Lastly, my bill also changes the grandfather  clause for the mandatory requirement related  to hospitals providing nonemergency obstetric  services which are located in low DSH States.  The new grandfather clause will be the date  this law becomes enacted. The purpose of this  change is to remove a constraint imposed on  low DSH States whose rural hospitals stopped  providing nonemergency obstetrics during the  1990s and early 2000s due to rising liability insurance costs. The change is intended to encourage low DSH States to change their approach to funding more hospitals through the  DSH program. Should my legislation become  law, 16 additional Oklahoma hospitals will be  able to qualify for DSH funds.  I am pleased  to have  the support of  the  Oklahoma Health Care Authority,  the Oklahoma Hospital Association and advocates for  Tulsa health-plexes for the Strengthening the  Safety Net Act of 2008. As a member of the  House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee  on Health,  I am  looking  forward  to working  with my colleagues on the committee to see  this legislation become law.  f  RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN JEREMY D.

His heroism illustrates the compassion of  Iowans; willing  to  risk  their own  lives for their country. For this I offer him my  utmost respect, congratulations, and thanks.  I commend Captain Jeremy Anzevino’s courageousness and service to our great nation.  I am honored to represent Captain Anzevino  in the United States Congress and I wish him  the best in his future service to our country.  f  A  PROCLAMATION  HONORING  JAMES VAN VOORHIS FOR WINNING  THE  BOYS’  DIVISION  II  STATE BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP  HON.

222,Senate,110,-0.266,27,2008-04-21,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Madam President,  today  I  commemorate  the  life and  work of Aldo Leopold, who is remembered as a pivotal figure in the conservation movement of the early 20th  century. Today marks the 60th anniversary of Leopold’s death, and it offers us an opportunity to reflect on the  lasting contributions that he made to  our country.  Born in Burlington, IA, in 1887, Aldo  Leopold was raised near the Mississippi  River  surrounded by a vibrant ecosystem that sustained abundant waterfowl  and  other wildlife. Early  on,  Leopold developed a keen interest in  the natural world, devoting much of  his spare time to cataloguing his observations. Graduating from Yale in 1909  with a master of forestry degree, he  soon  joined the nascent U.S. Forest  Service with his first field assignments  in the American Southwest. His career  with the Forest Service brought him to  my home State of New Mexico, spending time working in the Gila National  Forest  in the southwest part of the  State  before  subsequently moving  north to the Carson National Forest,  where he reached the post of forest supervisor on the Carson.  Leopold  felt that preservation had  been neglected on the national forests.  He  foresaw  the  importance of preserving  the biological diversity and  natural systems giving way to development. He argued against the proposed  expansion of a road system into the  back country of the Gila National Forest. And in Albuquerque in 1922, he proposed instead that a large area be left  roadless and preserved for wilderness  recreation. He defined this new concept  as  ‘‘a continuous stretch of country  preserved in its natural state, open to  lawful hunting and fishing, big enough  to absorb a 2 week’s pack trip, and  kept devoid of roads, artificial trails,  cottages, or other works of man.’’ On  June 3, 1924, the Forest Service gave its  final approval and designated 755,000  acres of national forest land as the Gila  Wilderness. This  unprecedented  act  took place 40 years prior to passage of  the Wilderness Act and was the first  such designation in the world.  Leopold once wrote that ‘‘a thing is  right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community.’’ Today the Gila Wilderness is inhabited by bear, wolf, deer,  elk, beaver, bobcat, mountain lion, antelope, and wild turkey. It is a favorite  destination  for hikers, backpackers,  hunters  and  anglers who  enjoy  its  miles of fishing streams. The Gila Wilderness contains the cliff dwellings of  the ancient Mogollon civilization as  well  as  the  campsites  and  battlegrounds of the Apache and the U.S.  Cavalry. In fact, John Murray wrote in  his book, ‘‘The Gila Wilderness: A Hiking Guide,’’ that ‘‘no other wilderness  area in the Southwest so much embodies and reflects this national history and natural philosophy as does  the Gila.’’  Aldo Leopold’s concept of wilderness  evolved over time and heavily influenced policy makers and the growing  conservation  community. He wrote,  ‘‘Wilderness is the raw material out of  which man has hammered the artifact  called civilization. . . . To the laborer  in the sweat of his labor, the raw stuff  on his anvil is an adversary to be conquered. So was wilderness an adversary  to the pioneer. But to the laborer in  repose, able for the moment to cast a  philosophical eye on his world, that  same raw stuff is something to be loved  and cherished, because it gives definition and meaning to his life.’’ One person who  shared  that definition and  meaning with Aldo Leopold was former  New Mexico Senator Clinton P. Anderson. In fact, due in large part to the  conversations he had with Leopold 40  years earlier, Senator Anderson led the  effort in Congress to pass the Wilderness Act of 1964.  On April 21, 1948, at the age of 61,  Aldo Leopold died of a heart attack  while helping his neighbors  fight a  brush fire near his farm. Just 1 week  earlier, Leopold had received word that  his book of essays had finally found a  publisher. Published over a year after  his death, ‘‘A Sand County Almanac’’  remains one of Aldo Leopold’s greatest  legacies  to  the  conservation movement.  Leopold laments in ‘‘A Sand County  Almanac’’ that progress in conservation is slow—a fact that hasn’t changed  much in modern times. ‘‘Despite nearly  a century of propaganda,’’ he wrote,  ‘‘conservation still proceeds at a snail’s  pace; progress still consists largely of  letterhead pieties and convention oratory. On the back forty we still slip  two steps backward for each forward  stride.’’ On this anniversary of Aldo  Leopold death, I am pleased that the  Senate is once again making progress  on protecting wilderness, through bills  such as the Wild Sky Wilderness Act  that passed last week, and upcoming  bills  that  are making  their  way  through the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources. These bills are effective steps to preserve our heritage  for future generations, consistent with  the values for which Leopold advocated  so eloquently during his life, and I am  pleased that so many Senators, on both  sides  of  the  aisle,  have  supported  them.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO GLENNA GOODACRE  ∑",2008
223,Senate,110,0.257,27,2008-04-21,Mr. DOMENICI.," Madam President, I  wish  to  pay  tribute  to  Glenna  Goodacre, who was recently named the  Notable New Mexican of 2008 by the Albuquerque Museum Foundation. Glenna is a nationally acclaimed sculptor  whose works  include  designing  the  Sacagawea dollar coin and sculpting  the Vietnam Women’s Memorial here  in Washington, DC.  A resident of New Mexico since 1983,  Glenna was born in Lubbock, TX. She  graduated  from Colorado College  in  Colorado Springs, CO. While obtaining  her undergraduate degree, Glenna first  showed her strong ability to persevere  in  spite of defeatist-minded  individuals. She pursued her dream to become  a sculptor despite the discouragement  she faced from her professor. At her  graduation, she gave a commencement  address titled, ‘‘Success Is the Greatest  Revenge,’’ a  speech which  reflected  back on to the opposition she once  faced.  Throughout her career, Glenna has  created many  awe-inspiring  bronze  sculptures. Her most ambitious piece,  the Irish Memorial installed at Penn’s  Landing  in Philadelphia, contains 35  life-size figures. She is also credited  with the creation of two 8-foot standing  figures of Ronald Reagan. One  stands in the Reagan Library in California and the other at the National  Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum  in Oklahoma City.  Glenna’s countless accomplishments  have won her the recognition of the  New Mexico Governor’s Award for Excellence  in the Arts and the Texas  Medal of Arts. In addition to these honors, she has also been inducted into the  Cowgirl Hall of Fame in Fort Worth.  Although a fall in early 2007 threatened  to end her dreams, Glenna bounced  back to make excellent progress in her  rehabilitation and recovery. Her experience even inspired her to dedicate her  piece titled ‘‘Crossing the Prairie’’ to  St. Vincent Regional Medical Center, a  facility which was credited with saving  her life.  The Notable New Mexican program  celebrates  the  extraordinary accomplishments  of  people  like Glenna.  Every year since 2001, the Albuquerque  Museum Foundation honors a Notable  for  his  or  her  high  achievements,  strong ties to New Mexico, and contributions  to  the public good. This  year, Glenna will  join the ranks of  former Notables such as artists Wilson  Hurley and Georgia O’Keeffe, authors  Tony Hillerman and Rudolfo Anaya,  and former Governor Bruce King.

Counties  such as Crook County in Oregon have  been affected.  Congress’ inaction means that county’s road department’s been whacked.  It’s half what it was 10 years ago. Road  improvements needed for the future are  being  shelved. Maintenance projects  are being put on hold.  Crook County Judge Scott Cooper  said: ‘‘Congress just passed a new farm  bill to help get products from farm to  market, but without county payments,  the  products won’t  have  roads  or  bridges to go over.’’  H.R. 3058 would help solve this. It’s a  bipartisan,  4-year  authorization  for  county payments; yet the leadership of  this House has held it hostage on the  Union  Calendar  since  January  15.  That’s 121 days that the Democratic  leadership has prevented  the House  from voting to reauthorize the county  payments program.  It’s time to restore the Federal Government’s century-old commitment to  rural  timbered  communities, where  Federal lands make up the bulk of the  area.  I call on the Democratic leadership  once again, free H.R. 3058 for a vote,  and keep the roads and schools open in  rural America.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF BISHOP  LEWIS DOLPHIN STALLWORTH, SR.

228,House,110,-0.378,9,2008-05-15,Mr. LEVIN.," Amendment 3 concerns  unemployment compensation. It’s estimated that in the first 6 months of this  year, 1.3 million Americans will exhaust their benefits. The number of  long-term unemployed Americans is almost twice as high now as it was in the  last recession.  This is targeted at the long-term unemployed wherever they live. The Republican approach, Mr. WELLER’s approach, the President’s opposition, it’s  not targeted. It misses tens of thousands of people who are unemployed for  more than the 26 weeks. I come from  Michigan with a high unemployment  level. I want all the unemployed long-  term to be covered wherever they live.  I think it’s time that the minority  and the President get out of the offices  they reside in and get into the shoes of  typical American families.  I read a letter that came from a person  in Roseville whose husband had  lost his job as a machinist:  ‘‘With the job market as bleak as it  is today, the fear that unemployment  benefits may run out is something no  family should have to face. My husband  has been actively seeking work since  his layoff, but there’s simply nothing  to be had right now. I’ve never seen  him look so sad and upset in all our  nearly 30 years of marriage. The President and Congress must be made to understand that what is happening to the  workers of this country, and most especially, to the people of Michigan is not  something  they’ve chosen  for  themselves.’’  Opposition to extension of unemployment compensation is unconscionable.  I urge support for amendment 3.  ",2008

232,House,110,0.208,51,2008-05-15,Mr. WALSH of New York.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California  for yielding me this time.  I have the greatest respect for the  gentleman  from Wisconsin. He  is a  good Member of this body. He is my  chairman on the full committee. He is  the chairman of my subcommittee, and  on that subcommittee we work very  well together to address the key issues  of our country.  However, Mr. Speaker, the bill before  the House today is a phony bill for  many  reasons. The  rules have been  thrown under the bus. No markup, no  conference with the Senate. First and  foremost, this product is the product of  a couple of people in a body of 435. It  does not reflect the best ideas of bipartisan membership of  the Appropriations Committee. And when it leaves  this Chamber, it will not reflect the  best ideas of the 435 Members of this  House.  While I often disagree with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee  in the Senate, Senator BYRD, at least  he stood up for his committee and for  the regular order and for the prerogatives of the Appropriations Committee  in the Senate.  I have heard over the last several  days the assertion that Members of the  minority were offered an opportunity  to participate. I must have missed it; I  don’t remember any consultation.  Mr. Speaker, I am embarrassed that  the committee on which I am so revered and on which I have been so  proud to serve for so many years has  been reduced to this phony exercise.  The  reality  is  that  the majority  knows that this bill is going to be vetoed. Staff  representing  the Democratic leadership were quoted yesterday in the press as saying: ‘‘Oh, yeah,  it will be vetoed. That’s the whole part  I forgot.’’  Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, there is a  time and place for fun, but not here  and not now. The Democratic leadership, by virtue of that flippant remark  to  the press, a  remark made quite  clearly without regard to the needs of  the men and women who risk their  lives every day in service to this great  Nation seems to me to recognize that  they  are  playing  politics with  our  troops.

And no Member of Congress who  speaks out on human rights should go  to that Olympics.  Secondly,  I wanted  to  offer  an  amendment that would create a bipartisan commission, much like the Iraq  Study Group, to look at everything, to  put everything on the table, all of the  spending and tax policies, to get control of our spending and where we are.  We have $54 trillion of unfunded liabilities in this Nation.

235,House,110,-0.428,149,2008-05-15,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, after five  years, thousands of lives lost, and hundreds of  billions of dollars spent and trillions to go, the  amendments adopted today are the beginning  of a solution in Iraq. These amendments mandate the beginning of withdrawal, setting us on  a path out of Iraq, and support critical domestic and international priorities.  The language offers some of the same prescriptions in my own Iraq legislation, including  a ban on permanent bases and an increase in  contractor oversight. All too often we hear reports of billions of dollars our contractors can’t  account  for, or  the hiring of  individuals our  troops can’t rely on. This war will cost over $3  trillion, and I am pleased to see some funding  shifted to cover more of our international obligations.  I authored  legislation  to help  the 4  million displaced Iraqis and I support the funding in this bill for migration and refugee assistance and international disaster assistance. We  have a responsibility to the Iraqi people, and  as we have an obligation to provide for our  own.  Part of remedying  this  tragedy will be rebuilding the health and readiness of our armed  forces.  In my  state,  the Oregon National  Guard’s  41st Combat Brigade  Team  has  served two tours in Iraq and Afghanistan since  9/11, and  is scheduled  to deploy again  in  2009. When they return, these brave men and  women deserve the best care this country can  provide and the least we can do is make sure  education and retraining is available and affordable. I am proud to support an expansion  of the GI Bill education benefits that proved so  successful in transitioning our troops after W  orId War II and in mobilizing our economy for  succeeding generations. Frankly I find it unconscionable  that President Bush, as Commander in Chief of our armed forces, would  threaten to veto this legislation on account of  this  basic  and  historic  investment  in  our  troops.  This country is ready for change, and these  amendments are an  important step  forward.  As  this  issue  develops  over  the  coming  weeks,  I  remain  committed  to getting our  troops out of Iraq now and providing our veterans with the best care available.  ",2008
236,House,110,0.229,149,2008-05-15,Mr. CASTLE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of the three amendments before us today to  H.R. 2642. Our  troops have done  incredible  work in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it is critical  that we  provide  them with  the  protective  equipment,  operating  funds,  and  counterterrorism resources necessary to execute their  missions. For this reason, I support the funding in this package for vital priorities like mine  resistant ambush protected vehicles, IED jamming devices, military healthcare,  traumatic  brain injury research, and military family support programs.  As a  leader of  the House Committee on  Education, I have long advocated for a permanent expansion of GI Bill education benefits  for veterans. For the first time, the funding in  this package would reward those soldiers who  stepped forward in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks by allowing them to receive expanded education benefits  in proportion  to  their period of service. The men and women  who serve in our Nation’s armed forces deserve the opportunity to pursue an education  and I believe this provision represents a significant step  towards  the  realization of  that  goal.  In addition  to  financial assistance, our  government must help veterans cut  through  the red-tape surrounding GI bill benefits and I  have introduced legislation to aid our soldiers  in making this transition.  There has to be an incentive for the Iraqi  government to make political progress and it is  critical  that we begin shifting  the day-to-day  combat mission over  to  the  Iraqi  security  forces. I continue to oppose proposals in Congress that would hamstring our troops by setting a hard deadline for troop withdrawal. Last  September, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker outlined a responsible plan for  gradually redeploying our troops from Iraq and  I believe this plan should move forward in a  way that maintains security and stability in the  Middle East. Therefore, I support provisions in  this bill that would set a goal of redeploying a  majority of our combat troops from Iraq by the  end of 2009, while permitting forces to remain  in the region to conduct counterterrorism operations and assist  the  Iraqi security  forces.  Clearly, our military and foreign policy leaders  must retain the ability to react to conditions on  the ground and I believe this provision allows  them  the appropriate  flexibility  in executing  their mission without conditioning troop funding on arbitrary  timelines or an  immediate  deadline for troop withdrawal.  Additionally,  I support  language  in  the bill  that would improve transparency and oversight  of contractors to prevent waste and abuse in  government spending. In the same way, I support sections of the bill that would require better accountability from the Iraqi government by  providing an  incentive  for a greater  Iraqi  investment in the country’s reconstruction. Embracing a comprehensive regional diplomatic  initiative, ensuring American soldiers are properly  trained and prepared  for deployments,  and prohibiting torture are also key provisions  which I continue to support.  Lastly, while I intend to vote in favor of this  emergency spending package,  I continue  to  have deep concerns about  the manner  in  which it was brought forward. In my estimate,  the leaders of the House have unfairly manipulated congressional rules in severely limiting  debate on this measure and restricting input  from both Republicans and Democrats. Rather  than using this issue as a tool to score points  politically, Members  from both sides of  the  aisle should come  together  in support of a  workable policy to bring our troops home.  To date, over 4,000 American soldiers—including sixteen brave Delawareans—have lost  their lives in Iraq. Close to 500 U.S. service  members have also died in Afghanistan. Mr.  Speaker, I call on my colleagues to embrace  the substantive areas of this bill where we can  find agreement, and join me in committing to  a bipartisan approach  for achieving stability  and bringing our troops home to their families.  ",2008
237,House,110,-0.056,149,2008-05-15,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of H.R. 5740, the Post 9/11 Veterans  Education Assistance Act—bipartisan  legislation that honors our men and women in uniform and strengthens our military.  Since World War II, our nation has offered  education benefits to returning GIs. The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, the first  GI Bill, which was passed unanimously by this  House, paid for the tuition, books, fees, training costs, and even a monthly stipend for our  returning veterans.  After World War II, nearly 8 million veterans,  out of a wartime veteran population of 15 million, used the original GI Bill to earn an education. The economic  return was unprecedented. For every dollar we spent on the GI  Bill, we generated 7 more  into our national  economy. Millions of newly-educated veterans  led our Nation in business and innovation and  created  the American middle class.  It’s no  wonder the GI Bill of 1944 is regarded as one  of the most successful pieces of legislation to  earn this House’s approval in the 20th Century.  Since that time, Congress has passed other  GI bills, but over time, the value of the education benefit has declined. The current Montgomery GI Bill, for example, was designed for  peacetime service, and  is not meeting  the  needs of our newest generation of veterans,  many of whom are returning from combat in  Iraq and Afghanistan.  Our veterans—whether active duty, Reservists or National Guardsmen—deserve an education benefit that accounts for the stress of  war and keeps up with the rapidly increasing  cost of a higher education. That is why, with  the backing of a broad, bipartisan coalition, I  introduced H.R. 5740, the Post-9/l1 Veterans  Educational Assistance Act.  Under  the  legislation, GIs  returning  from  Iraq or Afghanistan would receive up to four  academic years of education benefits, including stipends for housing and books. They can  even use  their benefits at private schools  through the Yellow Ribbon G.I. Education Enhancement Program, in which the federal government will match, dollar for dollar, any voluntary  additional  contributions  to  veterans  from institutions whose tuition is more expensive than the maximum educational assistance  provided under this legislation.  Veterans would even have up to 15 years  after they leave active duty to use their education benefits. I am pleased that this bill was  included as part of the emergency war funding  measure that the House is considering today  because  I believe  taking care of  those who  serve in war is a cost of war. America should  never  fight wars without  taking care of our  own. However, I am deeply troubled by how  we got to this point, and am disappointed that  this issue has become politicized.  When I was elected to this House, my constituents asked me to work in a bipartisan way  to  find reasonable solutions  to our common  problems. And that is what I tried to do with  this GI Bill. Working together with my Democratic and Republican colleagues, we attracted  more than two-thirds of the House as cosponsors. Ninety-two Republicans, nearly half of  the minority party’s membership,  lent  their  support. But instead of using that coalition to  secure overdue educational benefits  for our  veterans, our leadership has allowed ideological gotcha games to prevail.  What began as an attempt to fix a broken  promise to our veterans has devolved into a  fight over who can score  the most political  points. As a result, instead of sending a veto-  proof bill  to  the Senate, we are sending a  lesser bill with a  less certain outcome. This  does not hurt any of our political opponents,  Mr. Speaker; it only hurts our veterans. And,  frankly, they deserve better. Our soldiers and  veterans deserve a House whose actions  matches its rhetoric. If we mean what we say,  that taking care of those who serve is truly a  cost of war,  then  the GI Bill should be  included as a part of our war spending.

238,House,110,0.598,163,2008-05-15,Mr. GOHMERT.," Mr. Speaker,  this  afternoon an extraordinary thing did  happen when we had a vote on a supplemental with all kinds of strings attached to  it to  fund our troops  in  harm’s way.  The Democrats have the majority.  They have the ability to pass that  funding without a bit of help from the  Republicans.  Many of us on the Republican side of  the aisle were quite concerned, however, with the strings, with the linkages that were made to this bill to help  our troops do their job. One, for example, was that in the second amendment,  which we knew would pass, provisions  there existed to create hard and fast  deadlines for pulling our troops out of  Iraq.  We all want to see our troops home.  We all want to see our troops back  with us. And those of us who go over to  Iraq and see them in harm’s way, we  long for the time of having them home  completely. But the vast majority of  those guys in record numbers re-enlist  because they know they’re doing good.  They know they are making a difference. And when you go over there,  you see it. I was in Kurdistan in December, in the northern area of Iraq.  Construction  booming,  things  going  well.  We have made a difference with the  surge. It is a profound difference. We  have al Qaeda on the run. They’re making  last-ditch efforts to try to stop  what’s going on. We have the Iraqi people that are there working for themselves, more  soldiers, more  police  trained  than ever. There are  really  good things going on. And were we to  pass a supplemental that was linked to  that second amendment with the time  deadlines, the message would be a message of hope for all those who hate us  and want to destroy us. And that is: ‘‘If  you will just hold on a little bit longer,  we will have the Americans put their  heads between their legs and go cowering away, as they did  from Vietnam.’’ We could have won Vietnam; we  can succeed in Iraq.  The great state of Iraq is so close to  governing itself. Just like John Adams  wrote  to Abigail, what people have  only dreamed of, governing themselves  is so close, within our reach. We can’t  give it up now. It’s so close. Iraq is  there. We cannot hand our enemies and  the Iraqi enemies, the enemies of liberty, this kind of win.  So we voted ‘‘present.’’ If the Democrats had had enough votes, then they  would have passed the supplemental by  itself and it would have been linked to  the second amendment that would have  required the time deadlines for withdrawal and would have given hope. As  it was, we couldn’t vote against our  troops, many  of us,  but we  voted  ‘‘present.’’  The first amendment that we took up  this afternoon failed; so now we have  got to come back with a clean supplemental to help our troops.

240,Senate,110,0.494,177,2008-05-15,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. President, it gives  me great pleasure to come to the floor  in the final hours of the debate over agricultural policy in this country and  to, first and foremost, thank the two  principals, who are here on the floor,  the chairman and ranking member of  the Senate Ag Committee. They have  done yeoman work in a very difficult  process—15 titles and 673 pages of policy—in what is, without question, one  of the most complicated efforts at putting public policy and interest groups  within the agricultural community together in some degree of harmony. I  thank my colleagues for the work they  have done.  Mr. President, I will be brief, as I  have already come to the floor several  times to discuss the valuable programs  included in this bill. But I would be remiss not to take the opportunity to  thank my colleagues—and this Congress—for producing a good product for  the American people.  We have been ‘‘tangled in inaction’’  on so many issues. The American people want a functional Congress.  The 2008 farm bill conference report  represents a monumental feat for the  U.S. Congress. Every 5 years, we undertake the task of reauthorizing our farm  policy. This version includes 15 titles;  673 pages.  Though  some who  have  not  yet  served on an agriculture committee  during the reauthorization of a farm  bill may disagree, let me assure you  this  is one of the most complicated  pieces of legislation considered by Congress, and it is also one of the most important.  In an age of  skyrocketing energy  prices, economic uncertainty, and now  a global food crisis, there is at least  one thing we should be able to be certain of: our Nation’s food security. We  cannot take for granted our ability to  feed ourselves, lest we become dependent on other countries for our food in  addition to our oil.  How do we achieve  food security?  Here are a few key principles.  First and foremost, we enact policy  designed to keep our  food producers  productive and profitable, and ensure  access to those foods for all Americans.  This includes things such as a safety  net to protect farmers from volatile  price swings; and nutrition programs  that give access to  fresh  fruits and  vegetables in schools.  We  enact policy  that  incentivizes  state-of-the-art conservation practices  to encourage the best possible stewardship of our agricultural lands. This will  ensure these lands stay productive and  profitable for future generations. And  we enact policy that helps American  agriculture continue to diversify—including becoming a larger player not  only in our food security, but also in  our energy security.  This bill does just that. This bipartisan work product—aptly named the  Food, Conservation and Energy Act of  2008—sets a strong and secure direction  for our food, conservation and energy  future.  The bill has broad support from virtually every corner of my State of  Idaho, and every corner of the Nation.  Congress has heard from rural farmers to urban food banks calling for passage of this vital piece of legislation.  Mr. President,  500  farm, conservation, nutrition,  consumer, and  religious groups sent a letter supporting  passage of the farm bill conference report.  These groups—with one voice—recognized that the bill ‘‘makes significant  farm policy reforms, protects the safety net for all of America’s food producers, addresses important infrastructure needs  for  specialty  crops,  increases  funding to  feed our nation’s  poor, and enhances support for important conservation initiatives.’’  It is not a perfect bill—we all will  admit this—but it is a great bill. I commend my colleagues for their work.  The President has stated his intention to veto this bill. It is not often  that I so strongly disagree with our  Commander  in Chief, but on this  I  must. There are too many great things  in this bill to deny its passage over a  few areas of disagreement, too many  important  things  for my State  of  Idaho, and for the Nation.  We began several years ago to ensure  that specialty crops were adequately  recognized in this new farm bill. We  now have a new title devoted to horticulture  and  organic  agriculture.  It  dedicates approximately $3 billion for  specialty crop, pest and disease, nutrition, research, trade and conservation  priorities important to this vital industry that represents nearly half of all  crop cash receipts in our country, including: $466 million for Specialty Crop  Block Grants to support local efforts to  enhance competitiveness of local products; $1 billion to expand the Fresh  Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program to  all  50 States—which will  help  our  school children develop healthy eating  habits; $377 million for a pest and disease program to combat costly damage  to crops such as our famous potatoes;  $230 million for the Specialty Crop Research Initiative to address food safety,  mechanization,  plant  breeding,  and  other priorities; $59 million for trade  assistance and market promotion to  maintain and grow our international  markets; and many other programs.  Idaho’s  famous potatoes, our burgeoning table grape and wine grape industry, our apples and onions and carrots  and  nursery  and  ornamental  crops—and this just touches the surface of both our current production and  our potential to continue to diversify.  Now, it should be noted that this is  only one part of the effort to ensure  the competitiveness of our specialty  crop industry. The next step is to ensure that we have an adequate workforce to conduct the labor in which the  average American refuses to participate. The harvesting of those healthy  fruits and vegetables—this, I contend,  is as  important, or more  important,  than  these  ‘‘competitiveness’’  priorities that we have finally set forward  in the farm bill. So our work is not  done.  And I could go on for a great deal of  time, talking about: the commodity  programs that create a vital safety net  for our wheat, barley, peas,  lentils,  chickpeas, oilseeds, sugar, wool producers, and so on; the conservation  programs that will help Idaho’s booming dairy  industry address  environmental  challenges  associated  with  their growth, and our crop producers to  incorporate better  stewardship practices; the nutrition programs that are  vital to improving the health of our  youth; the rural development programs  that will ensure  funding  for  things  such as water and wastewater programs, broadband, and rural housing;  the energy programs that will help us  reach the 36 billion gallon RFS by creating new incentives for cellulosic ethanol and beginning to pare down the  subsidy  for  corn-based  ethanol;  the  wildlife programs, such as the provision authored by my colleague from  Idaho, that creates incentives for endangered species recovery; the forestry,  trade, credit, disaster programs.  Those programs that will benefit the  Nation—and my State of Idaho in particular—are simply too vast to cover.

243,Senate,110,-0.319,233,2008-05-15,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, I rise  today in support of S.J. Res. 28, a joint  resolution  disapproving  the Federal  Communications  Commission,  FCC,  rule  relaxing  newspaper-broadcast  media cross-ownership.  Like many of my colleagues, I am  deeply  troubled by  the FCC’s  rulemaking that would allow greater consolidation of our media. The media is a  tremendous force in our society. It can  inform, educate, and entertain, as well  as nourish our democratic dialogue.  Unfortunately, the media also has less  savory powers.  In recent years, we have seen an increase in coarse and violent programming, coupled with a decrease in local  news and hardhitting journalism. To  say these trends are not in the best interest of the American people, and especially our youngest citizens, is clearly an understatement.  In addition, as corporate ownership  over  our media  grows more  concentrated, we see less and less of the  diversity of our Nation. When programming is the same from coast to coast,  our airwaves will no longer reflect the  rich mosaic of our country and our  citizens.  Such  a  landscape  should  prompt the FCC to act with an overabundance of caution, but it has not.  Five years ago,  the FCC  substantially relaxed the rules that govern  media ownership in this country. Millions of Americans contacted the FCC  to complain. The U.S. Senate voted to  support a ‘‘resolution of disapproval’’  in response to the FCC’s decision. Next,  the courts got involved, and the Third  Circuit Court of Appeals shipped the  agency’s handiwork right back to the  FCC.  In 2006, the FCC began a new rulemaking, and in November of 2007, the  Commerce Committee held a hearing  to discuss the effects of consolidation  on localism and diversity in news and  entertainment.  Over the following month, the Senate  made clear to the Commission that it  had serious concerns about the FCC’s  process and its apparent rush to issue a  new rule. But on December 18, 2007,  over the objections of Commissioners  Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein,  the FCC approved a relaxed set of ownership rules under which newspaper-  broadcast cross-ownership  is permissible in the top 20 markets.  I commend Senator DORGAN for introducing S.J. Res. 28, a joint resolution disapproving the FCC rule. I am  pleased to join him as a cosponsor of  this resolution. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting S.J.  Res. 28.  Together we can send a strong and  united message that media diversity is  clearly  in the national  interest and  that the U.S. Senate will defend that  interest with all the tools at its disposal.  ",2008
244,Senate,110,-0.328,233,2008-05-15,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I rise in  strong support of the resolution of disapproval of the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, recently issued  rules on media cross-ownership. I want  to commend my colleague from North  Dakota for his leadership on this most  important of  issues. This  resolution  will nullify the ill-considered and hastily-passed rules pushed through by the  FCC in December of last year.  Over the last several years, the effects of media consolidation have become extremely clear to the American  people: Less local control and community-oriented programming; less independently  produced  programming;  fewer divergent views and opinions;  fewer minority-owned broadcast  stations.  And now, the FCC has green-lighted  further media concentration by voting  to overturn a 32-year-old rule prohibiting  the  cross-ownership  of  newspapers and broadcast stations—a rule  that could impact markets in which  nearly half of  the American public  lives and works.  Put  simply,  the FCC  rule change  would harm local and independent owners and help big media owners. In particular, the change further disadvantages minority media owners. While  such owners control a mere 3 percent of  the Nation’s commercial TV stations,  as many as  90 percent of minority  media owners would be subject to these  new rules. Further consolidation will  simply reduce the number of opportunities for minorities to enter the market while putting those already in the  market more at risk of being forced  out by larger media conglomerates.  The FCC argues that this rule is necessary to ‘‘save’’ the newspaper industry. But as an  internal FCC  study  showed, despite all the stories we are  hearing  about  newspaper  cutbacks,  publicly traded newspapers earn 16 to  18 percent annual rates of return. An  internal FCC memo found the industry  as a whole to be profitable. That is to  say nothing of the fact that the FCC  has given no compelling reason for it  to be in the newspaper business in the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:39 Sep 14, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD08\RECFILES\S15MY8.REC S15MY8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008

Mary Ellen Tolliver was born on September  1, 1915 in Richmond, Virginia; to the union of  the late Thomas Day and Georgetta Walker-  Day. Mary Ellen Day was the oldest of four  children.  On Tuesday, May 13, 2008 at 2:30 a.m.,  God called Mary Ellen Day home for she had  done her part. ‘‘Peace I leave with you, my  peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth,  give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled  neither let it be afraid’’ (John 14:27).  Mary Ellen Day moved to Pennsylvania as  a young child with her family where she attended the public school system. Mary Ellen  Day was married to John L. Toliver in 1935  and  they attended Enon Tabernacle Baptist  Church in Germantown, where she worshiped  until her passing. John and Mary Toliver never  had  children of  their own, but  considered  many  in  the community as  their own  family  and provided them with values and traditions  that will live on forever.  Mary Ellen Toliver dedicated her life to the  field of mental health. She worked as a nurse  at the Byeberry State Mental Hospital in Pennsylvania, also known as the Philadelphia State  Hospital for 40 years from where she retired.  While at Byeberry, Mary Ellen Toliver became close to and took two long-term patients  from Byeberry into her home in Germantown.  Julia and Sweeney were abandoned by their  families, but  felt at peace with Mary Ellen  Toliver. Mary Ellen Toliver shared her home  with both ladies until their passing; Julia for 24  years  and Sweeney  for  30  years.  They  brought her great joy.  Mary Ellen Toliver, was preceded in death  by her husband John L. Toliver, her brother  Sonny Day, and sister Mabel Day. Mary Ellen  Toliver leaves to cherish her lasting memories;  her sister Willeta Day, and her sister Aquilla  Laws. Mary Ellen Toliver  leaves a host of  nieces, great-nieces, nephews, great nephews, cousins, and the Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church family.  HON.

246,,110,0.367,254,2008-05-15,Mr. BONNER.," Madam Speaker,  it  is with  great pride and pleasure that I rise to honor  the  long and distinguished career of Tom  Hamby, on the occasion of his retirement from  AT&T Inc.  A native of Social Circle, Georgia, Tom  earned a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering at the University of Georgia. He was  commissioned in the Army Corps of Engineers  and went on to serve 10 years in the reserves  and National Guard.  As  the Birmingham News described Tom,  he  is  ‘‘one of Birmingham’s most  influential  business  leaders.’’ With a career spanning  over 37 years, Tom has served in various assignments in the network, marketing, and regulatory departments in Georgia, Alabama, and  Washington, DC, and he was appointed to his  current position, AT&T president—Alabama, in  1999.  In  the early 1990s, Tom  led  the effort  to  bring caller identification and voice mail products to customers. During his tenure as president,  the Alabama Legislature passed  landmark telecommunication legislation, which led  to greater competition,  investment, customer  choice as well as new services.  Tom is also well-known in Birmingham and  throughout the State of Alabama as a leader  in both  the business and civic communities.  He  is  chairman of  the board of  the Birmingham Museum of Art and the Greater Alabama Council of Boy Scouts of America. He is  a past chairman of Birmingham’s Metropolitan  Development Board, the Business Council of  Alabama,  and  the  Birmingham  Regional  Chamber of Commerce. He is a current director on the boards of Protective Life Corp. and  the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me  in  recognizing a dedicated  community  leader and  friend  to many  throughout  the  State of Alabama. I know his family; his wife,  Wyona; and his many friends join me in praising his accomplishments and extending thanks  for his service over the years on behalf of the  city of Birmingham and the State of Alabama.  Tom will surely enjoy the well deserved time  he now has to spend with family and his first  grandchild, who  is due  this summer.  I wish  him the best of luck in all of his future endeavors.

247,,110,-0.565,261,2008-05-15,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Madam Speaker,  as Chairman of the Commission on Security  and Cooperation  in Europe,  I would  like  to  draw attention and concern to the case of Mr.  Emanuel Zeltser, a U.S. citizen who was detained March 12th upon his arrival in Minsk,  Belarus, charged with  ‘‘use of  forged documents.’’ In the entire time that Mr. Zeltser has  been detained, he has only been allowed visitation by the U.S. Embassy twice, on March  21st and April 25th. Upon the latter visit it was  noted by the U.S. consul that Mr. Zeltser had  been beaten several  times and appeared  in  greatly weakened health. Mr. Zeltser suffers  from Type 2 diabetes and a severe form of arthritis. Though his condition causes him severe pain and has further deteriorated during  his incarceration, the authorities in the detention facility where he is held have reportedly  denied him necessary medications. Without  proper medications, Mr. Zeltser may not be  able to survive the harsh conditions of his detention. Furthermore, according to his lawyer,  Belarusian authorities have recently extended  the period of Mr. Zeltser’s term of detention.  It is incumbent upon the Belarusian government to provide Mr. Zeltser full consular access, proper medical care, and ensure that he  is not subjected to further physical abuse and  degrading treatment—consistent with its international  legal obligations and basic human  rights standards.  Time is of the essence in Mr. Zeltser’s case,  as further delays could lead to further deterioration of his health to the point of endangering  his life.  Madam Speaker, I call upon the Belarusian  authorities  to ensure  that Mr. Zeltser  immediately receives the medication his doctor has  prescribed, and  is protected  from  further  ill-  treatment, given access to U.S. consular representatives and any medical attention he may  need. On April 25, the State Department requested the Government of Belarus to release  Emanuel Zeltser on humanitarian grounds.  I  urge the Belarusian Government to favorably  consider that request.  f  CELEBRATING TAYLOR’S 40TH  ANNIVERSARY  HON. JOHN D.

Incorporated as a city on May 13, 1968,  and named after our country’s 12th president,  Taylor’s roots as a community date to the mid-  19th Century. What began as a largely agricultural town grew into a prosperous and diverse  city which features ample retail and industry  for employment and safe neighborhoods  for  her citizens.  Taylor first began as a Township when residents succeeded  in petitioning  for  their own  government  in 1847. Like many Michigan  communities, Taylor began  to  thrive when  Ford Motor Company  opened  the  nearby  Rouge Plant. The Rouge, as it was often simply called, provided over 100,000 jobs at one  time during the 1930s. This mighty economic  engine created a boom in the burgeoning town  that would carry it through the Great Depression and World War II, during which it played  an invaluable part of the American war effort.

Dale Engquist has been with  the National  Park Service for 19 years. He has proven his  leadership skills  through developing partnerships and cooperative programs and providing  collaborative opportunities  for a diverse and  complex audience. During Mr. Engquist’s extensive career with the National Park Service,  he  increased  the  lakeshore at  the  Indiana  Dunes by 15 percent and developed an educational program that serves over 35,000 students each year at the Paul Douglas Center  for Environmental Education. Mr. Engquist is  also  responsible  for  the partnership  formed  between  local  community  governments,  LaPorte County, and the State of Indiana that  collaborated  to build a new visitor center,  which is set to increase contacts with visitors  to the area by 500 percent.  Mr. Engquist’s vision and passion led to the  development of a network of community organizations, state agencies, and environmental  organizations  to  combat  invasive  species,  which have been a pervasive problem along  the southern tip of Lake Michigan. His participation on the Executive Steering Committee of  the Chicago Wilderness greatly increased the  awareness of the region to the biologically diverse and sensitive nature of  the  Indiana  Dunes. Mr. Engquist has also signed a sister  park  agreement with Kampinoski National  Park of Poland, formally providing opportunities for each park to meet and exchange ideas  and information about resource management  and education.  Due  to his extended commitment  to both  residents and visitors to Indiana’s Second District, it is my pleasure to rise today to honor  Dale Engquist for receiving the Distinguished  Service Award for his long and accomplished  career with the National Park Service.  f  NATIONAL TRAIN DAY  SPEECHOF  HON.

250,,110,-0.514,268,2008-05-15,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  express my support of H. Res. 1176, Supporting the goals and ideals of National Train  Day, as a Member who appreciates and recognizes the vital role of trains in our economy  and as a passenger who commutes between  New York and Washington, DC, on the Amtrak  Acela. I find my commute by train a convenient, efficient and relaxing way to travel that  enables me to read and work in comfort and  arrive refreshed, usually on time, and downtown, closer to my destination. I praise the efforts of visionary leaders who over the years  have advocated  the preservation and modernization of passenger rail service.  Trains have played a vital and historic role  in  this country,  transporting cargo and passengers since  the early 19th century, when  the first steam locomotive was built by engineer George Stephenson. Without the creation  of the steam engine, the Industrial Revolution  would not have occurred and our great country would not have been able to prosper as  much as  it has.  In 1869,  the  first  transcontinental railroad was completed. Known as  the ‘golden pike,’ it connected both the east  and west coast of the United States, linking  our Nation and bridging the geographical divide like never before.  Although  there are a greater number of  modes  of  transportation—planes,  cars,  buses—than  there were  in  the early 1800s,  trains are still  relied on  to  transport  large  amounts of freight and millions of people everyday. They have  reduced  congestion  in  major cities, helping to reduce pollution connecting people in rural areas to urban centers.  The history of trains has come a long way,  from burning coal and going only 130 km/h to  high-speed trains that can go from 200 km/h  to 350 km/h and are electrically driven by  overhead cables. Trains are constantly changing and improving. Due to global warming and  greenhouse effects, trains now run more fuel  efficiently, emitting only 0.2 percent of  the  travel industry’s total greenhouse gases.  I support National Train Day because  the  train industry has been an important part of  America’s story and  its economic development, as well as a large part of Americans’  day-to-day lives.  f  TRIBUTE TO HARVEY SCHECTER  HON.

When I meet with various officials  throughout my district and see  the  job  that  they do,  I am continually  impressed by  the sense of honor and the level of commitment with which  they so unselfishly serve.  Many of them continually place their lives on  the line in order to protect the families and individuals in our area. Some have indeed given  their lives in the line of duty, and for that there  is no measure of gratitude that can possibly  rise to the level of what our community owes  them.  These dedicated  individuals give of  their  time, energy, and heart. They ask  for  little  other than our support. They crave no spotlight or public applause. They serve out of a  sense of deep love for their community and  out of a sense of purpose in ensuring the citizenry is protected and justice is served.  I would like to especially recognize a fallen  officer whose name was added to the wall on  the National Police Memorial in Washington,  D.C.  this week,  in a ceremony attended by  Jacksonville Sheriff Rutherford.  Jacksonville Sheriff’s Officer Eric Bell was  killed, on duty, on October 12, 2007 when a  vehicle pulled in front of his patrol car. Officer  Bell was returning from a call on Heckscher  Drive when a van  traveling on New Berlin  Road collided with his cruiser.  Officers like Eric Bell embody the belief that  there is no greater purpose than serving our  fellow neighbors, and Officer Bell gave his life  in this noble effort. In doing so, he and other  law enforcement officials model character and  integrity for generations to come.  It is with a grateful heart and a sense of tremendous pride  that  I  recognize and honor  Jacksonville Sheriff’s Officer Eric Bell and  each individual serving our community in a law  enforcement capacity during  this 2008 National Law Enforcement Week.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

The Annual Ohio Business Women’s Conference  is  the  largest event of  its kind  for  women  in business and provides business  owners with  the  information and  tools necessary to expand their market. The theme for  this year’s conference is ‘‘Bridging Success’’  and will  feature over  five hundred women  business owners, entrepreneurs and corporate  exhibitors. The mission, put forth by the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce for Ohio and the  Hispanic Business Association is to promote  women  business  enterprises  through  all  stages of development. This unique and important event provides women business owners with  the  forum  to display  their products  and services to America’s leading corporations  and government agencies, who join the conference from across the nation as sponsors,  exhibitors, and attendees. This year’s event  will provide women business owners and entrepreneurs with networking activities, workshops, panel discussions, and matchmaking  procurement sessions.  I also stand in recognition of the Hispanic  Business Association (HBA) for their contributions and  leadership  in promoting and supporting women business owners in the Greater  Cleveland Area. The Hispanic Business Association grew out of the vision of local Hispanic  business owners in 1981 who were startled by  the low participation of the Hispanic community in the private and public sector. Since its  official  incorporation as a nonprofit  in 1983,  the HBA has worked  to  fulfill  its mission of  promoting Hispanic business  interest and  its  economic development and expansion through  strategic  partnerships,  technical  assistance  and advocacy.  Madam Speaker and colleagues, please join  me in recognition of this year’s Annual Ohio  Business Women’s Conference and Expo as  well as in recognition of the Hispanic Business  Association  for  their diverse and extensive  service to business owners and entrepreneurs  in the Greater Cleveland Area.  f  THE DAILY 45: SALVADORAN IMMIGRANT FAMILY’S MURDER SUICIDE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 15, 2008  ",2008

256,,110,-0.556,4,2008-05-23,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Speaker, Employers who misclassify their employees as independent contractors  rob workers of needed  pay and benefits and cost government at all  levels substantial uncollected  revenues—resources that are needed for vital government  programs and services.  Yet misclassification is widespread. According to the General Accounting Office, at least  10 million workers in the U.S. are classified as  independent contractors, and studies show  that as many as 30 percent of employers  misclassify their workers. Why do they do it?  They misclassify to avoid the cost of payroll  taxes,  insurance  premiums  and mandated  benefits, and to boost their profits. In fact, the  Department of Labor has concluded that the  number one reason for misclassification is to  avoid  the payment of workers compensation  premiums, as well as workplace injury and disability-related disputes.  The cost is high for employees, who when  misclassified, lose out on employee benefits,  including those that are exempt from taxation  or receive tax-deferred benefits, such as retirement,  life  insurance, accident and health  coverage, qualified tuition reduction programs,  benefits under a cafeteria plan, educational  assistance programs and dependent care assistance programs. Additionally misclassified  workers are not afforded even minimal workforce  protections,  including workers  compensation, minimum wage,  overtime  pay,  health and safety requirements and the right  to join a union. And eligibility for Medicare, Social Security and Unemployment compensation is negatively affected as well.  The cost to society is high as well, and it is  estimated that billions of dollars are lost each  year; money that would otherwise be paid to  the States and  the Federal Government  in  taxes. Despite,  this enormous problem,  the  Department of Labor (DOL) has failed not only  to crack down on  this practice by enforcing  current laws, but has failed to coordinate with  other agencies to address the issue. In addition, it is unclear under the law which standard  should be employed  for determining who  is  and who is not an independent contractor.  The Employee Misclassification Prevention  Act of 2008, which Representatives ANDREWS,  MICHAUD, MILLERand I are introducing today  attacks the problem of misclassification head-  on by:  Clarifying  that employee  records must  reflect the worker’s accurate status or classification as an employee or non-employee and that  it is a violation of the Act to make an inaccurate classification.  Requiring employers to provide employees  and non-employees notice of their status and  notice of their rights to challenge that classification.  Providing  additional  penalties  for  misclassification as well as  increased penalties for violations that are willful or repeated.  Requiring  state  unemployment  insurance  agencies to conduct audits to identify employers who are misclassifying employees.  Mandating the Department of Labor (DOE)  to develop a system  to  track and monitor  States’ effectiveness in identifying employers  who misclassify.  Explicitly allowing DOL and  the  Internal  Revenue Service (IRS)  to refer  incidents of  misclassification to one another; and  Requiring DOL  to perform  targeted audits  focusing on employers in industries that frequently misclassify employees.  We know that there are good employers out  there who pay their employees fair and honest  wages. This bill is to protect bona fide employees from the 30 percent who don’t.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON.

ANDREWS  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  MIKE LYNN  along  MICHAUD,  Wednesday, May 21, 2008  ",2008
257,,110,-0.297,4,2008-05-23,Mr. ANDREWS.," Madam Speaker,  with my  colleagues Congresswoman  WOOLSEY, Chairman GEORGEMILLER, Congressman  Congressman  MCDERMOTTand almost all of the Democratic  Members of the Committee on Education and  Labor, I rise today to introduce the Employee  Misclassification  Prevention  Act  of  2008,  EMPA.  The  egregious  practice  of misclassifying  workers as independent contractors needs to  end. EMPA  is pro-employee, pro-employer  and pro-taxpayer. The bill will protect employee benefits, remove incentives for employers  to misclassify  their workers, and ensure  that bad employers don’t line their own pockets with unpaid payroll taxes.  In the last decade we have seen a questionable  increase  in  the amount of  individuals  classified as independent contractors. In 1984,  which was  the  last  time a comprehensive  misclassification study was conducted by an  oversight agency on  this  issue,  the  Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) estimated that 15 percent of employers misclassified 3.4 million  workers as independent contractors. As a result, $1.6 billion or $2.72 billion in inflation-adjusted 2006 dollars in Social Security, unemployment and income taxes was stripped from  the hands of the Government and went into  the pockets of tax evaders. Furthermore, the  3.4 million workers who were misclassifed  were stripped of many of their basic, but essential, employee rights.  In some cases, classifying an individual as  an  independent contractor  is quite right and  quite appropriate. If someone is retained for a  limited purpose, usually for a limited time, to  do a specific job function for an employer, it is  quite necessary and appropriate that that person not be treated as an employee for reasons of flexibility, and for reasons of fair compensation.  However, when an individual is considered  an independent contractor by their employer,  but is told what to do. has no discretion over  how  to conduct  the affairs of  the business,  and whose compensation is fixed and set by  the employer,  it  is our duty as Members of  Congress  to protect  this employee’s  rights  under Federal law.  There are millions of workers, who mow  lawns, drive trucks, work in garment linen factories, and serve  food  in  restaurants  that  I  would  consider an employee; nonetheless,  these hardworking  individuals are exploited  and misclassified by their employers seeking  to evade paying taxes. If any American worker  is told what to do, when to do it, how much  money they are going to make, what the work  rules are, what  they can and cannot do by  their employer  then  the  law should  require  they be classified as an employee and receive  all of the benefits of the 40-hour work week,  as well as worker safety protections, pension  and healthcare protections and other worker  protections provided  to  them under Federal  law.  I encourage everyone  to  join me, my cosponsoring colleagues, as well as  the AFL–  CIO. Change  to Win, United Brotherhood of  Carpenters,  International  Brotherhood  of  Teamsters, the Laborers International, UNITE  HERE, the National Employment Law Project,  and others and support EMPA to protect workers across  the country  from employers who  are only interested in making a profit for themselves at the expense of the American workers and taxpayer.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON.

A celebration is planned for May 22 to recognize her  work and contributions to Flint area youth.  Connie Rau’s work with  the  community  began  long before Flint Community Schools  employed her. From 1975 to 1985 she was a  senior therapist with the substance abuse program at Flint Osteopathic Hospital. She became a program manager at  Insight Outpatient Chemical Dependency Clinic and then  became the director of Children and Adolescent Services with the Genesee County Commission on Substance Abuse Services. It was  during  this  time  that Connie also started  to  write a column  in  the Flint Journal entitled  ‘‘Considering Kids’’ and she was an instructor  at Mott Community College. She also was an  intern field supervisor for several area universities.  As  a member  of  the  Flint Community  Schools Youth Projects staff, Connie has had  tremendous  impact on  the children of Flint.  She was  instrumental  in organizing several  programs that directly benefited the most vulnerable children  in  the Flint school system.  She coordinates two intervention programs for  the Genesee County Family Court, the Youth  Projects Diversion and the Youth Projects Diversion—Attendance Court. She established  the ‘‘Roast and Toast’’ fundraiser for student  activities, She established the ‘‘Shoes that Fit’’  Flint Chapter,  the Language Exchange program, and  the Teen Female Expo.

Brian  served the Port District for 34 years, managing  Santa Cruz Harbor, as well as the Santa Cruz  Port.  After  graduating  from  the University  of  Southern California in 1964, Brian spent the  next 22 years serving as a pilot for the United  States Coast Guard, and as a Lieutenant  Colonel Combat Rescue Pilot for the California  Air National Guard Rescue. During his  time  working as a rescue pilot. Brian earned two air  medals and one Coast Guard Commendation  medal.  In 1977, Brian ended his career as a pilot,  and moved  to  Santa Cruz  to work  as  Harbormaster for the Santa Cruz Port District.  Brian’s upbeat attitude and  friendliness with  coworkers gained him many  friends, and 2  years later, Foss worked his way up to Port  Director for the Santa Cruz Port District. For  the next 31 years, Foss continued his tenure  as Port Director, serving as the Chief Executive Officer for the District.  Outside of work, Brian was, and still is, a  passionate and active  supporter of ocean  preservation. Brian was the former Chairman  of the California Marine Affairs and Navigation  Conference, a 35-year-old California port and  harbor advocacy association. Today, he is a  member of  the Bay Planning Coalition,  the  California Marine Parks and Harbors Association, and he  is a harbor  representative  for  Santa Cruz County Inter-Agency Task Force  on economic development  relevant  to  the  Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.  But Brian’s enthusiasm is not limited to the  oceans, but extends into his personal life as  well. As a devoted father, Brian founded the  129th for Kids fund, a benefit program for military children who have lost parents in service.  His dedication to the harbor and passion for  life also extended to his employees. His coworkers described him as a fun, considerate,  and polite guy to hang around, who made a  difference  in  the  lives of others; he always  made sure to let everyone feel welcome and  to have a say in decisions. Additionally, Brian  taught many of his workers how to effectively  work in public service, and always made sure  to try to do the right thing for everyone.  Madam Speaker, I would like to extend our  Nation’s deep gratitude for Brian’s service to  the United States and his local community. I  know I speak for every Member of Congress  in expressing my bittersweet feelings towards  his  retirement, and our  thankfulness  for his  contributions to our Nation. Though Brian Foss  may be  retiring, he will not be  leaving  the  hearts of all whom he has touched.  f  HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE  OF MR. ROD COOK  HON. THADDEUS G.

The Exeter Ambulance Association was  formed 40 years ago  to provide outstanding  emergency  ambulance  service  for  Exeter  Township and St. Lawrence, Pennsylvania.  The group was formed as a non-profit organization and started as an all-volunteer service.  Over the years, it has grown and expanded its  services and now provides Advanced Life  Support (ALS), Basic Life Support (BLS), and  other emergency and non-emergency ambulance services. In addition, the Exeter Ambulance Association operates a community training center and,  in 2007,  trained over 2500  people  in  CPR  and  put  30  Automatic  Defibrillators (AEDs) into service in the community. Today, the Association employs over  50 medical transportation professionals, operates  four ambulances,  two wheelchair-vans,  and responds to over 4,000 calls for help each  year.  Its mission is ‘‘to provide quality pre-hospital  emergency medical care  in both emergency  and non-emergency settings, and perform all  services related to emergency medical service  and  emergency management.’’ As  anyone  who has received assistance from the Exeter  Ambulance Association will tell you, it has performed  its mission  in an exemplary  fashion  and consistently surpasses its own standards.  At the 40th year celebration on May 31, the  Association will be joined by representatives of  the Exeter Police K–9 unit, Drive 25-Stay Alive  program, Reiffton and Stonersville Fire Departments, The PennStar Helicopter and  flight  team, Berks County Humane Society, American Red Cross and Aquabilities of Birdsboro,  PA.

I am requesting funding in  the FY09 Defense Authorization bill, Navy Procurement account  for  the Gateway System  manufactured by Ocean Design, Inc., located  at 1026 North Williamson Boulevard in Daytona Beach, Florida 32114.  The $3 million authorized in the Navy’s Procurement budget is to provide funding to the  Navy for the purchase of the Gateway System  that has been under development by the Navy  to provide a fixed surveillance system in meeting the Nation’s Maritime Domain Awareness  security  requirements. This  is  the  first year  procurement money will be used to fund this  project. There will be no cost share, as this  project will benefit the United States Navy.  The U.S. Navy has a requirement to defend  the maritime approaches to the United States  and monitor the littorals as articulated in the  Navy’s 2006 National Strategy  for Maritime  Security. The Gateway System is an open architecture system that allowed for sensors to  be connected covertly  to monitor activity on  the ocean floor, from the ocean floor to the  surface of the water, and above the water to  provide awareness of all activity  to counter  mines, submarines, water traffic, and terrorism  that may pose a threat to the fleet and to the  United States.  f  CONGRATULATING  KTVK–TV  ON  RECEIVING THE 2008 SERVICE TO  AMERICA PARTNERSHIP AWARD  HON.

271,,110,-0.543,46,2008-05-23,Mr. ELLISON.," Madam Speaker , I rise today  to pay tribute to two of my constituents including one of  the most  remarkable women  I  know—and  the extraordinary  things she has  done and continues  to do. Koryne Kaneski  Horbal of Columbia Heights, Minnesota, is a  tireless force for equality who defines the word  trailblazer.  She has served as Chairwoman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party,  founder of the DFL Feminist Caucus, and a  Member of the Minnesota Democratic National  Committee  (DNC) where  she  started  the  DNC’s Women’s Caucus. President  Jimmy  Carter named her Ambassador to the United  Nations Commission on the Status of Women  where she served for four years. During that  time she, and noted author and feminist, Gloria Steinem, became good friends and have  since worked  together  on many  projects.  Koryne has been a contributing writer to MS.  Magazine, and now serves as a consultant to  Augsburg College, in Minneapolis. In recognition of Koryne’s contribution to society, Augsburg College established  the Koryne Horbal  Lecture Series  to continue opening  the windows of opportunity  for young women and  men  that  reflect Koryne’s commitment  to a  gender equal society. Fittingly, next month  Koryne Horbal will receive a  ‘‘Humane With  Respect’’ honorary college degree from Augsburg College that she didn’t have the opportunity to acquire in her younger years.  Koryne  is a  loyal and dear  friend—and a  loving grandmother. If you asked Koryne, of all  her renowned accomplishments; all  the barriers she’s broken down; all the glass ceilings  she’s shattered; all  the myths she’s proven  wrong; what she is most proud of? Undoubtedly, and without hesitation, she would say  loving grandmother—to a young man named  Bryce Horbal whom she has raised since infancy. Bryce is a 13 year old honors student  at Columbia Heights Middle School in my district. This young man, who  towers over his  grandmother at over 6 feet, reflects the values  that have shaped his young  life—instilled  in  him with a nurturing and loving hand by his  grandmother. Almost  three years ago,  this  young man wrote a poem that shows us why  the accolades and accomplishments Koryne  has achieved pale in comparison to the grandson she has raised. Bryce Horbal is a young  man of whom much will be expected.

272,Senate,110,-0.309,5,2008-06-06,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, the Constitution places the power of the purse  squarely in the hands of Congress. The  Lieberman-Warner  climate  security  bill and the Boxer substitute to  it,  however, thwart the Constitution and  longstanding  tradition  by  shifting  much spending power to the executive  branch. In order to protect Congress’s  constitutional role to make spending  decisions, I have introduced an amendment, cosponsored by Senators MURRAY, DORGAN, LEAHY, DURBIN, FEINSTEIN, and MIKULSKI.  Enacting this climate change legislation  in  its current  form would vest  unelected executive branch boards and  agencies with unprecedented discretion  on Federal spending in excess of more  than $1.4 trillion in new and existing  Federal programs over a span of 38  years.  Rather than Congress making decisions on funding and conducting oversight of Federal programs as intended  by the Constitution, much of these responsibilities would be in the hands of  the executive branch agencies.  In one specific case, the burden would  be  on  Congress  to  stop  executive  branch decisions on Federal spending  related to climate change initiatives.  The Climate Change Technology Board  would simply have to notify congressional committees 60 days in advance  of a funding distribution for a range of  energy  technology  programs.  The  money would be spent unless Congress  could pass a law, signed by the President, to stop it. Effectively, the Senate  could only stop the spending if it could  muster 67 votes.  The  legislation would  not  expire  until 2050, meaning that the executive  branch would go unchecked on spending decisions related to climate change  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:44 Sep 14, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD08\RECFILES\S06JN8.REC S06JN8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008
273,Senate,110,-0.3,19,2008-06-06,Mr. CASEY.," Mr. President, I rise for  two purposes. One is to speak for a couple minutes about today’s anniversary  of D-day and then also to talk about a  Pennsylvanian who lost his life in Iraq  and was this week awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. I, first, wish  to speak about D-day.  We observe this anniversary today, 64  years, but we have  to  think  today  about how we do that. We know what  happened on D-day. For so many Americans, prior to just a number of years  ago, it was a piece of history we read  about in the history books. We learned  a bit about it in school, but for a new  generation of Americans, D-day has  meant what we saw in the movie ‘‘Saving Private Ryan.’’ Thank goodness for  that film because it captured so much  of the horror, so much of the sacrifice  and the valor of our troops.  So we  remember  those Americans  who gave their lives that day to save  the world—literally to save the world  from the horror that could have befallen the world if the axis powers were  successful, and if D-day did not go as  well as it did, they might have been  successful.  I am remembering today not just a  generation of Americans, the ‘‘greatest  generation’’ of Americans as we know  them now, who sacrificed so much, but  I am thinking of people from my home  State. I think Pennsylvania had more  Medal of Honor winners in World War  II than any other State. One of them  was  in my home area, Lackawanna  County, Geno Merli, who served in Europe, in that theater of the war, and  was awarded the Congressional Medal  of Honor and passed away a couple of  years ago. So when I think of D-day,  and I think of those sacrifices, I am  thinking of heroes such as Geno Merli  and so many others who gave the ultimate sacrifice. His Medal of Honor pertained to his combat not on D-day but  in a related theater of war.  We  think  about  those who  came  back. We think about those who served  and came back, many of them wounded  permanently and irreparably, just as  we see today with some of our troops in  Iraq, and it brings to mind Abraham  Lincoln’s words in two contexts. One is  the context of those who have served.  He talked about the soldier—him who  has borne the battle—that we must  care for him who has borne the battle.  And I think one way to honor those  who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan  or around the world or in wars like  World War II is to remember something  my father said years ago when he was  serving as Governor of Pennsylvania,  and he talked about praying for our  troops, as important as that is, but he  also  talked about praying  for ourselves; that we may be worthy of their  valor.  I believe the only way we can be worthy of the valor of those who served in  World War II on D-day or served in Iraq  or Afghanistan or anywhere around the  world—in Vietnam, in the Korean War,  whatever the conflict was—we can’t  just honor them by remembering and  commemorating and talking about battles and all of the information that we  can impart about war. We have to, if  we are going to be worthy of their  valor, do the right thing today, not  just when we commemorate D-day but  every day.  There are at least two things we can  do to pay tribute to those who served  and to be worthy of their valor. One  way is to make sure those who survive  a war and come back to the United  States have not just some health care  but the best health care. And we have  to fund it. Fortunately, in the last two  budgets we have been doing that. We  have been meeting or exceeding the  budget on veterans health care.  The second thing we must do, at the  very least, is make sure anyone who  serves in combat has an opportunity to  be educated as best we can provide.  That is why the vote on the GI bill recently was so essential, so central to  meeting that basic obligation, so caring,  as Abraham Lincoln  said,  for  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:44 Sep 14, 2008 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD08\RECFILES\S06JN8.REC S06JN8 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2008
274,Senate,110,0.415,33,2008-06-06,Mr. ROBERTS.," Mr. President, I wish  today to recognize the Naval Junior  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps,  NJROTC, of Shawnee Mission North  High School in Overland Park, KS, for  their outstanding performance in the  2008 NJROTC Nationals competition.  For 3 consecutive years, the Shawnee  Mission North NJROTC,  under  the  leadership and guidance of Chief Warrant Officer  4 Dennis C. Grayless,  USMC  (Ret) and Chief Petty Officer  Christopher W. Neven, USN (Ret), has  qualified to compete in the prestigious  NJROTC National Academic, Athletic  and Drill Championship hosted by the  Navy League of the United States at  the Pensacola Naval Air Station, Pensacola, FL. The NJROTC Nationals, or  ‘‘Navy Nationals’’ as  it  is affectionately referred to by the participants, is  the most comprehensive test of overall  JROTC training and performance in existence  today. The Nation’s  finest  NJROTC units  from each of the 11  Navy Areas participate in this two-day  academic, athletic, and drill competition.  There  is  no  competition  in  JROTC  that provides a more  comprehensive test of program quality.  Earlier this year, the Shawnee Mission North team was recognized as the  Area 9 Most Outstanding Unit after  sweeping the NJROTC Area 9 Championship Drill Team Competition. The  team placed first in armed exhibition,  unarmed exhibition, armed regulation,  unarmed  regulation,  push-ups,  curl-  ups/sit-ups and in the 16 x 100 shuttle  relay. While they placed second in the  competition for Color Guard, 8 x 200  oval relay, academics, and personnel  inspection. As 2008 Area 9 Regional  Champion, the team qualified to return  to the Navy Nationals for the third  consecutive year.  At the 2008 national competition, the  Shawnee Mission North team placed  first in the Nation in the Armed Regulation Drill and finished seventh in the  overall  competition.  Cadet  Dylan  Warnick received individual honors by  finishing third  in the Nation  in the  male  curl-up/sit-up  competition  by  completing 320 cadenced curl-ups/sit-  ups  in  5 minutes.  Cadet Bethany  Krzesinski received individual honors  by finishing sixth in the Nation in the  female curl-up/sit up competition by  completing 268 cadenced curl-ups/sit-  ups in 5 minutes. While Cadet Michael  Hoffman received individual honors by  tying for fifth in the Nation in the  male  push-up  competition  by  completing 114 cadenced push-ups in 5 minutes.  As reflected in the success achieved  by  the  Shawnee  Mission  North  NJROTC  unit,  it  is  apparent  the  breadth  and  depth  of  commitment,  dedication, hard work, resolve and motivation each member of this team possesses. The Shawnee Mission North  NJROTC unit has been recognized as a  Naval Honor Unit (1992–1999), a Naval  Distinguished Unit (2000, 2007, 2008), recipient of the Unit Achievement Award  (2003), a Chief of Naval Education and  Training Unit (1988, 1989), the 2007 National Academic, Athletic and Drill  Champions, and the 2008 Area 9 Most  Outstanding Unit. Five of  its graduating cadets have enlisted into the  U.S. Armed Forces;  one  has  been  awarded an NROTC scholarship to attend Purdue University; and two cadets  from the junior class have been accepted into the 2008 summer semester at  the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis,  MD.  Mr. President, I ask my distinguished  colleagues in the Senate to join me in  recognizing  and  congratulating  the  Shawnee Mission North Naval Junior  Reserve Officer Training Corps 2008 National Championship Team: Sara Atwood, Michael Barr, Jessie Biggs, Andrew  Boyce, Amiee  Busch, Robert  Byrd,  Matthew  Carlyon,  Bryan  Chapple, Faith Cole, Amanda Fuller,  Tyler Gearin, Darrell Hayes, Joshua  Hoffman, Michael  Hoffman,  Alisyn  Katsantones, Stacey Kennedy, Bethany  Krzesinski,  Lauren  Lawson, Megan  Lawson,  Shelby  McIntosh,  Justin  Manford,  Kyle Middaugh,  Timothy  Oehlert, Philip Park, Brandon Patrick,  Aaron Patterson, Jeremy Payne, Jersey Payne, Devin Root, Niklas Rueter,  Djourdan  Stephens,  Aliana  Swiercinsky,  Brandon Ware, Dylan  Warnick, Gregory Wynn, and Rachel  Yearsley.∑  sary of the Allied Powers’ invasion of  Normandy, to pay tribute to Henry and  Homer Montgomery, two brothers who  answered their Nation’s call to duty.  These brothers, like so many of their  peers, gave up the comforts of home to  go to an unfamiliar land to fight in defense of our Nation.  Henry Montgomery, now 92, hit the  beach at Normandy on June 7, 1944. He  served in the European theater as an  artilleryman and motorcycle courier,  walking much of the way between Normandy and Berlin. This  journey of  nearly 1,000 miles was so arduous that  when he arrived in Berlin, he was medically discharged and returned to our  shores on a hospital ship.  Homer Montgomery, now 82, served  in the Pacific theater toward the end of  World War II halfway around the world  from his brother. He was a Military Police officer who served through the end  of the war.  The contributions made by these two  brothers are an excellent example of  the sacrifices made by our greatest  generation. They were able to see our  nation and our allies emerge from the  war victorious and return home unlike  so many of their brothers  in arms.  Their commitment to this struggle and  that of their comrades was critical to  securing our liberties, and our nation  is forever indebted to them.  And so, Mr. President I am honored  to pay  tribute  to  these  two great  American patriots. May they greatly  enjoy the freedom they have secured  for all of us.∑  f  MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE  At 11:26 a.m., a message  from the  House of Representatives, delivered by  Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the  following bills, in which it requests the  concurrence of the Senate:  H.R. 3021.

275,Senate,110,-0.328,13,2008-06-16,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. President. I must  say I am puzzled why a Republican minority voted last week to prevent the  Senate  from even proceeding to the  consideration of a bill—H.R. 6049, the  Energy Independence and Tax Relief  Act of 2008—designed to bring down  sky-high oil and gasoline prices, promote clean and renewable energy, create good jobs here in America, and put  our Nation on a path to energy security. I am equally puzzled at the opposition to the provisions being paid for  by closing a tax loophole on offshore  income made by hedge fund managers.  The American people need our help and  we have a bill that would provide much  needed relief to American families and  yet we can’t even get enough votes to  legislate on the bill.  The price of crude oil on the spot  market is approaching $140 per barrel,  nearly double the price of 1 year ago.  When President Bush took office, a gallon of regular gas cost $1.46 and a gallon of diesel  fuel cost $1.53. Today,  those prices are at all-time highs, with  regular gas costing $4.02 per gallon and  diesel fuel costing $4.77 per gallon. A  new poll indicates that 60 percent of  Americans are reducing spending on  other priorities because of rising gas  prices. One-half of all households with  incomes below $20,000 say they face severe hardships because of soaring gas  prices. Clearly, the status quo is intolerable, but the minority won’t even let  the Senate consider bills to address  these problems, much less pass them.  As I said, I find that puzzling. Generally speaking, the legislative process  works best when we are actually legislating.  Last week, the Senate fell 10 votes  short of invoking cloture on the motion  to proceed  to H.R.  6049.  I am  pleased to see that we are going to try  again to invoke cloture; I hope we prevail  this  time.  In addition  to promoting our Nation’s energy security,  this bill provides critical tax relief for  families and businesses, which is why I  am a cosponsor of substitute amendment Senator BAUCUShopes to offer to  this bill if we can get to it.  The Energy  Independence and Tax  Relief Act of  2008 provides approximately $18 billion in tax incentives for  investment  in renewable energy, energy efficiency and conservation, carbon capture and  sequestration demonstration projects. One provision of  the bill specifically authorizes $2 billion  for new clean renewable energy  bonds. These bonds are essential  in  helping finance facilities that generate  electricity from alternative resources  like:  wind,  small  irrigation,  geothermal, hydropower, and landfill gas  or trash combustion facilities.  The bill also provides tax credits for  renewable energy production, solar energy and fuel cell investment and tax  credits for energy-efficient commercial  buildings. Buildings account for over  one-third of America’s consumption, 49  percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, 25  percent of nitrous oxide emissions, and  10 percent of particulate emissions, all  of which damage urban air quality.  They also produce 38 percent of the  country’s carbon dioxide emissions—  the chief pollutant blamed for climate  change. By changing the way buildings  operate, we can change our  ‘‘carbon  footprint’’ on the Earth.  In addition to helping companies explore the use of alternative fuels and  energy saving products, we must also  act individually. Recognizing this, Senator BAUCUS’s legislation also provides  incentives  for  individual  taxpayers.  The bill incorporates tax credits for energy efficient appliances in homes and  energy efficient improvements to existing and new homes. If  just 1  in 10  homes used ENERGY STAR-qualified  appliances, a  joint program between  the U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy, the effect would be like planting  1.7 million new acres of trees. Additionally, by making homes more energy efficient, we generate less air pollution  and reduce high energy bills. Most of  the energy used  in our homes often  comes from the burning of fossil fuels  at powerplants, which contributes to  acid rain and smog. By improving your  home, whether by the appliances you  choose or energy efficient remodeling,  you take an important step forward in  protecting the environment.  The bottom line is that we have to  conserve oil by using  it more efficiently, and we have to find domestic  alternatives to oil. The benefit of doing  that, in addition to bolstering national  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:35 Jun 17, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G16JN6.021 S16JNPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2008

But what frightens us most is those people who spend  way too much energy and way too  much time trying to do harm to innocent Americans as they go about their  day-to-day  lives, carrying their children to piano recitals, to Little League  practice, just going to work. It just  makes common sense that we would  want to know what they were trying to  do, because if we know, we have at  least a chance to stop it.  This  is a bipartisan bill  that we  should have had a year ago. We certainly should have had 4 months ago.  Thank goodness we have it today. The  only unfortunate thing is those who  will benefit the most will never know  it, because they never became victims  because we were able to stop those terrorist acts before they took place.

278,House,110,-0.376,34,2008-06-20,Mr. LANGEVIN.," Madam Speaker, I  rise in support of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. Though not a perfect  piece of legislation, it is clearly far  better than what we have today, and  addresses a number of the many concerns that were raised about the administration’s conduct of surveillance  in this country.  As a member of  the  Intelligence  Committee, I know that we must give  our Intelligence Community the proper  tools to protect us, while upholding the  civil  liberties of Americans. Today’s  compromise  illustrates  what  this  House can do when it deliberates with  care,  holds  steady  against  fear  mongering and acts in the best interests of the country and its citizens.  This bill is strong on civil liberties,  and  includes protections against  infringement of our constitutional right  to privacy.  First, the bill clarifies that FISA is  the exclusive means by which the executive branch may conduct electronic  surveillance on U.S. soil. No President  will have the power to do an end-run  around the legal requirements of FISA.  This provision will prevent the types of  abuses we’ve witnessed under this administration.  Second, this act requires a warrant  from the FISA court to conduct surveillance of Americans abroad. Americans will no  longer  leave their constitutional protections at home when  working, studying or traveling abroad.  Third, it requires prior approval by  the FISA court of procedures the government will use when carrying out  foreign  electronic  surveillance. This  will ensure that the government’s efforts are not aimed at targeting Americans, the so-called reverse targeting  that we’re all concerned about; and  that if an American’s communications  is inadvertently intercepted, it is dealt  with in a manner that guarantees legal  protections.  It also requires and allows for, now,  an IG investigation of this warrantless  surveillance program that took place  prior to Congress being made aware of  this legislation.  ",2008

But I would like too, if you  will, react to something that was said  on the other side that just simply isn’t  true.  Yes, during J. Edgar Hoover’s day,  there was warrantless  surveillance,  even on political enemies of the people  who were President at the time. Those  days are behind us.

280,House,110,-0.319,41,2008-06-20,Mr. HALL of New York.," I have consistently  supported modernizing the existing FISA law  to give our Government the tools it needs to  identify and defeat terrorists in today’s high-  tech world, while at the same time preserving  the freedoms and rights that define America. I  have voted three times to pass legislation that  would strengthen and modernize FISA and reaffirm the rule of law. Despite some improvements over previous attempts to update FISA,  the bill considered by the House today regrettably falls short of achieving that critical balance. The rule of law lies at the core of America’s founding principles, and the language in  this bill was  too weak  to ensue  that any  breach of our  laws  that may have occurred  under the warrantless wiretapping program will  be  fully addressed.  It  is not appropriate  to  deny Americans the right to pursue these matters in court, or to short-circuit the judicial review  that  lies at  the heart of our system of  checks and balances, which is the bedrock of  our Constitution. Accordingly, I voted against  this bill.  ",2008
281,House,110,-0.509,41,2008-06-20,Mr. NADLER.," Madam Speaker, Members of  the House must decide today whether to uphold the rule of low and the supremacy of the  Constitution or whether to protect and reward  the lawless behavior of the administration and  of the telecommunications companies that participated in its clearly illegal program of spying  on innocent Americans.  This bill limits the courts hearing lawsuits alleging  illegal wiretapping  to  consider  only  whether  the  telecom companies  received a  ‘‘written  request or directive  . . .  indicating  that  the activity was  [  ] authorized by  the  President; and [ ] determined to be lawful’’—  not whether the request was actually lawful or  whether the telecom companies knew that it  was unlawful.  The bill is a fig-leaf, granting blanket immunity to the telecom companies for illegal acts  without allowing  the courts  to consider  the  facts or the law. It denies people whose rights  were violated their fair day in court, and it denies the American people their right to have  the actions of the administration subjected to  fair and independent scrutiny.  Even the courts’ limited review will remain  secret. The lawsuits will be dismissed, but the  basis  for  the dismissal—that  the defendants  were  innocent of misconduct, or  that  they  were guilty but Congress commands their immunity—must remain secret.  And  the constitutionality of  the  immunity  granted by  this bill  is very questionable. As  Judge Walker put it in the AT&T case:  AT&T’s alleged actions here violate the  constitutional rights clearly established in  [the] Keith decision. Moreover, because ‘the  very action in question has previously been  held unlawful,’ AT&T cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position  could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal.  in  I rise  I would hope that the courts will find that,  because the Constitutional rights of Americans  have been violated, Congress’ attempt to prevent court review is unconstitutional.  The bill also reiterates than FISA and specified other statutes are the exclusive legal authority for electronic surveillance. The Act has  always said  that. This bill adds some new  mechanisms to ensure that any future legislation may not be read to override this exclusivity by implication, but only by explicitly saying that that is its purpose.  No one and no court should draw the false  conclusion that we are thereby implying that  the exclusivity provision was, or could have  been, overridden either by  the President’s  claim of inherent authority under Article II of  the Constitution, or by the Authorization for the  Use of Military Force of 2001. This bill does  not say or imply that. If there is any doubt of  this point, the blanket immunity provisions of  this bill reflect Congress’ understanding  that  this domestic spying was not legal. If it were,  there would not be any necessity  for  these  provisions.  This bill abandons the Constitution’s protections and insulates lawless behavior from legal  scrutiny.  I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.

282,House,110,-0.238,41,2008-06-20,Mr. BOSWELL.," Madam Speaker,  support of H.R. 6304.  This is the kind of work I came to Congress  hoping for—bipartisan legislation that protects  our security and our liberty. It’s a solid compromise that does what it needs to do for the  country.  One of my specific concerns in FISA reform  over the last year has been finding a way to  protect reasonable private companies, who assisted government out of patriotism.  This bill does that. It doesn’t give anyone a  free pass, but it allows companies to come before the courts and make their case in order  to be protected from lawsuits.  That’s a good result, and I thank Chairman  REYES for his work in reaching this reasonable  bipartisan compromise.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’  Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE  of  Florida.  Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  in support of  H.R. 6304, a bill to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  and  to  protect  America from foreign threats.  For the past several months, I have heard  from hundreds of constituents on the issue of  FISA.  Each one of  them expressed  their alarm  and disbelief that the House Majority would repeatedly refuse  to call a vote on bipartisan  legislation  to extend FISA and address our  grave vulnerability to terrorist attacks.  Today I am pleased that the Majority leadership has finally reached across the aisle to put  together a compromise bill, and fulfill one of its  fundamental tasks—to ensure the security of  this great Nation.  This compromise is also a reminder of what  I have always believed, that no one side can  do it alone; both parties must work together to  ensure our safety.

283,House,110,-0.35,48,2008-06-20,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, not so  many years ago two famous American  artists, Josh Stone and Dionne Warwick, created a song called, ‘‘What’s it  all about, Alfie?’’ Here is how the song  began:  ‘‘What’s it all about, Alfie?  Is it just for the moment we live?  What’s it all about when you sort it  out, Alfie?  Are we meant to take more than we  give?’’  On June 19 this week, 2008, the New  York Times lead story said quite a bit  about  taking.  The  headline  reads,  ‘‘Deals With Iraq Are Set To Bring the  Oil Giants Back.’’ I hope every American reads the lead story in the New  York Times this week, June 19, a story  written by Andrew Kramer.  Here is some of what it says. It says  Exxon Mobil, Shell, Total, and BP,  along with some other companies like  Chevron, and a number of smaller oil  companies, are in talks with Iraq’s oil  ministry for no-bid contracts, I repeat,  no-bid contracts to service Iraq’s largest fields. The no-bid contracts are unusual for the industry. Many experts  consider these contracts to be their  best hope for large-scale increases in  production over there. And it talks a  lot about the politics of global oil and  how other places like Bolivia and Venezuela  and Russia  and Kazakhstan  aren’t so friendly to the United States  anymore as we become totally dependent on imported fuel. And it says that  the biggest prize everybody is waiting  for is the development of these new oil  fields.  But of course we have to be careful  because these mother lodes are threatened by insurgents who don’t like the  fact that western companies are coveting their resources. And here we live  in a country now where gas is over $4 a  gallon. It would be so easy just to take  it. And as the song says, are we meant  to take more than we give?  Technically, these no-bid deals, more  no-bid  from this administration, are  structured  as  service  contracts. As  such, they do not require the passage  of an oil law setting out terms for competitive bidding. The  legislation has  been stalled by disputes among Shiites,  Sunni and Kurdish parties over revenue  sharing and other  conditions  inside  that country where their parliament is  in turmoil and cannot pass a hydrocarbon law. And thus, outsiders come  in and are covetous of those resources.  The whole process is designed to circumvent the  legislative stalemate. I  might say, how convenient. How convenient.  And so Americans should ponder the  connection between our dependence.  Now almost 75 percent of what people  pump into their tanks comes from resources from other places, and think  about how serious we had best be as a  country to become energy independent  here at home so we can restore our  independence  again  because  every  American family that can’t afford to  drive to work anymore or go on vacation is less free than they were a year  ago.  And the year 1998 is very important  because that is the year when America  began importing over half of what we  consume. Every year we become less  and less free.  It is really sad what is happening in  the world. I mourn for my country as  we approach  Independence Day that  she is not free. And the way we are  going to fix this is for Americans to  really understand the nature of our  predicament.  I would prefer not to send America’s  finest to wars over oil, but that is exactly what we have done. And it will  cost upwards of a trillion dollars already to pay for their deployment. It is  important to think about the words to  that song: Are we meant to take? I  really think we are meant to create.  The way this country was born out of  people’s highest ideals, to create a Nation that could be self-sustaining within its own borders without all these  interlocking, foreign entailments that  George Washington warned us about  over 200 years ago.

286,House,110,0.493,55,2008-06-20,Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland.," Mr.  Speaker, I am pleased that my colleagues  for the  last hour helped to  make the point that oil is high and  gasoline is high because there is an imbalance between supply and demand.  There are a lot of differences of opinion  as to how we got here, why we’re here  and what we ought to do to reduce the  price of gas.  The next chart is really an historical  one. This whole saga begins  in 1956  when a geologist of the Shell Oil Company gave a talk to a group of physicians on the 8th day of March in San  Antonio, Texas. And he made a prediction which was an audacious prediction then. At that time, the United  States was the king of oil. We were  producing more oil, using more oil and  exporting more oil  than any other  country in the world. Here we were in  1956. He predicted that just 14 years  later, in 1970, the United States would  reach  its maximum  oil  production.  That was sheer heresy then. Nobody  believed him. He was ridiculed. But  right on schedule, 14 years later, in  1970, the United States peaked in oil  production.  Now he was predicting this for only  the lower 48 States, which is shown  here, Texas plus the rest of the United  States. Then we found a lot of oil in  Alaska. We found some oil in the Gulf  of Mexico. And we learned more and  more how to get oil from natural gas  liquids. By 1980, looking back, you can  see, gee, M. King Hubbert was really  right, wasn’t he? We did reach maximum oil production in 1970. I’m going  to keep coming back to that.

David  is the 59th  North Carolina State Trooper to have  been killed in the line of duty.  David was only 24 years old and was  a 2-year veteran of the North Carolina  Highway Patrol. He was a native of  Sylva, NC, and a  2002 graduate of  Smoky Mountain High School where he  was a football and wrestling star.  We are all grateful for David’s dedication  to protecting  the citizens of  North Carolina. He lived in Cherokee  with his wife Michaela, who had just  given birth to their son Tye 2 weeks  ago.  David was a member of the Eastern  Band of the Cherokee Indian Tribe and  the first member of that tribe to serve  with the Highway Patrol. In addition  to being a State trooper, David volunteered as the Junior Varsity softball  coach  at  Smoky  Mountain  High  School.  Along with his wife Michaela and son  Tye, David is survived by his father,  David S. Blanton, Sr., mother, Jennifer  Blanton, and younger brother, Jesse  Blanton.  David’s friends, family, fellow troopers, and the people of North Carolina  are mourning this very tragic loss.  I know there are no words I can offer  to help comfort Michaela and other  members of the Blanton family, but I  hope my colleagues in the Senate will  join me  in  keeping  them  in  our  thoughts and prayers.  David gave his life in service to our  State,  and  this  ultimate  sacrifice  should never be forgotten.  I send my deepest condolences to all  who had the privilege of knowing this  young man who gave his life in service  to our State.  f  IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH  ENERGY PRICES  ",2008
289,Senate,110,0.509,83,2008-06-20,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President, earlier  this week, I asked Idahoans to share  with me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded  by the hundreds. The stories, now numbering over  1,000, are heartbreaking  and touching. To respect their efforts,  I am submitting every e-mail sent to  me  through  energy_prices@crapo  .senate.gov  to  the  RECORD. This is not an issue that will  be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves  immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard.  Their  stories not only detail  their  struggles to meet everyday expenses,  but also have  suggestions and  recommendations as to what Congress can  do now to tackle this problem and find  solutions that last beyond today. I ask  unanimous consent to have printed in  the RECORDtoday’s letters.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  CONGRESSIONAL  SENATORCRAPO: We are not going to be  able to take any time to enjoy our great  state of Idaho this summer as with years  past. The gas to go and return from our favorite spots like Stanley basin, Warm Lake,  McCall’s Ponderosa State Park is just too  much to make it enjoyable. The cost of food  clearly is reflective of the fuel pricing. This  just makes it far too expensive to go anywhere this summer.  I am absolutely disgusted in the way our government is allowing this to happen to the American people.  I look forward to a movement to begin re-  commissioning our own drilling rigs that  still sit idle in the Gulf of Mexico.  I look forward to a movement to begin  drilling on our own land for oil that we all  know is right under our own borders.  I look forward to a movement to release  and discontinue  the excessive  storage of  emergency fuels.  I also know that I am not alone in monitoring the existing administration who will  not lobby for these items I list to be addressed and resolved. It is time we start taking care of our own with our own resources.  This includes limiting the impacts on the  greater population by the loud concerns of a  few groups. With today’s technology we can  certainly drill and protect our environment  and begin to reduce greatly our dependence  on foreign oil(s).  Respectfully,  BILL, Boise.  DEARSENATORCRAPO: As one of those who  voted for you I am pleased to provide a bit of  input on the costs of fuel and the impact on  myself, my family, and my business.  Just like the majority of Idaho families,  our family has been directly impacted by the  very high prices of gasoline and the way it  happened  . . . so quickly and without reprieve or real alternatives.  In my business, I must have a good supply  of gasoline in order to function. I operate a  flight training school for pilots in Nampa.  My costs for fuel are always around $10,000  per year and that is normally my one major  expense associated with my business outside  of the other normal overhead costs any other  business has. Even so, it is the Numero Uno  cost for my business, and now it is about 50%  increased from that already very high price.  What compounds this loss is that so many  people have become too  financially short  that my customer base is very low now.  Normally, in the past 7 years, I would be  looking at a full student schedule, with at  least 3 or 4 on a waiting list. This year, I  have a 20% load and no waiting list. It is  that sparse due to the economy, then compounded by the very high fuel costs.  Thanks  for  the opportunity  to provide  some direct input on the subject to your office.  Sincerely yours,  GARY, Nampa.  DEARSENATOR: The biggest impact that  gas prices has had on me affects our family.  We have six married children and one single  daughter spread throughout the west. One in  Colorado Springs, CO; another in Mesa, AZ;  two in the Orem, UT, area; another in dental  school at Marquette; and two in the Boise  area. We plan a family reunion every summer, which is usually our once-a-year gathering. We have cancelled our reunion this  year, scheduled for Colorado Springs, CO, because of the cost of fuel for everyone. I just  can’t tell you how disappointing it is to all  of us not to have an opportunity to be together this year. We hope that it will not  stop us next year.  I hear all of the reports that America has  ample supplies but legislation and environmentalists prevent us from developing the  natural resources. We are too late for today,  but tomorrow will be here and we need to be  prepared to provide for ourselves. All that  you can do to make this possible is needed  and necessary. Please do your best to make  it happen.  DOUG.  PLEASE pass emergency legislation to exploit America’s natural resources. Authorize  drilling wherever oil companies think there  might be oil or natural gas, authorize nuclear energy and wind power. Set up drilling  stations off America’s shores instead of letting Cuba and China take our oil. Show some  resolve and Yankee ingenuity!  Americans will downsize and conserve—the  market will  take care of  that, but you  should have had us energy independent years  ago. We could be sending money to America  instead of supporting people who do not have  our country’s best interest at heart.

290,,110,0.547,97,2008-06-20,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.," Madam  Speaker, depending on what day  it  is,  the  House Democrat energy policy can be described one of  two ways—either  inaction or  overreaction. On  the one hand, with gas  prices over 4 dollars per gallon and a growing  global  demand  for  oil, House Democrats  refuse to lift the moratoriums against exploring  for new oil and natural gas reserves here in  the United States. On the other hand, having  now failed to lower gas prices by doing nothing, we hear Members of the majority saying  we should nationalize the American oil industry. Since when did the United States start following  the example of socialist regimes  like  that of unstable Venezuelan President Hugo  Chavez?  House Republicans have a plan that will not  surrender our freedom and innovative spirit to  the limits of big government. We want to lift  the unnecessary restrictions on energy exploration. We want to invest in alternative energy  sources and use the power of the free market  to drive innovation forward and energy prices  down.  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we  will never forget September 11th. I am grateful  that World War II veteran, Sergeant William E.  Durkes, Sr., is visiting Washington today continuing to celebrate his 92nd birthday.  f  TRIBUTE TO MRS. LINDA DAVIS  HON. DANNY K.

It is my privilege to honor Reeve who has worked to better  himself and his community.  The Congressional Award recognizes initiative, achievement, and service in young people. Reeve exemplifies all of these qualities.  The award’s recipients represent the best of  America—they are committed to self-improvement, hard work, and community service.  Reeve performed over 400 hours of community service, managing the snack shack at his  town’s athletic  fields. The profits he earned  selling concessions went  to  fund  the  town’s  youth soccer program. Reeve also volunteered  as a teacher’s aide at the Groton Children’s  Center.  In addition to helping his community, Reeve  set personal development goals. He received  certification to become a soccer referee and  subsequently worked as an official for youth  games in his town. To complete the physical  fitness  goal, Reeve  played  for  his  high  school’s varsity tennis team, and for his expedition requirement, Reeve explored the coast  of southern Maine.  It  is also  important  to acknowledge  that  Reeve and the other extraordinary young people receiving  the Congressional Award were  not alone in their work to achieve their goals.  Along the way, they were guided by the helping hands of parents, teachers, and mentors,  who provided constant encouragement and  support.  Today, I honor Reeve’s hard work and dedication. His dedication  to community service  and personal development should be admired  and emulated.  f  HONORING SAINT JAMES PARISH  HON. DALE E.

292,,110,0.282,104,2008-06-20,Mr. DAVIS of Virginia.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  recognize  COL  Brian W.  Lauritzen, the Installation Commander at Fort  Belvoir, Virginia. As a Member of Congress  who represents Fort Belvoir, I know firsthand  that Colonel Lauritzen has served with great  competence,  tireless determination and constant communication with the community during a time of great transition for his installation.  Colonel Lauritzen  took command of Fort  Belvoir, one of our Nation’s largest and most  diverse military installations, in July 2005 with  major challenges awaiting him and even more  on the horizon. Fort Belvoir was already engaged in master planning for redevelopment to  expand the number of Department of Defense  tenants and stretch  the  functions of  the already  busy  installation. Then,  just  a  few  months  into his  tenure,  the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission’s  final  recommendations doubled  the size of  Fort Belvoir’s incoming workforce by 2011.  The BRAC changes at Fort Belvoir, among  the most substantial of BRAC 2005’s mandates, will transform the installation into. the  major support center  for  the Nation’s most  senior military leadership. Ensuring a successful transition has brought with it the great challenges of working with both the Department of  Defense and the local community. These challenges  include  timely and  transparent planning, assessing the environmental and societal  impacts of absorbing more than 19,000 new  employees, managing the transportation infrastructure in an area already burdened by traffic, and ensuring that all of Fort Belvoir’s defense tenants can still perform their vital national security missions.  Colonel  Lauritzen  has  ably met  these  daunting challenges with  the superb attitude  that,  in order  to be successful, Fort Belvoir  must continue to be receptive and responsive  to the concerns of all of the surrounding communities. His early promise to the community  that there would be ‘‘no daylight between us’’  has held  true. Colonel Lauritzen established  the BRAC Board of Advisors, a first-in-the-nation group bringing together members of the  Army,  incoming agencies, and  the  region’s  elected officials and  local civic activists  to  identify development  issues and keep open  the lines of communication.  I have always found Colonel Lauritzen to be  the consummate consensus builder. He personally has made more than 150 appearances  and presentations before community groups to  keep them apprised of the BRAC expansion,  Fort Belvoir’s other missions, and their impact  on  the community. Similarly, he built strong  communication coalitions with and between  the major commands headquartered at Fort  Belvoir  in support of  their people and  their  global missions through the Installation Senior  Leadership Council.  More  than  just  communication, Colonel  Lauritzen continues to facilitate progress, even  when progress is difficult. He worked directly  with Fairfax and Prince William Counties, the  Virginia Department of Transportation, and the  Army Corps of Engineers to address some of  the many transportation challenges facing the  region. Especially noteworthy is his personal  involvement to secure an agreement to complete the extension of the Fairfax County Parkway, a vital connection across the Fort’s Engineer Proving Ground, something that had festered unresolved for more than 10 years.  Inside  the perimeter of his base, Colonel  Lauritzen has steadfastly insisted that our Nation’s Soldiers and their families deserve the  highest quality of life. Fort Belvoir has one of  the Army’s most successful Residential Community Initiative programs that has revitalized  the approach to military housing and neighborhood centers, creating first-class communities  for those who serve our Nation in uniform.  On a more personal note, Colonel Lauritzen  and his staff have eagerly addressed questions or constituent concerns  that my office  has brought to their attention. Regardless of  how complicated or  involved  these requests  may have been, I have always found his door  to be open to discuss the issues and, more  often than not, find compromise to difficult situations.  Madam Speaker, at Fort Belvoir’s Change  of Command Ceremony on Tuesday, July 2,  Colonel Lauritzen—West Point graduate, Soldier, and extraordinary officer—will retire from  the Army and enter a new chapter in his life.  I have  truly enjoyed working with him, and  wish him all the best as he pursues new endeavors. He has truly served Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and our Nation with the highest standards of leadership expected from the very best  of our military commanders.  f  SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS  ACT, 2008  SPEECHOF  HON.

293,,110,0.343,104,2008-06-20,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker, the  Michigan Department of Labor and Economic  Growth yesterday shocked Michigan when  it  released its unemployment figures. Michigan’s  unemployment rate has risen from 6.9 percent  in April to 8.5 percent in May. This is the highest rate in our State since October of 1992.  Regrettably, we are now one month away  from recording our eighth straight year of payroll job losses.  It is in this context that my constituents are  hearing  the news  that Congress  is debating  providing  additional  unemployment  benefits  which are desperately needed by  too many  working families in my State. Last week this  House passed H.R. 5749, the Emergency Extended  Unemployment  Compensation  Act,  with nearly 2⁄3of the Members of the House  voting in favor. This bill would provide an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits to  unemployed workers  in every State. Unemployed workers  in States with exceptionally  high unemployment rates, like Michigan, would  receive an additional 13 weeks of benefits beyond that. Unfortunately, the provision granting  workers in States like Michigan an additional  13 weeks of benefits, which  received very  strong bipartisan support in the House just last  week, is not included in this supplemental appropriations bill.  The unemployment benefits provision in this  supplemental  provides  just  13  additional  weeks for every State. It does not provide any  extra help  for States  that need  it  the most.  States  like Michigan where  the unemployed  are having great difficulty  finding work because there are so few jobs to be had. Workers have  little opportunity  to move  to other  areas to find work because they can’t sell their  homes, and they are having difficulty driving  far distances  to  try and  find a new  job because of the high cost of gas. Michigan, with  the worst unemployment rate  in  the Nation,  needs extra help. This supplemental does not  provide it.  I will be supporting both sections of the supplemental. It provides equipment and pay for  our troops in harm’s way and educational benefits for them when they return home. And the  level of aid to the unemployed all across the  country  is a good start. However,  I am disappointed we have not provided  the much  needed extra assistance to those who need it  most. We must continue to work to help the  chronically unemployed to get that additional  safety net that will help support countless families in Michigan.  f  RECOGNIZING THE HONORABLE  ANDREW L.

294,House,110,-0.376,6,2008-07-08,Mr. MILLER of North Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Preserve America and Save America’s  Treasures Act, which will, as the two  speakers already have said, authorize  two programs that are critical to the  future of America’s historic preservation efforts.  I want to thank Chairman RAHALL  and Ranking Member YOUNG of the  Natural Resources Committee, as well  as Chairman GRIJALVA and Ranking  Member BISHOPof the National Parks,  Forests  and  Public  Lands  Subcommittee,  for  their work  in  shepherding this legislation, as well as the  historic preservation community  for  their support for this bill.  The Save America’s Treasures Program was started as part of the White  Mr. MIKETURNER House Millennium Council chaired by  then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. The  program  has  provided much-needed  bricks and mortar support and has succeeded beyond anyone’s expectations,  funding America’s most  threatened  cultural treasures for almost 10 years.  The  current administration, under  the  leadership of First Lady Laura  Bush, created  the Preserve America  Program to support community preservation efforts by providing funding for  heritage  tourism  and  preservation  planning.  The  two programs  serve different  purposes, and together, they provide a  comprehensive approach to preservation and community revitalization.  and I announced  the Preserve America and Save America’s Treasures Act in the Sewall-Belmont House, just a couple of blocks  from here. The Sewall-Belmont House  was  designated  a  national  historic  landmark for its significance in American history. It was the headquarters  for the National Woman’s Party, led by  Alice Paul, and their movement to secure women the right to vote.  Despite that obvious historical significance, it was not long ago that the  Sewall-Belmont House was threatened  by a leaking roof and by significant  other structural damage. The Sewall-  Belmont House was the first building  to receive funding as a Save America’s  Treasures project.  In my own district, Save America’s  Treasures funding has helped preserve  the F.W. Woolworth Building in downtown Greensboro. Mr. Speaker, as you  know well, on February 1, 1960, four African American students  from North  Carolina A&T University sat down at  the ‘‘white only’’ lunch counter and refused to move until they were treated  the same as the white customers.  Within 2 months, the sit-ins at Woolworth’s  inspired  similar  demonstrations throughout the South involving  thousands of protesters. The sit-in at  the Woolworth’s lunch counter was the  moment when the civil rights struggle  in this country became a mass movement.  The Woolworth Building  and  its  lunch counter are sacred grounds of the  civil rights movement and must be preserved for future generations.  The Preserve America Program has  designated more  than  500 neighborhoods, cities, and towns throughout the  United States  as Preserve America  Communities and has awarded grants  since 2006. Earlier this year, the Department of the Interior made its first  round of 2008 grants of $2.9 million to 43  projects in 25 States. This September  they will award an additional $4.3 million  in grants. The projects support  heritage tourism, the commercial revitalization of neglected downtowns, and  the reuse of historic properties.  Mr.  Speaker,  America’s  historic  places remind us of who we are. They  remind us of our history. We cannot  cheat our children of that connection  with their past, that understanding of  who they are.

295,House,110,0.315,13,2008-07-08,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of H.R. 4199, which would expand the  Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical  Park to include additional sites associated with  the  lives and work of Wilbur and Orville  Wright.  Few  technological advances have  transformed the world or our nation’s economy, society, culture, and national character as  the  development of powered flight. Therefore, it is  important to preserve the historical sites associated  the Wright brothers’ achievements  in  the field of aviation. That is what this bill will  do.  Over the years, the Ohio congregational delegation has worked together to preserve and  promote Ohio’s  rich aviation history. A  few  years ago,  I, along with Congressman Tony  Hall, had the privilege of introducing the bill  that later became law to designate eight Miami  Valley counties and the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park as part of a National Aviation Heritage Area. Today, I commend my  colleague,  Congressman MIKE  TURNER, for his leadership in sponsoring this  bill to add two additional sites to the aviation  park.  Specifically, H.R. 4199 will add Hawthorne  Hill, which was Orville Wright’s home in Oakwood, and several Wright Factory buildings in  Dayton, where  the brothers  conducted  research and testing. These sites would be part  of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, which already includes such historic sites as: Huffman Prairie Flying Field, the  Wright Cycle Company Complex, and the Paul  Laurence Dunbar House.  Together,  these  sites are an important part to nation’s history,  and Ohio’s cultural heritage.  Again, I commend Congressman TURNER for  his leadership to preserve and promote Ohio’s  aviation heritage with  this  legislation, and  I  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 4419.

298,House,110,0.267,20,2008-07-08,Mr. TURNER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  bill designating the facility of the United States  Postal Service  located  at  101 Tallapoosa  Street in Bremen, Georgia, as the ‘‘Sergeant  Paul Saylor Post Office Building.’’  Friendly. Dedicated. Hardworking.  These  are but a  few of  the magnificent words of  praise  that arise when  friends and  family  speak of the memory of Sergeant Paul Saylor.  A native of Bremen, Georgia, Paul was a  shining star in his community. A starter on the  football  team and committed  thespian, Paul  was voted ‘‘best personality’’ by his graduating  class of 2002. After graduation, Paul attended  North Georgia College and State University, a  military college.  Tragically, on August 15, 2005, Sergeant  Saylor lost his life while serving as part of the  National  Guard’s  48th  Infantry  in  Al  Mahmudiyah, Iraq.  Described by his brother, Jamie, as  the  ‘‘. . . type who would  help  you,  but  he  wouldn’t  let you know  it,’’ Sergeant Saylor  served his family, community, and country with  selfless devotion.  I rise today in honor of not only a tremendous patriot, but an outstanding citizen. I urge  my colleagues  to support  this  resolution  in  honor of a valiant life that should not, and will  not, soon be forgotten by a grateful Nation.  I yield back the balance of our time.  ",2008
299,House,110,-0.027,27,2008-07-08,Mr. CAZAYOUX.," Madam Speaker, I  gladly join Congressman MATHESON in  our discussion  regarding a balanced  comprehensive energy policy that the  Blue  Dogs  such  as  Congressman  MATHESONand others support.  I believe that the high price of gasoline is an immediate problem that requires both swift action and long-term  planning. It is the number one issue  facing America today. It is one that  hits home every time that we fill up  our vehicles to go to work, when we attempt to go on summer vacation, and  even when we go to the store to buy  food.  I support expanding domestic drilling  in the Outer Continental Shelf and in  ANWR. This will not only reduce our  dependence on foreign oil and lower gas  prices, it will help our economy and  create jobs. In fact, in Louisiana it was  recently announced  that a new oil  lease in the Gulf of Mexico would generate $78 million for Louisiana to restore its coast.  I believe that one of the root problems of the high price of gasoline is our  outdated  refining  capacity. That  is  why I support building new and improved  refineries  and  updating  old  ones. We haven’t had a new refinery  built since 1972. We have to do a better  job at allowing companies  to build  these refineries and incentivizing companies to build refineries so that we  can expand our refinery capacity and  stop importing refined gas and refined  oil.  In addition to the issue of supplying  gas prices, a strengthening economy  and subsequently a strengthened dollar  will also go a long way to improving  fuel prices. I believe, and the experts  support this, deficit spending is one of  the root causes of our reduced dollar,  and that is playing a huge role, I believe, in the price of oil and the subsequent price of gas in our economy. If  we  can  start  spending within  our  means in Congress, we believe that the  dollar will become a stronger dollar,  we can buy more foreign oil, because  we are now importing 60 percent of our  oil, we can do that in a more effective  way and, therefore, the price of gas  should go down.  But the talk of drilling, we should  not stop there. That approach is a narrow approach. It is an approach I support, but it is not the end all. We have  to have a multi-pronged approach to  reach energy independence and security in the long term as well as the  short term. That is why we voted to increase the oil supply by temporarily diverting oil shipments from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Experts estimate this will lower gas prices anywhere from 5 cents to 24 cents, and this  just went into effect this past week and  hopefully we will see some real lowered  costs at the pump very shortly.  Also,  I  personally  voted  for  an  amendment to the Congressional Budget Resolution that would open up drilling  in ANWR and the Outer Continental Shelf.  We as a body passed the Gas Price  Relief for Consumers Act, and that allows the Justice Department to investigate foreign oil companies who conspire to drive up prices for American  consumers.  We passed the Renewable Energy and  Job Creation Act of 2008, which will  help reduce our dependence on foreign  oil by providing tax credits for renewable energy, including solar, biomass,  geothermal, hydropower, and wind. We  need to be aggressive in making sure  that we harness the technological energy of our Nation, and this bill goes a  long way in doing that.  We passed the Energy Markets Emergency Act, which directs  the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  to use all its powers, including emergency powers, to determine whether  excessive speculation in energy futures  markets is driving the price of oil up.  We passed the farm bill, which included a strong provision for biofuel  production. And we know, the experts  suggest  that, without  the  use  of  biofuels, we would see gas prices 15 percent higher than they are now.  The bottom line is we need to work  hard to create energy  independence.  That work must start today. In the  words of one of my constituents: These  cars just won’t run on hope.  So we need to act to continue to increase domestic drilling, to  increase  our  ability  to harness  our  technological energy that America has succeeded in solving most of our problems  and all of our problems in the past.  And so we need to bring relief to hardworking Americans by  reducing gas  prices now.  ",2008
300,House,110,-0.267,27,2008-07-08,Mr. MOORE of Kansas.," Madam  Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Utah, thank you for presiding here. I  want to talk for just a few moments  about this energy crisis that our country faces.  Madam Speaker, I am the policy cochair for a group called the Blue Dog  Coalition, which is using some of the  time tonight, and I appreciate my colleagues being here to discuss the energy situation in our country.  Shortly after the last election when  in fact there was a change in the majority in the House and the Democrats  took control, the cochairs of the Blue  Dog group and a group called the New  Democratic Coalition, which I also belong to; I am not  in the  leadership  there, but I have belonged to that since  I have been in Congress for my tenth  year now, we were  invited over  to  speak to the President about policy.  And this was the first time that we had  been invited over to speak about policy. We had been invited for several  other ceremonial things, but not about  policy. So I really appreciated the opportunity to talk with the President.  In fact, the four leaders of the Blue  Dog group met up in my office to talk  about some ground rules since we only  had  a  45-minute meeting with  the  President. So we talked about how long  we would take each if we had a chance  to talk at all, and we decided we would  each take about 2 minutes. And we  talked and went through our  items  there.  But when we were leaving after this  45-minute meeting, the President was  walking beside me. We were walking  out the front door of the White House,  and I said, ‘‘Mr. President, you have an  opportunity to be a hero to people in  this country and maybe a few people  around the world.’’ And he said, ‘‘Well,  how is that?’’  I said,  ‘‘Mr. President, do you remember, a little more than 30 years  ago there was a man on television one  night talking to the American people  about the long lines at the gas pumps.  He had a cardigan sweater on sitting in  front of the fireplace. His name was  Jimmy Carter.’’ And  the President  said, ‘‘I remember that.’’ I said, ‘‘Mr.  President, President Carter said what  we need is a comprehensive energy policy.’’  And, you know, President Carter was  right then, and I have faulted every  Democratic and Republican President  since President Carter for not doing  what he said we needed to do back  then, because that was the right thing.  And what  happened was President  Carter made a few recommendations to  Congress, and Congress passed a couple  little things like the solar panels tax  credit and a few other things. But a few  months after President Carter talked  to the American people, the long lines  at the gas pumps went down, and I  have said that every American adult in  this country got attention deficit disorder and forgot about what he said.  b2000  And I wish we had done that back  then, and I wish we had done that and  had concentrated on that every year  since then because we’d be in a whole  different position as a Nation on the  energy issue right now in this world.

301,House,110,0.433,34,2008-07-08,Mr. ROSKAM.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding. Thank you for the time.  I  am  absolutely  convinced, Mr.  Speaker, that this is a pivotal time in  our public life and it’s a pivotal time  that doesn’t come along very often, the  sense  of  clarity  that  has  emerged  across the country when gasoline  is  now knocking on the door of $4.50 a  gallon all across the country. Today as  I left Wheaton, Illinois, $4.17 a gallon.  As I’m out in town hall meetings, as  I’m  literally walking  in the parades  over the 4th of July, everybody is coming together and saying, look, let’s do  something about this. And rather than  having this whole opportunity just be  squandered away, we have got an opportunity to move forward. And, unfortunately, the orthodoxy that is developed on the other side of the aisle is  what my predecessor, Henry Hyde, used  to call ‘‘government by bumper sticker.’’ ‘‘Government by bumper sticker’’  says put cute  little phrases on the  backs of cars and that’s the policy that  is going to drive our country. Well,  that’s great. Bumper stickers are nice  and cute when it’s at $2.50 a gallon. But  in my district you know what people  are saying? Rip the bumper stickers off  and let’s get serious about bringing a  national policy as it relates to energy  independence for the United States of  America so that we’re not creating the  same  elements of great  risk where  right now, as you know, we are funding  both sides of the war on terror. When  we go to the gas pump and the money  that we are putting in and the taxes  that we are paying, yes, we’re protecting ourselves from terrorism. We  are protecting ourselves with homeland  security and domestic security efforts  and our whole military infrastructure.  But we are also putting money in the  hands of regimes that are hostile, that  are exporting terrorism and are being  very provocative on the world stage.  So, Mr. Speaker, we have got a  chance today in this Congress to bring  together a wide-ranging coalition that  has an interest and a desire to move  forward on energy independence, and I  think that the time is now. Part of it  has to be exploring and continuing to  unlock American resources. Part of it  has to be that. You can’t do the math.  You can’t ultimately come up with the  types of solutions that are going to  satisfy our energy needs and simply ignore the resources that are available in  the Arctic,  the  resources  that  are  available  in  the Outer Continental  Shelf. So that has got to be part of it.  Part of it is we have got to put nuclear power back  into this mix. We  have had great obstacles in the past as  it relates to nuclear energy. Look at  France. They have done a tremendous  job harnessing that energy, moving it  in ways that don’t have the same types  of emissions problems that other elements do. Nuclear energy has to be a  part of it.  The types of funding resources that  would be available if we were to unlock  those American resources that I talked  about a minute ago could fund many of  the R and D types of projects. Let me  tell you about one in my district. I represent an  institution called the Gas  Technology  Institute, GTI,  in Des  Plaines, Illinois. It’s a wonderful program,  a  public/private  partnership.  They are the types of folks that are  doing the R and D that  looks  into  emerging technologies, and then they  help hand that off to industry and applied science. They have got a technology that they are on the verge of  that is an anti-idling technology. So  here’s what happens: If you’re a commercial truck, if you’re a commercial  bus, they waste tremendous energy as  they are idling, as they are at stoplights and moving and not moving in  traffic. Well, the technology that GTI  is developing moves this so that in a  nutshell it’s a solid-fuel oxide that literally saves us in terms of the amount  of energy that’s used, the emissions  that are emitted. It’s that type of R  and D that can undergird the types of  things that the gentleman from Georgia has been talking about, Mr. Speaker.  There is a whole host of opportunities here, and it’s dynamic. The public  knows it. The public is crying out for  what? The public is crying out for this  body to act, for this body to get over  the nonsense of ‘‘government by bumper sticker,’’ and to say, look, we can all  come together. And we can get 218  Members, a majority of this House, to  come  together around  commonsense  ideas that strive for American energy  independence. The gentleman from Illinois my colleague Mr. SHIMKUS has  been a table pounder  for clean coal  technology. That can transform not  only our region of the country in being  an exporter, but it can literally transform how the United States begins to  look in the future. So the opportunities  are there.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I’m very hopeful about what can come  out of this. But it only comes out if  there is a political will that develops  that says we are going to put 218 votes  up on that board and we’re going to  move the ball for the American public.  ",2008
302,Senate,110,0.782,55,2008-07-08,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President,  232  years ago the Declaration of Independence established that humans have the  right  to  self-government because of  their unalienable rights to life, liberty  and  the  pursuit  of happiness. Preserving these principles requires the  same wisdom, courage and spirit of sacrifice  that  characterized many  18th  century Americans.  ‘‘What will our children say,’’ wrote  Boston attorney Josiah Quincy II in  1768, ‘‘When they read the history of  these times, should they find we tamely gave away, without one noble struggle,  the most  invaluable of earthly  blessings? . . . let us . . . swear we will  die, if we cannot live freemen!’’  Indeed, the Americans chose to fight  nobly and courageously. After the British surrender at the Battle of Saratoga,  Lord Chatham, a member of the British  House of Lords, concluded,  ‘‘I know  that the conquest of English America  is an impossibility. You cannot, I venture to say  it, you cannot conquer  America . . .’’  These principles to which the representatives of the 13 colonies pledged  their lives, their resources, and their  honor still apply to our Nation today.  It was on this day, July 8, 1776, that  the Declaration of Independence was  first read publicly, having been unanimously adopted by the Congress only 4  days before.  So, today, I am pleased to join with  my colleague Senator LIEBERMAN in  starting a new, bipartisan tradition in  the U.S. Senate. We will read the Declaration of Independence again.  During the next hour, we will also  hear from important leaders in our Nation’s history who saw these principles  of  liberty,  equality, and  justice as  timeless.  Patrick Henry urges us to consider  the consequences of weakly submitting  to a tyrannical authority in the hopes  of obtaining peace, rather than persisting in the fight to secure our freedom. In his famous speech at the Touro  Synagogue, George Washington establishes the importance of religious freedom for the Nation.  A few days before his inauguration,  Abraham Lincoln makes an impromptu  speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where he argues that the principles of the Declaration are incompatible with slavery. Finally, in his last  letter, Thomas Jefferson  reflects on  the significance of the Declaration and  its timeless value.  I ask unanimous consent that Senator LIEBERMANand myself may enter  into a colloquy on the reading of the  Declaration of Independence and that  following  our  colloquy,  Senators  WHITEHOUSE, MURKOWSKI, WEBB, MARTINEZ, and LIEBERMANbe, in that order,  speakers for the remainer of morning  business.

Prudence, indeed, will  dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light  and transient causes; and accordingly  all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while  evils  are  sufferable,  than  to  right  themselves by abolishing the forms to  which they are accustomed. But when  a long train of abuses and usurpations,  pursuing invariably the same Object,  evinces a design to reduce them under  absolute Despotism, it is their right, it  is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for  their future security.—Such has been  the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such  is now the necessity  which constrains them to alter their  former Systems of Government.

306,Senate,110,-0.395,118,2008-07-08,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, I wish to  publicly  commend  and  congratulate  MG Galen B. Jackman, U.S. Army,  upon his retirement after more than 35  years of military service. During the  last 3 years, from July 2005 through  July  2008, Major General  Jackman  served as the Army Chief of Legislative  Liaison. He was instrumental in improving the understanding of Members  of Congress and staff concerning a wide  range of Army issues, in particular an  understanding of the Army’s role  in  the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the  resource requirements for an army at  war, and the effect of those wars on the  Army and its soldiers and their families. Major General Jackman worked  tirelessly to ensure that soldiers and  Army civilians had the resources necessary to maintain the Army as the  world’s preeminent  land  service. He  forged effective relationships with congressional Members and staff, always  responding quickly and effectively to  congressional requests for information  and assistance, and has been an invaluable advisor to the Secretary and Chief  of Staff of the Army.  General  Jackman’s  assignment  as  Army Chief Legislative Liaison was the  capstone to an outstanding career of  service to our Nation. Prior to assuming this position, Major General Jackman served as the Commanding General, U.S. Army Military District of  Washington  and  Commander,  Joint  Force Headquarters-National Capital  Region, Fort Lesley J. McNair, Washington, DC. His other  joint assignments include service as the Deputy for  Training and Readiness, United States  Pacific Command, and Director of Operations, United States Southern Command.  Major General Jackman served as the  Chief of Staff and Assistant Division  Commander,  Support,  for  the  10th  Mountain Division, Light, Fort Drum,  NY, deploying with the Division in support of OPERATION JOINT FORGE,  Bosnia-Herzegovina June 2000 to July  2001.  He began his service to our Nation in  1973 as a rifle platoon leader, Company  A, 1st Battalion, Airborne, 508th Infantry, 82d Airborne Division, Fort Bragg,  NC. His  leadership positions  include  serving as a support squadron commander in 1st Special Forces Group,  Airborne, Fort Bragg, NC; Commander,  2d  Brigade,  7th  Infantry Division,  Light, Fort Ord, CA, and director,  Combined Arms  and Tactics Directorate, U.S. Army Infantry Center and  School, Fort Benning. In his numerous  leadership  and  command  positions  throughout his distinguished  career,  Major General Jackman demonstrated  an unwavering commitment to the welfare of his soldiers and their families.  Throughout his career, he played an  important role in the development of  the future officers and leaders of the  Army.  Major General Jackman holds a master of science degree in procurement  and contract management  from  the  Florida Institute of Technology and a  bachelor of arts degree from the University of Nebraska. He is a graduate of  the Industrial College of the Armed  Forces.  His outstanding Service has been recognized  with  numerous  military  awards  including  the Distinguished  Service Medal, the Defense Superior  Service Medal, with Oak Leaf Cluster;  the Legion of Merit, with Oak Leaf  Cluster; the Defense Meritorious Service Medal; and the Meritorious Service  Medal, with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters. He  proudly wears the Expert Infantryman  Badge, the Master Parachutist Badge,  the Air Assault Badge and the Ranger  Tab.  Major General Jackman is married to  the former Ms. Cathy Dowd. They have  two children David, 20, and Patrick,  18. David will be a senior at Gilford  College this fall, while Patrick will attend Virginia Military Institute. I also  congratulate them on their husband’s  and father’s retirement from the Army.  The demands of military life are such  that military  families also  sacrifice  and serve the Nation along with their  soldier.  Mr. President, the Army, the Congress, and the Nation have benefited  greatly from the service of such a great  leader and soldier. He will be sorely  missed.∑  f  MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE  At 4:23 p.m., a message  from the  House of Representatives, delivered by  Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks,  announced that the House agrees to  the amendment of the Senate to the  bill (H.R. 802) to amend the Act to Prevent Pollution  from Ships to  implement MARPOL Annex VI.  f  MEASURES PLACED ON THE  CALENDAR  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the calendar:  H.R. 6377.

Bodin, who just completed  her services as President of the American Nephrology Nurses’ Association, ANNA, for her  dedication and  contributions  to nephrology  nursing and kidney patients across the country.  ANNA is one of the largest and most prestigious nursing associations  in America. The  organization  is  the recognized  leader  in nephrology nursing practice, education, research,  and advocacy. ANNA’s members are  registered nurses and health care professionals  at all levels of practice. They care for patients  of all ages who are experiencing, or are at risk  for, kidney disease. The organization’s mission  is to advance nephrology nursing practice and  positively influence outcomes for patients with  kidney or other disease processes requiring  replacement  therapies  through  advocacy,  scholarship, and excellence.  As an active member of ANNA, Sandra has  served as President, Vice President, and as a  member of the Board of Directors. Also, she  received the Ron Brady Memorial Award for  Excellence  in  Volunteer  Leadership  from  ANNA in 2002.  As ANNA’s president Sandra has  inspired  nephrology nurses to reach the highest levels  of practice and patient care. She is a visionary  leader who has implemented a broad range of  initiatives that will continue to improve care for  patients whose lives depend on dialysis and  other kidney replacement treatments.  Professionally, Sandra  graduated with  a  Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in Nursing from the College of Scholastica in Duluth,  Minnesota. She became a Registered Nurse  in 1977 and a Certified Nephrology Nurse in  1992. Sandra currently  is  the  lead Clinical  Informatics Analyst and Application Coordinator at the SMDC Health System in Duluth  Minnesota. Sandra has also worked at the Miller-Dawn Medical Center and St. Mary’s Hospital, both in Duluth.  I honor her efforts to promote the care of  those suffering from kidney disease. I recognize her achievements as a nurse, patient advocate, and healthcare  leader.  I commend  Sandra on her service  to  the American Nephrology Nurses’ Association and our country.  Please join me in commending Sandra M.  Bodin for her years of vision, leadership, and  commitment.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE MISSOURI  NATIONAL GUARD  HON.

308,,110,-0.345,139,2008-07-08,Mr. COURTNEY.," Madam Speaker,  I am  proud to introduce legislation today that will restore fairness for our military technicians, who  work every day in Connecticut and across the  Nation to support our National Guard.  If the National Guard serves as the backbone of our military, then our military technicians serve as the backbone of our National  Guard. They play a critical role  in ensuring  that our National Guard is ready to respond  and deploy  in support of military operations  abroad by supporting the training, equipment  repair and restoration, logistics and other critical functions.  Military technicians are known as ‘‘dual-status’’ employees, through which they must retain membership in the Air or Army National  Guard in their State in order to maintain full-  time employment as a technician. Dual-status  military technicians are subject to the restrictions of the Technician Act of 1969, 32 USC  709, and other provisions of  the  law under  which they are specifically prohibited from receiving certain benefits and rights available to  them as members of the National Guard, such  as reenlistment bonuses and student loan repayment assistance. In addition, if a member  of the National Guard becomes a technician  within 6 months of receiving an enlistment or  reenlistment bonus,  the Department of Defense can, and often does, require  them  to  pay back those bonuses.  The law also fails to fairly compensate technicians for the increased overtime hours that  technicians must work to fulfill their mission by  providing technicians compensatory time, rather than monetary compensation, in return for  overtime work. Many technicians cannot use  the compensatory time without impacting time-  sensitive military work schedules and, with the  military’s current ‘‘use it or lose it’’ policy under  which such time is lost if unused within 21 pay  cycles, many technicians face the prospect of  losing the time off they have earned.  Last summer, I had the chance to visit the  1109th  Aviation Classification  and Repair  Depot, AVCRAD, in Groton and see first hand  the work  they were doing  to support of our  National Guard. There, nearly 300 military  technicians provide maintenance and logistics  for aircraft and equipment for 14 States across  the northeast and supports Connecticut’s fleet  of Black Hawk helicopters. During my visit, the  leadership of the unit described how busy the  facility has been over the past several years.  They’ve literally been burning the midnight oil  in trying to keep up with the demand of keeping equipment repaired and ready to deploy.  It’s an  incredible operation, and one  that  is  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:42 Jul 09, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A08JY8.008 E08JYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2008
309,,110,0.565,146,2008-07-08,Mrs. MUSGRAVE.," Madam Speaker,  I rise  today to honor the Koshare Indian Dancers,  who are celebrating 75 years of history and  culture.  The Koshare Indian Dancers offered refuge,  hope, and a spirit of camraderie to boys during Depression-era America. In 1933, a group  of young boys from southeastern Colorado decided to study the heritage of their area. They  formed an archaeology and Indian club where  they could study the history, culture and artifacts of the lower Arkansas Valley. Soon, with  the help of  their young Scout master, J.F.  ‘‘Buck’’ Burshears, they were meeting with elders representing both the Plains Indians and  many different Pueblos across New Mexico  and Arizona. The elders embraced the youthful enthusiasm of these boys, teaching them  dances, songs, and many different aspects of  the ways of their ancestors. Buck dubbed the  new club Koshares, the Hopi word for ‘‘clown’’  or ‘‘fun maker,’’ and the Koshare Indian Dancers have been going strong ever since.  ‘‘The club grew beyond anything we ever  thought it would be,’’ said Dr. William Sisson.  He and his friend Robert Inman held the first  meeting of the Koshare Club. Soon it was an  organization of hundreds of boys, who continued to pass on their knowledge from generation to generation. An important part of what  they passed on was love for, and protection  of, the land, living honestly and with integrity,  and  learning how  to be a  leader who embraces community service. That sense of service grew from a community focus to a nation-  wide focus, as hundreds of Koshares served  in every war in which the United States has  fought since World War II.  ‘‘Doing  those dances was demanding and  required hard work,’’ said one of the original  organizers, Jimmy Taylor. ‘‘The dances were  important to learn, but it was more important  what you  took with you  throughout your  life  from the experience. It gave young boys an  outlet for their energy, gave them a sense of  accomplishment, and it trained their minds to  analyze and complete a project.’’ Mr. Taylor  went on to West Point and served his country  during World War II with honors.  The loss of Koshares during World War II  spurred  their vast collection of art and artifacts. In memory of their fallen comrades, they  originally bought three paintings. By continuing  to gather pieces over the years, the Koshares  amassed one of the most extensive collections  of southwestern art and artifacts in the West.  Service remains a large part of the meaning  of the organization. The Koshares continue to  foster leadership skills and to provide an environment for young people to learn about the  heritage of Southeastern Colorado. They also  persist  in sharing  that heritage with others  through  their museum  and  performances.  Boys, and now girls, benefit from the program,  and the Arkansas Valley is richer because of  the  history  and  culture  provided  by  the  Koshare  Indian Dancers.  It  is my distinct  honor to recognize the Koshares and to wish  them continued success.  f  COMPTROLLER RECOGNIZES  THE  SIGNIFICANCE OF RELATIONSHIP  WITH THE CARIBBEAN DURING  CARICOM CONFERENCE  IN NEW  YORK  HON.

310,,110,-0.465,146,2008-07-08,Mr. CLYBURN.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to a wonderful constituent  on  the occasion of her 100th birthday. Mrs.  Cassie Keitt Weeks of Fort Motte, South Carolina will become a centenarian on August 5,  2008. This is a remarkable milestone that few  of us are ever able to achieve.  Cassie Keitt is the daughter of the late Hattie Young and Elijah ‘‘Bub’’ Keitt of Fort Motte.  She was married to the late Jesse Weeks, Sr.  Mrs. Weeks  can  trace  her  ancestry  to  slaves on the Lang Syne Plantation and the  Goshen Plantations in Fort Motte. Both Mrs.  Weeks and her husband were employed by  the Peterkin family at the Lang Syne Plantation until their retirement.  The church is a central part of Mrs. Weeks’  life. Her great-grandfather  is on  the original  deed as an organizer of Mt. Pleasant Baptist  Church in Fort Motte. It was the first church  organized by former slaves in the community,  and Mrs. Weeks attends  that church  today.  She  is among  the church’s staunchest supporters and serves in a number of capacities.  She  is a Church Mother, a member of  the  Senior Choir and Sunday school class, and  serves as a pastor’s aide. She is an avid fundraiser, a homecoming and friends and family  day captain, and a member of the building and  kitchen committees. She also serves as  the  church historian. When asked about the secret  to her longevity, Mrs. Weeks replies, ‘‘trusting  in the Lord.’’ She also adds, ‘‘I like it on this  side. This is all I know, so I will stay as long  as I can.’’  Among her other pleasures when she was  able were making Lye soap and quilting bees.  The Weeks home was always the gathering  place  for  friends and  family. Today she still  enjoys sitting on  the porch and entertaining  visitors. She  is also a very avid voter, and  never misses the opportunity to cast her ballot.  Mrs. Weeks family provides her tremendous  strength and  joy. She  is  the mother of  four  children: daughters Rebecca Weeks Brown  and Hattie Belle Weeks Scott and sons Jesse  Weeks, Jr. (deceased) and Julius Weeks.  She  is  the grandmother of eight; great  grandmother of eighteen; and the great, great  grandmother of three. In addition she has a  host of nieces, nephews, cousins and many,  many friends.  Madam Speaker, I invite you and my colleagues to join me today in wishing a happy  100th birthday  to Cassie Keitt Weeks. This  strong matriarch remains independent and active, and serves as an example  to us all.  I  wish her health, happiness and Godspeed on  this momentous occasion!

311,House,110,-0.347,3,2008-07-17,Mr. CARNAHAN.," Mr. Speaker, with  high gas prices crippling the American  economy, this country needs a long-  term energy plan to lower gas prices,  make America more  secure,  create  green jobs, and reduce global warming.  House Democrats support responsible  drilling as part of our comprehensive  strategy,  but many Republicans  in  Washington say we need to do more  drilling in our pristine oceans and wilderness areas, even though 300 million  acres of public land, more than three  times the size of California, are already  open for leasing. They want us to give  more public  land  to Big Oil,  even  though 68 million acres of land are already leased and not being developed.  Today, the House will consider the  DRILL Act. I urge my colleagues to  join us in passing this vital legislation  that will  speed up  development  of  NPRA, require Big Oil to use the land  they have leased or lose it, and ban foreign export of Alaskan oil to ensure  our oil stays in America.  Mr. Speaker, this  is commonsense  legislation  that  does  exactly what  many are asking for, more drilling. So  why don’t they support a bill that requires Big Oil to drill and not  stockpile more leases?  just  f  b1015  A START TO LOWERING GAS  PRICES  (Mr.  BOUSTANY  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)

And I would  like to yield to the gentleman from  Colorado to tell us about this meeting  that took place and why he can make  the accusation that George Bush and  DICKCHENEYas a result of this private  meeting have raised oil prices. That  meeting took place years ago. I would  like to hear about this.  I would yield to the gentleman.  ",2008
313,House,110,-0.317,10,2008-07-17,Mr. KAGEN.," Mr. Speaker,  today’s  impossible prices for oil have finally  forced America to ask the essential  question: ‘‘Where’s the plan?’’ We’re in  a situation where every business, every  homeowner, every retiree, every local  and  State  government  and  every  United States citizen is being forced to  live under crisis management which is  a recipe for failure.  To become an energy-independent nation, the first step we must take together is to develop a plan, but not behind closed doors, but to do it right  here in the open. So let’s stop pointing  fingers and start holding hands. Let’s  join hands. Let’s begin to think together because we’re really all in this  together.  And let’s agree. Let’s begin by agreeing that a successful energy plan must  begin to  include three essential elements. First, drill  for new oil right  here in America with any such oil obtained from within our territorial waters or national boundaries being sold  to American citizens first. And the Oil  for America Act will do just that. Secondly, we must invest in every form of  renewable energy available and provide  the tax incentives for wind, for solar,  geothermal,  biomass,  cellulosic  and  every form of clean, home-grown energy. We have to provide those incentives  so private  industry will  take  charge and take the lead. And third, we  must act to prevent any price manipulation anywhere in the world in our oil  marketplace.  Now we have already passed legislation. We passed H.R. 6377. This was to  direct the CFTC to do immediate oversight  to  prevent manipulation. We  passed a farm bill that moves us towards  energy  independence,  towards  home-grown ethanol and energy. But  we can’t grow our way out of this problem. We also closed the Enron loophole, guaranteeing that the marketplace will work more effectively.  Drill for new oil in America, invest in  renewable forms of energy and prevent  energy price manipulation. But our  economy  is still dependent on  fossil  fuels today and foreign sources of energy, unfortunately. But oil is still one  of our most precious assets. So let’s  make certain that the more than 140  billion barrels of oil that are underneath America go to Americans first.  Now you have a choice here. We have  to work  together. Under  your  approach, we will have a solution 10 years  from now. Under our approach, we will  have a solution in 10 days, because the  SPR, Strategic Petroleum Reserve, was  opened up several times in the past. In  1991 there was a 33 percent decline in  the price of oil almost immediately. In  2000, it went down nearly 19 percent.  The oil price went down 9 percent in  2005. We can bring about rapid short-  term relief even as we plan for the future. But we cannot solve this problem  by drilling alone. We cannot solve it by  growing corn alone. We have to work  together.

315,House,110,-0.379,17,2008-07-17,Mr. YARMUTH.,"  I  thank  the gentleman from Vermont for yielding.  And, you know, we have a wonderful  situation in here. We have a very interesting and productive dialogue, I believe, about something we all want to  do, and that’s to solve our energy crisis  to take the pressure off the American  consumers whose lives are being terribly affected, adversely affected, by  these high gas prices and the economy  as well.  I call back to the words of a very  smart person who once said the significant problems that we have today cannot be solved by the same  level of  thinking that created them. And unfortunately, this idea that we are going to  drill our way out of the problem, both  the short term and the long term, is  the same level of thinking that got us  into this problem. The man who said  that was Albert Einstein. He was a  pretty smart guy.  What we are proposing, and you have  heard many instances of it and suggestions of it today, is that we have the  ability, we have the resources right  now to have an impact, a downward  impact on prices. All we have to do is  free our own oil, free America’s oil. It’s  in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  As my colleague  from Oregon  just  pointed out, we have been able to reduce the price three separate times  over the last 17 years by releasing that  oil. We can do it again and we should  do it again. But more importantly than  that is the entire attitude we take toward what’s down the road, no pun intend.  My colleague from Tennessee on the  other side of the aisle just mentioned a  few minutes ago, he asked where are  the electric cars, where are these hybrid cars? Well, actually, they’re very  close on the horizon. We met with Ford  executives just a few weeks ago in my  hometown  of Louisville, Kentucky.  They are on the verge of some significant breakthroughs. They have a plug-  in hybrid that uses hydrogen power, as  well as electricity. They’re working on  a  battery  car. They  have  several  versions of alternative power sources  they’re working on.  General Motors has promised to have  a battery-powered car on the road in  2010. We know in California there’s a  new manufacturer that’s developed a  battery-powered car.  These are the technologies that will  be our future. We need to be investing  in them, because as President Bush  said the other day, what we are trying  to do with this long-term approach is  change the psychology of the market,  change the psychology of the speculators, so that if they see down the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:39 Jul 18, 2008 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17JY7.034 H17JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2008

339,Senate,110,0.219,66,2008-07-17,Mr. STEVENS.," The letter says:  Twenty years ago, 21 percent of oil contracts were purchased by speculators who  trade oil on paper with no intention of ever  taking delivery. Today, oil speculators purchase 66 percent of all oil future contracts,  and that reflects just the transactions that  are known. Speculators buy up a  large  amount of oil and then sell it to each other  again and again. A barrel of oil may trade 20-  plus times before it is delivered and used; the  price goes up with each trade and consumers  pick up the final tab. Some market experts  estimate that the current prices reflect as  much as $30 to $60 per barrel in unnecessary  speculative costs.  If those pieces of paper that represent future delivery of oil are purchased by people who are just speculating and  that purchaser  ends up,  after selling the paper, acquiring  it  again, to me, that is absolute proof of  a criminal conspiracy in this country.  I think this speculation has to stop.  We have to start talking more about it,  and we have to do something about it.  What I would do is make sure it is a  criminal matter  if someone acquires  the same piece of paper dealing with  futures in oil and has no ability to use  the oil. I really do not think there is  any reason—I can understand a company might buy ahead for 2 or 3 years  in  oil  and  buy  futures  and hedge  against  the price,  that,  in  fact,  it  might go up, but people who buy those  pieces of paper solely to manipulate  the price—and that  is what happens  when someone not involved, these institutional investors, buys a piece of  paper to buy oil in the future and then  sells it to another institutional investor and then another one. If that piece  of paper ends up in the same hands the  second time, to me, that is a criminal  conspiracy, and it is time we looked at  that and understood it. This letter sets  it forth.  Believe me, any Member of the Senate who ignores this letter ignores the  fact that every single  frequent  flier  person in the country has it in their  hands. I don’t know about the rest of  you, but I am getting thousands of letters from people who are sending me  this letter and saying: What are you  going to do about it? I say what we  have to do about it is send a signal to  these speculators to take notice that  Congress is serious about speculators.  I know there is a difference of opinion out here on the floor of the Senate,  there is no question about it, but in the  last 5 years, investments in commodity  index funds jumped from $13 billion to  $260 billion. That means institutional  investors have gone from owning $13  billion worth of oil futures to $260 billion in oil futures.  Now, someone tell me that is not a  conspiracy.  Let me put up this chart. This chart  represents the so-called NYMEX oil futures. The red on the chart represents  the price of oil; the gold represents the  volume of trading. The volume of trading has gone up, but the price has gone  up more than twice as much as the volume.  There  is only one thing that can  drive up a spike like that. That is speculation,  it  is not demand. Someone  told me not to try to understand supply and demand in the oil business. I  think I know something about oil demand in the oil business, because we  tried to meet that demand in terms of  our State. We had a better chance of  satisfying the demand of the United  States than any State. But to have this  situation go along I think is wrong, to  go forward I think is wrong.  I have personally talked to one of the  economists. I must say he does not  share my  feelings that we ought to  make this a crime  immediately, because, it is my understanding, he does  not believe we have seen evidence of  criminal conduct yet.  But I say it is criminal conduct if  someone owns one of those pieces of  paper twice. There is no reason to sell  a future in oil and then turn around  and buy it later at a higher price. They  are actually being acquired and turned  over more than 20 times before the oil  is delivered. That ought to be something the Justice Department and the  CFTC should have notified us on before  it took the time of all of these presidents of these companies to send this  letter to their customers so they can  send it on to us. These people have told  their customers to contact us. Well,  this is one time I hope all of us listen  to what they are saying. Because there  is no question that we have to find  some way to restrict this trading to  those who need oil in the future, those  who legitimately hedge to try and save  their customers money, not to cost  them more money but to save money.  A true hedge would save money for the  customers of the particular person who  acquired the futures.  I think the legislation Senator FEINSTEINand I introduced some time ago  represents an  important step toward  breaking this bubble. The position limits we would place on institutional investors would be very minimal and  would make them stay away from market manipulation.  If we can see these investments shift  away from the energy commodities and  back to the stock markets the way we  have in the last few days, I think the  stock market would recover.  I thank my friend from New Hampshire  for  letting me use part of his  time. But I say, we cannot stop at  mandating transparency. We have to  do something to put these people in  fear before they will stop this action of  driving this price up.  EXHIBIT1  An Open letter to All Airline Customers:  Our country is facing a possible sharp economic downturn because of skyrocketing oil  and fuel prices, but by pulling together, we  can all do something to help now.  For airlines, ultra-expensive  fuel means  thousands of lost jobs and severe reductions  in air service to both large and small communities. To the broader economy, oil prices  mean slower activity and widespread economic pain. This pain can be alleviated, and  that is why we are taking the extraordinary  step of writing this joint letter to our customers. Since high oil prices are partly a response to normal market forces, the nation  needs to focus on increased energy supplies  and conservation. However, there is another  side to this story because normal market  forces are being dangerously amplified by  poorly regulated market speculation.  Twenty years ago, 21 percent of oil contracts were purchased by speculators who  trade oil on paper with no intention of ever  taking delivery. Today, oil speculators purchase 66 percent of all oil futures contracts,  and that reflects just the transactions that  are  known.  Speculators  buy  up  large  amounts of oil and then sell it to each other  again and again. A barrel of oil may trade 20-  plus times before it is delivered and used; the  price goes up with each trade and consumers  pick up the final tab. Some market experts  estimate that current prices reflect as much  as $30 to $60 per barrel in unnecessary speculative costs.  Over seventy years ago, Congress established  regulations  to  control  excessive,  largely unchecked market speculation and  manipulation. However, over the past two  decades, these regulatory limits have been  weakened or removed. We believe that restoring and enforcing these  limits, along  with several other modest measures, will  provide more disclosure, transparency and  sound market oversight. Together, these reforms will help cool the over-heated oil market and permit the economy to prosper.  The nation needs to pull together to reform the oil markets and solve this growing  problem.

Antonio encompasses the goal of the NFIB  Young Entrepreneur Foundation (YEF) which  encourages young people to consider careers  in small business and entrepreneurship and to  help further the education of these students.  Antonio started his own photography business  in Boise.  In  light of his successful business  operation he was awarded a scholarship for  higher education. He is only one of 416 high  school seniors across the country to receive  this distinguished award.  YEF has encouraged and supported the entrepreneurial dreams of 1,900 students with  scholarships  totaling $2,200,000.  I commend  NFIB and YEF  for  this outstanding accomplishment and commitment to our youth.  I am honored to take this opportunity to congratulate a  leader of our next generation of  small business owners. Antonio,  I wish you  much success in your future endeavors.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

345,House,110,0.57,5,2008-09-16,Mr. BURGESS.," Before I came to the  United States Congress, in another life,  I was a physician, and oftentimes when  I was introduced to speak at an engagement back home, the person doing the  introductions will say, Do you want to  be referred to as Doctor or Congressman? I usually start off with perhaps a  little lighthearted humor in that, Well,  physicians still enjoy about a 70 to 80  percent approval rating with the American public, and Members of Congress  enjoy about a 7 to 8 percent approval  rating with the country. So, mother always called me Doctor, and that  is  what I’d prefer to be called. But it’s  really a sad commentary on the institution that our credibility is at such a  low ebb.  Now we just had the gentleman from  Tennessee talk about an editorial in  the New York Times. Since he brought  it up, let me refer attention to the New  York Times from yesterday. Reading it  on  the airplane up here,  they  referenced the fact that we have a serious  problem with  the  chairman of  our  Ways and Means Committee and the  credibility has been lost for the individual who is head of the largest tax-  writing body  in  the House of Representatives.  The Tax Code in this country is complex. No one understands it. People understand how mistakes can be made.  But the chairman of that body, at the  very least, ought to hold himself above  reproach. And yes, maybe one transgression,  perhaps  two,  but  transgression  after  transgression  after  transgression is more than the American people can tolerate.  We are going to debate an energy bill  today. But the fact is we are not really  going to accomplish anything on energy. Yes, I know they have the votes.  They can pass pretty much whatever  they want. They can ram  it to the  floor, like they did last night, 15 minutes before it goes to the Rules Committee, and then here on the floor, as if  by magic, today. But this bill is dead  on arrival in the Senate. It is going to  do nothing to help the American people.  Here’s the tragedy. Out in the countryside, no one believes that we have  the ability to do much of anything. We  couldn’t talk about border security or  immigration reform because we have  no credibility. We can’t  talk about  what we are going to do with the economy because we have no credibility.  The credibility of  this  institution  was badly damaged prior to the 2006  election, and I grant you it was an  election strategy by the other side that  worked. Paint the working majority at  that time as one that wasn’t working,  and we will get to take credit for it and  we will get to take power.  So look at where we are today, 221⁄2  months later. Are we out of Iraq? I  don’t think so. Are gas prices lower? I  don’t think so. All of those things were  promised during the run-up to the last  election. And, yes, they promised to be  the most ethical and competent Congress that the country had seen  in  quite some time.  Now I call on the 30 new Members on  the majority side who were elected on  this platform to stand up. Stand up in  your conference and be counted. Now is  the time. We have a serious crisis of  credibility on one of the major committees in the United States Congress,  and we can’t get past that point. One  individual holds in his hand the power  to begin to restore some of the credibility to the  institution that we so  sorely need.  I call on the freshmen Democrats to  ask the chairman to step aside, whether  temporarily or permanently, but  step aside until he solves his own problems so that the institution is not left  carrying that weight. I think the institution of the House of Representatives  deserves no less than that courtesy at  a time when our economy is suffering,  our energy prices are high, and certainly the ability of the country to defend  the border has been  seriously  questioned. This is the time.  This is the time that the House needs  to have maximum credibility to get  these issues accomplished and, at the  same time, here we are talking about  the same things and over and over  again.  Again, I call on the freshmen Members, stand up to your Speaker, stand  up to the powerful committee chairmen. Let’s move past this point. You  have other capable members on the  majority side on the Committee on  Ways and Means who can serve, either  temporarily or permanently, to serve  that body, and  let’s move past this  point.  It’s time. The American people are  waiting on us to do the big work, and  we can’t do it because we are bound up  in these seemingly endless quandaries  that we find ourselves in. Let’s show  the American people that we can lead.  Maybe then they will restore some of  the credibility to us.

347,House,110,0.855,26,2008-09-16,Mr. FLAKE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I guess that some on  the majority side think that they can  cover up just by yelling or by raising  the volume here of debate.  The bottom line here is, and the reason for this point of order, is that the  majority party thought that, all right,  we can have a bill here, or we can  sneak something in. Let’s sneak a limited tax benefit for New York.  You can call it an earmark, that’s  the proper definition when you have a  limited tax benefit. You can call it a  banana. You can call it anything you  want to. The bottom line is the majority tried to sneak something into a  broader bill that’s supposed to be about  energy, and that’s what this is about.  So nobody is trying to distract anybody, other than those who are trying  to slip a provision in that doesn’t have  to do with any comprehensive energy  plan. It has to do with New York.  You can raise your voice, and you  can yell all you want. The bottom line  is somebody tried to sneak a limited  tax benefit into this legislation. That’s  why I support the point of order.  ",2008

Initially this  was air-dropped into the overall bill to  help New York recover after 9/11 by  Chairman Thomas. So I guess to some  degree Chairman Thomas is responsible  for this particular provision being here  today, without consultation with not  only  the  ranking member, CHARLIE  RANGELat the time, or MIKEMCNULTY  from New York State. Even his own  colleague from the Republican side of  the aisle, Amo Houghton at the time  who was a Member, was not consulted  about the addition of this into the legislation.  ",2008

350,House,110,-0.502,33,2008-09-16,Mr. MARKEY.," I thank the gentlewoman.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very  simple debate. The Republicans are  very upset  that  the Democrats are  going to take the oil companies and  make them pay taxes to the American  people when they drill on the  land  owned by the American people, and the  Democrats  then want  to move  the  money over to wind and solar and plug-  in hybrids for tax breaks. So the Democrats are saying that America needs an  oil change. So, as Mr. GREEN just said,  we open up vast new areas where the  oil industry can drill, drill, drill; drill,  baby, drill.  But what we put  into the bill  is  something  else as well. We put  in  change, baby, change. Because we only  have 3 percent of the oil in the world,  we have 4 percent of the population,  and we consume 25 percent of the oil in  the world on a daily basis. That is not  a long-term recipe.  So we need an oil change. And what  we need to do and what we are going to  do is allow them to drill in thousands  and thousands of additional acres, to  go for the oil, to go drill, baby, drill,  but then say we need back some of  those tax breaks that you don’t need at  $100 a barrel, $140 a barrel, $4 a gallon  at the pump. We don’t need to subsidize  you anymore.  The  taxpayer  doesn’t need  to  be  tipped upside down and have money  shaken out of their pockets as taxpayers to hand over to the oil companies, because they have already been  tipped upside down and had money  taken out of  their pockets as consumers by the oil companies.  So we  just  take  back  those  tax  breaks, put a  little bit of a tax on  where they don’t pay any taxes at all,  and where do we shift it over to? Ladies and gentlemen, we shift it over to  wind and solar and green buildings and  plug-in hybrids. We shift it over to the  future. We unleash a technological revolution that will break our dependence  upon imported oil.  It is change, baby, change. It is innovate, baby, innovate. These guys are a  one-note organization. They have been  since two oilmen went to the White  House 8 years ago.  Drill, baby, drill is not a long-term  strategy.

352,House,110,0.69,89,2008-09-16,Mr. LAMBORN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today as my colleagues across the aisle  try to deceive the American people  with this none-of-the-above, no energy  plan. H.R. 6899, the Democrat energy  bill, does nothing to address lawsuits  from radical environmentalists, which  means that leases will be tied up in  court for years. It allows no drilling  within 50 miles of American shores.  This alone rules out most of the promising areas in the Gulf of Mexico. It  gives no revenue sharing to States that  allow offshore drilling. This bill would  actually  cost  these  States money.  States will have no incentive to allow  drilling from 50 to 100 miles. It imposes  tax increases on oil companies right  when they need to invest in new development. These tax hikes will be passed  on to consumers and will raise the  price of gasoline and home heating oil.  It does nothing to promote oil shale,  nuclear power, clean coal, new refineries or Alaskan oil.  I am concerned about using oil shale  in particular, being from Colorado. According to estimates, there are 1.23  trillion barrels of oil in oil shale deposits  just  in government-owned  lands.  This legislation does not provide a solution that advances oil shale development. It is estimated that access to  this American supply of energy could  supply American  domestic  gasoline  needs for 200 years.  In essence, the Democrat bill does  not open up offshore drilling as it purports to do. It makes no progress on  other major sources of energy. And it  actually raises the cost of oil and gas  through tax hikes and raises the cost  of electricity through its renewable energy standards. This bill is not just a  sham and a fraud, though it is that. It  will actually damage our economy. It  will kill jobs, and it threatens our economic future as a country.  ",2008
353,House,110,0.749,89,2008-09-16,Mr. SHADEGG.,"  I  thank  the gentleman. My colleague on the other side  just said nobody got everything they  wanted out of this bill. The reality is  nobody gets anything out of this bill.  Nobody gets anything of out of this bill  except the environmental groups who  will sue to block all oil production. The  reality is we are legislating to solve a  crisis that we created. It was the Congress at the urging of environmental  groups that blocked Outer Continental  Shelf drilling. It was the Congress that  blocked drilling in the Inter-Mountain  West. It was the Congress that blocked  drilling in Alaska.  Do you know what that has done?  That has cost Americans jobs. That has  cost the people  in my district their  chance to earn a livelihood because we  locked that all up. Are we opening it  up today? Is my colleague right that  this is a compromise? Absolutely not.  We are not opening up one  single  square inch of drilling. Let me make it  clear. The Sierra Club said  ‘‘we are  working very hard on this bill to ensure that its focus is not expanded offshore drilling.’’ Mr. MURTHA, a close  friend of Speaker PELOSI, said, he admitted that, this is a political month.  Last Wednesday, he said that there are  all kinds of things we are going to try  to do that will go away after we leave.  They don’t plan to produce oil under  this bill. It’s just talk. The legislative  director of  the  radical Natural Resources Defense Council acknowledged  the same thing about the Democrats’  ploy: ‘‘This is about politics, not necessarily  about  policy.’’  Democrats  know that not a drop of oil will be produced because  lawyers will  file  lawsuits stopping every single one. Let me  make the point: The administration  last year  issued  487  leases  in  the  Chukchi Sea. Environmental  groups  sued to stop and have stopped all 487.  The administration has a total of 748  leases in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort  Sea. How many  lawsuits have been  filed and how many leases have been  challenged in lawsuits? All 748.

Not for strategy for the security of the United States of America.  That defies logic, I would say.  And to swap out sweet Texas crude  for heavy Venezuelan oil at the same  time also defies logic to track this.  Why would anybody come to the floor  and defend opening up the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve?  But, Mr. Speaker, I came here to address this overall energy piece. And  first, I’m for all-American energy all  the time. I want to open up all of it.  And I’m also for an open process, not  for a 290-page bill that hit the presses  last night at 10 o’clock and the Rules  Committee at 10:45. How in the world  could they evaluate it? And furthermore, what’s the purpose of this constitutional process if there is no subcommittee, no committee, no amendments allowed anywhere along the line,  amendments denied at the Rules Committee as well, a closed process—yes,  an open debate for 3 hours, but not a  process that allows perfection?  So it seems to me that we’ve handed  the  entire authority of  the United  States Congress over to the Speaker  from San Francisco, who writes a policy, 290 pages, that doesn’t do anything  for us.  And I would add, Mr. Speaker, that  even the Outer Continental Shelf, if we  do nothing,  it opens up. If this bill  passes and becomes law, then it blocks  out the first 50 miles, and litigation  blocks that out and all of the rest.  I have here a copy of the Federal  Code. This is the legislation that ended  litigation on the North Slope of Alaska  in 1973. That’s what it took. No one got  through the environmental litigation;  it was an act of Congress. If we don’t  have an act of Congress, we’re not  going to get through this litigation,  and all of our energy is going to be  locked up, Mr. Speaker.  So this bill does nothing for corn ethanol, coal, ANWR, nuclear, the first 50  miles, oil shale, natural gas, hydroelectric, or the litigation that’s blocking it.  b2000  ",2008
355,House,110,0.513,110,2008-09-16,Mr. BOEHNER.," Let me thank my  colleague for yielding. Let’s just stop  and think for a moment about what  our constituents are dealing with tonight as we stand here. They have got  concerns about the economy, concerns  about keeping their own  jobs. They  have concerns about whether they are  going to be able to put gas in their car  tomorrow considering the high price of  gas. Or we have the home heating crisis  about to come to us as they are filling  their propane tanks and oil tanks and  looking at the heating bills that are  coming this winter.  And what are we doing? We are sitting here tonight in the middle of the  biggest hoax I have seen in the 18 years  I have been in Congress. It is a sham,  and everybody in this Chamber knows  it is a sham. I know those are strong  words and words that I don’t use lightly, but I want my colleagues to consider this for a moment.  We have a bill here that purports to  be a compromise, but I don’t know one  Republican Member who was involved  in one meeting with regard to this  compromise.  It was written by  the  Democrat  leadership  that  runs  this  Congress in the dark of night on a napkin. It showed up here last night at  9:45, a 290-page bill at 9:45 last night  that no Member had ever seen; and  guess what, as we stand here tonight,  no Member has read.  All right, some Member, any Member  stand up and tell me you have read this  bill. That is what I suspected. Not one  Member has read the bill that we are  about to consider. No hearings on the  bill, no committee action, no one has  read, and the bill purports, purports to  increase American energy. But I want  you to consider this: 85 percent of the  known reserves off of our coast on the  Outer Continental Shelf, 85 percent at  a minimum are locked up permanently  under this bill. And of the 15 percent  that are purportedly opened, the States  would have to comply to open those  Outer Continental Shelf reserves. But  there  is no  revenue  sharing  to  the  States like there is in Texas and Louisiana and Mississippi and other areas.  There  is no revenue sharing, so the  States have no incentive to want to  open up the Outer Continental Shelf.  So how much new drilling will we get  out of this bill? Zero. It is just zero.  And there isn’t a Member in this body  who doesn’t know it is zero. So when I  call it a hoax or a sham, I think you all  understand what I am trying to say.  No new nuclear plants in this bill, no  new oil shale drilling in this bill. No  clean-coal technology in this bill. We  are the Saudi Arabia of the world when  it comes to coal. We have clean-coal  technology. Whether it is coal to gas,  coal to liquid, we have ways to use our  coal in a clean way. Nothing in this bill  will allow it to happen.  What does it have in it? It has a big  old tax increase in it; you can be sure  of that.  What else does it have in it? It has a  big earmark in it: $1.2 billion for the  City of New York on behalf of one  Member in this bill. Here we are trying  to take some steps toward energy security, and we have to load it up with a  big old earmark, $1.2 billion.  A compromise, huh? This is no compromise. The compromise might have  been amongst a bunch of Democrat  chairmen who wanted to have some  bill, but there is no compromise here.  Let’s just describe this bill for what  it really is. It is nothing more than political cover on the eve of an election  to say that we voted for an energy bill,  except there is no energy in it.  Congressional approval today  is at  the lowest point in any time since polling began, and our Members wonder  why.  b2100  And it’s stunts like this that have  the American people so cynical about  their Congress. They expect that the  Congress  is going  to do  something  about increasing energy security in our  country; that we’re going to do something about bringing down the high  cost of gasoline; that we’re going to do  something about bringing down  the  high cost of heating oil or propane or  natural gas this winter.  And what are we doing?  Playing political games on the eve of  an election.

356,House,110,0.34,124,2008-09-16,Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania.,"  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I want to thank the leadership on  both sides. I want to thank all of the  Members for the opportunity tonight  to offer America the first bipartisan  energy bill that may have been offered  in this century written by Republicans  and Democrats in a room with just cold  sandwiches night after night, working  with no lobbyists, no power brokers,  trying to come together like the American people want us to. They want affordable, available energy as soon as  we  can  get  it,  and  they want  it  ongoingly, and they deserve it.  We’re the most powerful Nation in  the world, and it’s unfair to the American public that their future depends  on weather in the gulf, that their future  depends  on unstable  countries  that provide us half of our imported  oil. We get half of the 70 percent we import from friends and half of it from  unstable nations. The American people  are not comfortable with that. They  want better.  And the American people know that  our energy system could be sabotaged  each and every day by the terrorists  because there is no slop in the system,  there’s no surplus, there’s no extra.  There’s just enough oil to meet the oil  demand each day, and whenever anything goes wrong, the prices skyrocket.  Folks, we have the chance here to reevaluate  our  policies.  I understand  many years ago when we set it aside, it  was cheap: $2 gas, $10 oil, use theirs,  save ours. Folks, that day is gone. We  need to now reassess where we’re at.  We need to be energy independent in  this country, and we need  to  start  down that long road. It won’t be easy,  and it needs to be a broad-based plan.  Our bill opens up the Outer Continental Shelf. It takes away all the prohibitions that have been put upon the  Department of the Interior for leasing  land. It repeals the prohibition of preventing Federal agencies from entering  into contracts for procurement of alternative and synthetic  fuels. It repeals limitation on the number of new  qualified hybrid and advanced clean-  burn technology vehicles eligible  for  the alternative vehicle tax benefits.  That’s electric and gas cars.  It allows the use of woody biomass,  the fastest growing renewable we have  that’s  fueling pellet stoves and  factories with wood waste and will be part  of cellulosic ethanol as we move from  corn to cellulose, prohibited today by  law  from using off of Federal  land,  wood waste. Removes that.  Folks, it removes the prohibition on  shale oil, the biggest oil opportunity  this country has ever had. And folks, it  takes the revenues and funds the renewables better than they’ve ever been  funded.  It  funds conservation better  than  it’s ever been  funded. It  funds  clean-up efforts, environmental clean-  up efforts. It funds carbon sequestration with large amounts of money.  And let me read you that paragraph  which I think is vital:  ‘‘The Carbon  Capture and Sequestration Reserve offsets  the cost of  legislation enacted  after the date of the enactment of the  National Conservation, Environment  and Energy Independence Act to promote  research  and  development  projects associated with carbon capture and storage in the production of  liquid transportation fuels, electricity,  synthetic natural gas, chemical feedstock and for the disposition and recycling/reprocessing  of  nuclear waste  from nuclear power plants.’’  It will fund LIHEAP for those who  are not going to be able to afford their  heating this winter.

Since 1862  the Rock  Island Arsenal has  been providing  the supplies and equipment  American soldiers need to protect this country.  Today  the  Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center (JMTC)—under  the command  of  the Army Materiel Command—continues  that proud tradition of meeting the needs of  our Armed Forces.  JMTC’s technological and manufacturing expertise has been essential  to protecting our  nation in the 21st Century. At no time was this  fact more evident than when insurgents in Iraq  began using improvised explosive devices to  attack Humvees and other military vehicles.  The Army needed an immediate solution and  JMTC was  the  only manufacturing  center  ready and able to provide it. JMTC used their  rapid-response design and manufacturing capacity  to produce dozens of  ‘‘up-armor kits’’  before final engineering was even complete. In  a matter of days the first armor kits were designed, produced, and on their way to Iraq. To  date, JMTC has produced thousands of armor  kits and is poised to expand their armaments  development into new titanium and lightweight  composite materials.  JMTC is truly a center of industrial and technological excellence. In 2006 and 2007 they  earned  the Shingo Prize Public Sector Gold  Medallion  for  the Forward Repair System,  making JMTC the Army’s only two time winner  of this prestigious award. JMTC has also met  high work standards with  the M119 Towed  Howitzer, gunner protection armor kit, shop  equipment contact maintenance vehicle, and  small arms parts program.  Madam Speaker,  the women and men at  JMTC are indispensable to our long-term national security. This  facility  is poised  to develop the materials and technologies we will  need to protect the United States for decades  to come.  f  HONORING PASTOR DONALD BATTLE  OF  DIVINE  FAITH  MINISTRIES INTERNATIONAL  Georgia law enforcement as a police detective  for the City of Atlanta. Pastor Battle’s ministry  began in 1990 as Divine Faith Baptist Church  with a group of 60 members. Today, Madam  Speaker, Divine Faith Ministries  International  currently serves God with a membership of  over 8,000. This explosive growth can be directly traced to the servant leadership of Pastor Battle and his family.  But Pastor Battle does not content himself  with service in the church alone. A leader in  the community, Pastor Battle has served  in  the Association of Christian Ministers of Clayton County, and guided  the creation of  the  Clayton County Public Schools’ Mentorship  Forum. The forum includes business leaders,  judicial system leaders, state and local elected  officials and pastors who serve to mentor high  school students. Pastor Battle also led the call  for  incorporating  the  faith community  in  the  Clayton County youth offender program  to  allow churches to be involved in the juvenile  offenders’ community service program.  Other  examples  of  Pastor  Battle’s  unshakable commitment  to  the 13th District  and the entire Atlanta area are Divine Faith  Ministries  International  television broadcasts  which reach  thousands of homes weekly, a  day  care  program—Divine Faith Ministries  Christian Academy, and the Divine Faith Ministries School of Biblical Studies.  Again Madam Speaker,  I am honored  to  recognize this great man on his birthday. His  presence, his purpose and his commitment to  service have blessed not only his family, his  friends and his congregation, but undoubtedly  the entire world as the effects of his ministry  are felt in the hearts of thousands. Thank you  for  the opportunity  to honor Pastor Donald  Battle, his  family and Divine Faith Ministries  International.  f  HONORING RYAN DANIEL SALMON  HON. DAVID SCOTT  OFGEORGIA  HON.

Today I rise in support of H.R. 4828,  the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park Boundary Expansion and  Redesignation Act of 2008. The battle of  Resaca de la Palma—fought in 1846 in  what is now the city of Brownsville,  Texas—marked one of the early victories  in  the United States-Mexican  War for the American forces.  General Zachary Taylor, who would  later become the 12th President of the  United States, was a very notable participant in this battle.  b1315  The United States troops suffered 45  men dead and 228 wounded; Mexican  forces counted 169 dead and 228 wounded.  H.R. 4828 will expand the Palo Alto  Battlefield National Historic Site, currently under the National Park Service, to include the Resaca de la Palma  Battlefield site.  The bill will preserve the battlefield  site,  support  education  and  special  events there, and develop an interpretive trail with exhibits, living history  programs, and other community gatherings.  The site will also conserve the increasingly rare Rio Grande delta landscape and protect native  chaparral,  prairie and brush, and native species. It  used to be more than 100 acres, but now  it has been reduced to 34 aches of land,  so we need to preserve this site.  Though the battle at Resaca de la  Palma was fought by two warring nations, it is historically significant because it is unique to the south Texas  border culture. More than just a relic  of the past, the Resaca de la Palma  Battlefield is a vast, outdoor classroom  that preserves a vital piece of our Nation’s history.  My hope is that scholars, historians,  and everyday citizens will learn and  appreciate the sacrifice of all those  who perished here on this battlefield.  A coalition of local groups, community leaders, and private citizens has  done a tremendous job in maintaining  the Resaca de  la Palma.  I wish to  thank them for their hard work and  dedication in preserving an important  piece of our Nation’s history.  But it is now vital for the site to  have full support and resources that  only the National Park Service can  provide. I ask my colleagues to join me  in support of this legislation.  And  I  thank  you  and Chairman  and Chairman BORDALLO for  supporting this bill.  ",2008

It’s a companion  bill  to H.R.  4847, which passed  the  House in April with unanimous support  after moving through the Committee  on Science and Technology by regular  order.  This act authorizes the activities of  the United States Fire Administration  for fiscal year 2009 through 2012. USFA  provides critical support to our Nation’s  firefighters  through  training,  through research and development and  through  logistical  support. For  instance, the USFA provides firefighter  training to over 80,000 firefighters per  year; it compiles nationwide data on  fire control and prevention activities,  and  it oversees the  fire grants programs  that  have  dramatically  improved the capabilities and the preparedness of our Nation’s fire services.  This is an extremely important agency in our committee’s jurisdiction. I’d  like to thank Mr. MITCHELL and Dr.  GINGREY, vice chair and ranking member of the Technology and Innovation  Subcommittee,  for  their hard work  over the past year on this matter.  The United States Fire Administration does a wonderful job of providing  support to first responders across the  country.

374,Senate,110,-0.37,108,2008-09-22,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President,  I  want to speak about this bailout we  have been asked to do. Starting last  week, we were told by the powers that  be in the Bush administration we needed to do a $700 billion bailout to stabilize our economy.  When we heard that, Americans became scared. People who save for their  retirement, those who have been faithful  in paying their mortgage, those  who have worked hard to pay for college, are wondering what is going on.  People who have worked hard  and  played by the rules are wondering, are  they being asked to bail out those who  did not? Americans are mad as hell and  they want to know what about them.  They watched Wall Street executives  pay themselves  lavish salaries. They  watched them do irresponsible lending  practices. They watched them do casino  gambling  on  risky  investment  mechanisms. And now those very same  Americans  who  worked  hard  and  played by the rules, were prudent investors, prudent savers, prudent citizens, are asked to pay the bill for those  who did not.  Now,  it  is  for those people that I  know the Government must do something. We must protect our economy  and we must protect our way of life  and we must protect our middle class.  Sure, the economy is in a crisis. And,  yes, we do have a credit crisis. Wall  Street did make very bad decisions.  But now they are asking Main Street  to pay the bill. We must act to restore  our confidence in our economy. I agree,  we must act promptly. But this Senator will not be stampeded into voting  for this Bush administration bill.  So far during the last 7 years, every  time there is a crisis, they generate  fear and they generate bad ideas. Do  you remember after the horrific days of  9/11 when we all came to the floor and  pledged our patriotism? I said, we needed to put politics aside because we  needed to be the red, white, and blue  party. Well, they took advantage of  that. And in that process we passed  something like the PATRIOT Act, allowing our Government to act with  undue secrecy with no parameters. We  created the dysfunctional Department  of Homeland Security.  Now we are being asked to deal with  the fiscal crisis and the financial crisis.  I am concerned we are going to create  a fiscal FEMA. We must act with resolve, but we cannot be a rubberstamp  for the administration’s proposal. This  proposal gives sweeping authority to  those who were asleep at the switch in  the first place.  Remember the Fed? Remember the  maestro at the Fed who plunged down  interest rates, and now helped create  the housing bubble? Then there is the  Treasury. There is the Secretary of the  Treasury. A couple of months ago he  said, no problem—like our President  ‘‘fundamentally sound.’’  Then a couple of months later they  said, oh, there is a problem. And we  have lurched from one bailout to another: Bear Stearns,  the  insurance  company, oh, no, not to Lehman, then  after that failed, so we have gone from  ‘‘no problem’’ to lurching around, to  now $700 billion and a blank check.  We have  seen  those George Bush  plans before. Now this one is a three-  page bill. It gives the Secretary of the  Treasury unlimited power to intervene  in our financial markets without any  review  by  Congress,  agencies,  or  courts. They make the Secretary of the  Treasury a financial czar, a financial  potentate, because it says: Give us a  blank check with no balances.  Well, I say: No checks without balances. Even the President of the United  States of America has to come to us to  declare war. I believe the Secretary of  the Treasury should be accountable to  the Congress and to whether mechanisms—if he is going to intervene with  $700 billion in his pocket. I say no regulations without  any  safeguards. No  way. No blank check. There must be  regulations. There best be safeguards.  If they do not want regulation, no way.  If they do not want safeguards, no way.  We are in uncharted waters, so we  need to ask tough questions. First, how  do we know it will work? What guarantees are there it will work? Could this  bankrupt our Treasury because it has  no parameters? Could it cause runaway  inflation,  further  eroding our  economy? What are the safeguards?  Also, who is going to benefit? Is it  going to be the same Wall Street go-go  guy, the same Wall Street casino types  who are going to benefit now? Whatever we do, we have to insist that those  who created this scandal do not benefit  from the bailout: no golden parachutes.  Let them feel the hard landing that  my constituents faced when they were  laid off at Bethlehem Steel. Let them  feel the hard landing of what it is like  to have your mortgage foreclosed upon.  Let them feel the hard landing my constituents are facing right now. We do  not need to subsidize bad behavior.  Now George Bush said he was the  first MBA President. Well, hello, I do  not have confidence in this administration. Remember, this was the same  crowd that brought us Katrina, FEMA,  and ‘‘hey, you are doing a good job,  Brownie.’’  Well, is this what we are now supposed to say to those who are managing our finances? I don’t think so.  We also have to prudently ask ourselves, are there better alternatives?  Let me be clear: I do believe we need to  act promptly but with safeguards. We  need to act with resolve, but we need  to have regulation and even retribution. If we have stabilization, which I  believe we must do, we must also have  reform. We are all looking at the administration’s plan, but I want everyone to know where I stand. At a minimum, the plan must, first, be limited  and  temporary.  It  cannot be open-  ended. There also must be a plan for  those who have had those hard landings on Main Street. We need to put  people first, to keep people in their  homes, those who have had some of the  most  significant mortgage  payment  challenges, no golden parachutes that  reward  top executives  for  their excesses,  their  recklessness, and  their  sheer stupidity and greed, no blank  checks. There must be accountability  and oversight. Rescue does require reform, regulation, and a strong possibility of retribution. It must be transparent. I am for prompt action, but I  will not be stampeded the way I have  been stampeded in this institution by  this administration in the past.  We need to make sure we do it right.  That means not handing over a blank  check or getting rid of the balances.  We have to ask tough questions and be  sure we have the right principles. If  not, then the taxpayers will be on the  hook. If we make the wrong decisions,  taxpayers will be on the hook not only  for Wall Street’s bad decisions, but I  don’t want to set this up for Government’s bad decisions. We need to get  Government back on the side of the  people who need it. We need to put the  public good over private profits. This  means we need to take a look at a 21st  century regulatory system. I am tired  of  seeing  this  laxity where what  emerges when we deregulate  is  the  emergence of sharks and whales. Either  way, the minnows get swallowed up.  We don’t want our economy to sink,  and I think it is time to swim. But  when we do, we need to make sure we  are asking the right questions. We need  to fight for the middle class. We need  to fight for the people who go by the  rules. We need to have a legislative  framework that rewards those who did  their very best and might be having a  temporary spill.  I look forward to hearing more about  this plan, but right now I need to know  more. I need to be reassured more, and  I need to be absolutely sure that those  who created the crisis don’t benefit  from it and we don’t leave the middle  class with all of the responsibility.

375,Senate,110,-0.517,122,2008-09-22,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. President, I wish  to say a few words on the crisis about  which everyone in America is talking.  My phones, both in Vermont and here  in Washington, have been bouncing off  the hook with people who are outraged  about the prospect of the middle class  bailing out Wall Street. They are telling me: No way; we should not be doing  that.  The current  financial crisis  facing  our country should, in fact, put an end  to almost any support for the extreme  rightwing economic policies President  Bush has been pursuing for the last 8  years and that, in fact, were pursued  even before that.  These  policies  include,  of  course,  huge tax breaks for the very rich under  the guise that that money will trickle  on down to ordinary people and create  a prosperous nation. That certainly has  not been the case.  Those policies include unfettered free  trade, which says it is a good thing for  corporate America to be able to throw  American workers out on the street,  move to China, and bring those products back into this country and run up  what is now over a $600 billion-a-year  trade deficit.  Last but not least, and pertinent to  the great financial crisis we are facing  right now—a crisis which many people  believe is the most serious financial  problem this country has had since the  Great Depression of 1929—is the whole  of deregulation, not only of financial  services but of energy and many other  sectors  in our  economy, under  the  guise that we should have great faith  in  large  financial  institutions,  that  they will do the right thing and that  they will benefit  the people of our  country and, in fact, the world.  We have learned tax breaks for the  rich do not filter down but make the  rich richer. We have learned unfettered  free trade costs us millions of good-  paying jobs. We have learned that massive deregulation, allowing large financial institutions to do whatever they  want to do under the radar screen, will  only hurt our economy and maybe  drive it to ruin.  In the midst of all this, it is important to understand what has been going  on for ordinary people in this country.

As a member of  the United States sabre  team, Tim won a Silver Medal at the Beijing  Olympics.  He began fencing in seventh grade at Riverdale Country Day School, and switched to the  sabre from the foil in the eighth grade. His skill  got him  recruited by Brandeis University  in  Waltham, Massachusetts. There he became  one of the top college fencers in the country,  qualifying for the NCAA championships three  times.  At Brandeis, Tim was a history major and  served as a resident adviser for 2 years. After  graduating, he became a part of Teach  for  America, an education consortium that aims to  bridge the achievement gap between different  socio-economic groups. Morehouse went  to  Intermediate School 90 in Washington Heights  as a 7th-grade English and social studies  teacher.  As a  former  teacher  I am proud of Tim  Morehouse  for his abilities as an Olympian,  but even more so for his dedication to helping  others. He is an example of the scholar-athlete who, having achieved his goals,  then  helps others to achieve theirs.  We are proud of Tim Morehouse. To be an  Olympian takes dedication and training, and a  lot of both. It takes a different kind of dedication to devote your life to helping others. I congratulate Tim for being superb on both counts.  CONGRATULATING  HURST  MAIN  POST OFFICE AS A VOLUNTARY  PROTECTION  PROGRAM  STAR  SITE  HON. MICHAEL C.

The Hurst Main Post Office  is one of  three  postal VPP sites in the Fort Worth area.  The Voluntary Protection Program promotes  success through effective worksite safety and  health. Approval into the Voluntary Protection  Program  is  the Occupational Safety  and  Health Administration’s way of officially recognizing  the outstanding efforts of employers  and employees who uphold exemplary occupational safety practices.  The distinction as a  ‘‘Star’’ site displays  Hurst Main Post Office’s sustained excellence  in all areas of safety and health management  systems. This excellence stems  from strong  leadership, participation, and commitment  to  quality.  I commend the Hurst Main Post Office upon  their receipt of this distinction for their commitment to exercising safe and healthful working  conditions. Their efforts serve as an example  to all, and I am proud to be their representative in the 26th District of Texas.  f  HONORING MAXWELL BOWERS  HON.

379,Senate,110,-0.326,65,2008-09-30,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  today I am pleased to submit, along  with Senator BENNETT, a  resolution  supporting National Cyber Security  Awareness Month.  The  connectivity provided by  the  Internet has profoundly changed almost every aspect of our lives, but it  has also given rise to what I view as  the next great threat to our national  security and our economic security,  the danger of cyber attack, cyber espionage, and cyber crime.  At the policy  level, responding to  this threat requires the development of  advanced technologies combined with  creative  new  Government  policies.  Above all, we need to focus on improving the cyber security of the Federal  Government  and  the  critical  infrastructure, including our electric power  grid,  communications,  banking,  and  transportation systems. These are all  critical to our way of life and we must  work together to ensure they are secure.  Of course, whatever we do to monitor  and thwart bad actors on the Internet,  we must be careful to preserve the privacy and civil liberties of U.S. persons,  especially during the transition from a  legal structure based on older technologies to a legal structure designed  for the Internet age.  We must also think about the best  way  to  communicate  our  national  cyber security policy to the public.  Though some elements of the threat  and our response must be kept classified, the public needs to understand the  general nature of the threat we face,  the Government’s responsibility to secure the internet, and how Government  involvement will affect U.S. persons  and privacy.  Fortunately, I am happy to report an  increasing level of interest and debate  on Capitol Hill and around the country.  Here in Washington, in the past year,  the Senate Intelligence Committee has  held two hearings and many Member  briefings, setup a working group with  seven staff, sponsored two Technical  Advisory Group studies, and worked  with other congressional committees  in a bipartisan manner on cyber issues.  Back home in West Virginia, at our  State Homeland Security Summit, we  held a productive session focused on  cyber security for State and local leaders. I have taken on this issue as a priority of  increasing  importance, but  much work remains to be done. I encourage  everyone  to help me  raise  awareness and develop effective channels of communication on this issue.  One of the ways we can raise awareness is by supporting National Cyber  Security Awareness Month, coming up  in October. Each year, the National  Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security joins with  the National Cyber Security Alliance,  the Multi-State  Information Sharing  and Analysis Center, and other organizations working to improve cyber security in the U.S. to support National  Cyber Security Awareness Month.  The goal is to educate and empower  Internet users to take simple steps to  safeguard themselves from the latest  online threats and respond to cyber  crime; and to bring Federal agencies,  national organizations, businesses, and  educational  institutions  together  to  encourage development and implementation of cyber security best practices.  I thank my distinguished colleague,  Senator BENNETT, for cosponsoring this  resolution and  for his  leadership on  this issue. I look forward to working  with Senator BENNETTand other members of Congress to improve our cyber  security in the future.  f  SENATE RESOLUTION  698—DESIGNATING  OCTOBER  17,  2008,  AS  ‘‘NATIONAL  MAMMOGRAPHY  DAY’’  Mr. REID (for Mr. BIDEN(for himself,  Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. CASEY, Mrs. DOLE,  Mr. LEAHY, Mrs. BOXER, Mr. INHOFE,  Mr. WHITEHOUSE, Mr. JOHNSON, Mr.  WYDEN, and Mr. BAYH)) submitted the  following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:  S.

381,,110,-0.553,93,2008-09-30,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Madam Speaker, the Trinity College class of 1958 celebrated its 50th  anniversary of graduation this past May, in a  festive  gathering  of  classmates  renewing  friendships, reliving prized memories of  their  campus years, and sharing experiences of career paths followed since Trinity days.  With my late wife, Jo, I met and came to respect and love the extraordinary women of the  class of 1958: Bobbi Marhofer, Fran Collins,  Judy Pauley, Carolyn Moynihan, among others, and those, like Jo, who are no longer with  us—especially Jo’s dearest friend in the class,  Sara Lucas.  The 1958 commencement address delivered  by Senator John F. Kennedy could not have  been more compelling or memorable than the  reflective, thoughtful retrospective reunion address offered by Class of 1958 alumna Colette  Hoppmann Dowling, a gifted,  talented,  internationally renowned writer. Ms. Dowling invites  not only her classmates, but all of us to consider soberly, profoundly,  the risky status of  older women who live alone—a condition none  of the exuberant graduates in 1958 could ever  have anticipated.  I invite my colleagues to read and reflect seriously on this message and its public policy  implications.  Colette Dowling  is an  internationally  renowned writer of eight books whose ‘‘The Cinderella Complex’’ was translated into 23 languages. She is currently completing training in  psychoanalysis and has a private  therapy  practice in Manhattan. Ms. Dowling gave the  following talk to her classmates at the Trinity  University Class of 1958’s fiftieth reunion, on  May 31, 2008, in Washington, DC.  FACINGDOWNTHEBAGLADY: OLDERWOMEN  INAMERICA  (By Colette Dowling, LMSW)  Six years ago, in the spring of 2002, I was  barreling down the Mass Pike towards Woodstock, my ten-year-old Saab stuffed to the  tops of its windows with computer and printer, fax and stereo, with towels and sheets and  comforter, with  jeans and shirts and one  good outfit in case I needed it. Last but not  least, my writing desk, which fortunately  can be dismantled for transport. Some surgeries that fall had slowed me down and I’d  had to give up my house in Woodstock and  spend the winter at my son’s, in Massachusetts. Now I was returning to the town I’d  called home for 20 years. I rather liked that  I’d reached the point where I could travel  light, but I had to ask myself: How light is  light? I was down to my last sixty dollars  and waiting  for my next  social  security  check to arrive. The market value of my JP  Morgan portfolio? One-tenth of a cent, according to the statement I’d just received.  Although my account had long been worthless they were still sending me the things. I  guess they were hanging in for the long haul,  as I was.  Basically, when I wasn’t imagining what  my parents would think if they could see me  now, I was telling myself, ‘‘I’ll handle this.’’  I  was  reminding myself  that  I  was  unencumbered and had an able mind. But I’d  sold almost everything I owned, not in order  to enter a convent (although the thought had  crossed my mind) but because royalties from  my books had seriously dwindled. In recent  months  I’d  found myself  thinking,  ‘‘I’ve  worked hard all my life, sent my children to  college and graduate school. How could this  have happened?’’  Earlier that year I’d written a proposal for  a book on discrimination against women in  the workplace. Fifteen publishers read  it,  and fifteen gracefully declined.  ‘‘We agree  with her thesis,’’ one editor told my agent,  ‘‘but the subject is too down.’’  Too down, indeed. In my 35 years as a writer, this was my first rejection of a book proposal and it fueled my apprehension that the  winds of change were upon me. To stabilize  my later-life income I’d begun living in a  rented cottage and substantially cut my expenses. But then came two shockers, first, a  mastectomy for an early stage cancer. Then,  three weeks later, on the afternoon of September 11, I entered the emergency room  needing  surgery  for an obstructed bowel  caused by adhesions from a prior appendectomy. That winter, after recuperating at my  son’s, in Massachusetts, I forged ahead with  research for another book proposal. That,  too, came to naught. Suddenly it seemed as  if everything in publishing had just dried up.  For a while, an interest-free loan from the  Authors League Fund was what got me by.  Two  surgeries,  two  rejected book proposals, three strikes and you’re out. I had to  come up with something radical and decided  to pursue an old dream. I’d long had fantasies of becoming a psychoanalyst. I would  need a masters in social work before I could  be accepted into an analytic training institute. With two weeks to meet the deadline I  applied to Smith College and that summer—  the summer of 2002—I began classes. It was  going to be a long haul. Smith would take  two years and the analytic training another  four. I knew that by the time I finished I’d  be over 70.  Once I entered school things were a little  less  rocky,  financially,  thanks  to  school  loans from the government. But of course,  once Smith ended so did the loans. I needed  a job, at least for the first couple of years of  analytic training, while I was getting my  practice up and running. I became a counselor for homeless children in the Brooklyn  public schools. The kids were great but the  commute was hellish. Each day after working with the kids I traveled an hour by subway to the Upper West Side of Manhattan to  see patients in the clinic of my analytic institute. For over a year I was clocking fifteen hours a week on the subways, with  house music and hip hop leaking from people’s headphones. I grew up on Junior Walker  and Elvis Presley and yearned for the day  when I could buy an Ipod in self defense.  After a while, catching a little breathing  space, I began to do some research on how  my  finances stacked up against those of  other older women. What  I  learned was  shocking. The economic constraints I was  experiencing were not only far from unique,  the odds had actually been in favor of my becoming an older woman who had found herself, at sixty-five, facing down the bag lady.  Particularly at risk are older women who  live alone. Over a decade ago a U.S. Committee on Aging found that half of older  women living alone had incomes below $9,500  a year.  But whether or not they live alone, the  picture for older women is pretty dim. According to the AARP Public Policy Institute,  the median income for women over 65 is just  about $3,000 above the Census definition of  poverty. Older women have slightly over half  the money older men have.  A third of us are getting by on $12,000 annually, often on much less. Poverty by any  other  name,  although  the  government  doesn’t consider an individual officially poor  if she’s got more than $8,000 coming in. The  women who live on nothing but Social Security—and that’s almost a quarter of us—certainly fit in the officially poor category.  The only person in this country with less  economic protection than the older white  woman is the older woman of color. Of those  over 65 and living alone, seventy-seven percent of blacks and seventy-nine percent of  Hispanics are poor, once they’ve paid their  social security taxes, according to the Census Bureau. Forget that they don’t have pensions, many women of color don’t even get  Social Security—those,  for  example, who  work in domestic labor or agriculture, fields  of endeavor in which the pay is so low it’s  often impossible to meet the minimum for a  so-called  ‘‘working  quarter’’.  Without  enough  of  these  quarters,  these women  who’ve worked all their lives picking peas  and scrubbing floors in order to support their  children, end up with nothing.  The truth is, women travel the borders of  poverty at many points  in their—as students, or young single mothers, or as older  women living alone. The National Women’s  Law Center reports that 70% of women in  America earn less than $20,000 a year. Forty  percent earn less than $10,000. Women are  twice as likely as men to be poor, a disparity  that increases with age.  For some time I’d though there must be  something wrong with me for having arrived  at such a low down place, some elemental  bad thing. It’s because I never fully understood that the financial pressures I endured  at different times of my life were standard  for a women—first, as a woman entering the  job market, in 1958, later as a widow and a  single mother. I’d always held the conviction  that the economic price women pay for bearing children was temporary; sooner or later  they catch up. Now that I’m seeing things  from the other end of the age telescope, I’m  beginning to get the picture. They never  catch up. According to the National Center  for Women and Retirement Research,  for  every year a woman stays home caring for a  child, she has to work an extra five years to  recover lost income. I needed only to apply  the five-year-per child formula to my own  situation to understand why I hadn’t retired  at 65. Three children equals  fifteen extra  years. Eighty, here I come!  The dire straits women face in old age have  little to do with age per se, Population Bulletin reports. It’s the economic disadvantages they face earlier in life that lead to the  insecurity  they  experience when  they’re  older. For example, two thirds of women who  work outside the home have no pensions.  When they do, their benefits are half of  men’s. A study from Brandeis that began in  1967 tracked 5,000 women over the course of  their lives and found that poverty in old age  was the direct result of  inequities they’d  faced when they were younger.  This certainly, is not the way the public  thinks about older women’s poverty, when it  thinks about it at all.  I’d always imagined that my work- and income-history would put me in a place far different than where my mother found herself  in her final years. A quarter of a century ago  I was fortunate to have a best seller, but fortune can be misleading. Royalties don’t last  forever. After The Cinderella Complex the  money I received on subsequent books was  only enough to get me through until the  next proposal. Like most writers I lived from  book proposal to book proposal. I’m proud of  the eight books I’ve written but the work  hasn’t provided me with long-term security.  So here I am now, in my seventies, with the  hounds of heaven at my heels.

382,,110,-0.396,100,2008-09-30,Mr. STUPAK.," Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Larry Inman as he receives Northern  Michigan University’s Distinguished  Alumni  Award. Larry is a northern Michigan resident  who has been an exemplary leader in business,  in his community and  in  the State of  Michigan. I ask that you, Madam Speaker, and  the entire U.S. House of Representatives, join  me  in honoring Larry as he  receives  this  award for his service to NMU and his community.  Larry earned an associate’s degree  from  Northwestern Michigan College  in Traverse  City before graduating from Northern Michigan  University in Marquette in 1976. He is a retired  vice president of Huntington National Bank.  Since he was first elected in 1993, Larry has  served as a Grand Traverse County Commissioner, where he has been instrumental in assisting with economic development  for  the  county.  Beyond his career in banking and service to  the Grand Traverse  region, Larry has also  served the State of Michigan in a number of  capacities. Since 1998, he has represented a  10–county region of  the Northwest Michigan  Council of Governments. He serves on  the  Michigan Community Corrections Board, which  he chaired from 1999 to 2006. Larry served 4  years on the NMU Board of Trustees and recently began a term with the NMU Foundation  Board of Trustees. He is also a lifetime member of the NMU Alumni Association.  Larry remains active in the Michigan Association of Counties  (MAC). He quickly  rose  through the ranks of MAC and served a term  as president of the organization. He travels to  Washington annually to represent the interests  of local governments across Michigan.  The Northern Michigan University Alumni  Association Awards are presented  to NMU  alumni who have been a positive influence on  their  professions  and  their  communities  through public service or distinguished themselves  through outstanding achievements.  I  can  think of no one more deserving of  this  honor than Larry Inman.  In addition to being a good friend of mine,  Larry Inman has distinguished himself through  his service to his community. His public service and continued commitment  to Northern  Michigan University are an example for us all  to follow.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and the entire U.S. House of Representatives join me in  congratulating Larry  Inman as  the Northern  Michigan University Alumni Association Board  of Directors honors him with the Distinguished  Alumni Award.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON.

385,,110,0.424,32,2008-12-09,Mr. HALL of Texas.," Madam Speaker, it is  my pleasure  to rise  today  to honor an outstanding citizen in the Fourth District of Texas  and my longtime friend, Bill Douglass of Sherman, as a 2008 Convenience Store Hall of  Fame Inductee.  This year’s Convenience Store News Hall of  Fame induction ceremony in October honored  Bill as much for his strong character, integrity  and community service as  for his business  achievements. Bill was honored for his tireless  efforts on behalf of the convenience and petroleum retailing industry and for the level of  integrity  that he has upheld over  the years.  The W. Douglass Distributing Company, which  Bill founded in 1981 and which he serves as  CEO, is a full-line distributorship and operator  of  the 15-unit Lone Star Food Stores chain  servicing the region of north Texas and southern Oklahoma. The company, which began  with just six employees, has grown to more  than 280 employees.  Throughout his career, Bill has been a tireless and effective advocate  for  the convenience and petroleum retailing industry. He has  served as chairman of the General Committee  of State Relations for the American Petroleum  Institute, chairman of the National Association  of Convenience Stores and director of  the  Texas Petroleum and Convenience Store Association, and he has testified on several occasions before Congress about issues important to his industry.  Bill  is also a widely  recognized and  respected member of the north Texas community, providing financial support and volunteer  efforts  to  various  local organizations each  year.  In 2002 he and his wife, Joan, were  named as the Outstanding Employer of Older  Workers for their strong belief in the value of  older workers by maintaining an age-balanced  group of employees. Their winning combination of younger workers and their older counterparts  has  created  a work  environment  where age and experience can assist in training, advice and counseling. The company has  no mandatory  retirement age and provides  flexibility in scheduling of employees’ hours.  Madam Speaker, Bill Douglass is the kind of  employer who leads by example. These are  some of the words that his employees used to  describe him and his  family  in a  full-page  newspaper ad:  ‘‘wonderful,  inspirational, brilliant, graceful, generous, charitable,  tireless,  encouraging, selfless, devoted, integrity.’’ Bill  Douglass embodies all of those qualities—and  I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing  this wonderful man and outstanding  American, Bill Douglass.
