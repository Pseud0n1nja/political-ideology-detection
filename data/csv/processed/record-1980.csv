0,Senate,96,-0.18,14,2,Mr. LONG.," I yield myself 2 additional  minutes.  So, Mr. President, the Senator seeks  to restore the pattern that existed prior  to the Senate bill. In doing so, he would  maintain an inequity that exists in the  law which should be corrected.  The Senate level of benefits is fairer.  If we are going to pay this higher level  of benefits to those in the middle brack ets, how would we excuse giving them a  better break than the low-income people?  If one group gets a better break under  the formula than another group, should  it not be logical that it be the pOOr, or  near poor, rather than the middle  in come? Logically, it should.  Mr. President, we have a good  for mula.  It was  carefully considered.  It  would save more than what the Senator  is  suggesting. This amendment would  cost $153 million more over the next 5  years than the bill recommended by the  committee.  Mr. President, where  the committee  to  came out with a bill that would be a  revenue gainer over the next 5 years of  about  $914 million,  this  amendment,  when added  to  the Bayh amendment  which has already been adopted, would  convert this bill from one which would  have gained  revenue  for  the Govern ment, by the overhaul and the various  changes made in the law,  to one that  loses  revenue  for  the Government by  about $79 million over that same period  of time.  I hope, Mr. President, the Senate will  give some sympathy and some encour agement to those committees which are  trying  to obey  the budget  resolution,  trying to obey that resolution the Sen ate voted for.  I myself offered  the amendment  get us to a balanced budget. I was not  even  the one who started  it. Senator  DOLE, the great Republican leader from  Kansas, offered an amendment that said  we were going to balance the budget. So  the Senator from Louisiana said. ""Fine,  let us get with  it,"" and  I offered an  amendment to the Dole amendment say ing, ""Bring us a balanced budget.""  I would hate to think. having voted to  say that we want a balanced budget, that  the Senate  is now going  to bust  the  budget with  these social welfare pro grams, because we know we will have to  spend money on such other  things as  more military equipment, Mr. President.  It just seems to me, if we want to be  responsible, we  should stay with  the  formula  the Finance Committee pro poses, because it is a good formula, makes  good logical sense. There are no inequi ties in it. In fact, it is a better formula  than that which exists  in the present  law.  ",1980
1,Senate,96,-0.124,14,2,Mr. JAVITS.," I yield myself 5 minutes.  Mr. President, Senator LoNG is always  a joy to listen to until we begin to analyze  his arguments.  I listened very carefully to all his argu ments, Mr. President. I heard a denunci ation of  the Bayh amendment, which  carried. I had nothing to do with that,  particularly. I did not propose  it. And  the Metzenbaum amendment, which al most carried. And Senator DoLE's bril liance as Republican leader, to which I  subscribe.  But I have yet to hear an answer to  the argument made by me, Mr. President,  as  to why  the amendment should be  passed in common equity, and why it far  from financially wrecks this bill.  I am not looking for a better break in  relation to present benefit levels for these  middle-income  recipients of disability;  only for an even break.  I think the appropriate figures show ing the difference from present law  is  the most eloquent testimony as to why,  in  common  elementary  fairness,  this  amendment ought to be carried.  Under the first three brackets, namely,  the working poor-1 am all for them where they get higher benefits than prior  earnings,  they are irrelevant for com parisons.  For $135 per month AIME, the present  ",1980

5,Senate,96,-0.211,53,2,Mr. CANNON.," I yield myself 5 minsupport of the amendment. They said:  The current airport development program  utes, Mr. President.  lacks sufficient flexibility to target funds to  Mr. President,  in  the bill as  intra areas of greatest need a.nd does not reoognize  duced, we had included a provision for a  State's role  in  the administration of  ADAP funds. With the exception of the  State aviation organizations, there was  very strong opposition to this provision  on the part of all interested parties. The  arguments are persuasive. First, it would  introduce another level of bureaucracy  into the ADAP process which would add  to the existing level of unresponsiveness  already in the system.  Also, there are considerable differences  amongst the 50 States with respect to  the  interest,  capacity,  and  expertise  needed  to undertake airport develop ment. This makes a uniform program  across State lines almost impossible.  Finally,  the principal feature of  the  legislation, the removal of the large and  medium hub airports from  the ADAP  program is a major change which will  affect airports at which 85 percent of all  enplanements take place. While the ra tionale and merits of ""defederalization''  are clear, it nonetheless is a signit:lcant  order of change and we did not want to  add a forced relationship to what already  is a major philosophical shift in the pro-  gram.  Most  important  though,  is  the fact  that the States have yet to convince even  one of the user groups, they claim they  will help, that the State involvement will  be a positive addition to the program.  Therefore, I believe we should charge the  State aviation directors with the task of  proving their ability to help airports and  win the support of at least some of the  user organizations. Presently the States  are willing to politically beat the same  groups they claim to want to help by  being added to the program. I cannot  believe  that kind of shotgun wedding  will improve the working of the ADAP  program.  Mr. President, let me say that the last  thing we need is 50 FAA's throughout  this country of ours trying to develpp an  airport system that is truly a national  airport system and/or an international  airport system.  Let me recite for my colleagues  the  groups that are opposed to this amend ment, and these are the people who are  the users of the airports and in a posi titon to know best.  The Airport Operators Council;  the  American Association of Airport Execu tives; the Air Transport Association; the  Commuter Airline Association; the Gen eral Aviation Manufacturers Association;  the Airline Pilots Association;  the Na tional Business Aircraft Association; the  National Air Transportation Association;  and numerous individual airport spon sors who have contacted the committee.  So I would say, Mr. President, that this  move is a move on the part of the avia tion authorities of a small number of  States trying to get their finger in the pie  and say, ""We want to determine how,  when, and where this money is going to  be spent and develop our own national  aviation system.""  It is obvious from  the list of people  that I read that those are the groups of  people directly affected with the opera tion of these airports.  So, Mr. President,  I  urge my col leagues to oppose the Levin amendment.  I may say that this same proposition  has been considered over a period of  .  .  ",1980

The convention c..ame on the heels of  President Carter's announcement of the  embargo on grain  sales  to the Soviet  Union. In my address, I stated that:  The President, in the face of Russian ag gression, could not continue to do ""business  as usual"" with the Soviet Union.  However, I also said that:  If it serves the national interest to invoke  the ""food weapon"" against the Soviet Union,  then  the nation, as  a. whole, should bear  the burden.  I  therefore proposed a series of steps  to make whole the American farmers af fected, in order to insure that the burden  of national policy is more equally shared.  I am now preparing legislation to imple ment these proposals.  Mr. President, so that my colleagues  may review the program I intend to in troduce, I ask that the text of my ad dress be printed in the RECORD.  The text follows:  LET JUSTICE BE DONE  It is an honor  to appear  tonight before  members of such an outstanding organiza tion as the National Association o! Wheat  Growers.

9,Senate,96,-0.426,79,2,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. Pres;.dent, January  22 marked  the  62d  anniversary  of  Ukrainian independence. That event oc curred early in the life of the modern  Soviet State, but the subsequent con quest of the Ukrai.ne by Russta proved  to be a portent of Russia's relations with  her neighboring States.  The people of the Ukraine lost overt  control over their nat;.on, but have re tained the spirit of i.ndependence. Mich igan has a  large Ukrainian community  which embodies the spirit and determi nation of Ukrainian people everywhere.  Recently, I received a letter from Dr. An thony  Zukowsky,  president  of  the  Ukrainian Congress Committee in De troit. The letter describes the struggle of  the Ukrainian people  for dignity and  human rights. I would like to insert this  letter following my remarks, and add my  voice in praise of the self-determination  of the Ukrainian people.  The letter follows:  JANUARY 22, 1980.  Hon. DONALD RIEGLE,  U.S. Senator,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR SENATOR RIEGLE: We WOUld  like  to  call your attention to the fact that Ukrain ians, all over the free world, including the  United States, wlll celebrate the Independ ence of Ukraine, in January,  January 22nd wlll mark the 62nd Anniver sary of the Proclamation of the Indeuend ence of Ukraine and  the 61st Anndversary  of the Act of Union, whereby all Ukrainian  lands were united into one independent and  sovereign nation. Both the Independence of  Ukraine and  the Act of Union were pro claimed by a duly elected parliament (Cen tral Rada)  in Kiev, capital of Ukraine, on  January 22, 1918 and January 22, 1919.  This sovereign Ukradnian state was imme diately recognized by a large number of na tions, including France and England. Diplo matic relations were established with them.  Recognition was granted,  also,  by Soviet  Russia. Despite the fact that the Soviet gov ernment had officially recogndzed Ukraine as  an independent and sovereign state Ukraine  was attacked, both by m111tary aggression  and by subversion from within.  For three and one-half years the Ukrain ian people waged a gallant struggle in de fense of  their country, alone and without  aid  from Western nations, but were ulti mately  overpowered  by  a  numerically  stron~er and better eauipned Russdan Bol shevik aggressor. They destroyed the Ukrain ian National Republic and created a Com munist puppet government known as  the  Ukranian Soviet Socialist Republic (Ukrain ian S.S.R.).  The entire history of Soviet-dominated  Ukraine is a ghastly record of inhumanity,  outright persecution,  terror and genocide.  Russification and denationalization plus vio lation of human rights, on a scale not known  in  the history of mankind, has occurred.  In summary,  the colonial rule of Soviet  commundsm  in Ukraine can be character ized by the following:  A. During the sixty years of Moscow rule  in Ukraine, mlllions of Ukrainians have been  annihilated by man-made famines, deporta tions and executions.  B. Both Ukrainian Orthodox and Ukrain ian Catholic Churches have been ruthlessly  destroyed and their clergy and faithful have  been arrested and persecuted.  C. All aspects of Ukrainian life are rigidly  controlled and directed from Moscow.  D. Permanent violation of Human and Na ti-onal Rights was  instituted  in Ukraine.  Thousands of Ukrainians have been charged  with  ""anti-Soviet  propaganda  and  agita tion"", tried and convicted. Many have been  tortured, incarcerated and confined in psy chiatric asylums where drugs and chemicals  are forcibly administered. Despite  the Im plementation of the Helsinki Accords, Soviet  oppression has  intensified in Ukraine. New  arrests of innocent people have been made  by  the Russians. The KGB, Soviet Secret  Police, has committed many murders. Mrs.  Ala Horska, poete.s:s and literary critic, was  murdered  in Kiev. This past year, music  composer, Volodimir Iwasiuk was murdered  in Lwiw, Ukraine. Members of the Ukrainian  Helsinki Groups were tried and given harsh  sentences.  Russian  enslavement  of  Ukraine  has  br::ught much suffering  to  the people of  Ukraine. In 1919-1920 Ukraine was the first  victim of Russian-Communist  aggression.  Since then, with passive indifference to the  Western world,  they have subjugated other  countries. The recent invasion and occupa tion of Afghanistan is the latest warning, to  the world,  that Russian  Imperialism poses  the greatest threat to all.  In spite of this oppressive yoke, Ukrainians  have never accepted this foreign domination  and are continuing their struggle for Human  Rights, Freedom and National Independence.  A new breed of adamant fighters for Human  and National Rights  gives us hope  that  Ukraine wlll be free again.  We would  like  to  express  our  sincere  thanks and appreciation  to  the President  of the United States, to the U.S. government  and to all members of the Senate and Ccn gre.ss  for. their untiring efforts  in bringing  many freedom fighters and dissidents, from  Soviet prh:ons,  to our great country and  giving them asylum here. God bless you all!  The Ukrainian people,  in the free world,  are celebrating the memorable January 22nd  as  their greatest holiday. For many years,  the 22nd of January has been proclaimed,  Ukrainian Independence Day,  in American  cities and states frcm coast to coast.  Therefore,  it is  in the common spirit of  liberty, faith and justice that the American  people,  and  especially  the U.S. Congre.ss,  join Ukrainians all over the world in giving  moral support  to  the Ukrainian people  in  their struggle for Human Rights, Freedom  and National Independence.  We appreciate, very much, your support  and concern for the welfare cf the Ukrainian  people.  Sincorely,  DR. ANTHONY ZUKOWSKY,  President.e  RECESS UNTIL 5 P.M.  ",1980

15,,96,0.612,157,2,Mr. ASHBROOK.," Mr. Speaker, this  week America heard the news of the  incredible escape of six employees of  the American Embassy in Tehran and  how the Canadian Embassy gave them  sanctuary and then aided their escape  from the country. The  tremendous  courage and daring of the Canadian  staff coupled with the great uru;elfish ness  they displayed' by pl_acing their  own lives in jeopardy is the most in spiring saga to come out of the trage dy of Iran.  The reports are not all in, but what  is kno\vn shows that Canadian Ambas sador Kenneth Tayl~r secretly housed  six members of the American Embassy  plus  a number of other Americans  since  the  first days of  the hostage  crisis. Over the long weeks of uncer tainty the Canadian diplomat and his  staff prepared to aid the Americans in  leaving the country.

16,,96,-0.373,157,2,Mr. NOLAN.," Mr. Speaker, when the  Carter administration  took office  in  January 1977,. the Nation's fanners  were facing crisis times. By the hun dreds.-they called the new Secretary  of Agriculture to warn him 0-f pending  economic disaster unless the adminis tration lived up to its campaign prom ises and established farm commodity  price supports at cost of production.  But  the Carter administration  re fused  to listen. Its meager proposals  for  the 1977  farm bill were greeted  with dismay by most Members of Con gress  from  farm districts. Congress  proved willing to improve the farm bill  to a greater extent than the President,  but his repeated veto threats resulted  in minimal changes.  '  In  the meantime.  the purchasing  power of farmers in-1977 dropped to  its lowest point since the depression of  the 1930's. Sueh low-farm income led  to massive unrest among farmers who  came to Washington in great. numbers  to protest and to work for a bett.er ag ricultural  program.  But again,  the  President's threat to veto any major  changes  prevented  from  passing a decent farm bilL About all  the farmers managed to ol;ltain was an  emergency  farm  credit program  to  keep  them hanging on. either until  J;heir  income  improved or until  the  loaris came due.  Now, in 1980, the final year in .this  administration's  term,  the Depart ment of Agriculture is predicting a 20percent drop in net .. farm income if no  production  shortfalls  occur . abroad.  USDA expects 1980 net farm income in 1967 dollars adjusted for inflation to reach only $10.5 billion-the lowest  level since 1967. This at a time when  inadequate  farm  income has caused  total  farm  debt  to  reach  record  -heig.hts.  In an analysis made after the recent  embargo on grain sales to the Soviet  Union, USDA predicted a bleak year  for-com producers if a diversion pro gram is not implemented this year.-In  adaition, USDA's figures show a $14  drop in net returns per acre for wheat growers this-year as compared to 1979.  Livestock producers also stand to lose  because  the cheap grain  is causing  heavy  livestock  to  be  brought  to  market~ thus resulting in lower prices.  While the futures market is register ing higher grain prices at the moment,  the current  returns  to  farmers are  much less. Record 1979 grain produc~  tion and large carryover stocks depress  the marke~s even though world stocks  are not sufficient  to meet a major  shortfall in production.

The  first communication was pre sented for  the President's .attention  well before he revealed ""his budget arid  alternative budget earlier this week. In  that letter, I urged the President to  follow the congressional intent relat ing to the provisions of Public Law 965 which  require  the President  to  submit a balanced budget if his own  budget proposal is not in balance.  Regrettably, the President has failed  to present to Congress an alternative  budget which in any realistic sense ap proaches the intent of the Congress in  this regard. My second letter addresses  this outright indifference and default  of du~. Though I intend to consider  fully all proposals to restrain Federal  spending and  to control the budget  deficit-and I am open to suggestions  by Mr. Carter on this point-the Presi dent's failure of  leadership on  the  budget is unforgivable. It is as though,  to paraphrase an ancient story, he fid  dled with the budget as inflation raged  and Americans' dreams succumbed to  those flames.  I  a.Sk  that  the  two  appear in the RECoRD:  letters  now  CONGRESS OF Til!: UNITED STATES,  HousE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, D.C., January 17, 1980.  THE PREsiDENT,  The White House,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: In Senate debate last  year, Senator Russell Long spoke in favor of  an amendment by Senator Robert Pack  wood which is now law, saying:  ""It requires the President . . . to .submit a  balanced budget. He does not hav'e to rec ommend a balanced budget, but he would  have to .submit one to us as an alternative.  Then we would know how the President and  his advisors would balance  the budget if  they were called upon to do so. They would  sa~ how they would propose to balance the  budget.''  With your budget submission due before  the end of the month, Mr. President, I trust  that you will follow the congressional Intent  relating to this provision of law.  The American people, I believe, feel that  their federal tax dollars. are not being man aged as efficiently as possible. A recent na tional survey by a respected major polling  firm shows this: the average citizen believes  48¢ of every federal tax dollar is wasted.  With ,this in mind, I would hope that your  balanced budget will reflect a savings attain able  through  better management. This  should result in a balanced budget which re quires federal spending that does not exceed  the level of t~xation you propose in your  unbalanced  budget;  preferably,  taxation  would be even less.  Last year. press accounts fl.ttributed a $2  billion budget saving to your unrealistic as sumption that interest rates would fall. Last  year, your budget proposal contained pro posals to cut Social Security benefits that  would hurt people least able to handle cut backs. It is my stficere hope that your lj981  fiscal year balanced budget will not rely on  such methods. Show us and  the nation  where bold cuts can be made.  Your long-standing promise to balance the  federal budget may have been broken by in creases in imported oil prices, but the oppor tunity remains to provide honest leadership  in the budgetary process by sending. to the  Congress an austere, believable, balanced  budget. I look forward to its receipt.  Sincerely,  TOM CORCORAN,  Representative in Congress,  15th District, nlinois.  CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, D.C., January 29, 1980.  THE PREsiDENT,  The White House,  Washington, D. c.  DEAR MR. PREsiDENT: Almost  two weeks  ago, I urged you to show the Congress and  the nation where bold cuts can be made in  the budget through a good-faith presenta tion of an alternative budget. I am dismayed  at your response to the congressional man date  to  submit  an  alternative . balanced  budget; it falls far short of illustrating~ as  Senator Russell Long phrased  it on  the  Senate floor, ""how the President and his ad visors would balance the budget if they were  called upon to do so.''  Your alternative budget tells us that in  order to balance the budget we would have  to accept no real growth in defense capabili ties through 1983, that we should have to  limit adjustments in social security benefits  to :Y of the inflation rate, and that our vital  Strategic Petroleum Reserve would not be  fortified. It appears as  though these and  other items located as budget cut options  represent what you consider to be the most  marginal budget components.  I realize that funding the long-delayed de tense programs and meeting the burdens  and costs  imposed by  imported oil price  hikes have contributed to difficulties in con trolling spending and the size of the budget  deficit. It is my belief, however, that had  you  assisted  the Congress  by  providing  ""honest leadership in the budgetary process  by sending to the Congress an austere, be lievable, balanced budget"" <to quote from  my earlier letter>. significant progress would  have been .within grasp. Also, when you or  your surrogates discuss  the extent of the  proposed 1981 deficit, I trust that you will  bear in mind that, while it may be 50 per cent of the on-budget deficit for fiscal year  1980, it is really only about 20 percent less  in sum than the 1980 imbalance when off budget and on-budget deficits are totalled.  That, I feel, is a more realistic comparison.  Though  few  elected officials expect  to  gain popularity through unveiling possible  budget reductions, we must confront the ad verse effects of high spending levels and  deficit budgets forthrightly. I have enclosed  a listing of areas which could be candidates  for bud~etary restraint that totals $14.56  billion. While 10 of your 36 suggested outlay  reductions are incorporated in some way in  this  listing,  the majority of  the savings  would be effected by -other .means  than  those you would recommend. It is my hope,  in providing you with this listing, that these  suggestions for budgetary scrutiny will. be  helpful as you transmit to Congre~ your re visions in budget requests and related mat ters.  Again, I am disappointed that your alter native budget plan fails to approximate the  intent of Congress in requiring it to be sub mitted. Nevertheless, I stand ready to give  my full consideration to proposals you have  made or hopefully will make which would  make some headway in controlHng budge tary excesses. We. cannot overlook the rav aging effects of inflation caused partially by  budget imbalances and the impact of the  $40 billion in additional taxes envisioned in  your budget for fiscal year 1981.  Sincerely,  TOM CORCORAN,  Representative in Congress,  15th District, fllinois.  Enclosure.

My hope  is  that the chairman of  the  Ethics Committee and the Senator from  Connecticut may come  to a  common  agreement and, if they do, I would look  forward very much indeed to supporting  that agreement.  ",1980
22,Senate,96,-0.095,196,2,Mr. HEFLIN.," First, let me thank the  distinguished Senator from Connecticut  for his kind remarks about my back ground  and  about me  personally.  I  deeply appreciate it and, hopefully, I can  measure up to the high standards and  expectations he has expressed.  Mr. President, I believe there is much  merit to many of  the suggestions and  thoughts of Senator WEICKER about the  Ethics Committee and its function, and  I  think his suggestions should be care fully considered as we attempt to seek  improvements in the Ethics Committee's  operations.  The Ethics Committee is a committee  that is bipartisan in its organization. In  its charter, it is directed to be bipartisan  and nonpolitical. Senator WALLOP is the  vice chairman, and I am the chairman  of the Ethics Committee. This commit tee is the only committee in which there  is an equal number of members from  the Democratic Party and the Republic can Party. Perhaps  the only partisan  aspect of the committee's organization  is  that the party,  the majority party,  names the chairman. The vice chairman,  of course, comes from the party that is  not in the majority. Under the charter  and the rules adopted by the committee,  the chairman cannot do many of  the  things usually reserved to the committee  chairman of other committees. In reality,  leadership of the Ethics Committee is a  joint etfort of the chairman and the vice  chairman, since they have to agree on  most matters of concern with respect to  the operation of the committee.  So, on behalf of Senator WALLOP and  myself,  I  express  support of Senator  WEICKER's propogal as modified, which  would direct  the Select Committee on  Ethics to undertake a comprehensive re view of the Senate Code of Official Con duct and the provisions for its enforce ment and implementation.  There is a basis in the committee's own  charter for a  review such as  the dis tinguished Senator  from Connecticut  proposes.  Senate Resolution  as  amended by Senate Resolution 110, the  authorizing resolution of the select com mittee, states that it shall be the duty  of the committee to recommend to the  Senate, by report or resolution, such ad ditional rules or regulations as it shall  determine to be necessary or desirable to  assure proper standards of conduct by  the Members of the Senate and by the  officers or employees of  the Senate in  the performance of their duties and the  discharge of their responsibilities.  From personal experience, I am aware  of the value that such a  review could  have to the Senate. In my position as  the chairman of Alabama's first Ethics  Commission,  I have experienced, as  I  shall elaborate a little later, a study of  ethics as applied in the public sector. I  have already expressed my own intent to  take a look at where we are today, not  only with respect to the Senate's Code  of Offi.cial Conduct and what measures  might  be  suggested  to  improve  our  ethical procedures, but also with various  other matters within  the  jurisdiction  338,  ",1980

29,Senate,96,0.377,222,2,Mr. SCHMITT.," Mr. President,  the  Cincinnati Enquirer recently published  an excellent editorial in support of Sen ate  action  to pass  a  legislative veto  amendment to the Federal Trade Com mission  <FTC). The Enquirer  rightly  points out that the Congress has dele gated its constitutional power to create  law to the FTC. Passage of a legislative  veto by a vote of 321 to 63 in the House  of Representatives is a clear signal to the  American people  that  the Congress  is  ready to reassume its responsibility.  I want to state as vigorously as pos sible  that the approval of a  legislative  veto amendment to the FTC authoriza tion bill does not mean that the Con gress  is  ready  to abandon  its goal of  protecting consumers from unfair and  deceptive  trade practices. It does not  mean  the Congress will march  to the  tune of industry lobbyists whenever one  group or another complains about a reg ulation and works to see it vetoed.  What passage of this amendment does  mean is that the elected representatives  of  the people who are elected  to pass  judgment on the law of the land will do  just that. We will no longer be able to  pass  the buck to the FTC-we will be  held accountable. This may at times be  uncomfortable, but  the authors of the  Constitution  did  not  have  our  con venience  in mind when  they drafted  that document. They wanted account ability and separation of powers. They  wanted elected representatives to write  the laws of the land.  The current authority of the FTC to  draft, enforce and adjudicate laws called  regulations does violence  to our tradi tional view  that onlv elected officials  should write the law. The legislative veto  is  a  reasonable  legislative  solution  to  this pnblem which will continue  the  delegation of authoritv to the FTC but  will place a check on its abuse by allow ing the Congress to review the final reg ulatory product.  Mr. President, I ask that the January  11 Cincinnati Enquirer editorial on the  legislative veto be printed in full at this  point.  The editorial follows:  FTC LOPSIDED VOTE SEEKS To DENY IT SOME  AUTHORITY  Congress and the nation have had it up  to here with the federal regulatory bureauc racy-best epitomized perhaps by the Fed eral Trade Commission (FTC).  That explains why the House voted 321-63  late last year to reclaim some of the con stitutional powers that an earlier Congress  had delegated to the FTC (as well as to a host  of other regulatory agencies).  What was before  the House,  specifically,  was a proposal to permit either house of Con gress to veto within 60 days any regulatory commission  ruling applicable  to an entire  industry. Unless  the veto  is overturned by  the other house of Congress, under the pro posal,  it wm remain vetoed.  House approval, of course, is only a  first  '>tep. The Senate must concur, and President  Carter must sign  the authorization b1ll  to  which the FTC restraint was attached.  But  the  lopsided House vote has  to be  regarded as something of a turning point in  the history of  the entire regulatvry move ment-and, in particular, of the entire ""con sumer"" movement.  The Constitution invests in Congress au thority  to  regulate  interstate  commerce.  Rather  than occupying  itself with all  the  questions that fall into that broad category  of concerns, Congress created the FTC-along  with similar regulators. They have acted over  the years in Congress' name.  But the emergence of a class of professional  consumers during the last decade has been a  signal for such agencies at the FTC to run  amok.  If the FTC, under  its hyperactivist  chairman, Michael Pertschuck, had had its  way, not  a  sparrow would have  fallen  to  Earth anywhere in America without the FTC's  sanction.  What the disconsolately stricken consum erists will be forgetting as they protest their  betrayal  is that the House  is elected every  two years by consumers-honest-to-goodness  consumers as distinct from those who make  their livings presuming to speak for the con suming public.

In 1952, Father McCarthy had the dis tinct honor of being ordained into the  priesthood by  the  late, much  revered  Richard Cardinal Cushing. From such  auspicious beginnings, Father McCarthy  went on to serve as a curate in St. Rose  Church  in Chelsea, Mass., before his  present assignment in Quincy.

33,House,96,0.017,235,2,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr.  Speaker,  President Carter will announce this week  whether he will ask Congress to give him  the authority to register women with the  Selective Service System.  I  am  totally  opposed  to  requiring  women  to  register with  the Selective  Service System, and  there are several  reasons.  I believe, Mr. Speaker, that this legis lation would have a hard time passing  the Congress, and I know it would have  a hard time coming out of the Committee  on Armed Services.  Our Selective Service System is in a  shambles. They can hardly register men,  and if 16 million women are also re quired to register I do not think the Se lective Service System can do the job.  Plus, I think the registering of women  really  is  the first step  toward putting  women in combat positions and combat  roles. In. the service now, Mr. Speaker, we  are gettmg an excellent group of service women. That is not what we need. We  need better men to serve. The women are  filling up the supportive slots, and they  are doing a good job.  The American people are against reg istering women, and as a man told me  in Mississippi recently when I saw him,  he said, ""I have two sons and a daughter.  01210  MEMBERS INDICTED FOR WRONG DOING  SHOULD  STEP  ASIDE  FROM SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES  UNTIL DELIBERATIONS ARE CON CLUDED  <Mr. VENTO asked and was given per mission  to  address  the House  for  1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)

This hits the  American people like a new shock wave  heaped upon the many international and  domestic problems we face today.  The interest of the American people  must come first. A Congress buffeted by  such allegations, laboring under such a  cloud, will not command  the  respect,  confidence,  and  cooperation  of  the  American people and cannot properly  exercise its responsibilities. In an effort  to be an effective public policy and de cisionmaking body, we must demand an  expedited resolution of such allegations.  A reinforced House Ethics Committee or  special assistance should be considered  to provide a  thorough, fair, and-most  importantly-a swift resolution of the  allegations.

35,,96,0.422,248,2,Mr. RUDD.," Mr. Speaker, the editor of  the Phoenix Gazette, Arizona's largest  statewide afternoon newspaper, has writ ten an excellent column on the vital im portance of congressional elections.  This is a positive statement about the  need  to elect people  to Congress who  properly represent the wishes of the peo ple to make Government work efficiently,  and to reduce the cost and size of Gov ernment at the Federal level.  I would like to include Loyal Meek's  excellent column at this point  in  the  RECORD:  [From the Phoenix Gazette, Ja.n. 30, 1980]  CONGRESSIONAL RACES DESERVE MORE  ATTENTION  (By Loyal Meek)  Presidential contests in both major parties  are getting all of the attention in the news  media.  A political decision every bit as important  to  the future of America.-namely, who  is  going to control Congress-is being virtually  ignored.  For two main reasons:  A national contest involving only one office,  one of the world's top leadership positions,  naturally attracts more attention  than a  contest involving 468 omces--435 represent atives and 33 senators-scattered through out 50 states.  Besides, it has become a foregone conclu sion that the Democrats are going to con trol Congress again. After all,  they've held  solid control of it for the last quarter of a  century and, since 1933, have yielded control  to the Republicans for only four years-194748 and 1953-54.  It woUld take a tremendous victory for the  GOP to wrest control of Congress from the  Democrats in 1980. In the House, Democrats  outnumber Republicans, 275  to 160, which  means the GOP would have to gain a whop ping 58 seats to achieve control. The odds  are more favorable in the Senate, controlled  by the Democrats, 58---41 with 1 independent;  the GOP could get control with a gain o:t  nine seats.  Despite these formidable odds, the Repub licans,  if not optimistic, are giving  them selves at least a. fighting chance.  They have been much encouraged by the  results of a national survey they had taken  by Market Opinion Research of Detroit.  It showed that the American people now  believe  that the Republican Party can do  a better job of controll1ng lnfiation and gov ernment  spending  than  the Democratic  Party.  This  represents  a  dramatic  turnaround  from 1974, when the GOP last had voter per ceptions surveyed. The poll shows that 33  percent believe the GOP can do a better job  against infia.tion, a gain of 21 percent since  1974, while only 25 percent felt the Demo cratic Party could do better, a drop of 23 per cent in the last five years.  With inflation last year hitting a rate of  13.3 percent,  the worst annual bite  in 33  years, the trends shown by these figures ap pear bound to be reinforced. Certainly Re publican leaders intend to make the most of  the Democrats' red ink record.  In a. House speech last week marking what  he called  the Democrats' ""tarnished silver  anniversary"" of congressional control, mi nority leader John Rhodes of Arizona laid it  out.  ""In 25 years,  the Democratic congresses  have spent over five trillion dollars. They have  collected four  trillion, 700 billion  in  taxes  from the American people and borrowed over  500 billion more. They have constructed a gi gantic maze of federal agencies whose regula tions have required nearly 700,000 pages to  print and which add $130 billion a year to  consumer prices.  ""In return, the American people have a tax  burden that has more than quadrupled, an  eoonomy that is strangling in bureaucracy  and a. dollar that is now worth 35 cents.""  tGood ammunition for someone contending  that it is time for a change.  Unfortunately for Republican hopes, do mestic concerns about inflation and regula tion have been upstaged by foreign concerns.  It should be noted that the national sur vey was taken between Oct. 21 and Nov. 15,  while the Iranian situwtion was heating up  and long before Afghanistan hit the fan.  Serious as  inflation  is,  the  '80 elections  may hinge more on nationa.l defense issues.  The survey commissioned by the Republicans  found  that foreign affairs/national defense  ranked near  the bottom among problems  considered  the most important, mentioned  by only 2 percent compared to 39 percent for  inflation and 21 percent for energy.  That gap no doubt has narrowed consider ably in the last month.  This may work to the advantage of Presi dent Carter, given  the public's propensity  towaro. not changing horses in the middle of  the stream. But it may be less helpful for  Democratic candidates for Congress. By and  large,  those surveyed feel  the Republicans  would do better at strengthening the mill .  ~~  Much wlll depend on which wa.y independ ent voters swing. They amount to more than  a third of the electorate, and thus hold the  balance of power.  In any event, the question of who is going  to control the 97th Congress deserves a great  deal more a-ttention than it has been get¥ing,  at least as much as th81t being given to the  presidential race.  The buck may stop at the president's desk,  but the actions that have driven down its  value below 35  cents were  taken on  the  Democr81tic-dominated Capitol Hill.  0 1310  SAN DIEGO NAVAL HOSPITAL  ",1980

40,Senate,96,0.641,339,2,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr.  President,  much has been said about the President's  state of the Union address by political  writers and political observers, but we are  just beginning to see the reaction from  the segment most affected, the profes sional military. One of the most profound  comments on this speech appeared as an  editorial in Aviation Week & Space Tech nology of January 28, written by William  H. Gregory. I ask that this interesting  article be printed in the REcORD.  The article follows:  THE CARTER GOSPEL-AS REVISED  President Jimmy Carter's State of the Un ion message sent to Congress  last week to  precede and elaborate on his State of the  Union address was a remarkable and reveal ing document. It was an obvious political  manifesto, a. carter White Paper to the na tion to lay the cornerstone of his campaign  for reelection this year.  It was far different in political salesman ship from his actual address to Congress the toughest, most spirited, rousing speech of  his presidency that was deservedly well re ceived. Both the speech and the message re flected one profound note in common-the  transfiguration of Jimmy carter from a rosy  idealist at the start of his term to something  approaching a hard-boiled realist.  Although he did not take this exact tack  in his address, he takes credit in the message  he sent to Congress for rebuilding the na tion's defense budget. Yet  here  are Mr.  Carter's words:  ""The decline in defense spending has been  reversed; defense spending has increased at  a  real rate of over 3 percent in 1979, and I  am proposing a real increase in the defense  spending level of more than 20 percent over  the next five years.""  This from the man who was promising just  after his election four years ago to cut $5-7  billion out of the defense budget when he'  took office. While he never managed to de liver on that promise, the President did kill  the Air Force B-1 bomber program as one of  his important defense decisions.  Nevertheless, those words are literally true.  The long decline in defense spending in real  terms-after discounting the effects of infla tion-is ending. President Carter is not lead ing that reversal, though. He is only follow ing. He is responding to the demands of Con gress, which arose ostensibly as a. price for  Senate approval of the SALT 2 treaty.  There was no question after his  address,  though, that the President had captured the  crest of outrage in the U.S. He talked to Con gress like a.  leader. Judging by the resound ing applause, Congress liked it when, in fact,  Congress was quicker than the President to  sense  the shifting mood of the nation on  defense, a mood that it took the seizure of  the U.S. hostages in Iran and the Soviet in vasion of Afghanistan to supply a. nucleus  for crystalization. That was the message of  the  Iowa Democratic caucuses, where  the  President beat Sen. Edward Kennedy  (D. Mass.)  two-to-one, despite the White House  imposed Soviet grain embargo that hit Mid western farmers right in the pocketbook.  President Carter's real role on defense un til now has been as a. reluctant dragon. Yet  his White Paper to Congress does not hesi tate to say that in his three years in office  his policies have been directed at three areas  of change, the first of which is:  ""The steady growth and projection abroad  of Soviet mllitary power-power  that has  grown faster  than ours over the past  two  decades."" The other two areas he cited are  the dependence of the U.S. on oil from the  Middle East and on the pressures for change  in developing nations, including the revolu tion in Iran.  Only last summer, after a still-undefined  role  in  the  fall of the Shah of Iran,  the  White House was busy  trying  to  sell  the  SALT 2 arms limitation treaty to the Sen ate. That  treaty did not satisfy critics at  either pole-those who thought it gave too  much strategic advantage to the Soviets or  those who thought it was not arms control  at all but simply a codification of an arms  race.  In the 75 pages of the State of the  Union message, there is only one key para graph devoted solely to support of SALT 2.  That is not a burial by President Carter  of his arms control dreams. But in contrast  to a dozen pages devoted to what the Ad ministration has done  to bolster U.S.  or  North Atlantic Treaty Organization defenses  and to the growing threat of the Soviet m111tary buildup, it is  lip service. SALT 2 got  even shorter shrift in the President's address,  where he shifted emphasis to a continuing  goal to control nuclear weapons but left out  even  the mild  treaty endorsement  in his  message.  That lonely reference  to SALT also con trasts with the language of the Carter mes sage on what it plainly calls ""the Soviet at tack on Afghanistan and the ruthless exter mination of  its government."" Its language  leaves little doubt that the Afghanistan in vasion was what shocked President Carter  into sounding like a veritable firebrand on  defense. Nevertheless, it proposed the most  realistic language of the message:  ""The destruction of the independence of  the Afghanistan government and the occu pation by the Soviet Union has altered the  strategic situation in that part of the world  in a very ominous fashion. It has brought the  Soviet Union within striking distance of the  Indian Ocean and even the Persian Gulf. It  has eliminated a buffer between the Soviet  Union and Pakistan and presented a new  threat to Iran. These two countries are now  far more vulnerable to Soviet political  intimidation.  If  that  intimidation were  to  prove effective, the Soviet Union might well  control an area of vital strategic and eco nomic significance to the survival of Western  Europe,  the Far East and ultimately  the  United States.""  In his subsequent address,  the President  built on that assessment to deliver the most  significant pronouncement of the new Jimmy  Carter: That any assault on vital interests of  the u.s. in the Persian Gulf wm be met, if  necessary,  by  force. When  the  initial en thusiasm wanes, as  it will,  the  test wlll  come  in how well earlier Carter Adminis tration budgets and m111tary decisions and  the promised  future  increases  in Defense  funding will back up these tough words from  the transfigured President.e  AMBASSADOR  GEORGE  KENNAN  CALLS FOR REALISM, PRUDENCE,  AND RESTRAINT  IN AMERICAN  STATESMANSHIP  e Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, Am bassador George Kennan  is America's  most  experienced  and  knowledgeable  diplomat  in dealing with  the Soviet  Union. As the original author of the con tainment doctrine, he provided the intel lectual framework for an entire period  of American policy  toward  the Soviet  Union. It would be wise,  therefore, to  heed the concerns of Dr. Kennan about  the administration's response to the So viet invasion of Afghanistan. Dr. Kennan  clearly states, and I agree, that the So viet intervention is unacceptable to the  world community. But he also notes a  disquieting lack of balance in the analy sis and response to Afghanistan which  has led to a militarization of thought in  Washington. He finds a war atmosphere  in Washington which is obstructing our  efforts to develop a realistic policy based  on political as well as military responses  and which takes into account the local  as well as the global factors.  I am sobered by Dr. Kennan's warn ing:  we are now in a danger zone. I can think  of no  instance  in modern history where  such a breakdown of politic~l communica tion and such a  triumph of unrestrained  m111ta.ry  suspicions as now marks Soviet American relations has not led, in the end,  to armed conflict.  Mr.  President, Dr. Kennan's wise  counsel should be considered by all of  us in the Senate as we began to examine  specific policy proposals to respond to  the new situation created by the Soviet  invasion of Afghanistan. I ask to insert  Dr. Kennan's article from the New York  Times of February 1, 1980, in the RECORD.  The text of the article follows:  GEORGE F. KENNAN, ON WASHINGTON'S RE ACTION TO THE AFGHAN CRISIS:  ""WAS THIS  REALLY MATURE STATESMANSHIP?""  PRINCETON, N.J.-On Christmas Day 1979,  after more than a century of periodic  in volvement with  the internal affairs of  its  turbulent neighbor, and after many months  of futile effort to find a pro-Soviet Afghan  figure ca.pable of. running the country, the  Soviet Government suddenly expanded what  was a:lready a sizeable military involvement  in Afghanistan into a  full-fledged occupa tion, promising that the troops would leave  when their limited mission had been accom plished.

Twenty years . ago we  started  this  crusade  provide  essential  relief  from aircraft noise  for communities  surrounding  our Nation's  airports.  Three  years  ago  these  regu1ations  became a reality. FAR part 36 is long  past the debate stage. Having been the  subject  of  countless  congressional  hearings and one of the Federal A vi ation Administration's most intensive  and  comprehensive  regulatory  pro ceedings, the time has come for imple mentation without hesitation or ex ception. The report we are considering  today will set this cause back beyond  redemption.  Compromise may well be the mark  of reasonable men, and my colle.agues  know that I am not an unreasonable  man. I have always been sensitive to  the needs of the aircraft industry, par ticularly in light. of the fact that ~t is  the single largest industry in my home  area. In this instance, however, I am  convinced  that my constituents are  long overdue in their entitlement to  some relief from aircraft noise, as I am  also convinced that the industry will  not suffer unduly in Qteeting the cur rent approved phased in requirements.  It is time for us all to face-up to the  commitments made to the people. If  we do not reject this report, it is they  who will be compromised.e  U.S. MILITARY SPENDING ANOTHER VIEW  HON. FORTNEY H.

43,Senate,96,-0.355,391,2,Mr. SASSER.," Mr.' President, I  intro duce this amendment on behalf of my self  and my  distinguished  colleagues  Senators  JAVITS, MOYNIHAN, . TSONrtAS,  BOREN, WILLIAMS, BRADLEY, LEVIN, BAKER,  HATCH, and STONE.  Mr. President over the last 10 years,  we have experienced, I think, a matura tion of a truly national air travel sys tem. We have seen the development of  airports  and  air  passenger  facilities  which are unparalleled  in our history  and, I suppose, unparalleled anywhere  in the world.  In one short decade, we have seen  safer, cleaner, more attractive and far  more comfortable and more convenient  passenger  terminal  facilities  emerge  from a previous circumstance  that, in  far  too many  cases,  included  over crowded,  dirty, ugly,  unpleasant, and  drafty airport terminals.  The ADAP program was adopted  to  assist local airports with much needed  capital development programs. Before its  inception, in far too many cases, local  airports were dependent upon revenues  from the general tax base of their locali ties to provide airport improvements.  At least one  thing has been learned  by the pre-ADAP experience: it is pat ently unfair to place the burden of air port improvement upon homeowners and  other property owners through the col lection of general property taxes for that  purpose. That burden has been right fully borne during the last 10 years by  the air travelers through the collection  of  the air passenger tax and through  collection of various user fees from the  air carriers.  During that same decade, air travel  has burgeoned beyond anyone's expecta tion. No doubt, the very improvements  made possible  through ADAP contrib uted substantially to the growing popu larity of commercial air travel. Hence, as  traffic has increased, the need for capital  improvement has increased as well. Air port  facilities  completed  in  the early  seventies are now overburdened by the  volume of 1980 air travel.  Why then, are we being urged to aban don a program that has enjoyed such  unqualified success?  Why must we abandon a successful  program at a time when there is a grow ing need to retain it?  The incentive, we are told, is ""defeder alization."" Defederalization has become  one of those magic buzz words which goes  along so well with the wave of popular  abhorrence  for  big Government  and  widespread resistance to Government in terference in business.  Mr. President, I feel that and I think  the majority of the Members of this body  share that opinion. This debate, we are  told by the proponents of S. 1648, ""cen ters on the concern of whether or not  multimillion dollar businesses which are  all capable of profitable enterprise should  continue  receive  'airport welfare'  from the Federal Government.""  I say to my colleague that is simply  not the case.  The simple truth is that our Nation's  airports are not profitmaking enterprises,  and were never intended to be. The proto  ponents of this bill, I think, distinguished  and able Senators, know that as well as  I do. As a matter of fact, they went to  great  length  last Thursday  to  rush  through so-called technical amendments  that prohibits just that eventuality.  No, our airports are not profitmaking  enterprises, as contrasted with our com mercial airlines, which are. Rather, they  are publicly owned and controlled instru ments of  local governments,  their sole  responsibility  is  to the public  interest,  convenience, and necessity.  The airline  industry, on  the other  hand, is solely responsible to its stock holders. Once, we undertook to impose a  standard of public interest, convenience,  and necessity upon the carriers.  Then I think we made a great mistake.  Any further hope for that dream of im posing the public interest and conven ience and necessity in place of the profit  motive, I think, evaporated with the so called airline deregulation bill. At the  time the deregulation bill came up, that  was also a popular buzz word. Indeed, I  remind the Senate that deregulation was  brought to us under the same auspices  that now want to defederalize.  Having enjoyed the benefits of deregu lation for a time now, we know what that  means. For Knoxville and Chattanooga,  Tenn.,  it means service abandonment,  curtailed  and  inconvenient  schedules,  and higher fares. Does my memory fail  me when I remember promises of lower  fares and better service? Perhaps, but  now I know the complete definition of  deregulation. It simply means that air line companies, given  the opportunity,  will maximize their profits to the hilt.  Why, then, should we expect the airline  companies to respond any differently to  ""defederalization""? The simple truth is,  .we cannot. Once again, the name of the  game will be ""maximize profits."" After  all-that is the bottom line of why the  airlines are in business.  Mr. JA VITS. Mr. President, will  Senator yield at that point?  ",1980
44,Senate,96,0.391,404,2,Mr. THURMOND.," I am pleased to rise  in support of the Airport and Airway De velopment Act as reported by the Com mittee on Commerce, Science, and Trans portation.  Mr. President, this legislation, by de federalizing the Nation's 72  largest air ports, represents the logical second step  in our ongoing plan to deregulate the air line industry.  Defederalization will  allow  airport  management to take a more active role  in contractual negotiations with the air  carriers. At the same time, this legisla tion will allow the smaller, regional air ports  to receive adequate funding  for  necessary improvements to insure greater  passenger safety.  Mr. President, while I support the de federalization concept, I urge that the  Commerce Committee take a careful look  at the need for repeal of the present pro hibition on the user head tax. I am well  aware of  the potential problems reim position of this tax may create, but, I am  concerned that those airports which no  longer will receive ADAP  funds  in the  future are afforded a method of generat ing adequate revenues to maintain their  present and future operations.  Mr. President, I would  like  to com mend my distinguished colleagues, Sen ator CANNON from Nevada, Senator PAcK wooD from Oregon, and the other mem bers of  the Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation,  for  their  work on this legislation, and I hope that  my colleagues in the Senate will support  the committee's recommendations.  SECTION 23 <a> OF S. 1648  in  Packwood amendment as adopted by the  Senate. I want to personally assure the  Senator from Alabama that the Aviation  Subcommittee will  hold  hearings  9  months after enactment of this legisla tion, and if the final law includes the  mandatory exclusion of Birmingham, the  subcommittee will specifically examine  the financial capabilities, safety needs,  and capacity needs of Birmingham Air port. We shall give  the same kind of  specific scrutiny to any unique airport  situation and find a remedy, legislative if  necessary, to see that real and important  needs do not go unmet.  I assure the Senator of this examina tion and action if necessary.  ",1980
45,Senate,96,0.287,404,2,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President, I ap preciate the opportunity to comment on  the Airport and Airway Development  Act, S. 1648. As a  former member of  the Subcommittee on Aviation of  the  House Committee on Public Works and  Transportation,  I can fully appreciate  the work the committee has done in get ting this bill  to the floor.  I support the bill, and I am especial ly pleased the funds now available in the  trust fund will be fully utilized over the  next several years to develop needed air port projects around the country. The  discretionary funds  that will be made  available  are  greatly  needed  the  Southern region.  However,  I  would  appreciate  the  chairman's comments on a problem that  has been brought to my attention under  the existing system of allocating funds  based on the priority assigned to proj ects in a given region. Obviously, some  sort of priority system  is necessary  if  we are to have orderly development proj ects to insure safety and expanded serv ice for air travelers. However, during the  past 4 years,  I have worked with  the  sponsors of an airport project in north  Mississippi, and the problems encoun tered in obtaining the necessary funds  for this project point up the need for  some changes in the priority system.  The project in question has received  approximately $3.4 million from the Fed eral Government,  and  local  interests  through a bond issue have provided al most $2 million. These funds have been  expended on street relocation,  runway  site preparation, and excavation. Work  has now stopped. When completed the  airport will be able to provide jet serv ice to the community. However, to pro vide this service an additional $4.4 mil lion will be needed. It should be pointed  out that these additional funds would  only provide minimum facilities for air  carrier service.  The most recent assignment of priori ties by the FAA, which is an improve ment over previous ones for this proj ect, still leaves the project with very little  hope of fiscal year 1980 discretionary  funds. If so,  this would be the second  year in the past five in which these funds  were not provided. As a result, this proj ect will continue  to be delaved while  construction costs escalate with  infla tion.  My concern  is that there should be  some priority given  to  those projects  which are partially completed ahead of  other projects with a region which are   ",1980

Mr. Chairman, I wish to commend the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.  ERTEL)  and  the  two gentlemen  from  Indiana for working out this provision.  They have had a most difficult situa tion and have labored long and hard to  reach an agreement.  I have no objection to the amendment.  It meets the requirements, and I hope  the subst;tute is adopted.  ",1980
53,,96,-0.023,495,2,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike  the  requisite number of words,  and  I  rise  in support of  the Fithian  amendment. This amendment proposes  to deauthorize several costly and unnec essary water projects and includes lan guage  pertaining  to  the Northfield Millers Rivers diversion proposals for the  Connecticut River.  I should like to first address myself to  this latter issue. On December 8, 1979,  the Assistant Secretary of the Army for  Civil Works, Mike Blumenfeld, sent a  letter to the Office of Management and  Budget stating that it was his determi nation after careful study of the matter  not to recommend proceeding any fur ther with the Northfield-Millers Rivers  diversion proposal. Secretary Blumen feld stated that there was no State sup port for the project and that upon re view of the Chief of Engineers' report,  he had not found the project to be su perior  to other alternatives. The  lan guage in this amendment reaffirms the  decision of Mr. Blumenfeld for the corps  by specifically providing no authorization  for any additional work on the project.  Mr. Chairman, I believe my past record  with regard to the funding of water re sources projects demonstrates my very  real concern over  the misdirection of  Federal policies  in  this area. I whole heartedly  supported  the  President's  water policy reforms which I felt added  a welcomed degree of rationality to the  decisionmaking process. I deeply regret  that this water resources bill does not  incorporate most of these water policy  reforms.  A number of my colleagues who also  support the Fithian amendment have al ready listed a number of reasons why  the particular projects  listed  in  this  amendment should be deauthorized.  I  will not repeat what has already been  said. I would like to point out, however,  that this amendment is unique because  we have not only chosen these projects  for deauthorization after careful anal ysis of their environmental and econom ic feasibility but, lo and behold,  these  projects are also opposed by the Mem bers in whose districts they fall.  During the debate on the energy and  water appropriations bill last year there  was lively debate here in the House over  amendments to delete funding for cer tain projects. At that time many Mem bers of this body took pains to point out  that the opinion of Members in whose  districts projects were located should be  given considerable weight  in  the final  determinations. You may recall the crea tion of the Finocchio Award by one of  our esteemed colleagues who suggested  this award should be  issued  to  those  Members who put their nose in other  people's districts when it does not con cern them. If this is the basis on ~vhich  many Members are making decisions on  these amendments,  then  for heaven's  sake,  let us be consistent.  I would also like to recall to Members  of this Chamber that during the energy  and water appropriations bill debate, it  was suggested by one Member that those  who opposed funding of projects should  have stepped forward with a bill to de authorize the projects rather than ,vait ing for the appropriations process. Well  here we are. We have accepted your  criticism. We have  taken your advice.  Now we ask for your support.  ",1980

55,,96,0.236,495,2,Mr. MYERS of Indiana.," Mr. Chair man, I move to strike the last word and  rise in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman,  I,  too,  join my col leagues  in commending  the gentleman  from Pennsylvania <Mr. ERTEL)  in his  efforts and his success, apparently,  in  compromising here. This is a question  where really there can be no winners.  I am sure my colleague from Indiana  is not completely satisfied with this lan guage, nor am I really satisfied. I think  we all have our own views.  The thing that has concerned me with  action by  this body  to strike projects  without due consideration is the fact that  several years ago this committee taught  me a  lesson. When I came down here  as a young Member, I decided there was  a project that needed to be built. Now,  this project had not gone through the  study process and the planning process,  so I thought it should be authorized and  I introduced it as an amendment to an  omnibus public works bill. The commit tee, very appropriately, and very right fully, beat the dickens out of me and  proved that I was wrong in using this  procedure  on  the  House  :floor  to  authorize.  Correspondingly, I believe it is just as  wrong  to use  this  procedure  to  de authorize.  I know nothing about  the  other 18 projects. For that reason I am  accepting this compromise. But the thing  that deeply concerns me is what the Un der Secretary of the Army, Mr. Blumen feld and the Chief of the Army Corps  of Engineers said when they appeared  before our subcommittee this morning.  The Chief of the Army Corps of Engi neers said this: The people of the United  States have been saved in flood damages  this past year almost $20 billion. Almost  $20 billion in 1 year was saved in flood  damages that could have occurred had  there not been in place the flood control  measures already enacted by this Con gress in past years. The startling fact is  how  little the country has invested in  :flood protection in the past, the cumula tive amount for all of the years amounts  to slightly over $18 billion. To say that  these are wastes and, every once in a  while, in a snide way some call them pork  barrel, when they returned more than  the  total  investment  in  total  for 200  years, is something we should all keep in  mind.  Now, most of us hope to be around in  the year 2000 when it is projected that  our country's population will be some thing near 300 million. It has already  been projected that this country of 300  million is going to need about twice as  much water as it has available today.  Yet we say we do not want to provide  water for the future.  That is the same kind of judgment and  thinking which has given us the energy  problem we flnd our country in today.  We can import more energy, we can im port oil from abroad. Maybe we cannot  get as much as we would like to. But  where can we import water from?  Most of us at the year 2000 expect to  be grandparents, or maybe even great  grandparents. When  that  little  tyke  crawls up in our lap and says ""Grandpa,  grandma, was it really true that when  you were a little boy or little girl that you  could flush the stool more than once a  day; is it really true that you could take  a shower or a bath anytime you wanted;  was it really true that you could even  water the lawn or wash your automobile;  if you had an abundance of water like  that, what happened  to  it,  grandpa,  grandma"";  then what are you going to  say to that child?

57,,96,-0.313,508,2,Mr. SMITH of Iowa.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I have listened through out the several days that this bill has been  on the fioor, and I am somewhat disappointed at some of the things I have read  and heard concerning the bill.  I think at this juncture, as we are fin ishing up the bill, it might be a good time  for me to mention a few things I believe  should be considered.  We hear a lot about the environment.  Every Member of this House is concerned  about the environment. We will have dif ferences of opinion as to what should be  done to preserve and enhance the envi ronment, but I give credit to everybody  on both sides of the debate. Everybody  wants to consider the environment, but I  think some have not considered what  this bill does  to  improve  the environ ment.  One of the principal reasons we need  such a bill as this is because the develop ment and urbanization and the increase  in population  in  this country has as saulted the environment for 300 years. We  are assaulting it day after day and year  after year through legislation and pro grams for new storm sewer systems which  carry runoff water to the river instead of  hold it back in a basin. The environment  is assaulted through a number of other  pieces of legislationunder which there is  no requirement that benefits exceed costs  as is the case in this bill, and in legisla tion under which there is no considera tion for all of the procedures cooperating  with wildlife authorities and others which  the committee reporting this bill must go  through before it can approve or recom mend one of these projects.  Many years ago when my ancestors  landed at Plymouth Rock, there were only  1 million people  in  this country,  just  1 million in what is r.ow the mainland  United States. The various forms of life  had developed over a period of centuries  to what we call a balance of nature.  One million people could be absorbed,  there were all kinds of predators, birds,  insects, plants, and other forms of life.  When one form of life reproduced in sur plus to its share, another form was en couraged to expand until it devoured the  excess. The streams ran clear and the  rain fell up plant life and earth which  absorbed it.  But now we have 220 million people.  That huge  increase  in population  re quired major adjustments  in  the en vironment. Land was cleared for agricul ture so more food for humans could be  raised, plants and animal  life which  competes with man was reduced or eli minated urban  areas were  developed  which drained the land and increased  the volume poured into the river. Parking  lots and buildings are being built every  day.  The water  that falls on  top of  the  buildings does not go into the ground.  It goes into a sewer system that we help  pay for with Federal money, goes right  down to the river with dirt and pollu tion and swells the river, and that causes  greater  floods. When more and more  water is poured into a river, the fiood  plain is assaulted and hardwood existing  above the edge of the fiood plain experi ence wet feet, that kills them and. they  are replaced with plants that can with stand water.  So what we have done is to assault the  environment over a period of time, but  ",1980

Jn the months ahead  I am sure there will be ample ooportunit~  for all of us to exoress our tribute to his  extraordinary achievements, but at this  time I would like briefly to express my  appreciation for his 26 years of service  in the House, a record of intelligent and  fearlessly outspoken  independence and  crusading concern for the consumer.  But more importantly, I would like to  share with my colleagues  the gentle man's statement announcing his deci sion not to seek reelection. That state ment is an eloquent expression of  the  gentleman's commitment to the highest  level of integrity and decency in public  service. It is a perceptive comment on  the need for major reform of the conduct  of political campaign and an argument  for public financing and the best that I  have seen on that subject.  The statement follows:  STATEMENT  OF  CONGRESSMAN  CHARLES  A.  VANIK, JANUARY 30, 1980, AT A PRESS CON FERENCE  IN CLEVELAND, OHIO  Congressman Charles A. Vanlk of the 22nd  District of Ohio today announced that he  will not seek election to the 97th Congress.  Representative Vanlk was first elected to the  Congress from the 21st District of Ohio in  1954. In 1968, he gave up his 21st Congres sional seat to run for Congress from the 22nd  District of Ohio. Currently, Mr. Vanlk serves  on the Ways and Means Committee and is  Chairman of the Trade Subcommittee:  Congressman Vanik stated:  ""My decision is not based on any concern  about reelection. In 1978 I was elected by a  margin of 66 percent. In the past three elec tions,  I was reelected without raising any  campaign  funds or making campaign ex penditures. My voting record and my walking  shoes were my entire cainpalgn.  ""Today my supporters advise that it wm  be necessary for me to return to cainpalgn  financing. My determination not to use cain paign  funds overwhelms my desire  to  re main  in office. Seldom  are  contributions  made without a political debt or mortgage.  I have become accustomed to a high degree  of political freedom, which should be made  available  to  every member  of Congress  through public financing. This is particularly  important since public financing of presi dential  elections has  increased  the pres sures on Congress and diverted the flow of  special  interest campaign resources  to  the  Congress. Objective judgment on public is sues are hard to come by under such tre mendous pressure.  ""Instead of campaigning for reelection, I  would like to spend my total time solving  problems through the legislative process. I  believe that I can do more in eleven months  of hard work than I can in two years of the  next term.  ""It distresses me  that  the campaign of  1980 began Labor Day 1979. The political de mands on time have put needed legislation  and important decisions on the back burner.  For the good of the nation,  the campaign  period should be shortened, limited to the  pe~lod between May and November.  For twenty-five years, I have fought an  uph111 battle for tax justice. Until the Con gress is released from its contribution com mitments, there is little hope that the heavy  burden of taxation wm be lifted from the  individual in a more equitable manner. The  oil windfall tax is a case in point. The Presi dent and the Congress have accepted a rev enue level $100 billion less than it ought to  be. The result is a victory for everyone but  the people.  ""There  is often  talk about  limiting the  terms of Congressmen. From my vantage  point, Congress needs experience and mem ory as much as it needs new blood. Under  the present system, we are creating a  re volving door Congress which has little sta b111ty or courage.

62,House,96,-0.007,534,2,Mr. HUTTO.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  call your attention, and that of my col leagues,  to a  recent  record dive per formed by the U.S. Navy at the Naval  Experimental Diving Unit  (NEDU)  lo cated in my district.  The dedicated naval personnel located  at the Navy Coastal Systems Center in  Panama City,  Fla.,  established  their  place in the record books with Deep Dive  79,  a  deep saturation dive mission  in  which six U.S. Navy saturation divers  reached  the equivalent depth of 1,800  feet of seawater <FSW). The NEDU was  the first to successfully put divers in the  water at 1,800 FSW to perform meaning ful work for 5 days. This unprecedented  action is a major breakthrough in under standing the effects of deep dives and  man's ability  to cope with  them. The  previous deep dive was accomplished by  our allies, the French, in 1977 to a depth  of 1,644 FSW for a period of 10 minutes.  At that time, the purpose was to demon strate practical underwater oilfield work  at great depths. The implications for fu ture ""harvesting"" of the sea are obvious.  The dive  took place  in  the NEDU's  ocean simulating  facility,  the world's  largest  and most  sophisticated man rated hyperbaric chamber complex. The  dive commenced on November 6, 1979,  and was  completed on December  13,  1979. The extra 32 days of dive time were  necessary, Mr. Speaker, to allow for 12  days of compression to 1,800 FSW and  20 days of decompression back  to the  surface. During  this period  the divers  resided  in  the NEDU complex, which  consists of a 55,000-gallon wet chamber  interconnected with six dry living/work~  ing chambers totaling 3,076 cubic feet of  space. This complex allowed the divers  some freedom of movement during their  37 days of  isolation from  the outside  world.  The dive team consisted of the follow ing personnel:  HMCS <DV) Thomas ""Boxy"" Holmes  Dive team leader);  Lt. Claude Piantadosi, MC;  HMCM <DV) Lowell ""Bo"" Burwell;  BM1 <DV) John Paul Johnston;  EM1 <DV> Thomas ""Tuck"" Ostertag  and  '  BTl <DV) Larry Siemiet.  Mr. Speaker, I want to especially note  that Senior Chief Holmes holds the un precedented distinction of having reen listed-for 4 years-at 1,800 FSW. The  reenlistment ceremony was held on No vember 21, 1979, with the oath being ad ministered by Lieutenant Piantadosi.  My sincere congratulations and thanks  go to these brave and dedicated individ uals.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  ",1980
63,House,96,0.269,547,2,Mr. BROYHILL.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is  with a note of melancholy and sadness  that I mark the passing of Ray Garrett,  former Chairman of the Securities and  Exchange Commission. He was a treas ured friend and a dedicated public ser vant. Ray was a brilliant attorney, a true  gentleman, and a man of great accomp lishment. At the age of 59, he leaves us  before his time. He made things happen;  everyone loved him.  As Chairman of  the SEC, he was a  tower of strength, yet still knew  the  meaning of restraint. His whole life was  an inspiration. Briefly, I would like  to  acquaint my colleagues with the career  of Ray Garrett.  He was born on August 11, 1920, in  Chicago, Ill. In 1941, he was graduated  from Yale University and he received his  LL.B. from Harvard Law School in 1949.  Immediately prior to joining the Com mission as Chairman, Mr. Garrett was a  partner in the Chicago law ftrm of Gard ner, Carton, Douglas, Children,  and  Waud where he had been since 1958.  From 1954 to 1958, he was on the staff of  the Securities and Exchange Commis sion, serving for most of that period as  Director of  the Division of Corporate  Regulation.  In 11965, Mr. Garrett was chairman of  the section of corporation banking and  business law of the American Bar Asso ciation and has also served as chairman  of the ABA Committee on Developments  in Corporate Financing. He was chair man of the advisory committee for the  corporate department :financing project  of  the American Bar Foundation,  a  member of  the board of editors of the  American Bar Association Journal, and  consultant to the ""Reporter"" for codifi cation of Federal securities laws project  of the American Law Institute.  Prior to joining the SEC staff, he was  a  teaching  fellow  at Harvard  Law  School and assistant professor of law at  New York University. For several years  he was a visiting lecturer at the North western University School of Law. Mr.  Garrett was sworn in as Chairman of the  Securities and Exchange Commission on  August 6, 1973. In 1975 he returned to  the private practice of law. Even in the  private sector, he continued his public  service by giving unselfishly of his time  to serve on advisory committees, educa tional seminars and wrote authoritative  articles in his :field.  Ray is survived by his wife Virginia,  three daughters, one son, and six grand children.  I wish to express my condolences to  Ray Garrett's family. Their loss is our  loss. Ray will always be remembered and  always  loved by  those who knew and  worked with him.e  TESTIMONY OF HON.  JA:MES  T.

OF PARENTS  SUMliiARY OF THE PROBLEM  American  laws setting the requirements  which must be met by citizens having chil-  dren abroad so that the child can be an  American citizen at birth make a distinction  between those who are abroad as employees  of the U.S. Government, or of International  Organizations, and those who are not at tached to the Government \n any way. The  distinction gives significant benefits to the  first group, and denies these benefits to the  second.  ACA'S QUESTION  When. it comes. to qualifying to transmit  citizenship to children born abroad, why are  some Americans given greater privileges  than others?

'the President,  thus,  justifies  the exist ence of two different classes of Americans  abroad, one with more rights than another.  However, he further states: ""The enactment  of the legislation liberalizing the general re quirements for transmission' of. citizenship,  as cited in Section I. of this report <see Issue  4 above>, would significantly lessen the dif ference in treatment between thpse abroad  who are in the service of the U.S. Govern ment or  international-organizations and  other Americans living abroad."" Subsequent  to such recommended action the distinction  would remain, but would be of lesser import.  ACN'S RENEWED QUESTION  Does th-e President really feel that there  is a need  to make a distinction between  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  February 5, 1980  Americans living overseas in terms of their  ability to transmit basic Human Rights to.  their children simply because of diff-erent.  kinds-of employers of Americans abroad?  The President stated that the Congress, in  making such a  legislative distinction, was  carrying out a  'legitimate purpose on a  sound basis. Doubtless good  reasons can  always be found for almost any action taken  by the 'congress. But tliat is not the point.  The point is whether such a distinction is  necessary, and whether it is right.  A clue to the President's thinking is given  in the use of the word ""voluntary"" in justi fying the distinction made between Govern ment employees and those not working for  the Government. Presumbly  this  implies  that only Government employees are sent  abroad by their employers without choice.  This would come as a surprise to many em ployees of major corporations who have also  been sent overseas. Of course these private  sector Americans could always refuse to go  abroad. They could quit  their  jobs. But,  then again so could most of the Govern ment employees. The issue of voiuntariness  as a justification for this distinction would  not seem a valid example~  It might be argued that employees of the  Government are.-working for the good of  the country while the private sector Ameri cans are only out for their own ~elfish inter ests. This, in most cases, would also be hard  to justify. Indeed, it is often not clear who is  making the most important contribution to  the health and welfare of the United States,  the clerk at an Embassy or a prominent  American professor,  lawyer, doctor, engi neer,  consultant, . poet or architect. The  point really is that the United States should  not be in the business of making such curious  value; value  judgments of  the worth or  contributions being m~e bY  its overseas  citizens. Yet, any other basis for making dis tinctions , between how different classes of  overseas Anlericans  should be  treated  is  hard to find.  ACA would like to ask the President to ad dress the question of whether some overseas  Americans should have more privileges than  others? If so, how is such differential' treat ment to be justified? Explanations given to  date are quite evidently  inadequate. All  Americans should be equal before the law.  Or have we missed something?  ISSUE  NUMBER  6-RETROACTIVITY  OF  THE  REvOCATION  OF  CITIZENSHIP  RETENTION:  REQUIREMENTS  sUMMARY oF THE PROBLEM  In 1978,  the Congress  finally abolished  the requirement that children born abroad  with American citizenship in families where  only one parent was an 'American citizen  had to return tb the United states for a  specified period , of  subsequent  residence  failing which the child automatically lost  his American citizenship on a given birthday.  When this change was made, the Congress  failed  to make  the  change  retroactive.  Hence some children who were born abroad  have been stripped of their American citizenship far failure to comply with requirements than no longer exist.  ACA's QUESTION  Why, if the congress recognizes that conditions subsequent for the retention of' citizenship acquired at birth abroad are wrong,  should not the revocation of this abandoned  principle apply equally to those previously  struck by its inequity as to those fortunate  enough to still be too young to have been  assaulted by it?  THE PRESIDEN':f'S REPLY  ""There are no longer any provisions of law  which discriminate  against' citizens born.  abroad with respect to retention or loss of  citiZenship. During the hearings on the bill,  Congress  considered  arguments  for  and  against retroactive repeal of Section 301 <b>  <which had previously required the subse quent residency as a condition of retaining  citizenship if acquired at birth abroad), and  found sufficient r-easons for repealing the  statute prospectively only. The arguments  against retroactive repeal were grounded on  difficulties, legal and administrative, inher ent in restoring citizenship status to persons  who have previously  lost  it, and  in  the  ''ripple effect"" that such action would have  on derivative citizenship claims, tax obliga tions, and social security benefits. Reconsid eration of .this matter has resulted in the  conclusion that the Administration should  not seek a revision in the recent legislation  enacted by the Congress.""  When the changes to Section 301 <b> were  being discussed by the Administration and  the relevant Members of the Congress, the  Administration  took . a  strong position  in  favor of making the revocation of the reten tion requirements retroactive. There were  good reasons for doing this. First, there was  a  relevant  historical  tJrecedent.  Earlier,  when  the  subsequent  residency  require ments had been made  less draconian  in  1952,  the Government  initially  opposed  retroactivity and then reversed  itself and  argued in the Fedetal Courts that retroactiv ity: should be used. Children that had been  stripped of their failure to comply with pre vious requirements were restored to their .  citiZenship status, problems of administra tion, and ripples, notwithstanding.  Second, the Administration had a strong  argument to the effect that the size of the  potential  complications  issue was  small.  After all, only a modest number of children  had been abused by the old law and most of  these were not necessarily old enough to  ba.ve bad large families for derived citizen ship complications,. and surely none was yet   old enough to have social security retire ment problems. Indee~ according  to  the  State Department, we were only  talking  about 2,000 people.  Additionally, while there would be a need  to adoot new administrative orocedures to  handle the retroactivity processing, State  had  just been  relieved  from  the  large  burden of having to chase after children  born abroad to take their citizenship awaY  from them and thus there was a net freeing  of administrative capacity in any case.  ACA:'s RENEWED QUESTION \  ACA is most disappointed by the change   in the Administration's stand on this issue.  From being a strong defender of overseas  Americans in 1978, the Administration has  abandoned the disinherited children abroad.  Now the Administration cites the very.argu ments to justify this new polic~ that it had  so. effectively shown  to. be without sub. stance only one year earlier.  ACA asks once again, why is the Administration abandoning the 2;000 citizens who  have been stripped of their American citizenship under provisions of a  law that is  now recognized to have been unjust? Surely,  if justice has any meaning, it must be worth  some small administrative inconvenience to  be rendered ..     We ask  the President 'to reconsider his  new policy and not abandon the 2,000 disinherited innocents abroad.e    ",1980
65,,96,-0.264,573,2,Mr. WOLFF.," Mr. Speaker, on Fel).  ruary 4,  the Republic of Sri Lanka  celebrated the 32d anniversary of its  independence from Great Britain. Last  August, a delegation to Asia -led by the  Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific  Affairs visited Sri Lanka where it was  our pleasure  to meet with that na tion's leaders and observe several de  velopment projects. Along with my  colleagues  the delegation. 1 am  deeply impressed with the dedication,  ~telligence, and foresight of President  Javawardene  and his cabinet as they  chart their nation's future.    Sri Lanka is today a model for devel oping nations. Life expectancy and per  capita  food  consumption  have  in  creased dramatically during the past  25 years while the rates of population  growth and infant mortality have de clined. In addition, the nation's econo my  has  achieved  impressive  and  consistent growth rates which, in spite  of  the present worldwide  economic  stagnation, will probably remain above  6 percent for the next several years.  As a leading voice among the devel  oping nations, Sri Lanka's position has  been  one  of  true  nonalinement.  During the Conference of Nonalined  Heads of Government held in Havana  last  .year,  the delegation  from Sri  Lanka consistently sought to maintain  the founding principles of the nona  lined movement and  it always has .  been an advocate of moderation and  restraint in the resolution of tntema  tional differences.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Concern for the rights of citizens in  Sri Lanka is reflected in the nation's  new constitution which insures equali  ty before the law for all citizens and  gives special attention to the needs of  the Tamil-speaking minority. Tamil  government offices and law courts are  being maintained and, along with Sin hala, Tamil has been declared a na tional language. These are fundamen tal measures that are essential to re solving the historic grievances of the  Tamil people.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is my pleasure  bring  to  the attention of our  leagues  the commendable goals and  outstanding accomplishments of Sri  Lanka. I extend to the people of Sri  Lanka my warmest congratulations on  the 3.2d anniversary of the founding of  their nation.e  col~  to  .THE WHITE HOUSE CONFER ENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS  HON. THOMAS B. EVANS, JR.  OF DELAWARE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 5, 1980  e ",1980
66,,96,0.178,573,2,Mr. EVANS of Delaware.," Mr. Speak er,  the White House Conference on  Small Business recently concluded its  meeting  here  in Washington  and  is8ued a  list of 60  recommendations  which will serve as the basis for a final  report  from  the Conference  to  the  President  and  the Congress.  This  report is expected to be completed in  approximately 2 months. Fortunately.  the 1,573 delegates to the Conference  designated 15 of the 60 recommenda tions as priority items.  Due to public and congressional. in  terest tn these recommendations, I am  attaching the priority items for  the  consideration of my colleagues. The  primary areas of concern identified by  the Conference center around  infla  tion, excesSive Government spending,  unreasonabie regulations, and the con  fiscatory level of taxation. The collec  tive message  from  the Conference  seems to be ""Get the Government off  our backs and out of our pockets!""  Based on the firsthand reports l re ceived from .the members of the Dela ware delegation to the Conference, I  believe the final report should serve as  the catalyst for congressional action to  relieve small businesses from the big  problems-....they are now  facing. The  men and women  involved  in  small  business operations face a unique set  of difficulties today. I intend to con  tinue my efforts to enact a broad tax  relief and regulatory reform package  which will strengthen the role of small  business as the backbone of our econ  omy.  The recommendations of  ference follow:  the Con WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSl  NESS-JANUARY 13-17, 1980 DELEGATE REC  OMMENDATIONS  <Listed in order of priority set by delegates>  1. Replace the present corporate and indt  vidual income tax schedules with more grad1949  uated rate scales, specifying the graduated  corporate tax scale up to $500,000.  2. Adopt a simplified accelerated capital  cost recovery system to replace the present  complex Asset Depreciation Range <ADR>  regulations, with provisionS such as <A> im mediately expensing capital costS' less than  a specified amount, <B> immediately expens-  ing government mandated capital costs, and  <C> the creation of a maximum annual bene  fit that may be derived from the system.  3. Balance the Federal Budget by statute  in Fjscal Year 1981 by limiting total Federal  spending to a percentage of the GNP, com mencing with 20 percent and declining to 15  percent.  4. Revise estate tax laws to ease the tax  burden on family-owned. businesses and en courage the continuity of family ownership.  5. Congress shall exercise  its oversight  function with the assistance of the General  Accounting Office,  instituting  sunset  re views of all laws, regulations, and agencies,  to ensure that none exceeds original con gressional intent. Sunset reviews, in an ap.  propriate time frame <not less than every  five years> should include economic impact  analysis and proposed agency budget reduc  tions, leading to re-enactment of each agen  cys enabling legislation to permit its contin ued existence, or to reduce its size and cost.  <A> Establish a Regulatory Review Board  COIJlposed of representatives from the Ex ecutive Branch, Congress and small business  owners, with responsibility for impact state ments and cost controls.    <B> Congress shall exercise line-item veto  over  regulations within a  specified  time  through  congressional  oversight  commit tees, with one-house floor vote.  8. SUpport and urge passage of S. 1.860,  the Small Business Innovation Act of 1979,  and companion bill H.R. 5607, as presently  drafted with  flexibility  for minor  future  amendments, covering:  small business  re search . and development set-asides;  small  business innovation and research programs  <as already encompassed by H.R. 5126 and  S. 1074>: patents retention; amendments to  the Internal Revenue Code; and regulatory  flexibility.  7. Provide. for a tax credit . for initial in vestment in a small business, and permit de  ferral of taxes for roll-overs of investments  affecting small businesses.  8. Reform the Social Security System by  including, where constitutionally possible,  all public and private sector employees as  contributors and more closely tie benefits to  contributions to move the system toward ac tuarial  soundness. Limit benefits  to  the  original  old-age  and  survivors  benefits.  Freeze the tax base and tax rate at the Jan uary 1980 level. Eliminate double dipping.  9. Provide tax incentives in the form of a  new security called a Small Business Partici pating . Debenture <SBPD>  to  provide  a  source of capital for small busines...c:;es.  10. The Office of Advocacy must be main tained. reinforced and expanded .. so that ac  tivity be not less than 5 percent of the SBA  salary and expense budget. The legislative  mission of Advocacy must be considered the  number onepriority of SBA and the.Office  of Advocacy. The independence of  that  function of the Office of Advocacy must be  protected so that it may continue to have  the confidence o.f the small business com munity. SBA's Advocacy. budget should be  devoted to economic research and analysis,  as well as small business advocacy. Small  business advocates, under the direct ~upervi  sion of the SBA Office of Advocacy. shall be  assigned to OMB ... Federal Re~erve Board.  Treasury, International Trade Policy Com mittee and other regulatory agencies.  11.

68,Senate,96,0.084,625,2,Mr. CHAFEE.,"  very much.  Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 414,  the University and Small Business Pat ent Procedures Act, I rise in strong sup port of the measure.  This  legislation would: First, estab lish a uniform Federal patent procedure;  and second, create a consistent policy  and procedure concerning  the patent ability of inventions made with Federal  assistance. It will, in my judgment, vig orously encourage the development and  utilization of  inventions arising  from  Government  supported university and  small business research.  The problems addressed by S. 414 are  clear and disturbing. The Federal Gov ernment, which cosponsors research that  leads to hundreds of valuable technolog ical discoveries in such fields as medicine  and energy,  lacks the resources to de velop and market a product. Yet,  the  Government, in most cases, retains pat ent rights to those discoveries and is un willing to relinquish them. This situation  discourages private  industry from  vesting the money necessary for product  development.  As many of my colleagues are aware,  the Office of Patents and Trademarks is  encountering  severe  difficulties.  The  case-by-case review of each patent ap plication has resulted in lengthy delays.  These delays have caused the United  States to fall behind in its  traditional  role of international leadership in tech nological  innovation. The numbe1 of  patents  issued each year has der.lined  since 1973, while the number granted to  foreign concerns has increased to 35 per cent of all patents filed in this country.  Mr. President, we now have a situation  where less than 4 percent of 30,000 pat ents held by the Government have been  successfully  licensed.  These  circum stances act as a significant deterrent to  the participation of many of our coun try's leading scientists in high-technol ogy industries.  More importantly, the absence of any  incentive  for commercial development  in these areas costs the United States an  in ",1980

70,Senate,96,-0.379,677,2,Mr. MUSKIE.," Mr.  President,  the  amendment offered  today by  the dis tinguished Senator  from New Mexico  raises an issue of increasing concern to  the Congress-that is how can we per form our constitutional responsib1lities  in a manner which assures that the laws  of this country are carried out in an  effective and efficient manner and in a  way which is consistent with the intent  of the Congress.  I  am, however,  deeply  troubled by  the solution which the Senator proposes,  for I firmly believe that a general leg islative veto, which would permit either  congress may,  in a  statute subject  to  Presidential approval or disapproval, estab lish a ""sunset"" period !or rules or regulations  which provides for the lapsing of such rules  or regulations after a given period of time.

78,House,96,-0.023,755,2,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, as the cold  north winds descend upon the American  public, the issue of energy assistance to  the beleaguered consumer, who has been  wracked by-14 percent inflation, must be  raised. Reports have indicated that 6 to 8  percent of that 14 percent figure can be  attributed directly to rising energy costs.  Energy  is not a  luxury item that our  citizens can forgo, but rather a neces sity.  Last May, I had the fores1ght to spon sor a measure designed to alleviate the  overwhelming burden placed upon  the  220 million citizens of this country by the  OPEC oil ministers. I, along with anum ber of my colleagues, recognized the need  to offer some energy assistance in the  form of tax credits to that sector of so ciety which has paid consistently for the  hundreds of assistance programs created  by the Federal Government-the middle  income wage earner. It has been the mid dle  income earner who has supported  these large, high cost transfer programs  since the passage of the 16th amendment  in 1913,  the year that the income tax  amendment was adopted.  Mr.  Speaker,  this Government has  taken and  taken and  taken  from  the  pockets  of  the middle  income wage  earner. It  is high  time  to give  them  something in return for a change. Each  and every Member of  this body must  make his feelings known to the conferees  on the windfall profit tax bill now. If  this middle income tax credit provision  for energy is not included in the final  package,  I  daresay  that  the Henry  Thoreaus of  this Nation are going  to  stand up and be counted.

79,House,96,0.49,755,2,Mr. DORNAN.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday  I was very proud to be a Member of this  distinguished body because of the unan imous 402-to-0 vote on House Concurrent  Resolution 272 which directs that said  resolution be taken to the Soviet Ambas sador to the United States and through  him be delivered to the Chairman of the  Presidium of the Supreme Soviet asking  that they release from ""internal exile""  Dr. Andrei Sakharov. It is a  rare day,  indeed, when this great body, of such di verse opinion and the daily scene of such  vigorous and spirited debate, joins unan imously to do anything. There is always  at least 1 ""present"" vote recorded be cause of a conflict of interest, or at least  3  or more Members  swimming  up stream against 400 and sometimes right fully  so. But not yesterday. It was a  beautiful 402 to 0.  think that  the symbolism of  this  unanimous  resolution  from  the House  for just one man-although in our state ment we also mention the other human  rights heroes in the Soviet Union such as  Shcharansky, Orlov, Rudenko, Tykhy,  and  Petkus-is  powerful  symbolism.  Sadly some Americans in both great par ties, some conservatives and some lib erals, including a Presidential candidate  from  the other body,  find  symbolism  meaningless  if not  counterproductive.  Some have not stopped attacking  the  President over the Olympic boycott and  the wheat  boycott. There  are many  journalists already criticizing our unani mous vote yesterday.  Well,  I  suggest these people  history.  All one has to do is read Lenin to re alize how  important  symbolism  is  to  Communists and communism.

84,House,96,-0.373,781,2,Mr. NOLAN.," Mr. Chairman,  in  the  last 10 years we have poured concrete  over 30 million acres of farmland. That  is more cropland than presently exists  in  the State of  Iowa: Land  that can  never again grow food for our hungry  world.  In the next 20 years, world population  is expected to  increase by 50 percent,  while we lose another 60 million acres  of farmland.  American agriculture has made tre mendous strides in improving food pro duction yields over the last 20 years, but  not without cost. Farmers used an aver age of 21  pounds of petroleum based  fertilizer in 1950. By 1970, fertilizer use  increased to 143 pounds-a 570-percent  increase. Machinery use increased by 68  percent. From 1910 until the present, the  fossil fuel energy needed to produce food  has risen from nearly zero to a ratio of  9 energy units to 1 food energy unit.  Today's energy crisis will likely diminish  rather than increase use of  these im provements, meaning  that more  land  will be needed to meet food production  needs.  The immediate problem is the direct  displacement of 3 million acres per year  of productive agricultural land by hous ing, office buildings, factories, commer cial development and public works proj ects. In addition to these direct losses  there are often spillover effects for near by farms, and agricuiltural support serv ices, as well as social, economic, and life style changes for nearby rural commu nities.  Most States have recognized the value  of retaining agricultural land but have  been unable to effectively deal with the  problem. For example, 42 States have  preferential tax assessment statutes in tended  to keep farmland  in farm use.  However, preferential  tax assessment,  although helping farmers, has not been  effective in protecting farmland. A re cently completed report to Congress by  the General Accounting Office entitled  ""Preserving  America's  Farmland--A  Goal  the Federal Government Should  Support"" concludes that existing State  and local protection techniques have had  limited impact on the loss of farmlands.  Even with the attention of the State  and local level to agricultural land pro tection, America is still a long way from  solving  the problem. Of  the 15 States  producing 86 percent of our wheat, only  1, California,  has  a  State  farmland  protection program. Of  the 15 States  that produce 91 percent of our corn, only  1, Wisconsin,  has  a  State  farmland  protection program. There is a need for  more of these programs to insure future  maintenance and productivity of our  agricultural lands.  H.R. 2551 vests  the Federal Govern ment with a strong supporting role in as sisting States' and local units of govern ment to deal with the problems of con version of agricultural land to nonagri cultural uses. The Federal Government  has an obligation to provide such support  to States and local units of government if  the loss of our Nation's farmland is to be  effectively and appropriately addressed.  At the same time, H.R. 2551 vigorously  supports  the  traditional  authority of  State and local governments in making  public interest decisions concerning the  use and disposition of agricultural land.  H.R. 2551 will provide State and local  governments with comprehensive, cur rent, and reliable information on all is sues affecting cropland conversion and  various methods of retaining this land  in agricultural use. In addition the bill  is designed to stimulate new and inno vative farmland preservation techniques  at the State and local level, and to en courage Federal agencies  to be more  sensitive to this problem and more sensi tive to State and local efforts to preserve  farmland.  As chairman of the subcommittee re sponsible for this legislation, I want to  assure you this matter has received very  thorough consideration.  Subcommittee hearings were first held  in June 1977 on the subject of the loss of  agricultural land. Since that date, over  200 witnesses have testified in subsequent  hearings on the need to protect farmland  from conversion. Over 300 of the Nation's  newspapers have recently carried stories  on  the problems of agricultural  land  loss, many with editorials calling for leg islation. In a  recent Louis Harris poll  commissioned by the USDA, 53 percent  of the national sample said they consid ered the loss of good farmland to be a  ""serious"" issue.  By enactment of H.R. 2551, we can be gin to stimulate the voluntary efforts of  State and  local governments  to bring  this problem under control before we  face a national emergency. I urge your  prompt support. Thank you.  AGRICULTURAL  LAND  PROTECTION  ACT, H.R.  2551  the Congress enact H.R.  local  1. Why should  2551?  The U.S.  loses over 3 mlllion  acres of  agricultural land each year and this loss has  been accelerating  since 1942  according  to  USDA. Agricultural production peaked  in  1972. Our  abi11ty  to  increase  production  through additional technology appears to be  leveling off and is threatened by scarce and  expensive  energy  and water,  and  higher  transportation costs.  Much of  the agricultural  land ""reserve""  of approximately 100 million acres is forest land or pasture,  is in need of irrigation or  expensive  treatment, or presently not suit able for farming, according to the General  Accounting Office.  Continued farmland loss has serious im plications  for our ability  to produce  food  at reasonable cost for both the export mar ket and domestic consumption. Agriculture  as an economic enterprise is threatened in  many areas. The family farm  is often the  first to feel the pressure for agricultural land  conversion.  The U.S. will need additional productive  capacity  and  land  for  alcohol  fuels  and  gasohol production  to enhance our energy  independence and national security.  A recent Lou Harris public opinion poll  showed that 53 percent of the nation's popu lation consider the loss of good farmland to  be a serious problem.  2. What  is  the  role of State and  governments under H.R. 2551?  State and  local governments alone have  responsibility  for developing and carrying  out agricultural  land protection programs  in cooperation with land owners. The pro grams they adopt under H.R. 2551 would be  of their own choosing. They would be sup ported by matching, demonstration grants  authorized at $60 million over a  three-year  period. Demonstration projects are complete ly voluntary and would result in testing new  approaches or improving current ones. State  and  local officials would decide and might  use  improved  tax  incentives,  agricultural  districts, development rights transfer or pur chase, new approaches to easements or other  approaches. Most importantly combinations  of  improved or new approaches could be  tested for the first time. No more than two  projects using  the same method could be  funded, so as to encourage the development  of a variety of approaches.  3. Will H.R. 2551 result in Federal control?  No. To  the contrary,  the bill places all  responsib111ty at  the state and  local  level.  It would strengthen state and local efforts  by improving current methods or developing  new  ones. An amendment  offered during  floor debate, would require federal actions to  be consistent with state and local farmland  programs,  adopted and approved by state  and local elected officials.  Section 302 would expressly prohibit the  federal government  (on  its own behalf or  through requirements imposed on state and  local governments)  from  regulating or re stricting private property rights, or infringe,  diminish or increase state and local govern ment authority.  4. What role will farmers play under H.R.  2551?  Experience has  shown  that no county,  local or state agricultural  land protection  program can be effective without the strong  support  of  the  agricultural  community.  Those  states and  local governments  that  have taken action to protect farmland have  done so with the approval and involvement  of farmers, both in the development and im plementation of their programs.  5.

85,House,96,0.863,794,2,Mr. PAUL.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to thank the gentleman from Colorado  for bringing this very important subject  to our attention. I  think the real issue  here is whether or not we should recon sider an  interventionist foreign policy  which we have followed now for quite a  few decades, unfortunately, and, ill-ad visedly,  I  think  the  last several skirmishes we have had-some call  them  wars; yet they have never. been declared  wars-have led only to disaster for us,  especially the Korean episode as well as  the Vietnam episode.  Here we  are stirring again, getting  prepared, talking about a draft, and get ting the young people lined up. They are  so blatant about it. Sadat said it very  plainly:  This is the beginning of the war for the  oil wells.  I think this is rather tragic. It is tragic  because it is not necessary. Tragic be cause it is the policies of this Congress  here that have driven us  into this de pendency on foreign oil. And yet it is  only the policies of the free market, that  if we would only follow then we could be  totally dependent on ourselves and inde pendent of  other nations  for  energy  sources.  Sometimes we  hear  figures  thrown  about that we are in tremendous need  of the foreign oil coming from the Per sian Gulf.  I would  like  to point out  something that might make us recon sider: In spite of the fact that we ob struct so much in this country the pro duction of energy,  in comparison  the  amount of energy we get through the  Strait of Hormuz is only 6.8 percent of  all our energy. That is all  that came  through the strait in 1978. So it is a small  amount. We certainly could adjust, ad just either with increased production or  decreased consumption.  In 1979 approximately 5 percent of  our energy came through the strait. Yet  we have four new nuclear powerplants  standing idle today, ready to be opened  but obstructed by excessive regulation.  Enough energy could be produced  in  these  four nuclear powerplants  to be  equivalent to all the oil we have been  getting from Iran. Yet we foolishly con tinue to plan for war and intervention  in this area.  We must really think seriously about  this. When we talk about going over to  defend Pakistan. It was only a few weeks  ago that we offered  them $400 million  in foreign aid and they said that was  just ""peanuts.""  Last March  the President  requested  and got $400 million in emergency mili tary aid for Yemen so it could protect  itself from communism. Now Yemen has  become pro-Soviet and is talking about  reunifying with the Communist neigh bor South Yemen. So we have just poured  more dollars over there for the use of  the Communists.  What happened to the support we gave  Iran? It is being held now by the leaders  of Iran who hold our people hostage. It  makes no sense at all for us to go in and  plan for and have military intervention  under these conditions.  We are a  lot less dependent on this  area of the world than they would lead  us to believe.  Consider West Europe, consider Japan  -who import 100 percent of their energy  needs, of  their oil. Why are  they ~ot  stirring? Why  are  they not  rushmg  troops over  there? Why are  they not  concerned? How much are they spending  on their national defense?  ",1980

106,,96,-0.451,833,2,Mr. FARY.," Mr.  Speaker,  distin guished colleagues,  I am greatly dis turbed by  the  fact  that NBC has  chosen to air a movie, ""The Epd,"" on  'February 12. I have long supported a  campaign opposing the obscene deni gration of Polish Americans that takes  place in this film. I first brought this  filtn to the attention of my colleagues  in -a statement on the House floor on  August 1,. 1978, when I  first became  aware of 'its existence. In that state ment, I explained why the film is of fensive . not only to Polish Aniericans  but to all civilized people because it  denigrates the Polish national anthem  in such a crude manner that it is indi rectly an insult to all peoples whose  anthem  is  an  expression  of  their  unique heritage.  Mr. Speaker,  I  still feel  the same  way I did back in 1978 when I said  thatThe questionable propriety displayed by  the motion picture industry in presen~ing  this  obscene  production  for  ""entertain ment'' is against the custo~ and manners  of polite society, and such films should be  censored by the motion picture industry.  Thinking back on the early days of Amer ica,  I  recall the history of hardships and  struggles our forefathers endured fighting  for America's freedom.  I  remember with  pride the contributions made by tJ:le Polish  patriot Thaddeus Kosciuszko, the brilliant  military engineer who laid out the fortifica tion at West Point, and his defense strategy  of amphibious maneuvers at the Battle of  Saratoga expediting  the final defeat and  surrender of the British at Yorktown.  Here again r recall from history another  Polish-hero of  the American Revolution,  Gen. Kazimierz Pulaski, who  fought gal lantly in-the Battle of Savannah, Ga., where  his body rests  in sacred grounds. On his  monument are the words: ""Perhaps a braver  tpan than Pulaski never drew a sword.""  Mr. Speaker, it grieves me to think of the  stigma of disrepute  labeled  against  the  Polish peoples as a result of the film ""The  End."" The innuendoes -as presented stain  the memories of those great Polish patriots  and thousands of other Polish Americans  who not only fought for and-help build, but  contributed greatly to the . arts and science  oi our ~reat country.  If thiS. fype of filin is permitted to be displayed, we have reached a .low ebb in Ameri can behavior, as this ethnic slur is unpar donable and unforgivable.  Mr. Speaker, now that this film is to  be shown again,  I have heard from  various Polish-American groups and  organizations protesting .its  insuiting  and obscene presentation of people  who are  just as American as Burt  Reynolds,  . coproducer,  director,  and  stat of  ""The End.""

The  ordered  reported  legislation  imple menting U.S. obligations under the In ternational Cpffee  report itself has not been filed yet,  and no further action has been taken  on that legislation.  Following Is an excellent speech by  the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  State for International Resources and  Food Policy, describing  the current  status of coffee  trade and problems  which have arisen within the Interna tional Coffee Agreement.  I doubt that any action will occur on  coffee legislation until. the problems  described in this speech are addressed,  either  unilaterally  by  the Bogota  group or multilaterally  through the  I CA.  The speech follows:  STATDUN'l' BY MICHAEL CALINGAEPT  I am delighted to have this opPQrtunity to  participate in the NCA's 69th Annual Con vention. Since assuming my duties a year  ago in the Department of State, I have been  pleased to continue the close working rela tionship we . have, had with many of the  leaders of your Industry. we value highly  the  soundness of  their  advice  and  the  eandor with which.they offer it.  Your convention  theme, ""Coffee Takes  Stock. Now the 80s"", Ia most appropriate. As  we begin a new decade, it Ia natural to re fiect on what has aone before and on what  the future may hold. Today I would like to  share with you our perceptions of recent  events  and  trends  in  the  international  coffee economy and also to discuss possible  future directions.  THE IIARKE'l' OUTLOOK  For the coffee Industry the latter half of  the 1970's was a tumultuous period. There  were wide fiuctuations in production. stocks,  prices, and consumption. The central event,  of course, was the Brazilian frost of 1975. At  one stroke, this catastrophe transformed a  comfortable supply-demand situation Into a  tight balance. Even now, almost five years  after  the frost, Brazilian production and  world stocks have not yet returned to their  pre-frost levels. As a result of the frost and  other subsequent supply disruptions, coffee  prices during the last four years have been  volatile and. on average, high.  We can l>e hopeful now, however, that we  are entering a period of. greater stabillty.  The consensus Ia that Brazil Is one frost free winter away from producing 25-30 mil lion bags. Overall world production has  been climbing steadily  for  the past four  years. USDA's most  recent estimate  for  1979-80 production Is 81.8 million bags-the  third highest total ever.  Global cons-umption  trends are also en  couraging,  International Coffee Organiza tion statistics indicate that consumption. in  member countries has now. recovered to the  pre-frost level. As you know, the figures for  the United States are not as reassuring, but  even here coffee consumption has rebound ed strongly from the low point reached in  1977. On balance I think it is fair to say that  the fundamental supply-demand outlook for  the world coffee economy is favorable.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ICO  IN THE HOUSE 01' REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 6, 1980'  e Mr. V ANIK. Mr. Speaker, late last  year, the Ways and Means Committee  Turning  to  the  International  Coffee  Agreement, the situation Is less encourag ing. We have now passed the baH-way point  of the present Agreement-yet Important  Issues relating to the ICA's economic provi  sions rema.ID unresolved. More stgnfricantly~  <with.the operation, or, as they see it. the  several  producing  countries,  dissatisfied  non-operation  of  the Agreement,  have  Joined  together and Intervened  In world  coffee markets to achieve their own unilat eral  price  objectives~ Consequently U.S.  Congressional approval of ICA implement  ing legislation Is in doubt. Within the execu tive branch, we are reviewing our coffee  policy and the U.S. role in the ICO.  Thus, while the outlook for  the coffee  economy Is promising, prospects for multi  lateral producer-consumer cooperation are  not good. To understand how we have  reached  this current  impasse,  I  think  it  would be useful to review what has occurre<t  In the ICO in recent years.  The most convenient starting point is July  1978. That month  green  coffee  prices  reached the bottom of their long decline  from  the record highs reached the . year  before. In 1977, coffee prices hit $3.27 /lb. In  July 1978 they fell below $1.20/lb.  ~oducers reacted by proposing that ICA  export quotas be imposed on the market im mediately. The position of the U.S., and the  other consuming countries, was that such  action would be premature-it would be  more prudent to wait until the September  1978 Coffee Council meeting, when the Bra  ~ frost  season was  over,  to decide  whether to Impose quotas. ThJs seemed to  us to be an appropriate response since, even  at $1.20/lb., coffee prices were well above  historical averages, both in nominal imd in  constant terms.  A frost did occur in August and by the  time of the Council meeting prices had risen  above $1.50/lb. At the Council the unani~  mous consumer position was that immediate  quota imposition was out of the question.  The Council session instead focused on re-  vising the price  levels that automatically  trigger imposition of export quotas.  The main concern for the U.S. was that  any council decision should be consistent  with the need to facilltate a resumption In  coff,ee consumption-which was then only  begi.n:n:lng  to recover from:  the disastrous  lows reached In 1977 and early 1978. Never  theless, the U.S. was prepared to support a  revision in the trigger prtces that more than  compensated'tOI"" Increases in coffee produc  tion costs and general inflation that had oc the Agreement entered  into  effect in 1976.  Unfortunately, the 1978 Coffee Council  ended its deliberations without agreement.  Although there was a consensUs that the  trigger prices should be increased, Council  members were unable to agree on a specific  level. In effect, the producers preferred no  revision In the trigger prices to acceptance  of an increase they deemed insufficient.  In many respects last September's Coffee  Council was similar to the 1978 Council: a  Brazilian frost had boosted prices; consum ers agreed that immediate quota imposition  was unwarranted;  the principal Issue was  the price level at which quotas would auto matically be imposed; and again the Council  was unable to reach agreement. There was,  however, an important new factor that in  nuenced the 1979 coffee council delibera tions: The Bogota Group.  eurred since  Tim BOGOTA GROUP  I have reviewed in some detail the market  events of July-September 1978. This is an  important period because at the same time  they were negotiating within the ICO, pro ducers were taking steps on their own out  side the ICO.  ",1980
109,,96,0.49,872,2,Mr. DORNAN.," Mr. Speaker, on Jan uary 27, the CBS news program, ""60  Minutes,"" carried an  ihterview with  the  Soviet  defector Arkady  Shev chenko, the former Undersecretary for  Political Affairs at the United Nations  Secretariat. Shevchenko revealed the  extent of Soviet espionage operations  based at the U.N. headquarters in New  York City. Ori January 28, I  told the  Member.s of this House that I would  Insert the transcript of the CBS report  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  February 6, 1980  in  as .quickly as the CBS New York of fices could get it down to me. The con should serve as a sharp reminder to  tents of the report are shocking and  the Members of this House of the im mediate need to rebuild our defeated,  decimated,  and  demoralized  intelli gEmce agencies. They are integral . to  our national defense. The non-Com munist world looks to us for  intelli gence leadership, not to some James  Bond fantasy.  It is my privilege to submit the tran script for the benefit of my colleagues  of  this  outstanding Mike Wallace  effort at truth seeking and waking up  ""America, the 'Sleeping Giant'~:  RUSSIAN SPIES IN THE U.S.A.  <Produced by Gail Eisen>  MIKE wALLACE. Detente is dead The cold  war is back on again. And nonetheless, ac cording to a man who should know, a small  army of Russian spies continues to operate  with  remarkable  freedom  in  the United  States. The man who says that is Arkady  Shevchenko, who, until his dramatic defec tion  to  the United States  in 1978, was  thought to be a SO'Viet hardliner, close to  Brezhnev and Gromyko. It turned out he  was_something different.  This man who talked to us about Russian  spies in the U~S. told the House Select Com mittee on  Intelligence  two  days  ago  Washington that he had defected because  ""democracy in the Soviet Union is a mock ery,"" and that ""elementary human rights do  not exist"" .there. For five years before his  defection, Shevchenko served as undersecre tary for political affairs in the United Na tions Secretariat. In that post, he was in a  position to know what went on in Moscow,  at the Russian UN Mission in New York,  and in the UN Secretariat itself.  I asked Shevchenko how many spies the  Russians have now working under cover of  UN headquarters in New York.  ARKADY SHEVCHENKO. Half of the Soviet  diplomatic staff would be either KGB offi  cers or the GRU officers.  WALLACE. That means that in the United  Nations bufiding on New York's East River,  among  the clerks and Am~assadors, the  functionaries and reporters who roam these  corridors,  the Soviets have succeeded  in  planting literally hundreds of their spies.  SHEVCHENKO. The professional KGB and  the GRU, at least 300 it would be.  WALLACE. We wondered whether Sliev chenko's figures, his estimates as  to  the  number of KGB and GRU officers-GRU is  Soviet Military Intelligence, working under  cover of the UN, we wondered if those fig ures were accurate. For 12 years, FBI officer  Larry McWilliaxns, now retired, worked in  counter intelligence against the Soviets in  the city of New York.  You would say then 350 would be in espionage?  LARRY McWILLIAMS. Yes.  WALLACE. That's a lot.  McWILLIAMS. That's an awful lot. It's a  horrendous task to try and counter.  SHEVCHENKO. The more personnel  they  have, the more difficult FBI task to follow  them, if you have hundreds of these people  wandering around in this country. That's  why the -UN Secretariat is so important for  them, because there they can have such a  huge. army of the KGB professionals or  GRU professionals, that gives them advan advantages. They dont.:...  they don't care  aboot how much personnel. Theythey  couldif they would be  allowed,  they  would send thousands here. The UN staff  member, they-unlike the Soviet diplomats,  they could travel without prior identifica tion in this country.  WALLACE.  In  other words,  you,  as  a  member of the UN Secretariat, can travel  any place?  SHEVCHENKO. Yes, any place, except the  military bases or restricted area, where ~ven  American are not allowed to-to come.  WALLACE. The Uniteli Nations  then, Mr.  McW1lliaxns,  is  the single most important  spy nest, if you want to call it that, in the  world today.  McWILLIAMS. Hm-mmm. My view, defi nitely. No doubt about it, because of their  basic freedom of travel. But beyond that,  they're in a marvelous position in this ~ity  that contains everything. It contains  the  head corporations of industry. I~ contains fi nance. They're interested in economics. My  gosh, there's no better place on earth to be.  You see, it's gotthere's so many of the  headquarters of industrial empires that deal  with  sophisticated weapons,  communica tions; all sorts. It's a marvelous place for a  spy to be.  WALLACE.  A marvelous' place, partly be cause of the opportunities there are here in  New York for electronic eavesdropping. For  example, at the Russian UN Mission on the  East Side of Manhattan, or at their apart ment complex in the suburb of Riverdale, at  their estate in Oyster Bay, Long Island, and  especially at  their retreat  in Glen Cove,  Long Island. The Soviets have the most so phisticated equipment for listening, for elec tronic surveillance.  SHEVCHENKO.  They have the highly SO  phisticated electronic equipment for-as in terception of the telecommunications,  the  radio communications ill this country, eye dropping and all the thing. So thatWALLACE. Eavesdropping.  SHEVCHENKO. Yes. <laughs> Not eyedrop ping. It's eavesdropping. Yes.  WALLACE. You mean that theythey do  eavesdrop  anq  intercept  telecommunica tions, telephone calls, cables?.  SHEVCHENKO. Yes, that's correct. That is that is exactly so.  McWILLIAMS.  Soviet military attache's  office in Washington, the Soviet Embassy,  just go past them, and you  look up and  you'll see nothing but a massive amount of  sophisticated antenna. And that's used for  monitoring of all types of communications satellites, telephones, radio. Now, if you get  into  the scientific field and start talking  about computerization, <there> are multiple  listening devices. My God, they can sit up  -there with one. of those antenna and just  listen to thousands upon thousands of tele  phone conversations wandering around this  area.  WALLACE.  Of course the FBI can listen  too, as they did during an operation against  the Soviets in April of 1977. They chose U.S.  Navy Commander Arthur Lindberg to flush  out some Russian U~ spies. Posing as a  tourist, he boarded a Russian cruise ship,  and on leaving the vessel, he hande~ over a  note addressed simply: ""To the Russian Am bassador.""  Commander ARTHUR LINDBERG. The note  said, ""I am a career American Naval officer  stationed in the New York City area, and  will  retire in six years.  I'm interested  in  making additional money prior to UtY retire ment and can provide you with information  which may be of inte.rest to you.

Mr. Chairman, I want to associate my self with the remarks made by the gen tleman from New Mexico <Mr. LUJAN)  and just add that the experts who ap peared before our committee all agreed  that a  complete buy-out of Wellton Mohawk would not solve the problem. As  the gentleman  from New MeXico has  said,  there are many other sources of  salinity along the river in addition  to  the Wellton-Mohawk.  Mr. Chairman, I would point out that  if this were done, it would cost over $530  million and still not solve the problem,  which is the salinity of the water as it  goes into Mexico.  T~;terefore,  For those reasons, I oppose the amend ment.  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment offered by the gentle man from California <Mr. BaowN) .  The amendment was rejected.  AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. BROWN OF  CALIFORNIA  ",1980
112,,96,0.265,924,2,Mr. SATTERFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, re cently,  I have detected an  increasing  awareness around the country that in  our pursuit of the highly desirable goal  of a cleaner environment, we may have  committed ourselves  to  some pollcies  which are both unnecessary and unwise.  In particular, my own State of Vir ginia, along with 28 other States, is now  faced with an ultimatum from the En vironmental Protection Agency. It must  establish a program, satisfactory to the  EPA, for the compulsory inspection and  testing of motor vehicles for compliance  with auto emissions standards. Failure  to do so will result in a cutoff of Federal  funds  and  the  even more draconian  sanction of a freeze on all new industrial  construction in the offending State.  I  strongly  believe  that air quality  standa.rds sufficient to protect the pub lic health should be achieved within a  reasonable period of time. However, I be lieve equally strongly  that each State  should be free to choose how to achieve  those standards. For this reason, I have  today  introduced a bill  to amend  the  Clean Air Act to allow each State to de termine whether or not a mandatory in spection and maintenance program for  motor vehicles is necessary and practi cable. Enactment of this bill would not  relieve the States of their responsibility  to achieve compliance with the national  be  air quality standards. It would simply al low each State to choose the best way to  achieve those standards.  The need for  this legislation is par ticularly urgent in  light of  increasing  doubt about the effectiveness of such in spection and maintenance requirements  as a pollution control technique. A per suasive case has not been made for the  reliability of the inspection and main tenance methods  presently  available.  Evidence of the ultimate effect of inspec tion and maintenance upon ozone levels  is conspicuously lacking. on the other  hand, the theoretical benefits of insp~­ tion and maintenance programs requ1re  the imposition of quite substantial costs  upon the motoring public. Estimates vary  widely, but the best figures I have been  able to obtain indicate that, in my State,  an inspection and maintenance program  applying only to northern Virginia and  the Richmond area would cost motorists  somewhere between $8 and $23 million  every year, not including the hundreds of  thousands  of wasted man-hours  in volved, or the administrative costs to the  State. The total cost to all of the States  subject  to  the  inspection and mainte nance  requirements would  in  the  range of $300 to $800 million a year.  Assuming that the benefits of inspec tion and maintenance programs are more  than theoretical, how do they compare  with these burdensome costs? What ex actly would we be getting?  In the overwhelming majority of the  areas which a.re subject to this require ment, the 1987 deadline for attainment  of the ozone standard will be achieved  regardless of whether an inspection and  maintenance program is  imposed. The  dominant influence upon total automo tive emissions will be changing :fleet com position. As newer, low-emission auto mobiles replace older, dirtier cars, total  emissions will fall, regardless of whether  inspection and maintenance is required.  More reliable emissions control technol ogy and a  reduction  in total mileage  driven as a result of high gasoline prices  can also be expected to have a significant  impact. At best, inspection and mainte nance programs will have only a rela tively small impact. Does attainment of  the ozone standard 6 months or a year  earlier than would otherwise be the case  justify the costs of such programs? I sug gest that this kind of decision  is best  left to the States.  Nearly 4 years ago I wrote the follow ing words in the committee report whieh  accompanied proposed amendments  to  the Clean Air Act, including a provision  to require an automotive inspection and  maintenance program:  A State is not prohibited by the present  Olean Air Act, and it should not be, from  imposing motor vehicle registration and test ing should it decide to do so. Some States  have elected  to  inaugurate such  systems.  There is a distlnot difference, however, be tween a State system adopted by its legisla tive body and a system imposed upon a State,  wanted or not, by the Federal legislature.  This effort to insinuate the Federal Gov ernment into the exclusive jurisdiction of a  State to regulate the registration of a vehicle  and license its operation on the public streets  and roadways in that State would raise a  serious constitutional question. Under  the  expressed terms of the proposed section, the  prohibitions dealing with  registration and  operation of vehiCles would be achieved by a  revised implementation plan subject only to  approval of the administrator. The essential  connection between provisions of that plan  Sind State legislative action whioh would be  required to implement it is obviously absent.  Considering  the doctrine of separation of  Federal and State governments inherent in  our pollticaJ system, the inviolate exclusive  jurisdiction of the State, and the contsitu tional hiatus this provision could produce  should the legislature of a.n affected State  refuse to enact the required legislation, the  problems of this provLsd.on are obvious and  offensive  to our Federal system of govern ment. Congress should not precipitate this  confrontatiOIIl by enactment of this provision.  The bill to which tlwse views were ap pended was not enacted that year, but in  legislation enacted by the 95th Congress  its provisions served as a basis for the  requirements which are now in effect.  I believe events have fully justified the  concerns which I expressed in 1976, and  that the  time has come  to allow  the  States to pursue the goal of a cleaner ajr  in a more :flexible and rational manner.

119,Senate,96,-0.598,989,2,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, I ap plaud my colleagues from Washington  and Oregon for offering the Magnuson Packwood amendment.  While there is much in S. 1991 that is  laudable, I share the concern of my col leagues that this bill sets an unfortunate  precedent by ending two pending rule makings: Children's advertising and vol untary  standards  and  certification  development.  While I take no position on the merits  of either of these rulemakings, I agree  that it makes no sense to end them in  midstream, thus denying the public the  opportunity to make its views known on  the issues.  Last night by a decisive vote the Sen ate adopted the Levin-Boren amendment  to provide for review of FTC rules after  they are finished. Given that we have  this mechanism in place, why do we need  to set an unfortunate precedent for the  administrative process  (for this agency  and others) by rushing in and cutting  off what  is admittedly a vigorous and  healthy debate? It just makes no sense.  Substantial sums of money have been  spent by the FTC and the public to gen erate detailed  factual  information on  these  two  issues. What could be more  wasteful than to terminate the proceed ings before the inquiries are complete?  Much has been said here and in the  editorial pages about the special-interest  odor this bill has taken on. We could take  a significant step toward clearing the air  by allowing these two rulemakings to be  completed.  Therefore I applaud the amendment  and I urge my colleagues to support it.   ",1980
120,Senate,96,0.072,989,2,Mr. WEICKER.," Mr. President, I am  pleased  to  join with my distinguished  colleagues from Washington, Mr. MAG NUSON, and from Oregon, Mr. PACKWOOD,  in cosponsoring this amendment to delete  sections 7 and 8 from S. 1991, the FTC  authorization bill. The purpose of this  amendment is to permit the completion  of two current FTC proceedings regard ing children's advertising and standards  and certification rulemakings.  At this point, Mr. President, I would  like to make perfectly clear that my posi tion on  this amendment  is not based  strictly on the merits of these two pro ceedings. Rather, my concern is that two  ongoing, quasi-judicial proceedings will  be terminated before a full record can be  compiled. I believe that this action sets a  dangerous precedent by allowing legis lative intervention in ongoing adminis trative proceedings.  The. FTC's authority to issue binding  regulations  is governed by the Federal  Trade Commission Improvement Act of  1975, more commonly known as the Mag nuson-Moss Act, the FTC's trade regula tions can be adopted only on the basis  of Commission proceedings which must  be virtually as formal and elaborate as  those required in a courtroom. Congress  has no more basis to interfere midstream  in an FTC proceeding than it does in the  midst of any judicial proceeding.  Mr. President, the Federal Trade Com mission was created by Congress as an  independent agency to protect against  unfair trade practices and promote com petition. Congressional  intent empha  ",1980

127,Senate,96,-0.301,1158,2,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, may  I compliment Senators HuDDLESTON and  MATHIAs on the great achievement which  this bill represents. They have devoted  immense amounts of time and effort to  the  task, and  the bill  is  testimony  to  their efforts.  Two weeks ago, six colleagues and I  joined together to introduce the Intel ligence Reform Act of 1980. As  I said  at that time:  OUr  blll  speaks  to  three  specific prob lems which have appeared in the operations  of our intelligence community. These are:  First, the process whereby Congress is kep.t  informed on the activities of the intell1gence  agencies; second, the requirement that our  intelligence  agencies  respond  to  requests  from  the general pubUc and make avail able  information  about  the  activities  of  those agencies; and third, the protection of  those individuals who undertake intelllgence  duties on our behalf.  At the same time, however,  thatI noted  What wm be discussed here today should  be seen as but the first blocks  in the re construction of our  intelligence commu nity, not the final edifice.  What I would  like to make clear at  this time is that the Intelligence Reform  Act of 1980 in no way contradicts or ob structs the bill which has just been intro duced. In fact, in most cases, the pro visions of  the Intelligence Reform Act  are the same as the corresponding pro visions in the charter, while in others,  the differences are easily reconsilable.  Section 2 of the Intelligence Reform  Act  repeals  the current Hughes-Ryan  amendment and replaces it with a re quirement that the President report all  special activities of the intelligence com munity  to the Intelligence Committees  of the House of Representatives and the  Senate. The same provision is contained  in the charter.  Section 3 partially exempts the CIA  from the operation of  the Freedom of  Information Act. The same exemption  is included in t'he charter.  Finally, section 4 provides for criminal  penalties for the disclosure of the identi ties of intelligence agents who are under  cover. While all are agreed on the neces sity of providing this protection for un dercover  intelligence  agents,  any at tempt  to write effective  legislation on  the subject poses first amendment diffl. culties. Consequently, it is not surprising  that the Intelligence Reform Act and the  charter have different language with re spect to this provision; indeed, the vari ous  executive  branch  agencies  have  taken opposing postions on this matter.  The Intelligence Reform Act provision is  taken  from  a  bill  introduced  in  the  House of Representatives  last October  by t'he entire membership of the House  Intelligence Committee. This committee  has just completed a set of hearings on  this question. The results of  their de liberations, ~long with the administra tion view on this matter, when a com mon administration position has been  achieved, will help guide us in reconcil ing the differences which currently exist  between the corresponding provisions of  the charter and t'he Intelligence Reform  Act.  Mr. President, may I make some addi tional observations about this subject.  One provision in our bill has given rise  to considerable misgiving, as I under stand, in the Department of Justice, and  that is the provision having to do with  the proposed penalties for the publica tion of the names of security agents with  the intent of harming our intelligence  capabilities-intent being absolutely the  clear prerequisite. Even so, it has been  suggested this might have a chilling ef fect upon the publication of information  that the journalists, publishers, and edi tors think important and there ought not  to be such an effect.  I have called upon the counsel of my  friend, Mr. Floyd Abrams, an attorney  of New York of the greatest experience  and reputation in these matters. I find  that he,  too,  is concerned; and he ex presses a concern perhaps greater than  some of the expressions of omcial con cern that appeared in the House of Rep resentatives hearings, where the House  select committee held hearings on this  matter not long ago.  Mr. Abrams has offered to provide me  his counsel in this matter. As an interim  statement I would like to record that it  is his judgment that the provisions in  the full charter are more to be desired,  and certainly less not to be desired, than  those in the Intelligence Reform Act, as  we  have  termed  our more  limited  measure.  I would like here to record that those  sensibilities ought to be ours in this mat ter, and I certainly want to be guided  by them. If in the end it does not prove  possible to obtain a full charter in this  Congress, and we move to a more limited  measure, such as the one that I and mY  colleagues have introduced, then I think  we will want to make some modifications  in this last and, in terms of the intelli gence community as a whole, least con sequential provision.  To a great many Americans, it is clear  that the need and propriety of a national  intelligence system is not self-evident. It  is not that many years since a Secretary  of State of the United States declined to  establish any cryptographic capability in  his department on grounds that gentle men do not read other gentlemen's mail.  There is a clear concern about the in fractions  associated with Government  activities that take place in secret. So the  need for this charter has arisen. I think  that if it is seen properly by the intelli gence community, it will be seen at least  as much a defense of their interests as  it is a control upon their activities. They  need to know what it is that is expected  of them, what they may do, and what  they may not do.  At the same time, I would hope all my  colleagues will recognize that it is pos sible to develop a charter of this kind  ostensibly for the purpose of establishing  the role of a government activity, but  with a hidden agenda of preventing it,  of obstructing it, of so inhibiting it as to,  in effect, abolish it.  It is a very fine line the committee has  tried to draw.  One would not be wrong, I  think, to  believe that the demand for this kind of  docwnent arose in an atmosphere where,  at least for some of those involved, the  political agenda was hostile to the execu tive and  to  its  foreign policies, and,  generally,  to  the notion of a United  States that was active and-! was go ing to say interventionist, but that would  have  the connotation of active  in the  minds of the persons whose viewpoint I  describe--fully engaged in international  affairs, that had not withdrawn its essen tial commitment to maintaining the free  nations in the face of the power of the  totalitarian ones. There is no question  that as part of the agenda of the initial  Senate inquiries there was the assump tion that if you could limit our capacities  to be an active agent in foreign affairs,  you would, to that degree, limit such ac tivity and achieve a clear political pur pose.  I would wish  to state that it is my  clearest understanding from 3 years on  the Intelligence Committee that this is  not the purpose of this charter at all,  although it may be its effect, and that  must be looked into.  Mr. President, you will find the char ter to be a mournful exercise in bureau cratic draftsmanship, page after page of  thou shalt nots-and the only positive  and repeated exhortation is  that thou  shall coordinate.  I would hope that in the end we will  have achieved something more precise,  less verbose, more compact. It is a dis couraging phenomenon, but the longer  this Republic  persists,  the  longer  its  pronouncements become, the more com plex its guidance becomes. If you con trast  the Constitution of  the United  States with the charter of the intelli gence agencies,  I  fear it does not re dound  to the advantage either of our  draftsmanship or our political science.  Even  so,  under  our  distinguished  chairman, we have produced a docu ment, which I very much commend to  the Senate, to its prayerful considera tion, because issues of the largest con sequence are at stake.  We do not consider that we have fin ished our work, but only that we have  reached the point where it ought to be  presented for more general consideration  even as the committee proceeds to a spe cific chapter-by-chapter examination.

142,House,96,0.502,1275,2,Mr. DEVINE.," Mr. Speaker, our first  Republican President, whose birthday  we celebrate today, made an important  observation  in his Second Message  to  Congress.  President Abraham Lincoln said:  The dogmas of the quiet past are inade quate to the stormy present .. .. We must  think anew and act anew.  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the dog mas of the Democrat Party, which has  controlled Congress for the past 25 years,  are out of date. The Democrats have  brought our Nation a quarter century  of economic mismanagement.  In that period Federal spending has  increased 700 percent, taxes have climbed  690 percent, and inflation has risen 300  percent.  But, things do not have to be as bad  as they are today. We can change Con gress. We need a Republican Congress  for a change.  VOTE REPUBLICAN, FOR A CHANGE  (Mr. SHUSTER asked and was given  permission to address  the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1980
143,House,96,0.416,1275,2,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, in 1976,  Candidate Carter promised the Ameri can people that he would reduce the rate  of inflation  to 4 percent. He promised  the American people that his economic  policies would  induce  stable  interest  rates. He promised the American people  that he would never increase taxes for  the working people. He promised  the  American people that he would have a  balanced budget by the end of his first  term.  Well, Mr. Speaker, it is now the end  of not only his first term, but also his  last  term, and what do we  find? We  find  a  country  racked  by  an  in flation rate of over 13 percent. We find  interest rates that have soared as high  as 15% percent. We  find  a  proposed  budget for fiscal year 1981 that will raise  the proportion of Federal  revenue  to  GNP to 21.7 percent, the highest, most  confiscatory peace-time burden  in  the  history of the Republic. And we find that  the President's budget projects a deficit  of $15.8 billion for fiscal year 1981, a fig ure that many economic forecasters con sider unrealistically low.  Mr. Speaker, the American people have  the right to know that this high-spend ing, high-deficit, high-tax Government  the result of this Democrat administra tion's policies enacted with the support  of  this democratically controlled Con gress. Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow citi zens  in 1980:  ""Vote Republican, for a  change.""  ",1980
144,House,96,0.371,1275,2,Mr. THOMAS.," Mr. Speaker, the ""crazy  s~ason"" is upon us.  In an article  today by Mr. David  Broder in the Washington Post, he says and I quoteCalifornia Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown,  Jr., who finished a surprisingly strong third  in Maine, will be in New Hampshire Thurs day night  to  try  to repeat his successful  formula here.  As I recall, Governor Brown finished  third in a three-man race, and his sur prisingly  ""successful  formula""  netted  him  less  than  the 15  percent which,  under  the Maine Democratic  caucus  rules, is required to receive any delegates.  So  it  is entirely appropriate  that the  ""success formula"" of the Governor of my  State, Governor ""less  is more"" Brown,  nets him zero delegates.  If this  is February it must be New  Hampshire.  TALKING CHEAP-ACTING  EXPENSIVE  (Mr. GINGRICH asked and was given  permission  to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1980
145,House,96,0.377,1275,2,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, the peo ple in charge of Congress have been talk ing cheap and acting expensive.  For instance, just a week ago, in the  Washington Post the Democratic major ity leader boasted that during the last  4 years the Democrats in Congress have  cut income taxes twice.  Yet during  that tim~the amount  collected from  income  taxes has more  than doubled-from $131 to $268 billion.  Working  American  families  know  taxes are not going down-they are go ing up. Every time the people in charge  of Congress  talk about cutting  taxes,  American families should reach for their  wallets.  At the same time the Democrat leader ship is creating another burst of infla tion. Some people in charge of Congress  actually claim  that  they are  limiting  spending. Yet  they decided  to  spend  $1,060,800, think of that, $1,060,800 just  in this very minute that I speak.  And they will spend that much every  minute this year. Imagine how we could  help working American families  if the  majority in Congress stopped spending  money for just 1 hour-60 minutes.  If Republicans were in charge of Con gress, we could cut inflation and create  jobs for people. We would cut spending  that helps bureaucrats, and hurts work ing families. We would pass a  tax cut  which would mean  lower  taxes-not  higher taxes. For a change in policies,  we need a change in leadership.

146,House,96,0.497,1275,2,Mr. LUNGREN.," Mr. Speaker, everyone  has been  talking about the need for a  change in the Congress after 25 years of  Democratic majority.  We not only cannot afford 25 more  years of a Democratic Congress. We can not afford 4 more years of the Carter ad ministration.  Without the leavening effect of a re sponsible Executive willing to veto irre sponsible  congressional  spending,  our  economy is in a shambles. Indeed, this  debilitating Democratic duo brought us  to the brink of economic disaster.  This  is  their  legacy  in  the past 2  years alone:  In  January  1977,  when  President  Carter took offi.ce, the inflation rate was  4.8 percent. Today it is 13 percent.  In January 1977,  the prime interest  rate was 6.8 percent. Today it is 15.5 per cent.  In January 1977, regular gasoline cost  60 cents a gallon. Today it is about $1.17.  In January 1977, gold cost $125 an  ounce. Since then, it has topped $840 an  ounce.  And in January 1977, when Mr. Carter  took omce,  the average per capita in come  of  the American people ranked  fourth  in  the world. Today  it  ranks  seventh. Mr. Spencer, here is the Dem ocratic  legacy:  the Democratic dollar.  Is there any question that it is time for  a change? We need another team run ning the White House and the Congress.  BUREAUCRACY  GROWS,  DESPITE  PRESIDENT'S PROMISES  (Mrs. SNOWE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and  to  revise and extend her  remarks.)  ",1980
147,House,96,0.091,1275,2,Mrs. SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker,  in 1976,  President Carter made Government re organization a major campaign theme.  Billing himself as a Washington outsider,  he promised  to rid the bureaucracy of  waste and inefficiency. He said he would  duplicate his  reorganization  effort  in  Georgia. He said we would cut the num ber of Federal agencies from 1,900 to 200.  What he said, and what he has actually  done are two different things.  The Federal civilian work force has  actually increased by 40,000 since he took  offi.ce.  He has not decreased the number of  Federal agencies significantly. In fact, he  has created two of the biggest bureau cratic nightmares ever  imposed on an  overregulated public-the Department  of  Energy,  and  the Department  of  Education.  He has hidden much of the growth in  bureaucracy by  ""contracting out""  the  work. It has been estimated that as much  as $10 billion  is wasted each year by  agencies farming out work they should  do themselves.  Unfortunately, President Carter's re organization plan needs reorganizing. He  has not kept the promises he made; he  has just put another crimp in the Gor",1980

RICK NoLAN has announced his retire ment from the House at the end of this  session. His decision to leave office at the  end of only three terms is disappointing  to those of us who have worked closely  with him, for he brought to this body a  very human quality-an understanding  of the needs of rural America and espe cially the needs of the family farmer.  I had  the  fortune, Mr. Speaker,  to  serve with RicK NoLAN on  the House  Committee on Agriculture. As chairman  of the Subcommittee on Family Farms,  Rural Development, and Special Studies,  RICK  led the effort to save the family  farm. It was because of this concern and  leadership  that  the  administration  moved forward in trying to better under stand the structure of American agricul ture. He was an early advocate of the  need  for  a  national  policy on  rural  America. His concern for the loss of this  Nation's most basic natural resources prime  farmland-helped  to bring  the  issue before the American public.

SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAMS  (Mr. PERKINS asked and was given  permission to extend his remarks at this  point in the RECORD and to include ex traneous matter.)  ",1980
155,House,96,-0.343,1314,2,Mr. PERKINS.," Mr. Speaker, last Oc tober,  the Department of Agriculture  published in the Federal Register a set  of proposed regulations implementing an  assessment, improvement, and monitor ing system <AIMS) . The Department de veloped this system in response to pro gram audits conducted by the Office of  Inspector General that unveiled certain  weaknesses  in the fiscal accountability  and meal quality of the school lunch pro gram.  Although the objective of the AIMS  system is to improve program integrity,  State and local administrators are quick  to identify major flows in the system, for  example: First, the Federal sanctions are  overly punitive; second, the system dupli cates existing regulations; third, the im plementation costs will exceed the pro jected $4 million forcing States to absorb  the additional expense; fourth, the re quired paperwork will be excessive and  will seriously dilute the States' technical  assistance  and outreach  efforts;  and  fifth,  the system  is inflexible and will  break down any existing Federal-State local administrative cooperation.  These serious objections prompted the  Subcommittee on Elementary, Secon dary, and Vocational Education to con duct an oversight hearing on the AIMS  proposal on December 12.  Testimony  from the hearing clearly indicated that  the AIMS proposal needs careful exam ination before any final regulations can  be considered.

157,,96,0.283,41,6,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President, the Senate  today is about to complete its work on  one of the most complex and important  legislative measures in recent history the windfall profit tax.  Several Members of the Senate, on sev eral  sides of  this  intricate  issue, are  worthy of special praise in this monu mental legislative effort.  Of course, great credit must go  to  the distinguished chairman of the com mittee, the Senator from Louisiana <Mr.  LONG), for his careful attention to the in tricacies of  this measure. While many  Members on this side of the aisle were  in profound disagreement with him on  many of the aspects of the bill, all of  us, I believe, recognize the great talent  he brings  to  this matter and  to  this  measure. I pay him tribute for his usual  skillful job in managing this bill through  its consideration by the Senate.  No Member deserves  greater credit  than  the distinguished Senator  from  Kansas <Mr. DOLE), who as ranking Re publican on the Finance Committee has  helped guide this legislation through a  long and tortuous process from its first  day to its final passage.  Senator DOLE has been a model of dili gence in this endeavor, devoting precious  time to fashioning a workable and useful  bill even at the expense of his campaign  for the Republican nomination for the  Presidency of the United States.  He has placed the public interest in  this vitally important field above his own  personal interest, and he has earned the  enduring respect and appreciation of the  entire Senate for his devotion to duty  and his talented and tireless work.  I also pay special respect to the dis tinguished Senator from Oklahoma <Mr.  BELLMON) , the ranking member of the  Budget Committee, who has once again  rendered exemplary service to the Senate  and its budgetary process by raising the  important issue of congressional control  over the future use and appropriation of  these tax revenues.  Members of the Senate staff deserving  special mention for their dedicated work  on this legislation include Bob Lighthizer,  minority counsel for the Finance Com mittee; Bob Boyd, minority staff direc tor for the Budget Committee, and his  associate Rod DeArment; and Carol Cox  of the staff of Senator BELLMON.  A great many more people have brought  credit on  themselves  and endlessly complicated enterprise, and  in this  laborious  I commend everyone who played a part  in the consideration of this bill.

158,,96,0.631,41,6,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, time and  time again the Wall Street Journal has  editorialized  against  approval  of  the  massive, falsely labeled, ""windfall profit  tax."" Today's Wall Street Journal car ries another excellent editorial on this  tax, once more asking the question, ""Why  is the United States doing this to itself?""  . As for this so-called windfall profit tax,  it seems to me that logic demands any  Senator to oppose it purely on the basis  of  the energy supply situation in this  country today. I do not need to tell any  Senator  that  it  is dangerous  to  fool  around with the possibility, let alone the  probability, of  increasing even further  our dependence on foreign oil. Instead,  we should be doing everything we can  to increase the production of energy here  at home, and this bill goes 180 degrees  away from that objective.  I  simply cannot  in good conscience  vote for this legislation because it is bad  for the country, it is harmful to the free  enterprise system, and it will be a disas ter for the consumer. This is a chance  for all Senators to put up or shut up be cause how we vote on  this  issue will  determine, first, whether we understand  the free enterprise system; and, second,  whether we believe in it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the editorial entitled, ""Death  of Reason,"" in the March 27, 1980 Wall  Street Journal be printed in the RECORD  at the conclusion of my remarks.  There being no objection, the editorial  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  DEATH OF REASON  Barring a redemptive miracle, the United  States Senate  today will  sacrifice  the na tion's future security to its own unslakable  thirst for revenues. It will gl ve final approval  to  the massive.  falsely  labeled,  ""windfall  profits tax.""  It ls hard for us to understand how the  Congress could actually pass so misguided a  piece of legislation. Admittedly, Washington  has been picking off one major industry a  decade:  the steel  industry with  the price  ""jawboning"" of the 1960s, and the auto in dustry with the safety, emissions and fuel  standards of the 1970s. But even with that  record, we would have  thought  it beyond  belief that Congress would set out to de stroy this industry in this decade, hamstring ing  the domestic oil  industry  just when  energy  ls  a  paramount concern not only  economically but politically and mmtarily.  Looking on the spectacle of Congress slap ping a huge tax on domestic oil production  just when it needs  to reduce oil  imports,  our  friends abroad  look on with alarmed  incredulity. Why ls the United States doing  this to itself? a cabinet member of one ally  asked  us  recently. We  could only  reply,  tongue-tied,  that  simple  logic  sometimes  falls victim to complex political forces.  The evolution of this latest self-inflicted  blow ls bound up in the broader history of  U.S. economic policy through the 1970s. It  began when Congress,  led by many of the  same people who  lead  it today, embraced  wage and price controls as the remedy for  the inflation its overspending had generated,  and finally succeeded in inducing President  Nixon to apply them in 1971. Most of the  controls were blown off by inflation in 1973  and 1974, but the ones on energy continued.  They indeed blossomed into a huge regula tory bureaucracy, the Department of Energy.  The DOE became an instrument for stran gling domestic energy production.  Public frustration with the fruits of this  process-gasoline  lines, rising energy costs  and increased dependence on imports-was  diverted by American political leadership to  the oil industry, which, guided by its tradi tional opportunism, was an easy victim. This  exercise in political cynicism was augmented  by more virulent anti-business, anti-capital ist forces. Soon the attack on oil lost what ever rationality it ever had and ,became a  religious movement bent on punishing the  oil industry and diverting its cash fl.ow into  the public treasury. As it happened, this was  just the ticket for a government that had  through most of the 1970s enormously over spent its budget and generated progressively  worse  inflation. President Carter conceived  the brilliant idea of removing price controls  on domestic crude oil but taxing away most  of  the added  revenues  that he presumed  would fl.ow from letting prices rise above the  ce111ngs. The DOE bureaucracy found ways,  as we noted  in  this column yesterday,  to  preserve and expand  its power even after  decontrol.  The oil  revenues  tax Congress will pass  today-again barring some last-minute con version-will combine with raging inflation  to run  the American crude oil production  industry  into  the ground.  It will  solidify  OPEC's grip on oil prices, leave us politically  and m111tarily exposed from further depend ence on imported oil, drain huge funds out  of the savings/profit pool needed to stimu late  investment and productivity, and  in crease the incentives for inflationary money  creation. To  find  a  similarly  destructive  single piece of legislation, you have to hark  back  to  the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which  helped  throw  the world  into  the Great  Depression.    ",1980
159,,96,-0.192,41,6,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Mr. President,  it  would not be an overstatement to say to  my colleagues in the Senate that the de bate on the windfall profit tax legisla tion has been a very painful one for me.  Being from an oiland gas-producing  State, I have grown up in the midst of  one of the most entrepreneurial indus tries in this country. I have found pro ducers on the whole to be industrious,  and honorable men and women with a  very bullish view on the future of our  country. With this in mind, it was not  hard for me to cosponsor and actively  work for the passage of Senator BENT SEN's independent producer exemption  from the tax. Independents, as the Sen ate is now well aware, do drill 90 percent  of the wildcat wells in the country, and  must depend on the revenues from the  producing ones to continue to reach out  in frontier areas for more discoveries.  The independent producer continues  to be optimistic about the remaining oil  and gas to be produced in the United  States. But as one oil producer has noted,  ""All  the slow rabbits have been shot,""  meaning that the oil and gas that is easy  to find has already been found. To pro duce the less accessible oil will take more  capital. That was the intent of the Bent sen amendment which I supported. Un fortunately, the House in conference was  opposed to the 1,000-barrel exemption.  However,  the Senate was able to work  out some special reductions in the tax  rates for the independents that If eel will  help in the exploration for new reserves.  Mr. President,  the  independent ex wells in its purview. This was important  emption amendment  included stripper  ",1980
160,Senate,96,0.307,93,6,Mr. BELLMON.," Mr. President, mo ments ago, the Senate passed and sent  to  the President for his signature the  largest single revenue measure enacted  by Congress over the 204 year history  of our Nation. This act, labeled the wind fall profit tax, but more aptly designated  the Domestic Crude Oil Excise Tax Act  of 1980,  is estimated to raise $227 bil lion over the next decade by placing an  excise tax on every category of oil pro duced in this country. This is a tax mind  you, in addition to the 46 percent cor porate income tax rate which also ap plies  to every category of oil produced  in the continental United States. Pro ducers and royalty owners also pay reve nue taxes as well as State and Federal  personal income tax.  Mr. President, as we all know,  this  legislation was originally proposed  in  response  to the President's decision to  decontrol crude oil prices as well as to  respond  to reports of what some con sidered as inordinate profits by the ma jor  international oil  companies. The  irony in all this, Mr. President, is that  the measure just passed does not really  impact the  international oil companies  as originally envisioned. However, one  segment of the petroleum industry that  this tax measure will impact is the in dependent producer and royalty owner.  Mr. President, when H.R. 3919 was be fore  the Senate for consideration last  fall, the Senate attempted and succeeded  in shaping a bill th.at struck a balance  between our taxation and energy policy.  By providing a 1,000 barrel per day ex emption from the windfall profit tax to  the  independent producer,  the Senate  bill recognized  the productive capacity  of the independent producer to find and  produce oil and gas in this country. It  specifically  recognized  the undisputed  fact that the independents have a docu mented history of plowing back over 100  percent of their profits into new explora tion and development.  The amendment by Senators BENTSEN  and BOREN to provide a 1,000 b/d inde pendent exemption was agreed to in the  Senate by a vote of 53 to 42. In so doing,  the Senate took a firm position in assur ing the proper incentives for the most  productive segment of the petroleum in dustry so that they might continue to  explore and find additional oil supplies  for this Nation. In this context Mr. Pres ident, the Senate was recommending a  balanced policy which included taxing  those entities most able to absorb the  windfall profit  tax while at the same  time enabling the independent producers  to retain adequate capital to assure con tinued exploration and development.  Unfortunately, Mr. President, when  H.R. 3919 returned to the Senate from  the joint conference committee, the Sen ate's balanced approach had been un done. The 1,000 b/d independent exemp tion from the windfall tax was dropped.  While many  thought  the  conference  committee would arrive at a compromise  as to the number of barrels of independ.  ",1980
161,House,96,0.308,132,6,Mr. HAGEDORN.," Mr. Speaker  this  morning's news from Iran was pa~ticu­ larly distressing. The 54 hostages being  held by the Khomeini terrorists might  not be freed until this summer or later  according to news accounts. This is to:  tally unconscionable, but the American  people also suffer as a result of the hos tage being held at home rather than  those being held abroad.  At home? Yes, we should not forget  the 54th hostage the Iranians are hold ing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  And what is worse, unless we can ne gotiate an early release for all 54 hos tages, Jimmy Carter just might replace  Herbert Hoover for presiding over the  biggest economic disaster in American  history.  The self-imposed hostage at the White  House  is totally isolated from the real  world. But perhaps that is the best place  for him. With farm prices at disaster  levels,  housing  starts at a  standstill  tight credit, soaring energy costs, and ~  freeze on highway projects throughout  the country, the only fantasy island left  is at the White House.  Mr. Speaker, I am no great supporter  of Herbert Hoover, but I believe he has  earned his place in history. Let us all  get behind the efforts to release the 54  American hostages so that Jimmy Carter  would not be able to take Herbert Hoover  off the hook.

Jones, pastor  of St. Mark's A.M.E. Church  in East  Orange, N.J. On Saturday afternoon,  Reverend  Jones and his wife will be  saluted with  a  special  ""Service  of  Thanksgiving""  at  St.  Paul's A.M.E.  Church in East Orange.  The people of the church and com munity will be expressing particular rec ognition for the work of Reverend and  Mrs. Jones throughout his 2% years of  service as president of the New Jersey  Council of Churches. His term in that  position will be completed on May 3.  A letter to me from one of the church  officials says :  The officers and members of St. Mark's  Church are proud of the work and achieve ments of Reverend and Mrs. Jones. The New  Jersey Council of Churches, under Reverend  Jones' presidency, has  taken great strides  toward greater church unity and has lifted  the quality of  life  for all of New  Jersey  citizens. Reverend Jones has  traveled  the  length and breadth of the state without ...  any payment whatsoever.  Reverend  Jones has always been a  t,ruly generous, caring, and skilled leader  in his church and community.  I  am  pleased that he has been able to extend  that  leadership  throughout  the State  of New Jersey. But I and the others who  will gather Saturday will be expressing  appreciation for  the many dimensions  of Reverend Jones' service over all the  years of his work.  He has been dedicated to much more  than the institutions of his community  and  the organization of  the statewide  Council of Churches. His work through  his church and  recently  through  the  council are labors of love, because his  essential devotion  is  to human  rights  and justice.  Reverend Jones is, in the noblest sense  of the term, a moral man and leader. I  will be honored  to  join  in  the salute  Saturday to Reverend Jones, not just for  his successful term as president of the  New Jersey Council of Churches, but for  his continuing contributions to progress  toward justice for his fellow human be ings.

181,,96,-0.473,197,6,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, cancer  is a disease that will strike one out of  four Americans and two out of three  American families. The word ""cancer    is  the diagnosis .. Americans fear the  most.  Yet thanks to the tremendous com mitment our Nation: has made to medi . cal research on how best to diagnose  and  treat  this disease, startling ad vances have been 'made in prolonging  the lives of cancer patient~.   The  Interstate  ~d Foreign Com merce Committee will. soon mark up  H.R. 6522, the Health Research Act of  1980. This bill extends funding for an  additional 3 years to continue research  at NIH into the causes and treatment  of cancer and other serious diseases.  In preparation for that .markup and  further congressional action  to ade quately fund biomedical research for  fiscal years .1981, 1982, and 1983, I am  inserting  in  today's CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD an update on recent break throughs ip cancer tP,erapy. These en couraging statistics were presented by  Dr. Vincent T. DeVita, acting Director  of the National Cancer. Institute at the  American Cancer  Society's Science  Writer's Seminar at Daytona Beach;  Fla., on March 23.  Dr. DeVita's  findings  prove  that  Federal dollars spent on biomedical re searcch have tangible lifesaving results  that benefit tis all.    The article follows:  OPPORTUNITIES IN CANCER TREATMENT  We often hear that cancer is the disease  Americans fear most. A surprising paradox  is that cancer is one of the most curable  chronic diseases in the country today. Full~1  ~8 p«::rcent of more  than  the 1 million  Americans who develop cancer this year can  expect to be cured using currently available  therapies. Even if one subtracts the 400,000  patients with skin cancers and in situ can cers of the uterine cervix, which can be  treated simply by surgery. approximately 41  percent of patients with the more serious  forms of cancer are still curable using one  or more of the three main therapies: sur gery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. By ,  cure we mean that a patient remains free of  disease and has the same life expectancy as  a person who never had cancer.  Our ability to cure cancer is a relatively  recent achievement. Before 1900; few cancer  patients survived their disease. Around the  tum of the century, the principles of cancer  surgery were developed and X-rays were dis covered. These two therapies were able to  take care of local disease <the tumor itself  and lymph nodes that might be involved in  surrounding tissue>. About 33 percent of pa tients were surviving by 1955. Development  of anticancer drugs following World War II  enabled physicians to treat cancer system ically. The use of drugs along with  local  therapies increased the cure rate to the cur rent 41 percent.

In our budget this year, we have   made a major commitment to cancer pre vention. Our research activities in the area  of environmental carcinogenesis have  creased 43 percent between 1978 and 1980,  while  the Institute's total budget has increased only 15 percent.       I would like to discuss just one example of  <>Ur  basic  research efforts  in prevention.  Several years ago NCI epidemiologists pub lished a survey of cancer death rates for the  period 1950 to 1969 for all continental U.S.  counUes: Maps of the United States showing   ""hot spots"" for various cancer sites wer~ a.  part of this survey. Many of you are famil iar with the ""cancer atlas"". Over 40 subse quent epidemiologic studies have addressed  these ""hot spotS.""  One of the survey's findings, for example,  was a higher cancer rate among male resi dents of 39 counties where the primary in  dustry  was  petroleum  manufacture.  'through the Q_il, Chemical and Atomic  Workers Union, NCI scientists gained acces8  to employee health  recotds at 5 specific  plants in Texas. They found increased fre quencies of cancers of the brain and central  nervous system in a large petroleum refin ery where most of the employees are production workers. In another plant that also  produces sulfuric acid, the scientists found  increased frequencies of stomach, skin, and  kidney cancers.

And I  think it will be  extremely helpful to parts of our coun try, particularly the Northeast corridor  which needs further strengthening.  As we know,  throughout our country  the roadbeds, the railroad beds, are in  disastrous condition. The future trans portation needs of our country depend  upon upgrading our railroads.  It is a sad thing that a large line like  the Rock Island Line  is bankrupt and  that thousands of people will be with out jobs. However, part of that has been  taken  care of,  in  that  they have  6  months' severance pay, and after that,  at least $3,000 for retraining.  Yes, there are many reasons why this  bill should be passed, and it does repre sent various sections of  the country. I  regret that the Northeast corridor, al though it goes through the most densely  populated area of our country, is not pay ing. There is some reason why. I hardly  know why that is, why it should not pay  off. But there is one line in this country,  and it involves the area of my dear friend  from south California, and I could un derstand why he supports the bill, be cause it definitely will pay off. It goes, as  I understand it, from San Diego to Los  Angeles to Las Vegas.

Richard Sturgeon,  IBEW  local business  representative,  testified  to  the hardships  suffered by Sioux City, Iowa, workers when  imports forced Zenith Corp.  to eliminate  5,000  jobs and close several plants in late  1977 after the OMA with Japan took effect.  The OMA with Japan, which came  too  late to save the .jobs of many thousands of  workers, did cut Japanese color TV imports.  However, Taiwan and Korea made up -for  the Japanese cutback and 1978 was a near  record year for TV  imports. OMAs with  Taiwan and Korea were signed in 1979 but  the first two years of the relief program had  already been undermined and the domestic  industry has had less than a year of effec tive relief against the five years recommend ed by the ITC and the three granted by  President Carter.    Dawson, an engineer who has spent 32  years wiih Corning Glass, testified that al though the OMAs have enabled the indus try. to survive  the results ""have been far  from what he hoi:)ed.""

MICHEL  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 31, 1980  e ",1980
191,,96,0.372,392,6,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, the Chi cago Tribune magazine recently car ried an article about our distinguished  colleague, HENRY HYDE. As a  fell ow  Representative  from  Illinois  and a  long-time admirer of HENRY'S legisla tive and oratorical skills, I am delight ed to place this article in the RECORD.  At this point I wish to insert in the  RECORD, ""Ever. the Thunder From the  Right""  from  the Chicago Tribune,  March 23, 1980.  EVER THE 'THuNDER FROM THE RIGHT  IN AJf OLD YET  HENRY HYDE, ANCHORED FIRMLY  FASHIONED  CONSERVATISM,  HASN'T  SHAKEl'f THE ""ONE ISSUE"" IMAGE BROUGHT ON  BY HIS MILITANT OPPOSITION TO ABORTION  <By Raymond Coffey>  It was  ""almost an accident      dumb  luck     we fell into it,"" Henry J. Hyde re calls now of the day that put him into the  history books and his name into the Ameri can political vocabulary.  This was also an occasion that sent bat tling Bella Abzug and some of her militant-  ly feminist congressional colleagues ""right  through the roof,"" Hyde recalls with linger ing and unfaded relish. The date .was June  24, 1976, and Hyde was an obscure freshman  congressman from Chicago's  western sub urbs, sitting on the floor of the House of  Representatives with :Rep. Robert Bauman  <R., Md.) when along came a bill .that in .eluded a $50-million 'appropriation for abor tions for poor women under the Medicaid  program.  Both Hyde. and Bauman favor a constitu tional amendment  to ban abortions and  thus negate the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court  decision  that  largely  undid  state  laws  against abortion. But the chances, if any,  for getting that kind of amendment into the  Constitution are years down the road.  The $50-million  appropriation, though,  struck both representatives as at least an  opportunity to make a point. So they sat  down and ""scribbled out in longhand, right  on the spot,"" an amendment to the bill to  bar federal funding of Medicaid abortions  unless the mother's life was endangered.  Bauman was for some reason reluctant to  introduce the amendment, so Hyde ll'..arched  up to the clerk's table and put it in himself.  No one was more surprised than Hyde when  the amendment was adopted. Hyde says he  and Bauman had Just wanted a  recorded  vote to test the strength of anti-abortion  sentiment and force members of Congress to  stand up and be counted. ""We didn't.know it  <the strength) was there.'' Hyde said.  That amendment or a compromise version  has been passed  in both  the House and  Senate every year since. J\nd even though,    ",1980
192,,96,-0.211,457,6,Mr. CANNON.," Mr. President, I yield  myself 5 minutes.  Mr. President, the Senator is not argu ing the procedural matters of abandon ment. He is arguing the validity of the  abandonment  itself,  the determination  that an abandonment should be madp.  The abandonment provisions of  this  bill are designed to accomplish two major  objectives:  Significantly  reducing  the  time spent processing such cases at the  Commission and improving the process  by which abandoned lines can be sub sidized. No changes are made  in  the  standards under which the ICC decides  whether or not to grant the abandon ment of railroad lines.  The Senator  is simply arguing  should not abandon  some  lines,  ought to continue service.  But in  the committee hearings, Mr.  President,  there was no opposition  to  these procedural reforms the committee  adopted. For abandonment applications  which  are  opposed,  the Commission  would be required  to decide  the cases  within 9 months  instead of  the 2 or  3 years--or even more-it now  takes.  These procedural  reforms will benefit  everyone-for neither the communities  involved nor the railroads benefit from  protracted  litigation.  The  Cochran  amendment would eliminate these pro cedural reforms and abandonment cases  would continue to be as long and expen sive as they now are.  It is worth emphasizing that neither  S. 1946 nor  the Cochran amendment  would alter the substantive legal stand ards under which abandonment cases  are decided. The only question is how  long it takes to make the decision. Be cause procedural reform  is  long over due, this amendment should be rejected.  Mr. President, what we are trying to  do in this bill is the adoption of proce dural  reforms  to help make  it more  favorable than it is today.  they  they  We should not be  rolling  the clock  back to preserve the status quo.  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder  of my time.  ",1980
193,,96,0.2,457,6,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President, I  certainly am very aware of the concerns  of the Senator from Mississippi, which  he has addressed.  The State  of Kansas  is  presently  plagued with a total cessation of service  of one of the major carriers of the Mid west-the Rock  Island Railroad. Re cently, the Northeast and the Northwest  suffered a  serious blow with massive  abandonments by the Milwaukee Rail road.  Stretching out  the  time  to make a  case against an abandonment does noth ing more than prolong the inevitable.  I  think that making a  railroad  line  operate that desires  to abandon for 2  or 3 years is a case that is going to not  only add a financial drain to the rail road and deprive it of needed financial  resources, but  it places an additional  financial burden on the shippers along  that.line.  Prolonging the inevitable is not only  counterproductive  to  shippers  and  States, but, certainly, it is, I think, detri mental to the railroads.  Maintaining the status quo of stretch ing abandonment proceedings before the  ICC for an average of 2Y2  years must  not be perpetuated.  I  feel that the Senator from Missis sippi's amendment, which  is pending  before us  today, would do  just that.  When  the Railroad Transportation  Policy Act began at  the beginning of  this Congress,  it was essentially a de:..  regulation bill, designed to revitalize the  railroads  and help  them  aggressively  seek new markets and growth with the  economy.  What  this  really does do  is  simply  shorten the period of time the case can  be made.  I think we have taken a step, in this  legislation, that will be a productive one  for both the railroads and the shippers.  I urge my colleagues to consider this  in the light of the fact that if we are  going to maintain a vital transportation  system, we are going to have to do all  we can  to strengthen the railroads as  well as add protection for the communi ties which will be losing service.  I would be glad  to yield  time.  ",1980
194,,96,0.287,457,6,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent that Senator STEN NIS  be added as a  cosponsor  to  this  amendment.  ",1980
195,,96,0.391,483,6,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, the  posture and strength of the United States  in world affairs has been severely threat ened by the recent events in Iran and  Afghanistan-not  to mention  the  in creasing subversive activities of Commu nist nations in Africa, Latin American,  Southeast Asia, and  the Middle East.  This is a matter of grave concern to me,  as I believe it should be to all Americans.  It appears that some of our Nation's  leaders have made the very dangerous  mistake of allowing  themselves  to be  lulled into a state of complacency. These  individuals have  failed  to  realize  the  grave threat that communism poses to  our freedom. Being faced with the reality  of  the current Afghanistan situation,  they are now shocked and dismayed.  Mr. President, we must establish new  polices which will strengthen our posture  in the world. We must bolster our mili tary forces to demonstrate to our allies,  as well to our enemies, that we intend  to remain strong-strong enough to as sist our friends, or  take any required  retaliatory action to preserve our free dom.  Mr. President, the goal of the Soviet  Union is to control the entire world. As  long as communism exists, it is a threat  to all free people.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a concurrent resolution on this  subject, adopted by the General Assembly  of the State of South Carolina, be printed  in the RECORD at the conclusion of my  remarks.  ",1980
196,House,96,-0.427,561,6,Mr. NEDZI.," The gentleman has accu rately stated the case. There is no pro vision for any kind of expenditure on  the part of the Federal Government with  respect to this legislation. As a matter  of fact, the Congressional Budget Office  has been asked to comment on the legis lation and has also given us a statement  to that effect, that there is no impact on  the Federal budget, no adverse impact.  There may well be a very favorable im pact as time goes on because of the job  creation.  ",1980

201,House,96,0.277,574,6,Mr. SEBELIUS.," Mr. Speaker, reserving  the  right  to object,  I  do  so at  this  moment for one purpose, and that is to  note the fact that S. 2427 gives the Sec retary the authority to do almost any thing with loans as far as trying to at tract  noncompliance  people  into  the  farmer-owned  reserve. The House bill  that we just reported out, H.R. 6878, pro vides that interest may not be waived on  any loan for the first year. I was wonder ing if the gentleman could tell me why  we are taking up the Senate bill rather  than  the House  bill  that  has  that  feature?  ",1980
202,,96,-0.355,678,6,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, I am be coming  increasingly  alarmed  by  the  Federal Reserve Board's high  interest  rate policy. As you know, this policy is  said  to be designed  to slow  inflation.  The  traditional  economic wisdom  at  work in this case says that by creating  high enough  interest  rates, you  force  farmers,  homebuilders,  consumers,  housewives, and small business men and  women to retrench, to cut back on pur chases of goods and services. That cre ates a recession which finally causes in flation to slow down. I say, ""finally,"" Mr.  President, because this debilitating re cession-style economic remedy for infla tion can take years to work.  I,  for one, am not willing  to wait  years while a major recession  ravages  the farmers and rages on the farms and  storefronts of America for  the Federal  Reserve Board's recession policy to work.  And, I am not even convinced this policy  will work at all. The theories being fol lowed by the Fed wer.e developed for an other time and another place. They are  unrealistic, today, and dangerously out  of tune with reality. Curiously enough,  in fact,  the Fed's anti-inflation tight money policy actually is accelerating in flation. To the extent high interest rates  have  impacted consumer or wholesale  price indexes, it has served only to in crease them. The Fed's soaring interest  rates and mortgage costs have been re flected directly in the Consumer Price  Index. Businesses just pass on the sky high cost of borrowing in higher prices,  as well. And that causes the CPI to rise  even further. But the Fed's misguided  policy  is, and will  increasingly  in  the  future,  have  an  even more  serious  effect.  TENNESSEE FARMERS  As I noted last Wednesday, March 26  in comments before the Senate, I hav~  talked with literally hundreds of Ten nessee farmers in recent weeks. They are  being pushed against the wall by ruinous  interest rates on the seed and fertilizer  loans  they must have  to plant  this  spring. They are being pushed so far in  some cases that they may simply drop  out of agriculture this year to cut their  losses. That decision by Tennessee cot ton farmers and soybean growers-and  farmers  elsewhere,  as well-will only  aggravate inflation. It will reduce sup plv, forcing prices for food, clothing, and  other byproducts up even faster. It will  markedly slash our export earnings from  agricultural sales abroad-earnings that  could otherwise  total $37  billion  this  year. The loss of these exports and the  dollars they bring home will force  the  dollars' value down overseas and push up  prices for all types of  imports, thereby  creating more inflation.  In fact, the more I  review the infla tionary impact of the Fed's mislabeled  anti;..inflationary  high  interest  policy,  the more incensed I become. Scratching  beneath  its  surface  reveals  that  the  Fed's policy may well cause more infla tion, not less, as it is designed to do.  Two things are for sure: It has caused  chaos in the domestic bond and mort gage markets and is hurting American  citizens in the pocketbook. I chaired a  Senate Budget Committee hearing last  fall, and the chorus of complaints was  virtually unanimous, at a time when the  interest rate was at 12 percent, that the  Fed's high interest policy was doing far  more harm than good.  A CALL TO REDUCE INTEREST RATES  On March 7, I telegramed the Chair man of  the Federal Reserve System's  Board of Governors, Paul Volcker, urg ing a reduction in interest rates and a  cap  on  speculative  borrowing.  Last  Wednesday, March 26, I joined with the  distinguished chairman of  the Senate  Appropriations Committee  in sponsor ing Senate Resolution 392, calling, again,  on Mr. Volcker and his colleagues at the  Fed's Board of Governors to reduce in terest rates.  JEC ALTERNATIVE  But we must do more; we must see to  it, Mr. President, that the basic system,  the mechanism, for dealing with infia tiion is a realistic, effective one; one that  offers us  the realistic hope of slowing  inflation. We need an alternative to the  slow, outdated, ineffective recessionary,  anti-inflation policy of the Fed. And, I  believe, our colleagues on the Joint Eco nomic Committee of  the U.S. Senate  have come up with that alternative.  Beginning with  their annual  report  last year, the Joint Economic Commit tee has sought to focus our attention,  and the attention of the entire Nation,  on  the supply  side of our  two-sided  economy. Since the thirties, economists  and I must confess, politicians also have  only  looked at the demand side. They  focused on techniques, primarily mone tary and  fiscal policy,  for  fine-tuning  aggregate demand. The supply side of  the economy was ignored with the hope  that it always fluctuated with demand.  Mr. President, I  think we are a  lot  smarter today. We have learned-in good  part due to the pathbreaking Joint Eco nomic Committee work-that the supply  side is as important as the demand side  in dealing with inflation. As  the JEC's  distinguished chairman has repeatedly  pointed out, it makes far more economic  sense to fight inflation by increasing the  supply of goods and services rather than  by slashing demand. Slashing  the de mand for goods and services-the pur pose of the Fed's present high interest  rate money policy--creates a whole host  of problems that the Bentsen/ JEC ap proach bypasses.  The Fed wants  to suppress demand  and push people out of work. It wants to  take people off the assembly line and put  them in the welfare line.  INCREASED  PRODUCTIVITY NEEDED  take, Mr.  The JEC approach would take people  off the welfare line and put them on the  assembly line. Frankly, that makes a lot  more sense to me, Mr. President, a  lot  more sense. This new approach to fight ing inflation has received laudatory re views  for  the  insight  it has provided.  Yet,  in retrospect, the JEC solution is  simple and straight! orward:  Incentives  are established to spur production and  investment designed to expand our Na tion's productive capacity. In particular,  efforts to promote productivity in both  the private sector and the public sector a key concern of mine-are stressed as  the cornerstone of this innovative policy.  The Bentsen approach has opened a  new door for us. It shines a light down  the dark tunnel through which the Fed eral Reserve Board of Governors wan ts  the American people to walk. It offers us  an option, an alternative  to  the Fed's  path of rising unemployment and years  of slow growth and decrease our static  productivity.  It is an option we should  President.  The question is how best to turn this  Nation around. How can we expose the  outdated Fed policy as unnecessary, and,  indeed, even dangerous, and replace it  with  the  supply-oriented  Bentsen  alternative.  The first step, one we are discussing  now, is to rivet the administration's at tention on our dissatisfaction with the  Fed and our intention to follow the JEC  approach. We must  give  the White  Hous~. the Fed, and the country, indeed,  all Americans, a clear, hard sign that  we are not willing to sit still for soaring  interest  rates, a debilitating  recessi.on  and rising unemployment when the JEC  has a better, a much better approach.  Mr. President, I commend the distin guished chairman of the Joint Economic  Committee, the Senator from Texas (Mr.  BENTS""F:N) , for the fine work he has done  with thls committee. Senator BENTSEN  has been diligent and innovative in an  effort to find a way out of the economic  problems we are experiencing.  I commend him, as one of his col leagues, for the diligence, the foresight,  and the perception he has exhibited.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have printed in the RECORD an  editorial  related  to  the  report of  the  Jo~nt Economic Committee which was  published in the March 20, 1980, edition  of the Commercial Appeal and entitled  ""A Second Opinion.""  There being no objecti.on, the editorial  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  A SECOND OPINION  One reason our economy is a.111ng  is  its  aging industrial plant. This 111 can't be cured  by budget surgery and the other nostrums  prescribed by President Carter. What can  help is a tax cut.  Not just any cut will do, however. It must  be a  tax cut to encourage investment and  productivity.  This nation's productivity-or output per  worker per hour-is in decline, and it will  be until substantial infusions of money a.re  forthcoming from a nation saving at record low rates. But today's record-high  interest  rates-intended to discourage inflation-a.re  ",1980
203,Senate,96,0.589,704,6,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President,  I  shall support  the motion  to recommit  the nominations to the Panama Canal  Commission to the Senate Foreign Rela tions Committee. By doing so I am not  casting an aspersion on  the nominees  but, rather, on the Panama Canal Treaty  itself.  My distinguished colleagues will recall  that nine U.S. Senators were defeated in  their reelection bids in 1978. Of these,  eight had voted for the disgraceful Car ter-Torrijos Panama Canal Treaties. I  believe that the voters in 1980 will again  show that they have not forgotten the  giveaway of our canal in Panama.  Our country has only begun  to feel  the effects of the disastrous decision of  this body  in approving  these  treaties.  Marxist  elements  throughout  Latin  America perceive this American retreat  as a sign of weakness. They see correctly.  Marxist subversion and  terrorism are  growing by  leaps and bounds as  they  sense in our Government a growing lack  of will to resist them.  Nicaragua has  fallen  to  a  largely  Marxist coup. El Salvador is next on the  target  list,  followed closely by Guate mala. The horror of  the  situation  is  heightened by the fact that the Carter  State Department appears to be working  primarily to undermine the position of  the anti-communist elements  in  these  endangered countries. According to the  Wall Street Journal, our newly appointed  Ambassador  to  El  Salvador,  Robert  White, has gone so far as to attack El  Salvador's business community as  the  source of much of the violence currently  taking place  in  that country.  In  the  words of one El Salvadoran business man:  We knew the U.S. was trying to find some one to blame for the violence in El Salvador  but  in our worst  nightmares, we  never  thougfht it would point at us.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have the complete text of this  article printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 1, 1980)  U.S.  IN EL  SHOCKS BUSINESSMEN  SALVADOR  BY .ACCUSING THEM OF FuNDING VIOLENCE  (By Beth Nissen)  ""We knew the U.S. was trying to find some one to blame for the violence in El Salvador,""  says a member of the business community  in the Central American nation, ""but in our  worst nightmares, we never thought it would  point at us.""  The  remaining members  of  the once domina.nt Salvadoran business community  expressed shock at U.S. Ambassador Robert E.  White's denunciation of them for their role  in the political violence that has k1lled more  than 700 this year. In a speech Friday before  the San Salvador American Chamber of  Commerce, Mr. White accused the businessmen of financing ""hit squads"" and killing  and torturing opponents of the right.  Mr. White offered a ""working hypothesis""  that right-wing political groups are responsi ble for the March 24 assassination of Arch bishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero,  a  popular  champion of human rights.  ""I'll tell you on good authority that sec tors on the left were surprised by the arch bishop's death,"" Mr. White told the assem bled businessmen. ""They didn't know how to  react. If you have a plan to kill someone,  you also have a plan to exploit that situa tion. The left didn't.""  With or without such a plan, reaction to  the prelate's death was violent. Dozens of  people were k1lled  in demonstrations  last  week, and at lea.st 40 died during an emo tional  funeral  for  the archbiShop Sunday,  when an explosion and gunfire set off a pan icked stampede among the 80,000 mourners.  VICTIM OF MISINFORMATION  The sources of the explosion and gunfire  were undetermined, although both  leftist  and rightist extremists were blamed. ""How  can  you  possibly  assign  blame  for  this  chaos?"" asked Jose Eduardo Palomo, presi dent of the National Association of Private  Enterprise,  the country's leading business  organization. ""Mr. White's statements have  made me a target for everyone. If anything  happens to me, he's going to be responsible.  I wm be one more victim of U.S. misinfor mation.""  There has already been one such victim,  but a decidedly live one. Mr. White, who has  been ambassador in this embattled country  for only a few weeks, surprised his business  audience by announcing and deploring the  death of  leftist  leader Juan Chacon. Mr.  Chacon turned up to hold a news conference  only hours later.  Despite the damaging mistake, which the  American embassy suggests was a deliber ate attempt  to embarrass  the ambassador  and  the U.S.,  the State Department has  strongly backed Mr. White's harsh criticism  of the Salvadoran business community.  ""It's quite clear that the right wing  is  guilty of  some very  serious  terrorism,"" a  State Department official says. ""Do you think  the  left  is  going  in  for  great  collective  suicide? If some members of Mr. White's  audience are upset, maybe they are feeling  a little guilty.""  Members of  that audience,  reached by  telephone yesterday, insisted they are feel ing  only  frightened  and  betrayed.  ""We  thought the U.S. would defend free enter prise,"" one  coffee  grower  says.  ""Now we  are made to fear  the Yankees as much as  the Communists-maybe more, because they  are an unexpected enemy.""  SUPPORT FOR JUNTA  The wealthy elite who once practically  owned and ran this tiny, coffee-rich country  didn't exuect the U.S. to sci strongly support  the moderate milii'ary-civ111an junta  that  took power  last October  from  right-wing  President Carlos Humberto Romero.  To the businessmen's dismay, the U.S. ap proved and supported the junta's recent ex propriation of about 60 % of the country's  richest private farms and the nationalization  of the banking system. And last week, the  Agency for International Development an nounced  that El Salvador will receive $13  million in U.S. aid. ""Next, the U.S. wm just  send  in  the Marines  to  k111  anyone  in a  three-piece suit,"" a bitter former landowner  says.  Mr. White's broad condemnation of Sal vadoran businessmen promi;>ted some to de fend themselves by admitting the limits of  their political involvement. ""Of course I have  Played a role in this tragedy,"" one we.£1,lthy  businessman  says.  ""Like many,  I  paid  to  have my worke:r;s propagandized against the  lies of the left, and I gave money l suspected  would go for guns. And, yes, I think a few of  to  ",1980

As victory followed victory,  they  gave us not just thrills but a conta gious excitement that infected us all.  Charles O. Finley, owner of the Oak  land Athletics, said that -'""sweat plus  sacrifice equals success."" I think that  maxim can very appropriately be ap plied to  the Spartans. During  the  course of the seasori, they displayed  all  the qualities of  true champions.  They sweated and sacrificed and sacri ficed and sweated.  In  the words of  coach Randy Maddox,  his  players  simply  .... worked  and worked  and  weren't going to lose."" They kept on  fighting and never lost sight of their  objective. And when victory  finally  was theirs, they accepted it with hu mility and grace.  Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues  will want to join me in offering con gratulations to the Laurel High School  Spartans for their superior perform ance throughout the 19'79-80 season~ I  know, too, they wm want to wish this  exemplary team continued success in  future years. And most of all, Mr.  Speaker,  I know my colleagues will  want  to  Join me  ~n thanking  the  Laurel Spartans for the spirit and ex citement they brought the residents of  my area. They gave us something to  cheer about and for that we are most  grateful.  Like  the  U.S.  Olympic  hockey team, they are champions in  the finest sense of the word.e  THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE  OF ISRAEL  HON. STEVEN -D.

206,,96,0.687,795,6,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to  call to the attention of my colleagues  a  recent column by William Safire ..  Mr. Safire's column discusses GovEtr nor Reagan's views on Israel, views  which I share. Governor Reagan real izes the importance of Israel as a stra tegic ally in the world and does not  merely mouth a  lot of trite expres sions about the special United States Israel relations which a lot of other   politicians speak about. Israel and the  United States are, very important to  one another in a world where Soviet  infiuence 18 growing, particularly  in  the Middle East. I want to commend  7623  Mr. Safire for hfs fine presentation of  Governor  Reagan'sviews  on  the  Middle East situation and his strong  commitment! to Israel. The column ap peared  in  the New York Times of  March 24"" 1980. l urge rhy colleagues  to read this interesting essay:  ~EA.GAN ON ISJtAE1.  <By William Safire>  Ronald Reagan, campaigning in New York  City last week, met for a half hour with a  group of Jewish leaders brought together by  Albert A. Spiegel of Los Angeles, a Reagan  campaign vice chairman.  .  ""If there's one statement I'd like you to  remember, it's thiS,""' said the likely Republi can nominee. ""In my Administration, there  will be no more betrayals of friends and  allies by the United States.""  The questioning went to that point. How  would he, as President, have instructed his  U.N. Ambassador to vote on the resolution  condemning Israel and ordering it to dis mantle settlements on the West Bank and  in Jerusalem?  ""I would have directed the Ambassador to  vote no,"" Reagan. replied~ ""This Administra tion  should  rescind  its vote,  and  there  should be an investigation into who makes  our Mideast policy and what it is. The West  Bank should be a decision worked out by  Jordan and Israel: 1 would never have sup ported dismantling.""  One questioner-a Democl'atic officehold er-evidently wanted to  see  if Governor  Reagan had been  reciting  some  tough sounding words, or if he understood the dip lomatic consequences of them. ""An undivid ed Jerusalem"" is an ambiguous phrase-to  the U.N., it mea.ris ""international control"":  in terms of sovereignty, which is what.the  dispute is really; aboat, where did Reagan  stand?  ""I mean that the sovereignty is Israel's,""  Reagan said, and repeated, it in a way that  could not be mistaken: '.'An undivided city  of Jerusalelll means sovereignty for Israel  over that city.""    No hedging;  that was  refreshing. One  worry expressed to Reagan was  that the  State Department had a way of capturing  Presidents after elections.  ~1 lack a great  deal of confidence in the present State De partment,"" Reagan allowed. ""I think  the  State Department should represent the poli cies of the President-they're not in busi-  ness for themselves.""  He said all the right-wing things: ""I be lieve in the right of settlements in the West  Bank."" On the P.L.0.-which will surely be  recognized  if Mr. -Carter is re-elected-he  told an interviewer later that afternoon: ""I  don't see any reason to negotiate with a ter rorist group."" If the P.L.O. were to embrace  U.N. Resolution 242, ""I'd still want to know  whether  they  represent  the Palestinian  people they claim to represent."" His mind set  is wholly different from  that of Mr.  Carter's coterie of Arabists.  Some of the Jewish leaders, having been  burned by assurances made wh~n Carter  was a candidate, wondered if Mr. Reagan  would stand by Israel In December as he  was doing in March. After proving to them selves that th~:)' could ask questions about  U.S. domestic subjects,. the Jewish leaders  came back to the p<)tnt of erosion of White  House support for Israel.  Reagan did not etve them the customary  pap that candidates &eneraly  ladle out to  Jews about Israel-the special relationship.  the moral obligation, the iUfity hang-ups of  the world after the Holocaust. Instead, as a  long-time  realist about Soviet  intentions,  this conservative leader spoke in terms of  the U.S. stratE'.~c fI:lterest in. ~he world:  ",1980
207,,96,-0.27,808,6,Mr. PREYER.," Mr. Speaker, Mr.  DINGELL placed in the March 19, 1980,  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a letter from  Robert Russell, Director of the Coun cll  on Wage  and  Price  Stability  man of the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission, concerning the inflation to Charles CUrtis, Chair  <COWPS>,  ary impacts of incremental pricing of  natural gas. Mr. SToCKMAl'f and I have  introduced a bill, H.R. 5862, to repeal  the incremental pricing provisions of  the Natural Gas Polley Act of 1978  spond to Mr. DINGELL'& statement.  In his preface to the COWPS letter,  Mr. DINGELL stated that the Wharton  impelled to re therefore feel  and I  April 2, 1980  As  Econometric  Forecasting As$ociates  <WEFA>, which has prepared the only  comprehensive analysis to date of this  subject.. had acknowledged errors  in  their study. That study, dated Febru ary 1980, concluded that a three-tier  incremental pricing system would be  infiationary. Mr. Speaker, I am at a  loss to understand how Mr. DINGELL  could make this statement~ since at no  time has WEFA ever acknowledged  any errors in their analysis.  regards  the COWPS  letter  to  Chairman Curtis, Mr. Russell properly  advised  the FERC to        proceed  cautiously with phase  II, and  seek  ways  to mitigate  the proposal's ad verse effects."" COWPS also concluded  that they could not endorse the re sults of the WEFA analysis because it  was based on assumptions and specifi cations with which  they  ""cannot  agree.'' WEFA is now rerunning their  macroeconomic model  to  accommo date the advice and changes requested  by administration economists, includ ing COWPS, and  the effect of  the  recent outline of rule II proposed by  the FERC staff. Initial indications are  that all  the conclusions reached by  the original Wharton study are sus tained by  this new series of model  runs; nainely, that mcremental pricing  will cause infiation, will reduce GNP,  and will .cause substantial unemploy ment cpmpared to the repeal of title II  of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.  I believe you will be interested in a  March 14  letter from the American  Gas Association to Mr. Russell, which  not only  responds  letter. to  FERC but also discusses the rerun of  the Wharton model. The text of this.  letter follows:  to  his  AloluCAB OAS AsSOCIATIO!f,  Arlinoton. Va., .lta.n:h 14, 1980-.  Mr. R .. ROBERT RUSSELL,  Director, Council on Wage and Price Stabil  ity, Washington, D.C.  DEAR MR. RUSSELL: I have read your letter  to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission er Curtis regarding COWPS views on incre mental pricing. As you are aware, our staffs  have had extensive meetings and discussions  on this subject over the past several weeks  since Wh""11;on Econometric Forecasting As sociates <'WEFA> completed its analysis on  contract with A.O.A. concluding that signifi.  cant inflation will be induced by Phases. I  and II incremental pricing togeth.er.  _..  After a very careful review of your letter  to FERC, I am convinced that you acted  prematurely  in  f orwatdlng  to FERC  a  COWPS position on incremental pricing at  this  time. While your letter properly re  quests FERC to ""proceed cautiously with  Phase II, and seek ways to mitigate the pro  posal's a.averse effect"",  it wrongly down plays the role of macroeconomic modeling  as a tool to help ascertain inflationary im pacts and concludes that incremental pric ing ""is unlikely to increase inflation signifi.  cantly"".    We  have  several major problems with  your letter. First, there was an underst~d­ ing between our staffs that we would com  plete a Joint analysis on the inflationary im  pacts of incremental pricing before COWPS  took a definitive position.

208,Senate,96,-0.091,847,6,Mr. TALMADGE.," Mr. President, to re duce the economic uncertainties being  faced by the Nation's pork producers  I  am today submitting a resolution under  which the National Academy of Sciences  would make a comprehensive review of  a~l scientific information relating to the  risks and benefits of using nitrites.  All of our agricultural producers each  day face a multitude of risks. Diseases,  weather, insects, surpluses, and shifting  consumer preferences are among  the  problems  they  face. Over  the  past  decade, however, no group of farmers  has endured more continuing problems  than the Nation's pork producers.  The press their product has received  resulted in declining demand. Only after  a long period of hard work were the pro ducers able  to begin  to moderate  the  slide and then turn ~round pork con sumption.  Ten years ago the price of hogs slipped  to 10 cents a pound. This drove thou sands of producers out of business. Those  who managed to stay in business were  later hit with the effects of the Russian  grain purchase and the short crops of  1974 that pushed feed prices to record  levels.  Our swine producers have been hit  with a new disease problem-pseudo rabies-that  takes  a  devastating  toll.  Producers are also haunted by the spec tre of African swine fever now in the  Caribbean and South America.  However,  the economic and natural  problems that pork producers face are  minor  in comparison  to  the problems  caused by Government regulations. A few  years ago, the Food and Drug Adminis tration began an examination of the use  of various animal drugs, many of which  are vital  to hog production. This has  added uncertainty. The Food and Drug  Administration and the Department of  Agriculture have increased their moni toring activities for drug residues even  though  there  is widesoread  scientific  opinion that some of FDA's analytical  techniques are not reliable. This not only  causes uncertainty, but it has resulted  in several major economic losses.  The most serious threat to hog pro ducers, however, comes  from  the  two  pronged attack of the Department of Ag riculture and FDA against nitrites, a  product that has been used in the pre serving and processing of meats for thou sands of years.  Much of our pork  is processed and  preserved using nitrites. They are criti cal in the production of bacon and the  prevention of botulism. Over  the past  2 years there has been a concerted at tack on the use of nitrites. Much of this  results from. the emotion-laden opposi tion against all food additives regardless  of their function or of their importance  to public health.  One study suggested a possible link be tween nitrites and cancer. I would note  that tpe principal researcher, Dr. New berne at the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, carefully qualified his find ings as to their implications for policy.  We have had continued debate about ni trites but again without evidence of fact.  In hearings  that were held by one or  our  subcommittees,  the  following  ex change occurred between Senator LEAHY,  the subcommittee chairman, and two wit nesses, who are scientists:  Senator LEAHY. Do we run a greater risk  from  the addition of nitrites to foOd  than  from what occurs naturally, generally in the  United States, in vegetables and other sub stances?  Dr. LIJINSKY. Yes.  Dr. WEISBURGER. There I would say cate gorically, ""No.""  It is evident that there is no scientific  consensus on this issue. At this time, the  N ewberne study is being reviewed by a  panel of scientific experts. I think their  findings have already been documented  in a GAO review as well as preliminary  reports from the scientists on the review  panel. In essence,  they are suggesting  that there are inadequacies in the study  design and with the conclusions. Yet our  pork industry continues to endure un certainty because of the doubts raised.  Mr. President, it is imperative that we  establish once and for all the benefits  and risks of nitrites. The use of nitrites  as a preservative and processing agent  is important to consumers as well as to  pork producers. The role of Government  should not be one that creates uncer tainty and confusion. We should move  to find answers  the questions  that  have been raised. This is precisely what  my resolution is designed to do. The res olution calls for a comprehensive review  by the National Academy of Sciences of  all pertinent scientific information re lating to the risks and benefits associ ated with human exposure to nitrites.  I am pleased that 15 of my colleagues  are cosponsors of the resolution. I urge  the Senate to agree  the resolution  without delay.   to  to  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED FOR  PRINTING  FEDERAL RADIATION PROTECTION  COUNCIL-S. 1938  AMENDMENT NO.  1692  (Ordered to be printed and ref erred to  the Committee  on Governmental Af fairs.)

210,Senate,96,0.078,873,6,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, for several  days over the past 2 weeks, the county  commissioners  of my home county Allegheny County, Pa.-have been hold ing hearings in connection with the de velopment of  a State  implementation  plan <SIP) as required under the Clean  Air Act.  I would like to share with my distin guished colleagues the remarks at those  hearings of David M. Roderick, chairman  of the United States Steel Corp. I ask  that the text of Mr. Roderick's remarks,  which point out some of the  tradeoffs  between attaining environmental and  economic goals, be printed in full in the  RECORD.  The text follows:  TESTIMONY BY DAVID M. RODERICK  My name  is Dave Roderick, chairman of  the board of  the United States Steel Cor poration. I'm pleased to have this opportu nity  to  testify  at  today's  hearings ...  especially since we at U.S. Steel have a vital  stake in the provisions included in the State  Implementation Plan. I want to assure you  today that it's one of our company's major  goals  to control emissions  from our  steel  producing operations in a manner consi:>tent  with  the essential principles of  the 1977  Clean Air Act amendments. We are  firmly  committed, in principles and in practice, to  improving air quality and protecting  the  public health.  But it's also the goal of U.S. Steel to con tinue producing  the highest quality  steel  products, both  to keep our facllitles  eco nomically vi111ble and to provide the related  opportunities for employment and prosperity  in our neighboring communities.  I'm well aware that what I have  to say  here today may be very different from some  of the testimony you'll be hearing later on.  And,  I'm sure  that during  the course of  these hearings you'll hear industry accused  of ""dragging its feet"" in meeting 'clean air  standards. That's a  reckless charge, and  I  suppose that I could make a few ""reckless""  charges of my own.  But today I  think it's vital that we put  aside the rhetoric of confrontation and talk  about some basic realities. All of us wan't  the air we breathe  to be clean and pure.  All of us want to work and to prosper so  that we can provide the best possible life for  ourselves and for our children. That is pretty  basic isn't it? The ditficult part is trying to  achieve both of those objectives-cleaner air  and a better standard of living-at the same  time.  The simple  fact  is clean air  isn't free.  Maybe it ought to be, but it isn't. Somebody  has to pay for it. And because of the nature  of our economic system, because every per son ls dependent on some other person for  a product or a service, when somebody pays,  then sooner or later everybody pays. When  it costs  industry more to make a. product,  it costs you more to buy that product.  At U.S. Steel, we r.ecognlze the economic  idiocy of being mandated by overly strict  environmental standards to install controls  to achieve cosmetic  improvement-a waste  which can only further deb111tate our efforts  to invest our capital in steel-producing, job producing plant and equipment. We must  make our steel mills in Allegheny County  more modern and more competitive, and I'm  determined  to do everything  . can to see  that our people and their neighbors in our  steel communities don't Wind up paying for  clean air with their jobs. And I'm determined  to see that what happened in the Mahoning  Valley never happens to the Mon Valley.  our environmental control people have  been working long and hard for many years  with one goal  in mind:  to see  that we you and I-get a hundred cents worth of  cleaner a.tr  for every dollar we spend on  pollution control. Today I'd like  to share  With you some of the results of that effort as  they concern Allegheny County.  our steel industry today is an industry in  crisis. I don't need to remind most of you  that my company recently reported losses of  over $500 million and that a shutdown of  plants which employed some 11,000 people  was recently announced. A number of our  steel facilities have grown too old for eco nomic stability. For example, our Homestead  I  ",1980
211,House,96,-0.355,886,6,Mr. RATCHFORD.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to express my deep concern with a recent  recommendation by the President's Com mission on Social Security to subject half  of a person's cash benefits  to Federal  taxation. In my mind, this would repre sent a grave injustice, and a dangerous  precedent, to those 23.3 million retired  American workers over the age of 65,  who have supported the social security  program over the years, and could not  hope  to bear  this additional financial  burden.  I have heard from numerous elderly  constituents  living on  limited or fixed  incomes who already -face great difficul ties in making ends meet. This proposal,  Mr. Speaker, would amount  to double  taxation for the estimated 10.6 million  beneficiaries to be affected. The average  additional  tax of $350  proposed hits  hardest those already the most vulner able to the cruel forces of inflation, par ticularly in the areas of medical care,  food, and housing.  American working men and women  have entered into what must be consid ered an  inviolable  compact with  the  Federal Government. When they contrib ute to the social security system through  payroll deductions during their working  years, they have every reason to expect  that benefits to which they are ent;tled,  and which many rely on exclusively, will  be available to them. To subject part of  these  benefits  to  further  taxation  amounts to a cruel hoax on recipients,  and must be prevented. I would urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 6012,  intro duced by Representative ALeosTA, which  would . make  a  necessary  technical  amendment to the social security laws  to expressly prohibit the imposition of  such a tax. Thank you.  UNDER CARTER ADMINISTRATION  NOTHING  IS  CERTAIN  BUT  DEATH AND HIGHER TAXES  <Mr. RHODES asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and  to  revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1980
212,House,96,0.225,886,6,Mr. RHODES.," Mr. Speaker, today is  the day when thousands of Americans  are more aware than on any other day  of the year of just how much they pay  in taxes. Nearly 200 years ago, Benjamin  Franklin wrote that-in this world, noth ing is certain but death and taxes. After  25 years of Congress being controlled by  the Democrats,  I  think Mr. Franklin  would agree that his statement should  be amended to read: ""Nothing is certain  but death and higher taxes.''.  During the first 3 years of the Carter  administration, the Democrats who run  Congress have increased taxes by $76 bil lion-an average of $1,000 per taxpaying  household.  In 1980, taxes will increase by another  $66 billion-and in 1981, the tax bite will  worsen by a staggering $96 billion-unless  the American people finally stand up and  say enough.  Today truly is Democrat Tax Increase  Observance Day. But on Tuesday, No vember 4, the American voters can cele brate Republican Tax Cut Day by elect ing a Republican Congress.  A  PROTEST AGAINST  IRRESPON SIBLE FEDERAL SPENDING AND  TAXATION  <Mr. RUDD asked and was given per mission to address the House for 1 minute  and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",1980
213,House,96,0.422,886,6,Mr. RUDD.," Mr. Speaker, today is the  deadline for American taxpayers to file  their 1979 Federal tax returns.  On behalf of my Arizona constituents,  I take this time to register a strong pro test over the fact that the personal tax  burden of average households throughout  our country has increased 20 to 34 per cent just since the Carter administration  took office.  This means  that families whose  in comes have kept pace with infiation each  year have still suffered an annual loss  of 4 to 6 percent in real aftertax earnings  because of Carter administration  tax  increases.  Federal taxation last year was $182.1  billion more than 1976, the last year of  the Ford administration-a total tax in crease of 64 percent in just 3 years.  Federal  income and  social  security  taxes for the median income American  family are now $3,219-compared to $714  25 years ago.  The gigantic Federal tax increase that  our people continue to suffer is the direct  result of Federal overspending-partic ularly by taxing the earnings of Amer ican working people and their businesses  in  order  to  redistribute  that money  through Federal social welfare programs.  Today, Federal tax deadline day, let it  be noted that the American people de mand a halt to the profligate overspend ing policies of Congress, which are re sponsible for the heavY burden of Federal  taxes which saps  the strength of our  American economy and destroys the in centive of our people  to work and  to  produce.  0  1220  INCREASING  UNEMPLOYMENT  IS  NO WAY TO FIGHT INFLATION  <Mr. LOWRY asked and was given  permission to address  the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1980
214,House,96,-0.401,886,6,Mr. LOWRY.," Mr. Speaker, the people  of  the State of Washington  do not  think much of the policies of fighting  inflation by  increasing unemployment.  We need this year in this Congress to ad dress  the need  for capital  formation.  We need to have capital for housing.  We have 3 million people unemployed  in housing in this country, and we are  going to lose 1 milion  jobs if we con tinue not to address the need for capital.  We need capital for business. That  means that we have to look courageously  at the budget this year as it applies to  the future.  Mr. Speaker, !et us not be shortsight ed. Let us not be pennywise and pound  foolish. Let us use good domestic policies  in the budget this year for capital for mation.  HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE COUP IN  LIBERIA  <Mr. BONKER asked and was given  permission  to address the House for 1  minute and  to  revise and extend his  remarks.)  Mr. BONKER, Mr. Speaker, the COUP  which occurred  in Monrovia, Liberia,  over  this past weekend  is part of a  phenomenon which has pervaded many  other parts of Africa in recent years.  Low-ranking military elements seize con trol by killing some of the top leader ship, councils of ""national redemption""  are established to root out ""corrupt"" ele ments, and, unfortunately, all too often  countries sink further into poverty and  economic stagnation.  I fervently hope that this tragic pat tern will not be repeated in Liberia. The  old order was on its way out; the rice  riots of last year gave some indication of  the discontent felt by the populace. Yet  news accountl'l of the conduct of M. Sgt.  Samuel Doe's new regime are very dis tressing. The killing which has occurred,  and which may continue if the ""treason  trials"" are allowed to take place, is rep rehensible and should be vigorously con demned. The cycle of violence must be  stopped. The abuse of those now held  captive by subjecting them to public ridi cule should be ordered to a halt immedi ately.  The United States is in a unique posi tion to encourage Mr. Doe's regime to re spect human rights and refrain from em barking on a wave of bloody recrimina tion or promoting a spirity of revenge.  Historically the bonds of friendship be tween the United States and Liberia have  been very strong, and hopefully can re main so in the future. But I urge that  our Government condemn any further  recriminations which may  occur  in  Liberia. This is a time of great opportu nity as well as danger for the Liberian  people. I hope that the new regime will  now tum its sights to the future and  f0cus on the most important task of re ducing the poverty which afflicts most  Liberian families. We stand ready to help  ",1980

217,House,96,0.155,899,6,Mr. EMERY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  can  only add to the gentleman's argument  that of course the States in which State  academies  are  located have over  the  years made  significant  contributions,  very significant contributions, in terms  of buildings and equipment, in terms, in  some cases, of money for training.  Mr. Chairman, the States have made  a very significant contribution so I do  not think we ought to assume that some how or other  the State academies  in  name only which are funded entirely by  Federal revenues,  that certainly is not  true.  Mr. Chairman, one other point I would  mention is that we would be very, very  0  foolhardy indeed if we allowed these sev eral State academy vessels to go down  the drain because as everyone here in  this Chamber knows the cost of replac ing  those vessels, whether  it  is  from  scrapeheap Navy vessels that would need  extensive renovation  in  terms of hun dreds of millions of dollars possibly, or  the construction of new vessels totaling  maybe the same, is far and beyond, far  out of reach of our meager budgetary re sources and would certainly not meet  with much favor at this point in time  when we are talking about trying to save  money. It is certainly cost7effective for  us to put this paltry amount of money  into this program which will allow these  ships  to operate  in some cases for 10  years more. That  is  certainly  cost eff ective.  Mr. AuCOIN. I  think the gentleman  makes an excellent point, Mr. Chair man. It is in the total scheme of things  a small investment that will buy a great  deal of good, and it is very, very wise  from a  long-range investment point of  view. If we allow these training vessels  to go down the drain, if we cripple the  State academies, then it is going to put  incredible pressure on the Federal Gov ernment to provide some kind of alterna tive; and to give my colleagues an idea  of what the costs might be in terms of  costs and benefits  if  that is an area  which  is  to be followed,  I would note  that  the administration  requests  this  year in this bill for about $6.7 million  for  the State academies was  for some  academies that graduated 600 graduates  annually. That turns out to $11,000 per  graduate, approximately. For the Fed eral Merchant Marine Academy, which  graduates 250 students annually, the ad ministration's original request was about  $18 mUlion, or about $73,000 annually.  Mr. Chairman,  to come back to the  question that the gentleman from Cali fornia posed, it really does come down  to a question of academic excellence and  training excellence  for  the  totality of  our students who are trying to get into  the U.S. merchant fleet as qualified om cers. What this budget request, what this  amendment would do would be to knock  out a provision that simply defers tem porarily one-half-not all but one-half of this year's original request for a mod ernization program.  Mr. Chairman, what does that trans late into, that $1.6 million? It translates  into the deferral of a maintenance shop  at Kings Point, and what do we buy in stead? What do we buy with those funds?  We buy the upgrading, through mainte nance and repair, of the training ves sels of the State academies which are  at the heart of the training of over one half of the students who actually go into  the maritime  business,  the maritime  fleet,  as  licensed omcers every  single  year.

It will not work for  the  long  haul because as unemployment increases  and profits diminish,  tax receipts will  shrink and Federal expenses connected  with unemployment will increase.  We will also have an even more serious  shortage of housing for American fam ilies. Does anyone think that this situa tion will result in cheaper home prices?  The proposal I am introducing today  is a sense of the House of Representa tives resolution calling on the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve Board  to act immediately to begin rolling back  interest rates. There are other devices  that can be used by the Federal Reserve  to fight inflation-selective credit con trols  and money  supply  restrictions.  Soaring interest rates are the wrong re sponse.

241,House,96,-0.192,1211,6,Mr. RUSSO.," Mr. Speaker, I have asked  for permiss:on to speak today so that I  might make the Members of this body  aware of  the outrageous activities of  some of our conferees on the FTC au thorization bill. Some of our conferees  have met in secret time and time again  with Members of the Senate. Much of  what has gone on has appeared in the  press. In fact, today an editorial in the  New York Times informs us that several  differences have been  resolved. May  I  quote one sentence:  The conferees har;e weakened or eliminated  attemots  to prohibit  investigation of  the  funeral  business,  agricultural  cooperatives  and the life insurance industry.  U'nder the House  rules,  I was ap pointed a conferee to protect and debate  my amendment or.. the FTC funeral in dustry investigation. No one had invited  me to any of these secret meetings. No  one has spoken to me about a funeral  compromise. The compromise that has  been discussed in the newspapers is not  even needed because' my amendment does  not prohibit it in the first place.  What  is going on?  If  the Members  of  this body wanted  just  two of our  membership to speak for everybody, we  would  have  just appointed  two con ferees.  I want  the secret meetings  to  end. If someone wants  to discuss  the  funeral amendment, I am available. All  they need to do is call me.  Why  are  certain Members  of  the  House demanding that the Senate re cede on their amendments and saying  we will give up ours in turn? Who are  they, to give up anything? If the Senators have no problems with our amend ments, then where is the impasse?  I  ask  the Speaker  to  contact  the  chairman of the House conferees to con vene a meeting of the House conferees to  discuss all the issues I raised.  :lS  ""ALL D 1530  CITY OF PHOENIX NAMED  AMERICA CITY""  <Mr. RHODES asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and  to  revise and extend his  remarks.)

244,House,96,0.134,1224,6,Mrs. FENWICK.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank my colleague  for yielding  this  time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to speak  very much in the vein of our colleague,  the gentleman from Vermont <Mr. JEF FORDS) . I speak for  those of us in the  East who have seen the ultimate destruc.:..  tion of almost_ every single one of our  great natural resources through ignor ance and through the pressure of popu lation.  Many people in my distt'ict are con cerned about our wilderness areas in the  West. They go there to recapture a great  refreshment of the spirit.  I know it is not easy for those of us  from the East to speak like this. It is not  our land that we are hoping to see desig nated as wilderness;  it is yours. It is  yours,  those of you who are fro.qi  the  West, and perhaps it is u:>.becoming for  me to speak in this way.  But we are all citizens of this Nation,  and we are not saying this land will be  set aside forever. Sometimes I feel that  those who seek to stop wilderness areas  feel that we are taking that land away  and putting it on another planet.  This does not mean that 1t will not  eventually perhaps have to be used. It  just means not now, not yet, and not  until it has to be used.  There is a prudence here. There is cau tion, and a conservative approach to the  use of the resources of our Nation. We  cannot live forever in boxes one on top  of the other. There has to be some place  where we can go and see what God really  intended for this world.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will state  that  the gentleman  from Ohio  <Mr.  SEIBERLING) has 1 minute remaining.  ",1980
245,House,96,0.612,1237,6,Mr. ASHBROOK.," Mr. Chajrman, I rise  in support of the substitute offered by the  gentleman from Idaho, ",1980
246,House,96,0.687,1237,6,Mr. SYMMS.," One  issue this substitute addresses that goes  beyond the confines of this wilderness  bill is the vitally important subject of our  strategic resources poJicy. At present thil3  Nation has no clear policy  to govern  future availability of strategic resources.  To delay the formulation of such a policy  could be a fatal mistake for the well being of the United States.  Mr. HANSEN,  The Symms substitute assures  that  one of  this Nation's most  important  minerals, cobalt, will be able to be de veloped to assure a domestic supply. The  committee's bill does provide for a 5-year  period of mineral extraction of this vital  element, but it does not go far enough in  assuring  long-term future availability.  This House has an opportunity today to  make a firm policy declaration on cobalt  that could build toward a sound policy  on other strategic materials by voting for  this substitute.  We have seen graphic evidence in re cent years of how dependence on foreign  supplies of oil and gas can have devastat ing impacts on the American economy.  This House should not allow our Nation  to find itself in similar situations with  other resources. We could conceivably  live without foreign oil, although at a  crippling cost. We cannot live without  cobalt. Without cobalt critical parts for  the jet engines and missi.le gutdance sys tems that provide the needed protection  of this Nation could not be pro~uced.  Integral parts for navigation and gyro<3  systems  for  stabilizing  airplanes  and  ships could not be built or replaced. This  could lead to major cutbacks in our com mercial  transportation of  goods  and  people.  Presently, Amerlca has only one pos sible domestic  source  for cobalt-the  Blackbird area encompassed in this bill.  Part of this lies outside of the wilderness  section of this bill, but the major portions  lie within the area. The Noranda Min ing Co. estimates as much as 500 million  pounds of cobalt could  lie within the  designated wilderness.  In 1977 the Idaho Bureau of Mines and  Geology completed a mineral survey that  showed sufficient trends in e').'isting cobalt  veins to warrant leaving the entire de posit area out of the wilderness designa tion.  Could this House  take a chance on  leaving the Blackbird area in wilderness  and depending on foreign supplies? I do  not think so. America's dependence on  foreign sources for much of our strategic  material has grown to alarming levels  in recent years. Of the 35 minerals and  metals considered of strategic  impor tance, the United States depends on im ports in all but one case. In 22 cases this  import dependency exceeds 50 percent.  Currently, 97 percent of our cobalt comes  from foreign sources. The remaining 3  percent is ore recovered from byprod ucts of copper and iron mining and from  recycled scrap. Unless this Nation can  build a domestic source of pure cobalt  this  import  dependency may  grow  further.  How stable is our foreign sources of  cobalt? The  largest proportion of our  cobalt comes from the Kolwezi mines in  Zaire. This amounts to 60 percent of im ports. In 1978 Kolwezi was the scene of  violence as guerrillas invaded the Shaba  province where Kolwezi is situated. The  guerrillas invaded from training sites in  Angola and were closely linked to Cuban  and Soviet efforts to destabilize the re gion. The price of cobalt skyrocketed  from $6.40 per pound preinvasion to as  high as $50 per pound for spot market  transactions as the mines tried to rebuild  from the battle damage.  Another major  source of cobalt  is  Zambia. In February 1980 Zambia con cluded a $100 million arms deal with the  Soviet Union for Mig-21 combat aircraft.  This followed closely the total of $100  million given to the nation by the United  States in general aid. Zambia's close ties  to the Soviets and its role in the Rhode sian guerrilla war cast doubts as to the  future of cobalt supplies.  The third major source for cobalt is  Finland, a nation with a recent history  of being very careful not to off end its  Soviet neighbor. In a major crisis would  the nation that gave the world ""Finland ization"" be able to withstand Soviet pres sure to end or lower cobalt shipments to  America?  The instability of Zaire, Zambia, and  possibly Finland must be viewed in the  broader  context  of what  the Soviet  Union is doing to assure that instability.  The invasion of the Shaba Province was  directed  as mu~h toward  disrupting  cobalt mining as to destabmze the gov ernment of Mobutu. In early 1979 Bel gium stepped in to stop a third invasion  that was being planned for Kolwezi. Only  the presence of European mercenaries  near the Angolan border forestalled the  invasion.  The U.S.S.R. has had as its policy since  World War II to become self-sufficient  in strategic minerals and metals. Of the  35 minerals and metals that are consid ered strategic the U.S.S.R. is self-suffi cient in all categories except 7. In those  seven  categories  foreign  dependency  comes from satellites or neutral nations  and only fluorine needs to be imported  above  the 50-percent level. From this  stable base of resources the Soviets have  begun to deny the West, especially the  United States,  these  same  resources.  Through destabilization, control of re gions or sealanes, and through outright  invasion the U.S.S.R. has moved to stran gle supply. In a press conference yes terday Admiral Moore called  this  the  strategy of denial. It amounts to a re source war that could beat the United  States without the Soviets having to use  any of their nuclear weapons or have any  direct  confrontation with  the United  States.  The resources war is being fought on  many  fronts. Wherever  resources are  available to the United States there are  active efforts to destabilize friendly gov ernments and  to co-opt neutral ones.  Regional hegemony is another approach.  Angola and Mozambique fell to Cubans  and Cuban trained guerrillas setting the  stage for the assault on Rhodesia, the  major noncommunist source of chrome.  Now with Rhodesia neutralized, if not to tally captured by anti-American ele ments, the push is toward South Africa  where other chrome deposits exist as well  as  vital  supplies  of  uranium,  gold,  manganese, platinum, fluorine, or asbes tos, antimony, vanadium, and other ele ments. If South Africa falls, these stra tegic elements as well as critical port  facilities fall to the Soviets. In the Middle  East the Yemen war,  the  invasion of  ",1980
247,House,96,0.342,1263,6,Mr. DERWINSKI.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  join with my colleagues  this afternoon in paying a special tribute  to a great public servant and a world renowned figure  in the athletic arena,  Jesse Owens. The world will long remem ber him as one of the greatest and most  famous athletes in track and field his tory.  He not only captured the hearts of the  world, but Americans will long remem ber Jesse Owens as a hero, whose four  gold medals at the 1936 Olympic games  in Berlin achieved a feat unmatched in  modern times in Olympic track competi tion and disproved the Nazi doctrine of  race superiority.  Jesse was a man who had the ability  to inspire people, the type of individual  who one would have to admire and re spect. The spirit that he demonstrated  during the days that he was America's  Olympic star persisted  throughout the  years.  Jesse Owens displayed courage, deter mination, and an uncompromising pur suit  of  excellence  in  his  personal  endeavors. His dedication and commit ment  to people exemplified his great  sensitivity for all people and their needs,  especially the poor and underprivileged.  His strength of character will continue  to serve as a model for all young people  of today, and as an example of courage  in overcoming obstacles thought by most,  to be almost unsurmountable. Jesse was  a  tireless fighter for the causes he be lieved in. His life was symbolized by a  pursuit of excellence.  Jesse Owens was  a  champion ath lete,  nobly  representing  the United  States. However, although Jesse Owens  did surprisingly well, we ~hould not use  him as an issue for opposing our present  position in boycotting the Olympic games  in Moscow. The Soviets are taking elab orate steps to propagandize the Moscow  games. And just like Hitler in 1936, they  are developing their own athletes to win  medals and score maximum propaganda  impact. The fact is that in this age of  mass  communications,  propaganda  is  involved  in many of  the actions  that  governments take. Therefore, if we take  away the Soviet's propaganda card, we  have done a great damage to them.  As an Olympic champion, and as a  lifelong champion of the rights of the  underprivilged, Jesse Owens earned the  respect of citizens throughout this coun try and the world. I can think of no  finer legacy than his outstanding record  of service and achievement.  I extend my sincerest sympathy to his  family.   e ",1980
248,House,96,-0.232,1263,6,Mr. CAVANAUGH.," Mr. Speaker, the  life of Jesse Owens brought  into dra matic focus the best and the worst facets  of his country. As a participant in the  1936 Olympic games in Berlin, he acted  as the catalyst for a surge in national  pride and a repudiation of racism as em bodied in Hitler's theory of Aryan su premacy. His  supreb performances  in  track and field events earned him four  gold medals, a feat which still has yet to  be equalled.  How ironic, then, that upon his return  to America, Jesse Owens found that as  far as bigotry in his own country was  concerned, nothing had changed. The  domestic significance of his accomplish ments  in Berlin was  ignored;  instead,  parasitic entrepreneurs sought to mock  the prowess that had brought glory to  him and to America by submitting him  to races against animals, and other sorts  of indignities. Mr. Owens acquiesced be cause he needed the money to support his  family, but one can imagine the frustra tion and anger he must have felt about  being a black ""hero"" in white America.  Against this background of discrimina tion and hypocrisy,  it is all  the more  remarkable that Mr. Owens resisted bit terness and  fought  a  system stacked  against him until he had  transcended  its prohibitions to become a successful  businessman  and  an  admired  public  figure. This personal triumph is, in my  mind, every bit as inspiring as his Olym pic victories.  In Nebraska's Second District, which  I  represent, Mr. Owens was  the com mencement speaker at Boys Town's high  school  graduation  ceremony  in  1971,  served on that institution's board of di rectors for 3 years from 1974 to 1977, and  remained a member of the Friends of  Boys Town until his death. Such com mitments to the less privileged youth of  our country reflected his concern that  they be spared  the  injustices he had  known.  There is no doubt, of course, that Jesse  Owens was a truly gifted athlete, perhaps  one of the greatest of this century; rec ollections of this powerful yet fluid stride  infuse the cliche ""poetry in motion"" with  true meaning. But it is his inner strength  that I will remember-a strength based  on his faith in himself and in the coun try he loved. And I would like to believe  that ultimately, America vindicated the  faith of Jesse Owens.    ",1980
249,House,96,-0.175,1263,6,Mr. FLIPPO.," Mr. Speaker, Jesse Ow ens is a hero in the truest sense of that  word. His Olympic victories earned him  a rightful place among champions, but  more important was the character of this  man. The strength of Jesse Owens was  his dignity. His life provided a testament  to his own words:  Regardless of his color, a man who be comes a  recognized athlete has to learn to  walk 10 feet tall. But he must have his dig nity off the athletic field.  There were people  and  times  that  would have denied Jesse Owens his dig nity. He reacted not with bitterness, but  with the fortitude to prevail over adver sity. His name will live on not only in  record books, but in history books as  well. He touched many lives in his in dividual quest for excellence.  The accomplishments of Jesse Owens  are  extraordinary  for  a man of any  time. He has made all of us proud to be  Americans.  Our memory is clear of this American  Olympian with his four gold medals in  Berlin. When the Star-Spangled Banner  was played, Jesse Owens stood proud and  unbowed under the glare of Adolf Hitler.  Owens had shown the world the error  of Ayran racial superiority and the fool ishness of Nazi racism. The Berlin Olym pics were not political to Jesse Owens.  He let his deeds stand as the most elo quent statement of the games.  The  courage of  Jesse Owens  gave  strength to black Americans. His great ness would not be diminished by the an ger of a Hitler or disappointments at  home.  Jesse Owens as a black American knew  the shackles of racial bigotry and the  chains which replaced slavery with sec ond class citizenship. Even this authen tic hero felt the sting of persecution by  his own countrymen. He had the courage  and fortitude to face squarely a system  of oppression and prevail.  Born Jam es Cleveland Owens on Sep tember 12, 1913, he is a native son of Ala bama born in the Morgan County town  of Danville in the Fifth Congressional  District. As much as I would like to claim  this man for his birthplace alone, he is  too big for any one place and we must  share the glory not only with his homes  in Ohio, Illinois, and Arizona, but with  the rest of the Nation as well. He would  carry with him from that sharecropper's  cabin in Danville a strength which made  him strive to overcome and overcome he  did. Dr. Archibald Carey, a circuit court  judge in Chicago and minister emeritus  of Quinn Chapel of the African Meth odist Episcopal Church, summed it up  this way in his eulogy of Jesse Owens:  He lived in a land in which big people are  big and little people can become big. Jesse  was a prize example of that.  The life of Jesse Owens was filled with  many ups  and downs. He persevered  thromrh the highs and lows and always  was able to give something of himself.  His most obvious shortcoming was that  he was generous  to a  fault. His work  with charity was a  lifelong activity.  Jesse Owens set high standards for  hi.mself and he met them. That does not  mean that he was alwavs  the winner,  but he always did  the best he could.  ",1980

In my opinion, this proc ess has shown the increasing dependency  on outside consulting services and  in  many cases the outright delegation of  policymaking and decisionmaking au thority to private industry at excessive  costs to the American taxpayer. In addi tion we have uncovered blatant exam ples' of circumvention of personnel ceil ings and other civil service  rules and  laws.  According to GAO, the efforts of the  Office of Management and Budget have  not been effective. Little or no improve ment has occurred in agencies' manage ment of consulting services and OMB  has provided little real guidance in es tablishing more rigorous procedures for  approving consulting service contracts.  In my opinion, swift and effective ac tion needs to be taken. I intend to con tinue my  investigation  into  this  issue  and introduce legislation in the near fu ture. Congressional action is necessary  to bring  this problem under control.

255,House,96,-0.074,95,11,Mr. SANTINI.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I, too,  join the select  camp of instantaneous experts who have  enjoyed the opportunity of visiting the  continent of Africa and returning to the  United States of America with total in sight and infallible solutions. As chair man of the Mines and Mining Commit tee, I went there with one particular ob jective or goal in mind, and that was to  examine the research question that the  gentleman from Oregon so well described,  about the critical importance to the free  world of Africa's strategic minerals.  We are in a most vulnerable posture  in terms of mineral resources, and it is  important  to  try  to understand  the  magnitude of this problem, in conjunc tion with  the very critical social, eco nomical, and political problems of  the  continent. It is impossible to offer simple  solutions to all the problems there.  But I think as the body deliberates on  the merits of this amendment, there are  some  important  considerations  that  should be shared with my good friend,  the  gentleman  from New York,  and  others.  I  cannot at  this  juncture be  swept up  in euphoric endorsement of  Mr. Mugabe and his efforts to date but  I would take particular exception to the  observations  of my  good  friend,  the  gentleman from Missouri, that there is  no tangible evidence of change. I think  that  is manifestly  incorrect.  I would  point out that I have endorsed the efforts  of my good friend, the gentleman from  Missouri,  in  the past to put economic  constraints on allowing  those who ap pear to be in adversary postures around  the world  to dip into the cash register  of the  taxpayers of  the United states  of America  in order to subsidize  their  antipathies toward the United States of  America. Given  that history, I believe  it would be self-defeating for our Na tion to ignore some of the encouraging  tangible evidences of positive change in  Zimbabwe. My  negative  expectations  were misplaced. Positive  events  have  transpired that I would never have pre dicted and I doubt that the gentleman  from Missouri would  have  predicted  them either. Mr. Mugabe campaigned  on expropriation of both  the private  agricultural lands and the private indus trial properties of Zimbabwe, then Rho desia. No private land has been expro priated for either agricultural purposes  or industrial purposes.  During my Rhodesian visit I met and  spoke with those engaged in the minerals  industry. Some were most skeptical and  apprehensive about the prospects of Mr.  Mugabe's government and predicted that  within a month after his election  the  expropriation  efforts would  be  com menced. They were wrong.  I spoke last month with the former  Minister of Mines who now is serving  tn a subordinate capacity in the Ministry on Mines. He has worked in the civil  service of that government for many,  many years. During  the January visit  he predicted ominous consequences  if  a Mugabe government should come  to  pass. Last month he informed me that  most of his dire expectations had been  at least unfounded to date. He observed  that much of what Mr. Mugabe has done  has startled and amazed him in terms of  the tempered, practical, political nature  of his actions and efforts.  I  doubt  that  the  conduct  of Mr.  Mugabe reflects a conversion to democ racy. I  think it, rather, reflects a very  profound  political  analysis  by Mr.  Mugabe  that  he  needs  the  internal  strength of the existing civil service and  the existing private business  founda tion in order to build the society that he  envisions will respond to the very criti cal social and economic concerns enun ciated  by  the  gentleman  from New  York. I think he is just a plain good old  practical, pragmatic politician, as op posed to a philosophical dictator.  I do  think that the conduct to date  does  represent some encouraging evi dence  that  this  important African  nation might make it work. Is there evi dence  to  conclude  the  problems  are  solved? No.  I do not think any of us  today can put the imprimatur of ab solute credibility on the present actions  of Mr. Mugabe, because his political  polemic before the election was very dis tressing. His actions after the election  have been very encouraging.  I would  like  to recognize that encouragement.  The representatives of South Africa  with whom we met this week have put  an endorsement on the Mugabe efforts.  It is their belief if the governmental ex periment that is presently underway in  Zimbabwe proves positive, conceivably  an  adaptation  of  that political  and  philosophical experiment could work in  South Africa. I hope so. The free world  needs  the  friendship and  the critical  materials of these two important African  nations.  The CHAffiMAN.

256,House,96,-0.494,108,11,Mr. YATES.," Mr. Chairman, this has  been a most interesting and stimulating  debate. It is an important subject, so rec ognized  in  the House  by  the many  speakers who participated in it. I want  to make one point, that I believe should  be made-because of the questions raised  here of  the Israeli settlements on  the  West Bank-and because of possible ref erences which might  be wrongfully  drawn  from  some of  the  statements.  That point is of Israel's good faith in the  peacemaking process.  It must be made clear at once that  peace does not reign in the Middle East.  Israel, in spite of its peace negotiations  with Egypt, is still a beleaguered coun try. Arab nations, other than Egypt, are  still its enemies and blatantly so. The  PLO sends its emissaries across Israel's  borders to kill and maim Israel's civil ians. Israel is still a country under siege.  Jordan and Syria are still her declared  enemies. Thus, the West Bank and the  Golan Heights are a no-man's land, a  buffer zone, providing an area to protect  against military attacks upon Israel like  those made on previous occasions by  Jordan and Syria.  We hailed the Camp David agreements  rightfully as a first step toward peace.  Israel  demonstrated  by  signing  that  agreement and subsequently, by her strict  adherence to its terms, her good faith  and her willingness to take risks in the  cause of peace.  By military action Israel had gained  the entire Sinai desert. In support of the  Camp David accords, Israel gave up the  strategic Jiddi and Mitla passes. She  gave up the Abu Rudeis oil wells which  had supplied her oil needs and without  which now, her purchases of oil are con tributing to her spiraling inflation. Sh.e  gave up two military airfields in the Sinai  which were among the best in the world.  She gave up three-fifths of the land mass  itself and is pledged to give up the re mainder at a later date.  Ambassadors between the two coun tries have been exchanged. Trade is be ginning to :flourish. The peace. process is  working.  All the Arab nations and Israel have  approved Security Council Resolution  No. 242 which provides for a surrender  by Israel ""of territories"" taken during  the war, not all  the  territories as the  Arab  nations  insist,  but  ""territories""  surrendered with assurances of Israel's  security requirements. The PLO, how ever, demands not only the West Bank  territory entirely,  including Jerusalem,  but all of Israel itself. Even though Pal estinians may say ""we follow  the PLO  leadership,"" ts Israel wrong when it re fuses to negotiate with an organization  dedicated by its own charter to Israel's  destruction? I say no.    Israel  is willing  to  negotiate with  Jordan, which is essentially a Palestin ian state. King Hussein has been invited  to participate in the Camp David negoti ations but has refused  to do so. Why  should he not negotiate on behalf of the  Palestinians?  When I was in Israel I heard Israelis  and Palestinians both look to a peaceful  settlement through an economic federa tion between Israel, Jordan, and a Pal estinian West Bank entity-not a state,  but an entity containing certain defined  autonomy, defined by agreement between  the parties. Gaza would be included with  the West Bank in such an entity to con tribute to its viability through an appro priate road connection.  That  is one plan, others are under  consideration. It becomes clear that King  Hussein is an important party to the ne gotiations. Unfortunately, he refuses to  participate, but every  effort must be  made to persuade him to join the quest  for peace.  Mr. Chairman, when President Sadat  made his dramatic visit  to  Israel, he  found Israel to J:>e very generous in the  peace negotiations. A comparable effort  by King Hussein might bring comparable  results.  The CHAIRMAN pro  tempore  <Mr.  PANETTA). The  time of  the gentleman  from New York <Mr. RosENTHAL)  has  expired.  ",1980

Unfortunately,  these people who have created  the  propaganda against the oil companies  have not checked their figures. The  facts show that in these inflationary  times the price of a barrel of oil has  not risen very much in a fair compari son.  It is particularly interesting to com pare the cost of a 30-second TV com mercial to the cost of a barrel of oil in  the United States. The price of an  average prime time 30-second commer cial on network television has gone up  by 66.1 percent from 1975  to 1979.  This  increase  in current dollars.  This is also only an average commer cial. For advertising that is  in great  demand the increases in cost are even  more. For example, a 30-second com mercial in the world series cost $52,200  in 1975, and by 1979 it cost $100,000.  is  ",1980
261,,96,0.353,199,11,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker,  the  Spirit of Helsinki 1980 is a continuing  vigil  to remind the Soviet Union of  their  commitment  to  the Helsinki  agreement.  The repressive emigration policy of  the Government of the U.S.S.R. is de signed  to crush  the  inner spirit of  Soviet Jewish citizens. But,  I  think  that the Government has failed. The  people know that upon application for  emigration they may face harassment,  loss of jobs, and years of waiting. But,  this has not deterred their desire to  emigrate,  nor  their willingness  to  make applications.  That, to me, is a sign of hope. What ever the obstacle, the Soviet citizens  continue their struggle for  freedom.  Their spirit is not suppressed.  I would like to invite the Members'  attention  to  the Lederman  family,  who have not given up their dream of  emigration from Russia. Grigory and  Elizabeta Lederman and their 6-year old daughter, Irma, live in Moscow. I  have little information on the Leder man family, but their story is a famil iar one. Grigory is an electronics engi neer, and his wife  instructs piano in  their  home. Grigory's parents  and  brother live  in Israel. In April 1976,  the Lederman family applied to emi grate  to  Israel, but they have been  denied this right.  I believe  that all of us,  including  myself, have  two  responsibilities  to  the Lederman family, and to the many  others who have been  forcibly  de tained in the U.S.S.R. First, we must  continue to remind the Soviet Govern ment of its commitment to the Helsin ki agreement, which included a pledge  to reunite divided families. The Soviet  Union may be able  to provide  the  numbers of their citizens allowed to  leave the country, but we can counter  with the years of harassment prior to  departure and the many others who  are still waiting.  And second, the spirit of the Jewish  citizens is vital. We must continue to  support them in their efforts to leave  the Soviet Union. They are the ones  that must apply for emigration, and  then suffer for it. Our role requires no  sacrifice. All we have to do is to call  the attention of the Soviet Govern ment to individual cases of suffering  and denial. The letters from Members  of Congress, friends, and relatives give  the people additional strength to con tinue their struggle.  If we forget the Jewish families and  do not provide  the support they so  need,  then  they are alone, and we  have failed. I invite every Member of  Congress to join in the Spirit of Helsinki, 1980 vigil for the people of the  Soviet Union.e  13571  TORNADO DAMAGE  DEVASTATING  HON.

It result ed in about 25 million dollars' worth of  property damage, yet, due to an out standing civil defense warning system,  no lives were lost. It should also be  pointed out that another tornado rav aged Sedalia, Mo., on May 4, 1977, and  again no deaths occurred because of  an effective warning system. Some $20  million in damage resulted from the  1977 tornado.  The national average warning time  for a  tornado  is 4 minutes;  in  two  cases,  civil  defense  in Sedalia  and  Pettis County have more than a 20minute warning.  I  consider  this an  outstanding record.  Mr. Speaker, for a community to be  struck by two destructive tornadoes in  just over 3 years without one single  life lost is a distinction worthy of note.  Several people from Sedalia and Pettis  County, Mo., deserve special attention  for  the alertness and work  they of fered in protecting their community.  The names of those who were helpful  in the 1977 tornado are indicated by  an asterisk.  EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTER  James Snavely-Director.  Judeth Smith-Secretary.

267,House,96,0.398,290,11,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr.  Speaker,  thank the gentleman for yielding.  I think the gentlewoman from Colorado  has accurately described  the situation  here. When Public Law 92-297 was orig inally enacted setting up certain retire ment benefits for air traffic controllers,  it was limited only to Federal Aviation  Administration controllers and it left out  those air traffic controllers who work for  the Department of Defense.  Mr. Speaker, there is no distinction in  training, duties, requirements, and per formance of services between Depart ment of Transportation air traffic con trollers. The stress is just as much, the  degree of skill is just as much. However,  there were some 230 air traffic control lers not included. This is simply an et!ort  on my part, representing the air tr~ffic  I  controllers of the Department of Defense,  to correct an inequity. I thank the com mittee for its consideration and the sup port of H.R. 1781. The measure is sup ported by  the Department of Defense,  the Office of Management and Budget,  and the Administration. There was no  testimony against the measure in com mittee. I have been working on this for a  number of years. I am very glad to see it  come to this point of fruition. I want to  thank those who have added support to  it.  I yield back the balance of my time,  Mr. Speaker.  ",1980

269,,96,-0.324,407,11,Mr. HARRIS.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to direct the attention of my col leagues to a new GAO report which I  released  yesterday  with  Senator  PRYOR on the improper use of consult ants by Federal agencies. According  to GAO, agencies have failed to make  satisfactory progress in their manage ment of consulting services during the  past 20 years. Despite-the fact that  GAO has issued 30 audit reports iden tifying  problems  in  every major  agency, improvements still need to be  made in:  Identifying expenditures for consult ing services,  Obtaining  adequate  competition  when awarding consulting service con tracts,  Justifying  services,  Assuring that consultant studies are  not duplicated, and  Implementing effective management  controls to assure the proper use of  these services.  I agree with GAO's conclusion that  OMB's efforts  to  improve  agencies  management  of  consulting  services  have not been effective. OMB's at tempts  to  identify  the  amount  of  money spent by agencies for consult ing services have resulted in understat ed figures. OMB guidance to establish  controls to improve the management  of consulting services has resulted in  little  improvement. Perennial  prob lems concerning conflict of  interest  continue to surface.  I feel that the time has come for leg islative action to  identify consultant  costs and the potential for conflicts of  interests to the sunshine.  I am cur13779  rently drafting legislation to achieve  these goals.  I  feel  that exposure of  this information is essential for  this  Congress to carry out its oversight re sponsibility and  to guarantee public  awareness.  lVIy  legislation will not hinder the  procurement process  in any way.  will merely allow sunshine  into  the  labyrinth  of  the  Federal Govern ment's consulting activity.e  It  RISK ASSESSMENT BILL  HON. JOHN W. WYDLER  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 9, 1980   ",1980
270,,96,0.277,407,11,Mr. WYDLER.," Mr. Speaker,  the  issue of risks connected with techno logical  advancement, particularly  in  energy  technology, has begun  to re ceive well-deserved attention in recent  months. Our Science and Technology  Committee has  been pursuing  this  theme as a basis for assessing technol ogies over the past 2% years. Most re cently, a member of  the committee  pr.oposed a risk assessment bill to en courage  the Federal agencies  to ad dress this question in a more compre hensive manner. The related question  which I  feel deserves additional con sideration is that o.f the gap between  real and perceived risk of technology  development.  For instance, it is clear that a major  responsibility  for  that gap between  the real comparatively small risk of ra diation from nuclear power generation  and the perceived risk on the part of  the people must, in large part, lie with  this administration. The White House  has simply not chosen to educate the  people  in any balanced way on the  comparative risks of energy  technol ogies and has allowed its own visceral  discomfort with  respect  to nuclear  power to dominate its position rather  than performing critical assessments.  The following is an interesting article  which  appeared  in  the New York  Times on May 22, on this topic, ""Tech nology:  Scientific  Gains  and  the  Risks,"" by Peter J. Schuyten and I rec ommend it to my colleagues.  TECHNOLOGY: SCIENTIFIC GAINS AND THE  RISKS  Has the rapid proliferation of technology  and the risks associated with technological  advancement created a new wariness on the  part of the public?  And what of the public's belief in experts?  Have the disturbing events at Three Mile  Island, the fractured engine mounts of the  DC-lO's, or  the unfolding story of Love  Canal eroded the public's confidence in the  pronouncements of the scientific and engi neering communities?  In an attempt to assess the present mood,  an independent opinion survey found that a  majority of Americans feel they face more  risk now than they did 20 years ago, and  further, that the risks of living in a techno logical society will increase.  But  despite  the  heightened  sense  of  danger, the findings indicate that the public  ",1980

272,House,96,-0.49,433,11,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker, according to  Webster's Dictionary a ""kangaroo court""  is a mock trial in which the principles of  law and justice are disregarded or per verted. I believe that if mock trials exist  they should be the exclusive prerogative  of dictatorial governments bent on con victing the innocent when evidence does  not justify a verdict of guilty. I also be lieve that truth should prevail over cus tom and  tradition. Unfortunately  the  custom of this body has been to ignore  certain inherent deficiencies in the proc ess of justice. Unfortunately the tradi tion has been for Members to be polite  even while being unjust and to be grate ful while being unfair. Today  I hope  that both custom and tradition will be  discarded in favor of truth and fairness.  Today I hope th:s House does not en gage in a charade projecting the illusion  of an orderly, fair process while at the  same  time denying one of our Mem ber's his  individual and constitutional  rights during the proceedings.  Mr. Speaker, without feeling a neces sity for restraint or for mincing words,  I categorically charge that the proceed ings of the Committee on Standards of  Official Conduct ttccurately fit the defi nition of Webster's ""Kangaroo Court.""  I am not a member of that committee,  but I did attend the hearings involving  CHARLES H. WILSON. In fact, I attended  more sessions than most members of the  committee. To be perfectly candid, the  chaarman and one other member of the  committee are the only two who spent as  much time as I hearing the evidence. So  ",1980
273,House,96,0.326,446,11,Mr. LIVINGSTON.," Mr. Speaker, the  charges against Mr. WILSON are con tained in the original cOIIIlmittee report,  in the RECORD of May 29, 1980, and in  the amended report.  There is no need to dwell on the facts.  The record is complete.  Mr. WILSON is charged first with vio lating House rule 43, clause 4,  in three  counts,  to wit:  receiving gifts of sub stantial value from a person with direct  interest in legislation.  The committee found sumcient evi dence to prove clearly and convincingly  that Mr. WILSON received three checks  totaling $10,500  from Lee Rogers, and  that Lee Rogers, whose principal busi ness was a mail order operation, had a  direct interest in postal legislation, over  which Mr. WILSON,  as a member of  the Postal Subcommittee, had direct  jurisdiction.  The question  is whether  the checks  constituted  ""loans""  or  ""gifts.""  The  definitions of both were inserted by me  into the RECORD of May 29, 1980.  The committee found that, although  two checks were marked ""loans,"" and  Lee Rogers called them ""loans,"" there  wasNo written agreement;  No maturity date;  No interest:  No repayment schedule;  No attempt to repay; and  No demand to repay.  In fact, it was deemed totally unrea sonable to believe them to be anything  other  than ""gifts.""  Hence, the committee found Mr. WIL soN guilty of counts 1, 2, and 3. In counts  7,  8,  9, 10, and 11, Mr. WILSON was  charged with five instances of syphoning  off campaign funds for his personal use,  in violation of House rule 43, clause 6.  In fact, the committee found Mr. WIL soN violated rule 43, clause 6 by convert $25,383.35 of campaign funds to his per sonal use.  The checks show the transactions. The  only question is this: Were they reim bursements for prior loans to his cam paign?  Mr. WILSON did not  testify, but he  leaves the House with the clear implica tion tha.t he is claiming they were reim bursement for prior loans.  Lacking any evidence to prove such is  true, the committee found evidence to  show  clearly  and  convincingly  that  money was taken by Mr. WILsoN strictly  for his personal use,  and  that  these  funds were not campaign debts to him.  There is no evidence at all to show they  were campaign obligations to Mr. WIL soN.  Moreover, documents  introduced by  Representative BILL THOMAS, show cate gorically, by Mr. WILSON's own hand,  that  in  the only campaign preceding  these  transactions,  the candidate, Mr.  WILSON,  contributed no money  the  campaign. He loaned no money to the  campaign, and the campaign was com pleted  in  the black, without debt. So  there was no need for Mr. WILSON to loan  the campaign money.  Now we hear that Mr. WILSON raised  $15,727 in a fundraiser in February 1971  and $13,880 in November 1971.  Mr. WILSON would now have us be lieve that this money was raised to re imburse himself for out-of-pocket cam paign costs or office expenses not re flected on his campaign documents $25,383.35 to be exact.  This argument sim-ply does not hold  water, and is beyond belief for an av erage reasonable man. There are simply  no documents which verify such out-of pocket expenditures.  The  checks  supporting  counts  7  through 11 make  it abundantly  clear  that Mr. WILSON had personal obliga tions which had nothing to do with his  campaign, and that he took the money  from his campaign to pay them off.  Thus, there is ample justification to  to  ",1980

WILL  RAILROAD  DEREGULATION  INSURE THE SAFETY OF AMERI CA'S RAIL SYSTEM?  ",1980
279,House,96,-0.133,472,11,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Mr. Speaker, as you  know,  for several months now  I have  taken the floor from time to time to dis cuss my concerns about the safety of our  Nation's railroads. Today, I will conclude  my series of statements with a general  discussion of the financial condition of  the rail  industry as  it  relates  to  rail  safety.  There was a time when railroads were  the topic of popular songs. Riding by rail  was a glamorous way to travel. Towns  fought for rail service to assure economic  prosperity. Times have changed and so  has the tune. Airplane, cars, and trucks  became the modes of travel in this coun try for both people and products.  Today, it is widely recognized that the  U.S. railroad industry is facing serious  financial problems. Although some rail roads are financially healthy, a number  of other railroads-such as the Milwau kee Road  and  the Rock  Island-are  bankrupt, and others-such as the Chi cago and North Western, and the illinois  Central Gulf-are financially weak. Con rail, the quasi-public railroad, is continu ing to incur large deficits, and is gen erally expected to need even more Fed eral financial assistance than the $3.3  billion already authorized by Congress.  The Department of Transportation has  concluded that, if present trends con tinue, railroads will  incur a composite  shortfall of between $13 and $16 billion  in needed capital investment within the  next few years.  The decline of our Nation's railroads is  primarily the result of a policy decision  made years ago to encourage and subsi dize other modes of transportation such  as airplanes, cars, and trucks. The rail road companies, seeing what was hap pening, began to divert their investment  capital to everything else from pipelines,  oil, and trucking companies, to publish ing companies, amusement parks, and  real estate. In terms of track mainte nance, that meant company safety in spectors had  to compete with a wide  range of other-and more profitabe- interests when trying to secure funds for  track repairs.  Although the figures vary from rail road to railroad, recent data indicates  an average rate of return on company  investments of only 3.43 percent. In 1978,  the rate of return on equity was only 1.55  percent  for  railroad operations, com pared  to 8.62 percent for barges, and  17.21 percent for trucks. In short, railroads,  due  primarily  to  shortsighted  Government policies, have been severely  handicapped in their ability to compete  with other modes of transportation.  It has been suggested that the solution  to the problem of dramatic increases in  rail accidents is deregulation. By dereg ulating the rail industry, as advocates  of  this argument contend, companies  will have  the capital necessary to op erate safely. While there may be com pelling reasons to deregulate the railroad  industry, we should realize that deregu lation, in itself, will not necessarily solve  the problems related to rail safety. The  result of a study conducted by the Fed eral Railroad Administration sheds some  light on this subject.  The FRA's comparison of profit rates of  the top 30 railroads shows that profits  vary widely from a high of 7.58 percent  profit to a 54 percent loss. The analysis of  railroad profit rates and accident rates  indicated that there was not a strong  relationship between railroad profits and  railroad accident rates. While bankrupt  railroads do have higher accident rates,  some other railroads with relatively high  profits have very poor rail safety records.  For example, the Elgin Joliet and East ern ranks second in profit rates, and 29th  in safety. Yet the Santa Fe ranks 13th  in profit rates, and 3d  in safety. The  FRA report concluded that the relation ship between railroad profit rates and  railroad safety ""cannot be considered  very strong.'' The correlation coefficient  which describes the association between  the two variables equaled minus 0.54.  So that you will be aware of the FRA's  statistics, I am submitting the following  summary chart comparing profit rates  and accident rates;  A COMPARISON OF PROFIT RATES AND ACCIDENT RATES BY RAILROAD COMPANY  Railroad company  Profit rate  (per dollar  of assets  percent)  Acidents  per million  car-miles  1975-77  Profit  ranking  Accident  ranking  Railroad company  Profit rate  (per dollar  of assets  percent)  Acidents  per million  car-miles  1975-77  Profit  ranking  Accident  rankin&  Sante Fe. _______________________ -----Bessemer & Lake Erie __________________  Boston & Maine ________________________  Burlin~ton Northern. ______ --------_____  Chessie System. __ ----------------_____  Milwaukee ____________ ------_-------___  Chicago & North Western ________________  Rock Island ______________ -------------ConraiL _______________________________  Delaware & Hudson _____________________  Denver & Rio Grande ___________________  Detroit Toledo & Ironton ________________  Duluth Missabe & Iron Range ____________  Elgin Joliet & Eastern ___________________  Family Lines Systems ___________________  2. 64  7. 58  -6.67  1. 86  4. 42  -2.44  -.93  -7.02  -10.02  -4.18  4.62  -.07  -1.16  5. 79  3.10  13  1  27  16  4  25  21  28  29  26  3  20  22  2  11  0.136  . 325  .390  .240  .372  .676  . 829  . 951  . 392  . 382  . 093  .532  . 346  1. 741  .482  3  11  16  9  14  24  26  27  17  15  1  22  13  29  20  Florida East Coast. _____________________  Grand Trunk Western ___________________  Illinois Central GulL ___________________  Kansas City Southern ___________________  Long Island _______ --------------_______  MO-KS-Texas. _____ ------------------Missouri Pacific. ____ ------------------_  Norfolk & Western ______________________  Pittsburgh & Lake Erie __________________  St. Louis-San Francisco _________________  Soo Line ____________ ------------------_  Southern Pacific _________ ------------___  Southern Ry System ____________________  Union Pacific ________ ------_____________  Western Pacific ______ ------------------4.17  -1.52  .52  1. 46  -54.05  -2.23  4.40  3. 97  2.49  2. 07  4.26  2.82  4. 01  3.94  1.12  7  23  19  17  30  24  5  9  14  15  6  12  8  10  18  .152  .436  .499  .814  7. 754  .668  .162  .142  1.669  . 339  .425  .184  .233  .128  .266  5  19  21  25  30  23  6  4  28  12  18  7  8  2  10  As we move to floor consideration of  the rail deregulation legislation, I intend  to keep an open mind. But I would re mind my colleagues especially of  two  points. First, when we consider rail de regulation we are talking about a situation different from that in the instance  of airline and trucking for two reasons:  the relatively minimal Federal subsidies  to the rail industry and the lack of com mon access to rail routes. Second, while  deregulation should lead to improvement  . in  the  railroad's financial conditions,  that does not mean it will be a cure-all,  especially for the serious problem of rail  accidents.

This year, . we  commemorated  the  lOth  anniversary of Nick's capture  during the Vietnam war. In 10 years  our world has changed perceptibly,  the war in southeast Asia has ended, a  majority of servicemen serving in Viet nam have returned home to adjust to  a very different world from the world  they left. For some-for the families  of our 2,500 missing in_ action-the war  is a real in 1980 as it was a decade ago.  These  special  families  continue  to  search for the answers to the many  questions they have about their miss ing sons and husbands; and their lives  are filled with memories and possibili  ties. And yet, the days blend together  in uncertainty, and the days become  months, then years, then a decade.  Last-year at the annual convention  of the National League of Families,  family members prayed that next year  they would not be  in Washington  again, hoping that there would be no  need  to  return  to  another annual  meeting, another vigil at the White  House or another memorial of hope.  And yet, the answers have not come although  there  are many, many  clues-not this year at least. In fact we  will see the same families at this year's  meeting in June, and we will hope and  pray that maybe this meeting will be  the last.  Ironically, a month after Nick's lOth  anniversary, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks re ceived a letter from the Navy stating  that a  finding had been made that  their son had been presumed killed in  action. This  is  ironic because Nick's  status review, which took place in the  fall of 1978; had resulted in a majority  opinion that Nick was still alive-two  out of three hearing officers having  been opposed  to classifying Nick as  dead. In fact, there is evidence which  indicates that Nick was captured by  the enemy on January 2, 1970, tied to  a  tree and  thereafter escaped. His  whereabouts were never completely  -determined-and yet the presumptive  e ",1980

289,House,96,-0.514,602,11,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Chairman, I would  like  to  take  this occasion  to urge my  support  for  the approval of  the Fair  Housing Act Amendments of 1980 <H.R.  5200). Its passage would secure a foun dation for the struggle for equal oppor tunity that we must dedicate ourselves to  in the next deca:de.  Recent studies have shown that hous ing discrimination is still a major prob lem  in  the United States; one report  commissioned  by  the Department  of  Housing and Urban Development <HUD>  found that blacks seekingrental hous ing have an 85-percent chance of en countering some form of discrimination,  either explicit or implied.  Despite the current Federal fair hous ing laws,  title vm of the Civil Rights    H.R. 5200 is perhaps the most important  civil rights b1ll to reach the House floor in  over a. decade, and it has the firm backing  of this Administration.  Because the right to -equal opportunity in  housing is not backed up with an effective  administrative  enforcement  mechanism,  HUD has often been unsuccessful in enforc ing individual rights under the fair housing  law. Under existing law, HUD may only in vestigate charges of discrhnina.tion and at tempt -conc111a.tion  in the more than 3,000  complaints it receives each year. If conc111a. tion fails, as it frequently does because of  the voluntary nature of the procedure, the  individual's only recourse is to file a. lawsuit  on his own behalf. Because of the cost and  delay involved, individuals usually decide to  forego vindicating their rights, and look else where for housing. This makes HUD power less to redress violations against the law it  is  required  to enforce. And  the Attorney  General may only act 1f a.  case  involves  a.  pattern or practice of discrimination.  These are powerful and convincing  reasons to vote for this bill which essen tially provides more effective enforce ment mechanisms by putting in place a  mechanism within HUD presided over  by administrative law judges for enforce ment of fair housing laws. It also pro vides for the investigation of alleged dis criminatory housing practices at the ini tiative of HUD or an aggrieved party.  The provision of time limits for each  step in the process that would be estab lished and the administrative law judges  to  resolve  such practices  is a  vitally  needed  step  in  the  administration's  arsenal of civil rights and fair housing  laws.e   ",1980

296,Senate,96,0.433,732,11,Mr. HAYAKAWA.," Mr. President, we  are  presently  debating  the  issue  of  whether or not to give the President the  funds he has  requested  to  reactivate  registration for  the draft. He already  has the legal authority to begin regis tration-he is now asking Congress for   the necessary funds to carry it out.  The issue of whether or not we need  to bring back the draft to meet our de fense  requiremen:ts  is open  to debate.  Our military, both active duty and Re serves,  is desperately in need of more  and better qualified manpower. Many  knowledgeable people believe  that we  cannot meet that need without a draft  and they may be right. In any event, as  long as we have no draft we should at  least be willing to pay the price to re cruit and retain quality personnel. For  that reason, I support efforts to increase  military pay and benefits.  Peacetime manpower levels, however,  were never intended to be adequate for  our defense in the event of a national  emergency. That is one of the main pur poses for registration-to help prepare  the Selective Service System for a mas sive mobilization in the shortest amount  of time possible. The other reason for  registration  is  to demonstrate  to  the  Soviet Union that the United States is  willing and able to prevent further So viet expansion. In the many letters from  my constituents on this matter the fol lowing comment often appears:  I don't want my son or daughter to fight  for Texaco or Exxon!  The Soviet threat in the Middle East  is not to the oil companies. It is to the  very survival of the free world. An ex tended cut-off of oil to the United States  and our allies in Western Europe and  Japan would be paralyzing to the demo cratic world.  I would like to make another point.  My  constituents, especially  the young  ones, tell me ""that war is a bad thing  and  that  the countries of  the world  should resolve  their problems by  talk ing."" I can only say that I sincerely wish  that it were that easy. If peaceful de bate were all that was needed, we would  never have experienced World War II.  Hitler was not deterred in spite of the  fact that statesmen met before the war  to sign papers banning war for all time.  Lastly, I support registration on prin ciple. In an interview with Time maga zine Melvin Laird said:  Doing away with registration caused a sig nificant change in attitudes to the military.  Every young  person,  just by  the  act of  registering at age 18, was made aware of the  fact that he might be called upon. This gave  him pause to consider joining the m111tary.  I agree with Mr. Laird. It is time for  the United States to have a revival of  national spirit and will. In fact, 'I ulti mately would hope  to see our society  move toward a policy of national youth  service whereby our young people would  grow up  in an environment  in which  they would feel a sense of duty and obli gation to country to serve voluntarily in  some capacity-be it military or domes tic-for a year or two.

297,,96,-0.418,849,11,Mr. MOAKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, over  the  last weekend  another  needless  tragedy of a fire started by an unat tended cigarette occurred, taking five  lives in Columbus, Ga. Three of the  victims were aged 2 years old or less.  This incident furthers the need for  this Congress  to pass  the Cigarette  Safety Act, which seeks to insure that  cigarettes have a minimum capacity  for  igniting  smoldering upholstered  furniture and mattress fires. My bill  does not seek  to  stop people  from  smoking nor does it try to impose un reasonable constraints upon the tobac co industry; rather, it is an attempt to  reduce  the destruction  of  life  and  property.  Unfortunately,  the  tobacco manu facturing companies have not taken it  upon themselves to address this prob lem, so  I believe the Congress must  act.  Our efforts received noteworthy sup port  recently when  the Consumer  Product Safety Commission endorsed  tne Cigarette Safety Act. I would like  to share with my colleagues an article  that appeared in the Washington Star  on the Commission's action.  The article follows:  CPSC SEEKS AUTHORITY To CUT FIRE  HAZARDS BY REGULATING CIGARETTES  <By Caroline E. Mayer>  The Consumer Product Safety Commis sion is seeking authority to regulate ciga rettes and small cigars to reduce their po tential as fire hazards.  In a recent letter to Congress, the CPSC  endorsed legislation to permit the commis sion to draw up a self-extinguishing ciga rette performance standard. A requirement  for a self -extinguishing cigarette, the CPSC  said, would reduce the risks of upholstered  furniture and mattress fires started by smol dering cigarettes.  The commission's endorsement came  in  response to a congressional query on legisla tion  introduced by Rep. Joe Moakley, D Mass., and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. Ac cording to a commission aide, it is the first  time the commission has endorsed such leg islation, even though Congress considered a  similar measure five years ago.  But prospects for  the self-extinguishing  cigarette are still not very promising.  Twice, Congress  specifically has barred  the CPSC from regulating cigarettes, large ly as a result of opposition by the tobacco  industry-opposition which  congressional  aides say has not changed.  Then  too,  the measure will have  to go  through the Senate consumer affairs sub committee, which  is chaired by a  tobacco  state senator, Wendell Ford, D-Ky.  But despite the stiff opposition, the CPSC  is urging passage of the measure. The com mission suggests that if such a standard can  be developed, it would help reduce the 1,300  residential fire deaths caused annually by  smoldering cigarettes.  The commission is now working with the  upholstered  furniture  industry  to  reduce  the flammability of the furniture itself, but  the CPSC says both safeguards are needed.  Even with a cigarette standard, ""it would  still be necessary ... to continue efforts to  make upholstered furniture as resistant to  smoldering fires as reasonably possible,"" the  commission said in a letter to the House and  Senate conurierce committees last week.  ""Although we do not know whether a  technically feasible and effective <cigarette>  standard could be developed, the research  effort should be pursued since it could sig nificantly reduce injuries, deaths and prop erty damage from smoldering upholstered  furniture and mattress fires.""  However, the commission added, it should  not be forced to issue a standard if it discov ers that such a proposal is not feasible.  Citing National Bureau of Standards tests  which indicate that some furniture can be  ignited in less than two minutes by a smol dering cigarette, the commission noted that  a 2-minute self-extinguishing standard may  not be feasible because it ""is questionable  from both technical and consumer accept ance aspects.""'  Since the CPSC's creation eight years ago,  the  tobacco  industry  has  successfully  fought off all attempts to give the agency  the power to regulate cigarettes.  William Kloepfer Jr., senior vice president  of the Tobacco Institute said the industry  has ""no doctrinaire view for or against the  legislation"" at the moment.  However, Kloepfer noted,  ""the  tobacco  companies do not see  the opportunity  in  present  technology  to  accomplish what's  being sought and still produce a product  that would be acceptable.""  So far, no hearings on the legislation have  been planned. Senate aides say  they are  waiting for the House to act first because in  1975, the Senate approved a measure to give  the CPSC authority to regulate cigarettes  as an ignition source, only to have the provi sion withdrawn in a House committee.e  25th anniversary, I would like to take  this opportunity to pay tribute to it.  Ever since I came to Washington, 20  years ago, Roll Call has been a part of  my life here. Second only to payday,  the delivery of Roll Call is certainly  one of the high spots  in my office.  Unless I know where I am going to night, thanks to Don Hearn; unless I  know whose birthday  is coming up;  and unless I read Sid's weekly, or is it  weakly, attempts at humor, the whole  week is shot for me. The list of valua ble  information Roll Call  provides  cannot be found anywhere else. Where  else could you find out there was a  new intern down the hall? Where else  could you find out that a certain Sena tor has just hired a new receptionist?  Only in Roll Call. In fact,  it seems  everything you would ever want  to  know about Capitol Hill  is  in  this  newspaper.  Though we may joke at Roll Call, all  of us who work here appreciate the  fine job in helping to remind us that  Capitol Hill is more than just legisla tors  and  lobbyists. Capitol Hill  is  people, whether they vote on legisla tion, serve in Members offices, provide  food in our cafeteria's, or run our ele vators,  and Roll Call has  reflected  that fact  in  its 25 wonderful years  here. Its reporting is one of ups and  downs. In the same issue it reports of  the birth of a baby,  it often has to  inform us of a death of a colleague or  . loved one. But week in, and week out,  it has skillfully entertained us, and for  that, we can ask no more. To survive  on Capitol Hill for 25 years is certainly  quite an accomplishment,  and Roll  Call  is  to be  commended  for  still  having the same spirit and vigor it had  when it first was published.

299,,96,-0.042,862,11,Mr. HOLLENBECK.," Mr. Speaker,  today I introduced a resolution to ex press the sense of the House of Repre sentatives that vandalism of patriotic  monuments should be punished to the  fullest extent of the law. I believe that  this resolution effectively addresses a  problem  of  distressing  proportions;  namely, wanton desecration of patriot ic monuments. The individuals respon sible for such abhorrent acts are de serving  of  punishment which will  serve as a genuine deterrent to actions  of a similar nature.  In order to illustrate the emotional  trauma caused by this senseless van dalism, I include for the REcoRD porEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tions of the text of an article from the  May 1980, Veteran's Review of Bergen  County:  JWV POST OFFERS $500 REWARD  The reward is being offered for the arrest  and prosecution of the anti-Semitic crazy  bastard, or bastards, responsible for the des ecration of the monument  to  the Jewish  War Dead erected last year on River Road,  New Milford.  The monument has been turned over sev eral times since its dedication last year, but  this time the punks, went all out to destroy  the monument, causing very costly damage  even  to  the cement walk  leading  to  the  monument. They also cut down and stole  the American Flag  and  ripped  off  the  bronze donor plaque from the pole.  This senseless outrage, was definitely not  for profit, just an act of crazy, stupid hate.  The damage they created, can bring them  no profit. It only creates a very costly ex pense to the donors of the monument, the  Charles M. Wallach Post 773 of the Jewish  War Veterans, whose commander Sidney  Alpers has said the monument will be re erected.  The no good bastards also sent an un signed anti-Semitic letter, to the New Mil ford Jewish Center, warning of the intended  destruction. The letter has been turned over  to the Local and Federal authorities. Con gressman Hollenbeck  is  looking  into  the  Federal laws that were broken and intends  to introduce new tougher Federal Legisla tion.  These acts of senseless destruction have  been on  the  increase  in Bergen County  these past few years. A bronze plaque to the  War Dead was ripped off and stolen from a  Veterans' Monument  in  the  park  in  Westwood. This plaque has been on  the  monument since right after World War I.  Church  rectories  are being entered  and  robbed, poor boxes are being ripped open  and the money taken       even the Statue  of Liberty has been damaged.  It is high time to put a stop to this sense less, costly damage not only  to Veterans'  Monuments, but also to our public schools,   public  buildings  and  places  of worship,  Churches and Synagogues.  At this space in time, we not only remem ber our Honored Dead, but also take note of  what they and we fought for      Freedom.  Thereby, let all Veteran's Organizations in  Bergen County,  join  together  in a great  Crusade to free ourselves of this senseless,  shameful destruction, and make it our busi ness to catch the yellow bastards who are  responsible and put a stop to these shame ful acts. We should see that they are prop erly punished       for the people, the Veter ans among them, have to foot the needless  cost of repairing the damage.  It would  be  heartening  if many  people of good will see fit to join those  Veterans in meeting those costs.  Mr. Speaker, I am sure that we all  realize that this problem is not merely  limited to New Jersey. It is  time for  the House of Representatives to state  the collective outrage of the people  and to formally express its desire to  see the guilty adequately punished. I  look forward to swift passage of this  resolution by my distinguished  col leagues.e  June 11, 1980  CONGRATULATIONS TO SGT.  MICHAEL PATRICK MORGAN  HON. ROBERT K.

302,Senate,96,0.495,1083,11,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President,  I would  like to address briefly the issue of U.S.  foreign policy in respect to Latin Amer ica. As we are all well aware, this admin istration's policy has been marked by one  major failure after another.  The fact of the matter is that the Car ter administration lacks a comprehensive  and consistent policy for this region, and  it shows no clear resolve to create such  a policy. In the place of a coherent policy  designed to protect our national inter ests we are substituting naive,  liberal  humanitarian policies created by  the  Linowitz Commission and the Institute of  Policy Studies. The lack of an effective  intelligence agency only serves to aggra vate this already critical situation.  These fundamental problems are ad dressed concisely and with real insight  by FI ank Hamilton, the American Le gion's National Commander, in a speech  he presented before the Center for Inter national Security Studies of the Amer ican Security Council Education Foun dation. Mr. Hamilton's speech highlights  the dangers we  face  in  the Southern  Hemisphere, and his message is echoed  by a recent Heritage Foundation report  entitled  ""Soviet  Penetration  of  the  Caribbean.""  Mr. President, I ask that the text of  Mr. Hamilton's speech and the Heritage  Foundation analysis be printed in the  RECORD.  The speech follows:  THE SOFT UNDERBELLY  Gentlemen, it is a great personal pleasure  for me to be here to talk to you about our  favorite subject: the security of the United  States. I  feel a  little bit like I'm preaching  to the choir, yet at the same time, I  think  I've got a story to tell, which some of you  might not know, and which will give you  an idea of the direction The American Legion  is taking.  As I go around the country talking before  different Legion groups, the mood is obvious.  There is a growing dissatisfaction with what  is  taking place  in Washington. There  is a  feeling of frustration that our government is  not providing the leadership in resolving, not  only our own problems, but leading our allies  in resolving world problems. Often this frus tration approaches anger as veterans realize  tha.t  the  freedoms  they  have  fought  so  strongly for are being eroded through vacil lation, indifference and a constant barrage  of liberal ideas which are destroying the fab ric which made our country great.  Gentlemen, the Republic is in deep trou ble! We are living in times when each of us  must stand up and be counted. The time for  excuses is gone. The situation is serious. In  saying that, I'm not going to stand up here  and tell you about how we've been led down  the primrose path to the Rose Garden on  our way to accepting strategic parity, a pol icy which has slid us into second place ....  and I'm not going to talk about what we have  to do in the immediate future to develop our  Armed Forces so we are ""second to none.""  What I do want to talk to you about is that  region which we use to call our backyard.  That one we took for granted because they  were  just a  ""bunch of banana republics""  that weren't even worth bothering about.  Those were those places we used to have to  send in the Marines to just straighten out  their personal  in-fighting. Somehow  that  image has stuck. Oh yes, Fidel Castro has  been a bit of a thorn in our side. After all,  we thought we were going to overthrow him  back  in April 1961, but  the Bay of Pigs  failure took care of that abortive effort.  Somehow we  just wanted  it  to  settle  down .  .  . and at the same time we wished  those Cuban exiles  in Florida would  just  appreciate what we'd done for them in let ting them come to the United States to earn  a living, and not cause us so many problems  with  their  ranting and  raving over Fidel  Castro,  communism and  the Soviets.  .  .  .  ""Only 90 miles from home.""  Well, the point of it all is ... that little  problem won't go  away .  .  . and  it keeps  growing bigger all the time. Like most Ameri cans, I got all excited when President Ken nedy stood up  to  the Soviets during  the  Cuban missile crisis and made the Russian  bear back down, dismantle his ""rockets"" and  take them home. We had met the Sovi(ts  face to face, eyeball-to-eyetall and they had  blinked! American pride was assuaged! We  had avenged our failure at the Bay of Pigs  ... our national honor was saved.  (But I  wonder how many looked back and realized  that if we hadn't lost heart at the Bay of  Pigs, we wouldn't have had a Cuban missile  crisis!) And not  too many people  talked  about the Intermediate Balllstic Missiles we  had removed from Turkey and Italy at the  same time.  It was said they were obsolete and were  too costly to maintain. After all, they took  about 30 minutes to launch. No one spoke  of the added complexity those missiles pre sented to the Soviets in their targeting or  the problems  they created for  them in a  first strike option. No one mentioned how  having missiles in those countries not only  kept them in the front lines geographically  speaking  in any exchange of missiles, but  kept them in the forefront politically in our  NATO  alllance. But  that has  long been  forgotten.  Shortly after  I  became National Com mander, I decided that I would see for myself  what was going on with our Caribbean Basin  policy.

Tax receipts  have doubled since this administration  took omce.  To be sure, the President is not the only  one to blame for the fact that hard working Americans now have to work up  to today, June 12, just to pay their 1980  taxes. Much of the blame for this intoler able situation belongs right here in this  Chamber-with the Democratic majority  in Congress.  Mr. Speaker, the American people will  oblige the President this November. They  will come and take him out of the White  House.

304,House,96,-0.228,1096,11,Mr. BONER of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  when one television program can reach  upwards of 20 million people each week,  and when that show constantly depicts  immoral action in a positive and often  comic light, it has a significant impact  on the community values of our society.  I, along with millions of Americans,  am deeply concerned over the low moral  standards of today's television program ing. This concern has been expressed in  many ways, but none so convincingly as  the  ""Clean Up Television""  campaign  initiated  by  the  Joelton Church  of  Christ in Nashville, Tenn.  Under their leadership, nearly 400,000  people have pledged to boycott the prod ucts of the three top sponsors of today's  most otfensive programs unless there is  an improvement in those shows deemed  most objectionable.  This campaign does not advocate cen sorship.  It advocates  responsibility. If  those sponsors targeted do not heed this  consumer warning  to clean  their own  laundry,  they may face a boycott un precedented  in this Nation's history. I  am hopeful that they will act responsibly  and that there will be no need for such a  boycott.  I support this move tp clean up our  televisions, and I commend the etforts of  Brother John Hurt and the entire mem bership of the Joelton Church of Christ  for their leadership in this campaign.

Yet,  the one source of information I  find most enjoyable, the one newspaper  I notice being more avidly read by my  colleagues  in  the cloakrooms.  the one  publication snapped up by my staffers, is  Roll Call.  Why Roll Call, when it could be the  New York Times. the Washington Post,  the Los Angeles Times?

314,,96,-0.578,1213,11,Mr. STOKES.," Mr.  Speaker,  in  recent days, the eruption has been the  topic  of  conversation  in Congress,  throughout  the Nation  and  in  the  headlines of the media. I am not talk ing about the eruption of Mount Saint  Helens in Washington State. Rather, I  am referring to the eruption of dispair  and disillusionment by the black resi dents of Liberty City in Miami.  The people who have the power to  change these circumstances which led  to the riot, seemingly have been sur prised by the situation. They cling to  the belief that blacks have made tre mendous progress and such an out burst was not warranted.  My reaction is that these persons are  either blind to the turmoil and inequi ties in the black community or just do  not care what happens. It is evident by  the action of the Federal Government  that the poor,  the unemployed,  the  disadvantaged, minorities,  and  the  downtrodden have all but been forgot ten by this Nation. You may call it  racism or you may call it discrimina tion.  Regardless of the  terminology you  use,  the point  is  that we have  re gressed to a record low point in our  commitment to make this a land of op portunity for the poor. Unemployment  among blacks and especially among  black youth is at record levels. Health  care and human needs programs are  being cut back  and  in  some  cases  phased out totally. We are still delib erating on  a  balanced budget-one  which will be balanced on the backs of  the people who can least afford it.  The long hot summer of 1967 and  the conditions that brought it on are  fuming once  again. Miami was not  unique. The same thing could happen  in Washington, D.C., Cleveland, New  York, or any other major urban area.  History should tell us that band-aid  approach we took toward giving token  funds and assistance after  the 1967  riots and diminishing human need pro gram  funds  subsequently will  not  work.  I seriously question the sincerity of  the  Government's  actions  in  the  1960's. Now is the time to correct that  situation. What is needed now is not  the usual  liberal  lipservice. What  is  needed is a real commitment to social  and economic justice for the poor and  minorities in this country. This does  not mean just a  token effort by the  political powerbrokers in this Nation.  Recently, I had the pleasure of talk ing with  the religious editor of the  Cleveland Plain Dealer, Mr. Darrell  Holland.  14585  In the June 7, 1980, Cleveland Plain  Dealer, Mr. Holland wrote a very per ceptive article on the Miami riot com paring it somewhat with the eruption  of Mount Saint Helens in Washington  State. The  interesting point that he  makes is that scientists could not con trol the eruption in Washington State  but we could have  taken preventive  measures  to  avoid  the  eruption  in  Miami.  It is one of the best articles I have  seen on this issue to date. He suggests  in the article  that Miami may be a  warning and not the only eruption we  have this summer. I shudder to think  where the fire next time will be.  Mr. Holland's article also provides  some valuable  insight on what we  should have been doing and what is  needed for the future to insure that  all  Americans  regardless  of  race,  social, or political status enjoy those  inalienable rights we so proudly boast  about.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, at this time  I enter in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD,  the article by Mr. Darrell Holland:  MIAMI MAY BE JUST THE FIRST ERUPTION,  SoME WARN  <By Darrell Holland)  America may be in danger of some of its  urban centers exploding-like a volcano.  It is only a coincidence that at the very  time a live volcano began acting up in the  United States, a social eruption occurred in  Miami's black community.  In the case of Mt. St. Helens in Washing ton, the fury of nature was so cataclysmic  that scientists could not control nor predict  what would take place.  But in. the case of, the violence in Miami,  where blacks believed they were victimized  by unjust social, economic and  legal sys tems, society could have taken preventive  measures.  Warnings that the United States might be  in for a  slimmer of  racial  tensions have  come from a few religious leaders, who have  cited the Miami uprising and the attack on  the civil rights leader, Vernon Jordan, as  signs of trouble ahead.  Some view these troubles as the start of a  repeat of the summer of 1967, when urban  rebellions demanded equality  for  the na tion's black citizens.  Some of these fears were expressed last  week in a  letter to President Carter from  the Rev. Donald G. Jacobs, executive direc tor of the Greater Cleveland Interchurch  Council, and the Rev. Joan B. Campbell of  Cleveland, assistant general secretary of the  National Council of Churches in New York  City.  The Miami riots and the attack on Jordan  have heightened  tensions  throughout  the  country, they told Carter.  ""In Cleveland our people are frightened  because of plant closings,  impossibly high  mortgage rates,  inadequate education and  worsening unemployment,"" the letter said.  ""Our people are disturbed because govern ment programs which provide a  lifeline in  times of crisis are being dramatically cut  back.''

316,House,96,0.263,1239,11,Mr. TRIBLE.," Mr. Speaker, the press  reported recently that Secretary of De fense Harold Brown has ordered his dep uties in the Pentagon to exploit our Na tion's rising unemployment in military  recruiting efforts.  This can only leave Americans shak ing their heads. The administration ap parently proposes  to use  its bankrupt  economic  policy  to offset  its  equally  bankrupt military compensation po.l.icy.  The administration refuses to pay :our  military personnel adequately,  relying  instead on human hardship to provide  the requisite manpower.  It is also bad military policy. It does  not address the problem of the exodus  of  skilled  and  experienced  personnel  from  the military, our most pressing  national security problem. It can only  result in wild swings in recruitment and  retention. Coherent force planning will  suffer greatly.  The s~lution lies not in exploitation.  Rather, we must provide the incentives  to attract and retain a sufficient number  of quality personnel. Along with Mr.  BENNETT, I have introduced the National  Defense Compensation Act, which will  grant  the pay  increases necessary  to  insure that our manpower needs are met.  I urge my colleagues to join us in this  effort.  PROVIDING  FOR CONSIDERATION  OF H.R. 6413, NATIONAL AERONAU TICS AND  SPACE ADMINISTRA TION AUTHORIZATION .ACT, 1981  ",1980

319,,96,-0.173,1265,11,Mr. FUQUA.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in oppo sition to this amendment. The gentle man from Texas brings up a very in teresting point that has been discussed  and probably will be the subject of future  discussions within  the Committee on  Science and Technology. The committee  has already reported a patent policy bill  which deals with  the overall Federal  patent policy.

It  should be dealt with on an overall basis  as we have a uniform patent policy.

320,Senate,96,0.055,1317,11,Mr. STAFFORD.," Mr. President, I think  the amendment offered by  the distin guished Senator from North Carolina  has some attractiveness.  But let us take a look at what it might  do if that amendment is adopted by the  Senate.  Pursuant  to congressional direction  and funding, the Legal Services Corpo ration has now completed a 5-year ef fort to insure a level of legal assistance  to low income persons in eve!""Y county  in America. More than 1.6 million clients  were provided civil legal assistance pur suant to this effort in 1979 by more than  300  local  legal services programs gov erned by private attorneys and residents  of the communities.  The costs for  the administration of  the Legal Services Corporation has been  limited  to  less  than 2 percent of  the  funds appropriated by Congress which, I  think, is an unusually good record. It is  hamdle every dispute  through our lawyers  brings to mind Judge Learned Hand's remark  that he feared only death and 1llness as much  as a lawsuit. No less an authority than Thom as Ehrlich, head of Legal Services Corpora tion, has lamented, ""More and more  legal  pollution is clogging the everyday affairs of  all of us. Thickening layers of legal1sm seem  to surround our lives."" Ehrlich sees the cause  in ""too much law."" But the blame for too  much law can be laid on too many lawyers  and their dogmatic reliance on the adver sary process as a solution to all soolal prob lems.  Lawyers create law;  this is another con ceptual  problem with  large-scale govern ment  legal services. Legal services  lawyers,  by and large, do not see their role merely as  one of supplying a minor necessary service  to the occasional poor person  (like, say, a  public service dentist). The philosophy of  legal services  is that bringing poor people  into the legal system will lead to a whole scale betterment of their lot-that the ad versary system can be a major implement of  soC'ial change. This  is what conservatives  object to most 8/bout gOIVernment legal serv ices. Why should their tax dollars be financ ing efforts to change government policy in  ways they may not 91pprove of? But there are  other objections that liberals ought to take  more to heart. For the government to make  social polic'Y by hiring lawyers to file  law suits  inefficient and undemocratic. The  elabor81te adversary proceedings of the legal  process are no substitute for debate 1n an  elected forum. The very  idea that having  masses of  lawyers available  to  them can  transform  the  lives of poor people  is an  example of  the  sterlllty of most current  thinking aibout social welfare. Lawyers, psy chologists and social welfare bureaucrats of  every sort are provided in abundance, while  money and jobs are withheld.  None of this  to say that poor people  derive no good at all from  the legal serv Ices program. No doubt there are many who  have received valuable and Important legal  counsel and representation when there was  no other answer  to a problem. But there  are better ways to ensure that the noor halVe  ways of settling their disputes and protect Ing  their  rights,  such as eliminating  the  numerous restrictions that prevent competi tion among lawyers. An even more substan tial and far-reaching answer is to avoid re forms that encourage litigation and to nur ture those that help people to avoid it, like  no-fault insurance, arbitration, and media tion. Changes like these would reduce the  need for legal counsel, making all our lives  a bit simpler and considerably cheaper.  I  is  is  unlikely that there is another program  in  the Federal Government that allo cates 98 percent of its appropriated funds  for the direct provision of service at the  local level.  Inflation tragically hurts the poor. It  not only increases the number of per sons in need of legal assistance, but it  creates additional legal problems-such  as foreclosures, evictions and unemploy ment for those most in need. It is abso lutely essential in these times of crisis  that low-income persons are guaranteed  some minimal level of legal assistance.  All evidence indicates that the termina tion of  the Legal Services Corporation  will terminate the civil legal assistance  to the poor.  Legal assistance  is now available  to  more than 30 million low income per sons determined by  the 1970 census to  have an income at or below the official  poverty line.  The private bar cannot possibly meet  the needs of the poor for legal assistance.  Despite the efforts and encouragement  of the American Bar Association, State  and local bar associations and the Legal  Services Corporation, only a very small  percentage of the legal services to the  poor are available through the pro bono  services of the private bar. State and lo cal funding has also been a very mini mal source of funds for legal services.  There  is no  alternative  to  federally  :funded civil  legal assistance  for  this  country's poor.  The President's budget recommenda tion-which is the amount in the bill of  $321.3 million-reflects the tremendous  need for legal assistance to the poor. As  we are forced to cut housing, food stamps,  and other benefits, we must protect the  rights of the poor to receive the remain ing benefits. Legal Services make  this  possible.  I would point out to my distinguished  friend from North Carolina that if we  adopt his  amendment,  the additional  $21.5 million will be thereby unavailable  for achieving the goal of Legal Services  Corporation to provide two legal service  attorneys for each 10,000 poor people in  this <-ountry, and that principally the  rural areas, such as the rural parts of his  State and of mv State, which is the most  rural State in the country, in the opinion  of many, would be those which would be  deprived of legal services for the poor.  For those reasons, the Senator from  Vermont is unable to support this partic ular amendment.  think I can say that in the course  of hearings  in  the  subcommittee, on  which, frankly, I did not serve, Senator  HATCH supported the $321.3 million fig ure as a compromise which could be sup ported by the members of the committee.

324,Senate,96,0.029,75,19,Mr. SCHWEIKER.," Mr. President,  I  urge my colleagues to join me in support ing the Infant Formula Act of 1980.  Nothing is more critical to the health  and early development of our children  than proper infant nutrition. For mil lions of American babies, this means that  the formula they receive as the sole or  primary source of nutrition must con tain  adequate  levels  of  all  essential  nutrients.  Confidence in the safety of infant for mula was shaken last summer, when we  discovered  that two widely-used prod ucts had been reformulated and mar keted without  adequate  testing. The  products were  seriously  deficient  in  chloride. Lack of chloride can severely  impair normal growth and development,  causing a condition known as metabolic  alkalosis. The infants fail to gain weight  and develop normally. Long term effects  of  chloride  deficiency during  critical  months of infant development are still  unknown.  The Food and Drug Administration's  standards for infant formula,  in effect  at the time this problem was discovered,  were  inadequate  and  out-of-date,  in  light of current knowledge of what  is  needed for good health. FDA standards  did not  insure the safety of  the most  important food many children will ever  eat, and there were no testing or quality  control requirements in place to make  certain formula products were safe and  nutritious.  At the Heaith and Scientific Research  Subcommittee's hearings  in  June, we  heard moving testimony from the par ents of affected children. We heard about  the tragic human consequences of inade quate  testing, out-of-date FDA guide lines, and poorly implemented product  recalls.  Before us today is a bill that will go  far to correct these deficiencies by filling  in the gaps in FDA's regulatory authori ty and placing minimum nutrient stand ards  for  infant formula  into  law. Al though placing the standards in statute  may seem unusual, I believe it is war ranted  in  light of  the delays we can  usually  expect  from  the  regulatory  process. We need to insure formula safe ty by having the standards in effect just  as soon as possible, on enactment. The  standards in the bill reflect current scien tific  consensus,  as  developed  by  the  American Academy of Pediatrics.  The bill provides for future changes  in nutrient  level  requirements as our  knowledge of proper  infant nutrition  advances. Of particular concern to me ls  the amount of  iodine found  in infant  formula,  and  I  am pleased  that  the  Labor and Human Resources Commit tee's report on the bill directed the Sec retary of Health and Human Services to  give high priority to the need to curtail  excessive iodine consumption and estab lish an appropriate maxjmum for iodine  when the nutrient standards for infant  formula are updated.  This legi_slation is very similar to the  bill that passed the House of Represen tatives overwhelmingly and has the very  rare distinction-for a new regulatory  bill-of having been endorsed by the in fant formula industry as a worthwhile,  necessary and appropriate piece of legis lation. As ranking Republican member  of  the Labor  and Human Resources  Committee  and  its Subcommittee on  Health and Scientific Research, and as  a cosponsor of the Infant Formula Act,  I want  to commend Senator METZEN the infant formula industry, and  my other colleagues on the committee for  the admirable spirit of cooperation and  sense of responsibility that have been ex hibited  throughout the development of  this legislation. What we have is a work able response to a real problem, avoiding  the pitfalls of regulatory over-kill while  providing  needed  protection  for  our  children.

As a co sponsor of  the  earlier House version  of this bill, at this time I want to pay  tribute  to my colleague,  JACK WYDLER,  the retiring ranking minority member  of our Science and Technology Com mittee,  for his  efforts over  the years  to assure a strong national R. & D. pro gram.

326,House,96,-0.313,140,19,Mr. SMITH of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I  rise in strong support  of this bill which gives clear recognition  to  the different  impact which Federal  rules and regulations have on small busi ness as compared to big business. This  bill, S. 299, would require Federal agen cies and departments  to consider  the  impact of proposed rules and where ap propriate to exempt or adopt different  and  less  burdensome  regulations  for  small businesses, small nonprofit busi nesses and ~mall cities, towns, and other  political subdivisions. An exemption or  simplified regulation would be required  where the purposes of the law could be  obtained while doing so.  Similar  legislation  <H.R.  4660) was  extensively  considered  by  the House  Small Business Committee. The Subcom mittee on Special Small Business Prob lems held hearings in 1977 and 1978 and  developed the approach in the bill. The  Small  Business  Cammi ttee members  unanimously support that bill and each  of them are cosponsoring it. I want to  note that the House bill <H.R. 4660) was  unanimously favorably reported by the  Small Business Committee last October  and the bill was  then referred  to  the  Judiciary Committee which was  dis charged from further consideration on  May 28  of  this year. Meanwhile,  the  Senate substituted this approach for the  provisions in a bill they had held hear ings on and passed the bill.  Overregulation of small entities is one  of the ways big business has gained ad vantages over small businesses. The cost  per unit for a big business  to comply  may be small due  to a  large volume.  Small businesses cannot cope with the  maze of Federal regulations and  they  cannot afford the hiring of lawyers, ac countants,  engineers,  and  consultants  which are employed by large companies.  Nor  can  they  afford  their own  time  needed to comply with existing regula tions and reporting requirements.  As a result of overregulation, produc tivity and innovation have been curtailed  ,and inflation has increased and in some  cases  competition  from  smaller busi nesses eliminated. Our committee's files  are replete with documentation of these  burdensome requirements which range  from  one  company with  three  small  shops receiving Fede. al forms weighing  45 pounds  to another company which  paid a $500 fine rather than fill out a  Federal form which was 63-feet long.  I  also want  to point out  that some  laws and agencies currently use flexible  regulatory strategies such as the Internal  Revenue Code's provisions  permitting  salaried persons earning less than $20,000  per year to file a short form income tax  form while other taxpayers are required  to file the long form.  I believe that the provisions of this bill  now under consideration <S.  299) will  substantially reduce the burden imposed  by Federal regulation upon small busi ness and yet at the same time allow Fed eral departments and agencies to carry  out their duties and functions. Although  the Senate-passed bill differs in some re spects from the bill favorably reported by  the House Small Business Committee,  it is designed  to accomplish  the same  purpose and I hope that all Members will  strongly support it today so that it may  be sent to the White House without fur ther delay. For the benefit of my col leagues  I  am attaching a  brief state ment concerning the provisions of the  bill now under consideration.  I also want to point out that the con cept of two-tier regulation was one of the  issues considered by  the recent White  House Conference on Small Business  which  included a  recommendation  for  two-tier legislation as No. 15 on the list  of priorities. The Small Business Admin istration counsel for advocacy would have  the authority and responsibility to make  sure that agencies do as expected under  the law.  Finally, I want to commend all of the  Members who worked so long and hard  on this matter and particulary the chair man of our Special Small Buc:iness Prob lems Subcommittee, ANDY  IRELAND,  the  subcommittee's ranking minority mem ber' Mr. BROOMFIELD, and  the ranking  minority member on the committee, JoE  MCDADE. I also want to commend Repre sentative MARTY Russo who previously  served on the Small Business Committee  and chaired the Special Small Business  Problems Subcommittee. It was his initial  efforts  and  drafting which  laid  the  groundwork for the bill we are consider ing today.  The material fallows:  s. 299  (As passed Senate 8-6-80)  Sec.  2.

327,House,96,0.351,153,19,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup port of the bill, S. 299, the Small Busi ness Regulatory Flexibility Act. S. 299  amends  the Administrative Procedure  Act to provide for  increased flexibility  in the application of the Federal rule making process to small businesses, small  governnrental  jurisdictions, and small  organizations.  This measure  further provides  that  agencies must include economic and red tape impact analysis for small businesses,  small  governmental  jurisdictions  and  small organizations whenever  it pub lishes notice of a proposed rulemaking  and must give public opportunity to com ment on the initial analysis.  Moreover, this measure provides that  agencies must publish a final regulatory  flexibility ail'alysis when it issues a final  rule, explaining how rules can be ""tiered""  and offer reasons why less burdensome  alternatives were rejected. If the Agency  fails to do the required analysis or fails  to take its own study into account when  the final rule is published, the regulation  is subject to being struck down by the  courts. I want to point out that this act  does not deny  the statutory responsi bility of the agencies. On the contrary,  the act makes it perfectly clear to the  agencies that they have a congressional  mandate to adopt flexible alternatives.  By embracing S. 299,  the House can  take a quantum leap forward in the re duction of  regulatory burdens which  small businesses must shoulder. It must  be  recognized  that Federal  regulatory  policies work a hardship on the small  firm  that  the  large  is able  to escape.  Large firms have at their command a  myriad of resources-lawyers, account ants, and greater organization that en able them to absorb and sometimes de flect the impact of Federal regulations.  We must remember that in order for an  economic system to remain competitive,  it needs a strong and healthy small busi ness section and I believe S. 299 is a step  in the right direction  toward  insuring  thls goal.  ",1980
328,House,96,-0.163,153,19,Mr. LUKEN.," Mr. Speaker, I have al ways been a strong supporter of regula tory flexibility, because I believe burden some and unnecessary  regulations are  a threat to the survival of the small busi nesses of this Nation.  We are currently facing declining pro ductivity and innovation in the United  States. Small business can reverse this  trend if it is allowed to do so and is not  regulated to death. Time and time again,  small business has proven itself to be the  innovator in our country.  For example, during  the period of  1953-73, firms with less than 1,000 em ployees accounted for almost one-half of  major U.S. innovations.  Furthermore, the small business com munity has proven to be the backbone of  our economic system. Recent reports in dicate  that 43 percent of  the GNP  is  generated by small business and 57 per cent of all employees in the United States  are employed by small businesses.  In recent years, the regulatory burden  for small business has continued to in crease to levels that are suffocating their  entrepreneurial qualities. This paper work burden has spread to all types of  interact!on  that small businesses have  with the Federal Government. The Small  Business Energy Subcommittee, which I  chair, has heard testimony from numer ous witnesses on the number of forms  they must complete to apply for Federal  funding and Government procurement.  One solar small businessman stated that  he has a 4-pound application file, con taining 52 different forms, exhibits, and  financal statements, requiring no fewer  than 1,127 segments of data. Added to  thls were approximately 5,000 words of  narrative descriptions and thousands of  calculations and hundreds of hours of  preparation time.  Small businesses must be relieved of  this unnecessary and costly drain on  their time and financial resources. Small  business men and women cannot afford  to spend the majority of their time com pleting forms, nor should they have to.  If this trend is not reversed, many small  businesses will have to close their doors,  because  they cannot overcome the de mands imposed by the Federal Govern ment. We must not let this occur, but we  must do everything possible  to stand  behind the small businesses which are so  valuable to our Nation's well-being.  S. 299,  the Regulatory Flexibility Act  of 1980, is an important step in reducing  this disproportionate burden small busi ness faces. This legislation tailors regula tions to the size and capabilities of those  being regulated. Small business will no  ",1980
329,House,96,-0.35,166,19,Mr. ASHLEY.," Mr. Speaker, traditional  stocks of marine resources, once thought  to be unlimited, are now estimated by  experts to be canable of yielding a maxi mum global harvest of 100 to 150 million  metric tons per year. More conservative  estimates  rarely  exceed  100 million  metric tons, including that of the Na tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin istration which estimates the 100 mil lion figure will be reached in the 1980's.  World fish catches are currently around  70 million metric tons.  The present world population  is ap proximately four billion and is expected  to expand to 6 billion by the year 2000.  What these figures mean is that, on a  worldwide basis, we can expect a short age of fisheries products within the next  decade.  currentlv, more than 60 percent of all  fish consumed  in  the United States is  imported and aquaculture accounts for  3 percent of the anproximately 40 per cent produced domestically.

This year the City of Hope honors  with  their Humanitarian Award  a  pillar of our community and a person al friend, Mr. Lee Kearney.  Lee is best known as the secretary treasurer  of  the Teamsters Union  Local 952, a position he has held for 31  years.  In  that  time  local  952  has  become one of the largest locals in the  International Brotherhood of Team sters. Lee and  local 952 have  taken  some great strides and obtained  im pressive accomplishments together.  Under Mr. Kearney's  leadership,  local 952 has constructed one of the  largest group practice dental facilities  September 8, 1980  in Orange County and has comparable  facilities for medical, vision, and pre scriptions, serving all of the teamsters  and their families.  Lee  Kearney  has  demonstrated  skilled statesmanship and determina tion in the many contract negotiations  he made on behalf of his membership.  His skills and dedication have earned  the  respect and admiration of both  management and labor. It was out of  this  respect  and  admiration  that  Orange County labor recognized Lee  as ""Labor Man of the Year in 1973.""  In addition Lee has accepted the great  responsibility of serving as a  trustee  on the western conference of Team ster's pension trust.  Mr. Speaker, there is also another  facet to Lee Kearney. Aside from his  commitment to the working man and  woman, Lee has dedicated himself to  helping those who suffer, a commit ment best described by the credo of  the City of Hope that ""Health  is a  human right for all.""  Lee's work extended further when  he was appointed by Governor Jerry  Brown  to a  term on  the California  Hospital Advisory Council which dis bursed Hill-Burton funds for new hos pital construction.

339,House,96,-0.316,374,19,Mr. GORE.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to urge my colleagues to support H.R.  7956,  the Miscellaneous Revenue Act of  1980, which contains a provision which  I introduced. Section 107 of this bill is a  slight variation of H.R. 5643 which was  cosponsored by 130 of my colleagues and  is identical to H.R. 7520 which was spon sored by Congressman ULLMAN and my self. Section 107 is designed to preserve  the tax exempt status of rural electric  and telephone cooperatives by allowing  these cooperatives  to disregard  income  from pole rentals and display listings in  unrelated business  income determina tions.  I want  to commend Chairman  ULLMAN,  and Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI  for  their leadership in pursuing this impor tant issue.  Electric  and  telephone  cooperatives  are the backbone of rural America. Con gress helped nurture the growth of co ops in the 1930's and 1940's in order to  improve the quality of life in rural areas.  Privately owned utilities brought neces sary services to urban centers, but they  either could not or would not furnish the  needs of rural areas.  The goal of cooperatives is not to make  profits but  to bring reliable service at  the lowest possible price. This is one of  the principal reasons why we have seen  co-ops on the forefront of major tech nological changes and innovative, cost cutting measures.  There are more  than 1,000  electric  co-ops in this country in 46 States. They  provide service to 25 million people and  cover more than 50 percent of the land  area in the United States. Telephone co ops operate  in 30 States and provide  telephone service to more than 750,000  people. Co-ops are an indispensable part  of rural life and continue to provide op portunities for growth and development.  Unfortunately, it seems that the In ternal Revenue Service does not share  the enthusiasm of Congress for coopera tives. Recent  technical advice memo randa by  the IRS have attempted  to  chip away at their  tax-exempt status  and have placed unnecessary and un reasonable burdens on cooperatives. The  IRS memorandums have said that .in come from pole rentals and display list ings  in  ""Yellow Page""  directories  is  unrelated business income and therefore  taxable.  The IRS actions have two adverse im plications for co-ops. First, co-ops will be  required-for the first time-to pay taxes  on this type of income. In Tennessee, our  22 electric cooperatives could have to pay  as much a.s $800,000 in additional taxes  from pole rental income. Similar costs  can be expected from other States. While  this may not add up to a large tax reve nue for the IRS, it is the type of unneces sary cost which causes electric rates to  soar.  Second-and more importantly-these  IRS rulings could  jeopardize  the  tax exempt  status  of  co-ops  altogether.  Under present  law, a  rural electric or  telephone cooperative is tax exempt pro vided that 85 percent or more of its in come consists of amounts collected from  members for the sole purpose of meeting  losses and expenses. If the IRS position  is allowed to stand, many co-ops may be  faced  with  losing  their  tax-exempt  status. Worse  still,  if an electric co operative is in danger of reaching the 15  percent limit because of pole rental in come, it may be forced to tell the tele phone cooperative to build its own poles.  Imagine the esthetics, to say nothing of  the stupidity, of having two poles side  by side, one providing electricity and one  providing telephone service.  The IRS technical advice memoran dum on pole rentals argues that the leas ing of space on utility poles does not have  a substantial causal relationship to the  achievement of the exempt purpose of  the cooperative. I believe that, even in  the absence of this legislation, a strong  case can be made that this ruling is er roneous. And on the face of it, the ruling  strains simple logic.  Leasing pole space is integrally related  to the purpose of cooperatives. The pur pose of electric cooperatives, as s~en by  the legislative history of the Rural Elec trification Act, is to promote the public  good by providing area service  to  the  largest number of people at the lowest  possible cost. To effect this purpose, REA  has urged co-ops to enter into reciprocal  agreements for  the joint use of poles.  The  legislative  history  of  the  1949  amendments to the Rural Electrification  Act is replete with expressions of con gressional intent to cut costs by encour aging joint pole use.  The purpose of joint pole use is to elim inate duplication, to reduce maintenance  expenses, to promote sound engineering  practices, and to reduce the need to ob tain new rights-of-way. All of this is pre cisely within the purpose REA and Con gress envisioned for cooperatives.  is  However,  the  issue becomes clouded  because Congress did not enact the first  unrelated business income tax until 1950,  and cooperatives were not subject to it  until 1969. Thus, IRS can correctly argue  that Congress did not speak to this pre cise point despite the fact that the in tent to encourage joint pole use is very  clear.  Yet by looking to the policy behind the  unrelated business income tax, there is  further evidence that pole rentals should  not be included. The tax was designed to  prevent unfair competition with taxable  businesses. The IRS, for example, would  argue that money gained at a church  supper is taxable because the church is  in competition with the local restaurant.  But there is no such competition with  utility poles. Once one set of poles  erected, all other utilities will want to  share that pole, not build one of their  own.  I regret that IRS, in my opinion, mis construed the congressional intent in its  recent technical advisory opinions. Un fortunately, Congress must now reaffirm  its intent to exclude pole rentals and dis play listings from unrelated business in come  definitions.  Otherwise,  co-ops  around the country are going to have to  dig into their pockets and ultimately in crease rates to consumers.  I applaud IRS efforts to tighten the tax  laws, but I am afraid their efforts in this  area are  totally misguided. Enactment  of this bill will not provide any revenue  loss to the IRS because very little, if any,  money has been collected yet. However, if  this ruling is allowed to stand, it will ul timately be  translated  into significant  costs for co-ops, and  it will  frustrate  their efforts to meet the needs of their  customers.  On behalf of the 130 cosponsors of my  original bill and the many supporters of  the revised bill, I urge my colleagues to  act favorably on this important measure.

Mr. Chairman,  I  oppose  the Eck hardt amendment for several  reasons,  but  I  would  like  to  focus  on  one  particular  aspect more  substantially  than  the others. It explicitly  revolves  around the point of the short-line rail roads. There have been several refer ences  by  some  of  the  distinguished  speakers who have gone in the last sev eral minutes making significant refer ence to the fact that there is a serious  deficiency pertaining to  the short-line  protection, and I  think that the House  should be assured that there have been  extensive efforts in work by the com mittee  to  insure that the appropriate  protections are written into  the Stag gers Substitute;  to  insure that caprithe re to  cious and arbitrary actions cannot be  taken by class 1 or class 2  railroads  against  the  so-called  short-line  rail roads  through abandonment procedure  or through the surcharging procedure;  that  there  is  appropriate  protection  through  the 45-day notification, when  such action is taken by one of the Class  1  railroads  to  implement a  surcharge  or an abandonment procedure;  to in sure that the ICC is brought into the  situation under a 30-day  timetable  make a final decision to prevent against,  a capricious or arbitrary action via the  cancellation or surcharge mechanisms.

I  think that he conceivably misspoke,  because some  information that I have  indicates, for example, that the Florida  East Coast Railway is a class 1 railroad,  not a short-line railroad, and I  think  his information to be in error.  The other aspect  I would make  is  that the Short Line Railroad Associa tion, constituted of some 250 members,  supports this amendment, the Staggers  amendment, as does the American Farm  Bureau and numerous other organiza tions too lengthy to review.

I would also  like  to  thank  the chairman of the subcommittee and  the ranking minority member for their  assistance in working out the language  of this amendment.  an  Briefly,  the  amendment  does  two  things. It strikes title VII of the com mittee bill and  replaces  that with  a  process that establishes a process which  permits the Secretary of Transportation  to  initiate and consider the feasibility  of transferring Conrail property in the  States of Connecticut and Rhode Island  to another railroad. Since title VII was  adopted by  the committee  there have  been serious concerns raised by every one involved including Conrail, the De partment of Transportation, the USRA,  and labor organizations.  The major problems are all very com plex and involve the constitutional rights  of Conrail shareholders,  the rights of  Conrail as a corporation, the rights of  employees of Conrail, and the rights of  acquiring  railroad. Despite  these  problems the committee recognizes the  need for a new title VII.  Mr. Chairman, the amendment that I  am offering would, as the current pro vision in title VII, provide ""permits the  Secretary of Transportation to initiate  an expedited supplemental transaction  proposal  for Connecticut  and Rhode  Island.""

Almost  350,000 Americans will die this year as  a result of smoking-related illness, and  smoking will cause a loss to the econoEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  my of $12 to $18 billion in lost wages,  productivity, and absenteeism.  Tragically, Congress has  failed  to  forthrightly address this major prob lem.  Our  distinguished  colleague  from  the State of Massachusetts, Repre sentative DRINAN, has written a char acteristically  thoughtful  article  on  this controversial area of public policy.  I commend this excellent article to  my colleagues' attention.  GOVERNMENT MUST ACT ON SMOKING  PROBLEMS  <BY ROBERT F. DRINAN)  What is to be the role of the government  in formulating and generating the remedial  action on smoking called for by the Surgeon  General in 1964?  In the period from 1919 to 1933, the feder al government unwisely addressed the prob lems involved in the consumption of alcohol  by prohibiting the manufacture, sale, and  transportation of intoxicating liquors in the  United States. Although fourteen separate  states actually banned all smoking around  the turn of the century, prohibition clearly  is not an appropriate method in any effort  to discourage the cigarette habit. In a free  society, such outright government paternal ism is traditionally and rightly viewed with  apprehension.  As former HEW Secretary Joseph A. Cali fano testified to a House committee, our ef forts to reduce smoking must be ""grounded  in persuasion and information that appeal  to the common sense of our citizens       not efforts based on coercion and scare tac tics."" Government can and must act to uti lize more effectively its resources, within its  carefully limited role, to address the serious  problems engendered by cigarette smoking.  Perhaps the most important and effective  tool is education. In 1965, the Congress re quired that the packages of all cigarettes  sold in this country were to carry a warning  label. That act and others by  thirty-five  state legislatures to require school systems  to provide education on the health hazards  of smoking contributed to the present gen eral recognition of the unhealthfulness of  the smoking habit.  But how many smokers actually read and  pay attention to the warning label and how  many students heed the classroom admoni tions? A dim perception of long-term health  effects often cannot compete with present  realities of glamorous advertising, perceived  sophistication, and peer pressure. Thanks to  the effectiveness of the tobacco and adver tising industries, one soon knows of any new  cigarette  introduced on  the market. But  very few are similarly aware that 90 percent  of all lung cancer cases occur in smokers or  that tobacco  is more difficult  to give up  than heroin or alcohol.  From 1967 to 1971, these and other salient  facts were effectively communicated to the  American public through public service mes sages on television. Under a ruling of the  Federal  Communications  Commission  <FCC>.  television  stations accepting ciga rette advertisements were  required under  the  ""fairness doctrine""  to provide  equal  time to groups with anti-smoking messages.  Media  experts  have  pointed  to  these  ""counter-advertisements"" as one very  im portant reason for the major decline in ciga rette consumption during those 4 years.  Unfortunately,  the prohibition by Con gress of cigarette advertising on television  and radio removed the legal basis for these  ""equal time"" messages, which were thus no  longer aired. During the year the ban went  into effect, cigarette sales increased by 13  24929  billion, after having declined for the previ ous  few years. Further  testimony  to  the  popularity and effectiveness of these mes sages is the recommendation of the Federal  Trade Commission  <FTC>  that Congress  Consider legislation approaching funds for  cigarette public information campaigns con ducted via the mass media. Such a program  would serve to heighten public awareness of  the consequences of  smoking and would  counter the massive print media advertising  campaigns of the tobacco industry.  The FTC has also recommended consider ation of the implementation of a rotating  label warning system, as utilized in Sweden.  Since 1977 in that country, sixteen different  warning  statements-each  conveying  one  aspect  of  the  problems  associated with  smoking-have been displayed interchange ably on the cigarette package. This use of a  number of specific warnings not only com municates to the smoker more facts regard ing the pernicious effects of the smoking  habit, but in so doing also discourages the  practice of overlooking and ignoring a too familiar standard warning.  In the 96th Congress I have reintroduced  legislation I authored  in 1977  that would  mandate a  strengthening of  the present  warning  language now required on  labels  and in advertisements in the United States.  In  addition,  this  legislation,  the Public  Health Cigarette Smoking Act, would  re quire that the tar and nicotine content of  each brand be listed with the health warn ing and that these facts be printed in the  native language of each country to which  they are exported, and would  repeal  the  present prohibition on state legislation re garding cigarette warning labels.  RESTRICTION OF ADVERTISING  Many have suggested that perhaps  the  single most important anti-smoking measure  would be the restriction of cigarette adver tising. One suggestion would limit print ad vertisements  to a  straightforward ""tomb stone"" solicitation  including no scenes of  rugged adventurers or the like: simply the  brand, the health warning, the tar nicotine  contents, and any legitimate solicitations. A  total ban on cigarette advertising has al ready been  imposed  in Finland,  Iceland,  Italy, Norway, and Sweden. <Not coinciden tally, all but the first of  these countries  have  higher  life  expectancies  than  the  United States.) In addition to eliminating  much of  the  false aura of glamour sur rounding cigarette smoking, an outright ban  would free newspapers and periodicals now  accepting such advertising to be less hesi tant  to publish  investigative  findings  re garding the tobacco habit.  One such finding is that, in addition to  the  tremedous  health  cost  of  cigarette  smoking, the habit imposes a very real fi nancial cost to the federal government and  to the American economy. The most recent  report of the U.S. Surgeon General states  that health care now costs the nation ap proximately $205 billion per year, of which  the federal government pays $59 billion.  Despite the tremendous financial burden  placed on the federal treasury and the econ omy by  the  54 million Americans who  smoke, the federal cigarette excise tax has  not been increased since 1951, when it was  set at eight cents per package. As we strug gle  to  reduce  unnecessary  government  spending,  the government can no  longer  afford to subsidize the multi-billion dollar  public health cost of cigarette smoking.  This year I have introduced legislation in  the House of Representatives that would in crease by 10 cents a package the federal  excise tax on cigarettes. The measure would  increase the tax per pack from 14 percent of  the average retail price to 27 percent-still  ",1980
350,,96,-0.269,504,19,Mr. ANDERSON of California.," Mr.  Speaker, as you and the rest of our  colleagues know,  turbulence  in con gressional offices  is high. We accept  that, as to get bright young men and  women at the salaries we pay them, we  cannot expect to keep them forever.  But, once  in a while we are blessed  with a degree of retention and longev ity of a key staff person that provides  us with  the continuity and stability  necessary for an efficient office. But,  at the same time, we all recognize that  some day that person will leave-and  that ha.S  just happened  to me. The  person I am speaking of is the lady  who has been my strong right arm, my  confidant and adviser on many mat ters, and my district  representative,  Anna Ramirez.  Anna M. Ramirez started working  with me during my first campaign for  Congress back in 1968. She has been  with me ever since, first as a volunteer  on my campaign staff, and then on my  district office  staff. From observing  her  early work  in  the  office,  her  talent, dedication  to her duties, and  willingness to work long hours rapidly  became evident. As a  result,  I made  her my office manager in 1971 and my  district representative in 1975, a posi tion she has occupied ever since. And,  I might add, occupied it in a most dis tinguished  manner.  During  this  period, in addition to her office duties,  she attended night school and earned  her undergraduate degree.  Anna has been able to establish a  truly magnificent rapport with all ele ments of the widely divergent ethnic  communities  that  I  represent. She  treated  everyone who  came  to my  office seeking assistance or advice with  an even hand-be they black or white,  Hispanic or Yugoslav surnamed, deck hand on a fishing vessel or president  of a bank, they were all made to feel  equally at home and received the same  courteous treatment.  But Anna did not limit her activities  to my own office. She was widely rec ognized, not only throughout the local  South Bay area, but throughout the  State  for her  talent and  ability.  I  would like to share with you  just a  few-and  I emphasize a  few-of her  many appointments, designations, and  other activities, and some of the acco lades she has received. And, before I  forget, as a part of or maybe I should  say as an adjunct to her public life,  Anna has been mother of four. And  her offspring reflect the same interest  in the community as do their mother  and father, her husband, Arnold.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  In 1973, she was named ""The His panic Woman of the Year."" In this  same year she was presented with a  certificate of commendation by  the  Los Angeles County Board of Supervi sors for ""Dedicated Service to the Af fairs of the Community."" This award  was followed in 1974 by her receiving  ""The Golden Tortilla Award"" for out standing  services  to  the  Spanish speaking  community.  In  1975,  the  mayor and the city council of Los An geles presented her with a certificate  of appreciation for ""Outstanding Citi zenship Activities Enhancing Commu nity Betterment."" And as  a  logical  follow-on  to this award, she was ap pointed by  the Governor a  commis sioner on the California Fair Employ ment Practices Commission, a position  which she still holds.  She has been  a  delegate  to  two  White House Conferences, in 1968 the  White House Conference on the Needs  of Spanish Speaking Persons, and in  1970 the White House Conference on  Children. She has  represented her  country internationally as a delegate  to  the United States-Mexico Sister  Cities International in 1974.  Always active politically, in 1973, she  was elected  the first chairperson of  the California State Democratic Chi cano Caucus. In 1979 she was elected  secretary  of  the State Democratic  Party, and that year was also appoint ed cochair for Delegate Selection to  the Affirmative Action Committee of  the California Democratic Party. She  is currently the State president of the  Chicano Political Caucus.  One of the most valuable services  she has performed while in my office  has been that of training new staff  persons, not only in the normal office  routine, but more particularly in how  to deal with constituents and how to  recognize  the various problems  that  are bothering people when they come  to the office. For her,  there was no  such thing as a  trivial problem-if it  was a problem to the constituent, then  it was a real problem that we had to  solve. And  I  think  it  is noteworthy  that every one of the individuals she  trained has left my office and moved  on to a position of greater responsibili ty and higher remuneration.  I know that having heard of all of  her accomplishments, you may wonder  why I am letting her go. As a simple  matter of fact, I have no choice. Anna  and her husband recently invested in a  new business venture, and this is prov ing so successful that they are having  to devote more and more time to it.  And Anna Ramirez  is not a person  who will do anything halfway. She has  recognized  that she cannot give my  office her full support and at the same  time run her business as she wants to  run it. Much to my regret, the busi ness has won out.  I know I speak for myself and for  many  thousands  in  the South Bay  area. whom she has helped, either di rectly or indirectly, when I say that  she will be  sorely missed  from her  September 9, 1980  present position. And,  I  am equally  sure, that I can speak for those same  individuals as well as for my wife Lee  and myself in wishing Anna and her  husband, Arnold, her son Tom, and  her  two  daughters,  Barbara  and  Judith,  the very best  in the future.  While you may be gone, Anna, to use  the old cliche, you certainly will not  be  forgotten. And  in a newer vein,  ""Baby, you've got a long way to go.""e  A TRIBUTE TO THE HARRISON  LIBRARY  HON.

351,House,96,-0.044,517,19,Mr. GREEN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding. I think the ques tion is: Did we, in fact, get substantial  compliance from the administration?  I submit that there is much that we  did not get. I have reviewed the record  that was provided to the Judiciary Com mittee. I have not reviewed the files that  were provided to the Committee on In telligence, so I am making my remarks  strictly on  the basis of what has ap peared  in public print, plus what was  available  to  the Judiciary Committee,  material which  the chairman of  the  Judiciary Committee,  the  gentleman  from New  Jersey <Mr. Ron1No), very  graciously permitted me to examine as  one of  the principal  sponsors of  the  resolution of inquiry.  First, as the gentleman from Pennsyl vania <Mr. WALKER) has pointed out, we  did not get the material within the Jus tice Department relating to the 10-day  postponement of the investigation at a  time when  the Attorney General then  went to the President and discussed the  investigation with him. Certainly that is  crucial material.  Second, it is clear that we did not get  any material relating to the grand jury  investigation now going on in the south ern district of New York where it is now  a matter of public record that Billy Car ter did appear and testify. I hasten to  add that the press accounts say he was  not a  target of that investigation. But  what its relevance is to this inquiry we  really do not know.  We know also that, at least in the ma terial supplied to the Judiciary Commit tee, we did not get any material relating  to the fact that at a time when the At torney General was withholding from  his own subordinates, who were  fully  cleared for access to classified inf orma tion,  the information that he had re ceived with respect to the payments by  the Libyan Government to Billy Carter,  Dr. Brzezinski was giving that same in formation to Billy Carter. Why were peo ple  cleared  for  classified  information  denied this information when someone  with no such clearance and so  totally  unreliable as Billy Carter was given it?  Surely the material in the Justice De partment with respect to that, and they  are conducting an investigation of it, is  relevant. If that  is material  that  the  Judiciary Committee has to look at be hind closed doors, so be it. But that mat ter certainly should be pursued.  Finally, one has  to  look no further  than today's newspaper to see that a tar get of another investigation by the Jus tice Department relating to narcotics and  currency matters was one who helped ar range the alleged  loan to Billy Carter  by the Libyan Government. Again, there  was no material with respect to that in vestigation in the materials that I was  able to see at the Judiciary Committee.  In short, I would say to my colleagues  that there is a great deal of informa tion that was not made available to the  Judiciary Committee.  I would  suggest  along with  the distinguished  ranking  minority member <Mr. MCCLORY)  that  that ought to be pursued and the motion  to table should be defeated.  ",1980

355,Senate,96,-0.329,621,19,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. President,  last  Saturday morning, Ben Stong, my ad ministrative aide  for  a  little over  11  years, passed away at Sibley Hospital of  cardiac arrest. He had a  long and dis tinguished career on the Hill-25 years,  as a matter of fact-first as a profes sional staff member on the Senate In terior Committee for Senator Murray,  then chairman. He also stayed on the  committee when Senator Murray retired  and Senator Anderson became chair man. He was with Senator McGOVERN  for a number of years before joining my  staff as administrative assistant.  Ben was  recognized as  the dean of  agricultural advisers on the Hill. He was  active in the conservation movement all  during his career on the Hill and prior  to coming to the Hill. Many called him  the father of the Wilderness Act, he hav ing convinced Senator Murray to start  hearings in the late fifties in the Senate  Interior Committee on  that proposal,  which was eventually enacted in 1964.  We shall miss him greatly in my office,  as will a great number of people through out Government, both in the executive  and legislative branches.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have printed in the RECORD  a  eulogy I gave at Ben's memorial service  last evening.  There being no objection, the eulogy  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  EULOGY TO BEN STONG  (By Senator JOHN MELCH'ER)  Family of Ben, Friends of Ben:  Last Saturday morning Ben's sojourn with  us came to a close.  It was 75 years and a  few months. Ben's  was an active life-until only one week be fore, from the last Saturday in August when  he  entered  Sibley Hospital  on  his  own  power until Saturday morning September 6  when cardiac arrest ended three-quarters of  a  century  during which Ben was many  things to many people.  Ben was wise.  Ben was experienced. He was real.  Ben was articulate.  Ben was resourceful-his memory remark able.  good  humor,  Ben was helpful-always available.  Ben was strong-always compassionate.  Ben was fun.  Ben loved people.  Ben loved life.  He lived with zest.  He relished confrontation,  Engaged  in  debate with  honor and truth.  The very essence of Ben was the combina tion of all these attributes. All  joined and  blended into his character.  Then all of it was coupled with his re marka,ble energy that sorted Ben out from  the pack and distinguished him among men.  as the-Stalwart sage of agriculture;  Leader of the conservation movement;  An expert on water development;  An effective proponent of rural electrics;  and  A determined advocate of a better econ omy and a better life for all of rural America.  How did this man come to mean so much  to so many?  What gave Ben his drive, his vigor in pur suing goals-to continua.Uy strive  to help  and to prod and to persuade people in gov ernment to make good, honest and progres sive decisions?  Let's look back-his roots were in Iowa. born in the village of Keosauqua in 1905, the  son of Ben and Ada. Stong and the brother  of Phil and  Jo. Ben, Sr.  ran  the  town's  general store and was  the Postmaster. His  grandfather had  tried  the California. Gold  Rush but was known better in Iowa. as the  founder of Iowa's first State Fair. That may  have been an inspiration  to Ben's brother  Phil, who wrote  the novel,  later  a.  great  screen play-""Sta.te Fair."" Brother Jo be came a banker-lawyer-two professions Ben  loved to chide with puckish, populist flair.  Ben received a. degree in Journalism from  Drake University, Class of 1927. He reported  first  for  the Des Moines Register. He was  confident, energetic, brash.  fun-loving, oc casionally a. hell-raiser, and he pursued with  enthusiasm a. highly successful journalistic  career for  a. decade or more with Scripps Howard papers. These  included  first  their  pa.per in Cleveland, Ohio, then State Capitol  Bureau Chief a.t Nashville, Tennessee, editor  of the News Sentinel at Knoxville, and later  as Scripps Howard's Washington correspond ent.  Ben's style of writing was direct and clear.  His style was honest and pointed-depth and  plenty of punch. That style came natural for  Ben because that was the way his thoughts  flowed from his mi.id. No phoniness-he did  not need gimmicks-he had truth, knowledge,  experience on his side.  There was for Ben during the 40's a.  time  of striving for the basics for western agri culture. Ben was at the very grassroots, or ganizing for  the Farmer's Union in Rocky  Mountain states.  He understood the crying need for farmers  to organize-a need that, till the end, he held  high in his priorities and in his hopes for  the future  to assure agriculture producers  a. sufficient voice to assert and claim adequate  policies for price and management for this,  our best, biggest and most basic of American  industries.  Ben never gave up on that. Farmers' Union  and National Farmers' Organization knew his  efforts firsthand, but all fa.rm and agricul tural  commodity  organizations benefitted  from Ben's progressive influence in drafting  major farm  legislation covering a  span of  more than two decades.  His style was as refreshing as spring. When  he  drafted  legislative  language,  bill  or  amendment, it was concise, clear, direct--a  welcome relief from much of the foggy leg islative language we see in what we some times call ""Foggy Bottom.""  We cannot understand Ben's strength of  character and will unless we relate it to the  strength and wm power he demonstrated to  reject the personal use of alcohol during the  last half of his life. It was his strength to  overcome what had been for him an abuse his rejection of persona.Uy indulging in al coholic beverages was complete, and he per sistently was willing  to assist others who  needed and would accept guidance on the  use of alcohol.  Ben was at home with the soil and growing  plants. His dahlias were sweepstakes win ners-they reflected the magnificent beauty  he  understood  and  appreciated  in  the  harmony of earth and water-plant and ani mal life.  In 1955, when Ben joined Senator James  Murray and the Senate Interior Committee  staff, his conservation leadership blossomed  and bore fruit.  He fathered the Wilderness Act, convinc ing Murray  that  the  Senate Committee  should hold hearings. And out of those initial  hearings in the 50's the Wilderness advocacy  of  a  few  became  the national will  and  passage of  the Wilderness Act  resulted  in  1964.  By  then, Ben was with Senator George  McGovern and drafted the Voluntary Wheat  Certificate Plan, successfully sponsored and  brought to enactment by Senator McGovern.  Ben's honors included recognition in 1967  as a.  lifetime member of the Soll Conserva tion Service, American Motors Conservation  Award  in 1964, East River Co-op Service  Award in 19.!)8, George W. Norris Award of  Western States Water and Power Consumers'  Conference in 1966.  Ben was proud of membership in the Dar row Conference on Mathematical Probabili ties-he listed it in all of his resumes. He  should also ha. ve noted he was one of the  founders of this illustrious group that met  periodically  to out-bluff or out-draw ea.ch  other  in  the mathematical probab111ty of  poker.  He was good at poker and attempted to  pass on this skill to his grandchildren when  a. big blizzard made him snowbound with  Norma and Joe Lyon on their Iowa. farm. Ben  ran  the poker game during  those 5 days,  teaching  the grandkids  the mathematical  probabilities,  using  toothpicks  for  poker  chips.  Ben was a most generous person with his  time. He was patient and although many  sought his help, his counsel or his judgment  that kept him always busy, he gave of his  time to all of his friends and fellow work ers. Of an early morning or late evening sit ting at his desk with his feet propped on a  corner,  puffing on  a.  cigarette  (he  loved  nicotine) and with his fancy, attractive cuff  links, one could find the almost unbounded  range of Ben's  interests and the depths of  his understanding of the need of people for  government--,a better government.  Ben staunchly advocated balanced growth  for the U.S. with reasonable regulations that  did not interfere unduly or stymie the free  enterprise system. Above all, he had faith in  the a.bili ty of people to come together and  discern what was in the public interest and  for the common good.  He was concerned for the underprivileged,  for the poor and the hungry.  He related trade policies to needs of people.  He  related Food Stamps as essential for  the hungry poor.  Food for Peace for starving people abroad.  Compassion for refugees seeking our help not. a popular issue right now but one on  which Ben spoke out.  _ Health needs  for all who were  tn need.  Ben knew and practiced Charity in the  broadest sense.  He had no time for grudges. While r do  not believe he hated anyone, he had firm  disdain for fraud or phoniness.

356,Senate,96,-0.443,647,19,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  it is  clear that the Soviet occupation of Af ghanistan has created strains in United  States-Soviet relations and prompted a  reappraisal of the bilateral relationship.  In a thoughtful article in the August 3  edition of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,  David Linebaugh, former deputy assist ant director of the U.S. Arms Control and  Disarmament Agency,  addresses  the  fundamental  issues underlying our re lationship with  the Soviet Union and  methods for resolving them.  Mr. Linebaugh states:  The obligation of American leadership  is  both to protect the nation with a strong de fense and to explore the possibilities for eas ing tension and finding common ground with  the Soviet Union.  He claims that if we are to accept the  fact that our relationship with the So viet Union will be ""differentiated""-that  is, containing ""some good elements and  some bad elements""-then we must not  foreclose opportunities for cooperation.  In particular, we niust engage in nego tiations on ""the  issues currently most  critical  to United States-Soviet  rela tions-Afghanistan,  the nuclear  arms  race in Europe, and SALT.""  Mr. Linebaugh states that the goals  of negotiation cannot be readily achieved.  But he claims that:  The United States has powerful bargaining  cards: normalization of  relations  in trade,  grain sales, and exchanges; participation in  guarantees against interference in Afghan istan's  internal  affairs;  a  return  to  even handedness in our relations with Russia and  China and others.  Most  important, negotiation remains  the only means for achieving such im portant objectives as a near-term Soviet  withdrawal from Afghanistan and a halt  to the race in theater and strategic nu clear arms.  Mr. President, United States-Soviet re lations are in a state of flux. But certain  principles for guiding our relationship  with  the  Soviet Union  remain  un changed: We must both oppose Soviet  aggression and search for ways to reduce  tensions. I submit Mr. Linebaugh's arti cle for printing in the RECORD.

357,,96,-0.027,686,19,Mr. ENGLISH.," Mr.  Speaker,  on  July 26, 1980, a meeting was held in  Ottawa, Canada, between Members of  the U.S. Congress and the Canadian  Parliament. The meeting was  held  under  the auspices of  the Canada United  States  Interparliamentary  Group to discuss cooperation in devel oping policies  to end  the export of  wheat at prices below farmers' costs of  production.  Members from the House of Repre sentatives besides myself who attend ed the meeting were Representatives  STANGELAND,  HIGHTOWER,  STENHOLM,  DASCHLE, HANCE, MARLENEE, and JEF FRIES. Members of the Senate attend ing were Senators ZORINSKY. BELLMON.  MELCHER, McCLURE, and PRESSLER.  The focus of the discussions was not  to propose drastic alterations  in the  wheat marketing system of the United  States or Canada. Quite differently,  the discussion  focused on gaining a  better understanding of each country's  marketing system in order to provide  better cooperation  through  existing  market structures.  The United States and Canada con tinue to account for about two-thirds  of all wheat  traded  in  international  commerce. Wheat exports  from  the  United States alone have doubled in  the past decade, in large part due to  efforts by farmers themselves through  organizations such as U.S. Wheat As sociates. It is clear that these exports  have contributed significantly to the  United States balance of payments,  and have been a major means of off setting large U.S. trade deficits.  However, as wheat exports have con tinued to increase, so has farm debt,  and more and more farmers have been  forced out of business by producing  large amounts of grain at a loss.  The efficiency and productivity of  American grain farmers are being ex ploited to enhance our balance of pay ments while at the same time provid ing wealthy industrial nations such as  Japan and the Soviet Union with a  cheap source of food. An increase in  the world price for wheat would not  significantly decrease our exports  to  developed countries since Japan and  the European Economic Community  impose substantial import levies.  September 10, 1980  These are some of the considerations  that have prompted the continuation  of discussions between Canada and the  United  States  concerning  wheat  export policy.  As  a  result of our discussions  in  Ottawa,  the  legislators  from  both  countries agreed that there is a defi nite need to improve cooperation be tween the major wheat exporters, and  to end the export of wheat at prices  below the cost of production.  To  reach  this  specific  goal, both  groups agreed to recommend to their  respective  legislative  bodies  that  a  joint Canada-United States commis sion be established. For that purpose I  am  today, along with my colleagues  who attended the meeting in Ottawa,  introducing a resolution for the estab lishment of such a commission.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of this resolution be  printed in the RECORD at the conclu sion of my remarks.  H. CON. RES. A bill expressing the sense of the Congress  with respect to the export of wheat, and  for other purposes  Whereas current world market prices for  wheat are below the cost of production;  Whereas more than one-half of all wheat  produced in the United States is exported;  Whereas Canada and the United States  together supply approximately  two-thirds  of the world wheat trade;  Whereas the four principal wheat export ers supply more  than 80 percent of  the  world's wheat exports;  Whereas wheat exporting countries have  traditionally  carried  a  disproportionate  share of the world's wheat reserves, result ing in higher costs for United States wheat  producers;  Whereas expanded and improved storage,  processing,  and  distribution  facilities  in  wheat  importing countries would  increase  wheat utilization capacity, and thereby in crease the total world wheat market: Now,  therefore, be it  Resolved by the House of Representatives  <the Senate concurring), That it is the sense  of the Congress that there should be estab lished a Joint Canada-United States Wheat  Export Coordinating Commission <herein after referred to as the ""Commission""), the  purpose of which shall be to develop mutual  policies whereby each participating country  shall< 1 > end  the export of wheat at prices  below the cost of production;  <2> promote  long-range market develop ment;  <3>  increase commitments to food assist ance programs; and  <4> encourage wheat importing nations to  increase their storage facilities in order to  share in the responsibility of holding wheat  stocks and reserves.

358,House,96,0.097,920,19,Mr. MITCHELL of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  the bill, H.R. 7626, as amended. As the  chairman of the Military Compensation  Subcommittee has pointed out, we have  acted on a considerable range of initia tives in the field of military compensa tion during  this Congress. The provi sions of H.R. 7626 not yet enacted will  fill in some of the remaining gaps in the  overall compensation  initiatives  taken  by this Congress.  One of the major provisions of  the  bill authorizes for the first time a. spe cial pay for enlisted members in certain  their overseas  specialties who extend  tour for at least a year.  The purpose of the proposed special  pay is  to assist in alleviating a prob lem of manning skills in which the ma jority of  the skill requirements are in  overseas areas. In many instances, this  imbalance results in members being re quired  to be reassigned overseas after  less  than  24 months  in  the United  States. The situation is cited by many  NCO's as  their reason for  leaving the  service.  The bill would provide a payment of  up to $50 per month for each month of  an extension.  As an alternative to the $50 monthly  special  pay,  a  service member who  agreed to extend overseas for 12 months  could elect to receive one of the follow ing:  First. A 30-day rest and recuperation  absence from duties not chargeable to  leave;  Second. A 15-day rest and recuperation   absence from duties not chargeable to  leave and transportation at Government  expense to and from the United States  for the member; or  Third. Round  trip  transportation at  Government expense  for  the member  and his family to the United States.  Surveys  indicate  that  this proposal  would assist in alleviating the overseas  skill imbalance problem.  Another major provision would ex tend ftexibility  to senior enlisted per sonnel and junior officers without de pendents by permitting  them  to elect  to  live off base and draw  their basic  allowance quarters.  At the present time an officer in the  grade  of major  or  lieutenant  com mander--or above--without dependents  for whom Government  quarters  are  available may elect not to occupy those  quarters and instead elect to receive the  basic allowance for quarters appropriate  to his grade.  H.R. 7626 would extend this privilege  to all personnel without dependents both officers and enlisted personnel who  are in pay grade E-7 or above. This priv ilege would be extended to naval per sonnel  on  sea  duty  if  in  port  for  extended periods. For those naval per sonnel, eligibility for optional basic al lowance for quarters would end if the  unit to which they are assigned is de ployed  for a period of more  than 90  days.  This provision would remove an irri tant for our more senior enlisted mem bers without  dependents who would  pref er to reside in quarters of their own  choosing.  Many military personnel, faced with  the high cost of housing, have chosen to  purchase a mobile home. Trailer pads  have been established on many Govern ment  installations  to  accommodate  these personnel.  At present, military personnel with  mobile homes who occupy trailer pads  on Government  installations  pay  a  rental fee that covers utilities, mainte nance, and an amortized share of the  cost of construction.  The Department of Justice has ruled  that those trailer pads are technically  within a statutory definition of Govern",1980

Mr. Speaker, I  have no further requests for time, and  I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in support of H.R. 7974, which would re vise  the  composition  of  the  Judicial  Councils of the Federal Judicial Circuit  and establish a procedure for the proc essing of  complaints  against Federal  judges.  I think we all recognize that impeach ment  is a  cumbersome and unwieldly  process, as evidenced by the fact that in  nearly 200 years only 54 judges have been  investigated and of these, only 8 judges  and  1  justice have been  impeached.  Furthermore, o~ly four judges have been  removed, with the last impeachment of  a Federal judge occurring over 40 years  ago. However,  the structuring of  im peachment as a difficult process was, I  believe, not unintentional, for by so do ing the Founding Fathers provided pro tection  for  the  independence of Fed eral judges who in many cases must ren der  unpopular  decisions.  Something  fairly egregious has to occur before im peachment is restarted to, yet there are  cases involving Federal judges that need  redress, short of impeachment.

362,Senate,96,0.172,1011,19,Mr. YOUNG.," Mr. President, when the  railroad deregulation bill was debated on  the Senate floor in April, a number of us  were  taken  in by a  last-minute floor  amendment which provided for joint rate  surcharges  and  cancellations.  The  amendment was promoted by Conrail  and Southern railroads as a significant  and essential step toward solving Con rail's perpetual financial crisis. While a  brief  legislative  explanation was pro vided  to us on the floor, hindsight has  demonstrated that the explanation was  at best incomplete and may well have  been misleading.  The law presently provides a  remedy  for carriers which are not receiving a  fair or adequate share of the revenues  from a  joint route. In a ""divisions pro ceeding"" before the Interstate Commerce  Commission, the disadvantaged railroad  may argue that the other railroad(s) in volved  in the joint route are not equi tably sharing the revenues from the joint  rate charged the shipper. If successful,  the disadvantaged railroad is awarded a  larger portion (division) of the income,  and the income of the other railroad<s)  involved in the joint route are adjusted  downward  accordingly.  ICC's decision  on  the division of  the revenue affects  only the railroads involved and cannot  result in a higher rate to the shipper.  The joint rate surcharge and cancella tion provision which the Senate approved  in December makes the division proceed ing a less desirable method of resolving  inequitable or unjust divisions of rev enues on joint routes. The surcharge pro vision says that when the disadvantaged  carrier is receiving less than 110 percent  of variable cost on its portion of a joint  route, it is entitled to improve that in come by applying a surcharge to its por tion of the rate. The shipper pays the  surcharge, and  the disadvantaged car rier has no reason to dispute how much  of the revenue from the basic rate might  be flowing to the other railroads which  are partners  in  the  joint route. Con versely, rail partners in the joint route  are not entitled to any of the disadvan taged carrier's revenue  from  the sur charge.  What was not explained to the Senate  is  that the criteria of ""110 percent of  variable costs"" acts as a  trigger-not a  ceiling. If the railroad is receiving less  than 110 percent of variable cost, that  finding makes the railroad eligible to ap ply a surcharge. A number of my col leagues acted on the presumption that, if  eligible  to apply such a surcharge, the  railroad could only then surcharge its  portion of the joint rate to the extent  that the basic rate plus the surcharge did  not exceed 110 percent of variable cost.  It was some days after the Senate took  final action on the rail deregulation bill  that we found out no such ceiling exist ed; that, in fact, we had passed language  which said the sky is the limit on the  level  to which surcharging may legally  increase freight rates. It was computed  that even if a ceiling had been placed at  110 percent, that alone would immedi ately result in surcharges of more than  a billion and a half dollars.  It was not adequately explained to the  Senate that the authority to cancel joint  routes could effectively terminate serv ice to thousands of agricultural shippers  and  could  result  in  double-to-triple  transportation costs  for  thousands of  others.  The same ""below 110 percent of vari able costs"" triggers a railroad's right to  simply cancel its participation in a joint  route. This means that shippers who use  that route have to approach each rail road between them and their market to  get individual quotes for that segment of  the trip. The rates on these ""local move ments""  tend to be a great deal higher  than the combined joint rate for a long haul across two or more rail systems. In  fact, by the time you total up the local  rates which will get a shipper to his his toric market, you could have a  figure  which is two to three times higher than  the  jo!nt rate which can be canceled  under the new powers given the rail com mon carriers  in both  the Senate and  House bills.  Obviously,  the higher  transportation  costs will make it difficult or impossible  for shippers  to compete effectively  in  their established markets. Many will find  new markets, but the higher transporta tion costs will still exist in the aggregate  and will be passed along to consumers.  Many rail shippers will  turn  to other  modes of transportation-trucks, which  are far less energy efficient than trains,  or barges,  a  geographically  restricted  method of transportation with an inflex ible capacity for expansion.  In time, demand for rail service along  joint routes which have been surcharged  01 canceled will  lag dramatically, sig naling to rail management that aban donment of  the  line might be  in  the  transportation company's best interest.  The  rail deregulation bill provides  in  another section for expedited abandon ment procedures-another provision tai lored to accommodate Conrail's manage ment difficulties. If you combine the ef fect of joint rate surcharges and can cellations with  the new proVIS10ns  for  expedited abandonment, you have the  potential for wholesale abandonment of  most of the branch lines serving agri culture and nonurban industry in Amer ica. The Nation will be left with a trans continental,  gateway-to-gateway  rail  system of main lines to which most ship pers will have difficult or no access.  We were given no time to deliberate  and understand this in the Senate last  April. The House of Representatives had  every opportunity to examine the joint  rates provisions and that process led to  one of the stormiest debates Congress  has seen in some time.  Even knowing as little as we did about  the potential h::irm of surcharges and  cancellations, the Senate approved  the  amendment by a slim margin of eight  votes <52  to 44). The legislative process  does not now allow us to step back and  reverse that position. We are, however,  still in a position of some flexibility in  tailoring the final version to be approved  by the conference committee. The Sen ate version of  the surcharge/cancella tion  authority  is  extremely broad  in  scope-so bl-oad as to be frightening if  left totally in the hands of Federal regu lators to interpret. The House version,  on the other hand, is extremely narrow  and precise in its language, and promises  to do all the damage I have described  with the exception that it does use 110  percent of variable cost as a ceiling on  .surcharging.  In between  these vastly  different versions is an answer which will  do the least amount of damage to the  rail transportation system and its ship pers. It is my hope to work with others  in finding this answer and to vote against  the conference report if a serious effort  in that direction is not made.  I would offer one specific suggestion at  this time. The rail deregulation bill does  not repeal the existing law which estab lishes the forum for divisions proceed ings at the ICC. As a matter of fact, the  ICC itself under existing authority could  do much administratively  to expedite  those  divisions  proceedings. Southern  Railway and a number of other rail ro1ds  have  effectively  utilized  that  forum  to work out their revenue prob lems among themselves. Conrail has not,  yet demands that it be given authority  to increase revenues by taking it away  from shippers and consumers with a sur charge. While  the conferees are work ing to see that the surcharge allows the  least amount of mayhem in the Nation's  rail system, I would ask that the ICC in ternally ""deregulate"" and expedite the  divisions proceeding process into an ef fective, workable tool.  Mr. McGOVERN.

363,Senate,96,-0.095,1076,19,Mr. ZORINSKY.," Mr. President, as Sen ators are aware, the Senate is preparing  to go to conference with the House to  iron out  the vast differences between  their respective versions of the rail de regulation bill. We finished our work on  that issue last April and have not had to  greatly concern ourselves with provisions  of that legislation during the months it  has taken the House to debate and con clude its deliberations. What is disturb ing is that the House debate has brought  to light many problems which could well  have changed positions taken by a num ber of my Senate colleagues-particu larly with regard to joint rate surcharge  and cancellation provisions.  I doubt that many of us had any pro found understanding of the consequences  of this provision when it was brought in  as a  last-minute fioor amendment. In  fact, the legislative explanation provided  along with  the amendment  that day  proved to be in many ways inaccurate  and misleading.  It was misleading  in  what it did explain and eloquent in what  it failed to mention at all.  The surcharge and cancellation pro visions we accepted and the modified ver sion passed by  the House will create  chaos in American rail  transportation.  Incredible increases in shipping costs are  inevitable. At best, parts of America can  expect half the service at twice the cost.  In all too many communities, shippers  can look forward to no rail service at all.  The existing network of joint routes  and rates was designed to allow freight  traffic to move from origin to destination  across  the  lines of several connecting  carriers under a single rate-a long haul  rate cheaper than the sum of local rates  to be  transversed. In some cases,  this  simply eliminates the problem of ""you  can't get there from here"" without sep arate quotes from two or more railroads.  In others, it provides competition to the  big railroads whose single line rout.e to  the same destination might otherwise  dominate the market and force a chain  of small railroads out of business.  In reaching ports, it has meant that  through  the  historical  practice  of  equalization, export goods have access  to port facilities and overseas markets  at approximately equal and competitive  rates. The division of  traffic  revenues  which  result  from  the  joint  rate  is  agreed upon by the railroads participat ing in the route.  It is, however, subject to readjustment  at the Interstate Commerce Commission  if one of the rail partners can make a  case th9.t it is not getting a fair or ade quate share. Although this arrangement  has worked effectively for over a cen tury, it will be radically disrupted by the  surcharge and cancellation authority.  Most of my colleagues are now fairly  familiar with this section of the bill, and  I need not describe its technicalities at  length. The formula was developed by  two of the Nation's largest rail transpor tation companies, Conrail and Southern.  It favors inefficient railroads with high  operating costs, and as such,  the sur charge becomes a reward for inefficiency,  providing railroads like Conrail with a  means of enhancing their revenues at  the expense of prosperous carriers and  all shippers.  Conrail has  lobbied  for  its passage  with the threat that without surcharge  authority,  the pricetag on  its annual  congressional bailout will be increasingly  high. Conrail apparently thinks that it  is  about  time American  farmers and  utility customers begin paying for that  railroad's abortive conception and sub sequent mismanagement.  Without  focusing on  the  surcharge  authority authorized by the legislation,  let us  look a  little bit at what results  from cancellation of joint rates, which  the legislation also authorizes.  When a carrier is receiving less than  110 percent of its variable costs on its  portion of a  joint route, it may simply  cancel out the joint rate which has been  published by  the rate bureau-leaving  the shippers to fend for  themselves in  obtaining quotes from the various rail roads whose lines will get the shipper's  goods to market.  With the artful use of selective can cellation, the large railroads will be in a  position to divert traffic to routes from  which they derive the greatest economic  return.  Step  two  naturally  follows wholesale abandonment of those less de sirable joint routes under the stream lined abandonment procedures provided  in other titles of the deregulation bill.  Once competition from  the small rail roads which connect with surcharged or  cancelled routes has been eliminated and  a monopoly  position  established,  the  majority of the Nation's shippers-those  that have any service left at all-will  awaken to find themselves captive to a  single carrier.  The small railroads which presently  provide a competitive option against this  kind of  traffic manipulation are not  equipped to defend against the new op portunities for predatory practices which  are provided by the surcharge and can cellation authority. In an effort to pro vide Conrail with some temporary finan cial relief through rapid redetermination  of its joint rate revenues, the Congress is  risking the bankruptcy of additional car riers and a massive obstruction of market  access by manufacturers in thousands of  communities across the country. In es sence, the legislation will establish a sur charge mechanism which rewards inefti ciency and which sidesteps the real issues  of good management and proper pricing.  These opportunities for anticompeti tive practices have always been curtailed  by the Interstate Commerce Act, which  protects  shippers and  small  railroads  against unjust discrimination and preda tory pricing tactics. But deregulation ex empts both surcharges and selective can cellation of  joint rates from the an.ti discrimination law.  That is just a small dose of what we  are in for once the joint rates section is  ",1980

366,House,96,0.023,1167,19,Mr. RINALDO.," Mr. Chairman, I sup port this amendment to delete provisions  of the bill that require the payment of  a  surcharge on property obtained by  community  health,  education,  public  safety,  and  recreational organizations  under the Federal surplus property do nation program.  Under this program, valuable property  no longer needed by the Federal Govern ment may be obtained by community  service organizations for public purposes.  The property is distributed through des ignated State agencies.  In previous years,  sales of surplus  property not donated to local organiza tions  financed  the donation program.  Last year's appropriations bill, howeve.r,  required  that a  fee be established on  donated property to finance the program  and encourage organizations to exercise  ""self-control"" in requesting donation of  surplus property. A fee of 2 percent of  the value of donated property became  effective on July 7, 1980. It must be paid  by the State distributing agencies and  passed on to local public service organi zations that receive the property.  The cost of packing, crating,  trans porting, and storing already makes  it  necessary for State distribution agencies  to control the amount of property re quested from the Defense Department,  limiting requests to those items for which  there is a bona fide need.  The  surcharge  imposed  under  last  year's bill, which is continued by section  761 of this bill, has drastically increased  the cost of obtaining property through  the donation program. Many State dis tributing agencies have therefore had to  cut back drastically on the amount of  property being requested from the De fense Department. This cut-back in the  State agencies' participation will result  in a  sharp  reduction  in useful  items  available to public service organizations,  and will increase the cost of these items  for non-profit organizations. In addition,  the legality of imposing the surcharge  on State agencies, which do not  take  ownership of the property, is question able, and many State agencies also do  not have clear authority to pay the sur charge. The surcharge provision there fore should be eliminated from the bill.   ",1980
367,House,96,0.204,1167,19,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the amendment by my dis tinguished  colleague  from New York  <Mr. ADDABBO) which would repeal the  Maybank amendment and thus permit  the Department of Defense to target part  of its procurement budget to firms lo cated in labor surplus areas.  Initiated in 1952, Defense manpower  policy No. 4-DMP-4-requires that cer tain procurement contracts be set aside  for bidding in areas of substantial unem ployment. The program was designed to  preserve management  and  employee  skills useful  to  the Nation's defenses  during  times of economic downturns.  However, every Defense appropriations  bill since 1953 has included the language  of Senator Burnet R. Maybank, of South  Carolina,  which  prohibits  following  DMP-4 where the result is a higher price  to the Government. Through this lan guage, Senator Maybank was reportedly  able  to prohibit  the Defense Depart ment from paying more for textiles pro duced in New England mills than would  have to be paid at southern mills.  Originally, the General Services Ad ministration imposed the same Maybank  amendment restrictions on civilian pro curement, for the sake of uniformity in  procurement policies. The GSA revised  DMP-4 so that civilian agencies are no  longer bound by the Maybank amend ment as long as the resulting price of  contracts  targeted  to  labor  surplus- DMP-4-areas is reasonable. Title V of  the Small Business Act amendment- Public Law 95-89 of August 4, 1977specifies  that Governmental  procure ment shall be targeted to high unem ployment areas, and specifically refers to  DMP-4 as the policy to follow.  Yet,  the labor surplus area program  was never allowed to get off the ground.  For the Defense Department to meet the  requirements of DMP-4 and still comply  with  the provisions of  the Maybank  amendment, contracts must be split into  two production runs. One would go out  for nationwide competition to determine  the base price and the other would be  targeted under DMP-4 to a firm in an  area of high unemployment that could  meet this base price. This split produc tion process is cumbersome and confusing  and as a result, has prevented the effec tive implementation of the policy. Tar geting to areas of high unemployment  has been stymied since $60 billion of the  $80 billion budgeted by the Government  for goods and services is spent by the  Defense Department.  Today we have the chance to change  this  situation while bringing Defense  Department procurement practices  in  line with those of other governmental  departments and agencies. The Addabbo  amendment allows the Secretary of De fense  the discretion  to determine that  there is a  reasonable expectation that  offers will be obtained from a sufficient  number of  eligible  concerns  so  that  awards will be made at reasonable prices  in  labor surplus areas. Set-asides  for  labor surplus areas will create private  sector  jobs which, in turn, will reduce  the  local  demand  for welfare,  food  stamps, Comprehensive Education and  ",1980

Many of us  share  fond  memories as we reflect how Aldo pre sented every aspect of a  true spirit of  Illinois.  His accomplishments have been recog nized and rewarded in the field of jour nalism.

373,,96,-0.509,1232,19,Mr. BINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker, there  is a  tendency  these days, especially  among critics of the Carter adminis tration, to portray the last few years  as a time of steady deterioration in the  United States position  in the world.  Indeed, we tend to focus too much on  our headaches, forgetting that the So viets' troubles are more serious.  The erosion of the Soviet position is  well brought out in an article in the  Washington Post of September 10 by  Dusko Doder writing from Moscow:  SOVIETS' GLOBAL POSITION ERODING  While the crisis in Poland is now bringing  into focus internal problems of the Soviet  Bloc, the daily flow of bad news from coun tries along the Soviet borders, ranging from  Norway to Japan, suggests a growing sense  of isolation here as a result of changes in  the balance of forces, especially in Asia.  September 16, 1980  Coming after the deepening morass of Af ghanistan, the Polish turbulence seems to  be a new, major obstacle in the course of  Soviet foreign policy that has successfully  exploited  the  post-Watergate  period  of  American vacillations.  But deeper changes in the strategic equa tion over the last two years-coupled with  new U.S. assertiveness in foreign affairs have renewed fears of ""capitalist encircle ment,"" a notion that party leader Nikita  Khrushchev abandoned more than two dec ades ago when he inaugurated the policy of  ""peaceful coexistence.""  According  to senior Western diplomats,  the two main changes contributing to the  erosion of the Soviet global position involve  the Sino-Japanese  rapprochement  in  the  Far East and the Camp David peace process  that has shut out Moscow from the Middle  East.  The third and unexpected elements is the  revival of Islamic fundamentalism through out Central Asia.  As a result, Moscow sees itself surrounded  by overtly or covertly hostile forces and left  without friends on the vast Asian continent,  with the exception of India and Vietnam.  But even Soviets privately  concede  that  both India and Vietnam draw far greater  benefits  from  these  ties  than does  the  Soviet Union.  Moscow's crucial long-term concern is in  East Asia, where it sees the United States  using China and Japan to create Asian secu rity arrangements  ""based on anti-Soviet ism.""  Japan has entered into this picture as a  result of the Sino-Japan peace and coopera tion treaty signed two years ago. Increased  trade  and  technological  exchanges  since  then have prompted a flurry of articles, in cluding one by Defense Minister Dmitri Us tinov last week, attacking ties between ""the  Chinese hegemonists and Japanese revenge seekers,""  The Soviets had an opportunity to pre vent this course in Sino-Japanese ties had  they been prepared  to  relinquish control  over several  small  islands  in  the Kurile  chain they had seized at the end of World  War  II. The Japanese have made  their  return a precondition for normalization of  relations with Moscow.  The Soviets found it impossible to do so.  However  insignificant  the  island may be,  their return to Japanese sovereignty is seen  here as setting a precedent for a far more  serious  territorial dispute with Moscow's  arch-rivals in Peking.  The Chinese have repeatedly denounced  what they call ""unequal treaties"" imposed  by  the Russian empire on weak Chinese  rulers in the last century. But Chinese terri torial claims in this context are small com pared to their claim on Mongolia, the large  buffer state established by the Soviets in  1924 and for all practical purposes a colony  of Moscow.  Mongolia-which  is  roughly  the size of  Texas, Arizona and California combined was ruled by China from the 17th century  until 1911. Four years later, Csarist Russia  acknowledged in a treaty Chinese sovereign ty  over Mongolia. Subsequently, Chaing Kaishek formally accepted Mongolian inde pendence.  Today,  the Chinese view Mongolia as a  military threat because of the presence of  Soviet land and air forces there.  While they had long studied the implica tion of Japan's rapprochement with China,  the Soviets were unprepared for the Camp  David Peace process that re-established U.S.  positions in the Middle East and effectively  denied Moscow a voice  in  the course of  events there.

374,,96,-0.552,1245,19,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr.  Speaker, this recent editorial from a  newspaper in my district highlights an  important program that helps to place  handicapped individuals in productive  employment. The Cross Agency proj ect of the Industrial Education Coun cil of California has had great success  in placing young people  just out of  high school in jobs in the community.  They, and  the businesses who hire  these youngsters, are to be commend ed. I urge all of my colleagues to look  at the fine example set by this organi zation.  The editorial follows:  ANOTHER COURSE?  To all intents and purposes it was another  agency luncheon--the summer banquet of  the Cross Agency Project of the Industrial  Education Council of California.  There was the name tag to stick on your  lapel--""Hello, my name is ... ""  There was a choice of chicken crepes or  fruit salad with creme de menthe parfait for  desert.  The program listed a welcome, nine speak ers and a slide show with a certificate pres entation at the end.  Midway  into the chicken crepes, one of  those in attendance scanned the speaker list  and remarked, ""I hope they're brief. I have  a 3 p.m. meeting.""  But it turned out to be more than just an other luncheon.  The Cross Agency Project educates, trains  and places young people we have come to  call ""the handicapped.""  They were  there,  these ""handicapped,""  some  in wheelchairs,  some conversing  in  sign language, sharing the crepes and the  CXXVI--1615-Part 19  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  parfaits with those of us we have come to  refer to as the ""more fortunate.""  The hollowness and inadequacy--in fact,  the inaccuracy--of those labels was appar ent from the outset. For those who hadn't  noticed, the first speaker quietly hammered  home the point.  Fifteen-year-old Tami Lucio,  a micro phone before her on her wheelchair, told of  what it meant for her to have a job, to have  work waiting for her to do, to earn a wage,  to be needed every day.  ""I just wish,"" she concluded with the elo quence of those not accustomed to public  speaking, ""that when people looked at me,  they'd see me and not just this wheelchair.""  Some polished speakers  followed Tami,  and  they had worthwhile,  even moving,  things  to say, but  they'd been upstaged  from the start. The whole message had been  conveyed before they ever stepped up to the  microphone.  The director of the Cross Agency Project  is Diane Pedonti. Inside her office at the  project's headquarters  <Suite  160,  2430  Stanwell Drive, Concord>  is a slogan that  sets the tone for this publicly funded under taking. It says:  ""To deny the rights of any person is to  deny our own humanity.""  Fifty-four  students participated  in  the  project this summer. Twenty-nine employ ers received certificates of appreciation at  the luncheon's conclusion.  By that time it was 2:30, and one person's  3 o'clock meeting was in jeopardy. Somehow  that didn't seem as important as it had back  during the chicken crepes.e  MOSCOW, POLAND, AND FINANC ING  OF  COMMUNIST  COUN TRIES BY THE WEST-PART II  HON. LARRY McDONALD  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 16, 1980  Mr. McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, the  recent  announcement  by  President  Carter of the granting of a $670 mil lion loan to Communist Poland in the  form of agricultural credit guarantees,  unfortunately,  is  just the latest in a  series of steps by which the United  States and the free world is assisting  the Communist bloc out of its trou bles. This credit will enable the Soviet  Union to continue to place its empha sis on weapons  production.  It will  assist the Soviet Union in avoiding any  tough decisions concerning  its  rela tions with Poland and will enable Po land's Communist Party  to  remain  firmly  in power. Does anyone  think  the Soviet Union would do us such a  favor? Absolutely not, but it appears  our Government will continue to sell  the rope to hang us with. Just how  helpful we have been to Leonid Brezh nev in this respect is pointed out in  this, part II, of the article that ap peared  in  the Washington Monthly  for June 1980. Part I appeared in the  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD  on Monday,  September 15, 1980 on pages E4339  and E4340.  25683  FINANCING OF SOVIET BLOC BY WESTERN  BANKS Is A MISTAKE--PART II  <By James M. Whitmire>  OUR PARTNER, LEONID  What began as a civilized courtship has  degenerated  into a  shotgun marriage  for  Western banks. COMECON nations have  begun asking that their debts be ""resched uled,"" stretching out repayment timetables  and  effectively  lowering  interest  rates.  Poland, the second-largest and most ""over extended"" of COMECON borrowers <the  Soviet Union holds the most loans, followed  by Poland, East Germany, and Hungary),  has been heavily  rescheduled. Even  if  it  wanted to repay, it lacks the money to do  so. It seems only a matter of time before  other COMECON nations whose seven-year  loans are coming due make the same ""re quest.""  Poland, according to an IMF source, re cently came perilously close to default. It  owes the West $18.5 billion. Debt service on  that amount--or the interest needed to con tinue the loan, without retiring any princi pal--is $4.5 billion. Poland couldn't even  come up with the debt service; the Soviet  Union stepped in and covered $1 billion of  the amount with gold.  In spite of such signs, bankers are willing  to reschedule. The relationship is propelled  by an internal dynamic that makes Western  banks feel obliged to maintain the flow of  loans, even against their better judgment. A  very large debtor has substantial influence  over his creditor, for he can undermine or  even destroy the bank by refusing to pay.  Nearly every major Western bank  is  in volved in a syndicate that is on the hook: so  the entire system, not just individual banks,  is threatened. It recalls the adage, ""Make a  small loan and you have a debtor. Make a  large loan, and you have a partner.""  Banks often take the easy way out and  reschedule loans because they seek to main tain what some disparagingly refer  to as  ""the  illusion of  liquidity."" When a  large  debtor can't or won't repay, banks are un willing to force him into default. As is well  known, banks are in the business of loaning  their deposits <assets>. They are required by  law to keep only about seven percent of the  money they ""have"" on hand for demand withdrawals. The  collapse  of  any  large  debtor  like COMECON would  inevitably  cause depositors  to demand  their money  back, which would drain the federal deposit insurance pools, activate other risk-sharing  syndicates, and spread the chaos further.  This prospect, one expert explains, lends  overriding  importance  to ""preventing na tions from dropping out of the system alto gether."" It is, he says, the ""symbolic effect  of debt repudiation that is most feared.""  As Richards Portes of the University of  London points out, ""If creditors  force  a  country into default, they are in a fundmen tally weak position, because the sanctions  available to them are limited."" Obviously, it  would not be possible  to ""repossess""  the  tractors, computers, grain, and other goods  already shipped to the Soviet bloc. A sher iff's deputy can't serve papers on a factory  in Minsk.  It would seem that, even if he were afraid  to cut his losses and call in existing COME CON paper, a  timid banker would refrain  from making fresh loans. But observers be lieve  the banking community is caught in  the  ""undertow  syndrome,""  swirling  ever  deeper into trouble. Bankers tend to see no  alternative to being sucked under the tide of  more COMECON loans. As far back as 1976,  Financial  Times  reported  that  banks  making uninsured loans to the Soviet bloc  were ""likely to make every effort to contin ue to lend in order to protect the loans, they  ",1980

According to the way I interpret  the budget, there is $1.3 billion more in  this second budget resolution than there  was in the first budget resolution.  In the report on page 9 on national  defense, the second paragraph provides:  The Committee believes that the targets  established for National Defense in the First  Budget Resolution  provided  for  essential  force levels, improved readiness, and modern ization. However, since these targets were es tablished the House has acted to provide sub stantial improvements in milltary pay and  allowances, such as, increases in housing al lowances and improvements in the medical  care program. Consequently, in the Second  Budget Resolution, the Committee is recom mending an increase to cover these changes.  My question is, the $1.3 billion accord ing to this report is for these categories  in national defense and for nothing else.  Is  this a  safe assumption, Mr. Chair man?

381,House,96,-0.123,48,23,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. AUCOIN).  Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Speaker, I believe  this is a better version of the American  Fishery Promotion Act than the one the  ~ouse passed on September 23. I do rise  m support of the bill.  I, too, want to commend the chair man and the ranking minority member  for their able efforts on behalf of this  legislation.  This bill has been  thoroughly dis cussed. It was discussed in September  and most of the Members I  think are  familiar with it. Today I  just want to  comment briefty on two improvements  that were not in the version the House  considered in September and are in the  bill before us today.  First is the restoration of a provision  to extend the title XI loan guarantee  program  to shore-side seafood proces sors. In rece~t years the harvesting sec t?r has received substantial Federal as sis~~nce and has expanded beyond the  ability of our processors to handle the  fish our :fishermen can ca.itch. This is an  unfortunate situation and it has led to  limits being placed on the amount of  fish that our fishermen can sell and to  a disturbing increase in foreign invest ment in and control of our processing  industry.  Extension of the loan guarantee pro gram directly recognizes and addresses  that problem. It will help our processors  to develop and expand. I only regret the  bill does not also include an extension  of the capital construction fund to on shore processors, which would have been  an even more viable piece of assistance  to them. I hope we can act on that in  the 97th Congress.  The other improvement I would like to  note is  the amendment to the Fisher men's Protective Act. This act compen sates fishermen for fishing gear that is  lost or damaged due to foreign fishing  and acts of God. The amendment before  us today further improves this worthy  program by lengthening the filing peri od and providing compensation for lost  income as well as for lost gear.  This  gives  appropriate  recognition  that fishermen need more time to file a  complicated application for a new pro gram and it provides for a level of com pensation closer to the actual economic  losses incurred.  Mr. Speaker, the act before us is, in  my judgment, the most comprehensive  fisheries development bill in the recent  history of the U.S. Congress. Our fishing  industry sorely needs the help the bill  provides. The bill accomplishes all of  these purposes that I have described and  that the chairman and ranking minor ity member have described without r.ny  increased cost to the American taxpayer  by virtue of an inc:rease in foreign fish ing fees.  For all of these reasons, Mr. Speaker,  I urge my colleagues to support and to  pass this bill.  ",1980

Just last week, JACK WYDLER  led the  effort  to preserve  the general revenue  sharing program on  the  floor of  the  House against efforts by some Members  to eliminate it. It was my pleasure and  privilege to support JACK  in that effort  and,  assuming positive action  in  the  Senate, it appears that we may be suc cessful.  I also would like to pay tribue to JACK  WYDLER's efforts  to promote  the de velopment of a safe nuclear power capa bility for the United States. As the rank ing Republican on  the House Energy  and Power Subcommittee for the past 6  years, I know very well how desperately  this Nation will need that safe nuclear  power generation capability in the years  ahead. It is an issue that remains to be  resolved and I regret that JACK will not  be here  in future years  to help us in  that effort.  Mr. Speaker, I  join the many friends  of JACK WYDLER in wishing him well in  his endeavors after leaving the House at  the end of this session. His retirement  is a great loss to the Nation and a very  personal loss for me as well.   o ",1980
383,,96,0.307,100,23,Mr. BELLMON.," Mr. President, in line  with what has been said here this after noon-and  this has been  a very en lightening colloquy for those of us who  have been on both the Budget and Ap propriations Committees. But this whole  problem could be solved-I will not say  easily solved-if we could use the same  functional assignments  in  the Appro priations Subcommittees as we use in the  marking up of the budget which the ad ministration uses in the preparation of  their budget.  We on the Appropriations Committee,  I  think, need to join the 20th century.  We need to go through the subcommit tees and get them in line with the func tions that the executive branch uses and  the Budget Committee uses. Then we will  not have to worry about the crosswalks,  we will not have this business of several  committees dealing with subject matter  that is in one function. That is an enor mous undertaking.  ",1980
384,,96,-0.293,100,23,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, I say  to Senator BELLMON that the fault there in lies with the economists. I think, as a  Senator and as a member of the Appro priations Committee, I think about these  particular functions. But they come along  with function 600, income security, and  any and everything is under there, so cial security, all kinds of payments, trade  adjustment  assistance,  unemployment  compensation, and everything else.  Why do they not list those functions  over in the Office of Management and  Budget the way the Congress does and  let us get our CBO and everything else  and pass a bill and tell them, when they  submit a budget to the President of the  United States, they will submit a budget  that is understandable along with the  Congress.  These committees are not  that  far  apart between the House and Senate-I  mean  the aberration of the Ways and  Means and Finance with respect to the  health functions. But we all know over  here that when you get 050-is that not  grand? What does  that mean? That  means we, as budgeteers, can preen and  prune and dance around like we know  a heck of a lot. We know that part of it  is in energy, and that is the nuclear. We  know parts are under Senator HUDDLES TON with military  construction. And  then parts are under Senator STENNIS  with Defense. That is three of them right  there.  Why do they not say military construc tion? Why do they not say nuclear? Why  ~o they not say Defense, like we are say ing up here, rather than just giving us  an 050 and those kinds of things?  The fault  lies downtown  in  the way  they have been submitting this to us. Be cause they ought to get in step with the  Congress,  in my opinion. We will  be  here. They have a 4-year term. This is a  continuing body.  Mr. DOMENIC!. Well, somebody ought  to get in step with someone.  Mr. President, I  say to Senator HOL am committed to make it  more understandable and more reason able. I  really appreciate the discussion  today, because I  really think, for those  who are on the committee that underLINGS that I  stand, we want  the other committees  to be working with us, we do not want  to be dictating. We want to have some  collegial  activities with  reference  to  changing  this budget process.  I  hope  they do not understand anything we  have said today to be aspersions on any  of the committees. They are acting well  within  their  jurisdiction and certainly  within the purview of the Budget Act.  We  just have to modernize  the whole  setup, including the budget itself.  I  thank the Senator for his observa tions.  ",1980

386,,96,-0.384,126,23,Ms. FERRARO.," Mr. Speaker, in its  report to the President and Congress,  the National Advisory Council on Eco nomic Opportunity projected that in  the  coming  years  the majority  of  America's poor will be women. This so bering fact comes at a time when the  inequities  and  inadequacies  of  the  social security system, and public and  private pensions have become issues of  prime  importance for  this Congress,  and for women across the Nation. As  an active member of both the Con gresswomen's Caucus and the Select  Committee on Aging's task force on  women and social security, I have had  the opportunity  to work  toward  the  resolution of  these  issues. Unfortu nately, the legislative remedies to date  have just scratched the surface.  As an outgrowth of a miniconference  in preparation of  the White House  Conference on Aging, a new grassroots  organization,  the  Older Women's  League <OWL), has been formed. OWL  promises  to  address  the  important  issues of financial security for women.  I would like to commend the organiz ers, whose work on behalf of displaced  homemakers  is  already well-known,  and to call their efforts to the atten tion of my colleagues. I am inserting  in the RECORD an article outlining the  issues facing th~ organization and all  of us who are committed to addressing  the problems of older women. I  look  forward  to working with OWL and  with every member of this body to see  that older women no longer have the  dubious distinction of being America's  fastest growing poverty group.  OLDER WOMEN HAVE A NEW NATIONAL ALLY  (By Sylvia Porter>  The first national grassroots organization  in the U.S. of and for middle-aged and older  women has  just been created-the Older  Women's League <OWL>.  The  pioneering group  came  out of  a  recent meeting in Des Moines among about  400 members of the country's fastest-grow ing minority. While OWL  is not govern ment-sponsored and the conference was not  arranged to promote OWL membership, the  Des Moines mini-conference was set up to  discuss the issues of concern to middle-aged  and older women in preparation for 198l's  White House Conference on Aging.  OWL's concerns are the same-the basic  problems of personal financial survival and  dignity in the older years, notes Tish Som mers, one of the prime movers behind OWL.  No arbitrary age is established as a qualifi cation for membership.  The problems of the older years begin in  middle age and even earlier, Sommers says,  noting some women have been turned down  for apprenticeship programs as too old at  28.  Women 65 and older are not only the fast est-growing segment of our population, but  they also are the single poorest group. Their  average income in 1979 was an almost in credible $59  a week, as against $106 per  week for older men. What's more, the grim  outlook for younger women still at work is  that one out of four of you can look forward  to living in poverty in your older years.  The poverty rate for older women is about  65% higher than for older men. One-third  of all widows live below the poverty line and often live there for a long, long time.  The average age of widowhood in the U.S.  is 56 and more than one of every two women  can expect to be a widow at 65 or later. The  average age of widowhood  is estimated as  extending over 18 years.  ""The critical  situation of hundreds of  thousands of elderly women in this country  is generally overlooked,"" Sommers stresses.  ""As a group  they are  invisible and  their  . plight is masked by statistics that lump to gether all the aged-men, women and cou ples.""  Social Security, with all its built-in inequi ties for women, is the sole source of support  for  large numbers of older women. Their  benefits are well below those paid to men  for  two reasons: 1> Women's earnings are  only about 60% of the earnings of men; and  2)  their wage-related benefits are reduced  still more by their absences from the labor  force while they handle family responsibil ities. Homemaking is not recognized as a le gitimate occupation for the purpose of earn ing Social Security credit.  Fewer than 20% of older women collect  private pension payments either on  their  own or as widows. Those who do are paid  low benefits. On  top of  their  low wages,  women tend to be in the bottom echelon:  part-time or  temporary  jobs not covered  under the pension program. A full half of  all women now working are in jobs with no  pension coverage.  There  also  is  a  provision  called  the  ""widow's blackout""  in most pensions that  denies a survivor's benefit to the spouse of a  worker who dies before ""early retirement  age,"" usually 55. What the husband intend ed  and  expected  for  his widow  simply  doesn't count.  The ""optout"" privilege is another catch in  private pensions. Under most pension plans,  a worker can opt for a reduced pension in  order to provide a survivor's benefit for his  widow. But if he turns down that option,  rarely is the wife notified that she'll get no  pension in case of his death; the news comes  as an ugly shock. Only about 2% of widows  get their husband's pension checks.  The upsurge in costs of all types of shelter  is still another blow, for there are few op tions open  to  impoverished women who  often are thrown out of even the most mar ginal housing. There are  few  emergency  shelters and after  a  short  time on  the  streets, the odds that they'll find a landlord  willing to take them are just about non-exis tent-even if they have the rent.  These-and other issues-will be surfacing  as preparations for next year's White House  Conference on Aging go forward. But as the  organizers of OWL emphasize,  the key to  recognition and action  is getting together  and having a voice. Women can do much  more for themselves than they have in the  past. Sommers hopes there will be an OWL  chapter in every state within a year.e  TRIBUTE TO MOTHER FRANCES  XAVIER CABRINI  HON. GERALDINE A. FERRARO  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 18, 1980  in 1880.  e ",1980
387,,96,-0.658,139,23,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, Nami bia, a black African nation of 1.3 mil lion persons, has been fighting for its  independence from South Africa for  the past 60 years. It is  the world's  third  largest producer of gem  dia monds, and also a leading producer of  uranium. Because of its vast mineral  wealth, Namibia also has fallen under  the  domination  of  European  and  American multinational corporations  which, according to a recent article by  ~r. A. W. Singham in the Nation-OcEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tober  18,  1980-are  relentlessly  ex ploiting  the country's resources and  working behind the scenes to thwart  its independence drive.  For 60 years the people of Namibia  have  been  promised  independence,  first by  the League of Nations and  later by the United Nations. In 1966  and, again, in 1976, the U.N. voted to  end South Africa  rule and ordered  preparations to be made for free elec tions. South Africa has  ignored  the  U.N. mandate and now is engaged in  armed struggle with Namibian nation alist  groups,  principally  the South  West African People's Organization  <SW APO).  Dr. Singham's article, that follows,  reviews the current situation in Nami bia and  the  two-front struggle with  South Africa and  the multinational  corporations in its struggle for  inde pendence. Dr. Singham, formerly pro fessor of political science at Howard  University, is now teaching at Brook lyn College and a consultant to U.N.  agencies.  The article follows:  URANIUM COLONY: THE ILLEGAL  EXPLOITATION OF NAMIBIA  <By A. W. Singham)    Namibia possesses a considerable nest egg  in the form of mineral wealth which could  have given it a solid start in life a.s an inde pendent nation. Instead, these riches-ura nium primarily, but also diamonds,  zinc,  copper and possibly oil-have made South  Africa all the more determined to continue  its  illegal  possession.  For Namibia  has  become a target of exploitation by some of  the world's largest  transnational corpora tions, contrary to specific prohibitions in a  United Nations decree.  In collusion with  South Africa, and with the tacit blessing of  their own governments, these multination als are preventing Namibia from fulfilling  the independent destiny envisioned for it by  the United Nations.  The  intransigence of South Africa has  been abundantly clear in the delaying tac tics it has employed to forestall free elec tions in Namibia and gain legitimacy for its  own puppet regime. It was most recently  evinced  in a  letter dated August 29  from  Pieter Willem Botha, South African Prime  Minister,  to U.N. Secretary General Kurt  Waldheim,  informing him in no uncertain  terms that South Africa would not allow the  United Nations to supervise elections in Na mibia and seriously questioning the integri ty of the Secretary General and the entire  United Nations family. The South African  Prime Minister was possibly buoyed by the  statement of a Ronald Reagan adviser  in  Pretoria recently that a Reagan administra tion would adopt a new policy toward the  republic. South Africa is banking its hopes  on the possible election of Reagan in the  United States and the continuing support of  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Brit ain  to  underwrite  the  continuity of  its  apartheid regime and its domination of Na mibia. Botha's letter should destroy any il lusions  the Western  nations  have  that  South African  policy  can  be  changed  through their good offices.  The scope of foreign mining operations in  Namibia  is especially alarming because of  the  brazen  violation  of United Nations  decree No. 1 for the Protection of the Natu ral Resources of Namibia, which was adopt ed by the Council for Namibia on Septem ber 27, 1974, and by  the United Nations  General Assembly on December 13, 1974.  30137  The decree forbids persons or corporations  to ""take, extract, mine, process, refine, use,  sell, export, or distribute any natural re source, whether animal or mineral, situated  or found to be situated within the territorial  limits of Namibia"" without the consent of  the U.N. Council for Namibia, on pain of  ""seizure and forfeiture"" by the council or its  representative.  Namibia, it should be recalled, has been  the responsibility of the international com munity for the past sixty years, ever since  the League of Nations, in May 1919, ordered  South Africa to protect the territory and  prepare its people for independence. South  Africa flouted this mandate, and in October  1966  the U.N. General Assembly passed a  resolution terminating South Africa's con trol and appointed a Council for Namibia to  administer  the  area  until  independence.  After thirteen years, this council is still not  recognized by South Africa, which contin ues to defy openly the decision of the world  community. The General Assembly eventu ally recognized the organization known as  SW APO <South West African People's Or ganization) as the legitimate and authorita tive  spokesman  for  the Namibian people  and  insisted  that South Africa negotiate  with it. The Security Council also author ized the Secretary General to establish an  elaborate machinery  to hold elections  in  that territory. But South Africa conducted  fraudulent  elections whose  results  have  never been accepted by  the  international  community.  Testimony before the Council for Namibia  this summer provided further insights into  the real motives of South Africa and other  Western powers. It was revealed that Nami bia's economy is now dominated by white,  foreign-owned  interests,  based  largely  in  South Africa,  the United Kingdom,  the  United States, France, West Germany, the  Netherlands and Canada. They are involved  in the exploitation of its natural resources,  especially in the mining of mineral deposits.  Experts from around the world documented  the enormous scope of uranium mining. The  territory holds some of the largest uranium  reserves in the world, which, if fully devel oped, would make Namibia the third largest  producer  of  uranium,  after  the United  States and Canada. Namibian uranium  is  being extracted, processed, transported and  sold, in violation of U.N. Decree No. 1, by  transnational corporations with the support  of their respective governments and the col lusion of the government of South Africa.  The main uranium mine in Namibia is oper ated by Rossing Uranium Ltd. Last year, it  nearly reached its full production capacity  of 4,535 metric tons of uranium oxide per  annum.  The rights to develop the Rossing mine  were acquired by the British-based transna tional Rio Tinto Zinc <see following article).  Rio Tinto Zinc now owns almost half the  mine, which in 1979 earned nearly $200 mil lion from exports of uranium oxide. Other  large shares in the mine are held by a Cana dian  subsidiary  of Rio Tinto Zinc, Rio  Algom, and a French subsidiary, Total. In  addition, the largely South African Anglo American  Corporation, America's Union  Carbide and West Germany's Urangesell schaft have been involved in extensive pro specting  for uranium  in Namibia. Other  transnationals have invested in South Afri ca's  electrical  and  technical  industries,  which utilize Namibian uranium. For exam ple, Allis-Chalmers, which helped to develop  the Oak Ridge reactor, is the major contrac tor for the construction of the first nuclear  reactor for the South African Fundamental  Research Reactor.

389,,96,-0.247,191,23,Mr. RANDOLPH.," Mr. President, I join  my able colleague from North Dakota  <Mr. BURDICK)  in supporting the passage  of  this  legislation  to amend  the Safe  Drinking Water Act.  H.R. 8117 was referred to the Senate  Committee on Environment and Public  Works on September 24 of this year. It  will primarily extend the length of time  in which States can  exempt  certain  drinking water systems  from  the ap proaching January 1, 1981, deadline for  compliance with  the  interim national  primary drinking water regulations.  Over the past year, I have been made  acutely aware of the problems that many  systems, particularly those in small com munities, have had  in trying to reach  this deadline. I have heard my colleagues  from Iowa, Illinois, South Carolina, and  other States tell me many water systems,  especially the ones in small communities,  desperately need additional time to ac complish the goals set forth by the Fed eral standards. West Virginia communi ties also need a delay in the deadline.  Many small communities are making  good progress. But also, in order for the  real  intent of  the  law  to be attained,  additional  time  is necessary for  those  who are still seeking the resources to up grade their systems. The measure before  us would enable the States to grant ex emptions on a case-by-case basis until  January 1, 1984.  A second significant provision of this  measure would exempt natural gas stor age wells from  the statutory definition  of underground  injection. There  is no  evidence at this time that underground  natural gas storage poses a hazard  to  underground sources of drinking water.  This section of  the bill will effectively  delete the practice of storing natural gas  from the underground injection control  program regulations.  A  third provision of  the  legislation  facilitates State underground injection  control programs for oil and gas opera tions. Under present law, State programs  must satisfy Environmental Protection  Agency regulations before they can as sume primary enforcement responsibil ity. This portion of the bill would grant  the States this primary authority, pro vided they can show that their programs  satisfy the requirements established by  the Safe Drinking Water Act.  We have evolved a reasonable compro mise to many bills that have been intro duced  this session. This bill addresses  several  important  issues  in a  sensible  fashion. I endorse it with my vote today.   Mr. DOMENIC!. Mr. President, I rise  in support of H.R. 8117, a bill to amend  the Safe Drinking Water Act. That act  has created a number of problems in my  State of New Mexico and this bill will  resolve many of  those problems. Spe cifically, I would like to address two sec tions of the bill.  The Safe Drinking Water Act requires  that  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency propose regulations for the State  underground injection control proo-ram  within 120 days after the date of e~act­ ment of that law. The regulations would  cover all  types of injection wells from  industrial and nuclear disposal wells, oil  and gas injection wells, solution mining  wells or any hole in the ground designed  for  the purpose of  injecting water or  other fluids below the surface.  Since this section was passed into law,  EPA has proposed and reproposed regu lations, and in each case, the proposals  have been almost universally disliked by  the State who will enforce those regula tions.  For example,  in my State of New  Mexico,  the State oil conservation di vision presently regulates approximately  3,500  injection wells related to oil and  gas activities in the State. These include  injection wells  in  secondary  recovery  projects  and  approximately  250  salt  water disposal wells. Almost 80 percent  of the State's oil production is directly  related to the continued use of these in jection wells, consequently, EPA's regu lations are of vital concern, and un necessary  regulations  imposed on  an  already effective State program could be  a step backward, not a step forward.  In New Mexico  the first salt water  disposal well was approved in 1951. The  oil conservation division has continued  to work to develop a program which it  believes  adequately  protects  under ground sources of drinking water while  continuing to permit the maximum de gree of oil and gas production at a  minimum cost to taxpayers. Since that  first well was approved in 1951, there has  only been one case brought before the  Commission where contamination of a  fresh water zone was alleged.  The Interstate Oil Compact Commis sion has prepared a brief study of the  harmful effects of oil and gas operations  on  underground  sources  of  drinking  water in the States of Texas, New Mex ico, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas  and has failed  to find any widespread  contamination. While  the study  is by  no means a comprehensive look at the  issue, it is presently the only information  of this kind available, as EPA has not  as yet conducted such a study.  The imposition of a rigid national pat tern on States which possess varying  regulatory systems, varying geology, and  varying ages of wells, could prove un workable. The Safe Drinking Water Act  requires  that EPA  not  unnecessarily  interfere with existing State programs,  but it is my belief that the issuance of  these  underground  injection  control  regulations  could  undermine  the  re sponsible programs of many States.  H.R. 8117 will give EPA the discretion  to approve State plans, without subject ing those States to regulations prepared  under the Safe Drinking Water Act, if  the State program adequately protects  underground water supplies. It is my be lief that this is a fair and equitable solu tion to the problem.  The bill also addresses  the problem  of communities that have not been able  to meet interim primary drinking stand ards. Specifically, it extends  the State  exemption authority for compliance with  interim standards from January 1, 1981  until January 1, 1984.  Mr. President,  this amendment will  greatly assist many small communities  in my State of New Mexico, as well as  small communities all over this country.  States should have the ability to continue  to exempt systems from compliance with  interim regulations until final standards  are issued. This amendment will serve  that need.  Therefore, Mr. President, I urge im mediate acceptance of H.R. 8117.e  e ",1980
390,,96,0.099,191,23,Mr. PERCY.," The need for  this  legislation is manifest.  Unless  this  legislation  is passed  this  session, Mr. President, some 60 water  systems in my State of South Carolina  will  be out of compliance with Safe  Drinking Water Act  standards  as  of  January 1. To keep from being out of  compliance,  these systems would have  to undergo an extremely costly modifica tion process to remove fluorides from the  water.  The Environmental Protection Agency  h'as not yet  completed  the necessary  studies from which to establish appropri ate fluoride  level standards, and until  this is done, I feel that it would be pre mature to set exacting standards. I hope  that prompt action can be taken today,  Mr. President, so that hundreds of com munities  in South Carolina and other  States will not have to undertake sub stantial modifications of their water sys tems which may ultimately prove to have  been unnecessary.

393,House,96,-0.385,230,23,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the amendment.  I would  like  to point out that this  amendment is not directed at youth who  have committed criminal acts, rather it  is intended to permit the incarceration  of children known as status offenders.  By  dcftnttion,  status  offenders  are  . children whose actions would not be  criminal  if  committed  by  an  adult.  Status offenders are children with social  and adjustment problems including in corrigibility, waywardness,  and  those  who run away or are truant. Also  in cluded in this category are nonoffenders  such  as  dependent  and  neglected  children.  The purpose of the Juvenile Justice  and Delinquency Prevention Act  is  to  prevent and reduce  the occurrence of  juvenile delinquency. Since  its enact ment in 1974, the cornerstone of this leg islation has been the requirement that  States which voluntarily participate in  the program agree to remove from secure  detention  and  correctional  facilities,  those juveniles who are charged with or  who have committed offenses that would  not be criminal if committed by an adult,  as well  as  dependent  and  neglected  children. For 6 years this has been the  law and during this time the annual in crease  in  juvenile crime has dropped  from 15 to 1 percent. The fact that only  seven of the eligible  jurisdictions have  chosen not to participate in this volun tary program indicates the value of al ternatives for helping to prevent juve nile delinquency.  The Congress prohibited  the secure  confinement of status offenders in light  of the overwhelming evidence that plac  ing nonoffender  children with delin quent youth does not address the child's  problems, and instead, significantly in creases the likelihood that the child will  commit a criminal act in the future.  However,  in spite of  this  fact,  the  proposed  amendment  would  permit  status offenders to be placed in the one  setting where they will not receive need ed treatment and where they will come  in contact with serious offenders who  can provide them with vocational train ing in such skills as prostitution, nar cotics peddling, and other criminal ac tivities.  For  status-offenders,  secure  lockup  facilities  can  truly be  called  schools for crime.  The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention Act provides financial assist ance to enhance prevention and treat ment programs designed  to meet  the  specific needs of noncriminal youth in  participating States. Alternatives already  available to judges for these youth in clude  foster care,  shelter-care homes,  group homes, day treatment, home proto  bation, and other designated community based, diagnostic, treatment, or rehabili tation services.  H.R. 6704 does not ignore the fact that  chronic status offenders deserve special  attention. Title III of  this  legislation  authorizes  funding  for  demonstration  projects to develop special programs to  assist with chronic runaways, including  those who run from treatment facilities  where  they have been placed by  the  court.  Judges should use their expertise and  knowledge  to provide placements and  treatments that will help a child over come his or her problems and prevent  that child from advancing from non criminal  to criminal activities.  Incar ceration is difficult to justify as either  a treatment or a punishment. Status of fenders  rarely  receive counseling  that  meets their specific emotional and men tal health needs while institutionalized.  Indeed, secure incarceration masquerad ing as rehabilitation serves only to in crease our already critical crime rate by  providing new students for what have  become  institutionalized  schools  for  crime. If status offenders are incarcer ated for punishment purposes, institu tionalization punishes  the  less serious  off ender  more  than  the  criminal  offender.  The availability of alternatives as pro vided under H.R. 6704 greatly enhance  the options available  juvenile court  judges  for  rehabilitation without  the  harmful stigmatization that can accom pany contact with the criminal justice  system. The fact that a youth runs away  from a  treatment facility, rather than  demonstrating any intentional affront to  the court's authority, is merely sympto matic of the very problems for which  shelter care was originally provided.  If adopted,  this  amendment would  permit us  to  lapse back  to  the  lazY  method of confinement rather than try ing to deal with a child's problems in a  positive manner. I do not believe my col leagues in the House of Representatives  wish to change a  law that has been in  existence since 1974 to allow court orders  which provide  criminal  sanctions  for  noncriminal activities. Such court orders  are  particularly  troublesome  because  status offenders do not enjoy many of  the due process guarantees and protec tions that are a1f orded to delinquents.  The evidence which lead the Congress  to enact the original deinstitutionaliza tion provisions of the Juvenile Justice  and Delinquency Prevention Act are as  compelling today as they were in 1974.  I urge my colleagues  to def eat this  amendment.  ",1980

397,,96,-0.171,321,23,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to  insert my Washington  report for Wednesday, November 19,  1980, into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:  A FEW IMPRESSIONS OF THE ELECTION  As soon as an election ends, the interpre tation of the results begins. For what it is  worth, this politician adds a few impressions  of his own.  The 1980 election gave the country the  strongest turn to the right in a generation.  The major question is whether it signifies as  well the beginning of a new era of conserva tism. One election does not mark a funda mental realinement of political power. Such  a realinement will probably hinge on wheth er the Republicans successfully implement  their polici~ and achieve their goals, princi pally their economic ones.  It may be that the election was a broad  mandate for a particular ideology or social  agenda, but it is still too early to be certain  because the election was also a repudiation  of the Carter record. Everywhere I went, I  encountered confusion about the direction  of President Carter's leadership and doubt  about his competence. The 1980 results were  uniquely tied to Mr. Carter's economic per formance. Public dissatisfaction with  the  economy surely hurt him more  than any  other single  issue. Voters were also  con cerned  about America's posture  in  the  world.  They wanted  a  tougher  foreign  policy, especially in dealing with the Soviet  Union.  In  short, voters had  a  sense  of  American impotence' abroad and deep frus tration with  the economy at home. They  were demanding better economic and inter national  initiatives.  In a way, Mr. Carter  lost the election even more than Governor  Reagan won it.  My sense is that the people were voting on  a pragmatic, rather than ideological, basis.  The explanation most frequently cited  to  me for a vote for Mr. Reagan and the Re publicans was  simply:  time  for  a  change."" Voters were  rebelling against a  government out of control, against decades  of  federal programs  that had become so  complex-and to many voters, at least, so ri diculous-that the time had come to call a  halt. Repeatedly, voters  said  to me  that  they felt grand federal ideas to help people  had gone awry by the time they reached the  local communities. Whether it was the auto""It is  30319  mobile mechanic disengaging an em1ss10n control device, or the older person with crip pled hands who could not open the child proof drug container mandated by Washing ton, or the workers breathing clean air as  they walked by the closed steel mill, voters  had had enough. In the 1980 election more  than  in most elections,  the people were  saying to us that they wanted real changes  in policy. They were saying to us: ""Come up  with some new ideas.""  In retrospect, I am a  little amazed that  the election was as close as it apparently  was until  the final 48 hours. In the end,  however,  the  election  became what  the  Carter camp did not want it to become: a  referendum on unhappiness. Even though  Mr. Carter had sought a debate with Mr.  Reagan throughout the campaign, and even  though  the debate was a  critical  turning  point for Mr. Reagan, the seeds of Mr. Cart er's defeat were sown  long before  in his  staff problems, his difficult relations with  Congress,  the American hostages  in  Iran,  Congressman Anderson's independent chal lenge, the hard-fought primary against Sen ator Kennedy, and the gasoline lines.  Mr. Reagan must be given much credit,  too. Throughout  the campaign he main tained his good disposition, even his humor.  He did not follow  the path of ideological  purity, but enlarged his base by supporting  federal assistance for Chrysler, New York  City, and the farmers. Mr. Reagan sounded  the theme for his campaign with the telling  question: ""Are you better off now than you  were four years ago?"" It was a lethal way of  pointing out Mr. Carter's failures.  For me, and perhaps for most of the coun try, the election was a shock. I had expected  a close election. Indeed, I was prepared to  wait until Wednesday morning for the an nouncement of a winner. Mr. Carter not  only lost the popular vote by 51 per cent to  41 per cent and the electoral college vote by  a staggering 489  to 49, but his party suf fered  its worst defeat  years. The  Reagan sweep was wide and deep. It pene trated right down to the level of the county  court house. Mr. Reagan carried every sec tion of  the country,  reversing  the  trend  toward  ticket-splitting that had character ized  recent presidential elections. He dis membered  the  old Democratic  coalition,  winning  the Jewish, ethnic, Catholic, and  blue-collar voters, all of whom had been tra ditionally Democratic.  The Republicans picked up four governor ships,  reducing  the Democrats' previous  dominance to 27-23. They also made signifi cant gains in state legislatures, with the net  addition of 189 seats across  the country.  The Republicans now have  the effective  lever of the veto in the redistricting process  in 32 states because they control at least  one house of the legislature or the gover nor's office in those states. In Congress, the  Republicans gained half of the 59 seats they  needed  to win  a majority  in  the House.  Moreover, they took control of the Senate,  53-47, with 15 new members. The terms of  20 Democrats  and  only  12 Republicans  expire in the Senate in 1982, giving the Re publicans a chance to strengthen their hold  on that body.  So the future looks bright for the Repub licans. They emerge from the election uni fied; the Democratic Party is wounded and  splintered. The election creates a splendid  opportunity for the Republicans to fashion  a lasting majority based on performance in  office. They have won big, but the report  card on  their performance will  come  in  in 28  fast.e  ",1980

JACK MURPHY, JACK WYDLER, BoB Mc EWEN, LESTER WOLFF, LIZ HOLTZMAN, and  JERRY AMBRo have been more than just  fellow Members. They have been friends,  sources of counsel and teammates. The  good of the people of New York State  and of the Nation always has been their  top priority, and always has been  the  prime motivator of their actions.  With regard to the New York delega tion as a whole, I have often remarked  that one of the choicest rewards of serv ice in the Congress is the ability it pro vides to associate with, work with, and  better yet, develop friendships with some  of the finest people in the world. Cer tainly,  into that category I place each  member of this delegation. Although our  association in this sense will soon termi nate, our friendships will indeed endure  forever.  Countless memories of our association  flash  through my mind as I  look back  over my 16 years in this body, and it  would be impossible to verbalize all of the  meaningful,  rewarding, and enjoyable  experiences we have shared.  I will not say goodby for this is just  the end of one chapter and the beginning  of another. I will deeply miss service in  the Congress, as I know my fellow re tirees will. But I know we all look to the  challenges ahead, to working together in  new endeavors, and continuing in the  spirit which has guided us in our daily  quest  to better the lives of our fell ow  citizens.   e ",1980
402,,96,-0.339,490,23,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, in recent  days, much attention has been focused  on some proposed policy recommenda tions  involving  the  social  security  system  advanced  by President-elect  Reagan's special social security  task  force. Included among these ideas are  raising the social security retirement  age from 65  to 68 and recalculating  annual cost-of-living increases on the  basis of wage  increases not price  in creases.  As an original member of the House  Select Committee on Aging, I consider  it absolutely essential that all of these  proposals be subjected to the closest  possible scrutiny before they are ad vanced as  legislation. I believe a na tional dialog involving the new admin istration, the Congress and the Ameri can  people,  especially  the  elderly,  must be started to realistically discuss  the  future  of  the  social  security  system.  I am somewhat concerned over the  general direction which the task force  recommendations seem to be  taking.  The concern about the future finan cial viability of  the system  is some thing which I share. However,  I be lieve that achieving savings solely. by  reducing or delaying earned benefits is  not sound policy.  If we are to realistically discuss the  future funding of the social security  system, we must include in these dis cussions proposals to provide for par tial general revenue financing of the  system. In the next Congress  I will  sponsor legislation, once authored by  our  distinguished  former  colleague  James Burke, to provide that social se curity be financed one-third employer,  one-third  employee,  and  one-third  general revenue.  As we consider different options for  the future, we must remember that  almost 30 percent of older Americans  rely on social security as their source  of  income. For more  than 40 years,  social security has represented a cov enant between millions of Americans  and  their Government,  a  covenant  based on mutual participation  and  trust. The worker contributes to the  system thus helping to provide benefits  for  eligible  recipients and ultiEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  mately  their  own  retirement. The  Government's  responsibility  is  to  insure and protect the system so that  benefits earned by workers  can be  benefits drawn by retirees.  The world of 1980  is far different  than it was when social security went  into  eff eCt.  Dramatic  demographic  shifts  have  occurred  to  the  point  today that in this century that rate of  growth among persons 60 and over is  four times that of people under 60. In  1980, for the first time in our history,  the number of persons over 60 exceeds  the number of persons under 10. This  shift in population is felt more in the  social security system than in many  other programs. The system's ability  to provide benefits is directly tied to  the number of younger workers con tributing  into  the system, and  their  numbers are on the decline while the  number of recipients is on the rise.  I applaud the interest being shown  by the President-elect in the future of  the social security system and hope to  work closely with him in the months  ahead.e  EDDIE PATTEN  HON. EDWIN B.

403,,96,0.377,490,23,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, we  often  hear  complaints  about  how  agencies  abuse  their  regulatory  powers.  Sometimes when we  read  these incidents in the newspaper, or  hear about  them on  television, we  simply cannot believe just how absurd  these regulations are. But these inci dents of overregulation just keep oc curring.  It is  time  stop.  Recently, one of the folks from back  home in Atlanta sent me a copy of a  commentary  by Neal  Boortz. Mr.  Boortz works at WLTA-FM in Atlanta,  and  is well known for his commen taries on the state of our Government.  I would like to share his remarks with  you.  this abuse was put to a  THE NEAL BOORTZ COMMENTARY  How many of you have said, after one of  my attacks on the incompetency in Govern ment, ""Oh, there goes ole Neal again, just  piling the bad words on our Government.  Nobody, not even a bureaucrat, could be  that simple minded.""  Wait a minute-try this story on for size.  At a California construction site last week  there was  a cave  in  . . . One man was  trapped and his life in danger. The fire de partment was called  to dig him out, and  they did. It took over 2 hours, with the fire men  literally standing on  their heads at  times. The man's life was saved. Well, did  the firemen return to a heroes welcome? Not  quite. An OSHA inspector read the story of  the rescue in the paper, hurried over to the  site,  investigated  the details of  the oper ation, and promptly filed charges against  the firemen for conducting the rescue in an  unsafe and unapproved manner. Now, do I  need the rest of my time to make this point?  According to OSHA, heroism can be harm ful to your health and you need a bureau crat to protect you from it. Well, there was  some unpleasant publicity in the local press  and I'm happy to report, an OSHA superior  decided to withdraw the charges-but even  he defended  the  inspector's diligence  in  filing the charges in the first place.

I support passage  of the simple extension that is before  the House and agree  that  the new  President should have  a  chance  to  make his own proposals. But some of  the unfinished work cannot wait for ever.  As  you  know, Mr.  Speaker,  the  Banking Committee played a  signifi cant role in shaping what is known as  title II of the expanded program of  the Economic Development Adminis tration in the legislation that finally  failed in conference. This is the title  involved with  credit  assistance  for  business-direct loans, loan guarantees  and interest subsidies-and it encom passed  the major  innovation  in  the  legislation. As a  conferee,  I worked  with my colleagues from  the Public  Works Committee to achieve compro mise solutions for some of the points  in dispute with the Senate in this title,  and in fact, we reached almost com plete agreement.  The underlying  thrust of  the new  legislation was that the best solution  for the Nation's distressed communi ties, whether rural or urban, is the cre ation of permanent private sector jobs.  While I originally favored a somewhat  different approach  in the form of a  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  national development bank, I believe  the expanded EDA program held out  great promise in achieving that pur pose. It is a purpose that it is not at  odds with the philosophy of the  in coming President, Mr. Reagan.  I do not know, of course, what Mr.  Reagan will be proposing in this broad  area of helping distressed areas apart  from his endorsement of enterpri.se  zones, which  is an approach mainly  through special forms of tax relief for  business  locating  in  the designated  places. I believe the new administra tion will find that credit assistance is  also essential as a tool for the job cre ation we all want.  In any case, EDA will continue  to  exist and, for the time being, it is the  only tool we have. But as those of us  who helped develop the proposed new  program  are  acutely  aware, EDA's  present  legislation  is  far  from  ade quate. Even apart from  the  issue of  whether its authority to make loans  and loan guarantees for businesses in vesting in distressed cities and towns  should be expanded, its existing loan  guarantee program is seriously ham pered by the lack of legislative author ity  to develop a working secondary  market for this paper. Without a sec ondary market, there is little chance  of a vigorous program with active par ticipation of the commercial banks.  Mr. Speaker, I will not be here next  year, but I would like to express the  hope  that  the Banking and Public  Works Committees will get  to work  early in the new session to modify title  II in directions that were fully agreed  upon in the recent Senate-House con ference, particularly to make possible  a  secondary market. This should be  largely noncontroversial and does not  get into the issue of whether the EDA  program should be greatly expanded  or what the basic urban policy should  be. It appears now that a loan guaran tee program of $425 million will be ap proved in the appropriations bill for  1981, and this is large enough to make  a good start if the present obstacles  are removed.

These dedi cated servants  leave the comforts of  the United States and suffer untold  hardships to deliver God's word in for eign lands and to off er assistance to  those in need. Our missionaries abroad  deserve our support and backing; yet  our  tax code penalizes  these brave  Americans. Instead of being offered a  merited  tax exemption  for  their ef forts as good will ambassadors, Ameri can foreign missionaries are not only  taxed by their own Government, but  also often find  themselves  taxed by  the country in which they are serving.

I  urge my colleagues in the Senate to do  likewise,  and  pass  this  legislation  promptly.  I wish to enter the text of a letter  from the Rev. Hal F.

There is one form of ""double taxation,""  however,  that doesn't seem so complex.  I  refer to the matter of foreign missionaries  being taxed by the country in which they  live and an effort by the U.S. government to  tax the same missionaries.  I  encourage  you  to  stand up  for  the  $20,000 tax exemption now being sought for  foreign missionaries-or else work at keep ing them from paying taxes in the country  where they are serving.e  TRIBUTE TO DEPARTING  COLLEAGUES  HON.

They  have all served with dedication, and  their experience and  leadership will  certainly be missed by us all.  Since  1962,  JOHN M. MURPHY  of  Staten  Island  has  represented  the  17th District with pride,  just as he  fought for his country in the Korean  war. His military  service  record  is  highlighted by the Distinguished Serv ice Cross, the Purple Heart, and the  Bronze Star.  His congressional career was high lighted with his chairmanship of the  Committee on Merchant Marine and  Fisheries.  30865  JOHN MURPHY can be proud of his  record, and he will be missed by this  body.  JOHN W. WYDLER has  represented  New York's Fifth District since 1962,  and his constituents in Nassau County  have always received close attention to  local matters,  an  aspect of  service  JOHN WYDLER was noted for.  His  positions on  the Government  Operations Committee, and  the Sci ence and Technology Committee, won  him the respect and praise of his col leagues, Democrats and Republicans  alike. His absence will create a void,  but we  all  can be pleased  to have  served with him.  JAMES M. HANLEY has distinguished  himself in this body as chairman of  the House Committee on Post Office  and Civil Service, and he has worked  diligently to be bring stability to both  of these aspects of our Government.  In 1964, he came to Congress with a  long  list of civic  achievements. His  congressional achievements are just as  impressive.  JAMES HANLEY's position of  leader ship will be  filled  in  the next Con gress, but his leadership qualities will  be hard to replace.  After serving 10 years  in the New  York State senate, ROBERT McEWEN  came to Congress from the 30th Dis trict. His district covered  the north ernmost regions of New York State,  but his service to his c'onstituents re mained close and valued.  As a member of the Committee on  Appropriations, he advocated fiscal re sponsibility, a  trademark that will be  desired in the next Congress.  As chairman of  the Subcommittee  on Asia and Pacific Affairs, LESTER  WOLFF of New York's Sixth District,  played an important role in the open ing of trade negotiations with China  and trade with Japan. His interest in  foreign affairs made him a  forceful  voice on the issue and respected by his  colleagues.  Since 1964, LESTER WOLFF has repre sented his varied district with distinc tion. His presence will be missed  in  Congress and back home.  ELIZABETH  HOLTZMAN  defeated  a  legend to come to Congress from the  16th District of New York. In her 8  years of service, she made a name for  herself in a number of areas.  From Watergate to women's rights,  Congresswoman HOLTZMAN was in the  fight,  for her country and her con stituency. She was a leader, and still is  today, even though she will be leaving  this House.  JEROME AMBRO has had a long career  of public  service.  It was capped  in  1974, with his election  to Congress  from New York's Third District. As a  member  of  the Public Works  and  Transportation Committee, we served  together.

This amendment insures that the eco nomic burden imp0sed on the zinc in d~stry is reasonable, both from an en vironmental and economic standpoint  thereby. avoiding  further unwarranted  economic da.mage to this ailing industry.

It is my hope that this minor adjust ment in the fee structure will provide  modest relief for the ailing domestic zinc  industry. As an  indication of the dire  strait  in which this industry finds it self, within the past year the closure of  two zinc smelters-St. Joe's Monaca, Pa.,  plant in December 1979, and New Jersey  Zinc's Palmerton, Pa., plant in August  1980-resulted in the loss of 43 percent  of  the Nation's zinc metal production  capacity, over 2,000 jobs, and a worsen ing of the balance-of-payments situa tion.  As further evidence of the justification  for  this amendment, I ask unanimous  consent to have prihted in the RECORD  the following materials prepared by st.  Joe Minerals Corp.:  Zinc Metal  Exhibit 1-The Declining American Zinc  Industry;  Exhibit 2-U.S.  Capacity;  Exhibit 3--Crltlque o! ""Fees on Zinc"";  Exhibit 4-Description of Zinc Sulfate and  Zinc Chloride; and  Exhibit 5-Impact of Exempting Zinc and  Zinc Oxide.  Production  There being no objection,  the ma terials were ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  EXHIBIT 1.-THE DECLINING AMERICAN  ZINC INDUSTRY  Zinc  ls a vital material, as evidenced by  the Government's current stockpile  target  of 1,425,000 tons. Its main uses are in galvan izing, to protect steel from corrosion, in die  castings  (where usage has been declining  because o! their decreased use in automo biles) and in brass. In tonnage iterms zinc ls  the fourth most important metal, after steel,  aluminum and copper. Below ls a brief re view o! what has happened to the American  zinc industry over the last decade:  1. Ten years ago, the United States pro duced over 1 mllllon tons of zinc metal a  year. It now produces just hal! that amount,  about 500,000 tons a year.  2. Meanwhile, overseas zinc metal produc tion has Increased by 25 percent in the 196978 period, as new smelters, mainly in Europe  and Japan, have been constructed.  3. A decade ago this country was dependent  on foreign sources for 20-25 percent of its  zinc metal;  now,  it  ls 50 percent  import  dependent.  4. Eleven U.S.  zinc  smelters have been  dosed since 1969. Only one, a small plant,  has been replaced by a modern plant, also  small; one new pl!l.nt was opened last year;  and one was re-opened but at drastically re duced capacity. In 1969 this country had 14  zinc smelters;  in August 1980 it had six.  5. In the last year alone, the closure of two  zinc sme!.ters  (St. Joe's Monaca, Pa., plant  ln December 1979, and New Jersey Zinc's,  Palmerton, Pa., plant  in August 1980)  re sulted in the loss of 43 percent of this coun try's zinc metal production capacity, about  2,200 jobs and a further drain on the nation's  trade balance of, perhaps, $150-200 mlllion  a year. St. Joe recently announced a partial  reopening of its Monaca smelter at about  ~ of rated capacity.  6. U.S. producers are currently quoting  39.5¢ /lb. for zinc metal. In 1975-a recession  year-prices were 39¢ /lb.  7. Today's zinc metal price is only slightly  more than in 1977  (35¢/lb.). In 1977, U.S.  zinc producers collectively suffered a beforetax loss despite a 20 percent increase in con sumption over 1975 levels.

EXHIBIT 3-CRITIQUE OF ""FEES ON ZINC""  Attached is a detailed critique o! an EPA  document, ""Fees on Zinc,"" which has been  cited as justification for imposing Superfund  fees on zinc.  The document represents a strained effort  on EPA's part to trump up a case against  zinc in the absence of any convincing data.  One can only wonder if the ""data"" support ing  the  inclusion  of  other materials  in  Superfund is equally superficial.  First, the document incriminates zinc by  listing a number of statutes and regulations  in which zinc is listed as a hazardous sub stance. In truth, neither zinc metal nor zinc  oxide appear on any such lists. Other zinc  compounds do appear on these lists but not  because of the presence of zinc in those com pounds but rather because of the presence  of other substances such as cyanide, arsenic  and chromium.  Second,  the document  incriminates zinc  by citing the damages it causes to aquatic  life, animals and humans. In  truth, some  zinc compounds can be harmful to aquatic  life, most often because of the presence o!  other materials in those compounds such as  cyanide. Also, a number of zinc compounds  are used as nutritive supplements of many  animals and plants to prevent zinc deficien cies and to promote growth.  Concerning human health, EPA has not  set  any  human  health-related  drinking  water standards for zinc because the pres ence of massive quantities of zinc In drink ing water  is usually self-limiting, causing  bad odor and taste, and the effects of drink ing such water are transient and  leave no  permanent damage.  Further, incriminating zinc in connection  with  the El Paso smelter  is  intentionally  misleading. It has never been suggested that  zinc  emissions  from  that  smelter  have  caused any adverse human health effects and  the effects which were noted have been sub sequently discredited by reputable scientists.  In addition,  the smelting of zinc has not  been shown to cause the release of hazard ous quantities of other pollutants.  Third, the document incriminates zinc by  citing dozens of  instances where zinc has  been detected in the environment. In truth,  the studies from which this data were com piled provide no basis for incriminating zinc.  Instead, the studies merely show that chem ists have the capability to detect zinc. None  of the studies show that zinc has been de",1980
418,Senate,96,-0.284,1010,23,Mr. GRAVEL.," Mr. President,  ever  since the 1973 Arab oil embargo nuclear  promoters have been playing on  the  legitimate fears Americans have about  foreign fuel dependence. They say that  we should let them build their unsafe.  uneconomic plants ""for the sake of re ducing our dependence on foreign oil.""  It turns out that this claim is as mis leading as all the other claims they make  about plant safety,  radiation  toxicity,  and so forth.  Dr. George Weil,  a  pioneer nuclear  physicist for whom I have the greatest  respect, has carefully analyzed the situ ation and finds that nuclear advocates  are overstating the amount of foreign oil  saved by nuclear power by as much as  tenfold.  Dr. Weil's analysis was reported in the  August 23, 1980, issue of National Jour nal in an article by William J. Lanouette.  Mr. Lanouette also shed  light on  the  manner in which the nuclear industry  seems  to pull figures  from  thin air to  suit its needs. According to Lanouette,  after circulating a factsheet on Capitol  Hill claiming operating nuclear plants  represented 1.3 million barrels of oil per  day,  the nuclear lobby could not back  up  the claim. In fact, says Lanouette,  they told reporters:  It's just too complicated .... Besides, our  statistical needs are not  that specific. We  just need it for use on the Hill.  Mr. President,  that statement helps  explain why  the nuclear industry won  the ""Doublespeak Award"" last year from  the National Council of Teachers ot  English.  The claims about reducing foreign fuel  dependence become even more fraudu lent when one remembers that uranium  is already being imported to stretch our  very limited domestic supply. Proven re serves of uranium in the United States  suitable for the light water reactors now  operating and being built may not even  be sufficient to fuel the plants now op erating and under construction for their  full lifetimes.  It would be folly to suppose that the  industry's failure to be candid with Con gress and the American people is acci dental. Nuclear salesmen are burdened  with a product that is repugnant, eco nomically  indefensible, and is being so  recognized by encouragingly large num bers of people. To protect their self-in terest, they have little choice but to re sort  to misrepresentation. I hope that  Congress will not fall prey to it, and ir reversibly mortgage  the  health  and  safety cf the public based on misleading  information.  Mr. President, I request that the Au gust 23, 1980, National Journal article be  printed at this point in the RECORD.  The article follows:  (From the National Journal, Aug. 23, 1980]  NUCLEAR  POWER MEANS MORE ENERGY, BUT  DOES IT MEAN LESS OIL?  (By William J. Lanouette)  Nuclear power's lobbyists and advocates at  three Washington offices are busy assembling  statistics to demonstrate a tenet of U.S. en ergy policy: that domestic reactors are need ed to displace imported oil.  ""We're working them up now,"" said Betsy  Warren, 1:1.  registered lobbyist for the Edison  Electric Institute  (EE""!), an association of  privateiy  owned  utilities.  ""We've decided  that the three of us need to agree on a set  of numbers, so we can speak with one voice.""  The three are EEI, the Atomic Industrial  Forum. Inc.  (AIF). a nuclear trade associa tion,  and  the American Nuclear Energy  Council  (ANEC),  the  industry's full-time  lo!Jbying group. But beyond  the desire  to  agree among themselves on a set of figures,  the three groups will need the numbers for a  more significant reason.  Recent studies by an independent energy  consultant, drawing on the utility industry's  own clata. conclude that the connection be tween nuclear power and oil is insignificant  today end of dubious value for guiding en ergy policy in the future. The consultant is  George L. Weil, a nuclear physicist who has  been involved with atomic energy from the  first.  One of Weil's findings is that the nuclear  industry overstates the amount of imported  oil that nuclear power can replace by a fac tor of slx and that President Carter, in his  own statements, has overstated it tenfold.  ""The  obvious  conclusion  !rom  current  data,"" Weil said in an interview, ""is that if  you do want nuclear plants to displace imported oil, then the place you should build  them is in New England. But because of the  high population density, New England  is  probably the worst place to build them.""  CHALLENGING INDUSTRY  to 1952  Weil, who  first  spelled out some of his  findings in a letter to The New York Times  last Ft-bruary, has a  lengthy list of creden tials in the nuclear field. It was Weil, as a  you115 colleague of Enrico Fermi, who actual ly wit.hdrew the final control rod  to begin  the world's first controlled nuclear chain re action on Dec. 2, 1942, at Stagg Field in Chi cago.  Wei! also participated in the first atomic  bomb  test in 1945, and from 1947  worked at the Atomic Energy Commission as  chief of the reactor branch, chief of the civ ilian powu branch and as.;istant director of  the reactor development division.  As a civilian, Weil was the first o! the nu clear pioneers  to warn about safety prob lems, addressing the AIF on the hazards o!  nuclear power plants in 1954.  In 1955, he was appointed technical direc tor for U.S. participation in the United Na tions' first International Conference on the  Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. And, over  the years, Weil has become increasingly crit ical of nuclear power, basing his objections  on safety, economic and environmental con cerns.  Weil's  sharp challenge  to  the optimistic  conclusions of the nuclear industry and its  supporters is based on data he obtained by  sending questionnaires to the country's nu clear utlllties.  He said his findings contradict a  recent  statement to the Nuclear Regulatory Com mission by Roger J. Sherman, chairman of  the AIF, that ""the nuclear reactors presently  licensed  to operate ... are supplying  the  nation with electricity that otherwise could  require burning 1.5 million barrels of oil per  day."" or 548 million barrels a year.  Weil also cited a comment by President  Carter that ""each nuclear plant eliminates  the need to import 13 million barrels of oil  annually."" With 68 operating plants, that's  a total of some 884 million barrels a year.  Weil himself concludes  that 88 million  barrels a year ls much closer to the mark.  That's an astounding difference, which in  part can be traced to more generous assump tions by Sherman and Carter about  the  capacity factor of the nuclear plants-the  amount of power they actually produce com pared with their maximum potential.  But even that accounts !or only a small  part of the difference, which Well attributes  to the clash between two fundamental con cepts: equivalence and displacement. Even  if a nuclear plant produces electricity equiva lent to that generated by a given amount o!  oil, can you assume that the plant is dis placing that much oil? Or might it be dis placing other fuels, such as coal and gas?  Weil sa:vs that Sherman's and Carter's fig urec; assume  that every nuclear plant dis places an oil-powered plant. But that's not  true. he said. Nuclear plants located in the  coal re!!lons are more likely to be dlsnlacing  coal than oil and. in other areas, the alterna tives may have included natural gas or oll  as well.  Of tlte 68 nuclear plants that operated dur ing-1979. Well discovered, 10 ""definitely"" dis placed 67 m11llon barrels of oil. Another 43  ""definitelv"" df!'olaced coal. And the other 15  di.,nlaced elt.her oil. coal or gas.  He al'.mortloned the plants that disolaced  a mixture of fossil  fuels and arrived at a  rl'!n<7e of flct11al displacement between 67 and  J OF! milllnn barrels of oil !or the year. The  median. 88 million barrels. led Well to con clnde thiit Rherman overstated the nuclear oll conner-t.Jnn by a  factor of 6 and Carter  by a far.tor of 10.

419,House,96,-0.339,1205,23,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, today I have  introduced  emergency  legislation  au thorizing $50 million in U.S. aid to Italy  whose Provinces of Salerno, Naples, Po tenza, and Avellino were devastated by a  major earthquake on November 23, 1980.  My bill is identical to one sponsored on  November 25 by Senator KENNEDY, and  it is endorsed by President Carter.  While  the full enormity of  this dis aster has yet  to be measured, already  the earthquake has killed more  than  3,000 persons and  left another 300,000  homeless. No official damage estimates  have been released, but the area of dam age  covers more  than  square  miles. Entire  towns and villages have  been wiped out. As many as 90  villages have been destroyed.  The human tragedy demands an im mediate and generous response from the  U.S. Government. It has been our policy  whenever disaster strikes-but our cause  should be more compelling in the case  of Italy-a close  friend-and staunch  ally with whom we have such strong  bonds of mutual interest and the first  nation to call for the U.S. hostage re lease.  Four years ago when  the Friuli re gions of Italy were ravaged by an earth quake,  Congress  responded W1th  million in aid. The need today is great er-the time is shorter. Let us proceed  with  the greatest of speed toward en actment of this legislation, and let us  spare no effort in aiding the people of  Italy in their dark hours of need.  to 100  10,000  $25  THE LATE HONORABLE JOHN W.

420,House,96,-0.19,1257,23,Mr. AMBRO.," If the gentleman will  yield further, I  think it is important to  reemphasize what  tried  to say, and  that was that there are so many envi ronmental  concerns  that  this Nation  has,  that  the  subcommittee, with my  friend's considerable help, as the rank ing minority member, had to in effect set  in priority order  those  things which  would assure that the critical elements  in our survival would be addressed by  the  research branch of  the Environ mental Protection Agency.  The gentleman  listed some of  them.  Some of them I mentioned. All are im portant. But certainly  those mandates  which would assure clean water, potable  water, clean air, the effects of hazardous  waste, the tilt of the agency away from  utilizing rather spurious data and move  them in the direction of determining the  impact of those contaminants on human  threshold and human health and human  risk levels are the directions in which we  tried to move the agency with this bill  and its language, and indeed, as I  said  earlier, I have the assurance of the com mittee chairman, and I would hope that  whomever becomes chairman of the sub committee in the future, certainly if the  gentleman remains on that subcommit tee, that assurance will be supported by  even greater commitment that oversight  of ORD and the mandate that we con sider necessary will,  in fact, be under taken.

421,House,96,-0.126,1257,23,Mr. WATKINS.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in  support of this bill, and I would like to  echo what a  number of others have  stated, that there is a tremendous need  for adequate research, scientific research,  done with integrity, regarding many of  the environmental problems concerning  our country.  0 1420  There are many people on both sides  of the aisle who might have difficulty  with certain regulations from EPA, but  without question most of us deplore EPA  arbitrarily  setting  standards without  adequate research and scientific work  being done concerning these measures.  I would like to state that the gentleman  from New York <Mr. AMBRO) has done a  neat job, I want him to know that on  many occasions in the future this House  will be echoing his words when he said  that this country is confronted with a  time bomb as far as some of the prob lems that are going to result from con tamination of ground water.  I think many of our cities, many of our  citizens, are concerned with water being  contaminated and having our drinking  wa:ter supplies destroyed.  I would like to say, Mr. Speaker, that  there happens to be money in this bill  authorized for ground water research,  but I deeply regret that in the appro priation bill, under renewable resources,  that the needed money was not provided.  I hope this House will see fit to do so  in the future.  e ",1980
422,House,96,-0.391,1283,23,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to quote from  this columnist. He  says:  Like most  of New  England,  Franklin  County has no petroleum, coal, or uranium.  Except for one hydro-electric plant on  the  Connecticut River and some local wood burn ing, the county imports all its energy. This  fa.ct  led  to a group of  local businessmen,  students and other citizens working with the  University of Massachusetts at nearby Am herst to develop a county-wide energy a.na.ly sis. There was  some very good news. The  survey looked at the prospect for local energy  production which would pump consumer  dollars into local business, banks and invest ments. The researchers found  that a care fully planned transition to renewable energy  resources would not be difficult, would prob ard of living and would cut back sharply on  air and water pollution. Most  importantly,  ably yield actual increases in the local stand the study showed  that there was enough  local energy to meet the county's demands  in the year 1985.  The article concludes:  That is a spirit worth bottling and spread ing around.  The author of this column was Ronald  Reagan.  The Franklin County study was sup ported by a $36,000 grant from the De partment of Energy.  The enactment of this bill will allow  other communities around the country  to begin to free themselves from the~r  own energy import crises and use their  own resources, as has Franklin County,  so highly praised for its experience by  the President-elect.  This legislation is als:> vitally needed  because without  this  assistance,  the  States and  localities simply could not  afford to carry out their own self-help  energy conservation and renewable en ergy  resources activities mandated on  them by the Federal Government and  greatJy in the national interest.  I strongly urge passage of this legis lation.  ",1980

It is regrettable that the House will  not have the benefit of his services, par ticularly  in  the  judicial area  in  the  months and years ahead.

424,House,96,-0.384,1309,23,Ms. FERRARO.," Mr. Speaker, one of  the most  rewarding parts of being a  Member of Congress is having the oppor tunity to meet and form friendships with  people  from  totally  different  back grounds. LAM.\R GUDGER came to Wash ington, 2 years hefore I. from the moun tains of North 0arolina. His district ineludes the Great Smoky Mountain Na tional Park, which  is  the most visited  national park in the country. When my  fellow New Yorkers travel to the Smokies  on vacation,  they find a very different  life from the one they left in Queens.  our different backgrounds, and  the  differing needs of our constituents, give  lAMAR and me different  legislative in terests. But the process of learning about  the problems and concerns of people  from other  regions of  the country  is  what makes good  legislation, and good  gove::-nment.  Serving with people  like  LAMAR GUDGER has added to this learning  experience.  Of course, there are also areas where  our interests and concerns are the same.  On the Select Committee on Aging, and  especially on the Subcommittee on Re tirement  Income  and Employment,  I  have found that we share a strong com mitment  to protecting  the  rights and  interests of retirees as well as senior  citizens who continue to work.  LAMAR GUDGER has been  involved  in  North Carolina politics  for  the better  part of 30 years. In that time, he has  served the people of western North Caro lina as a member of the State House of  Representatives, as a district solicitor,  and as a member of the North Carolina.  State Senate in addition to his service in  Congress. In each of these forums, he has  earned the respect and the affection of  his colleagues. I want to join the rest of  my colleagues tonight in wishing LAMAll  GUDGER  the greatest success and happi ness in his future endeavors.   e ",1980

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  taking this special order today to honor  two great men, SAM DEVINE and BILL  HARSHA.  SAM and I, of course, have served on  the Committee on House Administra tion and have had a lot of fun several  times blocking pieces of legislation such  as public financing and other things that  we thought would work evil on the pol itics of the day. We are going to miss  him. We are going to miss his wise coun sel around here. We do say a sincere and  heartfelt, ""Thank you, SAM,""  for a  job  well done.  Mr. Speaker. I rise today to pay trib ute to a dear friend and distinguished  colleague, BILL HARSHA.  BILL HARSHA is that unique sort of man  who is possessed of such integrity, such  ability, such inherent class, that the re spect and admiration we all feel for him  transcend all partisan bounds.  His diligence and  fortitude are  the  stuff of legend. With his work, he has  carved out a place  in this House that  none can surpass and few ever hope to  equal; he has set a standard for all to  follow in years to come. I am reminded,  especially in view of BILL'S expertise in  the field of  transportation, of a poem  written some 40 years ago by Miss Will  Allen Dromgoole.  It  is  entitled  ""The  Bridge Builder,"" and with your  indul gence I would like to read it to you.  An old man going a lone highway  Came at the evening, cold and gray,  To a chasm vast and wide and steep,  With waters roll1ng cold and deep.  The old man crossed 1n the twlllght dim,  The sullen stream had no fears for him;  But he turned when safe on the other side,  And built a bridge to span the tide.  ""Old man,"" said a fellow pilgrim near,  ""You are wasting your strength with building here.  Your journey will end with the ending day,  You never again will pass this way.  You've crossed the chasm, deep and wide,  Why build you this bridge at eventide?""  The builder lifted his old gray head:  ""Good friend, in the path I have come,"" he  said,  ""There followeth after me to-day  A youth whose feet must pass this way.  The chasm that was as naught to me  To that faii:-haired youth may a pitfall be;  He, too, must cross in the twilight dim Good friend, I am rbuilding this bridge for  him.  My colleagues, I will not today say,  ""Farewell"" to BILL HARSHA.  I am con vinced that among the blessings of God  will be the privilege of seeing BILL as  frequently as ever. But I will take this  time to salute him on a job well done for  his  constituents  and  for his  beloved  country. It has been an honor to have  served  together with BILL HARSHA.  I  shall always be proud  to call him my  friend, and I hope that he will always  think the same of me.  ",1980
426,House,96,-0.269,1322,23,Mr. ANDERSON of California.," Mr.  Speaker, one of the things that makes  this body that we serve in so great, is the  way that Members with differing views,  learn  to pull  together and work with  each other for the good of the country.  I think that, often as not, new Mem bers come to the House viewing their col leagues on the other side of the aisle as  the ""enemy."" Then, they begin working  with people like BILL HARSHA. And they  quickly come to appreciate and be thank ful for  the wisdom,  insight into prob lems, and warm friendliness that a BILL  HARSHA can and does give them.  I have served on the Public Works and  Transportation Committee with BILL  HARSHA fer many years. Like all of us, at  times he was concerned with partisan  issues. But his primary and overriding  concern, always, was for the good of the  country, his State, and those Ohio con stituents that sent him, over and over  again, to Congress.  Over the years I have had the pleasure  of working together with BILL on many  issues. And I believe that on each one  of them, the results have been better be cause of his active participation and the  meaningful contributions he has made.  BILL always had a great instinct for what  would work, and what would not. He has  the ability  to  look at something  that  seems fine on paper, and point out prob lems it will have in the ""real world."" So,  it is a great tribute to BILL that our Pub lic Works Committee has been able to  put together so much outstanding legis lation over the years.  As often as not, a major craftsman  behind these bills has been BILL HARSHA.  He has been a leader and he has been a  spokesman, and he will be missed. Mr.  Speaker, BILL HARSHA is such a man that  even after he leaves us,  I  feel certain  that many of us will be calling him for  advice and guidance on legislation that  is before us. We cannot afford not to tap  the well of information and mature judg ment that is within BILL HARSHA.  Whatever BILL chooses  to do  in the  months and years ahead, be it hunt and  fish in Ohio, or the resumption of an ac tive career, Lee and I know he will do  it well,  and wish him, Rosemary and  their family all the best.

Under his chairmanship we have ac complished  a  number of significant  things. During  this year  alone, we  have  drafted  and  reported  seven  authorizing bills which not only  re flect careful legislative oversight, but  which more  importantly  reflect  the  subcommittee's commitment to fiscal  responsibility. Not one of those bills  was 1 cent over budget; and, as the  ranking Republican on  the subcom mittee, I am pleased to say that, on  our subcommittee, fiscal responsibility  is a bipartisan concern.  31411  Early in this Congress, we in Penn sylvania were  faced with  impending  nuclear disaster at  the Three Mile  Island nuclear  facility. One of  the  greatest fears and most valid concerns  of  the people  living  in  the area of  Three Mile  Island was  the human  health and environmental impacts of  the disaster. Both, as  the Congress man representing  the district which  was in danger from being both down wind and downstream, and, in my role  as ranking Republican on the subcom mittee having oversight responsibility  for both DOE health and environmen tal research and EPA environmental  research, I went to JERRY AMBRO  and  explained the problems we Pennsylva nians were facing and asked for field  hearings to examine the issue. No one  could have been more accommodating.  We not only had field hearings, hear ings which did much  to  reduce  the  fears of  the community, but which  also added a great deal to our under standing of the problems facing both  Pennsylvania and the rest of the coun try if a similar incident were to occur  elsewhere in the future.  I have the privilege of representing  one of the finest farming areas in the  entire world  in  the  Pennsylvania  Dutch Country around Lancaster, Pa.  One of my most pressing concerns is  the  preservation of prime  farmland  from development and from conver sion to waste dump sites. Little did I  know that out on Long Island, JERRY  AMBRO was plagued by the same prob lem and shared the same concerns. He  joined me as a staunch supporter and  together we convinced EPA to issue a  national policy in favor of protecting  farmlands.  Finally,  I would  like  to commend  JERRY AMBRo for his chairmanship of  our subcommittee. We considered a  great deal of  legislation each year,  much of which could have been made  highly partisan, but the subcommittee  was indeed bipartisan in its approach  to issues and problems. JERRY AMBRO  encouraged members of the subcom mittee to develop their own interests  and freely assisted Members on both  sides of the aisle in their endeavors.  For  instance,  the subcommittee ad dressed Congressman RITTER'S and my  concerns about the fact that EPA has  proposed diesel particulate standards  which may cripple the truck, tractor,  and auto industries. When we raised  this concern and asked for hearings,  JERRY AMBRo not only was quick  to  schedule hearings for us, but was also  most helpful in insuring that EPA Ad ministrator Douglas Castle appeared  before us.  I have considered it personally re warding  to work with JERRY AMBRO  and his leadership of the Subcommit tee on Natural Resources and Environ ment will be long remembered by his  colleagues.e  ",1980
429,,96,0.306,1426,23,Mr. CAMPBELL.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to call the attention of my  colleagues  to  today's announcement  that George Rogers of the University  of South Carolina's Fighting Game cocks has been chosen to receive the  1980 Reisman Trophy,  the  coveted  award given annually since 1935 to the  Nation's outstanding college  football  player.  This honor is well deserved by Mr.  Rogers, who has had an outstanding  and distinguished career in addition to  being  this  season's premier  player.  During his 4 years of determined and  powerful running at the University of  South Carolina, George Rogers has  rushed  for  just under  5,000  yards,  placing him  fourth  best  in  college  football history. He was the Nation's  second leading rusher and a first-team  All-American last year, and he is foot ball's leading rusher this season with  1,781 yards. Among his amazing statis tics  is his string of rushing for 100  yards or more  in his  last 21  games  against opponents including Georgia,  Michigan, and Southern California.  Under his prowess and team leader ship  the Gamecocks have  compiled  their  second  consecutive 8-3  record  and a bowl berth. Later this month  South Carolina will play  the highly  ranked Pittsburgh Panthers  in  the  Gator Bowl where Mr. Rogers will  have  the opportunity to surpass the  5,000 yard career rushing mark.  George Rogers  is a winner on and  off the field. A modest and humble in dividual who  only  cares  about his  team, not personal honor, Mr. Rogers  is the fin:t to recognize the efforts and  talents of his  teammates and Coach  Jim Carlen and his  assistants who  have made  this  award possible  for  him. In fact, I know the Reisman is an  honor he will share with them based  on their hard work together to build a  successful program at the university.  Having closely followed his playing  years at South Carolina, I know that  George Rogers will have an illustrious  professional career and be extremely  successful in all his future endeavors.  My best wishes go to him and every one at the University of South Caroli na on this momentous day.e  THE TIME IS CLOSER THAN  MOST THINK  HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 1, 1980  e ",1980
