0,11,1,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker, we  cannot see it, we cannot hear it, we  cannot feel it. We cannot even detect  it on radar. I am not talking about the  B-2 bomber today, I am talking about  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. It is about  as effective as placing a stop sign at  the Indy 500. It has done absolutely  nothing. Now it is beginning to rip off  the Social Security trust fund.  Mr. Speaker, I plan to introduce leg islation this week that would simply.  repeal Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. It is  a  turkey that should be shot down.  The American people cannot vote for  the Director of the Office of Manage ment and Budget. They vote for us. It  is our job to straighten this out.  Mr. Speaker, we  started Gramm Rudman with a $200 billion deficit.  Today we have a $204 billion deficit  and a bunch of IOU's in the Social Se curity account. Think about it.  THANKS, ""COLUMBIA,"" FOR A  JOB WELL DONE  <Mr. VOLKMER  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1990
1,11,1,Mr. VOLKMER.," Mr. Speaker, it is  with a great deal of pride that I con gratulate the crew and all of NASA for  the  success  of  the  just-completed  flight of space shuttle Columbia. This  record-setting  flight ended Saturday  with a  remarkable night-time  touch down.  We can all be proud of the extraordi nary recovery our space program has  experienced in the last 3 years. And  this latest flight adds another dimen sion to that success.  This was  the  longest  flight by a  shuttle-11 days. This was the heavi est load in shuttle history-115 tons at  touchdown. But possibly the most re markable aspect of this flight was the  capture of an 11-ton satellite which  was  then  returned  to Earth  in  the  shuttle's cargo bay.  Those of us who have been early and  constant supporters of the space pro gram  and  specifically  the  shuttle  projects watched with pride as the five  members  of  the  shuttle  crew  per formed perfectly.  My congratulations go  to the crew  members and those on the ground who  once again have proven to the Nation  and to the world that America's supe riority  in  space has been  regained.  Thanks Columbia for a job well done.  D 1320  PRESIDENT  CRISTIAN!  STOOD  UP TO BOTH THE LEFT AND  RIGHT IN EL SALVADOR  <Mr. DREIER of California asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.)  ",1990
2,11,1,Mr. DREIER  of  California.," Mr.  Speaker, when one thinks of all the  developments which have taken place  since we adjourned last November 22  there are many issues which could be  discussed; of course successfully get ting rid of that narco-military dictator  Manuel A. Noriega in Panama, seeing  the crumbling of the Eastern bloc and  of course a wide  range of domestic  issues.  But I would like to on this first day  of the second session of the lOlst Con gress say  that  I believe one of  the  most  important developments which  took place during  the congressional  recess was taken by the duly elected  President of El Salvador, a man who  represents  the  first  transition  from  one  democratically  elected  govern ment to another in the history of that  country. What he did, Mr. Speaker,  was he very clearly stood up to both  the left and the right by working to  bring to justice those who are respon sible for the tragic massacre of Father  Ignacio Ellacuria and the five other  Jesuits.  We need to provide firm and strong  support to President Cristiani and this  fledgling democracy.  THE  HOUSE  SHOULD  OVER WHELMINGLY OVERRIDE THE  PRESIDENT'S VETO  (Mr. MORRISON  of Connecticut  asked and was given permission to ad dress the House for 1 minute and to  revise and extend his remarks.)  ",1990
3,11,1,Mr. MORRISON  of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Speaker, tomorrow this House will  vote on an override of the President's  veto of legislation to provide protec tion for Chinese students here in the  United States.  I urge my colleagues to overwhelm ingly vote in favor of this legislation  which passed the House in November  by a vote of 403 to 0.  This is not just routine immigration  legislation; this is human rights legis lation and we must answer for Amer ica the question of which side are we  on?  The President has lost his way. He  has kowtowed to the killers in Beijing.  He has forgotten that the proud flag  of America stands for human rights  and democracy. This legislation stands  for  that proud  tradition and  those  proud values.  We,  the Congress, must speak on  behalf of  the American people and  teach the lesson that in a democracy  wrong decisions by the leader can be  redressed.  We have accountability; it is the ac countability we were  sent here  to  bring to our Government.  On behalf of  the  people  of  the  United States the House should over whelmingly say  to  the Chinese stu dents and the Chinese people, ""We be lieve that the future of China lies in  democracy and freedom and we stand  up for that future.""  DECISION  TO  ORDER  27 ,000  ARMED TROOPS INTO PANAMA  MAY HAVE BEEN AN ACT OF  WAR  <Mr. BATES asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1990
4,11,1,Mr. BATES.," Mr. Speaker, amid the  debate on the President's decision to  send  troops  to Panama we must,  I  think, question the manner in which  that decision was carried out. Were  the appropriate articles of the Consti tution considered and followed when  the  decision was made  to  invade  Panama? The power to declare war is  granted solely to the Congress of the  United States by the Constitution. If  existing  conditions  protecting  this  right are inadequate, additional meas ures must be developed and certainly  the War Powers Act is inadequate.  ",1990
5,24,1,Mr.  BURTON  of  Indiana.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding,  and  I  also  thank her  for  taking this special order.  The Chinese students in the United  States, I believe, as the gentlewoman  has well explained, require protection.  Many of them have been active in a  democracy movement  in China, and  many of  their  relatives  have been  active, and they are afraid that they  are going to be forced to go back and  suffer  the persecution  that we wit nessed  in Tiananmen Square. And  that repression continues.  I  think  everybody  in  the United  States felt horrified when  they saw  those  tanks  go  into  Tiananmen  Square,  and  they  found out  subse quently  that  they  literally  ground  young Chinese  students who were  seeking democracy  into meat on the  streets.  D 1450  In addition  to  that, Mr. Speaker,  these young people used the United  States as a model. Their Statue of Lib erty that they showed in Tiananmen  Square was modeled after our Statue  of Liberty; their Statue of Democracy  rather.  Mr. Speaker, we should feel a close  kinship  for  those Chinese  students  who are here in this country studying,  and who want  democracy  in  their  country, and who want to make sure  that that happens at some point in the  future and who do not want to have to  go back prematurely and suffer the  consequences of their call for democ racy.  So, Mr. Speaker, I support the legis lation of the gentlewoman from Cali fornia [Ms. PELOSI]. I will vote to over ride tomorrow. We do not always see  eye to eye. This issue cuts across party  lines. It cuts across philosophical lines.  On both sides of the aisle, whether we  are liberal, conservative, Democrat, or  Republican; I think that we are going  to find tomorrow that there is going to  be overwhelming support for the legis lation of the gentlewoman from Cali fornia [Ms. PELOSI] on overriding the  President's veto.  So, Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the  gentlewoman  from  California  [Ms.  PELOSI] for that.  I would  like  to say  just one more  thing, Mr. Speaker. I am a big sup porter of President Bush and Vice  President QUAYLE.  I  think my voting  record will  indicate  that  I  support  them as much, or probably more than,  most people in the House, and I really  support the administration and,  like  most people  in  this country,  think  that  they are doing an outstanding  job.  However, Mr. Speaker, I was a little  bit chagrined when I saw the head of  the NSC, Mr.  Scowcroft, General  Scowcroft, and one of our assistant  secretaries, Mr. Eagleburger,  go  to  China and start working toward open ing up a normal relationship so soon  after the Tiananmen massacre when  there  have  been  no  appreciable  changes in the attitudes of the Chi nese Government toward their people.  The repression continues, and the re pression will continue until the world  brings  pressure upon  that Govern ment to make positive change.  So, while  I have great admiration  and support  for  this administration  and all  the  things they are doing,  I  would say this is one place where I  take strong exception to  the actions  that have been taking place vis-a-vis  our relations with China. We should  let the Chinese Government know in  no uncertain terms that this type of  action is  intolerable, that the people  of the United States of America and  the people of the world will not stand  idly by and accept this kind of action  and that we are going to do everything  we can to bring pressure to bear upon  it, economic pressure, or whatever it  takes, for them to bring about positive  change.  Mr. Speaker, we have seen in East ern Europe countries that have been  under the boot, the heel, of commu nism for 40 years move  toward free dom and democracy, and we should be  helping them, and we will be helping  them, and at the time we are helping  these countries, these fledgling democ racies, head  for  full democracy and  participation in the world community  we should not be opening our arms to  a  repressive  totalitarian Communist  government in China.  Mr. Speaker,  tomorrow  I will  be  very, very happy to vote with the gen tlewoman  from  California  [Ms.  PELOSI] to override this veto, and I ap preciate her yielding this time to me.  ",1990
6,24,1,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I appreci ate  the  remarks  of  the gentleman  from  Indiana.  [Mr. BURTON].  I  also  thank him for signing the Dear Col league in support of the override and  for his help on this issue.  Mr. Speaker, this is not a partisan  issue, as the gentleman from Indiana  [Mr. BURTON] so ably pointed out. It  has never been intended to be anti the  President. It is an issue that passed  the House and passed the Senate with out one negative vote, 403 to 0 in the  House of Representatives. I am very  proud of the bipartisan support that  we were able to gather for the bill be cause it is a reasonable bill, and it does  precisely what it sets out to do, to pro tect the students. So, it is just a dis agreement on tactics.  Mr. Speaker, I  think we all would  like  to  look  forward  to  a  brilliant  future with China,  a  future bright  with cultural, economic, and political  ties, but it has to be done at least with  some  integrity  from our standpoint,  and I think that sending the message  that this bill would send is a clearer  message  than the message  that was  contained  in  the  toast  that General  Scowcroft made  when  he  visited  China. Because the issue of safety is so  critical and so fundamental to this bill  that we must protect the students be cause they cannot go back unless it is  safe,  I was  particularly  concerned  about the choice of words of General  Scowcroft when he lifted his glass to  toast the authorities in Beijing when  he said, ""There are forces in both of  our societies which would  strive  to  thwart or redirect our efforts to coop eration. We must take action to stop  those negative forces.""  Mr.  Speaker,  I  found  that  toast  frightening,  equating us with  them  and that we must take action to stop  those negative forces. I think a better  message to the Chinese authorities is  that when people speak out  in  the  United States of America on behalf of  democracy that we are not going  to  send them home to a situation where  people get killed for speaking out for  freedom, as the gentleman from Indi ana [Mr. BURTON] described in his re marks.  Also I think the gentleman from In diana [Mr. BURTON] mentioned East ern Europe, and I  think that is very  relevant here because the day or two  before the President left on his trip  for Malta, taking with him all of our  hopes and aspirations for peace in the  world and all of our good wishes for  that,  the Secretary of State said  in  effect, and I think these are his exact  words, but in effect he said that we  must support the prodemocratic move ment in Eastern Europe and help out  so that it can proceed and succeed.  So, Mr. Speaker, that gave us hope  that maybe the President would sign  the Chinese student bill the next day  because that is what we were doing helping  a  prodemocratic movement  proceed and succeed. However, as far  as  I know,  the  last official act  the  President performed was not to sign  the Chinese student bill, and he sent it  back to the House unsigned. It was a  little disappointing.  Mr. Speaker, I think that one of the  disadvantages  that we have  is  that  people are thinking in old ways. They  are  thinking,  ""Well, we've not had  human rights as an item on the table  in our relationship with China. It has  been an issue in Europe, so it will con tinue to be an issue in Europe, but in  China it isn't an issue.""  I know that the President, and the  Vice President, and the Secretary of  State, and General Scowcroft all care  about human rights  throughout  the  world. There  is  no question  about  that. But I think that this has to be a  recognition that history is in a hurry.  It is in a hurry in Eastern Europe, it is  in a hurry in China, and we cannot  revert  to old ways of dealing with  China.

HEARING ON CHINESE  STUDENTS AND CHINA POLICY  ",1990
19,63,1,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, this  morning the Subcommittee on Immi gration and Refugee Affairs held a  hearing  on  Chinese  students  and  human rights in China. The testimony  received was really quite disturbing and extremely relevant to our upcom ing vote on overriding the President's  veto of the Emergency Chinese Immi gration Relief Act.  The subcommittee heard from Am bassador Winston Lord, our Ambassa dor to China during the Reagan ad ministration, who expressed criticism  of the administration's policy toward  China, and urged Congress to override  the President's veto of the Emergency  Chinese Immigration Relief Act.  We also heard very troubling state ments from Chinese students in Amer ica who have been threatened and har assed by their own Embassy officials  for even minimal participation in pro democracy  activities  here.  Chinese  Embassy officials have demanded that  students  involved  in  the democracy  movement submit written confessions  and self-criticisms of their pro-democ racy activities, and many have been in formed that they will be branded for  life as traitors and counterrevolution aries if they do not.  The students reported that the har assment has in fact increased since the  President vetoed the bill on November  30.  Finally, the subcommittee received a  legal analysis from the Congressional  Research  Service which  highlights  some of the points on which the ad ministration's actions  on behalf of  Chinese students may be subject  to  court challenges. The  legal analysis  was published yesterday by the Ameri can Law Division of CRS.  Mr. President, I ask that Ambassa dor Lord's statement before the sub committee and that of Dr. Hai Ching  Zhao be included in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the state ments were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  OPENING  REMARKS  BY  WINSTON  LORD,  SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, JANUARY 23,  1990  Mr. Chairman, Members of the Commit tee:  Thank you for inviting me to comment on  the Emergency Chinese Immigration Relief  Act of 1989 <H.R. 2712).    Strengthening America's relations with  China has been my mission for two decades.  Thus I come to the debate concerning Chi nese students in this country in the broader  context of American policy  toward China  and our long range national interests. My  journey to this Committee, I confess, has  been a troubling one.  As  a concerned citizen,  I  am generally  against Congressional micromanagement of  foreign policy and the rigidities often intro duced by tactical legislation. As a bipartisan  public servant for twenty years, my inclina tion  is  to  support  a President's foreign  policy whenever I can. As a Republican who  admires President Bush, served him and ap plauds his overall foreign policy, I particu larly regret having to oppose this Adminis tration.  Nonetheless, with  considerable  ambiva lence and reluctance, I am here to urge the  Congress to override the President's veto.  This I strongly believe: fairly or unfairly,  the vote on  this  issue will be  interpreted  abroad and at home not just as a decision on  how best  to protect Chinese students  in  America, but more fundamentally as a refer endum on our posture toward the current  Chinese regime.  This is the reality: fairly or unfairly, the  veto, if sustained, would reinforce the mind set and mandate of those who have proceed ed from massacre to repression; those who  predict America will be lulled by cosmetic  gestures  and  return  to business-as-usual;  those who dismiss the Chinese as a people  apart from the global winds of change.  This, too, is the reality: the legislation, if  enacted, would send a powerful message of  encouragement  to  those  in China whose  voices have been silenced and to Chinese  citizens everywhere who seek a freer, more  open country.  As for the legal arguments, they are com plex and difficult for the amateur to judge.  On balance I think they also favor override.  Clearly the President shares the Congres sional concern about the dangers to Chinese  students and believes his means accomplish  the same ends as the legislation at hand.  Many lawyers as well as members of Con gress assert, however, that his administra tive action could be challenged  in court.  Furthermore, reliance on INS instructions  carries less weight symbolically, if not legal ly, than an executive order or Presidential  determination.  Whatever the ultimate  legal  judgments,  there is no question that today Chinese stu dents feel uncertain, uneasy-and vulnera ble. It is best to remove all doubts through  the  unambiguous means  of  legislation.  Those who have lived in China where laws  do not protect the individual seek security  in the laws of the United States. Passage of  legislation would fortify the students psy chologically as well as legally.  The  President's  administrative  action  laudably  extends protection beyond  stu dents. The Congress, if it cannot amend this  bill, should urgently review  this aspect to  ensure that there is no risk to Chinese here  who are not students.  The crucial consideration, however,  re mains the diplomatic context of the looming  vote.  In response to series of major American  initiatives,  the Chinese  regime has made  only minimal moves while still pursuing its  overall policy of suppression, rollback of re forms and attacks on foreign influence. The  passage of this legislation would make clear  that Americans are not fooled by smoke and  mirrors, that we are a serious people.  The Chinese people share the same aspi rations as Eastern Europeans and others  around the world. They, not the hardliners  in Beijing, represent the future of China and thus our long term national interest.  Their day is not distant. I believe there will  be a more moderate, humane government in  Beijing before  this  legislation  is  due  to  expire. Whenever such a government does  take hold and once again makes China invit ing, the Congress should repeal this bill. We  should  then  encourage  the  students  to  return to their homeland and work to lift its  horizons.  Surely  the President,  through his veto,  does not wish to send the wrong signals to  China or to the students here. But this is  the inescapable consequence of the recent  pattern of Administration actions  toward  Beijing. If the veto and accompanying ad ministrative instructions were carried out in  the context of a firm, balanced policy of  condemnation and connection,  the Presi dent's position would probably not be mis construed. But in the wake of the misguided  Scowcroft missions  and other unilateral  American steps, defeat of  this  legislation  would be assessed by both Beijing and the  world as one more step toward unrequited  normalization. Unfair perhaps, but reality.  This need not have been the case. Until  the announcement of the December Scow croft trip, the balance of our overall China  policy seemed about right. I, for one, con sistently supported  the President  for six  months, including in my November testimo ny before  the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee. Although  I  sounded much  harsher criticism of Chinese policies than  the Administration,  I  thought  that  the  President was  correct  to  stress our  long  term concerns while maintaining selective  sanctions.  In my view the Scowcroft journey-in sub stance and style-destroyed that balance. In  the process it also shattered the broad bi partisan consensus on China policy that we  had enjoyed for twenty years through five  administrations. Rather than reiterate my  reasoning I ask that my December 19, 1989  Washington Post article be included as part  of  the record.  I wrote that editorial <and  had previously supported  the Administra",1990

22,167,1,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I rise to  introduce the Department of the Envi ronment Act  of  1990,  a  bill  that,  among other  things,  transforms  the  Environmental Protection Agency into  a new Cabinet-level department, the  Department of the Environment.  I am pleased that the distinguished  ranking member of the Governmental  Affairs Committee, Senator ROTH,  is  here to join me in this introduction,  since the bill is a product of a  joint  effort involving ourselves, our staffs,  and the administration.  I am also pleased  to announce as  original cosponsors Senators LIEBER MAN, KOHL, LEVIN,  LAUTENBERG,  and  BINGAMAN.  Mr. President, 20 years ago, the Con gress created the Environment Protec tion Agency as a response to what was  perceived as a serious and growing pollution problem  that  threatened  the  health and well being of the American  people. We have made progress  in  many areas,  though not enough  to  become complacent  in any area.  In  some  areas,  problems  have  gotten  worse. Twenty years ago, few persons  thought about the long-range  trans port of pollutants across international  boundaries; of acid rain falling in con tinental  Europe  because  coal was  being burned  in England; of ocean  dumping of toxic substances that wash  up on distant shores; of radioactive  particles  falling  from  the  sky over  France,  Germany,  Belgium,  and  Poland from a nuclear accident in the  Soviet Union; of destruction of  the  stratospheric ozone  layer,  that pro tects  us  from  damaging ultraviolet  rays, from the release of millions of  tons of chlorofluorocarbon compounds  in our spray cans, refrigerators and air  conditioners; and of the possibility of  a potentially disastrous warming of  the Earth from emissions of carbon di oxide resulting from  the burning of  fossil fuels.  Last November, the Administrator of  EPA attended an international meet ing with environmental ministers from  67 other countries to discuss and adopt  an agreement in principle on the stabi lization of carbon dioxide emissions.  Like  it or not,  international agree ments  to  achieve  environmental  progress are now a necessary feature  of  sound  environmental  protection  policy.  These global concerns-stratospheric  ozone  destruction,  the  creation  of  ozone ""smog"" from deteriorating for ests, acid  rain, desertification, ocean  pollution, and trafficking in hazardous  waste, as well as the national pollution  problems stemming from development  and  industrialization  have  induced  every major  industrialized nation  to  create a ministerial post for environ mental protection with the only excep tion being the United States, where  environmental concerns are handled  by subcabinet officers.  As we approach the end of the 20th  century,  it  is  time  for  the United  States to move aggressively in a lead ership position across the board in the  solution of global environmental prob lems. To do otherwise is to consign the  quality of life of all Americans to the  policy decisions of others-and what  else  should one call  that except a  threat to our national security?  It is a fact of diplomatic life that the  seriousness with which one views an other government's concerns is influ enced by the stature of the person ar ticulating  those concerns. A subcab inet EPA does not send the appropri ate signal to the rest of the world as to  the priority and leadership to be given  by the United States to the cause of  environmental protection. If this were  the only argument in favor of elevat",1990
23,193,1,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President,  today  I  am offering  legislation  on  behalf of myself and Senator HATCH to  eliminate a provision that permits pen sion funds to receive less than compre hensive audits.  Our private pension system is based  on the concept of fiduciary responsi bility and full disclosure. The integrity  of our private pension system is essen tial. In 1988 employer pensions paid  the Nation's retirees more than $222  billion in benefits, compared to $148  billion paid to retirees by Social Secu rity. Independent audits play an im portant role in securing full disclosure  for plan beneficiaries.  Currently, under the Employee Re tirement Income Security Act, pension  funds are only required to receive lim ited scope audits. A limited-scope audit  means that pension fund managers are  allowed to instruct auditors not to ex amine assets held in government-regu lated entities, such as banks or insur ance companies. The bottom  line  is  that some pension plans are currently  receiving  less  than  thorough audits.  Absent  thorough and comprehensive  audits, the integrity and assurance in tended by ERISA for pension benefici aries will not be achieved. This is 'be coming  an  increasingly  important  issue because of the trend of deregula tion of our financial institutions, and  the growing size of private pension  funds. As our society ages, these funds  will  take on an even greater signifi cance.  The importance of full disclosure is  not solely limited to plan beneficiaries.  All taxpayers have a very real interest  in assuring that private pension plans  receive a  thorough and  independent  audit. Under ERISA, the majority of  private pension plans are insured by  the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corpo ration. Like a variety of other Federal  insurance plans, the PBGC is a Gov ernment-sponsored  enterprise. Over  the past decade we  certainly have  learned the importance of maintaining  tight regulation and requiring full dis closure of  industries and enterprises  enjoying Federal insurance.  Our  pension  insurance  system  is  strong today. It is only with the type  of  continued vigilance  provided by  thorough audits and meaningful regulation that we can assure the integrity  of  the  private  pension  system  for  future beneficiaries.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the bill be print ed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the    S.2012  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION  I.

24,193,1,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased today to cosponsor legislation  introduced by Senator NANCY KASSE BAUM  to eliminate a provision in cur rent  law  that permits  limited scope  audits of private pension plans under  the Employee Retirement Income Se curity Act of 1974 [ERISAJ.  I  agree with Senator KASSEBAUM  that our pension insurance system is  strong today. I also share with Senator  KASSEBAUM and the Secretary of Labor  the concern that we remain vigilant in  our efforts to ensure the continuing  integrity of our Nation's system.  This bill  represents an  important  step in that regard. Further, I under stand that the Secretary of Labor is  currently reviewing a number of pro posals  aimed  at  improving  and  strengthening ERISA enforcement. I  look forward to working with the ad ministration in the coming months in  developing  appropriate measures  to  further ensure the continued strength  and integrity of private pension plans.

25,206,1,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, today  I join Senator DoLE as an original co sponsor in introducing a  joint resolu tion which will honor the lOOth anni versary of the birth of Dwight David  Eisenhower by designating October 14,  1990, as ""Dwight D. Eisenhower Day""  and calling for a joint meeting of Con gress to commemorate this centennial.  In furtherance of this national cele bration,  the Eisenhower Foundation,  an organization devoted to promoting  the goals, ideals, and legacy of Dwight  Eisenhower, the Dwight D. Eisenhow er Society, which conducts programs  to highlight the work of Eisenhower,  Gettysburg College, and other organi zations will host a  series of events  during the year to celebrate this anni versary. The activities will include a 4day symposium comprised of interna tional  scholars,  government  leaders,  and military  leaders  at Gettysburg  College  in October 1990, as well as  presentations, seminars, art exhibits,  and other events in honor of President  Eisenhower.  Raised in Abilene, KS, President Ei senhower developed  his  interest  in  military history early in his childhood.  He began an honorable career of mili tary service with his enrollment in the  U.S. Military Academy at West Point  in 1911. Following graduation in 1915,  Eisenhower spent several years serving  his country in ranking military posi tions. After World War I, he re~mmed  the permanent rank of captain and  soon was promoted to major. Receiv ing a series of promotions, Eisenhower  continued  his  loyal  service  to  the  United States throughout World War  II. In 1944, his superior military skill  was recognized with the award of the  rank of five-star general of the U.S.  Army.  Dwight  Eisenhower  subsequently  went on to serve as president of Co lumbia University and as the Supreme  Commander of  the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization [NATO]. On No vember 4, 1952, the country recognized  Eisenhower's ability  and  vision  by  electing him the 34th President of the  United States. He was  reelected  4  years later.  As President of the United States,  Eisenhower was known for his staunch  anticommunism. His personal dislike  of this oppressive system evolved into  a policy of aiding any country threat ened by Communist aggression or sub version-the Eisenhower doctrine.  In  1961, Eisenhower delivered a farewell  address which articulated a four-point  agenda for  the Nation. The  themes  identified by Eisenhower almost 30  years ago are among the most pressing  issues of our time, typifying Eisenhow er's wisdom and foresight.  It is fitting that Gettysburg should  honor Eisenhower since his connection  to the town can be traced back to 1915  when he  first  traveled  there  as  a  senior cadet at West Point  to study  military tactics. Three years later Ei senhower returned as commander of  Camp Colt,  a  deserted Gettysburg  campsite which underwent  transfor mation into a training center for the  newly formed Tank Corps. Upon com pletion of his duty, Eisenhower  left  the area, but returned once again in  1946 to receive an honorary doctor of  laws degree from Gettysburg College.  In 1950, President Eisenhower pur chased land in Gettysburg and built a  home for his family, in which he lived  at various times during his Presidency  and thereafter. He later served as a  trustee of Gettysburg College  from  1961 to 1969. The Eisenhower farm in  Gettysburg today is maintained by the  U.S. National Park Service as a continuing tribute to the significant con tributions of Dwight Eisenhower.  Last October at Gettysburg College,  which  sponsored one of  the many  kickoff ceremonies nationwide for the  Eisenhower centennial, David Eisen hower, grandson and biographer of  the  former  President,  shared  his  thoughts about his grandfather and  Gettysburg:  Dwight D.  Eisenhower's  identification  with Gettysburg was profound. This was  the place I knew him best and the place he  felt natural and at home. I always hoped  the town and the college would respond in  the way they have today.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  to  join in supporting  this  important  resolution to recognize the service of  President Dwight D. Eisenhower on  the lOOth anniversary of his birth.  By Mr. SARBANES <for himself,  Ms. MIKULSKI, Mr. GLENN, Mr.  MATSUNAGA, Mr. HOLLINGS, Mr.  SIMON, Mr. DECONCINI, Mr.  BURDICK, Mr. KERRY, Mr. PELL,  Mr. NUNN, Mr. DOMENIC!, and  Mr. DODD):  S.J.

FEDERAL EMPLOYEES RECOGNITION WEEK  e ",1990
26,206,1,Mr.  SARBANES.," Mr.  President,  today I am introducing a joint resolu tion to designate the week beginning  March 5, 1990, as Federal Employees  Recognition Week. I have introduced  similar  resolutions  in previous Con gresses to honor the men and women  who work in jobs that are so critically  important to the strength and vitality  of our Nation. The  individuals who  make up the Federal work force have  made significant contributions to im prove the quality of life and provide  essential services for Americans and  indeed  for  others  throughout  the  world. I again want to commend the  more than 3 million men and women  who perform those jobs.  Federal workers continue to be the  source of growth and development in  America, helping Americans achieve  strong, energetic, and prosperous com munities. I am proud that our Govern ment has such a highly qualified and  competent work force. If our Govern ment did not have such knowledgea ble, capable hardworking individuals,  America would not be in the forefront  of medical and scientific research and  the development of new  technology:  Great achievements have been made  by Federal employees over the years  in these areas.  In my view, the Nation as a whole,  and perhaps the entire world has ben efited  from  the accomplishments of  Federal workers. The men and women  who work  for our Government are  positive about their work and the op",1990
27,219,1,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I want  to take just a moment today to recog nize an example of the Montana spirit  of voluntarism.  Under the sponsorship of the Mon tana Council of  the Boy Scouts of  America,  an organization known  as  Project Good Turn has mobilized  to  clean up over 5,000 tons of trash from  Montana's highways and public lands.  Though  it  involves over  con cerned Montanans,  this  remarkable  effort does not cost the American tax payer a single dime.  Mr. President, I salute the hundreds  of Montanans  involved  in  Project  Good Turn. I ask that a description of  the accomplishments of Project Good  Turn be printed in the RECORD.  The summary follows:  1,500  SUMMARY OF PROJECT ""Goon TURN""  On April 23, 1988 approximately 15,000  participants including boy scouts and their  leaders along with numerous civic organiza tions  throughout  the  state of Montana  scoured the highways, parks, campgrounds,  and other public areas to rid our environ ment of  the  large amount of litter being  dumped onto our public lands. This clean up  campaign known as Project ""Good Turn""  led to the ultimate removal and disposal of  approximately 2,000 tons of trash in only a  3-hour period.  Project ""Good Turn"" is an outgrowth of  the original clean up birthed in 1985 called  Project ""93"" which was designed to clean up  a 500-mile span of Highway 93 and involved  1,100 scouts. Since the first project was com pleted, the clean up has grown to include  cleaning highways, parks, campgrounds and  many other public areas  throughout  the  entire  state  and has brought an untold  number of civic organizations to help  the  boys with this tremendous project. During  the 5 years of it's existence, Project ""Good  Turn"" has  removed  approximately  5,000  tons of  trash from our public  lands. The  service project has raised public interest in  the condition of our land and has enhanced  the beauty of Montana, promoted recycling,  and has given the young boys a new pride in  their State. Since youth are our future, we  hope to implant in them an attitude of stew ardship and responsibility for the natural  resources in America.  We have received significant support from  the Governor's office,  the Montana State  Highway Patrol, the Montana Sheriff's and  Peace Officer's Association, the state Ama teur Radio Club, the Montana State Depart ment of Highways, and many other organi zations who helped support the project in  various capacities.  The project has been extremely successful  since it's conception, we have been chosen  ",1990
28,245,1,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay tribute to my dear friend, Al Teglia, on the  occasion of this retirement after 371/2 years of  loyal and  dedicated  service  to  the Mateo  Union High School District. Al has been oper ations manager, and he holds  the  longest  tenure in the school district. His service to the  schools of San Mateo County represents the  highest and finest tradition of public service.  Mr. Speaker, Al Teglia was born in the city  of Colma  in San Mateo County of Genoese  immigrant parents in 1931. He grew up in Daly  City, attended Jefferson High School and then  the College of San Mateo. Upon graduation  he began work with  the San Mateo Union  High School District.  Al has served the people of our peninsula in  a number of key posts. He has been elected a  Daly City Councilman for three terms, and he  held the office of Daly City mayor three times.  Al  is a member of  the San Mateo Council  Transportation Authority, the SamTrans Board  of Director, and numerous other boards and  commissions serving the citizens of our penin sula. He also was elected to three terms as  members of the board of trustees of Jefferson  Union High School,  president of  the San  Mateo County School Boards Association, and  delegate  to  the assembly of  the California  School Boards Association. Al  T eglia  has  served  our  peninsula  community  on  the  boards of  the San Mateo County Historical  Society, the Daly City-Colma Historical Socie ty,  the San Mateo County Arts Council and  many other organizations.  In 1988, he received  the Columbus Award  of  the San Mateo County  Italian American  Federation, and  in 1985 was given  the Hu manitarian-of-the-Year Award  from  the San  Mateo County Easter Seal Society. He has  been honored by  the Daly City Jaycees,  the  Hispanic Concilio of San Mateo County and a  number of other community groups and orga nizations.  Mr. Speaker,  I invite my colleagues  in  the  Congress to  join me  in paying well-deserved  243  tribute  to my constituent and dear  friend, Al  Teglia, on the occasion of his retirement from  the San Mateo Union High School District.  It  is also our sincere hope, however, that Al will  continue his dedicated and active involvement  in community service for the residents of our  peninsula.  TRIBUTE TO DR. RALPH WYATT  ADAMS  HON. WILLIAM L. DICKINSON  OF ALABAMA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 23, 1990  ",1990
29,245,1,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr. Speaker, as we move  into the new year, I would like to note the ac complishments of a special Alabamian who  retired  in 1989, Dr. Ralph Wyatt Adams of  Troy, AL.  Born on June 4, 1915, at Samson, AL, Dr.  Ralph Adams received his A.B. degree  from  Birmingham-Southern College, then the LLB.,  LLD., and J.D. degrees from the University of  Alabama. He  is married  to Dorothy Kelly  Adams and they have three grown children.  On September 1, 1989, Dr. Ralph Adams  retired  from  the duties of both president of  Troy State University and chancellor of  the  Troy State University  system. He  had  as sumed  the duties of president of Troy State  University on October 1, 1964, after complet ing a  long, honorable  tour of duty with  the  U.S. Air Force,  the U.S. Air Force Reserve,  and  the Alabama Air National Guard. He re tired  from  the military as a major general on  June 3, 1975.  Dr. Adams served under President John F.  Kennedy as head of  the Alabama Selective  Service System,  then under President Gerald  R. Ford as a member of his Presidential Clem ency Board. He has also served as chairman  of the council of presidents for the Alabama  Commission on Higher Education,  the Ala bama State Personnel Board, and  the Ala bama State  Insurance Board. He has also  served as president of the Alabama Associa tion  of College  and University Presidents.  Indeed, a  list of his positions of responsible  leadership could be continued at great length.  Through his performance as a community  and academic leader, Dr. Ralph Wyatt Adams  has distinguished himself by securing many  noteworthy honors. He was Man of the Year  for Troy, AL (in both 1968 and 1975); distin guished alumnus of Birmingham-Southern Col lege in 1978, and designated one of the top  100 Most Effective College Presidents by the  Exxon Education Foundation in 1986. For his  dedication  to  the enhancement of the multi cultural education program on his campus at  Troy State University, Dr. Adams received the  Order of the Rising Sun from the Government  of Japan in May 1989.  Dr. Adams has attracted many scholars of  international acclaim  to address Troy State  University students, and through his close as sociation with the English-Speaking Union, Dr.  Adams was named  to  the National Board of  Directors of the English-Speaking Union in the  USA. Ever since 1972, Troy State University  has provided a full 1-year scholarship to a stu dent from England. The criteria for receipt of  ",1990
30,258,1,Mr. MINETA.," Mr. Speaker, this past decade  has seen a desire  to  review and reconsider  some momentous events which occurred 48  years ago. Given this Nation's common thirst  for the future and disinterest in the past, such  a reconsideration is as unique as it is fruitful.  These events of a previous generation were  powerful  enough  to  pull  the  attention  of  today's historians, lawmakers, civil libertarians,  and artists. As a result, we are now  taking  steps to redress some wrongs committed long  ago and thus to reaffirm our great Constitution  and the freedoms guaranteed therein.  Our reflections on the past must include ac knowledgement of  those  few who had  the  vision and strength, when these wrongs were  executed, to stand up in protest. George Knox  Roth was one of this small group. He, and a  few  others,  spoke  out  and  fallowed  their  hearts and  their principles,  rather  than  the  winds of popularity. They suffered  for  their  stand.  On February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt  signed Executive Order 9066, which was  to  lead to the wholesale abrogation of civil rights  of thousands of loyal Americans of Japanese  ancestry. These acts and the tragedies which  thus resulted were the result of wartime hyste ria,  racial prejudice, and a failure of political  leadership.  At  the  time of  the evacuation and  intern ment of  this group of  loyal Americans,  few  voices were. raised  in protest. Often,  those  who spoke in favor of the freedom and rights  of Americans of Japanese ancestry and of  their belief in the loyalty of these hard-working  citizens were  themselves ostracized as were  those of Japanese ancestry. George Knox  Roth spoke out, and saw his personal life de stroyed.  Such a stigma can cling  for years. many  years. To this day I receive mail from people  who have not yet realized  the difference be tween Americans of Japanese ancestry and a  long-gone government of Japan. These letters  still attempt to place a stigma on  the shoul ders of Americans of Japanese ancestry.  The costs of such senseless prejudice are  high-to the people ostracized as well as  to  those others who spoke out for justice. Our  Nation, however, pays the highest price of all  through  the  loss of human  resources,  ideas  and contributions. We pay the price in the ero sion of progress toward  the  ideals which we  seek and in the undermining of the institutions  and principles on which our Nation is built.  January 23, 1990  Mr. Speaker, we should be especially grate ful to those voices who struggled for what was  right. We must recognize their cries for justice,  cries unclouded by fear, or anger, or ambition.  It has taken many years for this Nation to  face up to a shameful wrong. But only by ad mitting this wrong can we begin to hope that  such a tragedy never again occurs.  On March 9, George Knox Roth will be 83  years old. I ask my colleagues to join me in a  salute  to George and  to his  leadership. His  stand caused him  to suffer many sacrifices  over  the  years. We  cannot  rectify  those  losses, but we can thank him for his unwaver ing vision. Without the efforts of men like him,  the tragedy of the evacuation and internment  would never have been redressed.  Thank you.  NEW YEAR ADDRESS OF CZECH OSLOVAK PRESIDENT VACLAV  HAVEL  HON. TOM LANTOS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 23, 1990  ",1990
31,258,1,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, the highlight of  my recent visit to Europe with members of the  U.S. congressional delegation to the European  Parliament was our meeting with  the new  President of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel.  As my colleagues know Vaclav Havel has  been a beacon for human rights in Czechoslo vakia since the Charter 77 human rights orga nization was first organized  in January 1977.  This year, Havel was one of the key  individ uals who led Czechoslovakia from totalitarian  dictatorship toward democracy. Thanks to his  inspiring  leadership  of  the  Civic  Forum,  Czechoslovakia's  ""Velvet Revolution""  trans formed the country.  Mr. Speaker, the people of Czechoslovakia  are fortunate  indeed to have a man of such  stature,  integrity, and commitment to democ racy and human rights.  leading  them at  this  critical time in their history.  As  the new year began,  just a  few days  after Vaclav Havel  took office, he delivered  the traditional new year's address. Mr. Speak er,  I ask  that President Havel's address be  placed  in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. His  realism, commitment to democracy and plural ism,  and  his dedication  to  the  people of  Czechoslovakia  is something  that all of us  should share.  OUR FREEDOM  Dear fellow citizens: For the past 40 years  on this day you have heard my predecessors  utter  different  variations  on  the  same  theme, about how our country is prospering,  how many more billion tons of steel we have  produced, how happy we all are, how much  we trust our government and what beautiful  prospects lie ahead of us. I do not think you  put me  into  this office so  that I, of all  people, should also lie to you.  Our country is not prospering. The great  creative  and  spiritual  potential  of  our  nation is not being used to its full potential.  Whole  sectors of  industry are producing  things in which no one is interested, while  the things we need are in short supply.  ",1990
32,271,1,Mr. HUBBARD.," Mr. Speaker,  it is my privi lege  to  pay  tribute  to  a  long-time  friend,  Arnold L. Hudgens, who died January 5 at age  76 at Community Hospital in Mayfield, KY.  Mr. Hudgens, a beloved and highly respect ed Bardwell, KY, resident, was a former sheriff  of Carlisle County, the father-in-law of the Car lisle County superintendent of schools, Robert  Edward Watson of Bardwell,  a veteran of  World War  II  and  a member of Bardwell  United Methodist Church.  Mr. Hudgens, who was affectionately  re ferred  to as  ""Shug"" by  friends, was always  very helpful to those of us who called on him  for assistance. Shug Hudgens and his family  were very helpful  to me as early as 1967  when I was a 29-year-old candidate for State  senator. He was preceded  in death by his  lovely and  talented wife, Martha Turner Hud gens.  Surviving  are  three  daughters,  Brenda  Watson and Ann Carter, both of Bardwell, and  Phyllis Hughes of Virginia; a son, Joe Hud gens of Bardwell; a sister, Mona Coil of Padu cah, and several grandchildren.  My wife Carol and I extend to the family of  Arnold L. Hudgens our sympathy.  TRIBUTE TO CPL. IV.AND. PEREZ  HON. CLAUDINE SCHNEIDER  OF RHODE ISLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 23, 1990  ",1990
33,271,1,Ms. SCHNEIDER.," Mr .. Speaker, Cpl.  Ivan  Perez of Pawtucket, RI, died a hero's death in  combat. He paid the highest price and made  the ultimate sacrifice  for  the United States.  We owe him an eternal debt of gratitude.  In the early morning hours of December 20,  1989, Corporal Perez rode into battle. He was  in the first Bravo Company platoon to attack  General Noriega's headquarters-the Coman dancia. During  the ensuing  firefight, Perez,  who manned the .50 caliber machinegun atop  an armored personnel carrier, was killed  in  combat. His bravery helped our Armed Forces  to quickly knock out Noriega's headquarters  and neutralize any organized opposition.  Our gratitude  to Corporal Perez  is strong  and unquestioned. However,  Ivan Perez won  the gratitude of another set of people: The  Panamanians.  During  my  recent  trip  to  Panama,  I saw firsthand the ravages of Gen eral Noriega and felt the palpable relief of the  Panamanian people. Ivan Perez was a libera tor-he died so that millions could live without  tyranny.  Today, I am introducing a bill to make Cor poral Perez an American citizen. I understand  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  that Corporal Perez planned to apply for citi zenship upon leaving the Armed Forces. I feel  that it is the least we can do to make him a  citizen posthumously.  Today, I salute Cpl. Ivan D. Perez as a great  American and a fellow Rhode  Islander. May  his memory live forever.  CITIZENS FEDERAL SAVINGS:  THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT S&L'S  HON. WILLIAM LEHMAN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 23, 1990  ",1990
34,271,1,Mr. LEHMAN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, if all  savings and  loans were operated  like  the  Miami-based Citizens Federal Savings,  there  wouldn't be a need for bailout bills and crimi nal prosecutions.  Founded by my old  friend,  the  late David  Stuzin and brilliantly guided through the past  turbulent decade by his son Charles, Citizens  Federal has enjoyed several years of profit ability; successful expansion  into markets  in  states outside Florida; and a capital  reserve  that exceeds Federal standards by one  third  at a time when a quarter of all U.S. thrifts are  unable to meet the minimum.  The Miami Herald  recently  profiled  this  Miami institution and its remarkable CEO, and  I would like to commend this artiCle to the at tention of my colleagues.  During  these days of  savings  and  loan  scandals, closings and failures, Citizens Fed eral should be a model for every savings and  loan.  [From the Miami Herald, Jan. 15, 1990]  THE Goon CITIZENS  (By Gregg Fields)  Was  there  ever  a  better  citizen  than  Jimmy Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life?  He was a  tireless community worker. He  was a selfless civic booster. He was-gasp!-a  savings and loan executive.  an S&L executive himself, Charles  Stuzin hasn't found the public to have such  warm  regard  for  thrift executives  lately,  however.  ""So after I  tell them I'm a thrift execu tive, I tell them I'm also a lawyer,"" chuckles  Stuzin, chairman of Miami's Citizens Feder al Savings.  In realjty, if there are worthy successors  to  Stewart's mythical  legacy,  they  are  Stuzin and Citizens Federal, say competi tors, analysts and former co-workers.  Citizens is boasting seven years of improv ing operating profits in an era when even  healthy  savings  associations  are  losing  money.  It surpasses new  federal  capital  standards by a  third at a  time when 760  thrifts-a fourth of  the U.S.  total-can't  meet the minimum. It is looking expansively  toward  the future at a  time when many  S&Ls are trying frantically to lop off the  excesses of the past.  The key to success: In the 1980s, Citizens  went against the grain and stayed conserva tive.  Instead of entering bidding wars for  consumer deposits, it quietly sought inves tors seeking unexciting but safe  returns.  When  thrifts  from  around  the  country  spent enormous sums of money  to enter  Florida, Citizens expanded in the unglamor ous Midwest.  As  269  Perhaps most significantly, as S&Ls were  buying  junk bonds and building country  clubs, Citizens stuck stubbornly to the basi cally dull business of home loans.  ""In an industry that's collapsing, Charlie  Stuzin  is a  real beacon,"" says Bill Allen,  chairman of Citizens competitor Atico Sav ings. ""He's gone out and made money the  old-fashioned way. And  his  integrity  is  beyond reproach.""  Along the way, Stuzin became a national  figure within his industry. It is an industry  whose foundations are being badly shaken,  he concedes. ""I think half the thrift indus try will disappear,"" he says. ""I'm talking  about the healthy ones.""  When asked whether Citizens will be a  survivor, or an acquisition, he shrugs. ""Inde pendence isn't important.""  A FATHER'S ADVICE  Independence was  important  to Stuzin's  late father, David. An accountant by trade,  he moved from New York City  to South  Florida and becatne a bank auditor.  ""He  realized  there weren't  that many  S&Ls, and  there were none  in Hialeah,""  says his widow, Ruth. Stuzin got his federal  charter in 1952, setting up shop in Hialeah.  ""At that  time, building was beginning to  boom,""  recalls Ruth Stuzin.  ""He  always  said, 'Don't forget the purpose of the busi ness: hotne loans.' ""  The family still owns 44 percent of the  company.  The younger Stuzin was interested in the  business. Dad decided he should  learn  it  from the ground floor. ""I started when I  was 15 as a teller,"" says Charles Stuzin. ""I  worked in every department. That's how I  learned the basics.""  An accounting degree from the University  of Florida polished his numbers knowledge.  A law degree, with a specialty in real estate,  gave him insight into home lending.  DEREGULATION STRATEGIES  But nothing could have prepared him for  the thrift industry crisis of the mid-1980s,  Stuzin says. In the early 1980s, market con ditions  forced S&Ls  to pay high  interest  rates on deposits while  they earned  low  yields  on  fixed-rate  mortgages.  Losses  ensued.  Citizens survived, but a fourth of Florida's  S&Ls didn't.  In the mid-1980s, empowered by deregula tion, many S&Ls voluntarily bid up rates on  deposits because they could now pump the  deposit money  into high-interest commer cial loans rather than mortgages.  The  problem: High-interest  loans  made to less creditworthy customers.  Citizens saw disaster looming. ""The indus try was paying  too much  for deposits,""  Stuzin said. ""That means you've got to get  higher rates on your loans to earn a profit.  And that means you have to make riskier  loans.''  The dilemma: Citizens couldn't afford to  bid for deposits, but it couldn't afford not  to. No thrift can survive without new depos its.  are  A SHIFT TO INVESTORS  With regulators' blessings, Stuzin found a  solution. Rather than take money in from  consumers, he turned to investors.

35,284,1,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, it was  my profound pleasure to be among the  guests invited to the inauguration of  L. Douglas Wilder as Governor of the  Commonwealth of Virginia on Satur day, January 13.  That gathering was, indeed a histor ic occasion in the history of my State  in The History of the American politi cal system. All who attended the cere mony  were  moved  by  Governor  Wilder's remarks.  I was particularly impressed by the  Governor's  pledge  to  demonstrate  during the next 4 years that he will be  beholden to but one special interest:  The welfare of Virginians, all Virgin ians.  I  wish Governor Wilder  success  during his tenure. For, as I  told him  that day, to the extent he succeeds, all  Virginians succeed.  Mr. President, it is my pleasure to  ask unanimous consent that the text  of Governor Wilder's excellent inaugu ral address be printed in the RECORD at  the conclusion of Senator ROBB'S re marks.

37,284,1,Mr. ROBB.," Mr. President, it is with  a great deal of pleasure that I  join  with my  distinguished  senior  col league, Senator WARNER,  in  asking  that  the  remarks of Virginia's new  Governor on the occasion of his inau guration be included in the RECORD.  January 13, 1990, was a great day for  the Commonwealth of Virginia and for  the Nation. Much has been made of  the historic aspect of the event, and to  be sure that day marks an important  milestone  in  this Nation's progress.  But  I  see  the election of Lawrence  Douglas Wilder as the 66th Governor  of Virginia as the natural and logical  extension  of  Thomas  Jefferson's  notion of an aristocracy of merit, as  Virginians proved once again that we  look to the most qualified, most expe rienced individual to lead us.  Senator WARNER and I were present  as Governor Wilder delivered his inau gural address. We commend it to you  for its reflection of the sweep of histo ry which led to the particular moment  and its appreciation of the challenges  that Virginia and the Nation face as  the 20th century comes to a close. I  am  happy  to  join with  Senator  WARNER in asking that it be reprinted  in the RECORD.  EXHIBIT No. 1  TEXT OF GOVERNOR WILDER'S INAUGURAL  ADDRESS DELIVERED AT THE CAPITOL  <Following is the text of Gov. L. Douglas  Wilder's inaugural address>  Mr. Justice Powell, Mr. Justice Carrico, to  the  lieutenant governor,  to  the attorney  general, members of the General Assembly,  distinguished  guests,  family  and  friends,  and my fellow Viginians, we gather here  today for what is both a culmination and a  continuation of the democratic process.  Four years ago,  I stood on this spot to  assume  the second highest office  in  the  commonwealth. Today,  because  of  your  faith in our efforts, I stand before you as  chief executive of this state. And now-in  keeping with  the sanctioned privilege ex tended to all governors-it is my honor to  address the people of this commonwealth,  and to express to my fellow citizens the pro found gratitude and deep sense of purpose  that I feel in fulfilling your expectations.  Candor and honesty would have me admit  to you that I was not blessed with the fore sight to know that this moment was in the  offing when I stood here in 1985. Having  been tested in the political crucible of trial  and cross-examination,  I  have been  ren dered a verdict by having had delivered unto  me the greatest outpouring of votes ever ac corded any candidate for this great office.  For that, I shall be eternally grateful. And be assured-I shall demonstrate that grati tude during the next four years by being a  governor who will be beholden to but one  special interest: the welfare of Virginians,  all Virginians.  ""THE BEST OF MY ABILITIES""  But my gratitude  is not of such recent  origin. It is said ""To whom much is given,  much shall be expected."" I will be the first  to admit that I have been the beneficiary of  much  through no endeavors of my own.  While I have indeed worked hard and per formed to the best of my abilities, I have  also had a few breaks along the way.  Indeed in every walk-in every period of  my life-there have been many more deserv ing and  justly entitled to  the fruits  that  wholesome opportunities present. And yet,  for many, those chances never came and the  bell of fulfillment never  tolled for  them.  Providence indeed has directed my course.  And I shall remain ever mindful of my good  fortune.  In recent years, Virginia  too has been  blessed with good fortune. The progress and  the prosperity we have enjoyed during this  period has enabled us  to reclaim  the re spected achievements of times past.  In looking to our accomplishments in edu cation, economic development, the environ ment, employment, housing or transporta tion, we  find  that Virginia  ranks among  those states  in  the vanguard of  forward  looking movement. Not surprisingly, the en suing pride in seeing our state climb in rank  among our sister states in the nation and in  preeminence among  the Southern states,  cause Virginians everywhere  to  feel good  about our cause, our mission, and our suc cess in forging Virginia's New Mainstream.  COMMITMENT TO LOOK AHEAD  That commitment to looking ahead and  not behind-of building  rather  than destroying; of bringing people together rather  than pitting them against each other-also  calls for me to address you with measured  sobriety in facing conditions in the common wealth today, and I will comment further in  that regard when I address the General As sembly on Monday.  But for this moment, let me assure you  that I do not intend to participate in bring ing  to  a  halt  the momentum  to which  people of Virginia have grown accustomed,  supported and enjoyed.  Cicero in parting observation, noted that,  ""A commonwealth is not any collection of  human  beings ... but  an  assembly  of  people joined in agreement on justice and  partnership for  the common good, and a  community where civility must reign and all  must  live  peacefully  together."" And we  know what happened  to Cicero's Rome  which could not pass on the heritage of its  past to the people of its future. But we have  done so; we can do so. And we shall do so.  There are times when the people of our  state and of our country can feel the resur gence of the dominance of the  individual  spirit which proves daily to be unconquer able. Whirlwinds  of  rebellion  shake  all  shores where  tyranny once ruled, and we  are redeemed in our deeply held and treas ured beliefs in the development of the high  possibility of every individual who breathes  the sweetness of liberty's air.  At this time-and in the place where so  many great names in American history have  trod-we renew this celebration of freedom  in the full and certain knowledge that with  it comes great responsibility.  Without question, much tighter economic  times which loom in the days ahead will test  to the fullest our ability to make hard deci sions, to lead, and to govern.  INCREASED FREEDOM  But progress will be possible.  Opportunity can be expanded.  Freedom can be increased.  Resources employed in the past for the  finer things in life can be-and will have to  be-deployed for  the more serious of our  needs.  For we know that freedom is but a word  for  the man or woman who needs and  cannot find a job.  Freedom-as  it has been written-is  a  dream deferred when 'it ""Dries up  like a  raisin  in  the sun, and stinks  like  rotten  meat.""  Freedom is meaningless when a woman's  right to choose is regulated outside the dic tates of her own faith and conscience.  Freedom is impotent when there is intol erance to those who hold moral and politi cal beliefs different from our own.  Freedom  is  restricted when  labor and  management cannot reach agreements.  Freedom is impossible for the uneducated  who try to live in today's complex world.  Freedom is restrained for business and in dustry when our network of transportation  is allowed to deteriorate.  Freedom for  the police  is denied when  their resources are unduly limited.  Freedom for the people is assaulted when  lawful authority is abused.  Freedom for the next generation is mort gaged when we destroy our environment.  And-as has been proven throughout re corded history-freedom is nowhere to be  found when the people are overtaxed and  overregulated.  As we salute the idea of freedom today, let  us pledge to extend that same freedom to  others tomorrow.  ",1990

41,310,1,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, I have  consulted with the distinguished man ager of the bill, and, at the moment,  there are no other speakers on the  Clean Air Act. I understand the Sena tor from Michigan CMr. LEVIN] will be  on the floor very shortly to do so.  Mr. President, while on the floor, I  have  been  listening  to  the  distin guished Senator from Connecticut in  his statement, and I must say, very de tailed statement, relative to the Clean  Air Act.  I would like to take this time to com pliment  this  individual Senator. For  many, many years he has been  in volved in this fight in his home State  and now as a Member of  the U.S.  Senate.  I  compliment  him  on  his  knowledge and also on his very, very  fine presentation.  In addition, I compliment the distin guished Senator from North Dakota  [Mr. BURDICK],  the chairman of the  committee, where this legislation origi nated.  I  compliment, as did  the Senator  from Connecticut,  the distinguished  majority leader, Senator MITCHELL, for  his long fight in this effort and who  ultimately has seen his dream become  a reality. It is now on the Senate floor.  It is being debated.  No one could have been chosen who  would be better qualified than the dis tinguished  Senator  from Montana  [Mr. BAucus] to handle this very com plex, lengthy, and, I must say, contro versial piece of legislation.  Approximately 1 year ago, I had the  privilege  of  traveling with Senator  BAUCUS. I asked Senator BAUCUS what  he was reading. It appeared to me to  be about an 18-pound notebook. He  said, ""I am preparing and studying for  the debate on the Clean Air Act.""  I doubt there are many more emo tional  issues  that have come before  the Senate and once again to work out  the various  interests and  to handle  each State's and each region's various  problems as we go into the full-scale  debate on  the Clean Air Act. Once  again,  there  is no one more highly  qualified,  more  knowledgeable  or  better suited to deal with this issue  than my.friend, the distinguished Sen ator from Montana.  A PEOPLE'S CORPS  ",1990
42,310,1,Mr.  PRYOR.," Mr.  President,  in  recent weeks awesome global changes  that we have witnessed have given rise  to a new phrase  in  this body,  the  ""peace dividend."" Only weeks ago we  were not even thinking about such a  possibility. Now it has become a part  of congressional and public vocabu lary.  The  distinguished  Republican  leader, Senator DOLE, has  in recent  days thrown out an idea of cutting the  top five recipients of our foreign aid  program and sending the 5 percent to  Eastern Europe. The President only  this morning in his press conference  discussed aid to Panama. Poland and  Hungary have already been targeted  to receive American foreign aid.  Mr. President, I rise this morning to  say that we should be very cautious  about starting new programs of mas sive foreign aid to these newly liberat ed countries. Even as good or altruistic  as our motive may be, I fear our infu sion of dollars at this time is prema ture and possibly will contribute  to  the instability of the present unstable  political environment in  those coun tries.  Most of  these countries have yet  even  to adopt a  constitution. Their  knowledge of writing the basic rules  and laws has not yet been tested. A  plan of distribution of American aid,  priorities of need and assistance of  seeing our dollars hitting the target, is  today nonexistent. We as a country do  not have the money. Akin to revenue  sharing, there is no revenue to share.  Today with America's elation  and  hopes for a new world, there is also  some frustration. We as a people want  to make a positive response. We want  to extend our hand in friendship and  share with Eastern Europeans  the  blessings of  liberty. The question  is  how do we do it?  Yes, we do have a deficit of dollars,  but we do have a  surplus of good  Americans who  are willing  to  give  their  time,  their  resources,  their  wisdom and skills  in sharing, volun teers, Americans from all walks of life.  In the past weeks, in my home State  of Arkansas, when I stated over and  over again that we should send people  not dollars,  the  response was  truly  overwhelming, personifying,  I  think,  American generosity at its best. A den tist in Benton, AR, said, ""Here is my  card.  I will give  a year."" A  school  teacher came up to me in Little Rock  and said, ""Senator PRYOR, let me give  a semester."" An engineer in Jackson ville  said,  ""Put me  down  for  6  months."" An irrigation expert in Pine  Bluff said, ""Please let me go.""  There are hundreds, of retired citi zens  throughout America who thirst  once again for additional challenges.  We should tap that resource. Today  there is an army of Americans with  big hearts, special skills to share. They  are ready, they are willing, and they  are able  to become a peoples corps,  representing the best of what America  is all about.  Senator GORTON yesterday on  the  Senate  floor  touched  on  such  a  thought. It is truly a concept which all  of us should explore. Let us encourage  the  leaders of business, of  industry.  Let us call upon organizations who  represent agriculture. Let us take the  various professions or ask the various  professions to become a part of a true  American experience of sharing.  We do not need governments or bu reaucracies or bureaucrats  to  inter vene and confuse. We do not need mis guided dollars being sent to Eastern  Europe. What we do need is Americans  to help make their dream become to morrow's reality.  ",1990
43,362,1,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, I wish  to bring to the attention of my col leagues an article on the sugar indus try which appeared in the December I  January issue of Farmline, a U.S. De partment of Agriculture publication of  the Economic Research Service. We so  frequently read attacks on the sugar  program from both within and outside  our Government by people who have  very limited knowledge of the program  and the industry. It is indeed refresh ing to find a balanced and informative  article from an authoritative source.  As you know, the 1990 farm bill will  be before us this year. The sugar pro gram is an essential part of the farm  bill and I am confident that your un derstanding of the need for and the  merits of  that program will be en hanced by  reading  this article. Mr.  President, I hereby request that it be  placed in the RECORD.  The article follows:  [From Farmline, December 1989-January  1990]  SUGAR PRODUCERS, USERS COULD GAIN A  FAIRER MARKETPLACE  Trade barriers that have long protected  the sugar  industry worldwide and  in  the  United States are being reevaluated, both in  the U.S. Congress and in the 97-nation Gen eral Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  CGATT). The outcome may  be  a  freer  market for the heavily traded commodity.  Sugar, produced in about 100 countries, is  one of the world's most traded and protect ed  food commodities, says economist An nette Clauson of USDA's Economic Re search Service. Sugar  is an  ingredient  in  most food items and plans an essential role  in the food chain. It is also an important  source of revenue to most countries. There fore,  the concern  for, and protection of,  sugar is worldwide.  ""Most major  sugar-producing  countries  maintain more than one sugar policy to pro tect  their producers and consumers  from  market price fluctuations,"" says the econo mist. Such programs include domestic and  import price controls, export controls and  subsidies, minimum prices to farmers, and  production quotas. The current U.S. sugar  program  includes  import controls and  a  minimum price to producers.  ""Sugar, historically, has been one of the  most volatile of all commodity markets,""  says Clauson. For example, monthly world  raw sugar prices have ranged from 2. 7 cents  to 41.1 cents per pound in the 1980's. ""When  supplies are low, prices rise sharply, impact ing consumers. Conversely, when supplies  are high, prices are severely depressed, im pacting producers. One factor that cannot  be controlled is the weather, making har vested acreage, yields, and sugar recovery  rates unpredictable from year to year,"" says  the economist.  ERS analysts say that quotas <restricted  imports> are necessary to protect domestic  sugar  producers  from  competition with  world sugar when prices are depressed. The  U.S. program maintains a domestic price for  raw sugar high enough to avoid defaults on  processors' Commodity Credit Corporation  c CCC) loans.  ""Only about a quarter of world sugar is  traded  in  international markets, and an  even smaller amount, about 15 percent, is  currently traded at world prices. This is an  important point, since many people believe  that unlimited quantities of sugar can be  bought at  the  'world price.'  In  reality,  world-priced sugar is a small uncommitted  amount that is sold for whatever price it  might bring,"" says Clauson.  Consumers pay the cost of world sugar  protection at different rates, depending on  where purchases are made. Little of  the  sugar traded in the world market is sold at  world market prices, says Clauson. Almost  all is sold at prices reflecting the domestic  sugar policies of the trading countries.  For example, according to a survey con ducted by U.S. agricultural attaches in 1988,  sugar prices varied  significantly  in  each  country.  In Canada, where world market  sugar is available, the government provides  a guaranteed return to growers in the form  of income support payments. Retail prices  in Ottawa were  low, about 17  cents per  pound, although prices varied and averaged  29 cents a pound in other cities, according to  a Canadian  government  survey. At  the  other end of the spectrum, in Japan, which  has substantial duties, sugar sold at 89 cents  a pound. The U.S. maintains a price support  program protected by  import quotas, and  the price to consumers in 1988 averaged 38  cents per pound.  Sugar-exporting nations  have  criticized  the United States for maintaining its sugar import restrictions, including a formal chal lenge brought by Australia  through  the  GATT dispute settlement process against  the allegedly  improper  implementation of  U.S. import quotas. The European Commu nity also filed a complaint through the same  GATT process against the United States for  its use of the Section 22 authority of the  Agricultural Adjustment Act  of 1933  to  impose import restrictions on sugar-contain ing products.  IMPLICATIONS OF GA'IT PROPOSALS  GA TT negotiators have debated proposals  to restructure and decrease trade distorting  agricultural subsidies. In April 1989, GATT  negotiators reached framework agreement.  Clauson says that although no major issues  were resolved, the language appears flexible  and strong enough to suggest substantive  long-term  reductions  in  import barriers,  supports, and subsidies.  The framework agreement did not include  specific language on the level of reductions  or a schedule for such reductions. Since ag riculture will be one of the toughest resolu tion areas, says Clauson, trade negotiators  are expected to propose more specific inten tions by January 1, 1990. Trade negotiators  plan to discuss long-term reform proposals  and complete the negotiations by late No vember or early December 1990 in the Uru guay round.  Clauson points out that the language on  import access and support  levels  in  the  framework  agreement works within  the  scope of  its members' existing legislation,  and their existing rights and obligations as  members of GATT. For the short term the  language of the agreement ensures that:  ""Current domestic and export support and  protection levels are not exceeded, except as  required by current law.""  For the United States, the current 18-cent  per pound loan rate specified in the 1985  farm bill could not be increased and addi tional  protection measures  and  import  quota  restrictions  could  not  be  added,  except under existing legislation.  Clauson explains that the U.S. sugar pro gram offers nonrecourse loans for raw cane  sugar and refined beet sugar. A price objec tive, called the Market Stabilization Price,  and the quotas on imported sugar allow a  domestic price  to be maintained that en courages processors to redeem loan collater al, rather than to forfeit the sugar to the  federal government.  ""Participants shall be deemed  to be  in  compliance with this undertaking so long as  the access opportunities granted to individ ual products in 1989 and 1990 are not less  than those granted in 1987 and 1988.''  Clauson says the wording is unclear on  whether the intent is the maximum, mini mum, or some average. If some averaging  method is used, the U.S. raw /refined sugar  import quota levels in 1989 and 1990 would  not be reduced below  the combined 1987  level of 1.0 million short tons and the 1988  level of 1.06 million short tons. The escape  clause, ""within the scope of existing legisla tion,"" permits reduction of the import quota  level  if necessary  to avoid  forfeitures of  sugar to the CCC.  ""Support  prices  to  producers  are  not  raised above the level prevailing at the date  of this decision.""  This means that the 18-cent loan rate for  sugar cannot be increased in the short term.  Changes in support limitations and access  restrictions beyond 1990 will likely be dictat ed by the Uruguay round.  One of the changes in import quotas of  sugar committed to the United States was  announced in September 1989. The quota  ",1990

46,375,1,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President, I rise  today in support of S. 1046, the Merri mack River Study Act of 1989. Senate  approval of this bill will be a major  step in the direction of long-term pro tection for  this remarkable river re source, which begins in Franklin, NH,  at the confluence of the Pemigewasset  and Winnepesaukee Rivers and flows  southward into eastern Massachusetts  to the Atlantic Ocean. Passage of S.  1046 will be a major victory for the  communities who organized to protect  the river from encroaching develop ment. As part of a 2-year effort, the  Merrimack River Coordinating Com mittee. working with all local commu nities and the various interests, built a  consensus on the long-term protection  of the Merrimack. The legislation we  are considering today represents that  consensus. This measure has the sup port of Governor Gregg and all the  communities along the proposed study  segment.  I want to thank the Senate Energy  and Natural Resources Committee for  taking rapid action on this measure. I  would also like to express my apprecia tion for the work of the chairman and  ranking member of the Subcommittee  on Public Lands, Senators BUMPERS  and WALLOP.  I ask unanimous consent to have a  letter from the mayor of Concord, NH,  ",1990
47,427,1,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank my leader for yielding me the  time. I am going to vote to override  the  President's veto  today.  I  an nounced  that last week.  I  feel  that  Members do have a constitutional obli gation to do that.  I  am also going  to vote  for  the  motion of the gentleman from Illinois  CMr. MICHEL]. I want to explain brief ly why  I  think  it  is  reasonable  to  spend a week or two asking the Com mittee on Foreign Affairs and  the  Committee on Intelligence and other  committees to review things.  I found myself just as we prepared  to come back home and we were all  out around the country, we were look ing around and talking to people. As I  sat in Douglasville, GA, in Carrollton,  GA, in Jonesboro, GA, I had a chance  after Christmas to listen to people.  Then I said, now we are all going to  come to Washington. It suddenly oc curred  to me one afternoon, and  I  think this is an important thing for  Congress to realize, that the world had  changed dramatically  since we  left  here in November. Romania had lost  its dictatorship in an extraordinarily  bloody cycle of events. The Soviet  Empire changed substantially. The Az erbaijani rebellion all occurred since  then.  The  process  of  change  in  Panama had been decisive with an  American victory and a victory  for  freedom and against the drug dealers.  Place after place around the planet,  things changed.  In China there is a process going on.  I thought what could better illustrate  the willful ignorance of Congress than  to  rush  back  to Washington,  and  within 24 hours of arriving, decide  that it could not stop and investigate,  it could not have closed hearings to re ceive any testimony by the administra tion, it could not contemplate; but in stead, relying on newspaper reports,  relying on Christmas cards from Chi nese students, relying on the passions  of the moment as we remembered it  the day we left, when we voted.  There  is no question  in my mind  that the President has made a mis take. There is no question in my mind  that in fact if we are going to vote to  override the veto, it should be an over ride.  I  just found  it intriguing that we  had to schedule this the opening week  and that it had to be characterized by  some people as a partisan scheduling  on the part of the Democratic leader ship to score one on the President.  Let me just say two things in closing  about all this: In the first place, a man  with 80-percent approval can probably  be overridden and he will not be crip pled dramatically. He might shrink to  the levels of Roosevelt,  to the more  normal levels of Eisenhower and Roo sevelt. In the second place, we will not  dramatically change things.  I  just want  to note  for my col leagues, I hope the Democratic leader ship does not plan to start a whole  series of partisan snipings, of which  this week's schedule is an example. I  think it is regrettable that they pulled  the  resolution  on  Panama, which  should have been here and we under stood yesterday was going to be here. I  think that would have been bipartisan  and positive and the American people  would have supported it.  I think it is regrettable that it was  decided to schedule this, and that it  has been described so openly in the  press as a partisan effort.  So, Mr. Speaker, I am going to vote  for this motion on two grounds. First,  to send the signal that on an issue  that is still going to be relevant in 2  weeks, an issue where the President al ready personally by administrative fiat  has taken care of any concerns of the  students, has already protected them,  that it would not have been inappro priate for Congress to wait 2 weeks to  let  the committees  report. And  the  truth is the committees could not have  reported during  the previous period  because  they were not here. They  could not have gotten a quorum and  had a meeting.  Symbolically, first I think it is useful  for  the  legislature  to  try  to be  in formed occasionally, especially when  the world is changing as fast as it has  in the last 60 days.  Second, I want to send a message to  my friends in the Democratic leader ship. It is going to be a long season if  we get to petty partisanship, if we pull  a  resolution on Panama that should  have commended the President of the  United States, that should have ap plauded the men and women in uni form who did the right thing, if we  pull that and leave standing only a  veto override in the narrowest of parti san ways.  Mr. Speaker, I hope my friends on  the Republican side will vote for this  motion,  and  those Democrats who  think Congress should slow down and  take a look and get briefed occasional ly, they may want to vote this way too.

49,427,1,Mr. JONES of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  in these past few months we have seen  historic images of change and courage  and hope. We have seen the image of  free people celebrating on the ruins of  the Berlin wall. We have seen, too, the  image of a young Chinese man facing  a convoy of tanks in an act of defiance  that spoke for all mankind. And we  have seen the darker image of Ameri can diplomats lifting a cynical toast to  the brutal Communist ideologues who  had crushed  the  life out of  their  brightest children.  Today we have the opportunity to  create another  image-as we,  repre senting the sentiment of a Nation, reaffirm through law the basic decency  of the American people, and the basic  fairness of our moral imperative. Let  us send a clear and simple marker  about the American character to the  butchers of Beijing.  In doing so, we will also send to free dom  loving people  throughout  the  world  an  unequivocal message: we  stand for human rights. Let us def eat  the motion to refer,  let us override  this unfortunate veto, and let us lift  no more toasts to tyrants.  0 1520  ",1990

51,427,1,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the motion which I  think is well in tended and I understand the minority  whip's proposition that we could take  2 weeks  to  look at  this. There  is,  though, I believe no one in this body  who believes that looking at this in 2  weeks would change  the opinion of  any Member of this body who repre sents the people of this country who  were outraged,  justifiably so, by the  events in Tiananmen Square.  I suggest to you that perhaps people  told Andrei Sakharov to wait, take 2  weeks  to  consider whether human  rights violations were worth standing  up against. Perhaps the people in Ru mania were told that as well.  Vaclav Havel, who spent 5 years in  prison  in Czechoslovakia,  I am sure  was told many times, ""wait.""  It is time to act now, it is time, with  a clear and I hope unanimous voice,  state to  those in China as we have  done over and over again, not on a par tisan fashion but together, the Soviet  Union and  the Communist bloc  in  Europe, ""We stand in united opposi tion to violations of human rights in  the Soviet Union.""  Indeed  our  President,  President  Reagan  said  that  the  then Soviet  Union at the time he said it was the  evil empire. It is perhaps China that  now stands most dramatically in that  position.  This is not a time to temporize, this  is not a time to delay, it is a time to  act. Let us speak with a strong voice  and override this misguided veto.  ",1990

55,440,1,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  my  colleague,  the  gentleman  from  Texas [Mr. BROOKS], chairman of the  committee, for yielding  this  time  to  me, and also for his leadership in help ing to move this legislation forward. I  also  thank our colleague,  the chair man of the subcommittee, for his as sistance, and I thank the ranking Re publican member of the Committee on  the  Judiciary,  the gentleman  from  New York [Mr. FISH], for his assist ance as well. I extend my appreciation  to each and every one of our col leagues in the House who cosponsored  this legislation and who spoke out in  favor of this legislation.  I am very proud of it because it has  brought so many of us together in a  very bipartisan way. I think it is an ap propriate way  for us  to begin  this  second session of the lOlst Congress  for us to rise in support of this legisla tion.  When I came to the House of Repre sentatives, I was very proud to become  a Member and a colleague of each and  every one of you. I also thought each  and every one of us was a colleague of  everyone who served  in  this House  before us, taking us all the way back  to the origins of our Republic-those  people, many of whom fought for our  independence and helped give birth to  our democracy. And in a spirit of bi partisanship  that  stems  from  our  unity  around  the  idea  that we  all  stand  for  democractic  principles,  I  wanted to add to our pictures of our  Founding Fathers, George Washing ton on one side, and a friend of our  Republic,  the Marquis de Lafayette,  the one man 200 years later in the  square. Many of the speakers before  me have referred to him, and I think  so many Americans  identified with  him at the time, and still do.  On this painted picture, it says:  One man standing against madness kin dles anew the sparks of freedom and ele vates  the spirit of man. How can we not  stand with him?  D 1700  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this leg islation because I believe it gives the  Congress  the opportunity  to  stand  with him.  The question before the House  is,  ""Is the veto override necessary?"" I be lieve it is necessary for two reasons. It  is necessary to give statutory legal pro tection to the students, and it is neces sary because it is an issue of safety for  the students. The situation in China  makes the override necessary.  Mr. Speaker, first we saw the massa cre, and then we saw the masquerade.  Many of my colleagues alluded to the  events that have followed the massa cre  in Beijing:  the  repression,  the  denial, the continued repression,  the  increased  repression  following  the  pal,  death  of  Deng  Xiaoping's  Ceausescu, in Romania.  Now  the Government of China,  in  addition  to  suppressing  freedom  of  speech,  because  it became  clear  in  June that, if someone speaks up for  freedom in China, they can be killed,  and many people were; now the Gov ernment  in China,  in opposing  this  override of this legislation, is trying to  curb freedom of speech in the United  States.  Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt that  the President of the United States be lieves  in human rights and that he  does not want  to send  the students  back, but I  think the statutory legal  protection  is  necessary  because  it  guarantees the safety of the students.  Not only that they do not have to go  back, but that it guarantees that they  can speak freely in the United States  without any fear that their speaking  out will be punished in China.  I know of a case of someone in my  district who fled from China, from the  Tiananmen Square massacre, had an  interview with the press in the United  States and is now wanted for rumor  mongering  in China.  I  ask my col leagues, ""Can you imagine if everyone  who had an interview with the press  was wanted for rumor mongering?"" In  addition to that we know that the Chi nese Government continues  to  take  handwriting samples of students  in  universities in order to compare it to  posters during the demonstration  in  May and June.  Mr. Speaker, I believe that we dis agree with  the  President  on  the  method of reaching a bright future  with China, one based on economic,  cultural, and political ties because the  President had to do what he had to do.  He believed he had to veto the bill.  However, my  colleagues, Congress  must do what it must do. It must send  what we have all ref erred to today as a  very clear message to the butchers of  Beijing  that  their  behavior  places  them outside the circle of human be havior, and, if we are to continue this  relationship, and we certainly do not  want to isolate China, but to continue  the  relationship we must  insist on  their respect for human rights of the  people in their country.  What if we do not send that mes sage? What  is  the opposite message  that turning down the override, if we  sustain the President's veto, what is  the message that will go forth from  this body to the world?  Mr. Speaker, I believe that that mes sage is that we in the Congress of the  United  States  cheer  Lech Walesa  when he comes  in  for his  fight  in  Poland, take great pride in all of the  democratic sweeping of Europe that is  going on now, but it will say, ""The  people of the United States, we sup port lovers of freedom throughout the  world, and we support and encourage  ",1990

57,453,1,Mr. BUSTAMANTE.," Mr. Speaker,  yesterday  I  introduced  legislation  which directs the President's Science  Adviser to take the lead in coordinat ing Federal policy  to  improve math  and science education in this country.  The need for such legislation is ap parent given our Nation's projected  ""shortfall of 560,000 scientists and en gineers by the year 2010."" This short fall is aggravated by the underrepre sentation of minorities,  the  handi capped, and women in science, all of  whom will constitute, in the aggregate,  85 percent of the work force by the  year 2000.  [Washington Post, Jan. 9,  1990, p. Al 71  What we have, therefore, is a  two prong problem: On the one hand, we  currently don't have enough scientists  and engineers for research and devel opment purposes; and on  the other  hand, the future pool of working-age  Americans who could possibly fill that  gap have been traditionally underrep resented in those fields. To ensure our  Nation's economic competitiveness, it  is incumbent upon us as legislators to  find ways of increasing the representa tion of women and minorities in sci ence and engineering. This point  is  eloquently made by National Science  Director Erich Bloch who has stated  publicly that:  The  large  numbers of minorities  and  women in the country provide an opportuni ty-one we  cannot  afford  to miss. Our  motive should be pragmatism as much as al truism-the need to develop all our human  resources.  My own recognition of the relation  of minority education initiatives to our  Nation's economic  security  is what  prompted me to introduce, on March  22 of la.st year, H.R. 1561, The Hispan ic-Serving Institutions of Higher Edu cation Act of 1989. My distinguished  colleague  and  senior Senator  from  Texas, Finance Chairman LLOYD BENT SEN introduced the companion bill, S.  1669, on September 22 of  la.st year.  Senator BENTSEN and I introudced this  legislation because we believe that in  this age of constant technological ad vances and increasing global competi tion, our educational system is faced  with a tremendous challenge that the  Congress must help  that system  to  meet. That's one of the reasons why I  included  a  provision  in H.R.  1561  which would authorize postsecondary  institutions to increase the representa tion of Hispanic-Americans  in math,  science, and engineering, for although  ""Hispanics comprise 9 percent of the  population       only 2 percent of all  employed scientists and engineers"" are  Hispanic.  In fact, increasing representation of  Hispanic-Americans in these fields was  one of the specific strategies outlined  in a Federal report entitled-""Chang ing America: The New Face of Science  and Engineering.""  That was the title of the final report  of the task force on women, minori ties, and the handicapped in science  and technology, which was statutorily  established during the 99th Congress  for the purpose of issuing recommen dations on how to shore up our scarci ty of workers with scientific expertise.  The same task force  recommended  that the Federal Government take the  lead  in  launching programs  to help  the American education system to im prove math and science instruction:  The Federal Government  is  the  largest  single employer of scientists and engineers.  It finances one-half of all research and de velopment performed in the United States.  It has a special responsibility to be a pace setter.  By taking the lead in math and sci ence promotion, the Federal Govern ment would be indirectly encouraging  private  industry and State and local  government to do the same. Some of  ",1990

Mr. Parrell is retir ing after 16 years at  the Wilkes-Barre VA  Medical Center and has worked with the Vet erans' Administration, now Department of Vet erans Affairs, for the past 34 years.  Mr. Parrell began serving our area veterans  on March 31, 197 4. He has overseen the op erations of a 405-bed medical facility, two sat ellite outpatient clinics, and a 120-bed nursing  home. The Wilkes-Barre Veterans' Administra tion Medical Center provides care to veterans  living in 19 counties in Pennsylvania, 3 in New  York, and 2 in New Jersey. As director, Mr.  Parrell was responsible  for  the management  of all resources necessary to serve the veter an population serviced by these facilities.  A northeastern Pennsylvania native son, Mi chael Parrell was born  in Hazleton, PA and  graduated from Hazelton High School. He at tended  George Washington  University  in  Washington, DC, and served  in  the military  from December 1942 to December 1945 with  the Army Corps of Engineers.  From 1946 until 1951, Mr. Perrell worked in  the insurance division of the VA district office  in Philadelphia, PA. He began as an underwrit er training officer, became assistant chief of  the underwriting section and supervisor of the  underwriting unit, and finally held the position  of administrative assistant of the underwriting  section.  Mr. Perrell worked with the VA department  of  insurance  in  the Washington, DC central  office from 1951 until 1963. In this department  he served in a number of capacities including  methods  examiner,  management  analyst,  senior evaluation  survey officer, evaluation  staff chief, and executive assistant to depart ment head.  In July of 1963, he became the  executive assistant  to  the director of  insur ance service  in  the department of veterans  benefits.  In 1964, Mr. Perrell began working with the  department of data management  in  the VA  central office. He served as associate director  of systems operations service, executive as sistant to the department head, and as direc tor of planning and budget staff.  Prior to becoming director of the VA Medi cal Center in Wilkes-Barre, Mr. Parrell served  in a hospital administrative trainee position at  the VA Hospital in Washington, DC.  Mr. Michael Perrell has dedicated his  life  not only to the veterans of the 11th Congres sional District but  to  veterans across  the  country. I know my colleagues in the House of  Representatives will join me in congratulating  Mr. Parrell on his retirement and for a career  for which he can be proud.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  HAVEL'S NEW YEAR'S ADDRESS  TO THE NATION  HON. JOHN J. LaF ALCE  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 24, 1990  ",1990
78,479,1,Mr. LAFALCE.," Mr. Speaker, 2 months ago  Lech Walesa, in addressing a joint session of  Congress, began his remarks with the words,  ""We, the people."" Those words, lifted as they  were from our Constitution, dramatically char acterized Poland's triumph of democracy.  Just 6 weeks later, another Eastern Europe an leader in another Eastern European coun try,  echoed  similar  sentiments,  telling  his  people about his dreams from ""a republic of  the people,  [and] which serves the people.""  That man was Vaclav Havel, The country was  Czechoslovakia. The occasion was his New  Year's address.  Recently,  I led a congressional delegation  to central Europe, and had  the great honor  and  privilege  of meeting and  talking with  President Havel.  I would like to take this op portunity to share his New Year's message to  the  people of Czechoslovakia,  one which  could aptly serve as a timeless message for  the freedom-loving people of all nations.  HAVEL NEW YEAR'S ADDRESS TO NATION  Dear fellow citizens. For the past 40 years  on this day you have heard my predecessors  utter  different  variations  on  the  same  theme, about how our country is prospering,  how many more billion tonnes of steel we  have produced, how happy we all are, how  much we trust our government, and what  beautiful prospects lie ahead of us. I do not  think you appointed me to this office for  me, of all people, to lie to you.  Our country is not prospering. The great  creative  and  spiritual  potential  of  our  nation is not being used to its full potential.  Whole sectors of  industry are producing  things in which no one is interested, while  the things we need are in short supply.  The state, which calls itself a state of the  working people, is humiliating and exploit ing the workers. Our outdated economy is  squandering energy, of which we are  in  short supply. A country which could once be  proud of the standard of education of its  people spends so  little on education that  today it occupies 72d place in the world. We  have laid waste and soiled the rivers and the  forests that our forefathers bequethed to  us, and we have the worst environment in  the whole of Europe today. Adults in our  country die earlier than in most other Euro pean countries.  Allow me to tell you about a little person al experience of mine. Flying to Bratislava  recently, I found time during various meet ings to look out of the window. What I saw  was the Slovnaft Coil refinery] complex and  the Petrzalka suburb  immediately beyond  it. That view was enough for me to under stand  that our statesmen and politicians  had not even looked, or did not even want to  look out of the windows of their planes.  None of the statistics available to me would  have enabled me to understand more quick ly or more easily  the situation we have  gotten overselves into.  But not even all of that is the most impor tant thing. The worst thing is that we are  living in a decayed moral environment. We  have become morally  ill, because we have  become accustomed to saying one thing and  477  thinking another. We have learned not to  believe in anything, not to have consider ation for one another, and only to look after  ourselves. Notions such as love, friendship,  compassion, humility, and forgiveness have  lost  their depth and dimension, and  for  many of us they merely represent some kind  of psychological idiosyncrasy, or appear to  be some kind of stray relic from times past,  something rather comical in the era of com puters and space rockets. Few of us man aged to cry out that the powerful should  not be all-powerful, and that the special  farms which produce ecologically sound and  high-""quality  foodstuffs  for  them  should  send their produce to the schools, children's  hostels, and hospitals, since our agriculture  is not yet able to offer this to everyone.  The previous regime, armed with its arro gant and  intolerant  ideology,  denigrated  man into a production force and nature into  a production tool. In this way it attacked  their very essence and the relationship be tween them. It made talented people who  were capable of managing their own affairs  and making an enterprising living in their  own country into cogs in some kind of mon strous, ramshackle, smelly machine whose  purpose no one can understand. It can do  nothing more than slowly but surely wear  itself down, and all the cogs in it.  When I talk about a decayed moral envi ronment, I do not mean merely those gen tlemen who eat ecologically pure vegetables  and do not look out of their airplane win dows. I mean all of us, because all of us have  become  accustomed  to  the  totalitarian  system, accepted it as an unalterable fact,  and thereby kept it running. In other words,  all of us are responsible, each to a different  degree, for keeping the totalitarian machine  running. None of us is merely a victim of it,  because all of us helped to create it togeth er.  Why do I mention this? It would be very  unwise to see the sad legacy of the past 40  years as something alien to us, handed down  to us by some distant relatives. On the con trary, we must accept this legacy as some thing which we have brought upon our selves. If we can accept this, then we will  understand that it is up to all of us to do  something about it. We cannot lay all the  blame on those who ruled us before, not  only because this would not be true, but also  because it could detract from the responsi bility each of us now faces-the responsibil ity to act on our own initiative, freely, sensi bly and quickly.  Let us not delude ourselves: not even the  best government,  the best parliament, or  the best president can do much on their  own, and it would be profoundly unjust to  expect them alone to put everythillg right.  Freedom and democracy, after all, mean  that we all have a part to play and bear  joint responsibility. If we can realize this,  then all the horrors which the new Czecho slovak democracy has inherited will sudden ly cease to appear too terrible. If we can re alize this, hope will return to our hearts.  In putting right the general state of af fairs, we already have a sound footing on  which to build. The recent times, and espe cially the last 6 weeks of our peaceful revo lution, have shown what an enormous gen erally humane, moral, and spiritual charge  and what high standards of civic maturity  lay dormant in our society under the mask  of apathy that had been forced upon  it.  Whenever anyone talking to me began to  put  categorical  labels  on  our people,  I  always pointed out that society  is a very  mysterious creature, and that it  is never  ",1990
79,492,1,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, I offer my  best wishes  to Frances Hesselbein as she  leaves her post as the National Executive Di rector of Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. this month.  As a former Girl Scout myself, I have a deep  affection for the program.  Mrs. Hesselbein led the Girl Scouts for the  past  13  years,  and  saw  the  organization  through many changes. She has worked to in crease membership  throughout  the eighties,  including dramatic  increases  in  racial/ ethnic  minorities.  She  is  an  excellent manager,  leader and is unsurpassed in her dedication to  community service.  Mrs. Hesselbein has been an excellent role  model for the youth of America. She worked  to change their lives for the better, and to pro vide equal access for all to her dream. She fo cused on each individual to help them attain  their own potential and be the best they could  be.   Mrs. Hesselbein's contribution to the educa tion of our youth will always be remembered,  and although she will be missed, she will for ever be a part of the Girl Scouts, and I would  like to thank her for all the effort and good will  she has put into shaping the future of the Girl  Scouts, and the youth of America.

80,492,1,Mr. GREEN.," Mr. Speaker, as a Member of  Congress privileged to represent Chinatown in  New York City, I should like to announce that  Saturday, January 27, marks the beginning of  the Chinese New Year. The Chinese year  4688  is  the Year of the Horse, a totem of  stamina, speed, and reliability.  The Chinese New Year season is a time of  kindness and goodwill to all, and a time of for giveness and reconciliation. It is celebrated on  the first day of the first month of the lunar cal endar. The celebration lasts several days, be ginning with  family observances and ending  with gala festivities. For the Chinese,  it is a  time of closing the business of the old year,  clearing debts, and cleaning house.  The Chinese community is a source of im mense pride  to our city, and  their culture  brings enrichment  to  the  lives of all New  Yorkers. I am proud to celebrate with them at  this special time and wish them a very happy  new year.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  January 24, 1990  ""FIXING"" THE NOTCH  HON. CASS BALLENGER  OF NORTH CAROLINA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 24, 1990  ",1990
81,492,1,Mr. BALLENGER.," Mr. Speaker, the Social  Security ""notch"" continues to be an issue that  causes concern and misunderstanding among  senior citizens. The most misunderstood point  of all, however,  is  that  legislation  to  fix  the  notch will actually be given serious consider ation.  While many Members are eager to sponsor  proposed fixes, few are willing to actually put  this measure to an up-or-down vote. The lead ership of the House, by refusing to bring this  measure  before Congress,  protects  those  Members who seek to gain political mileage  from their sponsorship of legislation. In public,  sponsors can pretend  to support ""fixing  the  notch,"" while knowing full well the legislation  will never come to a vote in the House.  In the 1 OOth Congress, I signed a discharge  petition calling for a vote on notch legislation.  I have again signed a discharge petition this  Congress. It is time to take this matter off the  back burner and subject it to full and vigorous  debate,  resolving  the so-called notch  issue  once and  for all.  I urge  the cosponsors of  notch  legislation  to  join me and others  to  force a vote on this issue.  DORIS MORTON, A ""WE THE  PEOPLE ... "" LEADER  HON. WILLIAM H.

The events that have  occurred around  the world during  the past  several weeks makes  this more  important  than ever.  I am pleased to commend the efforts of one  of our educational leaders in my congression al district whose dedication  to  the  improve ment of the civic education of our students  has been exemplary. Through  the dedicated  and voluntary efforts of Doris Morton,  thou sands of our students have participated  in a  program designated as ""We the People . . .  Bicentennial Programs on the Constitution and  Bill of Rights."" This curriculum introduces stu dents to the philosophical ideas of our found ers, the historical background of the Philadel phia Convention, and the issues and debates  that shaped the writing of our Constitution. In  this program, students learn how our Govern ment  is organized and how  it protects  the  rights and liberties of all citizens. Finally, and  most important, students learn of the respon sibilities which accompany  the rights of citi zenship in a democracy.  It is a pleasure for me to express my admi ration and appreciation to Doris Morton for her  impressive contributions  to  the development  of competent and responsible citizenship.  INTRODUCTION  OF  A  JOINT  RESOLUTION  DESIGNATING  ""NATIONAL WATER  RECREA TION SAFETY WEEK""  HON. JOHN J. RHODES Ill  OF ARIZONA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 24, 1990  ",1990
83,492,1,Mr. RHODES.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing a  joint  resolution designating  the  week of May 20, 1990, through May 26, 1990,  as ""National Water Recreation Safety Week.""  This resolution is inspired by the drowning  death of one of my constituents, K.C. John son, of Mesa, AZ. He died in a boating acci dent on an Arizona  lake. This  senseless,  needless accident caused his family to estab lish the K.C. Johnson Memorial Foundation to  assist families whose loved ones have died in  drowning accidents. The foundation also pro vides public education regarding the dangers  of water-based recreation and safeguards that  should be taken in our recreational waters.  Drowning  is  the second  leading cause of  accidental deaths of persons 5  through 44  years of age  in America. Alcohol and drugs  are involved in 2 out of 3 of those accidents.  The highest drowning rates occur among chil dren under 5 years of age. On average, 1,200  deaths occur each year in the United States  as a result of boating accidents.  These are preventable accidents that need lessly claim  the  lives of our children and  young adults. This resolution will help increase  public attention  to  the dangers as we ap proach the peak water recreation season this  coming summer.  I invite all of you  to  join in  cosponsoring this legislation to help carry out  the education and public awareness work of  the K.C. Johnson Memorial Foundation,  the  National Water Safety Congress and similar  organizations across the country.  SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS  Title  IV of Senate Resolution 4,  agreed to by the Senate on February  4, 1977, calls for establishment of a  system for a computerized schedule of  all meetings and hearings of Senate  committees, subcommittees, joint com mittees, and committees of conference.  This title requires all such committees  to notify  the Office of  the Senate  Daily Digest-designated by the Rules  Committee-of  the  time, place, and  purpose of the meetings, when sched uled, and any cancellations or changes  in the meetings as they occur.  As  an additional procedure along  with the computerization of this inf or mation, the Office of the Senate Daily  Digest will prepare  this  information  for printing in the Extensions of Re marks section of the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD on Monday and Wednesday of  each week.  Any changes in committee schedul ing will be indicated by placement of  an asterisk to the left of the name of  the unit conducting such meetings.  ",1990
84,518,1,Mr. DIXON., I thank my friend from  Wyoming.  ,1990
85,518,1,Mr. SIMPSON.," Under the direction  of the President of the United States,  nothing is going to happen to the Chi nese students. So if we can start with  that basic premise maybe we can get  something resolved.  George Bush was our Nation's Am bassador to the People's Republic of  China for a year and a half. He knows  the players. He knows who is in favor.  Who is not in favor. He knows who the  hardliners are, the conservatives, the  imperialists. He knows the moderates.  He knows those who want change in  their country, and he knows them by  name. He knows more about China  than anyone in this body, bar none, on  either side of the aisle. Let us keep  that in context.  And you know  if we are going  to  come into this cooking on all boilers I  can do that, too. I did a little of that  yesterday. I was severely reprimanded.  However, it seemed appropriate at the  time because we were  talking about  partisanship. I said, you know, there is  a partisan tinge to this, and do not let  anybody miss it.  First, I do not think it comes from  the fine sponsor in the House, NANCY  PELOSI. I think she is very sincere and,  in essence, a progressive person trying  to do her very best for a remarkable  constituency. But, as we  say, when  they had their visit up in Harvard on  January 3 and 5, she fell in with evil  companions because up there at that  little session was John Sasso, who is  the  fellow  that personally cut  JoE  BrnEN's bicycle tire, and he is an indi vidual who is a raw partisan.  She was there in the best interests  of her constituency. Senator KENNE DY'S person was there. Also there were  Congressman GEPHARDT's person, Con gressman BARTON'S person, or maybe  the Congressman himself. It was a bi partisan group. Also  there was Rick  Schwartz, who is an advocate of any thing that has  to do with opposing  anything in our immigration or refu gee policies that are at least sensible.  It was called a group to plan strate gy  to override  the President's veto.  That is what it was and what they met  for. They did not meet  in a  social  event on  the banks of  the Charles  River at Cambridge. That is that. I be lieve Congresswoman PELOSI when she  tells me that she did not sense a severe  partisan tinge to this.  But after hearing Senator DIXON I  am reminded of that old story of the  woman of the WCTU,  the Women's  Christian Temperance Union gaining  force in the thirties promoting prohi bition. She was railing and exhorting,  bringing down the fire, the brimstone,  and the terror from the cliffs, heavy  stuff, on the evils of booze and the  degradation, depravation  and  ruina tion of the family with the grain and  the grape and how they had led to the  grave. She said ""Our Lord would never  have stood for it."" The guy in the back  loosely composing himself, his breath  familiar to all around him, said, ""How  about that time when He turned water  into wine down there at the wedding  in Cana?""  Well, she drew herself  to her full  proportion and she said, ""I'd thought  more of Him if He hadn't done it.""  I think I sense that here. ""I would  have  thought a whole  lot more of  George Bush if he had not done it.""  But he did do  it, because he knew  what he was doing.  And why did he do it? I hope we can  get away from hearing too much more  about champagne toasts. That seemed  to trigger a lot of glands in the United  States. Somebody ought  to  talk  to  Brent Scowcroft  and  get,  as Paul  Harvey said, ""the rest of the story.""  Why did Scowcroft go on a secret  mission  to  the People's Republic of  China? Because if he had gone public ly they would have repudiated him to tally.  I  thought George Bush, our  fine  President, expressed it beautifully yes terday when he said, ""What would you  think would have happened if I called  the fine majority leader,"" who accused  the President of kowtowing.  I  think  our fine majority leader has stepped  up his gunfire. If he wishes to do that  we have a lot of people to return the  f µsillade  over here. We have  some  skilled people  to do  that well.  I am  surprised at the renewed partisanship  and intensity of our majority leader.  He  threw another gratuitous shot  into  the game  this morning,  some thing about George Bush seeing the  light on the EPA Cabinet position. He  didn't know how he came about to re verse his position. He did that yester day.  If that is what we are in for we have  some remarkable cannoneers on this  side of the aisle. But he opened that  door and if that is what he wants to do  fine. He called it kowtowing.  What is the purpose of bringing this  up on the first and second day when  we come back if it is not partisanship?  Somebody please  tell me.  I want to  hear that, and I know I will hear it in  the debate. We can wait 2 months and  find out what happened,  and  in 2  months  if nothing happens then we  can do it to him in spades.  Let us review why Scowcroft went to  the People's Republic of China. He  went secretly. And what George Bush  said yesterday I think is so important.  He said, ""What if I had gathered the  majority leader, and the other Mem bers of their party together and said  weeks ago, what would you think if I  send somebody secretly to China, and  if I did that we might get them to lift  martial law? We might get them to re""It is  lease and give amnesty to 561 people.  We might be able  to get the Peace ~  Corps back underway in that country,  those remarkable carriers of democra cy? We also  then would reopen the  Fulbright  programs  and  other  ex change programs. What would you  think, should I do that?""  I bet you from my 10 years of know ing the majority leader and the assist ant majority leader and others in that  party  they would have  said,  worth the risk, Mr. President; try it.""  I think all of us in this Chamber will  admit that that is the way that would  have been handled. And I think any body would honestly  say  the same  thing.  So he did it and then this drumfire  of patter because it looks good, it looks  very good for a free swing at the Presi dent and his policy. This is a freebie;  you cannot lose a nickel on this one.  So Brent Scowcroft went, and he  went so he could give them the busi ness, and he went  to  tell  them the  President of  the Vnited States was  trying to be reasonable, diplomatic that being his nature as a diplomat and  that when  the Congress  came  back into session they were going to do  a number on the Chinese Government.  Brent Scowcroft told them, ""And the  Congress will do a tremendous number  on you, and if you do not believe it,  you are lost in the swamps.""  That is what he told them. He said,  ""We  are  repulsed  and  revulsed by  what you did in Tiananmen Square.""  That is what he told them.  And amidst all the clinking glasses  somebody  left out a very  important  part of the speech, where he said, and  you can get a copy of that if anyone  cares  to do  that, ""It would not be  honest of me to come here if I did not  tell you that we have profound areas  of  disagreement.  Your  complaints  against us in your official organs are  repugnant to us. And it is not what  the administration did to you that is  causing you pain. It is what the Con gress  is doing to you that is causing  you your pain and you are going to get  it in spades.""  That is what he told them.  So, we have the reason it is just a cu rious debate is that we have a mixture  here, and we do not seek purity over  here, but I can tell you this, we have  people who feel very strongly on our  side of the aisle that this is an oppor tunity  for  those who  still  believe  deeply  in  the  transgressions of Red  China, that is deep in their bosom, our  strategy with regard to Taiwan and its  recognition,  that  is  there  in  their  bosom, very real.  There are some who look upon this  as  the greatest opportunity of out reach into the Asian community and  the Asian fundraising community that  we would ever know, a new part of  Fort Knox. I understand that. There  ",1990

87,531,1,Mr. ARMSTRONG., I will be happy  to yield.  ,1990
88,531,1,Mr. KENNEDY.," The Senator has  brought up a very important point the actions that we take may very well  be questioned-and that is the power  of the President in the application of  the pocket veto. We have had the deci sions by the courts that the President  of  the United States cannot pocket  veto when the Senate is in brief recess.  The question was whether we were in  sufficient recess this time. That is a  question where there are very substan tial differences of legal opinion.  Many constitutional authorities be lieve that the pocket veto only applies  when the Congress actually adjourns.  So the point that is taken by the Sena tor  from Colorado  is whether  the  President  is  going  to  rely  on  the  pocket veto, which he has said he may  very well do this time. It is not clear  now whether he  is  relying on  the  pocket veto. And  in questioning  the  counsel for  the administration,  they  have some differences on that;  they  take issue about whether we are deal ing with a pocket veto or a real veto.  But if it should be a pocket veto, then  it would not have to be respected. You  would have a difference in the legal  situation as well.  I  thank  the Senator  for bringing  that up, because it is something that  should be considered.  ",1990
89,531,1,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President, I  appreciate the comments of the Sena tor from Massachusetts. I do not know  what a court would hold, and I do not  know that this is going to result in a  lawsuit, though it may, but I submit  that information for the RECORD  just  for the benefit of persons who are in terested.  I really do not want to bog down in  the  legal arguments.  I am perfectly  content to let the lawyers argue this  out among themselves after 5 o'clock  at a local pub or in court or wherever  else they want to take it up. I just do  not want to get in the middle of that.  I also want  to note, however, one  other legal issue which I think is sig nificant, and that is the theory of the  Attorney General that he may solve  this problem by regulations, assuming  that  the  statute  has  been  validly  vetoed and is not overridden. That is  open to dispute by some lawyers.  The Senator from Wyoming made  the point that the lawyers who argue  this are partisan opponents of  the  President. I do not know whether that  is true or not, but I would just like to  tell you who the legal authorities are  that have brought this to my atten tion. One is Robert Charles Hill. He  came to the private practice of the law  from the U.S. Department of Justice  where he served during the Reagan  administration as deputy director and  counsel in the Office of Asylum Policy  and Review, a highly specialized unit  which was created by  the Attorney  General in light of the now infamous  Medvid  incident, which may be  re called by some Members of the Senate.  So he is a person who has expertise in  this  field. He has  some  credibility  about it, and I have no reason to be lieve that he is a political opponent of  the President, although someone may  have information about that which I  do not have.  This  is  also  a  concern  raised by  senior members of the American Im migration Lawyers Association, specifi cally by Mr. Jimmy Wu, who  is  a  member of the board of governors of  the Immigration Lawyers Association,  and by Mr. Edwin Rubin, who is the  president-elect of the American Immi gration Association, a separate issue,  and I ask unanimous consent also, Mr.  President, to print their statement in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  JANUARY 23, 1990.  Hon. WILLIAM L. ARMSTRONG,  Hart Senate Office Building, Washington,  DC.  DEAR SENATOR ARMSTRONG: We have  re viewed the regulations promulgated today  by the Attorney General regarding applica tions for asylum from foreign nationals who  fear persecution because they have violated  their country's .coercive population control  policies.  While  the Administration believes  that  these regulations would afford greater pro tections than those contained in H.R. 2712,  we  remain concerned that  they may not  provide relief to some applicants. In particu lar, the regulations may not overturn earlier  rulings by the Board of Immigration Ap peals <BIA> which say resistance to forced  abortion and sterilization does not consti tute political dissent.  Neither China nor any other country is  specified in the regulations as having coer cive population control policies. Since the  burden of factual proof is on the asylum applicant, he or she would have to prove in  each case that China's policies were in fact  coercive. This is precisely what the BIA has  refused to find;  indeed, the BIA has gone  out of its way to find the Chinese program  to be a legitimate exercise of governmental  authority. As  in previous cases,  the BIA  could simply determine that any individual  horror story was a local enforcement prob lem, and that in any case the applicant was  not being singled out for persecution.  Nothing in the regulations defines resist ance to coercive population policies as meet ing  the  legal definition of refugee under  Section 10Ha><42><A>  of  the  Immigration  and Nationality Act. Thus, even if the appli cant proved that China's policies were coer cive and that he or she would likely be pun ished for violating them, the BIA still could  find that such applicant did not meet the  legal definition of a refugee.  It is our view that the regulations leave  doubt and ambiguity where H.R. 2712 is un ambiguous and clear. In light of the brutal  means which the Chinese government em ploys to enforce compliance with its popula tion control policies, ambiguity can have dis astrous consequences. Therefore, we believe  H.R. 2712 is by far the most certain method  to protect  these men and women  from  China's unconscionable practices.  Sincerely,  EDWIN RUBIN,  JIMMY WU,  ROBERT HILL,  Former Deputy Director, Asylum Policy  and Review Unit, Department of Jus tice.  ",1990
90,531,1,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President, I  do not want to go any further in the  legal issues because in the end this is  not going to be settled on some kind of  basis of disputing the fine points of  law, nor do I think it is going to be set tled on the basis of partisanship.  I appreciated that my friend from  Wyoming clarified his earlier observa tions and made it clear that he did not  accuse everyone of being partisan. I  still do not quite agree with him in his  interpretation of that meeting up at  Harvard. I do not know John Sasso. I  have heard a  lot about it. I was not  there. I do not know whether I was in vited or not. If I was, I did not go. I  have only been to Harvard once in my  life and enjoyed my experience, and if  invited by Mr. Sasso, the Chinese stu dents, or Harvard, I would probably go  back. But the implication is what hap pened is a bunch of Democrats went  up there and figured out some way to  embarrass the President and sharpen  the partisan nature of this issue.  The Senator  from Massachusetts  says  that is not so.  I guess  that is  right; he probably would know about  that. But suppose that is exactly what  happened. I do not think that is any thing to criticize.  Ladies and gentlemen, that is what  the Democrats are here for, in part, to  draw a partisan line with the Republi cans, and, by gosh, that is in part what  we Republicans are here for,  to tell  why we are different from the Demo crats. The  system  is  not breaking  ",1990

93,544,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Tennessee.  ,1990
94,544,1,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to urge my colleagues to join in  overriding the President's veto of H.R.  2712,  the  Chinese Adjustment  of  Status Facilitation Act.  Last  summer,  the world watched  with respect and admiration as Chi nese students staged a peaceful pro de mocracy rally in Tiananmen Square.  The world watched in awe as a  lone  student-armed only with moral cour age-stood in front a tank and brought  the military might of  a  repressive  regime to a halt.  Later, we watched with horror as  the tyrants who rule China ruthlessly  crushed the students' cry for freedom.  We now know that only weeks after  that night in Tiannanmen Square, our  National  Security  Adviser,  Brent  Scowcroft,  secretly met with  those  same  tyrannical  rulers. And only 2  months ago,  just as the walls of re pression were coming down in Eastern  Europe, we watched the National Se curity Advisor of  the United States  raise a glass to toast the Chinese lead ers whose own repressive tactics stand  in stark contrast to the wave of free dom  and  democracy  sweeping  the  world. Those visits-and  this veto send  the message  that  the United  States values friendship over freedom.  The President's inadvised veto puts  Chinese students here in the United  States  in grave danger and  it puts  their families  in China in danger as  well.  The President's proposal to handle  this  issue  through  administrative  means is simply insufficient. In fact, it  puts the students in more danger. The  students believe that to be the case.  First of all, it rests on shaky legal  ground. A recent Library of Congress  legal analysis concludes that-in the  absence  of  specific  legislation-the  President may not have the legal au thority  to  impose his administrative  remedy.  Second, it requires Chinese students  here in the United States to apply for  an extension of their visas. The Chi nese Government regards such an act  as a rejection of Chinese citizenship in fact as an act of treason. The Chi nese Government has already contact ed students warning them not to apply  for the President's program.  I believe we owe these brave young  students better than that.  The  legislation we are considering  today will off er  real protections  to  Chinese students. First, it waives the  2-year  home  country  residence  re quirement for nationals of  the Peo ple's Rebublic of China. Thus,  stu dents who have demonstrated for free dom can apply for  residency  in the  United States without  returning  to  China.  Second, it presumes continuous U.S.  residence for the purpose of status ad justment or changes of status for stu dents who were in lawful nonimmigra tion status as of June 5, 1989.  Third,  it allows Chinese  students  lawfully in the United States on stu dent and exchange visas to work, to  make a living.  Mr. President, this is real protection  for the students. This is real security  for them. And by giving them auto matic coverage they will not have to  take any individual actions which will  endanger their families in China.  Mr. President,  the model  the stu dents chose for their rally was one of  the most inspiring symbols of Ameri can freedom-the Statue of Liberty.  The President's veto of H.R. 2712 flies  in the very face of everything that  statue stands for.  At the foot of the Statue of Liberty  lies a broken chain which represents  tyranny. What lies at the foot of the  President's veto is the broken hopes of  these Chinese students in the United  States who so bravely demonstrated  for an end to tyranny in their home land.  Mr. President, we  should override  this veto. Not to do so is to send a mes sage to the Chinese Government that  repression  is acceptable. That is  the  message President Bush wants to send.  It is the wrong message.  ",1990

97,544,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Texas.  ,1990
98,544,1,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, what is  at issue is not whether these students  are going to be sent back into an op pressive country to face punishment  from a totalitarian government. Both  our actions and the President's actions  have guaranteed that the students are  not going to be sent back against their  will.  Quite frankly, Mr. President, I am  delighted the students are here. I want  to see more come. If things should  turn out so they should decide not to  go back, we are  talking about over  40,000 people, the smartest people in  China. And if that intelligence is com bined with the ingredient that Amer ica provides best-freedom-I have no  doubt that there are Noble Prize win ners in this group of students, I have  no doubt  that  they can contribute  greatly to America and to the world. I  look forward to that contribution.  What is at issue here is not are the  students going to be sent back. Wheth er we override the veto or whether we  do not, they will not be sent back and  we all know that. What is at issue here  is whether we are going to make the  decision or whether we are going to  allow the President to make it.  I  think it is  interesting, Mr. Presi dent,  that 30 years ago  this debate  probably would never have occurred.  If President Eisenhower had picked up  the  telephone and called Sam Ray burn and Lyndon Johnson and said, ""I  know there is concern about the stu dents; I want to assure you they are  not going to be sent back; I am going  to issue an Executive order; I believe,  based on my experience with dealing  with the Chinese, that that is the best  way to do it,"" my belief is-and I think  history, if we  look back at it, would  probably indicate that I am correct that Speaker Rayburn and Majority  Leader  Johnson would  have  said,  ""That is fine with us, Mr. President, if  that is what you think is best.""  What we have seen, as we all know,  is  that partisanship has not died at  the Nation's shores, and we have a  continuing attempt  in Congress  for  each of us to play as if we are Presi dent. I am swayed by the President's  opinion. I personally do not agree. My  guess is,  if I were President, I would  sign this bill. If I were President, I  ",1990
99,557,1,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, I am  voting to override the President's veto  of H.R. 2712, a bill to allow Chinese  students  to  remain  in  the United  States rather  than be sent back  to  China to suffer intimidation and per secution by a repressive regime.  For me, this is not simply a vote on  the Pelosi bill. This  is a vote on a  policy that is ineffective, and against  the broader  interests of  the United  States.  The President has based his China  policy on the mistaken and dangerous  assumption  that the present  leader ship, President Yang Shangkun and  Premier Li Peng, are proreform. They  are not. They are antiref orm. And  they are weak and unstable to boot. It  is not in our interest to legitimize this  regime any more than it is in the in terests of the long-suffering Chinese  people. The President apparently does  not understand this. Instead, he sends  virtually the highest ranking officials  in the Government on a secret mission  to Beijing. He vetoes the Pelosi bill.  He creates an atmosphere where those  with real claim to asylum are shunned.  Where NED money for some modest,  legitimate prodemocracy activities  is  blocked. And he signals to our allies  that a resumption of military sales or  ""business as usual"" is fine.  What has he received in return? A  so-called lifting of martial law in Tian anmen. A visa for a new VOA corre spondent. A promise to begin discus sions on the resumption of the Ful bright Program. And, most recently,  the announced release of 573 people  who  had  been  arrested  since  the  events in June-of more than 10,000  thrown in jail. That is an average of 80  released each month-at which rate it  would take more than 10 years to re lease all those now held. This, it seems  to me, is a meager return for the blow  the President has dealt to the legiti mate  aspirations  of  the  Chinese  people.  The President is backing the Beijing  government, not the Chinese people.  In doing so, he is backing the wrong  horse. The demonstrations in Beijing  last spring showed the regime's lack of  legitimacy. And the unforgiveable use  of force against those peaceful demon strators showed that the regime knows  this. When events in Eastern Europe  resonate among the Chinese people,  the Chinese Government cracks down  harder,  vowing  that  the  fate  of  Ceausescu will not be  the  fate of  China's military dictator and so-called  president, Yang Shangkun. Party or ganizations have been revived in facto ries. Surveillance of students has intensified. Political indoctrination, for gotten for years, is back. The discon tent of the people is palpable.  This ferment has affected even the  leadership, which was never united  about the proper response to the dem onstrations, and which remains divid ed now.  But the internal instability and do mestic woes of the Beijing government  do not necessarily mean that its dicta torial rule will evaporate  in days or  months or years.  This awareness seem to be what mo tivates  the President  to  ignore  the  events of the last year. ""After all, the  present leader may be in power for a  long time. They are strategically im portant. We cannot afford to upset or  isolate them.""  This calculation is shortsighted. No  government can  last forever against  the will of its people. Neither Noriega,  nor Marcos,  nor  the Shah  could  remain in power, no matter how much  money they poured into their security  apparatus. And if, in the short term,  we won friends  in our fight against  communism, we did so at a far deeper  cost  to  our  good will  among  the  people-who always eventually got the  reins of government back. The fall of  Ceausescu should send a strong mes sage to the White House; it surely did  to the forbidden city.  For  some-including  perhaps  the  President, his National Security Advis er  and  the Deputy  Secretary  of  State-this  eventuality  presents  a  problem. They do not know how to re solve  the  long-term  issue, but know  they need  the short-term gain. So,  they  embrace  the Marcoses,  the  Shahs,  the Li Pengs, and  the Den  Xiaopings. And they scorn the naivete  of the congressional leaders who ques tion their realistic approach.  But, as  the Chinese sage Lao Tse  said, we need not leave our home to  see the world. Our foreign policy can  and should be guided by the principles  we believe in most deeply-that a gov ernment should represent, not repress,  its people. And our policy  toward a  country must reflect what is best for  its people: representative political in stitutions, an environment  that can  nourish individual economic artist and  basic social justice.  The repression of the prodemocracy  demonstrators  in Tiananmen Square  was brutal and unforgiveable. If the  President is right in saying that China  is too important to isolate, he is wrong  to legitimize the government by trying  to  please  it. On  the  contrary,  he  should recognize that the present Chi nese Government  is  acting out of  weakness, not strength. That under standing should guide our response.  Clearly, our first and most appropri ate  response has been  to freeze all  military sales and cooperation, to sus pend significant export licenses, and  ",1990

101,583,1,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President, for a  number of years many of us have  worked tirelessly to bring clean air and  acid rain legislation to the floor of the  Senate. And, for years our efforts were  foiled for many different reasons, not  the least of which being the opposi tion of strong utility and industry in terests and competing regional inter ests. But now, after a 12-year hiatus,  we begin deliberations on one of the  most important environmental issues  facing our Nation: Chronic air pollu tion.  Mr. President, I rise today to speak  in support of S. 1630, the Clean Air  Act Amendments of 1989, which  is  now pending before the Senate. I want  to take this opportunity to praise the  members of the Senate Environment  Committee for drafting and reporting  out legislation that I am hopeful will  bring about an end  to  the 12-year  stalemate on this issue. I also want to  commend President Bush, whose lead ership on this issue has broken the po litical logjam.  There are a number of areas that  will be addressed during Senate debate  on S. 1630, including ozone nonattain ment, air toxics, ozone depletion and  the greenhouse effect. However, one  issue that I and many of my constitu ents have taken a particular interest  in is the problem of acid rain.  As my colleagues know, acid rain is a  major problem in many areas of the  country, but especially in the North east. This problem has led to the deg radation of our forests, lakes, and his torical buildings as well as the deterio ration of visibility  in  such natural  areas as the White Mountain National  Forest  in my home State of New  Hampshire.  More  importantly,  a  number of studies point to the precur sors of acid rain as causing adverse  health effects. The population most at  risk are infants and children, the el derly, pregnant women and those with  heart diseases,  asthma, emphysema,  and  bronchitis.  Clearly,  immediate  action to curb this problem is needed.  I  strongly  support  the  aggressive  provisions contained in title IV of S.  1630 which are designed to drastically  reduce sulphur dioxide and nitrogen  oxide  emissions  from  utility power  plants and other sources. Under the  bill annual emissions of sulphur diox ide <S02) and nitrogen oxide <NO,)  would be reduced by 10 million and 2. 7  million  tons  respectively. A  cap  is  placed on utility emissions after the  2000,  assuring Northeastern States  like New Hampshire that utility emis sions will not grow beyond the levels  prescribed in this bill.  Finally, the measure ini.tiates a new  program  of marketable  allowances.  Under this program, utilities are as signed annual allowances equal to the  amount of S02 and NOx  they may  emit. These allowances may be traded  with other utilities so that a national  emissions standard can be met while  giving utilities the greatest amount of  flexibility at the lowest cost.  Mr. President, I support the sense of  the Congress resolution contained in  S. 1630 which labels cost sharing as  undesirable. I firmly believe that the  polluter should pay in this case. Under  S. 1630, utilities in nine States, which  are responsible for more than 50 per cent of all U.S. emissions of acid rain  precursors, would bear about 50 per cent of the costs to the comply with  the acid rain provisions. Moreover, in  many  instances  the electric rates  in  these States are below the national av erage, partly because of the unwilling ness of utilities in these States to con trol their emissions. For these reasons,  I believe the utilities should bear the  full cost of compliance with this meas ure. Frankly, it is unconscionable  to  think  that  ratepayers  in my State,  who have been the recipients of acid  rain pollution, would have to pay an  electricity or other  fee  in order  to  assist utilities in these nine States to  pay  to clean up  their plants.  I am  hopeful  that  the Senate will  not  amend title IV of this bill to include a  cost sharing provision.  Once again, let me praise the work  of the Environment Committee as well  as President Bush.  I  am heartened  that the Senate will debate a.nd take  action on this very important piece of  legislation and I  look forward to the  debate on this and other issues during  floor consideration of S. 1630.

102,583,1,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, yes terday, we began consideration of leg islation to reauthorize the Clean Air  Act. There are few issues Congress has  considered this decade more important  to all Americans  than legislation  to  improve our air quality.  Today, we are more aware and better  informed of  the  important environ mental  challenges  that  face  our  Nation and planet. We are more famil iar with terms such as global warming,  ozone depletion, acid rain, and carbon  monoxide. With this familiarity comes  responsibility. Responsibility  to  take  the necessary action to reduce threats  to our air resources and to begin to  clean up  the mess we  have made.  Today, we take that action.  I congratulate the majority leader,  the chairman of the Environment and  Public Works Committee and the floor  managers of this bill for their efforts  to bring clean air  legislation  to  the  Senate's attention. This action is long  overdue.  NEW MEXICO  Clean air is a particularly important  issue to the citizens of New Mexico. I  am proud of the efforts we have made  in my State. We are blessed with clear  skies and scenic vistas. We hope  to  keep  it  that way. Our utilities and  copper smelters have made the expen sive capital improvements necessary to  reduce harmful S02  emissions. Our  largest city has embarked on a.n ambi tious course of action to attack both  the CO  and  ozone  problems. New  Mexicans are willing to make the sac rifice necessary to preserve air quality.  IMPROVING THE BILL  Mr. President,  I  support clean air  legislation. S. 1630 gives us a compre hensive approach to address clean air  issues. However,  there are provisions  of this bill that must be improved. Let  me review a few of these areas.  ACID DEPOSITION  I strongly support the provision in  title IV of the bill which requires 107  utility plants to reduce their S02 emis sions by January 1, 1995.  In earlier  versions of S. 1630, only 20 plants-in volving 70 boilers-were covered. If the  20-plant option had been adopted, the  resulting  emissions  requirements .  would have meant that the 20 plants  could only use  scrubbers. No other  technology would have been able  to  meet the emissions targets. With 107  plants and a more equitable emissions  ",1990
103,596,1,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President,  con stituents are writing us in anger that  their Social Security taxes are being  used for other purposes than for sav ings  toward  their  own  retirement.  They don't really mind pay as we go fi nancing for Social Security, because  all of us agree we want to take care of  promises made to current beneficiaries  and those soon to retire.  But it makes people mad that Social  Security taxes are used to conceal the  true size of the deficit in other Federal  funds accounts. They want real sav ings.  President Roosevelt and  the 74th  Congress established Social Security  with  the ""public  relations promise""  that every American would be paying  taxes to save for his or her retirement,  and that is what every American today  wants: Save the money, don't spend it.  I am introducing legislation today to  fulfill  the promise of the 74th Con gress. The Social Security Benefits En hancement Act would create a new  family savings plan benefit as part of  the Social Security system.  The Social Security Benefits En hancement Act is a marriage of the  best  ideas  from  those who  say we  should cut the Social Security tax and  restore  payas-we-go  financing wedded to the proposal by President  Bush to increase our national private  savings rate and create family savings  plan accounts for every American.  I support both of these great, cre ative ideas. Let's have honest account ing  in Government by cutting  the  Social Security tax and let's increase  the national private savings rate,  to  enhance retirement benefits.  The Social Security Benefits En hancement Act would repeal the un necessary 1988 and 1990 tax increases.  Revenues  from  those  tax hikes are  only serving to conceal the deficit in  the Federal funds accounts by collect ing too much currently in the Social  Security trust funds.  The Social Security Benefits En hancement Act would use those sur plus funds to increase the private sav ings rate of every American family,  rather than spending it for other Gov ernment programs. This is what our  constituents want.  Social Security current and future  benefits would not be affected-the fi nancing problem facing Social Securi ty 25 years from now will still confront  a future Congress, as it does today.  Even  today we know some  future  Congress will have to find a way to  redeem the Treasury securities in the  OASDI  trust  funds. Even now, we  know that future retirement benefits  depend on taxes collected in the very  same year benefits are paid out. There  is no saving in the public sector; it's a  contradiction in terms.  Under the Social Security Benefits  Enhancement Act,  there will be real  savings. The future financing problem  for  common  benefits will  be  un changed-but every American family  will also have a Social Security family  savings plan in addition to currently  authorized Social Security benefits.  These SSFSP accounts will make  every American family better prepared  for retirement, for home ownership,  and for financing higher education for  their children. Overall benefits are en hanced.  The Social Security Benefits En hancement Act provides for every em ployer to establish, as part of his pen sion plan, a special account to collect  the surplus that is today going to the  Government for general spending.  Self-employed individuals would be  authorized to set up their own savings  plan, under proper supervision, and  workers whose employers do not par ticipate would have special accounts in  the U.S. Treasury.  Every  year,  the  Social  Security  trustees would calculate how much of  the Social Security tax is needed to  pay  the coming year's benefits, and  the surplus-if any-would be author ized to be paid by the employer,  in stead of  to  the Treasury,  into  the  Social Security family savings plan ac counts that every private pension fund  in America would have, and which this  proposal would establish.  Federal Government employees al ready enjoy a thrift savings plan with  most of the features I would put in  the Social Security Benefits Enhance ment Act. I think the average Ameri can worker  should have  the  same  family savings opportunities as part of  his or her retirement pension system  as the Federal Government employees  enjoy.  I ask unanimous consent for the text  of my bill to be printed in the RECORD  following my remarks.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 2026  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION  1.

104,609,1,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President,  today I rise along with Senator BIDEN  to introduce the Civil Justice Reform  Act of 1990. This  legislation  is de signed to reduce litigation costs and to  increase the administrative efficiency  of the civil  litigation process  in the  Federal courts.  Over recent years, the workload of  the Federal  court  system  has  in creased  dramatically. At  the  same  time, we must assure that the man power  and  equipment necessary  to  meet this increased workload is provid ed. Unless we do so, the result will be a  feeling among members of the bench  and bar that civil litigation in the Fed eral court system is much too costly  39-059 0-91-20 (Pt. 1)  and takes far too much time to resolve  disputes.  Based  upon  these  concerns,  the  Brookings Institute organized a  task  force which produced the ""Justice For  All Report,"" which makes several rec ommendations to reform the civil jus tice process. The task force was com posed of a vast array of  individuals  that  represent  competing  interests  within our civil  judicial system. The  legislation we are  introducing  today  embodies their recommendations and  should provide a  necessary  starting  point for consideration and discussion.  Among other things, the bill directs  each of the Federal district courts to  develop and  implement civil  justice  delay  and  expense  reduction plans  within guidelines set forth by Con gress. The district courts have been  given flexibility to create procedures  and policies commensurate with  the  characteristics of their own particular  dockets.  Specifically, the bill creates a case  management and  tracking system in  which  cases  are  assigned  to varied  processing paths, each of which have  separate time frames for the comple tion of discovery and for trial. A pre mium is placed on setting early and  firm trial dates. Time guidelines are  set for completion of discovery and  necessary motions. An  emphasis  is  placed on early, active, and continuous  docket control by the court. Addition ally, this bill creates a voluntary alter native dispute resolution program. Fi nally, this legislation provides for im proved and expanded case manage ment training for district court judges.  Mr. President, it  is appropriate to  consider  procedural  changes which  would reduce the costs and delays con fronted by those who seek to resolve  their disputes through the civil litiga tion system.  We must ensure that the public has  confidence in our Federal court system  to  resolve  their  legal disputes. For  these reasons, I am pleased to intro duce the Civil Justice Reform Act of  1990.  By Mr. SYMMS (for himself, Mr.  BINGAMAN, Mr. JOHNSTON, Mr.  McCLURE, Mr. BUMPERS, Mr.  WALLOP,  Mr.  BAUCUS,  Mr.  BURNS, Mr. DIXON, Mr. DOMEN ICI, Mr. GARN, Mr. GORTON, Mr.  GRASSLEY,  Mr.  HATCH,  Mr.  HELMS, Mr. KASTEN, Mr. LoTT,  Mr. LUGAR, Mr. STEVENS, Mr.  WILSON, Mr. SIMON,  and Mr.  HATFIELD):  S.J.

MULTIPLE-USE SUSTAINED-YIELD WEEK  ",1990
105,609,1,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, today I  take pride  in  joining with my col league from New Mexico, and 18 of  our fell ow Senators, in introducing a  joint  resolution commemorating  the  beginning of the fourth decade of the  Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of  1960.  That act, signed by the President on  June 12, 1960,  embodies  the  funda mental concepts that govern the Fed eral Government's vast landholdings both Forest Service and Bureau of  Land Management-comprising  over  720 million acres of land and covering  almost one-third-31 percent-of the  surface area of the United States.  In that light, one could call the Mul tiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act the cor porate policy statement for the world's  third largest real estate holding com pany-with  only  the U .S.S.R.  and  China controlling more land.  The  legislative history behind  the  Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act is an  important one. The bill signed by the  President, H.R. 10572, was an original  bill reported by Congressmen Cooley  and Poage,  then chairman and vice  chairman of  the House Agriculture  Committee. I think it is significant to  note that it was one of approximately  50 similar bills introduced that year to  legislate  a  multiple-use/sustained yield policy for management of Gov ernment lands.  In the debate just prior to passage of  the bill by the House, Representative  George M. Grant of Alabama,  ex plained the intent of the Multiple-Use  Sustained-Yield Act as follows:  This bill will direct the Secretary of Agri culture to administer the national forests  for all of  their renewable  resources, and  none of these resources is given a st~tutory  priority over the others. All of  these re sources provide great benefits to the Nation,  and all of these resources in general should  be given equal consideration  in managing  the national forests under the principle of  multiple use.  In Senate debate on the Multiple Use  Sustained-Yield  Act,  Senator  Humphrey of Minnesota rose  to say  that  the  bill,  ""represents  a  sound  public policy and constitutes 'good leg islation.' "" He was particularly pleased  that ""no weakening amendments were  adopted in the Senate,"" and he con cluded his remarks inserting the fol lowing letter:  Hon. HUBERT H. HUMPHREY,  Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.  The  undersigned  national membership  conservation organizations endorse and re affirm their full support of the objectives of  national forest multiple-use bills H.R. 10572  and S. 3044. We believe H.R.  10572,  as  passed by the House, protects total public  interest in the natural resources values of  national forests and urge its adoption with out amendment.  The letter was signed by: The Ameri can Forestry Association, the Citizens  Committee on Natural Resources, the  National Audubon Society, the North  American Wildlife  Foundation,  the  Wilderness  Society,  and  the  Izaak  Walton League of America.

106,648,1,Mr. MACHTLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  yesterday,  we voted on  the question of overriding  the  President's veto of H.R. 2712,  legislation  to  provide statutory authority to protect Chinese  nationals studying here in  the United States.  There are many reasons I felt it was important  to support the override.  Some will argue that the President's direc tive offers equally as much protection as that  offered under H.R. 2712, legislation Congress woman PELOSI has sponsored-and of which  I am a cosponsor. This may be true from the  administration's mine, or my neighbor's point  of view. But,  then again, we are  not  the  people who would be most affected by  this  decision.  I am not threatened with return to a country  whose leadership conducted a bloody massa cre against my  friends and countrymen; nor  am I troubled with the threat of an unfair trial,  and the potential of my summary execution at  the hands of the government; nor am I threat ened with  reprisals against  family members  abroad who have been forced to write letters  condemning me as an incendiary or a revolu tionary.  The answer to the question of who is most  affected by a decision on whether or not to  override the President's veto is obvious-it is  the Chinese students  themselves. And  it  is  them who  I  think we  should most closely  listen  to as we make decisions  for  their  fu tures, and formulate policy responses to their  concerns.  That message made clear,  I ask you  to  listen  to  the  following excerpt  from a  letter  drafted by a group of Chinese nationals study ing in the United States. They write:  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  We are extremely afraid of our security if  we were forced to return to China. Because  most of us have either participated or been  actively involved in a wide range of peaceful  activities  to  support  the  pro-democracy  movement  in China. The Chinese  fascist  regime has vowed  to persecute those who  dare  to call  for democracy,  freedom and  human rights. We have certainly met the  standard of ""well  founded  fear of perse cution"" if we were forced to return to China  Therefore, we beg you to pass legislation  to eliminate our fears ... We believe that if  the visa status of the 40,000 well-educated  Chinese students and scholars can not be re solved  legislatively,  then  the majority of  them will either apply for political asylum  with  the  INS whose administrative  func tions will be heavily burdened by the  in creased case load, or others who fear for re prisals against their families in China due to  their filing of asylum applications  in  the  U.S. will simply stay here and become ""ille gals"" who cannot perform  their qualified  functions and would be a waste to society as  a whole.  And  I am pleased that the vast majority of  the House of Representatives  joined me  in  making this message heard by voting to over ride the veto of H.R. 2712, and to provide the  Chinese students with  the  legislative remedy  they have called for.  NEWSLETTER AND SURVEY ON  THE FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICIT  HON. ANTHONY C. BEILENSON  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 25, 1990  ",1990
107,648,1,Mr. BEILENSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to share with our colleagues a newsletter on  the Federal budget deficit that I wrote for my  constituents  last  fall, and  the  results of  the  questionnaire I sent to them as a followup.  I was personally encouraged  by  the  re sponse to both the newsletter and the ques tionnaire. After  the newsletter was sent, we  received a great many  letters, phone calls,  and comments at community meetings  from  constituents expressing  their grave concerns  about the deficit as well as their willingness to  accept unpopular spending cuts and  tax  in creases to bring this problem under control.  The response to the questionnaire, sent to  over 200,000 households of voters, was even  more gratifying. We  received over 8,000  re sponses-most of which were filled out by two  persons-to  this  rather  time-consuming  survey.  In both part I, ""General Spending Pri orities,"" and part II, ""Specific Choices for Re ducing  the Deficit,""  the respondents showed  strong support  for cutting defense spending  and  raising  taxes-the  two principal ways  available to reduce the deficit.  Seventy-seven percent of  the respondents  believe  that the Federal Government should  spend less on defense, and a majority believe  we should spend more on assistance to  the  poor, on public investment and infrastructure,  and on environmental protection. Near majori ties also want more spending on benefits for  the elderly and on  law enforcement. But,  im portantly, by nearly 2 to 1,  these voters are  January 25, 1990  willing to pay more taxes to fund increases in  these programs.  Asked to choose among specific options for  reducing  the deficit over the next 5 years, a  majority of the respondents selected enough  program cuts-mostly  from defense-to cut  the 1994 deficit by $52 billion, and enough tax  increases to cut that year's deficit by another  $47 billion, assuming  those measures were  enacted now. This response demonstrates the  willingness of the voters of the 23d Congres sional District of California  to accept much  greater spending cuts and tax increases than  President Bush or Congress have  thus  far  been willing to support.  The newsletter and questionnaire follow:  SPECIAL REPORT: THE FEDERAL BUDGET  DEFICIT-SEPTEMBER 1989  (BY CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY C. BEILENSON)  OUR NATION'S MASSIVE BORROWING  IS DRAIN ING OUR RESOURCES AND MORTGAGING OUR  CHILDREN'S FUTURE  The federal government's rapidly growing  mountain of debt, caused by our enormous  annual budget deficits, continues to be the  most  serious  and  threatening  problem  facing our nation.  This report is the first of two newsletters  I am devoting entirely to the subject of the  budget. It discusses why the U.S. govern ment's debt grew so dramatically, how our  annual deficits are hurting the U.S. econo my and our international position, and what  the obstacles are to dealing seriously and re alistically with our budget problem. My  next newsletter will  be  a  questionnaire  giving you the opportunity to choose what  steps  you  personally would  support  to  reduce to deficit.  Why so much attention to this one issue?  Because the threat that these deficits pose  to our nation's economic health profoundly  influences every decision the President and  Congress make  about  every other  issue.  Until we bring these deficits under control,  our options for dealing with every other na tional  problem  are  severely  limited-we  can't even begin to adequately address the  drug crisis, homelessness, gaps in our health  care system or any of the other major social  problems that virtually everyone agrees we  should be confronting. Defense policies, too,  will continue to be shaped more by budget  pressures than by an objective evaluation of  our national security needs.  PILING UP THE NATIONAL DEBT  Budget deficits are not something new;  the  federal  government has  spent more  money than it has taken in almost every  year since World War II. But the deficits  after 1981  have  averaged $180  billion  a  year-nearly  three  times  the size of  the  largest single deficit prior  to 1981. And,  these deficits have occurred at a time when  the  government  has  had  no  legitimate  reason to borrow so heavily: our nation has  been at peace and, for the last seven years,  enjoying what has become the longest eco nomic expansion of the post-World War II  period.  As a result of these huge recent deficits,  our national debt has soared from $930 bil lion in 1981  to $2.8  trillion today. In the  eight years of Ronald Reagan's presidency,  we  tripled the total amount of debt that  had been accumulated during the previous  two hundred years of U.S. history, from the  beginning of George Washington's presiden cy to the end of Jimmy Carter's.

109,713,1,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker, yes terday President Bush wrote that his  budget's chief emphasis was on  the  future.  In  the  last century Charles  Dickens also wrote about the future.  In the Christmas Carol, Scrooge asked  if Tiny Tim would live. He was told if  the shadows of the future remained  unaltered, Tiny Tim would die.  In the Bush future, budget author ity for housing the elderly and handi capped children like Tiny Tim would  decline by $201 million from the fiscal  year 1991 baseline, but there is more  relative growth in the defense spend ing than in fiscal year 1986.  In the Bush future, budget author ity for child nutrition programs for  children like Tiny Tim would decline  by $460 million from the fiscal year  1991 baseline, but there is more rela tive growth in defense spending than  in fiscal year 1987.  In the Bush future, budget author ity for Medicaid for children like Tiny  Tim would decline by $88 million for  fiscal year 1991 baseline, but there is  more relative growth iri defense spend ing than in fiscal year 1990.

All of  us look forward to working with him  as he leads his subcommittee and we  deliberate on the 1990 farm bill.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield to  the  distinguished  gentleman  from  Kansas [Mr. GLICKMAN], the chairman  of the Subcommittee on Wheat, Soy beans, and Feed Grains.  ",1990
111,739,1,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  I  thank  the chairman of  the whole  Committee on Agriculture for calling  this special order. I want to pay him  special tribute for his advocacy of agri culture and rural issues in this coun try. No Member of Congress has done  more  to alert  the American people,  both  urban  and  rural Americans,  about the needs and hopes and aspira tions of folks  in rural America than  the gentleman from Texas CMr. DE LA  GARZA].  His  charts  showing  the  amount of money spent on agriculture  as compared with the entire budget, in  showing what a small percentage of  our dollars are actually spent on agri cultural programs, are renowned in a  variety of circles in this country as he  has shown how little we invest in agri culture compared with the dividend we  receive from the producers of food and  fiber.  The  items  that my  subcommittee  has jurisdiction on, wheat, corn, other  feed grains, and soybeans, are among  the biggest crops  in this country in  terms of value.  When we entered the beginning of  this 5-year farm bill we had tremen dous problems in agriculture. Some of  those still exist, particularly  in  the  high plains in western Kansas, Okla homa, and Texas. Problems in agricul ture, of course, remain in many parts  of this country.  We lost tens of thousands of farmers  to low prices. There was an epidemic  of low prices, agricultural foreclosures  and farm dislocations during the first  4 or 5 years of this decade.  The 1985 farm bill was not perfect  and some of us had problems with it.  In fact, I even voted against the bill  because I was worried what it might  do to the budgetary problems of this  country.  Still that 1985 farm bill did provide a  safety net for wheat farmers and for  corn farmers. Had it not been for that  bill, lots of additional folks would have  gone under. The purpose of the bill  was a safety net. It provided that func tion.  It is my hope that if we go forward  into the 1990 farm bill, we will recog nize  that we need  to continue that  safety net. We need to resist efforts to  dramatically reduce the impact of that  safety net, so that farmers, particular ly younger farmers getting into agri culture for the first time, can stay in  business and can be productive con tributors  to  this nation's economic  strength.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  think  that will  happen because I sense that there is a  bipartisan  feeling, Republicans  and  Democrats in this body, who want to  see American agriculture sustain itself,  who are not willing  to unilaterally  disarm  to our competitors overseas  until such time as we see that they in  fact want to lay down some of their  more difficult positions in trade.  So it is my hope that we will produce  a 1985 farm bill that does not reduce  target prices and that in fact contin ues this safety net that we have pro duced for so long.  In addition it is my hope that we will  continue the export enhancement pro gram which has done  so much  to  enable our producers to be competitive  in the world, particularly in the areas  of the grains and soybeans.  This export enhancement program  has allowed us  to compete with the  Europeans in providing sales of these  products to the Soviet Union, to third  world nations, and in fact to countries  all over the world. Without that pro gram there is no doubt that we would  have not made a lot of sales that we in  fact did make.  I would point out, however, that we  have found that there have been some  problems in the administration of that  program, particularly during the last  couple years of the previous adminis tration. It is my hope that Secretary  Yeutter and those other folks who are  running the department now have rec onciled  themselves  to some changes  which are necessary to restore confi dence that that program is working,  that there are no preferential deals to  perhaps some of the large internation al grain companies, and that honesty  prevails in the operation of the export  enhancement program.  I  think that is happening.

128,765,1,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, we are  now back on S. 1630, amendments to  the  Clean Air Act.  The  pending  amendment is the amendment offered  by  the Senator from Rhode  Island,  Senator CHAFEE, an amendment to add  methyl chloroform to the list of ozone  depleting substances to be phased out  along with specifically named chloro fluorocarbons.  Mr.  President,  the Senator  from  Rhode Island offered the amendment  because, as he stated in his presenta tion before the Senate, methyl chloro form is a substance which depletes the  stratospheric ozone layer. We have all  read and know about the ozone hole  that has developed over Antarctica. It  has spread not only over Antarctica,  but there is very sound scientific evi dence  that  the  stratospheric ozone  layer  is  also being diminished over  North America as well.  Why  is  it  important  that  this  amendment be before us  today, an  amendment which I have cosponsored,  an amendment which the majority  leader, Senator MITCHELL, has also co sponsored? It is important because the  scientific evidence  is clear that with  depletion of the stratospheric ozone  layer surrounding the Earth, a  layer  that  is about 70,000  feet above us,  there  is more ultraviolet  light  that  comes down from the Sun and strikes  the Earth.  Now, why is that significant? That is  significant because with increased ul traviolet light bombarding the Earth,  there is increased incidence of various  forms of skin cancer, many of which  are melanomic,  that is,  the kind of  cancer  that can  lead  to death, and  there is an equal incidence of nonmel anoma cancer, the kind of skin cancer  that does not lead to death but the  form of cancer that requires medical  attention.

129,804,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from New York.  ,1990
130,804,1,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Madam President,  the majority leader is on the floor.  I rise for two purposes. The first is a  celebratory one. I note that today, 38  years after the fact,  the Senate has  unanimously sustained the veto mes sage of Harry S. Truman on the inf a mous McCarran-Walter  Immigration  and Naturalization Act of 1952. During  the last 38 years,  in virtually every  country on the globe some person, re spectable or otherwise, but legitimate  in any event, was  told he could not  come to this country for fear that he  might say something that would infect  the minds of Americans who are pre sumably  incapable  of  thinking  for  themselves  in matters of foreign af fairs and public policy.  The Committee on Foreign Rela tions has been pressing this matter for  3 years. We have suspended the act,  but with a sunset provision. Today the  McCarran-Walter measure  is perma nently repealed.  A colloquy entered in the RECORD be tween myself  and  the very  distin guished chairman of the Committee  on Foreign Relations notes that this  matter  is now done with,  and  the  ""lookout lists"" and the endless forms  and affidavits which the Immigration  and Naturalization Service has devel oped over 38 years are to come to an  end here and now as well, assuming  that the President will sign the bill,  which I am sure he will do.  On a second issue, Madam President,  may I note that this measure comes  before us this evening in altered form.  The bill as  it originally passed  the  Senate, then the House of Representa tives, and after a conference commit tee  of  both  bodies,  contained  an  amendment which  I offered, section  109, having to do with actions by mem bers of the executive branch which in volved the soliciting of funds from for eign governments and institutions and  persons in order to avoid prohibitions  on the use of public moneys for such  purposes.  The President vetoed that bill which  had been very carefully debated here  in  the Senate. Out of concern  for  other provisions, not  the  least  the  McCarran-Walter  provisions,  the  House of Representatives dropped sec tion 109, sent the bill otherwise intact  to us and, out of concern  for  the  McCarran-Walter provisions and other  matters,  I  chose not  to off er  the  amendment once again at this time.  But I do rise, Madam President, to  say that this is not an end of the issue.  We are involved here with a grave con stitutional  question which,  as was  noted on the floor yesterday, recently  and conspicuously arose in the Iran Contra episode. But the matter goes to  the very basis of the relationship between the Presidency and the legisla tive branch in foreign policy. It goes to  the fundamental question of whether  ours is to be a nation and a govern ment of laws.  Madam President,  the President's  veto message stated that this section  would result in: ""A dangerous timidity  and disarray in the conduct of U.S.  foreign policy.""  That, Madam President, was not the  view of the Senate and not the view of  the House. We were not seeking  to  bring about timidity, much less disar ray. If there was ever an example of  disarray, we saw it in those years when  the executive branch sought to avoid  the prohibitions of the Boland amend ment with respect to aid to insurgen cies  in Central America and shipped  arms to Iran unbeknownst to the Con gress much  less  to  the American  people. That strikes me as disarray.  What we. were seeking was to restore  to government the processes of lawful ness. I will take a moment of the Sen ate's time, if I may, simply to read the  prohibition. It says:  Whenever any provision of United States  law expressly refers to this section and ex pressly prohibits all United States assist ance,  or  all  assistance under  a  specific  United  States  assistance  account,  from  being  provided  to  any  specified  foreign  region, country, government, group or indi vidual, for all or specified activities, then no  officer or employee of the executive branch  may <A> receive, accept, hold, control, use,  spend, disburse, distribute, or transfer any  funds or property from any foreign govern ment  (including  any  instrumentality  or  agency thereof), foreign person or United  States person, <B> use any United States  funds or facilities to assist any transaction  whereby a  foreign government <including  any instrumentality, or agency thereof), for eign person or United States person, pro vides any funds or property to any third  party, or (C) provide any United States as sistance to any third party, if the purpose of  any such act is furthering or carrying out  the same activities with  respect  to  that  region, country, government, group or indi vidual for which United States assistance is  expressly prohibited.  Madam President, an effort has been  made to say that this was somehow an  ex post facto act with respect to the  Iran-Contra affair.  It was not. We  made clear that this ref erred to future  acts. We made clear that it only ap plied  to prohibitions  in which  this  statute was  specifically  cited. The  greatest care was taken that we should  do no more but also no less than see to  the obedience to law.  The distinguished majority  leader  on July 18 of  last year, when  this  amendment was being debated said:  ""Mr. President,  this amendment can  be summed up in three words: Obey  the law."" In fact, that is what it says.  It states  that neither the President  nor the Secretary of State nor any  member of the U.S. Government has  the right to break the law.  Yet  this  simple prov1s1on,  in  the  aftermath of that wrenching experience  still unresolved-Admiral Poin dexter's case is even now in the head lines-was  vetoed.  It was  vetoed,  Madam President, in full conformity  with earlier positions  the executive  branch has taken that encouraged the  original events of Iran-Contra or were  used to justify it.  Theodore  Draper,  in  an  article  which will appear in the March 1 issue  of the New York Review of Books enti tled ""The Constitution  in Danger,""  has this to say about the persons re cently or even now on trial here in  Washington. He said:  Yet  to  justify  their actions  they held  forth on just this constitutional issueThe issue of the preeminence of the  President, his prerogatives as against  his powersA highly dubious theory of a Presidential  monopoly of  foreign  policy had  filtered  down  to  them. Their reasons reflected a  school of thought that calls into question  the constitutional foundation of this coun try.  Theodore Draper  does not make  such statements lightly and I would  not repeat them on the Senate floor  lightly.  We  approached  a  constitutional  crisis of  the utmost gravity. It was  only the chance, or perhaps it was not  a chance, revelation in a Beirut jour nal that the arms sales to Iran were  going on that alerted the country and  Congress. Had  that not  happened,  where might we have ended?  Where we were heading is no place  this Senate would wish to see us go.  And we did not legislate in the imme diate aftermath. We did not legislate  hurriedly. We waited until last year.  Senator RUDMAN of New Hampshire  could not have been more cooperative  and helpful in seeing to it that this  language was  carefully  crafted,  be cause  it was a criminal statute and  vagueness is fatal to any such statute.  But this was a bipartisan effort. We  engaged  in  good-faith  negotiations  with the White House attorneys. They  never seemed to reciprocate the spirit  in which we were trying to negotiate.  And  the bill was vetoed. Very well.  The issue then remains.  I stand here, Madam President, to  say that I will return to this matter. I  am authorized to speak for the distin guished majority leader that he wishes  to do the same. We do not have this  matter behind us and we owe it to this  generation and above all we owe it to  generations  to come  to  see  that a  severe challenge to the constitutional  balance in the United States does not  go unregarded and unrestituted.  The simple  fact of  the matter  is  that, with  respect  to foreign policy,  the Constitution provides for shared  powers,  shared  responsibilities. And  the growing doctrine of Presidential  prerogative, by denying those constitu",1990
131,830,1,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President  as  we begin to face a new decade and to  tackle the problems that so urgently  need to be addressed, we are facing the  birth of a new world. It is a very dif ferent world from the one that con fronted us in 1950, far different even,  from that which existed in 1989. It is a  more hopeful world. The toppling of  Communist dictatorships  throughout  Eastern Europe holds the prospect of  a safer, more prosperous future.  The United States has an urgent  need-a compelling national interest to promote  the process of peaceful  change underway  today  in Eastern  Europe.  U.S. spending priorities must reflect  this need. I am disappointed that the  President's budget message and his  State of the Union Address, fail to re flect this urgency.  For decades now we have poured lit erally  trillions of dollars  into stem ming  the  tide of  communism with  tanks and bombs and fighter planes.  While we must maintain a stable con ventional ~nd nuclear deterrent, new  global reallties oblige us to shift our  priorities. We need, too, to use our dol lars to nurture the seeds of democra cy, help to provide the support that it  so desperately needs  to survive. For  just a fraction of the cost of confront ing communism militarily, we could  complement our military efforts with  other more productive initiatives.  We need a comprehensive plan  to  promote  and  secure  democracy  in  Eastern Europe. I believe the timidity  of the Bush administration's approach  is unacceptable.  I am therefore today calling for new  initiatives patterned after  the Mar shall plan  to  aid Eastern Europe.  These countries were originally includ ed in that 1947 plan that fueled the re covery of Western Europe, making the  Common Market nations a bastion of  democracy and economic success. Because of the intervention of the Soviet  Union, Eastern European  countries  were excluded from the Marshall plan  at that time. It is now long past time  for them to join their Western neighbors in a comprehensive effort to build  a more peaceful, more democratic, less  confrontational Europe.  Congress has already taken a solid  first step in setting forth the blueprint  for such a program. Last November,  1~ we passed the landmark Support for  Eastern European Democracy Act of  1989 CSEEDl. This legislation provided  some  assistance-currency  stabilization, food aid,  investment funds-for  Poland  and Hungary  as  they  em barked on the initial stages of reform.  Now we need to look beyond. We must  prepare  ourselves  for  changes  throughout Eastern Europe, and  in  other areas of the world, as communist regimes continue to fail.  8  30  55  40  ~~  50  p~litical  _I am therefore pleased to join today  with Senator PELL  to  introduce  a  SEED II bill designed to expand last  year's measure to cover all of Eastern  Europe.  I would propose  to  finance  this  increased  foreign  aid  through  commensurate reductions in function  050-Def ense in the budget resolution.  When Senator SIMON, Senator PELL,  and I worked together in drafting the  SEED legislation last fall, only Poland  and Hungary had yet thrown off the  yoke of communism. Now, Rumania,  Czechoslavakia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia,  and East Germany have all made sig nificant strides in ending Communist  domination and in taking steps toward  greater democracy in their countries.  We must have the foresight and deter mination to match the people of East ern Europe and  join with  them  in  turning a hopeful vision into a pros perous, democratic reality.  The  pace  of  reform  in Eastern  Europe over the past few months has  been overwhelming. While these coun tries struggle to reshape their econom ic  and  institutions,  their  Western neighbors struggle with them  to formulate a vision of the future and  to  determine what  their own  role  should be. One thing is clear: Commu nism is a bankrupt philosophy. There  can be no turning back to the repres sive policies of  totalitarian commu nism  in Eastern Europe. Yet  there  remain a host of questions to be an swered,  difficulties  to be overcome  and decisions to be made.  '  The  issues  facing Eastern Europe  are extraordinarily divisive. The ques tion is no longer how to reform, it is  how much  to  reform, how  soon  to  reform, and in what manner and order  to proceed. These questions will not be  answ~red quickly or painlessly, for re shapmg a  society and an economic  system requires consensus as well as  determination and skills-and consen sus is still extremely elusive.  The erosion of Communist control  has revealed another set of unresolved  conflicts. Ethnic tensions in Bulgaria,  Hungary,  and  Romania-indeed  throughout the Eastern bloc-threat en to weaken the nascent democracy  movements.  Nationalist  sentiments  revive old territorial claims and fears  of renewed militarism. The change in  governments  is  necessarily  accom plished by the uncertainties surround ing the fate of the Warsaw Pact and  the  security  of  the Soviet Union.  These  issues not only make change  more difficult, but they can potential ly destabilize all of Europe.  Such  questions  obviously  concern  NATO and the West as much as they  concern Moscow and the Eastern bloc.  What role should the Western coun tries be playing-both vis-a-vis Eastern  Europe and the Soviet Union? At what  point  should  our  support  extend  beyond warm  rhetoric? Should our  ",1990
132,843,1,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President,  in all  the tributes to Martin Luther King,  Jr., there is one unusual one written  by Larry A.  Still  for  the Chicago  Metro News,  talking  about Martin  Luther King, Jr., as a college student.  I had the privilege of working a little  with Dr. King. As a young State legis lator, Dr. King asked me to come and  speak at the second anniversary of the  bus boycott in Montgomery, AL, at the  Bodextra Avenue Baptist Church.  I  had  the opportunity of spending 2  days with him at that point, and to  join in the early efforts for civil rights  in this Nation.  But, too often, perhaps, we focus on  Martin Luther King, Jr., as an already  emerged national leader. He did not  emerge overnight, and the column by  Larry Still should be encouragement  to students around the Nation.  I ask to insert this article into the  RECORD at this point.  The material is as follows:  [From the Chicago Metro News, Jan. 20,  1990]  MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., THE COLLEGE  STUDENT  <By Larry A. Still)  1989-90 could possibly be the second gene sis of when the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr. connects with college students.  For me however,  the greatness of Dr.  King grows stronger each year. Maybe this  is because I have continued to be drawn to  his life as doer, as well as dreamer.  Some veteran civil  rights activists have  said that King was not a saint, but a human  being. Yes, he was human, but what a  human being he was for all times.  Not every student will receive a Ph.D. in  Systematic Theology from Boston Universi ty as he did. Or graduate from Morehouse  College at  the age of 19. But  there are  enough parallels in Dr. King's collegiate ex perience and that of many college students  today.  In an earlier column, I spoke of the impor tance of new student orientations.  I mention this for two reasons; 1) at his  orientation/convocation, Martin King met  Dr. Benjamin Mays, one of  this nation's  greatest educators and 2>  like most fresh men, young Martin wasn't sure what he  would do career wise.  He participated in extracurricular activi ties; the glee club, the Young Men's Chris tian Association, the NAACP, the student faculty discipline committee.  Today, many multi-cultural students like  Martin, do become  standouts with  their  schools' newspapers, radio stations, student  governments and other social and academic  organizations.  Martin was a commuter student. He lived  at home. Today, the number of commuter  students, part time students and other non traditional  students  in higher  education  have completely changed the face of Ameri can colleges and universities.  After Morehouse, he won a scholarship to  Crozer Theological Seminary  in Chester,  Pennsylvania. While there, he enjoyed the  social life in nearby Philadelphia, attending  parties  and making  friends. Always  the  scholar he read Henry David Thoreau, Karl  Marx, Mahatma Gandhi, to name a few.  He next attended Boston University. Like  many students, he met a special friend, a  talented  and  pretty  young woman  in  Boston, who later became his wife and con fidant.  On August 28, 1955, Emmett Till, a 14  year old Chicago boy visiting relatives  in  Mississippi, was  kidnapped  and  lynched.  Two months earlier, Martin Luther King,  Jr. was awarded his Ph.D. from Boston Uni versity.  Today, racism continues to impact on col lege students. It is partly up to students and  officials to turn these negatives into motiva tors and positive reinforcers.  The  bonding  between Dr. King  and  today's students is coming about via the de mystification of this great world  teacher preacher <cut in the mold of Dr. Mays>.  Dr. King, the dreamer, may be a pretty  tough act for young people to follow, but  Dr. King,  the college student doer, may  touch more student scholars during  this  crucial developmental stage.e  INDEPENDENCE  ANNIVERSARY  OF THE FREE UKRAINIAN RE PUBLIC   ",1990
133,843,1,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, on Jan uary 22 we celebrated the 72d anniver sary of the proclamation of independ ence of the free Ukrainian Republic.  As I have done in the past, I would  like to pay tribute to the short-lived  Ukrainian state, and  to  those brave  Ukrainians who  still  struggle  every  day against Soviet occupation of their  homeland.  That first attempt at freedom lasted  just 3 years before Red army troops  snuffed out independent Ukraine. The  ideals of  social  justice and human  rights were set forth during those 3  years. Freedom of speech, movement,  religion, and press were guaranteed.  But Ukraine was quickly incorporated  into the Soviet Union, and political in dependence and basic human rights  were denied.  Today we are encouraged by the dra matic changes in the Soviet Union and  by the policies of glasnost and peres troika. But there  is a  troubling dis crepancy between the rhetoric and re ality of Mr. Gorbachev's policies  re garding Ukraine. As  nationalism  in  Ukraine has grown, Soviet authorities  have continued  to harass Ukrainian  activists who nonviolently campaign  for human, religious, cultural, and na tional rights.  Equally difficult  to bear has been  the  continued  oppression  of  the  Ukrainian Catholic Church. This kind  of intolerance and hostility is terribly  painful for the deeply religious people  of Ukraine. Yet despite being forcibly  incorporated into the Russian Ortho dox Church  in 1946,  the Ukrainian  Catholics  have  not  forgotten  their  spiritual ties. They have recently been  able  to meet more freely  than ever  before, and their representatives have  even met with members of the Council  of Religious Affairs. Mr. Gorbachev's  historic 1989 meeting with the Pope  represented the kind of openness that  must spread  throughout  the Soviet  Union  so  that  religious  tolerance  might flourish.  I commend Mr. Gorbachev for his  . efforts and for the reforms that he  has already implemented. But I hope  that he will demonstrate his respect  for human, religious, cultural, and na tional rights by legalizing the Ukraini an Catholic Church, ending human  rights abuses, and fully extending the  fruits of democracy to the Ukraine.e  THE NATIONAL STUDENT/  PARENT MOCK ELECTION  ",1990
134,843,1,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, as 1990  began, oppressed peoples all over the  world were  exulting  in  their new found opportunity to establish democ racy. But here  in America,  in  the  world's longest lasting democracy, one  of every  two eligible voters did not  bother to go  to the polls in the last  election. One of every two 17-year-olds  does not know there are two Senators  from every State. One of every two be lieves the President can appoint Mem bers of Congress. In the last congres sional elections 4 out of 5  eligible  voters under 30 did not bother to vote.  Our American democracy cannot long  survive if those to whom we must pass  the torch carry it in careless hands.  I ask my colleagues to actively sup port what  is perhaps  the Nation's  most successful voter education effort.  Over 3 % million students and par ents in all 50 States and around the  world participated in the national stu dent/parent mock election on Novem ber 3, 1988. They met all across the  country and, through the Department  of Defense dependents' schools, from  Okinawa to Iceland, to cast their votes  on who would win the national elec tions and vote their recommendations  on key national issues. Mary Alice Wil liams, now with NBC, hosted a  90minute National Election Headquar ters Program on C-SPAN with satel lite pickups from Florida to Alaska as  the votes came in.  Time magazine's publisher's letter  called it, ""the largest voter education  project ever.""  The project won for Time, its princi pal  1988  sponsor,  the Silver Anvil  Award of the Public Relations Society  of America for the ""Best Program by a  Business  in Public Service"" nation wide, and the Big Apple Award of the  Public Relations Society of New York  for  the best community relations  in  the New York area. It has also won  awards  for COMSAT  and CONUS  Communications.  In 1989 the Time/National Associa tion of State Boards of Education  CNASBEJ and the Time/American As",1990
135,856,1,Mr. DENNY SMITH.," Mr. Speaker,  today  am pleased  to  introduce  the  ""Violent Crime  Control and Criminal Procedures Reform Act""  which  establishes  a  constitutionally  sound  death penalty and strengthens and  improves  Federal criminal penalties and procedures.  Title I of this legislation establishes a consti tutional  framework  for the  implementation of  the Federal death penalty.  It authorizes  the  death penalty for, among other things, murder,  espionage, treason, murder for hire, and cer tain attempts to assassinate the President.  It  is a balanced approach that provides constitu tional, streamlined procedures  for  imposition  of the death penalty.  Included as title 2 is language to reform cur rent habeas corpus procedures which will min imize Federal  judicial  interference with State  criminal convictions. Finality of litigation, and  the elimination of  the habeas abuse, which  currently surrounds State death penalty con victions is critical.  This package also  includes as  title 3, a  codification of the good faith exception to the  exclusionary rule that has been recognized by  the Supreme Court. In violent crime and drug  cases, vital evidence is often excluded at trial  simply because  the  law enforcement officer  unknowingly violated search and seizure rules.  However, the Supreme Court has recognized  that the exclusionary rule should not be used  when  the police officer has acted  in good  faith. This provision addresses a  legal  loop hole which has allowed drug off enders and  violent criminals  to go  free. This proposed  reform furthers the truth-seeking goals of our  criminal justice system.  Title 4 addresses the need to punish those  who commit drug-related and other violent  crimes with firearms. Title 4 permits consider ation of pretrial detention for certain firearms  and explosive offenses,  requires mandatory  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  revocation of supervised release  for posses sion of a firearm, and increases penalties for  giving false information in connection with the  acquisition of a firearm. Enhanced and man datory penalties  for  those who commit and  provide the means for others to commit vio lent crime must be key components of any  anti-crime legislation.  Title 5 provides for mandatory drug testing  of drug-related and  firearms-related defend ants on post-conviction release. This includes  probation, parole, and post-imprisonment su pervised release.  Title 6  restores Federal  jurisdiction over  public corruption cases and extends Federal  jurisdiction over all  drug-related  bribery of  public officials.

CONGRATULATIONS ARMY PVT.  ABEL VELASCO  HON. DUNCAN HUNTER  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 30, 1990  ",1990
136,856,1,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  take this time to congratulate a constituent of  mine, Army Pvt. Abel Velasco. Private Ve lasco participated  in  the successful  ""Oper ation Just Cause"" in Panama.  Abel, stationed at Fort Ord, had planned to  spend Christmas with his  family  in Brawley.  On  December  20  he  was  deployed  to  Panama. Private Velasco's mission while  in  Panama was to confiscate weapons and cap ture anyone linked to General Noriega.  For his service in Panama, Abel was award ed the Army Commendation Medal, which rec ognizes ""superior judgment and tactical exper tise far superior to his contemporaries.""  I am  including  for  the RECORD an article  that appeared in the Imperial Valley Press re garding Private Abel's experience.  I know my  colleagues join me in saying ""Thank you for a  job well done.""  [From the Imperial Valley Press, Jan. 24,  1990]  LATE CHRISTMAS FOR VELASCO  (By Lori Johnson>  Christmas came a month late but with  extra joy when Army Private Abel Velasco  came home to Brawley Saturday after par ticipating in the United States invasion of  Panama.  On Dec. 20 the Velasco family's tradition al Christmas plans were dashed when 19year-old Abel Velasco was shipped out as  part of the force sent to Panama to capture  Manuel Noriega and  free Panama of his  control.  He was deployed the day before he was to  come home  for Christmas on such short  notice he did not have  time  to  tell his  family.  ""I had no warning at all,"" said Velasco. ""It  was like 'pack your bags and go.' ""  ""It was  scary.  I  didn't know what  expect,"" he said.  Instead of tamales and a joyous family re union, Velasco found himself on Christmas  day in the midst of combat in Panama City,  working as an Army translator.  to  January 30, 1990  Velasco said there were so few bilingual  soldiers that he was taken from his platoon  to work directly with his captain.  ""My job was to find out information on  key personnel in the Noriega forces,"" said  Velasco.  Armed with a M16 rifle, Velasco said he  accompanied officers as they stormed build ings and homes of apparent Noriega associ ates. He said their mission was to confiscate  weapons and,  if possible, capture anyone  linked to Noriega.  He said he also helped to restore order in  the streets that was plagued with looting.  ""It's hard to explain,"" said Velasco. ""You  have to be there to know what happen. Pic ture L.A. with no law and  throw a  little  jungle in there. Everyone was doing what  they wanted to do.''  But Velasco was  reminded often of the  danger. ""There was sniper fire,"" he recalled.  When asked if anyone close to him was  wounded or killed in combat he declined to  comment. He said he was told by his superi ors not to talk about it.  Of  the  experience, Velasco  said,  ""You  don't really appreciate what life  is about  until you are put into this type of situation.  You learn to value life. You learn to appre ciate everything; a shower, a bed.""  Velasco had also been sent to Panama last  spring to restore order after riots started  when Noriega overturned the elections.  Valasco was awarded ""The Army Com mendation Medal"" for his participation in  ""Operation Just Cause."" He was chosen  from his company of 125  to  receive  the  medal. The certificate accompanying  the  medal stated, ""During this combat action,  <Velasco)  demonstrated  super  judgement,  initiative and tactical expertise far superior  to his contemporaries.""  Velasco, a native of Brawley, entered the  Army after he graduated  from Brawley  Union High School in 1988. He now is sta tioned in Fort Ord in Monterey.  The mission in Panama wasn't easy for his  mother and father Richard and Rachel Ve lasco of Brawley.  His mother recalled what she told her son  on the phone, ""As long as I hear your voice,  everything is OK.'  Although his mother spoke to him about  four times when he was in Panama, she still  worried.  ""Sometimes I would look at the news and  start crying,"" she said.  She said Christmas was especially hard.  ""We always make  a wish on Christmas  night,"" said Mrs. Velasco. ""We always have  a toast. But someone was missing.''  Mrs. Velasco recalled a telephone conver sation with her son. He asked her if they  were going to have a Christmas dinner when  he returned. She answered, ""Yes mijo. We  are.""  RAOUL W ALLENBERG: 45 YEARS  SINCE HIS TRAGIC ABDUCTION  HON. TOM LANTOS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 30, 1990  ",1990
137,856,1,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, January 17 of  this year marks  the 45th anniversary of the  abduction  of Raoul Wallenberg  by Soviet  troops  in Hungary  in  1945. The  dramatic  changes  that have  taken place  in Eastern  Europe  in  the  last few months underline the  ",1990
138,869,1,Mr. ROE.," Mr. Speaker, today the Committee  on  Science,  Space,  and  Technology  is  pleased to hear testimony from several distin guished representatives of America's partner  nations  in  the  international Space Station  Freedom Program. The committee's objective  in this hearing is to review the impact of the  National Aeronautics and Space Administra tion's proposal to rephase the Space Station  Freedom on  the  international partners' politi cal support, programs, and  funding commit ments. The Committee on Science, Space,  and Technology fully understands the import  of  the  international space agreement which  sets the precedents and foundation for negoti ating and implementing other international co operative agreements on future important sci ence issues such as the Moon-Mars explora tion  initiative and the superconducting super collider.  The Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology has held numerous hearings on  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the Space Station Freedom Program over the  past 5 years. Today's hearing, however, is the  first time in which we have invited our interna tional partners to express their views on this  most  important  international  collaborative  space mission. We look forward to gaining the  benefits of  their  insight on  this  important  issue.  After 3 years of vigorous international nego tiations, 18 months ago, the United States and  the  international  partners-Canada,  Japan,  and  the European Space Agency, comprised  of the following: the Federal Republic of Ger many,  France,  Italy, United Kingdom,  the  Netherlands,  Belgium,  Denmark,  Norway,  Spain,  Ireland-reached  an  unprecedented  international agreement to pursue a joint ven ture  in science and exploration aboard  the  Space Station Freedom. The final agreement  is a most complex network of commitments  and understandings in which each nation relin quished a portion of its autonomy and control  in exchange for reaching a mutually desirable  goal. The accord  represents a delicate bal ance of provisions and powers which we hope  can serve as a model for future  international  cooperative undertakings in science and tech nology.  Article 23 of the international agreement, in  title  ""Consultation"" under sections 1 and 2  states the following:  1. The partners, acting through their co operating agencies, may consult with each  other on any matter arising out of space sta tion cooperation. The partners shall exert  their best efforts  to settle such matters  through consultation between or  among  their cooperating  agencies  in accordance  with procedures provided in the MOU.  2. Any partner may request that govern ment-level consultations be held with an other partner on any matter arising out of  space station cooperation. The  requested  partner  shall  accede  to  such  request  promptly. If the requesting partner notifies  the United States that the subject of such  consultations  is appropriate  for consider ation by all the partners, the United States  shall convene multilateral consultations at  the earliest practicable  time,  to which  it  shall invite all the partners.  In a previous hearing of the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology, NASA  re ported that a prospect of uncertain funding led  NASA to rephase the space station  last fall.  The process began in what is now known as  the Langley Exercise, an internal NASA study.  Regrettably, this committee learned of this ex ercise from media reports and was not directly  consulted. The Committee on Science, Space,  and Technology has already stated  its deep  concern and strong views  regarding  the ap proach  that has been  taken  toward  this  re phasing exercise.  Many capabilities and features of the station  which we  regard as essential  to  the  future  U.S. space program have been placed in jeop ardy.  In addition, the rephasing  imposes sev eral significant changes on our partners. First,  the launches of both the Japanese experiment  module and the European Space Agency's at tached pressurized module have been de layed as much as a year. Second,  important  capabilities such as satellite servicing, and ad vanced space suits have been either deferred  or eliminated.  867  The Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology has made it perfectly clear time  and  time again that the success of this pro gram  is contingent on  funding stability. The  Committee on Science, Space, and Technolo gy took an important first step toward provid ing  this stability when  it authorized multiyear  funding  for Space Station Freedom. What  is  also needed, however, is a clear unambiguous  long-term financial commitment by the admin istration and by Congress. Otherwise, we will  be subject to continual rephasing,  rebaselin ing, and finally, a loss of future opportunities  to cooperate with other nations on other sci ence and technology projects.  U.N. CONVENTION ON  CHILDREN'S RIGHTS  HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 30, 1990  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker,  I  am honored to join my colleagues, Congress men Gus YATRON and DOUG BEREUTER, as  an original sponsor of a resolution calling for  the timely consideration of the Convention on  the Rights of the Child. The convention was  adopted by the 44th General Assembly of the  United Nations on November 20, 1989, and  must now be ratified by the Member States at least 20  in order to make  it binding. The  U.S. Government  is currently  involved  in an  interagency review of the convention.  The  convention,  hammered  out  after a  decade of debate by the international commu nity, enumerates many of the legal and moral  protections which should be guaranteed by  the State. A number of the protections do not  go far enough and the document certainly is  not absolutely perfect but,  for  the first time,  nations would commit themselves to protect ing a broad range of rights for children.  As Congressional Representative  of  the  United States Delegation  to  the United Na tions, Mr. Speaker,  I had  the opportunity to  present the U.S. statement on adoption of the  convention on November 10, 1989,  in New  York.  For consideration by my colleagues,  I  in clude my speech at this point in the RECORD.  DEFINING THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN  After 10 years of constructive dialogue,  seemingly endless consultations, and finally  an agreement, the Commission on Human  Rights has presented the Convention on the  Rights of the Child to the UN General As sembly for adoption. The United States par ticipated actively in the drafting of the con vention. We believe that it represents a no table step forward in the needed promotion  and protection of the rights of children. Al though the convention is far from perfect no agreement ever  is-the United States  strongly believes in the enumerated commit ments and goals of the convention, and it is  our hope that the General Assembly will  adopt the text without change.  The Government of Poland deserves much  of the credit for the conclusion of this con vention. The version we have before us  today represents many years of debate and  revisions  to  the Government of Poland's  first draft; but if it were not for the initial  ",1990
139,882,1,Mr. MOAKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, by di rection of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 309 and ask  for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the resolution, as fol lows:  H. RES. 309  Resolved, That at any time after the adop tion of  this  resolution  the Speaker may,  pursuant to clause l<b) of rule XXIII, de clare the House resolved into the Commit tee of the Whole House on the State of the  Union for the consideration of the bill <H.R.  2190) to establish national voter registration  procedures for elections for Federal office,  and for other purposes, and the first read ing of the bill shall be dispensed with. After  general debate, which shall be confined to  the bill and which shall not exceed one  hour, to be equally div1ded and controlled  by  the  chairman  and  ranking minority  member of the Committee on House Admin istration,  the bill shall be considered for  amendment under the five-minute rule. In  lieu of the amendments now printed in the  bill,  it shall be  in order  to consider an  amendment in the nature of a substitute  consisting of the text of the amendment  printed in the report of the Committee on  Rules accompanying this resolution as an  original bill for the purpose of amendment  under the five-minute rule, and said substi tute shall be considered as having been  read. No amendment to said substitute shall  be in order except the amendments printed  in the Congressional Record on or before  February 5, 1990, by and if offered by, Rep resentative. Michel of Illinois, or his desig nee, said amendments shall be considered en  bloc  and  shall be debatable  for not  to  exceed one hour, equally divided and con trolled by the proponent and a Member op posed  thereto. Said amendments en bloc  shall not be subject  to amendment, and  shall not be subject to a demand for a divi sion of the question in the House or in the  Committee of the Whole. At the conclusion  of the consideration of the bill for amend ment, the Committee shall rise and report  the bill to the House with such amendments  as may have been adopted, and any Member  may demand a separate vote in the House  on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the amend ment in the nature of a substitute made in  order as original text by this resolution. The  previous question shall be considered as or dered on the bill and amendments thereto  to final passage without intervening motion  except one motion  to  recommit with or  without instructions.  The SPEAKER pro  tempore <Mr.  DURBIN). The gentleman from Massa chusetts [Mr. MOAKLEY]  is recognized  for 1 hour.  ",1990
140,882,1,Mr. MOAKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gen tleman  from Tennessee  [Mr. QUIL LEN].  pending which  I  yield myself  such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 309  is a modified closed rule providing for  the consideration of the bill H.R. 2190,  the National Voter Registration Act of  1989.  The rule provides 1 hour of general  debate, equally divided and controlled  between the chairman and ranking mi nority member of the Committee on  House Administration.  Mr. Speaker, the rule makes in order  the amendment in the nature of a sub stitute consisting of the text printed in  the report accompanying this resolu tion. The amendment shall be consid ered as original text for the purpose of  amendment, and shall be considered as  having been read.  The rule further provides that no  amendments to the substitute are to  be  in order except  the amendments  printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  on or before February 5, 1990, to be of fered by  the distinguished Minority  Leader, Representative MICHEL or his  designee.  The amendments shall be considered  en bloc and shall be debatable for 1  hour, with the time equally divided be tween the proponent and a Member  opposed thereto.  Mr. Speaker,  the amendments en  bloc shall not be subject to amend ment or to a demand for a division of  the question in the House or in the  Committee of the Whole.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, House Resolu tion 309 provides one motion to recom mit with or without instructions.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2190, the National  Voter Registration Act would create a  national voter registration procedure  for election of Federal offices. The re sponsibility for the implementation of  the  system would  fall within  the  States, with the Federal Government  responsible for enforcement, as well as  financial and technical assistance.  Under this bill, States that require  registration would  provide  uniform  methods to enable voters to register to  vote. The first method is the so-called  motor-voter procedure, this procedure  would allow for voters to register to  vote when they apply for a driver's li cense.  The second method would require  each State to make available a form  that applicants could mail to an election official and be eligible to vote in  Federal elections.  The  final method would  require  States to designate some Government  locations, as well as private sector lo cations that would distribute and col  lect applications for registration.  Mr. Speaker, in order to assure that  voter  registration  lists are accurate  and current, H.R. 2190 would require  States to update and verify registra tion lists by providing non-forwardable  mailings every 2 years  to registered  voters or by obtaining information on  address changes from the U.S. Postal  Service.  Mr. Speaker, in the 1988 Presidential  election, barely 50 percent of the elec torate voted, this was the lowest voter  turnout in 64 years. One of the pri mary reasons given by non-voters was  that they were not registered. This bill  that the House will soon consider will  not only increase the opportunity for  eligible citizens to register to vote, but  also open the electoral process to all  citizens.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  adopt this rule and support the final  passage of H.R. 2190.  0 1310  ",1990
141,882,1,Mr. QUILLEN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  the main purpose of  the voter registration bill is supposed  . to be to make it easier for people to  vote.  In that spirit, yesterday in the Rules  Committee, I offered an open rule in  order to make it easier for Members to  vote on amendments to the voter reg istration bill. But instead of welcoming  my proposal to allow Members to vote,  the Rules Committee by a party-line  vote turned down my open rule pro posal and  instead reported  the rule  before us today, which closes off all  amemdnents except for one package to  be considered en bloc. There  is no  shortage of amendments to be consid eredr In the Rules Committee yester day,  the gentlewoman from Nevada,  [Mrs. VUCANOVICH] asked to have an  amendment made  in order to insure  that this legislation would not burden  the States with a  lot of extra costs.  The gentleman  from Colorado  [Mr.  HEFLEY]  presented  three  separate  amendments. One was designed to en hance voter participation. A  second  was designed to ensure that voter reg istration rolls are accurate. A  third  would protect the integrity of the elec toral process.  Mr. Speaker, these are all reasonable  proposals which deserve to be consid ered separately on their merits, not  jammed into an en bloc package where  only one vote will be allowed on a  large group of amendments.  And certainly opponents of a closed  rule cannot argue with a straight face  that we need to limit amendments be",1990
142,895,1,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, at  the outset I would like to thank the  gentleman from New York for having  this subject discussed today. I think it  is a very timely issue.  Mr. Speaker,  the winds of change  are blowing around the world. From  the Soviet Union to Eastern Europe,  democracy is on the move along with a  growing respect for justice and human  rights. The Berlin Wall, once thought  to be a permanent fixture dividing the  free world and the Soviet empire, has  crumbled  into  souvenirs.  Impressive  progress is also being made in resolv ing  the problems of South Africa,  Angola, Cambodia, and Central Amer ica. One problem, however, seems to  resist resolution. One dilemma resists  the application of fairness, justice, and  sensitivity to human rights. Cyprus is  that problem.  Since 1974,  the tragedy of Cyprus  has been with us. The cruel Turkish  invasion of  that  island  caused  the  death of thousands. Over 1,600 Greek  Cypriots are still missing along with a  number of American citizens. One of  them  is Andrew Kassapis,  a  young  Michigan residenf who was taken from  his family's home on Cyprus and never  seen again.  That military action resulted in the  displacement of 200,000 Greek Cypri ots who became refugees in their own  land. When they were forced out of  the northern part of the island, they  left behind land, homes, and personal  property worth millions  of  dollars.  Some of that property has been carted  off to Turkey. None of those families  have been compensated for their huge  losses.  In addition to illegally occupying the  northern tier of Cyprus with 30,000  troops, who  are  still  armed with  United  States  supplied  equipment,  Turkey dispatched 60,000 Anatolian  settlers to the island. Even the Turk ish Cypriots  resent  the presence of  those ""non Cypriots"" on  that once united island. What is being done to  solve the Cyprus problem?  The United Nations-sponsored inter communal talks broke down  in July  when Mr. Denktash objected to how  the United Nations presented a draft  outline to him. The outline provided  food for thought about how the talks  should proceed and how the two par ties to the dispute could work together  to settle the dispute. In recent weeks,  Secretary General Perez de Cuellar in vited both Mr. Denktash and Presi dent Vassiliou  of  the Republic  of  Cyprus  to  the United Nations  for  talks. Again, Mr. Denktash was offend ed by the way in which the Secretary  General  issued  the  invitation. Presi dent Vassiliou, who has shown amaz ing  flexibility and determination  to  pursue peace talks, willingly accepted  the  invitation. Mr. Denktash should  worry more about solving the Cyprus  problem  and  less  about  diplomatic  niceties. This is the time for forward  movement  in  the peace  process  if  there is ever going to be peace on that  divided island.  The key  to peace on Cyprus  is  in  Ankara. It is time for Turkish authori ties to talk with Mr. Denktash about  the reality of Cyprus and the need to  settle that longstanding problem.  As  the gentleman pointed out, we  ought to be looking at the amount of  money we are giving Turkey. In fact, I  would like to see it sharply reduced to  be used as leverage, as the gentleman  talked about, to force the two parties  to get together to resolve these issues.  As changes occur at breakneck speed  around the world, Turkish and Turk ish Cypriot authorities are increasing ly seen by  the world community as  dragging  their  feet on  a  fair  and  timely resolution of the Cyprus con flict. Turkey  is  the only democratic  nation in Europe that has its troops  occupying a  foreign country. Turkey  wants to join the European Communi ty, but surely must realize that Eu rope's  doors will  be  closed  until  Ankara makes progress on the Cyprus  problem.  It is  time  to  resolve  the  Cyprus dilemma and make the green  line part of history along with  the  Berlin Wall. It is time to aim for the  goals set by President Bush a  few  years ago when he said, ""We seek for  Cyprus  a  constitutional  democracy  based on majority rule, the rule of law,  and the protection of minority rights.""  I urge my colleagues to work togeth er with me in Congress to bring about  a peaceful  resolution of  the Cyprus  problem.  Until  there  is  honest  progress made on a resolution of that  problem, Congress should ensure that  ",1990
143,908,1,The PRESIDENT.," Mr.  President,  Mr. Speaker, Members of  the  lOlst  Congress, fell ow citizens: I return as a  former President of the Senate, and  former member of this great House.  Now, as President, it is my privilege to  report  to you on  the State of  the  Union.  Tonight, I come not to speak about  the ""state of the government"" -not to  detail every new initiative we plan for  the coming year, nor to describe every  line item in the budget. I'm here to  speak  to you and  to  the American  people about the State of the Union about our world-the changes we've  seen, the challenges we face. And what  that means for America. There are sin gular moments in history: dates that  divide all  that goes before from all  that comes after. Many of us in this  chamber have lived much of our lives  in a world whose  fundamental  f ea tures were defined in 1945. The events  of that year decreed the shape of na tions. The pace of progress. Freedom  or oppression for millions of people  around the world.  1945 provided the common frame of  reference-the compass points of the  post-war era we've relied upon to un derstand  ourselves. That was  our  world. Until now. The events of the  year  just  ended-the  revolution  of  '89-have been  a  chain  reaction change so striking that it marks the  beginning of a new era in the world's  affairs.  Think  back-just  twelve  short  months ago-to the world we knew-as  1989 began.  One year ago, the people of Panama  lived in fear, under the thumb of a dic tator. Today, democracy is restored Panama is free.  Operation  ""Just  Cause""  has  achieved its objective. The number of  military personnel in Panama is now  very close to what it was before the  operation began. And tonight, I am an nouncing that-well before the end of  February-the additional numbers of  American troops-the brave men and  women of our Armed Forces who made  this mission a  success-will be back  home.  A year ago in Poland, Lech Walesa  declared that he was ready to open a  dialog with the communist rulers of  that country. Today, with the future  of a free Poland in their own hands,  members of Solidarity lead the Polish  Government.  A year ago,  freedom's playwright,  Vaclav Havel, languished as a prisoner  in Prague. Today, it's Vaclav Havel President of Czechoslovakia.  And one year ago, Erich Honecker of  East Germany claimed history as his  guide. He predicted the Berlin Wall  would  last  another hundred  years.  Today-less than one year later-it's  the Wall that's history.  Remarkable events-events that ful fill the long-held hopes of the Ameri can people. Events that validate the  long-standing  goals  of  American  policy-a policy based on  a  single,  shining principle:  the cause of free dom.  America-not  just  the Nation-but  an idea, alive in the minds of people  everywhere. As this new world takes  shape, America stands at the center of  a widening circle of freedom-today,  tomorrow, and into the next century.  Our Nation is the enduring dream of  every immigrant who ever set foot on  these  shores-and  the millions  still  struggling  to be free. This Nation this  idea  called America-was  and  always will be-a new world. Our new  world.  At a workers' rally-in a place called  Branik on the outskirts of Prague the  idea called America  is alive. A  worker, dressed in grimy overalls, rises  to  speak at  the  factory  gates. He  begins his speech to his fell ow citizens  with .these words-words of a distant  revolution:  ""We hold these truths to be self-evi dent. That all men are created equal,  that they are endowed by their Cre ator with certain unalienable rights,  [andl that among these are life, liber ty and the pursuit of happiness.""  It's no secret that, here at home,  freedom's door opened long ago. The  cornerstones of this free society have  already been set in place: Democracy.  Competition. Opportunity. Private in vestment. Stewardship. And of course,  leadership.  Our challenge today is to take this  democratic system of ours-a system  second to none-and make it better.  A better America, where  there's a  job for everyone who wants one.  Where women working outside the  home can be confident their children  are in safe and loving care-and where  government works  to  expand child  care alternatives for parents.  Where we reconcile the needs of a  clean environment and a strong econo my.  Where ""Made in the U.S.A."" is rec ognized  around  the world  as  the  symbol of quality and progress.  Where every one of us enjoys the  same opportunities  to  live,  to work,  and  to  contribute  to  society. And  where, for the first time, the American  mainstream  includes all of our dis abled citizens.  Where everyone has a roof over his  head-and where the homeless get the  help they need to live in dignity.  Where our  schools  challenge and  support our kids and our teachers and where all of them make the grade.  Where every street, every city, every  school, and every child is drug-free.  And finally, where no American is  forgotten. Our hearts go out to our  hostages-our hostages who are cease lessly on our minds and in our efforts.  That's part of the future we want to  see-the future we can make for our selves. But dreams alone won't get us  there. We need  to extend our hori zon-commit  to  the  long-view. Our  mission for the future starts today.  In the  tough, competitive markets  around the world, America faces great  challenges  and  great  opportunities.  We know that we can succeed in the  global economic arena of the nineties,  but to meet that challenge we must  make  some  fundamental  changes some crucial investments in ourselves.  Yes-we are going to invest in Amer ica. This Administration is determined  to encourage the creation of capital capital of all kinds. Physical capital:  Everything, from our farms and facto ries to our workshops and production  lines, all that is needed to produce and  deliver quality goods and quality serv ices. Intellectual capital: The source of  ideas that spark tomorrow's products.  And of course, our human capital: The  talented workforce we'll need to com pete in the global market.  And let me  tell you. If we  ignore  human capital-we lose the spirit of  American ingenuity-the spirit that is  the hallmark of the American worker.  That would be bad. And the American  worker is the most productive worker  in the world.  We need to save more-we need to  expand the pool of capital for the new  investments  that mean more  jobs,  more growth. That's the idea behind a  new initiative I call the Family Sav ings Plan, which I will send  to  the  Congress tomorrow.  We need to cut the tax on capital  gains-encourage risk-takers-especial ly  those  in our small businesses-to  take  those steps  that translate  into  economic reward,  jobs, and a better  life for all of us.  We'll do what it takes to invest in  America's future. The budget commit ment is there. The money is there. It's  there for Research and Development,  R&D-a record high. It's there for our  housing initiative-HOPE, to help ev eryone from first-time homebuyers to  the homeless. The money's there  to  keep our kids drug-free: 70 percent  more than when I took office in 1989.  It's there for space exploration-and  it's  there  for  education:  another  record high.  ",1990

146,934,1,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, with  respect to our clean air bill, the Com mittee on Environment  and Public  Works, and most particularly our dis tinguished manager here, the Senator  from Montana  [Mr. BAucusJ  and  I  have  been  in  conference. We  are  trying to  teach an understanding so  there will not be a misunderstanding.  What really occurred, and brought  the global change issue to the fore for  me, was that sometime early last year,  having traveled down to the Antarctic  and gotten  to  the South Pole and  looked up at the atmosphere  there,  and seeing the hole in the atmosphere  that they speak of,  I  realized better  than anyone that there were many in terested  parties  in  this  particular  problem of global warming and that  what we really needed was a consum mate kind of coordinated endeavor by  the Government,  in all departments  and agencies, whatever their jurisdic tion or  responsibility,  to coordinate  and periodically  report  to  the Con gress. Then we would know what is to  be ruled on and to be regulated and  controlled. The latter is principally, of  course, in the Environment and Public  Works Committee.  During that Antarctic trip, it was a  NOAA, National Oceanic and Atmos pheric Administration, scientist who  was pointing out the ozone hole. Inci dentally,  there were bells ringing in  the sun. We have not found out how  or why. We were watching all of this  occur.  We were down there with the Na tional Science Foundation, and we also  had authorities there from NASA, the  space agency. NASA, NOAA, and the  National  Science  Foundation,  of  course, are within our Commerce, Sci ence and Transportation Committee.  Regarding S. 169, once we checked  with  the Environmental Protection  Agency, with both sides of the aisle,  with the White House and all the de partments and agencies, we reconciled  any differences we had learned about,  and we ordered that bill reported in  April. The bill has been on the calen dar, ready to pass.  ",1990
147,947,1,Mr. NICKLES.," If the Senator will  yield  for  just a quick question. He  mentioned residual risks, that there is  a drop dead provision, and if they do  not meet that requirement, the 1 in  10,000, if they are not able to reduce  below  that  level,  that plant would  have to shut down by the year 2005, I  think you said, would be the first year.  The year for the tier 2 reductions in  auto emissions is 2003. My statement  and my plea would be: Why do we not  do  the first part of this bill, pass a  clean air bill, and then in 1997 let us  look at tier 2 on auto emissions, let us  look at residual risks, after we have  had a chance to analyze a few years of  experience for the maximum achieva ble controllable  technology and  the  tier 1 tailpipe standards?  In other words,  let us not pass in  this bill what we do not really know  how to define, what is going to happen  on auto emissions by the year 2003  and residual risks by the year 2005.  Let us pass what at least we think we  can do now.  Basically this is the approach taken  in  the administration's proposal on  emissions and on  toxics,  let us pass  those phases now and let us take an other look in 1997 or maybe 1996 and  see what kind of progress we have  made,  see what  is  achievable. Why  pass something now, my question is to  the Senator, that is setting drop dead  dates to firms  if they cannot invent  certain technology by the year 2005?  Why set mandates now on the auto in dustry that are really expensive-esti mates vary-or currently impossible to  meet by the year 2003? Why do we not  look at that again 6 or 7 years from  now?  ",1990
148,947,1,Mr. BAUCUS.," The answer  to  the  Senator  from  Oklahoma  is  quite  simple. This is not easy stuff. I mean  it is hard to know. We cannot predict  the future with precision. Nobody can.  I am sure the Senator from Oklahoma  knows-and perhaps he does not-that  there are about 960  toxic chemicals,  about 960. The EPA, in the 19 years  that it has tried to develop standards  for regulating air toxics, has only de veloped standards for 7 out of the 960.  In 19 years, EPA has only developed  standards  for  7 out of 960. EPA's  record is poor. It has not been done.  Why is EPA's record so poor? Essen tially, in my judgment, it is so poor be cause interest groups just bang away  at the EPA and prevent the EPA from  getting the job done. That is a  large  part of it. In addition,  the standard  under law is met. The standard of cur rent law basically is the residual risk  of one out of infinity. For all intents  and purposes it is zero. And that is  very tough to meet. That is part of the  problem.  The alternative  the administration  suggests to residual risks, is what they  call unreasonable risks. Well, the prob lem under unreasonable risks is it is  the same standard used in TSCA an  FIFRA and under those two statutes  only one pollutant has been  recog nized in 14 years. Therefore, we are  trying to find a standard which in fact  will get the job done.  I  submit  it  is  reasonable. Twenty eight States use  this procedure; 28  States use residual risk. In addition,  that 1 in 10,000 standard is a standard  that is applied  to Superfund  today;  that is, if a Superfund site results in 1  out of 10,000 risk of cancer, it has to  be cleaned up.  So all I am saying in answer to the  Senator's question why act today, act  today because there has been inaction  in the last 19 years. We have to get on  with it. We have to find some way to  get the job done. The standard which  the administration suggests to get on  with it is, for all intents and purposes,  the current regime, the current frame work. That is why the committee be lieves  that  the administration's ap proach is insufficient. There is just too  much  discretionary  authority,  too  much discretion given to the EPA, and  too many interest groups that prevent  the agency from taking action.  ",1990
149,947,1,Mr. NICKLES.," My concern,  if the  Senator would yield for a final com ment, my concern is we are going too  far  in  these outyear reaches. These  are  really objectionable  to  industry  groups, the administration and so on. I  am concerned that we are going too  far and we are going to find that out  in a few years and have to come back  and undo some of it.  Many of us are going  to be here  probably in 1997, I expect, with some  institutional memory. Maybe we could  learn from what we did right in the  1990 clean air bill and expand upon it  and avoid some of the mistakes that  we might be making by trying to write  a bill that is going to go well into the  next couple of decades.  ",1990
150,947,1,Mr. BAUCUS.," If I might say to the  Senator from Oklahoma, the Congress  enacted  higher,  tighter  automobile  emissions standards for automobiles,  the Congress set high standards for  hydrocarbons, for nitrogen oxides, and  for carbon monoxide.  What happened? As  I mentioned  earlier,  the  auto  industry met  the  standards, found out a way to meet  the standards for hydrocarbons and  for carbon monoxide, but came back  and told the Congress that the stand ards  for nitrogen oxides-they  just  could not meet them.  Congress agreed and rolled back that  standard.  What I am saying is this: We have to  make  the best  judgment we can  to  help move our country along to get air  as clean as reasonably possible but as  quickly as possible. We have to make  our best  judgments. We will make  some mistakes when we pass this stat ute. No statute is perfect. But I submit  if we pass legislation that takes effect  in the outyears,  in the main we are  going to be on target. And, frankly, I  think we probably will not have gone  far enough.  As the Senator well knows, Calif or nia now is enacting a still third round  of  tailpipe emissions. So the second  round of this bill is really the middle  position.  But, if we have gone too far-and I  submit we will not have gone too far,  in many cases not far enough-if in  fact after several years it is clear we  have gone too far, based upon past his tory the industry can come in and say  we have gone to far. Based upon past  history with nitrogen oxides of auto mobile tailpipe emissions, the evidence  is the Congress will go back and cor rect it.  So I think that is what we have to  do. Go as far as we reasonably can. I  know that is the way the Senator con ducts his office, conducts his life. He  pushes himself as far as he can. If he  goes too far, he backs off a  little to  adjust.  ",1990
151,947,1,Mr. NICKLES.," I might tell the Sen ator, I do not make decisions pending  on the year 2003 and 2005, and I doubt  that many people do, and I doubt that  that many businesses do. I am afraid  we are reaching a little far in years in  mandates.  I appreciate the Senator's efforts. I  knew that was his position. That is the  reason why it is in the bill and sup ported by many.  But I also will off er this. The addi tional tier 2 standards on auto emis sions and the residual risk provisions  that go well into the next decade are a  couple of the provisions that are caus ing  major  consternation  amongst  people who have really examined this  bill, including the administration.  If Senators really want to get a bill  through the Senate, and one that will  be signed by the President, I think it  would really behoove them to think in  the context of ""let us pass a reasona ble bill now"". Then,  if we want  to  make further  improvements later  in  this decade, I am sure we can do so at  that time.  ",1990
152,947,1,Mr. BAUCUS.," The  point  I was  making is the Senator, I know, sets the  highest  possible  personal  standards  that he can for himself. I just suggest  we, too, in the Senate, set the highest  possible standards. I thank the Sena tor.  ",1990

155,986,1,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker,  in opposition  to  the recent surge of approval for the Canadian  Health Care Program, I would like to emphaEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  size the resulting  loss of quality care for pa tients in need of immediate attention. The illu sion in Canada, that theirs is essentially a free  system, is driving both doctors and patients to  the borders.  I believe any cost-effective pro gram orchestrated by the Government is real istically going  to be more concerned with  meeting  the guidelines and  restrictions set  forth  on paper  rather  than  caring  for  the  needs of a particular patient.  The following article by Leona Rubin Kras now, ""'Free' Health Care Doesn't Mean Qual ity Health Care,"" illustrates the frustration and  cost  of  coping with  the  faulty Canadian  system. Her  experience with  childbirth  in  Canada began with overcrowded clinics and  not being able  to see a doctor, and ended  after she had endured 57 hours of labor, a  Caesarean section, and five different doctors.  Not only was she  lacking  information about  prenatal care and counseling, but she  later  came to the United States where she was di agnosed with having anemia. The difference  between our  two systems,  it seems,  is not  merely financial. Our health is a dear price to  pay for what some call a cost-effective gov ernment health plan.  FREE HEALTH CARE DOESN'T MEAN QUALITY  HEALTH CARE  <By Leona Rubin Krasnow)  The U.S. media are stressing the advan tages of the Canadian health-care system.  Those who have received medical care in  Canada know that the media are mistaken.  A segment of a  recent MacNeil/Lehrer  NewsHour  dealt with  a  comparison  of  health  care  in  the United States  and  Canada. The program seemed to stress that  U.S. health care is not cost-effective. Mean while, Canadian patients interviewed for the  show were happy to receive ""free"" and, in  their opinion, adequate medical care from  their government.  I lived in Canada for a year-and-a-half and  had my  first child  there. The Canadian  system was inadequate in several areas, in cluding prenatal care and counseling, man agement of labor and delivery, and postna tal followup. I saw a physician only twice in  nine months; first  to confirm that I was  pregnant and later so medication could be  prescribed to combat swelling in my hands  and legs.  The common procedure in Canada was for  a pregnant woman to visit a clinic once a  month. The clinics always were crowded,  and waiting periods of three to four hours  were common. I got the impression that the  doctors and other medical personnel were  not personally involved in my welfare. To  them, I was just a number in the waiting  room.  When I went to the hopsital to have my  baby, I was wheeled into the delivery room  and back into the labor room three times.  During the 57 hours I was in labor, I was at tended by five different physicians; whoever  was on call was my doctor.  My care was not totally free. My husband  received a phone bill for $3.57 because he  called an obstetrician in Sudbury to ask his  advice. The specialist recommended a Cae sarean section. When I awoke from the an esthetic, hospital personnel wouldn't allow  me to see my baby. They said I couldn't be  moved yet and that the infant was in an in cubator. I was sure that he had died until  they brought him to me the next day.  Two weeks later, I went to the clinic. My  baby and I spent five or six minutes with  January 31, 1990  the surgeon, who checked us briefly and  gave me a pamphlet about baby care. That  was our final visit. If I had problems or  questions, I could call a doctor, but only be tween 4:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. Since everyone  tried to call during that time period, it was  practically impossible to get through. In an  emergency, I was to go to the hospital emer gency  room.  However,  as  a  first-time  mother, I sometimes had a simple question  about diaper rash or some other common  problem;  it would have been nice  just to  have someone knowledgeable to talk to.  I was extremely tjred for weeks, but I as sumed that my fatigue was caused by my  difficult labor and Caesarean section. When  ny son was five months old, we took him to  New York  to meet his grandparents. My  mother said I looked terribly pale and took  me  to her doctor. He  found  that I was  anemic, and he was shocked that none of  my Canadian doctors had done a blood test  or prescribed iron pills for me. He also was  surprised that none of those physicians told  me that I might need a Caesarean section  because my pelvis was small.  Indeed, my  mother and older sister had required Cae sarean sections for the same reason.  I realized the difference between the U.S.  and Canadian health-care systems when I  had my second baby in the United States. I  didn't have to wait three hours every month  to see my obstetrician. He was patient, reas suring and understanding; he made me feel  like a special person. I knew he would be  there for me when my time came. I also had  a wonderful pediatrician whom I could call  any time to ask questions about the baby.  Next week, I have to go to the hospital for  a cervical biopsy. My doctor apologized for  delaying this procedure one week because  he was going on vacation. I would have had  to wait much longer if the United States  had a socialized medical-care system similar  to that in Canada. I have every confidence  in my doctor and in the care I will receive. I  never will return to Canada's nightmarish  health-care system, even if it is free.  MILITARY TRASH INTO CASH  HON.

156,986,1,Mr. PACKARD.," Mr. Speaker, I want to rec ognize the success of a Federal statute, sec tion 2577, title 10, United States Code, which  provides incentives for military bases to estab lish effective waste recycling programs. That  law, passed by  the 97th Congress, allows a  military installation to keep the proceeds from  the sale of waste materials. The  revenues  generated from such sales may be spent by  the base commander on: Morale, welfare, and  recreation  programs;  pollution  abatement;  energy conservation; and occupational safety  and health activities.  Since  this  law's enactment many bases  have improved their recycling efforts reducing  our waste stream, preventing pollution, and  conserving natural resources.

TOM CAMPBELL  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 31, 1990  ",1990
158,999,1,Mr. CAMPBELL of California.," Mr. Speaker,  last fall  it was necessary for me to return to  California after  the Loma Prieta earthquake.  Consequently,  I was not able to cast a vote  on four issues which came before the House.  It has recently come to my attention that my  preferences on  those bills had not been  re corded. Hence, I would now like to clarify, for  the  record, how  I would have voted had  I  been present.  The first vote was rollcall 292, pertaining to  H.R.  3299,  the budget  reconciliation bill.  I  would have voted  in  favor of  the Frenzel  motion  to  instruct  the House conferees  to  recede from the House position on provisions  that would  lose revenue,  increase spending,  or have no budget effect. The repeals of the  Catastrophic Coverage Act and section 89  employee-benefits were excepted.  I believe  that  the Frenzel motion would have been  good budgeting and a positive step  toward  achieving the budget reconciliation goal.  The second vote, rollcall 293, was passage  of H.R. 2494,  international development and  finance authorization.  I believe  that  the bill  provided  for too great a potential  for simple  dole-kind of aid to foreign nations with no re quirement  for adequate economic  infrastruc ture. My vote would have been no.  The third vote, rollcall 294, pertained to the  cargo preference requirements in H.R. 3402,  aid  to Poland and Hungary.  I would have  voted  for  the  substitution  to  the Grandy  amendment. The substitution would have re sulted in a reduction in the percentage, from  75 to 50, of United States food-aid shipments  to Poland required  to be shipped on United  Stated  flag-merchant  ships.  Cargo  prefer ences have the dual effect of increasing the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  cost of the aid and  lessening the amount of  money which can be used for the actual aid.  The beneficiaries of such a policy are a very  small group of U.S. shipowners and their em ployees. The provision is anticompetitive and  in a very real sense takes food money away  from hungry people who need it.  The last vote, rollcall 295, was passage of  H.R. 3402, aid to Poland and Hungary. I would  have voted yes for the bill. However, I would  have preferred less money for direct govern mental subsidy and more for capitalistic incen tives.  ROSA PARKS-AMERICA'S  FREEDOM CHAMPION  HON.

LOUIS STOKES  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 31, 1990  ",1990
160,999,1,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker, last November, I  was appointed to serve on the Harvard AIDS  Institute Advisory Council. The council is com posed of concerned leaders who will be ac tively supporting the work of the institute in its  effort to bring AIDS to the forefront of national  attention and to provide new perspectives on  the AIDS crisis. The goals of the institute in clude  the development of an AIDS vaccine,  the prevention of the further spread of the epi demic, and helping developing countries  re spond to the epidemic.  During the advisory council's initial meeting,  Dr. June E. Osborn, who serves as chairman  of the National Commission on AIDS and also  as dean of the University of Michigan School  of Public Health, delivered a thoughtful and in sightful speech entitled,  ""AIDS  in  the Year  2000."" Dr. Osborn's remarks addressed  the  cultural, social, and political aspects of  the  AIDS epidemic. Her comments on our coun try's health care system and the social conse quences of the growing AIDS epidemic seem  particularly relevant as we begin our legisla tive session.  I am pleased to share Dr. Osborn's remarks  with my colleagues and hope they will take a  moment to consider her analysis:  AIDS IN THE YEAR 2000  <By June E. Osborn, M.D.)  I  am not much of a  futurist, and  the  charge to anticipate vistas of the year 2000  has caused me considerable unease in the  past. It still does-but the peculiar traits of  the human immunodeficiency virus make it  unpleasantly easy to offer some predictions.  As our insight sharpens, the median interval  between onset of  infection and advent of  AIDS keeps growing  longer. For a while  there, during the past couple of years, the  consensus about average time elapsed from  infection with HIV  to diagnosis of AIDS  seemed to have settled at 7 years. The fra gility of that figure was intuitively obvious,  since the epidemic has been recognized for  only 8 years; but I clung tightly to it, taking  heart from modelers who seemed to rein force the epidemiologists, and hoping that  ongoing studies would soon show curves to  be peaking or leveling off <or whatever>.  I am afraid my optimism had the better of  me, for recently it is becoming clear that  the likely interval is 10 or even 11 years.  Since that is the median interval, there will  be many people who will  take  longer  to  become ill; indeed, there is good news from  the AZT front that suggests that we may be  able to extend the duration of asymptomat ic HIV infection even further. And  if all  that is true, we aren't really being futurists  when we discuss people who will be caught  up  in the epidemic by the year 2000.  In  point of fact, we are talking about people  who became infected last week!  Of course, there is not as much informa tion as one would like, ideally, to tell us how  many of them there are. We have only gen eral descriptive clues about who they are.  On the positive side, we have the knowledge  that might allow us to stop further spread  next week, which would surely help mat",1990

THE CONTINUED DELAY  IN  IM PLEMENTING THE WETLANDS  PROTECTION AGREEMENT BE TWEEN THE CORPS OF ENGI NEERS AND THE ENVIRONMEN TAL PROTECTION AGENCY  ",1990
163,1025,1,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President,  a  long-awaited  wetlands  protection  agreement between the EPA and the  Army Corps of Engineers was to have  gone into effect yesterday.  Plans  to carry out  this  landmark  agreement have been suspended twice  since it was signed on November 14,  1989.  Now,  implementation of  the wet lands accord has been postponed yet  again.  The agreement between  the EPA  and the Department of the Army ar ticulates the policy and procedures to  be used in determining the type and  level of mitigation necessary to comply  with the environmental requirements  for wetlands filling under section 404  of the Clean Water Act.  The Army and the EPA have dis agreed for years over wetlands mitiga tion policy and procedures.  The agreement signed last Novem ber was  the culmination of efforts  that began with oversight hearings  before  the Senate Subcommittee on  Environmental Pollution during 1985  and 1986.  At that time, the EPA insisted that  the section 404 environmental criteria  for issuing wetlands development per mits required that adverse impacts to  wetlands, must be first avoided if pos sible,  then minimized and, as a  last  resort, compensated for  through the  creation  or  restoration  of  similar  aquatic resources.  The corps previously had  resisted  this policy and instead had left its dis tricts with broad discretion to negoti ate mitigation requirements on a case by-case basis.  Finally, late last year-due in large  part to the efforts of EPA Administra tor William Reilly and Assistant Ad ministrator LaJuana Wilcher and the  Assistant Secretary of the Army for  Civil Works, Robert Page-the  two  agencies  responsible  for  administra tion of the section 404 program agreed  to  the  sequential  consideration  of  avoidance, minimization and compen sation of adverse impacts in reviewing  permit applications for wetlands fill ing.  The agreement needs to be put into  effect without further delay to ensure  that the Clean Water Act  is carried  out uniformly in a manner that en courages the protection of wetlands in  their natural state and helps prevent  the net loss of these valuable aquatic  resources.  The policy guidance agreed to by the  corps and EPA  last November pre serves  the  integrity  of  the Clean  Water Act's  environmental  criteria  which permit wetlands  filling  only  where it is the least damaging practi cable alternative. Alternatives to wet lands filling are presumed to be less  damaging and available  for projects  that  do  not  require  proximity  to  water.  This analysis of alternatives and re buttal  of  presumptions must  take  place under the agreement regardless  of any off er  to restore, enhance or  construct wetlands  as  compensation  for the effects of the requested filling.  In this manner, the agreement en sures that section 404 of the Clean  Water Act is not used as a means of  providing for the orderly destruction  of the Nation's wetlands.

171,1103,1,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, William Korey, di rector of international policy research for B'nai  B'rith, has written an article in the New York  Times warning  of pogroms against Soviet  Jews.  I believe our colleagues will  find his  views both informative and disturbing. At this  point, I wish to enter his article into the CON GRESSIONAL RECORD.  A FEAR OF POGROMS HAUNTS SOVIET JEWS  <By William Korey)  At the historic Congress of Jewish Organi zations held in Moscow  in December, the  most talked-about worry was the real possi bility of pogroms in the near future. This  month's slaughter of Aremenians by Azer baijanis in Baku, which has repeatedly been  described as a pogrom, suggests that during  the nationalist unrest  across  the Soviet  Union Jews could again become mob vic tims. Thus, Jews, recalling the bad old czar ist days, are particularly worried by  the  Kremlin's continued cold silence about their  fears.  When delegates from 126 Jewish cultural  organizations  in 70  cities assembled,  the  most important speech stressed a ""sharp up surge of public anti-Semitism,"" which is the  flip side of glasnost.  Severe economic dislocations and political  instability,  the analysis noted,  aggravate  tensions and permit the Jew to be a scape goat for the problems of perestroika.  WISE WORDS OF ADVICE  ON  THE  REAL MIKHAIL GORBA CHEV  Thursday, February 1, 1990  ",1990
172,1103,1,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, during a  recent speech at Time Magazine's ""Man of  the Year"" dinner,  former President Richard  Nixon analyzed the real Mikhail Gorbachev his goals, his power, his weaknesses and his  challenges. The historic events of  the past  year are  incredible and Mr. Gorbachev has  played a major role in their continued unfold ing. Unfortunately, some  in  the West have  become  carried  away with  ""Gorby-mania""  and, to borrow President Nixon's analogy, are  thinking  too much with  their hearts and not  their heads. These are time of great hope, but  they are also  times with difficult challenges  demanding strong,  level headed  leadership  and policy.  I strongly suggest that my colleagues care fully study President Nixon's very  insightful  analysis. After examining his comments, I be lieve others will agree with me that President  Nixon's points are very much on the mark and  worth  incorporating  into  our  thinking  and  policy for the new decade.  [From the Washington Times, Jan. 31,  Documentation was not difficult to come  by; more  than 50 desecrations of Jewish  cemeteries, some 1,000 anti-Semitic rallies,  and vitriolic hate leaflets in the thousands  distributed everywhere. Moreover, some 60  goons from Pamyat, a chauvinist Russian  national movement, greeted the delegates  with cries of ""Yid!"" and ""Jewish prostitute!""  Beyond  these  hate-spewing  vulgarities,  and reinforcing  them,  is  the defense and  promotion  of  Pamyat  and  anti-Jewish  stereotypes by prominent and conservative  nationalist publications.  Then, too, there are newly formed patriot ic and religious organizations that would os tracize the Jew as ""alien"" and ""cosmopoli tan"" <a resurrected Stalinist era code word  meaning ""traitor""), and populist novelists  fill their books and essays with flagrant ap peals to bigotry.  Only the Young Communist League news paper has carried as Cassandralike warning.  Written by  the Lithuanian Jewish writer  Grigory Kanovich, a member of the Con gress of People's Deputies, the article de scribed ""clouds of pogroms  . . . gathering  over our heads."" He expressed dismay that  ""as this incitement to murder takes place  before  the eyes of  all,""  the authorities  ""ignore the thugs and inciters.""  From President Mikhail Gorbachev not a  single word has come-no  repudiation of  Pamyat or of omni-present Jew-baiting. Last  year, when Mr. Kanovich,  joined by  two  members of the Academy of Sciences, Vitaly  Ginzburg and Oleg Gazenko, submitted to  the presidium of the Congress of People's  Deputies a petition calling for a condemnation of anti-Semitism, and for creating a  special committee to follow up on the issue,  the petition was buried.

173,1116,1,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to express my very strong  opposition  to  legislation which  the  Senate Judiciary Committee has ap proved, S.  438, which would make  major changes to the Racketeer Influ enced and Corrupt Organizations Act,  commonly known as RICO. The ap proach taken in this bill-severely lim iting the remedies available to victims  of consumer  fraud and white-collar  crime-is the wrong way to go about  reforming RICO.  Mr. President, there is little doubt  that we are currently facing an epidemic of white-collar crime  in  this  country.  The  General  Accounting  Office  [GAOl has  identified white collar crime as a major cause of insol vency in the savings and loan industry.  In 26  thrift institutions in one state  examined by GAO, fraud and other  abuses were uncovered  in each one.  The commodities  industry has been  the target of one of the largest FBI  sting operations in history, uncovering  evidence of massive fraud and insider  trading. Wall Street has been awash in  insider trading, stock fraud, and other  criminal activities, and the Pentagon is  still reeling from the recent procure ment fraud scandals. According to tes timony presented by the National As sociation of Insurance Commissioners,  over 160  insurance companies world wide are presently in some form of liq uidation/rehabilitation and insurance  fraud is an element in almost every in stance of failure of an insurance com pany.  The Congressional Research Service  has advised Congress in recent years  that defense procurement fraud costs  between $23  to $38 billion annually,  that bank fraud is the cause or a con tributing cause in at least half of all  bank  failures, and  that health care  fraud costs the Government $3.6 bil lion annually-roughly 5 percent of  the Government outlays in this area.  Overall,  it  is  estimated  that white  collar fraud costs Americans over $200  billion annually.  Any reform of RICO has to be meas ured against this backdrop of burgeon ing white-collar crime. This is not a  time when we should be limiting the  use of civil RICO proceedings brought  by  the victims of stock swindles or  consumer fraud. The National Associa tion of Attorneys General, from the  front lines of the battle against white collar  crime,  have  strongly  argued  against taking this step.  In testifying against the key provi sions of S. 438 which would weaken  the civil RICO procedures now avail able to private plaintiffs, the Nation's  attorneys general argued that Gover ment resources are simply inadequate  to cope with the depth of white-collar  crime ravaging the country's market places. These chief State law enforce ment officers stated that we cannot  begin to control the fraud that threat ens us without the kind of public/pri vate alliance that current RICO civil  remedies offer.  I strongly agree. We should be work ing  to strengthen, not weaken,  the  remedies  that allow  the victims of  white-collar crime to fight for compen sation for their losses.  LITTLE EVIDENCE OF NEED FOR SWEEPING RICO  REFORMS  Mr. President, the proponents of S.  438 have repeatedly claimed that civil  RICO reform is necessary because the  courts are being inundated with RICO  litigation and  the RICO  remedy  is  being misused as a weapon to force de fendants in ordinary business disputes  into unjust settlements.  The facts simply do not support that  contention. According to the testimo ny of the National Association of At torneys General, Federal civil RICO  filings declined 12 percent in 1987-88  and have never amounted to over one half of 1 percent of Federal civil cases  filed.  Moreover, courts have not hesitated  to curtail abuse of the civil RICO suits  through motions to dismiss or summa ry  judgments-procedures  which  result in meritless cases being swiftly  tossed out of court. In fact, 24 of the  34 abusive civil RICO suits most fre quently cited by the proponents of S.  438 were,  in  fact,  dismissed before  trial. These cases involve such exam ples  as  a RICO  suit between  two  rabbis, a divorce case, and a lawsuit by  a  journalist  against ABC-TV. The  courts  quite  properly  threw  these  cases out.  The problem with S. 438  is that it  addresses the problem of abusive liti gation by denying  legitimate victims  an effective remedy. A far preferable  approach to RICO reform would be to  provide  for  expedited  dismissal  of  cases which have no merit rather than  stripping  the  law  of  its  force  to  remedy all claims, regardless of merit.  Increasing sanctions for filing of frivo lous complaints  is another approach  which would focus on the abusive use  of RICO, rather than eliminating or  curtailing a  legitimate victim's reme dies and access to the courts. An addi tional tool is also available under rule  11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce dure which  provides  for  sanctions  against attorneys who engage in frivo lous litigation.  In fact, as the National Association  of Attorneys General has pointed out,  civil RICO already has a powerful bar  against abuse: every successful RICO  claim must establish, under current  law, that criminal conduct, indeed, a  pattern of criminal conduct, exists. A  run-of-the-mill contract dispute does  not normally involve the elements of  criminal fraud. Alternatively, as  the  Attorneys General have suggested, if  the definition of fraud under RICO is  considered to be too broad, then we  ought to focus on that narrow prob lem, not the wholesale restructuring  of the civil RICO penalties proposed  ins. 438.  LIMITING CIVIL RICO REMEDIES  Mr. President, there are a number of  changes proposed in S. 438 which I be lieve would be  to  the detriment of  many individuals injured by activities  now covered by RICO. The most seri ous problem is the elimination of the  automatic  triple damages now avail able to all successful RICO plaintiffs.  This  detrebling  of  damages would  mean that the civil RICO remedy, as  ",1990

181,1155,1,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, in  almost quiet passing, we pause to cele brate-if indeed that is what we do  here-the bicentennial of our highest  court; what its first clerk mistakenly  recorded, from force of habit, as the  ""Supreme Judicial Court of the United  States begun and held at New York on  the first Monday of February, and on  the  first day of  said month Anno  Domini 1790."" And, thereupon, being  no  quorum  established,  adjourned  ""until to Morrow, at one o'clock.""  So begun, on the second day of Feb ruary, on the second floor of the New  York Merchants' Exchange-which  had been designed and for some time  continued to be used as an open-air  market-the  first  term of  the  first  decade of the Court's judicial proceed ings. Vested by article III of the Con stitution its ""Judges-originally six both  of  the  supreme  and  inferior  Courts, shall hold their offices during  good Behaviour, and shall, at stated  Times,  receive  for  their Services,  a  Compensation, which shall not be di minished during their Continuance in  Office.""  Good ""behaviour"" was sorely tested.  The Court was directed to meet twice  in every year; the first term commenc ing in the cold of February and the  second  in  the  insufferable heat of  August.  The  Judiciary Act of 1789  estab lished 13 district courts in three cir cuits-the eastern, middle, and south ern with the exclusion of Maine and  Kentucky-and within each district of  the three circuits  two circuit courts  were established each  requiring  the  presence of ""any two Justices of the  Supreme Court, and the district judge  of such districts.     *"" Riding the cir cuit was harsh going for the Justices  and became cause for discontent.  The Nation was young and much  had been sacrificed, not  least being  the health and good countenance of  those early jurists who had helped to  establish the Union. In his letter dated  March  to Richard Law United States judge for the District of  Connecticut-John  Jay-then Chief  Justice-wrote of such concerns:  1790,  10,  SIR  ... For accommodations I presume there  can be no Difficulty in any Towns in which  the Courts are to be held in New England. I  wish to lodge in a clean orderly Inn, for as  to the Manner in which the Table may be  served, it is among the least and last of my  Cares.  I  thank you Sir! very Sincerely for your  kind Attention, and an with great Esteem  Your most ob.t & h'ble Serv.t  JOHN JAY.  Our roots in the subject of law and  an  organized  judicature  are  deep  indeed-in Rome and Byzantium-and  lest we forget them, we have found in  the  reflection of our own  jurispru dence those earlier jurists Cicero and  Justinian.  Indeed,  the English  jurist  Sir William Blackstone found ""that a  competent knowledge of the laws of  that society in which we live       an  highly useful, I had almost said essen tial, part of liberal and polite educa tion."" Yet the neglect of this subject is  apparent in the neglect of that branch  of our Government which Hamilton  suggested could not be complete with out, a judicary. ""Laws are a dead letter  without courts to expound and define  their  true meaning  and  operation.       To produce uniformity in these  determinations, they ought to be sub mitted, in the last resort, to one su preme tribunal.""  Despite the grandiosity of this herit age and of these appeals, the laws of  this new Republic were to be ""submit ted,"" in fact, on the second floor of a  butchers market. And following New  York City, moved to Philadelphia in  1791 to quarters unfinished. In the ab sence of any chambers, the Court met  temporarily for its February term in  Independence Hall-then State Hall in rooms left unheated owing to the  State Assembly's refusal  to provide  the Court with  stoves which  they  themselves enjoyed. By  the August  term of that year, the Court took its  rooms in the newly completed city hall  but was forced to share them with the  mayor's court.  The Court then moved from Phila delphia  to  the new Capital City of  Washington in 1801. Little changed in  the way the Court was treated by Con gress.  Indeed,  it was not until 1810  that it received rooms specifically de signed for it by the building's architect  Benjamim Latrobe. Even in these im proved  conditions  the  Court  was  forced  to share its space with other  lesser  judicial  courts  including  the  U.S. circuit court and  the orphans'  court of the District of Columbia.  These  questionable  improvements  were  short  lived. The British,  of  course, burned the Capitol in 1814. A  local tavern not far away took to the  business of providing accommodations  for the Supreme Court of the United  States until  its return  to what was  then characterized a ""dunjeon"" in the  Capitol Building in 1817. There is re mained,  changing  twice,  until  the  Court moved again in 1935, after great  effort at the behest of Chief Justice  William Howard Taft,  to Cass Gil bert's temple directly across from the  east portico of the Capitol Building.  And now we are  to have another  building. In some manner an apology  for a century and a half of neglect. A  . moment worth recording. On October  7, 1988, President Reagan signed into  law a bill <P.L. 100-480), the Judiciary  Building Development Act, which  I  was proud to have sponsored, author izing  the  construction of  a  second  building for  the Supreme Court. In  the long history of this Republic, in  the two centuries of the Senate, this  was only the second time we had been  asked to provide the Supreme Court a  building. The new building will be  built on land to the east of Union Sta tion designated for this purpose in the  1981 master plan for the U.S. Capitol.  The building is to be of monumental  quality-not size-as befits the dignity  of the Court. It was complement the  tableau of Union Station and the city  post office building both designed by  Daniel Burnham. And  it was have  heat.  I would hesitate to think we would  or could any longer neglect the impor tance of that branch of our Govern ment-the judicial-which has for two  centuries now preserved and protected  the Constitution of the United States.

186,1155,1,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, I  rise to join my colleague, the Senator  from Colorado, who earlier responded  to the statement by the President of  the United States this morning on the  question of global warming. According  to  reports  I  have  seen, which are  sketchy, about the President's speech  today on global warming, it appears he  cautioned all of us, scientists included,  against trying to solve the problem of  global warming by moving too quickly  or by burdening anyone, including any  of the major industries that are the  source of chemicals that most people  believe  are  causing  the  planet  to  warm.  That is a bit like telling a firefighter  to put out a fire without using water.  The truth is, all of us, individuals and  industries, are going to have to accept  some burdens if we are to protect our  endangered planet.

187,1168,1,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President,  recycling,  alternate  el).ergy  sources,  off-shore drilling, and global warming  are all issues certain to be echoing in  the Halls of Congress well  into  the  next century. As our constituents turn  to us for guidance, we must be pre pared to provide leadership as well as  adequate answers to their questions.  One such answer lies in our Nation's  youth. It we can develop a nation of  energy-literate students we  are one  step closer to a citizenry of informed  adults.  I  rise  today,  along with  a  number of my colleagues, to assist in  this energy education effert by intro ducing a joint resolution to designate  March 23,  1990 as National Energy  Education Day.  Congress  launched NEED  in 1980.  Since then, the project has grown to  include 38 State committees and over  150 regional committees. This year be tween 8,000 and 10,000 schools are ex pected to culminate weeks and months  of prior planning and research  in a  celebration of NEED's 10th anniversa ry. Based on the theory that students  retain more knowledge when actively  engaged, NEED incorporates coopera tive  learning and  the most current  educational research into a year-round  study of energy  topics.  In addition,  students use NEED as a vehicle  to  heighten their community's awareness  of many complex energy issues.  I urge may colleagues to cosponsor  this joint resolution, not as simply an other commemorative day but as an  opportunity to allow students, educa tors and community  leaders  to cele brate  the national  energy network  that the National Energy Education  Development Project has become.e  By Mr. CHAFEE  (for himself,  Mr. BAUCUS, Mr. BRADLEY, and  Mr. WILSON):  S.J. Res. 250. Joint resolution desig nating April 1990 as ""National Recy cling Month"";  to  the Committee on  the Judiciary.  NATIONAL RECYCLING MONTH  ",1990
188,1168,1,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, today  I along with Senators BAUCUS, BRAD LEY, and WILSON, are introducing legis lation to designate April, 1990 as ""Na tional Recycling Month."" The impor tance of educating the public about  the real benefits to society from recy cling cannot be overstated.  Recycling is not a new phenomenon,  at least not in concept. America's early  settlers recycled as a matter of surviv-al, turning corn husks into mattresses  and old clothes into quilts. Many of  my colleagues will remember the ma terials  conservation  efforts  during  World War  II, when aluminum  foil  was carefully saved, used automobile  tires collected, and many other con sumer  items were  recycled and put  If  toward the war effort. In fact, most of  us have  recycled materials at some  point in our lives-typically paper, alu minum, or glass.  While many of us may be familiar  with recycling, there is still a need for  public education campaigns to inform  consumers that garbage does not dis appear when  the sanitation worker  loads  it into  the  truck. Our society  must be made aware that there are  very real costs, both financial and en vironmental, associated with the con tinued prolif era ti on of municipal gar bage.  In the United States today we are  facing a crisis in solid waste manage ment. The United States presently is  generating about 160 million tons of  solid waste per year, almost double the  amount we  produced  in  1965.  present  trends continue,  the United  States will generate close to 200 mil lion tons per year by the turn of the  century. Towns and cities across the  United States are realizing that the  city dump will be forced to close its  gates in a few short years. Just in the  last two decades the number of land fills accepting solid waste has been re duced dramatically-from about 30,000  to 6,000. It is becoming virtually im possible to establish any new landfill  sites because of the ""not in my back yard syndrome,"" and the rising value  of land and real estate.  When confronting an urgent crisis,  such as the threat to human health  and the environment from burgeoning  mountains of trash, it is tempting to  look to technology to provide us with  the easy solution. Such technological  fixes, however, will not eliminate the  undeniable  need .  for  significant  changes  in the way we conduct our  daily  lives. Not only must we  find  more environmentally sound ways of  handling municipal trash, but we must  also greatly reduce the amount of gar bage we generate  in the first place.  This will require a concerted effort on  the part of consumers, manufacturers,  and government. That is why we are  introducing  legislation  to  designate  April,  1990  as National Recycling  Month.  Reducing the amount of household  garbage we generate poses the most  difficult of public policy  problems:  changing human habits. The purpose  of  this  legislation  is  to encourage a  public attitude that can allow  these  needed changes to take place. People  must be made aware that their actions  do have a critical impact on reducing  the amount of garbage entering the  waste stream.  It is critical that our Nation's chil dren-the next generation of consum ers-learn sound waste disposal prac tices so that by adulthood, those prac tices will have become habit. We se lected April  as National Recycling  Month so as  to coincide with Earth  Day, April 22, 1990. It is our hope that  during the month of April, schools will  sponsor educational activities on how  recycling can help us preserve  the  Earth's natural resources.  My home State of Rhode Island, for  example, was the first State to pass a  mandatory  recycling  law. Presently,  over 65 percent of the cities and towns  in Rhode Island separate recyclables  such as glass, paper, aluminum and  plastics for curbside collection. By Oc tober of this year, the entire State will  participate in this recycling program.  Recycling also creates employment.  According to one recent study 10,000  tons of material spawns 36  jobs com pared  to 6  for  landfilling  the same  amount.  Some  communities  have  formed working  partnerships with  workshops for the disabled, developed  and administered job training partner ships, or otherwise found work for un employed labor in recycling programs.  In my own State, the Rhode Island  Department of Environmental Man agement estimates that 300 jobs have  been created by recycling.  The exciting feature of the battle  against solid waste is  that it can be  won. Other nations  are  doing  far  better than we are. No drastic solu tions are required, nor are big sacrific es  sought. With  relatively  small  changes in habits, educational initia tives, and reasonable laws we can over come the crisis we now face. I urge my  colleagues  to  help  us move  closer  toward this goal by joining us in desig nating April, 1990 as National Recy cling Month. I ask unanimous consent  that the full text of the joint resolu tion be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the joint  resolution was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S.J. RES. 250  Whereas  the  continued  generation  of  enormous volumes of solid waste each year  presents unacceptable  threats  to human  health and the environment;  Whereas several  regions of  the United  States are experiencing a severe shortage of  disposal capacity for municipal solid waste;  Whereas as a result of the inability to find  sites for new solid waste management facili ties, many communities are managing waste  in facilities that were not designed with the  best available environmental controls;  Whereas  the  generation  of  hazardous  waste and solid waste must be reduced and  as much remaining waste as possible must  be recycled to protect human health and  the environment and to minimize treatment  and disposal capacity problems;  Whereas a  significant amount of waste  can be diverted from disposal by the utiliza tion of source separation, mechanical sepa ration, and community-based recycling pro grams;  Whereas local governments should be an  integral component of the decisionmaking  process  regarding  the management  of  municipal solid waste;  Whereas developing a  system of waste  management  that,  to  the greatest extent  practicable, separates elements of the waste  stream that require special management or  ",1990
189,1181,1,Mr.  CONTE.," Mr.  Speaker,  one  Member  after another got up  last  week to bash the President's budget.  The noted budget philosopher and  social critic Mr. Russo let us know in  his immortal words that it ""stinks and  lies."" The powerful chairman of the  House Budget Committee said Presi dent Bush is ""playing games with the  budget."" A thoughtful Member from  Kansas  told us  that  the President  wanted to kill Tiny Tim.  The critics say this budget's spend ing priorities are wrong. They say it's  full of smoke and mirrors. And they  say if they were in charge, that would  all change. We'd get us the cleanest,  tightest,  deficit  reducingest  budget  we've ever seen.  Well, last fall they were in charge.  And what did we get? Last November's  reconciliation bill-a scandalous meas ure  full  of  sham  savings,  special  favors, one-time revenues and mystery  amendments nobody ever saw or ex amined. Moving agriculture deficiency  payments  from  fiscal  year 1990  to  fiscal year 1989. Delaying Medicare  payments for 2 days to claim a half  billion dollar savings. Shifting the post  office  off-budget,  for  $1.7  billion.  Those clouds of  smoke and  jagged  chunks of mirror made up a quarter of  the savings.  That was the best part of it.  The worst was sequestration. And  the Budget Committee-the home of  the  loudest  bashers  of  this  year's  budget-stood by and let  it happen.  Committees  that  failed or even  re fused to meet their savings targets like Merchant Marine and Fisheries  with the Coast Guard user fee-got off  scot free, and committees which met  their targets got hit with a sequester.  Maternal and child health care,  re search on cancer, student aid-they all  got hit. That bill was a shame and a  scandal on the whole Congress.  Now, this year's budget isn't perfect.  No one expects it to be perfect-it's  the first step in a year-long process.  We all have an interest, and we all  want to change it in our own way.  That's fine. But nobody's going to  get anything done by standing here at tacking the President of the United  States and pretending the Ways and  Means Committee or the Budget Com mittee is as pure as driven snow.  Let's cut the nonsense, get off the  soapbox and get to work.  MAKING SENSE OF NON-PROFIT  AND VOLUNTEER LIABILITY  <Mr. PORTER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1990
190,1181,1,Mr.  PORTER.," Mr.  Speaker,  213  Members of  this body have cospon sored H.R. 911 the Volunteer Protec tion Act, a bill I introduced to protect  the 110 million Americans who freely  give their time in our local communi ties.  H.R. 911 encourages the States to  enact  statutes protecting  individual  volunteers from personal financial li ability in a tort suit against the orga nization they serve. As appalling as it  may seem, the fact is that volunteers  are named in suits against the organi zations they serve, and studies show  that many Americans don't volunteer  because  they  are  afraid  of  being  dragged into court.  The Volunteer Protection Act takes  a sensible approach to this problem.  First, it doesn't protect volunteers who  intentionally  or  maliciously  cause  harm. Second, it doesn't prevent an in jured party from suing the organiza tion for redress of his or her griev ances. What it does do is prevent the  use of legal gymnastics to harass vol unteers.  Mr. Speaker, the bill makes so much  sense that dozens of States have al ready enacted similar  laws. We can  support this movement and America's  volunteers by  taking action now on  the Volunteer Protection Act.

192,1194,1,Mr. SKELTON., I yield to the gentle man from Mississippi.  ,1990
193,1194,1,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker,  the gentleman is right. We did learn  from Grenada, and I hope that we will  take what took place in Panama and  use it to improve further future oper ations, which we hope we will never  have again.  However, talking to our troops who  participated down  there,  the airmen  and especially the Army type, active  duty types, as well as some National  Guardsmen and Reservists,  they are  volunteers. I used to be very strong in  that I  thought that we needed the  draft, and go back to selective service;  but these were volunteers. They knew  what they were getting into.  I guess what I am saying is, the all volunteer service, as far as I am con cerned is working well.  ",1990
194,1194,1,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker,  if  I  may interrupt, and this point is a good  reason, at least for  the  last several  years, for our military attracting such  outstanding young men and women. It  is due to the bill that is named after  the gentleman from Mississippi,  the  Montgomery GI bill.  It is no small  thing. I have been in Kansas City, and  also with the gentleman on one occa sion  at  the  Baltimore  Recruiting  Center. We walked in and asked the  young men  that we  encountered,  ""Why are you  joining  the service?""  They were multiservice  candidates.  ""Why  are  you  joining?"" And  any  number of them said, ""Because I want  a college education, based upon the GI  bill.""  ",1990
195,1194,1,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker,  if the gentleman will continue to yield,  the gentleman is certainly part of the  history of the GI bill, in that it bogged  down several years ago. We could not  get it out of committees. The gentle man offered a compromise on the GI  bill for peacetime personnel, and it did  move forward. I appreciate what the  gentleman did as far as that peacetime  GI bill.  They are good soldiers, and I would  hope now that we would use National  Guardsmen and Reservists to take the  place of active duty people down  in  Panama,  so  to  the gentleman  from  Missouri,  in such as military police  and such as engineers to go down on  15-day training, and I think it would  be excellent for them as well as learn ing their jobs.  SKELTON. Mr.  Speaker,  I  happen to agree with the gentleman  from Mississippi, and I mention in my  formal presentation here my concern  that there is still a gulf, a gap between  the active duty and the Reserve forces  in our country. I think this is serious,  and I am not sure what we can do  about it, but to get them to act in con cert more should be one of our job  goals. They have done it. They have  some reservists down there now, par ticularly in the civil affairs operations,  Mr.  but I think we can do a better job of  causing them to work hand in glove to gether.  I see, and had a briefing the other  day by the Marine Corps reservists,  telling me how they integrate to some  extent their active duty senior non commissioned officers,  and some of  their officers into the Marine Reserve.  I  think  the gentleman and  I  have,  from where we stand in the Subcom mittee  on Military  Personnel  and  Compensation of the House Commit tee on Armed Services, we may want  to explore this and use the Marine ex ample for the other services. I  think  this is at least worth a serious discus sion.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the bal ance of my time.  D 1340  TRIBUTE TO THE TREATY OF  WAITANGI  The SPEAKER pro  tempore <Mr.  BENNETT). Under a previous order of  the House, the gentleman from Ameri can Samoa [Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA] is rec ognized for 60 minutes.  ",1990
196,1194,1,Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA.," Mr. Speak er, I appreciate the Chair's approval of  this special order, and for this occa sion it is most fitting and certainly a  personal honor for me that I take this  opportunity  to  share with my  col leagues in the House of Representa tives a most historical event that is  now  celebrated  today  in New Zea land-the signing of  the Treaty of  Waitangi 150 years ago between some  500 Polynesian Maori chiefs on behalf  of 115,000 Maoris and certain British  officials who represented some 2,000  European settlers who  lived  in New  Zealand at that time.  Mr. Speaker, it is of interest to note  that for some 1,000 years before 1840  the country that was and still is re f erred  to  today by  the Polynesian  Maoris as ""Aotearoa"" was discovered  by  Polynesian  settlers  who  were  among  the well-noted  seven canoes  coming from  the  legendary  land of  Hawaiki from whence the migrations  had their origin. These early Polyne sian voyagers described the newly dis covered land as the ""Land of the Long  White Cloud.'' Hence, the name, Ao tearoa.  According to Maori tradition, their  homeland, Hawaiki, was  an  island  north of Aotearoa and was inhabited  by their forefathers before the great  wars. The first Polynesian Maori who  discovered  Aotearoa  was  a  chief  named  Ngahue.  He  returned  to  Hawaiki and told the people of the  new land he discovered, where he ate  the moa bird and  the fems. After wards, seven great Polynesian voyag ing canoes were built in Hawaiki, and  thus we saw the beginning of settle ments by these early Polynesian voy agers. To this day, the Maoris trace  their genealogies and ancestry to the  original seven canoes, which are still  known today as the Arawa, the Tainui,  the Matatua, the Takitumu, the Kura hauop, the Tokomaru, and the Mata whaorua.  I say these things, Mr. Speaker, be cause my own district, the Territory of  American Samoa, and its inhabitants  are culturally and ethnically related to  their Polynesian Maori cousins who  now  live  in New Zealand alongside  their Pakeha or Europeans who now  make New Zealand  their permanent  home.  It is important to note that the com memoration  of  the  signing  of  the  Treaty of Waitangi 150 years ago gives  us all a better appreciation of how two  different nationalities with differences  in  culture,  language,  history,  and  origin can live  together in harmony  and with common understanding.  Mr. Speaker, I want to share with  my colleagues an historical account of  how this important treaty became a  reality.  I  appreciate  the  narrative  issued by the Ministry of Maori Af fairs, by my good friend, the Minister  of Maori Affairs, Mr. Koro Wetere,  from which I will draw in sharing the  history of this important document.  Mr. Speaker, I also want to express  my appreciation to my friend, the Am bassador from New Zealand who pres ently serves here in the United States,  Mr. Tim Francis.  What was New Zealand like before  1840? It was essentially a Maori coun try. The Maori population was esti mated at about 115,000  throughout  the country. Scattered about the coast  were European settlers, estimated at  about 2,000 by the year 1840, but there  was also a large transient population  of whalers and traders who periodical ly-visited the country.  It was a country that was increasing ly being affected by contact with the  outside world,  not  just by  people  coming into the country but also by  Maori going out. The Maori were great  travelers. Many had reached England.  As a result, some Maori people spoke  English and had seen what was hap pening in the New World. They saw a  very strong British Empire and a Brit ain that ruled the waves and which  had defeated Napoleon's France. So  they looked to Britain as the major  maritime power of the period.  Maori and Europeans in New Zea land had by this stage established an  understanding and a relationship with  each other based on trade and mutual  interests. This growing  relationship  and a desire for a more harmonious  country set the scene for the treaty.  It was not until 1840 that New Zea land was established as a colony under  the British Crown. Such official Brit ish involvement came about because it  was requested both by settlers and by  the Maori people.  ",1990

The American-Soviet Youth Orches tra is composed of college musicians  from around the United States under  the sponsorship of the Conservatory  of Music at Oberlin College in Ohio,  and Soviet musicians from the Moscow  Conservatory  of Music.  The  First  Lady, Barbara Bush, is the American  honorary chairman of the orchestra.  This resolution is needed since the  orchestra will be using the stage and  tent used by the national symphony  for their summer concerts on the Cap itol Grounds, and structures may not  be erected on the grounds without this  type of a waiver.  Mr. Speaker, this should be an en joyable concert for the public, and I  believe  that  this program will help  young people of the United States and  the  Soviet  Union  recognize  the  common bonds they share. I urge my  colleagues to support passage of House  Concurrent Resolution 198.  ",1990
206,1233,1,Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT.,"  Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to express my  support  for  this  resolution which  would authorize a performance by the  American-Soviet Youth Orchestra on  the Capitol Grounds  I  understand  that Barbara Bush  serves  as  the American  honorary  chairperson of  the orchestra, with  Raisa Gorbachev serving as the Soviet  honorary chairperson.  This orchestra, composed of talented  young American and Soviet musicians,  will perform in both the United States  and the Soviet Union. Sponsored by  the Conservatory of Music at Oberlin  College and the Moscow Conservatory  of Music,  this performing  arts  ex change  program  includes  cultural  training and the opportunity to stay in  homes of families  in the host coun tries. I am sure it will be a valuable  learning  experience  for  the  young  people involved.  This resolution will authorize a con cert on the Capitol Grounds on either  August 28 or August 29, 1990. The or chestra will use the facilities that will  be  in place  for  the annual national  symphony Labor Day concert. No Fed eral funds are involved and additional  expenses, if any, would be the respon sibility of  the orchestra sponsors. A  similar resolution was passed by the  Senate last year.

208,1233,1,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  first  would like to thank Chairman ANDER SON  for his expeditious handling of  this bill. Plans are afoot to allow the  American-Soviet Youth Orchestra to  perform on the Capitol Grounds. A lot  of preliminary work, preparatory work  has to be undertaken. It is very impor tant that we get  this permission as  soon as possible.  Chairman ANDERSON has been very,  very helpful in moving this bill for ward.  As has been said by other speakers,  the American-Soviet Youth Orchestra  is sponsored by the Conservatory of  Music at Oberlin College, which is in  my district, and by the Moscow Con servatory of Music and the Soviet Min istry of Culture.  Its mission is  to help young musi cians and  their  audiences  to  learn  from each other and to live together  in  the same spirit of harmony that  their music engenders.  First Lady Barbara Bush  is  the  American honorary chairperson of the  orchestra,  as  you have heard,  and  Raisa Gorbachev  is  the  honorary  Soviet chairperson.  Mr. Speaker, this is the second year  that the finest young musicians from  both the United States and the Soviet  Union will be selected for the orches tra, which will make concert tours in  both countries.  This year in the United States, for  example, they will be playing here in  Washington and in my hometown of  Oberlin, also at Epcot Center and at  the Hollywood Bowl.  In many communities where  they  perform, the musicians join with the  local educational and other  institu tions to give chamber ensembles and  master classes.  The effort is intended to reach and  influence  a  grass-roots  constituency  and  to  familiarize  people  through  music with language, the customs and  political systems of another country.  D 1330  The orchestra does need the permis sion of Congress to perform on the left  lawn.  This  concurrent  resolution  simply provides that permission, and  does not have funding as an objective.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to  thank the gentleman from California  [Mr. ANDERSON] and his committee for  their expeditious  treatment of  this  resolution. I  just want to say that I  think  this  is a  small but important  step toward increasing understanding  between  the United States and  the  Soviet Union. As we all know, there  ",1990
209,1246,1,Mr. THOMAS  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself 6 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, let me rise in support  of a piece of legislation which is less  than its critics have claimed it to be,  and, frankly, more than some of its  supporters believe it to be. It is a piece  of legislation which, although compre hensive at the Federal level, provides a  significant amount of individual deci sionmaking for States and areas where  clearly  the States should have  that  kind of individual decisionmaking.  I, too, as my colleagues, the gentle man from Washington CMr. SWIFT],  the chairman of  the subcommittee,  with whom I have enjoyed a long and  mostly positive working relationship,  feel compelled primarily to talk about  what this bill is not, since most of the  criticisms of the bill are in fact criti cisms which the bill does not deserve.  For-example, I would urge all my col leagues to be very, very careful about  material that has been disseminated in  terms of cost. There  is  in fact one  piece of  information  from  a  study  group which says that the cost of H.R.  2190  to  the Federal Government  is  $200 million. If we would examine the  documents, I think we would find that  the actual amount is $200,000.  Now, we are often accused of drop ping zeroes in spending money in various areas, but I would hope that when  we report on this bill, we would under stand that it is not a $200 million cost  but a $200,000 cost.  During debate on the rule there was  an accusation that the bill is virtually  useless because of its vagueness, for  example, in section 106. There is no  specificity  in  terms of  the kinds of  criminal  convictions  under  which  someone would be denied the right to  vote. There was a discussion about the  fact that if they meant a felony, they  should have said, ""a felony,"" and if  they meant  a misdemeanor,  they  should have said, ""a misdemeanor.""  They said this bill is too vague to be of  any use, ""and look at all the mandat ing that is required.""  I would urge my colleagues to read  the entire section in dealing with the  information on death, criminal convic tion, or mental incapacity, because it  is stated over and over again in the  bill, after that kind of vital statistic in formation is transmitted to the official  voter registration list for adjustment,  it is under State law. The decision as  to which criminal conviction removes  someone from the voting list is to be  determined under State  law. What  kind of mental incapacity is to be de termined as to what removes someone  from the voter list is to be determined  under State law.  If someone wants to argue that we  are vague in that area, I guess they  can argue on a specificity basis that we  are vague. We do not have the Federal  Government dicatating what specific  criminal convictions are going to keep  someone  from  or  remove  someone  from the voter list. We had no inten tion of doing that. We had no inten tion of involving ourselves in an area  where the State ought to make that  decision, and in fact the bill says that  the States should make that decision.  We also had some of our colleagues  upset by the fact that in their particu lar States fishing and hunting licenses  are sold at 7-Eleven's and other kinds  of convenience outlets, and that all of  a sudden the Federal Government is  mandating that the local 7-Eleven reg ister voters. I would entertain some one's examination of the bill and the  terminology that was used in an at tempt to get government agencies to  involve themselves in the voter regis tration area, requiring absolute neu trality under Federal penalty of law,  in a neutral way offering the opportu nity to register people, not in private  enterprise areas, but for example, as  the bill says, in ""fishing and hunting  bureaus,"" agencies of the government.  Now, we have an outreach program  for the private sector to be involved if  they so wish. In California we have  been able  to  involve fast food  fran chises and outlets  in a  number of  other areas in offering an opportunity  to  register people  to vote.  I  think,  given today's lifestyle of people, it is  not  inappropriate  that  the Govern ment try to be as outreaching and for ward-looking as possible, including the  private sector, in extending people an  opportunity to register.  Mr. Chairman,  another complaint  levied against the bill is that it is sup posed to increase voter turnout, and  some say, ""We really don't think it is  supposed to increase voter turnout or  we don't think it will."" I will ask them  to turn to the purposes of the Act. No.  1, it says, ""to increase registration of  citizens as voters."" It is not that the  registered voters are necessarily going  to turn out.  I say to my colleagues that I think  we have a vast amount of work to do  in the area of an honest and fair ap portionment, in the area of campaign  finance, and in putting back into the  picture local people so they can feel as  though they have a chance to influ ence an election. All of those are items  that would affect turnout.  What  this bill  intends  to do and  indeed does is to get people in a con venient way registered and, more im portantly,  in an orderly fashion,  re moved from the rolls so that what we  have are accurate rolls. I think a rea sonable program to get people to vote  is to, first of all, have an accurate roll  from which  one  can make  those  choices, not one which is exceedingly  difficult to get on or impossible to get  off, but one which is reasonable and  orderly in putting people on and rea sonable and orderly in removing them.

211,1246,1,Mr. MFUME.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman from Washington CMr.  SWIFT] for yielding time to me, and I  rise  in very  strong support of  the  measure before us today.  Mr. Chairman, I join my colleagues in strong  support of this momentous and historic piece  of legislation, H.R. 2190, the Voter Registra tion Act of 1989. This bill will make voter reg istration more accessible  to  the . millions of  Americans who, for a number of reasons, do  not have the means to register.  Five years ago we celebrated the 20th anni versary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to  mark the significant progress we have made  in allowing our citizenry  the opportunity  to  vote. With the passage of the 1965 act, many  blatant and  sinister obstacles administered  through  the  repressive Jim Crow  laws were  dismantled. Yet, today many Americans-par ticularly minorities and  low-income persons are still locked out of the electoral process as  other impediments prevent full participation in  the electoral process on election day.  Mr. Chairman, the United States has one of  the worst voter turnout records among indus trialized nations.  In  the Presidential election  year of 1984, only 53.1 percent of the voting  age went to the ballot box, and in 1986 only  37.1 percent. And only 50.8 percent of the  population voted in the last Presidential elec",1990
212,1259,1,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support  of H.R. 2190, the National Voter Registration  Act, which seeks to remove existing barriers  to voter registration, and encourage eligible in dividuals to register to vote.  In the 1988 Presidential election, voter turn out was only 50 percent of  the U.S. voting  age population. The United States consistently  has the lowest voter participation rates among  the Western democratic nations. Even in de veloping nations, such as Namibia, where the  people had to walk for miles, and stand in line  for hours under the broiling sun, to vote in a  free  election,  voter participation  rates  are  higher than the United States. The participa tion rate in the recent election in Namibia was  over 90 percent.  Today, 60 million Americans are not regis tered to vote. As democracy spreads across  the world,  throughout Eastern Europe, and  indeed, even into the Soviet Union, we must  make every effort to remove barriers to par ticipation  in our great democracy.  If we are  intent on  remaining  the shining beacon of  freedom and democracy that has inspired mil lions of immigrants to come to  this  land  for  over 200 years, then we must open the voting  booth to every American.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2190 will encourage  voter  registration by making  the  registration  process as easy and quick as possible, while  ensuring the  integrity of the voting rolls and  the election process. H.R. 2190 will mandate  mail-in  registration, and  registration at many  Federal and State offices, such as public  li braries,  public assistance offices,  city and  county clerks' offices,  and  public  schools.  H.R. 2190 also provides for a process known  as motor-voter registration, which would allow  citizens to register to vote when applying for  or renewing their driver's license.  Each of the registration methods called for  in  the bill  is a proven method of increasing  registration  in a efficient and cost-effective  manner. Linking voting registration with appli cation for a driver's license would reach about  90 percent of the voting age population.  This bill will not  increase voter  fraud, as  some opponents have claimed. Many of these  opponents used this same argument 25 years  ago, in the debate over the Voting Rights Act,  which  eliminated  discriminatory  registration  practices, and extended  the right to vote to  many black Americans  for  the  first  time.  In  fact, several features of the bill would actually  decrease the likelihood of voter fraud, includ ing  the  requirement  that  the voting  lists be  verified periodically.  In addition,  the bill  in cludes penalties  for people who  fraudulently  register.  In short, Mr. Chairman,  this will make  tre mendous progress  toward  increasing voting  registration and  voter participation.  It  is a  measure which is long overdue.  ",1990
213,1259,1,Mr. BRENNAN.," Mr. Chairman,  I urge my  colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 2190,  the National Voter Registration Act.  This  measure,  in expanding opportunities for eligi ble  individuals  to  vote,  eliminates barriers  individuals  which now stand between many  and the voting polls.  The  right  to vote  in a Federal election  is  guaranteed  in  the Constitution. By putting  Federal and State Government in  the active  position of encouraging individuals to register  to vote, we further enhance that constitutional  right.  In  the past Presidential election,  studies  found  that only 50 percent of eligible voters  chose to cast a ballot. While I recognize that  many citizens freely choose not to vote, we  must ensure all available efforts are made to  lessen barriers which deter voting. This is not  a Democrat  or Republican  issue-but an  American issue. The values we hold so impor tant can only be secured through the electoral  process. This  legislation helps  to promote  greater voter participation-a goal we should  all share.  In my own State of Maine, we have proven,  through our policy of same-day  registration,  that citizens who  register are citizens who  vote. By linking voter registration with driver's  license application, over 90 percent of those  eligible to vote would be given ample opportu nity to do so. Alternately, mail registration and  on-site registration would give nondrivers the  opportunity to register and vote.  The National Association of Secretaries of  State, who oversee  the processes of voter  registration  in  their  respective States, have  endorsed this legislation as one that is work able.  I enclose  for  the  record a letter from  Maine's secretary of state, G. William Dia mond, in support of H.R. 2190.  I urge my colleagues to join me in support  of this legislation.  STATE OF MAINE,  OFFICE OF SECRETARY OF STATE,  Augusta, ME, January 29, 1990.  Hon. JosEPH E. BRENNAN,  Longworth House Office Building, Washing ton, DC.  DEAR JoE: I have been informed that the  Universal Voter Registration Act  <H.R.  2190) will be up for a vote on either Tuesday  or Wednesday of this week.  I believe this legislation to be long over due and would hope that you might consid er supporting it.  In sum, I find it a very positive initiative  which will not only assist  the disinfran chised  and  unregistered  in Maine,  but  Maine's numerous  elections' officials  as  well.  Thank you for your consideration-please  call if you have any questions.  Sincerely,  G. WILLIAM DIAMOND,  Secretary of State.  ",1990
214,1259,1,Mrs. MEYERS of Kansas.," Mr. Chairman,  rise to express my strong support for efforts  to increase voter registration and voter partici pation in the United States.  Any democracy has as  its  foundation an  active, well-informed electorate.  It should be  the goal of the States and the Federal Gov ernment to encourage registration and partici pation.  This is why I will vote for H.R. 2190, the Na tional Voter Registration Act. But while  I will  vote for the bill, and while  I strongly support  voter outreach efforts, I do have reservations  about four of the bill's provisions.  The section of the bill of primary concern to  me would  require States to designate State  offices and agencies as voter registration lo cations. Included in the bill's list of these reg istration  locations are State offices selling  hunting and fishing licenses.  In some parts of Kansas, hunting and fish ing licenses are sold at bars and bait shops.  While proponents of the bill say that States  would have discretion  in designating  these  registration points, opponents say that the bill  language would not allow State discretion.  I believe this section of the bill should be  clarified to ensure that the States can desig nate the State agencies and offices they con sider necessary and appropriate voter regis tration locations.  I would also prefer that the motor-voter pro visions of the bill would not automatically reg ister those who apply for a driver's license.  A better system, in my view, would attach a  separate voter registration application  to the  driver's license application. An individual wish ing  to  register  to vote could  then sign  the  voter application and be registered.  Whatever the procedure,  I believe that an  individual should demonstrate some small in dication of interest to show that the right to  vote means enough to him  that he will  take  action on his own.  I am also concerned  that  this bill prohibit  States from retaining some previously enacted  antifraud laws, including requiring notarization  of signatures.  Voter fraud is not a problem in Kansas, but  it certainly has been in other States. And the  individual States know best how  to prevent  the particular kind of fraud in their areas.  And  finally, Mr. Chairman,  I want  to relay  the concerns of my secretary of state, who  wonders how he will pay for the extra book keeping and computerizing this bill would re quire.  The State of Kansas will have to spend ap proximately $1.3 million to comply with the bill.  It  is unlikely  that  the $50 million  in Federal  funds authorized by the bill will cover the cost  to  the States-cost incurred complying with  Federal mandates.  So while I believe this bill is a good one, I  also believe it can be improved greatly in the  Senate  or  in House-Senate  conference.  I  hope the final version of the bill provide the  States with the flexibility they need to adminis ter the Federal election laws.  The CHAIRMAN.

219,1272,1,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, I think  the House may want to look carefully  at this motion to recommit, because it  really does speak to the question a lot  of Members  have  about  this  bill.  Namely, the possibility of fraud. This  particular motion  to  recommit  sug gests that we ought to tighten up the  fraud provisions in the bill  in three  specific ways: No. 1, we ought to have  better mail verification, which would  permit State officials to require verifi cation of information on mail registra tion forms; second, under this particular motion, what we would  do  is  remove the middleman, assuring that  nonelection officials, middlemen, so to  speak, would not be processing voter  applications; third, under this bill, we  have the election crimes that would  actually be specified. It adds specific  fraudulent activities to the list of Fed eral voting crimes of bribery,  filing  false election information, and postal  fraud. These are all things that if they  were adopted, we think would tighten  up the ability of this bill to have voter  registration without potential fraud.  ",1990

221,1272,1,Mr. THOMAS of California.," Mr.  Speaker, as most Members know, I am  in support of the bill, and I was op posed to the en bloc amendments.  As Members examine the specific in structions under the motion to recom mit, I think Members will find there  are six specific instructions under the  motion  to  recommit. Two of  them  have to do with specifics that are con tained in the bill itself. The four that  come under  the enforcement provi sion,  before Members  stand  up,  I  would say and argue that this is some thing similar to the en bloc amend ments if they are basically going to  gut the bill. I would caution Members  that  the  four  specific  instructions  under the motion to recommit on en forcement were contained in S. 1711, a  bill which passed the U.S. Senate on  October 5, 1989, 100 to 0.  I have attempted to try to maintain  a bipartisan position on this side. The  Senate, in a bipartisan acceptance of  the enforcement provisions in a bill on  the Senate  side,  S.  1711,  believed  unanimously that these were reasona ble enforcement provisions.  ",1990
222,1272,1,Mr.  GILLMOR.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would make  just one point. We all  want to encourage everyone to vote,  but we want to be sure by the purpose  of this motion that that vote  is not  canceled by someone else's fraud.

This  proclamation  brings  to  the  awareness of Montanans of not only  the constitution in the State of Mon tana  but  the Constitution  of  the  United States of America. It is one of  those sacred rights that has kept this  society  and  this Nation  strong  for  some 200 years plus.  As we go down through history and  we recognize what is going on in the  world around us, we  recognize  that  these rights are sacred and should be  upheld at all times, those constitution al rights and the recognition of the  Governor of Montana, I applaud him  for his actions in this proclamation.  I yield the floor.  THE CLEAN AIR ACT  ",1990
225,1298,1,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, I am very  pleased the Senate has begun debate  on the reauthorization of the Clean  Air Act. I applaud the President for  making it a top priority and I applaud  him also for his initiative to increase  substantially the planting of trees in  this Nation which can have an important impact and a favorable impact on  the quality of our air and of our envi ronment.  Mr. President, I represent a beauti ful State. We want to protect it and  preserve it for our children and their  children. Missourians want clean air  and I share that goal and I am here to  work for it.  The bill before us is S. 1630, report ed in December by the Senate Envi ronment and Public Works Commit tee. It regulates a tremendous variety  of air emissions with complex regula tory schemes and ambitious deadlines.  It would toughen current laws regulat ing auto tailpipe emissions and pollu tion in highly urban areas. It would es tablish new regulatory programs for  the control of sulfur dioxide emissions  from utility plants <acid rain) and haz ardous air emissions from manuf actur ing facilities. S. 1630 would also regu late emissions from municipal inciner ators. Finally,  it would  require  the  phaseout of the production and use of  all chlorofluorocarbons.  Mr. President, while I am strongly  supportive of clean air legislation, I  have some concerns about this specific  bill which I would like to outline.  My first concern is  title IV, which  creates a new and far-reaching acid  rain control program. This issue has  been debated for a long, long time. We  need to get it behind us and Missouri  is willing to do its fair share.  I would like to note however that we  are acting on the problem before we  receive a final report of the National  Acid  Precipitation Assessment  Pro gram. The report is due in September.  It seems unfortunate and a little bit  strange to me that after we spent $400  ",1990
226,1324,1,Mr. DODD.," I am delighted to clarify  this  issue for my friend  from Ken tucky. Let me assure you that it was  never the intent of the committee that  this  provision would  affect  home school teachers, or their regulation by  the States, in any way. As a matter of  fact, section 1010 of the bill explicitly  provides  that  ""Nothing  in  the bill  shall be construed  to  infringe upon  the rights and responsibilities of the  States to license elementary and sec ondary teachers.""  The provision before us concerns the  purely voluntary advanced certifica tion of experienced  teachers, and it  has nothing to do with State licensing  and regulation of home-school teach ers,  or  of private  school  teachers.  Moreover, with respect to the issue of  voluntariness, it was clearly the com mittee's intent to make this certifica tion voluntary, just as is the case with  board certification of doctors. I hope  this addresses the Senator's concerns.  ",1990
227,1324,1,Mr. FORD., I thank my friend from  Connecticut for his statement. I think  this clarifies the fact that this legisla tion will not infringe upon the rights  of States to permit and  to regulate  home-school and private school teach ing.  NATIONAL LITERACY ACT  ,1990

231,1324,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Chair recognizes Senator BOREN.  ,1990
232,1324,1,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, I  first  compliment my colleague from Con necticut for the remarks he just made.  I  associate myself with his  remarks  both about the merits of the bill and  also about  the particular merits of  title X which he explained in great  detail and great accuracy and clarity.  Mr. President, I am often asked as  chairman of the Intelligence Commit tee to name the greatest threat to the  national  security  interests  of  the  United States.  For many, many years I think that a  person in my position when answering  that question would have talked about  the nature of the Soviet threat, would  have talked about the missile threat  aimed  against  this  country, would  have  talked about the power of the  Warsaw Pact to launch a conventional  attack across the borders of Western  Europe and Eastern Europe. We would  have thought of our national security  interest in terms of ability to garner  intelligence  in  terms of balance of  military forces.  Mr. President, with all the changes  that are taking place in the world, in cluding the incredible debate that is  now taking place in Moscow, even as  we meet today, in terms of a restruc turing of the Communist Party of the  Soviet Union, the changes that have  occurred in Eastern Europe, seeing the  virtual  elimination  of  the Warsaw  Pact as a military force to be reckoned  with, if I were to be asked that ques tion today, I would answer it very dif ferently  than  those who were my  predecessors would have answered it 5  or 10 years ago.  I would have to say that the greatest  threat to the national security of the  United States  is  represented  in our  failure to fully develop the human re sources of  this country. We under stand that the Soviet Union has been  a  in  the military  sense. It is not an economic superpow er. It is certainly not a superpower in  terms of the appeal of its philosophy  to the rest of the world. What we have  sometimes failed to understand is that  there has been an ironic and symbolic  relationship between  the power and  influence of the United States in the  world and the power and influence of  the Soviet Union.  Now that the military threat from  the Soviet Union is perceived as rapid ly declining by the other nations of  the world, we have  to  realize  that  those nations will no longer automati cally be so anxious to follow the lead  of  the United States  in matters of  international importance. The NATO  countries were willing  to follow our  lead  because  they were  concerned  about the Soviet threat and the threat  from  the Warsaw Pact  and  they  wanted the protection offered by the  shield of American military strength.  In  the Orient,  the Japanese were  perfectly content to spend only about  one-seventh the proportion of military  expenditures as we were spending in  this  country but  they wanted  the  shield of American military protec tion. And they were willing to follow  our lead  in international matters of  ~uperpower only  great importance because they wanted  to continue to benefit from that Amer ican military protection against what  they perceived as the threat from the  Soviet Union and  the Eastern bloc.  Now that they are no longer so con cerned about  that  threat,  they are  going to be much less willing to follow  the lead of the United States in world  affairs.  How  then will  the United States  reassert its role in the world? What  kind of role, Mr. President, will we  play in world affairs in the 21st centu ry? The 20th century in many ways  has been the American century. It has  been American ideas and ideals that  moved the world to change. It was a  symbol of this country, the Statue of  Liberty, that was raised in Tiananmen  Square that moved the world to sup port student demands for change in  that country. It was American  ideas  and ideals used by Lech Walesa, when  he began his speech to us at the joint  session of Congress, with  the words  ""We, the people."" That further moved  the world to support change in East ern Europe.  But what of our role in the next cen tury? In the next century, the influ ence of this country will have to be ex erted in different ways,  in terms of  moral  influence  of  our  ideas  and  ideals;  it will have  to be exerted in  terms of hopefully major exchange  programs between our students and  students of other nations so that we  can teach the next generation of lead ers in other nations of the world about  our system of government, our form of  society,  our  sense  of  fairness  and  human dignity. But it also will rest  upon the ability of the United States  to protect economic growth.  Mr. President, we are in a far differ ent situation than we were in 1950, for  example, when we still had great mili tary strength, indeed almost a monop oly on military strength in the world,  and we  led the world in a way that  perhaps no other nation has ever led it  in history. At that time we had the 10  largest banks in the world. Today, we  do not have any of the top 20 banks in  the world. At that time, we had a 68percent share of the world's assets and  almost  a  70-percent  share  of  the  world's markets. Today, our share of  the value of world assets is about 20  percent and our share of world mar kets is about the same.  So if we are going into a totally new  world environment in which the influ ence of this country is no longer going  to be founded upon and based upon  our military strength but upon our  economic  strength  and  our moral  strength, what  then must we do  to  equip ourselves for this world that we  are going to be living in in the 21st  century,  for example,  if we have a  dropout rate in this country of 29 per cent of all of our 18-year-olds who do  ",1990
233,1337,1,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I rise in  strong support of S. 169, the National  Global Change Research Act of 1989. I  am pleased to have worked with Sena tor HOLLINGS on the development of  this very  important  legislation  that  will  enhance our knowledge of  the  greenhouse effect and ozone depletion  by requiring a  long-term coordinated  research effort.  Scientific uncertainty on global cli mate  issues has  led  to an  intense  debate and has hampered efforts  to  set policy. Researchers agree that con centrations  of  carbon  dioxide  and  other greenhouse gases in the atmos phere raise the temperatures of the  Earth and that the concentrations of  these gases are increasing from burn ing fossil fuels. But scientific predic tions of the magnitude of the tempera ture rise range from 3 or 4 degrees  Fahrenheit to as much as 9 degrees.  And the timeline varies from already  occurring to the middle of the next  century.  Despite some uncertainties, there is  overwhelming consensus  that global  warming  is  a  serious problem  and  action to address this cannot wait. The  potentially alarming consequences, in cluding droughts,  flooding,  and sea  level  rise, as well as  the associated  health risks, cannot possibly be trans lated into a research-only attitude for  responsible scientists and policymak ers. The U.N. Environmental Program  and the World Meteorological Organi zation have already organized repre sentatives  of  30  countries  into  an  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change CIPCCl  to develop a strategy  on global climate change.  Here  in  the United States, nearly  half of the National Academy of Sci ences joined with 49 Nobel laureates  to urge President Bush  to  take  the  threat of global climate change seri ously and to begin to take action. In  addition,  the President's own policy  advisers have suggested a greater need  for  action. Unfortunately, President  Bush once again fell short of his cam paign promises and  failed  to  show  leadership in his address to the IPCC  yesterday where he committed only to  study  the problem and not  to  take  action. This is reminiscent of the past  decade when the Reagan administra tion refused to acknowledge that the  country was suffering from acid rain  and  insisted on study versus action.  Will we have to wait for another 10  years of administration-backed studies  before we see any real progress on this  devastating problem?  The Clean Air Act will  give  the  Senate an opportunity to show some  real  leadership by  taking actions  to  curb greenhouse gases.  I hope  that  yesterday's speech by  the President  does not undermine the Senate's ef forts to keep these strong provisions in  the clean air bill  that  is currently  pending before Congress.  There  is a greater consensus  that  chlorofluorocarbons  CCFC'sl  and  other manmade chemicals destroy the  Earth's stratospheric ozone layer. This  ozone  layer shields  the Earth from  harmful radiation. Not only has this  effect been substantiated, but it has  been measured. While it was once be lieved that ozone destruction was con fined to areas over Antarctica, we now  know that this is a problem over popu lated regions of the Earth, leading to  increased incidences of cancer. About  50 nations have now signed the 1987  Montreal Protocol that sets  interna tional targets for reducing these com pounds. I am pleased that the Senate  clean air bill goes beyond the Montre al Protocol in phasing out ozone-de stroying chemicals.  One of science's greatest challenges  will be to provide the information nec essary  to develop sound policies on  global change. The  task  is difficult,  but as a member of the Senate Global  Environmental Task Force and  the  Senate Commerce Committee,  I  am  committed to seeing that the United  States leads the way. This very impor tant piece  of  legislation moves  us  closer to scientifically sound policies  by setting national priorities and es tablishing national goals  for global  change research.  ",1990

252,1363,1,Mr. COCHRAN.,"  This  amendment  incorporates  the  thrust of my legislation-the Student  Athlete Right-to-Know Act-as report ed by the Senate Labor and Human  Resources Committee.  Mr. President, we  have all heard  about both the highlights and pitfalls  of participating in intercollegiate ath letics. Many high school and college  athletes dream of playing for a Divi sion I team and, perhaps, of a profes sional sports career. Yet only 1 out of  every 100 high school athletes will re ceive a scholarship to play at a Divi sion I college. Most of those lucky few  can expect a pressure-packed environ ment where academics and athletics  collide in a world with heavy demands  and  little  time. And even  fewer of  those who do play in this high pres sure league will ever make it to the  pros. In 1986, 12,000 men played col lege basketball, but only  161 were  drafted by the NBA. Of the 161 who  were drafted, only a few will play more  than 3 or 4 years.  Single-minded devotion to athletics  among our Nation's schools and colleges  can  lead  to  exploitation  and  abuse  of  the  student  athlete. The  result can be a  sad story. Too  fre quently the student athlete, failing his  or her courses or not carrying a full  course load, exhausts eligibility, loses  an athletic scholarship, and drops out  of school-with no education, no train ing, and only a few memories for com fort. A  recent General Accounting  Office report indicated that the grad uation rate of basketball and football  student athletes who attend division I  schools is very poor. It is my under standing that at one division I institu tion, the graduation rate was a pathet ic 7 percent for students on basketball  scholarships  during  the  decade  of  1972-83.  Mr.  President,  that  should  not  happen. With the proper balance be tween academics and athletics, sports  can provide the means to an education  that might otherwise be unattainable.  Many athletes have applied the disci pline of the arena  to  the classroom  and have gone on to satisfying careers.  We need more success stories built on  good habits and opportunities seized.  That is why I  introduced the Stu dent Athlete Right-to-Know Act  in  the Senate. This is a consumer inf or mation bill for student athletes and  their families. Student athletes about  to enter college should be consumers  of  education  and  participants  in  sports, if our priorities are in order. As  such, they are entitled to the relevant  and basic consumer information that  is an essential element of an informed  choice. The choice of which college or  university to attend is likely to be one  of the most important decisions of a  young person's life. A potential stu dent athlete and his or her family are  entitled to a direct an valid answer to  the question, ""If I enter your college  or university as a freshman on an ath eltic scholarship in my sport, what are  the  chances  that  I  will  graduate  within a year of those in my entering  class?""  This amendment  requires  colleges  and universities to report graduation  rates,  including the graduation rates  of student athletes broken down by  sport, race, and sex and the proportion  of students who earn a degree within 5  years, reported by sport, ra.ce, and sex.  The information is to be made avail able to high school student athletes,  their families, and high school guid ance counselors and principals, to aid  the student athletes as  they choose  the schools they will attend.  Mr. President, since the legislation  was reported by the Labor Committee,  the NCAA  in January-in a  nearly  unanimous  vote-adopted  require ments consistent with this legislation.

I  thank them for their  courtesy.  This amendment is a follow-on to an  amendment which  I offered  to  the  body last year and which was adopted  into law providing for random, volun tary drug testing of student athletes in  secondary schools.  Mr. President,  the Senate adopted  that  language  last year and  it was  signed into law by the President late  in the year.  This  particular  amendment is  a  follow-on to that, as I said, because it  establishes a supplemental grant pro gram of $5 million to be used over 3  years allocated to States on the basis  of school enrollment. The rest of the  language  is the same as that in the  previous  amendment which  passed  this body.  Mccutcheon High School in Indiana  embarked upon a random drug testing  program more than a year ago because  it discovered a serious problem with its  student athletes and the use of drugs.  The  Tippecanoe  County  School  Corp.  adopted  the program  for  its  schools.  It has been  tested  in  the  courts. The seventh district court has  upheld the program unanimously and  testing began in the fall of 1989. At  the time it is important to note that  since that time, there have been no,  and I repeat no, failures at either of  the two high schools which have insti tuted this drug testing program. That  consists of approximately 500  tests,  and we are excited about these results  because it is a program that works. It  ",1990
263,1415,1,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, I  deeply  regret  the violence  that has  racked Lebanon since civil war broke  out in 1976.

I  have been particularly haunted by  photographs of children who have lost  limbs, homes, and families. That is the  human  tragedy that lies behind the  statistics of war.  In response to this violence, I am in troducing  the Lebanese Temporary  Protected Status Act. This bill would  allow Lebanese students and visitors in  the United States to remain here until  the  fighting dies down  in Lebanon.  During this time, Lebanese would be  allowed  to  support  themselves  through work. Our Lebanese friends  would return  to  their country after  the Attorney General determines that  it is safe to do so.  I also encourage the Commissioner  of the Immigration and Naturalization  Service to give special consideration to  those many Lebanese in Lebanon who  are applying for refugee status. I real ize  that  these positions are  limited,  but Lebanese are in a particularly per ilous situation.  Mr. President, the hour is late, but  not too late. In the modest way pro posed by this bill we can at least limit  some of the casualties of this sad con flict. At some point, peace will return  to Lebanon. We all hope for that day.

A bill to provide law enforce ment authority for criminal investiga tors of Offices of Inspectors General,  and for other purposes; to the Com mittee on Governmental Affairs.  OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL LAW  ENFORCEMENT ACT  e ",1990
264,1415,1,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President,  today  I  am  introducing  legislation  along with Senators DECONCINI and  COATS which,  if enacted, will benefit  the law enforcement community and  save  the  taxpayers' money. My bill  will provide full law enforcement au thority to all criminal investigators in  the Offices  of  Inspector General  COIGJ. Full law enforcement authority  includes making arrests,  issuing  search warrants and carrying firearms.  I currently serve, Mr. President, as a  Commissioner on the National Adviso ry Commission on Law Enforcement,  as do Senator DECONCINI and Senator  COATS. The Commission was  estab lished by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of  1988 to study pay, benefits, and other  issues related to the recruitment, re tention, and morale of Federal law en forcement officers. One of the recom mendations of the Commission is re lated to the belief that it is difficult to  recruit and retain criminal investiga tors for the OIG's because they lack  full law enforcement authority.  By law, the statutory OIG's are all  charged with  responsibility  for con ducting investigations of programs and  operations in their agencies. Although  the statutory law enforcement respon sibilities of all OIG's are  identical,  they do not have uniform authorities  to exercise  law enforcement powers.  At present, the OIG's employ approxi mately  1,900  criminal  investigators  CGS-181l'sl. Fewer than half of these  special agents exercise some  limited  form of enforcement powers through  existing or delegated authority.  Like ""traditional"" law enforcement  agencies  [FBI, DEA,  IRS, Customs,  Secret Service-whose criminal investi gators  are  also GS-181l'sl,  special  agents of the statutory OIG's investi gate fraud, public corruption and re lated offenses. Like the traditional law  enforcement  agencies,  they  conduct  their investigations through review of  records,  use  of  informants,  surveil lance,  undercover  operations,  ap proved  electronic  monitoring  and  interviews with hostile witnesses and  subjects. These investigative subjects  and witnesses are often  involved  in  narcotics sales, illegal weapons trans actions and other activities commonly  associated with violent crimes such as  assault and battery, unlawful use of a  weapon, rape, murder, resisting arrest  and extortion.  Unless employees of traditional law  enforcement agencies, Mr. President,  OIG special agents must  frequently  enter high-crime areas to gather inf or mation or serve subpoenas without the  protection of firearms. Frequently, in formants or witnesses who cooperate  with the Government require protec tion, or an investigator must monitor a  meeting between an informant and a  subject.  Sometimes suspects attempt to flee,  known  fugitives are encountered or  subjects admit  to crimes during an  interview, and OIG agents are unable  to arrest them or take other immedi ate action to detain them. More often,  cases were unreasonably delayed or  agents placed  themselves at risk by  acting in the absence of full law en forcement authority.  ",1990
265,1467,1,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, to date, over 71  Members of the House have sponsored H.R.  3880, the Medicare Benefit Improvements Act  of 1990.  The bill would provide new mammography,  hospice, home health, and respite care bene fits to the Medicare program.  The bill is endorsed by the National Alliance  of Breast Cancer Organizations. Following  is  their letter which helps explain the importance  of this legislation:  JANUARY 18, 1990.  Hon. FORTNEY P. STARK,  Chairman, Subcommittee on Health, Wash ington, DC.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN STARK: We have been  informed that you and Congressmen Gradi son and Waxman plan  to  introduce The  Medicare Benefit Improvements Act of 1990  1465  in the second session of the lOlst Congress,  legislation that would provide Medicare re imbursement for screening mammography.  The National Alliance of Brea.st Cancer Or ganizations and our 180 member organiza tions across the country wish to extend our  congratulations, and our support.  As you know, breast cancer has reached  epidemic proportions in the United States,  striking one out of  ten women. It is  the  most  common  form  of  cancer  among  women, and until 1986, it was the leading  cause of death from cancer in women. In  1989, there were an estimated 143,000 new  cases of breast cancer. La.st year, approxi mately 43,000 American women died from  the disease, the majority of them over 55  years of age. The premature death of a  women from cancer is always tragic. Yet the  greatest tragedy of all is that many of these  deaths could have been prevented  if  the  cancer has been detected earlier.  We have the technology to detest breast  cancer when  it  is  still  in  its very early  stages. Mammography is a highly safe and  reliable procedure which can detect tumors  before they can be felt-when the chances  of cure are over 90%. Yet very few women  undergo regular mammography screening,  and currently, many insurance policies do  not cover  the cost of mammography for  screening purposes.  For more than a decade, scientists have  known that diagnosing and treating a breast  malignancy when  it  is preclinical <micro scopic) and non-palpable <too small to be  felt) will save the lives of thousands of our  female citizens. A randomized screening pro gram conducted by the Health Insurance  Plan of New York in the 1960s proved that  the 10-year death rates of women older than  50 who were  diagnosed  to  have  breast  cancer after being examined by mammogra phy and a clinical examination, were more  than 30% lower than those of women who  were examined but not mammographed. In  November 1987, these life-saving benefits of  mammography  were  described  Dr.  Myron Moscowitz, director of a screening  center in Cincinnati, at a hearing before the  House Subcommittee  on Health  of  the  Ways and Means Committee.  If these life-saving benefits of mammogra phy have already been proven, why are  about 50% of new patients diagnosed after  the cancer has already spread? This ques tion was answered by several polls conduct ed by the American Cancer Society and the  American College of Radiology. Most doc tors are reluctant to order mammography  because of its cost <as high as $200), while  radiologists-the  specialists who  interpret  mammograms-argue that dedicated equip ment, the salaries of trained and certified  technologists, supplies and overhead are the  same, whether they do one mammographic  examination each day or 50. It is a proverbi al vicious circle: women are not being re f erred  for mammography because of  its  high cost; the reason the examination is so  expensive is that too few women are being  screened.  Cost containment is the argument which  can defeat proposed mandatory coverage for  breast  screening,  even  though  this  is  a  penny-wise and pound-foolish policy: it costs  many more taxpayers' dollars to treat ad vanced breast cancer than it does to detect  the  disease  by mammography  screening  before it has spread. Of course, no dollar  value can be put on the pain, suffering and  premature death that inevitably follow a di agnosis of advanced breast cancer. It is im perative,  therefore, that all insurers cover  by  ",1990

No one has been a more forceful, articu late, and loyal advocate for Central Valley ag riculture than Dick Markarian.  Dick knows farming from the ground up. He  has been a fearless champion of farm issues  and causes as divergent as labor, water, pes ticides,  land use, and marketing orders. He  has counseled politicians and elected officials  at all  levels. All who know and have worked  with Dick  have  enormous  respect  for his  energy and commitment.  To me, Dick has been a supporter, a coun selor, a critic, and a friend. He can always be  counted on for an objective opinion. His only  bias is to do what's right for agriculture. You  can agree or disagree with Dick Markarian but you can't ignore him.  It is appropriate, and frankly over due, that  our community pay tribute to the contributions  Dick has made. The Ag One Scholarship En. dowment Fund is a fitting way to honor Dick  Markarian, and I am proud to play a small role  in helping to honor this outstanding agribusi nessman, friend, and community leader.

268,12,7,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, our col league, Senator BOREN, recently wrote  an article, published in the Washing ton Post,  arguing  that  a  changed  world calls for a new vision of the  United States role in it.  Senator BOREN argues that as the  perceived  Soviet  threat  declines,  America's allies around the world will  feel that they do not need U.S. protec tion any longer. In addition, with an  increase in their own prosperity. they  do not need us economically as much  as they once did. All of this adds up to  a declining willingness of our friends  and allies to follow the U.S. lead on  international issues.  In response to this challenge to the  U.S. position  in  the world, Senator  BOREN  concludes  that  the United  States cannot afford to rely on the  same foreign policy tools put in place  by  the Truman  administration  45  years ago. He proposes that we  link  foreign aid to the purchase of Ameri can products, that the staffing of U.S.  embassies  abroad  should  reflect  a  greater emphasis on promoting our  economic interests, and that the stu dent exchange program be greatly in creased.  These and other recommendations  by Senator BOREN make  eminently  good sense, and they deserve thought ful consideration by the President and  Congress.  I  ask unanimous consent  that the full text of Senator BoREN's  excellent article be printed at  this  point in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Washington Post, May 2, 19901    FoR A MODEL NATION  <By David L. Boren>  For the past four decades, America's allies  have been willing to follow this country's  lead largely because of the perceived threat  from the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc.  As long as there was a threat, they needed  the shield of American military protection,  especially when we were bearing so much of  the economic burden of paying for it.  But now that this threat is greatly re duced, many will feel that they do not need  our protection anymore. As a result, they  will be far less willing to follow our lead on  matters of international importance to us.  Nor do our allies need us economically the  way they did in the '50s, when we had nine  of the 10  largest banks in the world and  two-thirds of the world's assets and mar kets. We began the '90s with none of the top  20 banks and an asset share less than half  that of 40 years ago.  Does this mean that the United States,  which has led the world in the 20th century,  will be automatically reduced to a bit player  on the world stage in the 21st? It could  happen if we squander the opportunities we  have in this decade to reorder our priorities.  They must be seized quickly for they may  not come again.  A different set of assets will be needed for  a leadership role in the next century. Eco nomic strength along with the moral force  of America's political and social example as  a model for others will be more important.  While we must  remain prepared  to deal  with a variety of military threats, overall  military strength will be less important.  Those who doubt that economic competi tion is more and more replacing military  competition should examine what is hap pening in the intelligence field. An increas ing share of the espionage directed against  the United States comes from spying by for eign governments against private American  companies aimed at stealing commercial se crets to gain a national economic advantage.  There is no time to waste. We need to re align our foreign policy to advance our na tional economic interests. What should we  do?  First, change the way we give foreign aid  by giving more in the form of credits to be  used solely to buy American products pro duced with American  Jobs. Recent polls  show opposition to foreign aid running at 80  percent. They are a clear indication that the  United States will not be able politically to  reach out to newly emerging democracies  unless we develop a way for American tax payers to see a return for their tax dollars  in terms of more Jobs at home.  West Germany and Japan are following  this policy. Over 90 percent of their recent  aid  to Poland and Hungary came in the  form of restricted credits. From 1984  to  1987, aid in the form of such credits given  by other nations increased from $4 billion to  $12 billion. Our failure  to have a  ""Buy  American Plan"" has cost Americans billions  of dollars in lost exports in the past five  years alone.  'we must remember that burden sharing  in helping other nations also means influ ence sharing and a diminished role for the  United States economically and politically  in the future. A Buy American Plan would  enable us  to expand our  influence, help  others and help ourselves at the same time.  Second, change the perspective of Ameri can embassies and missions to give greater  emphasis to supporting our economic inter ests. We must recruit more people into the  Foreign Service and  intelligence agencies  with economic skills and  training. Right  now,  two-thirds of our embassies do not  even have a commercial officer in the em bassy to assist our businesses. When we do  have a commercial officer, it is three times  as likely that the official is a foreign nation al.  Embassies must be regarded as outposts to  further our economic  interests. We must  put behind us the attitude that commercial  sections of diplomatic missions  are nui sances best relegated to basements or an nexes. If we don't restore our economic in fluence we will soon be without political in fluence.  Third, dramatically increase student ex change programs for college undergradu ates-especially with the Soviet Union, East ern Europe and Latin America. Such a pro gram serves our interests in two ways. It  forges bonds with the future generation of  leaders of nations of growing importance to  us. It also helps sensitize our students to the  need to become more international in their  training and outlook. Doubling the size of  the Peace Corps would be another impor tant step in the right direction.  We can't compete if we can't speak the  world's languages and don't understand the  world's cultures. Our educational system is  woefully  insular. One hundred percent of  Japanese high school graduates have stud ied at least six years of English, while a tiny    ",1990

273,25,7,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I do not  quarrel with my distinguished  col league about the fact that the 3,000  rules have been reduced  in volume.  But  then we  run  into all kinds of  things when we get into that reduc tion as to what will be interpreted in a  simple fashion.  The  distinguished  Senator  from  Delaware indicated that there are, I  believe he said, 13 permitted and 16  prohibited activities that those 3,000  have been whittled down to. But you  still come down to such things to how  you make the judgments in specific  cases.  It has been held to be OK, for in stance, to wear a campaign button on  the job. That is permitted. It does not  say anything about  that in  the  in structions here, but that is one of the  things under questioning they say you  can do. You can wear a  campaign  button on the job, as I understand it.  Or more than that, you can write a  $1,000 check to a candidate. That is a  very  substantial  contribution,  the  maximum permitted under Federal  regulations.  What  if you  did not have  that  $1,000? What if you wanted to give an  in-kind contribution of your time? Say  you want to go down and stuff enve lopes, you are not going to be out on  TV or radio broadcasting for a specific  candidate. You want to go down and  help out-you are civic minded-and  do what you can do. Or, someone says,  would you like to circulate a nominat ing petition and see if you can get sig natures on this? That is legal. As I un derstand it, that is not covered in the  13 permitted and the 16 prohibited ex amples  that my  distinguished  col league points out.  Another example: You would think  if you were going to be able to use a  political post for whatever purposes,  that you could use  that post about  anywhere you wanted. If you .ao to a  rally. and the Senator is correct. you  are permitted under the rules to go rto  a political rally  just as a spectator,  that is spelled out. You can go as a  spectator. You better keep your hands  in your pockets because  if someone  hands you a sign to hold while they go  make a telephone call, you can be ar rested, I presume, or you could have  charges brought against you as violat ing the Hatch act.  In other words, the point being you  can go  to the political rally but you  cannot hold a poster. You cannot wave  a poster at a political rally, but at the  same  time you can  take  that same  poster you are prohibited from even  touching anywhere else and you can  put it on your car or you can take it  home and put it in your front yard.  But I believe-and I am not sure, I do  not have  the  figures on  this  right  here,  I believe  the figures are  that  there are certain size restrictions on  what you can put on your car and clif f erent size restrictions that apply to  your  front yard.  that something  that really should be the subject of  Federal law?  Here  is  another one.  If you  are  asked, you are absolutely permitted to  express your opinion about a candi date publicly, and that is spelled out publicly. But you are prohibited from  making  a  campaign  speech  for  or  against anyone. If I am ""Hatched,"" I  can go out and say here is what I beIs  ",1990
274,64,7,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, I ask  for passage of S. 1846, a bill making  technical corrections to certain Indian  laws. Since this bill was adopted by  the Select Committee on Indian Af fairs on November 14, 1989, several  new changes have needed to be made,  including deletion of  four  sections.  These changes are  included  in  the  committee amendments that I ask be  adopted as part of the bill.  Mr. President, during the lOOth Con gress, over 30 new statutes on Indian  matters were enacted into  law. The  mues were wide-ranging and some of  the legislation was quite extensive. As  with any new laws or extensive amend ments, technical errors such as incor rect references or citations occur. This  bill, S. 1846, corrects errors that appeared  in some  laws passed  in the  lOOth Congress and,  in some cases,  errors that occurred in earlier years  but that were only recently discovered.  Certain of the amendments in the bill  are simply intended to better fulfill or  clarify the intent of the Congress or to  facilitate  the administration of  the  law.  Besides technical corrections to the  Indian Reorganization Act  amend ments and the 1988 amendments to  the  Indian Self-Determination  and  Education Assistance Act, the bill also  amends the 1988 Indian Education Act  to provide that the executive director  and chairman of the National Adviso ry Council on Indian Education will  participate in the White House Con ference on Indian Education. S. 1846  also extends the grace period during  which certain tribes in the States of  Montana and Wisconsin may continue  to operate games as they seek to com plete  tribal/State agreements under  the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory  Act.  Other acts that are amended are the  act to establish a reservation for the  Grande Ronde Community of Oregon,  the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community  Amendment to the Lac Vieux Desert  Band Act, the White Earth Reserva tion Land Settlement Act, and  the  Hoopa-Yurok Settlement Act.  Finally, the bill provides authority  for an appropriation to the Secretary  of Health and Human Services for the  Administration for Native Americans  for the conduct of a feasibility study  by the George Washington University  for  the establishment of a National  Center for Native American Studies  and Policy Development. This national  center would serve as a school of gov ernment for tribal governmental lead ers, would establish a curriculum in  Indian law and Indian affairs, would  serve as center for the development of  Federal-Indian policy, and would pro vide a national data center and clear inghouse for historical and cultural in formation on native peoples.  The bill also contains a section that  clarifies  the status of  the probate  judges employed by the Interior De partment's Office of Hearings and Ap peals to preside over, hear, and resolve  heirship  claims  to  Indian  allotted  lands. Further, the provisions of this  section  clarify  the  availability  of  review of final decisions of the Office  of Hearings and Appeals in the Feder al courts, consistent with the provi sions of the Administrative Procedures  Act.  Lastly, the bill clarifies the author ity of the Secretary of the Interior to  implement, within existing Indian irri gation project power  revenues,  the  provisions of agreements between Fed eral, State and tribal governments to  ensure adequate supplies of water on  ",1990
275,77,7,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, our Na tion's political parties give us  ideas,  passion, and  the discipline  to make  tough choices-three items which our  political system desperately needs.  Our  parties  are  unifying  forces  which provide reliable, consistent, and  coherent  communication with  the  American voters. However, our parties  are losing the struggle for influence  because their hands are tied by contri bution limitations. Under the current  system, parties have no more ability to  make direct contributions to their own  nominees than special interest politi cal action committees.  Mr. Speaker, to strengthen our polit ical parties and ensure that more chal lengers can run competitive races, we  should remove all limits on political  parties' contributions  to candidates.  Of course, full disclosure and report ing to the Federal Election Commis sion must be required.  Let's take away the special interest  influence and give it back to our citi zen-based political parties, and there fore  to the American people, where  the power and accountability belong.  LOWER MERCED RIVER MAY BE  ADDED TO WILD AND SCENIC  RIVER ACT  CMr. CONDIT asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1990
276,77,7,Mr. CONDIT.," Mr. Speaker, 3 years  ago the lOOth Congress adopted legis lation that guaranteed Yosemite Valley's river, the Merced, would be pro tected for future generations to enjoy  by adding its main stem and beautiful  south  fork  to  the Wild and Scenic  Rivers System.  Today it is my pleasure to introduce  legislation that would extend this pro tection  to  the  lower portion of the  Merced River. This section was put in  as a study section by the lOOth Con gress so that the local county of Mari posa would have the opportunity to  develop a domestic water system com patible with the requirements of the  Wild and Scenic River Act. The legis lation I propose today would accom plish this goal.  This legislation is supported by the  Wilderness  Society,  the  Merced  Canyon  Committee,  the Mariposa  County Board of Supervisors and the  Mariposa County Water Agency.  The pristine quality of  the  lower  Merced River make it a worthy addi tion to the Wild and Scenic River Act  so that present and future generations  can enjoy and experience its beauty.

277,77,7,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am  introducing  the Sport Act  of  1990-a special program of recreation al training for youthful residents of  public housing developments.  Mr. Speaker,  this program  is de signed to turn the kids of public hous ing away  from drugs and  toward a  healthier and happier lifestyle.  The program I am proposing dedi cates 5 percent of public housing drug  elimination grants  to programs pro moting sports and cultural activities in  public housing.  The program, which would provide  grants to PHA's, voluntary organiza tions and local governments, would re place a similar program administered  by HUD prior to the HUD Reform Act  of 1989.  When Congress eliminated the Sec retary's discretionary  fund,  late at  night in the final hours of the last ses sion, it also eliminated the authority  under which Jack Kemp's ""bats and  balls"" program was previously operat ed. My bill would provide authority  and guidelines for a new program to  promote organized sports activities at  public housing developments.  Under the Sport Act, grants would  be awarded for an array of activities,  including acquisition of sports equip ment,  development  of  recreational  areas and operation of sports leagues.  I  invite my colleagues  to  join my  sports-minded  friends,  the  distin guished Mo UDALL and TOM MCMIL LEN, and myself in cosponsoring this  important legislation. Be a sport: co sponsor the Sport Act of 1990.  <",1990

279,77,7,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. Speaker, there  is even more bad news for the country  and  the American  taxpayer on  the  S&L bailout.  At the same time that the estimated  cost of the bailout is skyrocketing from a nightmarish $160 billion to an  unimaginable upper range of $500 bil lion-the President is planning to re place the one experienced manager we  have on the job. That would be a mis take.  William Seidman has been a voice of  integrity and intelligence in the cess pool of the S&L scandal.  Mr. Speaker, the country needs Mr.  Seidman  running FDIC more  than  ever. Without him, the costs are likely  to go even higher.  That  is why 23 members of  the  Banking Committee sent you a letter  yesterday, urging you to not let Mr.  Seidman leave.  Why should this country abandon  the service of one of the few credible  regulators who  have  experience  in  cleaning up the S&L mess?  When S&L time bombs are going off  all over the country we simply cannot  afford  the 6 months  to  train new  senior regulators, the people who must  defuse those time bombs.  It has been 9 months since the S&L  bailout was passed. In that time the  administration has ignored the prob lem as if it would go away if no one  paid attention.  I am deeply concerned that this ad ministration is blaming the messenger  for bad news. Getting rid of Mr. Seid man may temporarily cool the politi cal heat. But the fire will burn even  worse without him.

280,77,7,Mr. DELAY.," Mr. Speaker, the debate  over campaign reform has been  in creasing  and  the American  public  needs to know that the Republicans  are the voice of real campaign reform  in the House.  House Republicans endorsed a pro posal  for  serious  campaign  reform  more than 7 months ago. That propos al incorporates the provisions of a bill  I  introduced, H.R. 2589, the Workers  Political Rights Act.

283,90,7,Mr. BRYANT.," Madam Chairman, I  would like to first commend the gen tleman from New Jersey [Mr. RoE] for  his pioneering efforts in this area. I  believe history books will tell future  readers who was responsible for press ing forward in such an innovative area  that has caused such an enormous  contribution, which we  are on  the  verge of making today.  Madam Chairman,  the  supercon ducting super collider is the moon shot  of the 1990's. The fact of the matter is  it comes at a time when America's pre dominant role in the world scientific  community is threatened. What I am  speaking about is the fact that today  it is very appropriate we are taking up  the super collider issue, because the  front pages of newspapers all over  America read that the government of  Japan is targeting yet another Ameri can technology.  Today, the United States holds the  lead in the world in an advanced com puter technology known as massively  parallel processing, a software technol ogy that allow thousands of processors  to work together at high speeds.  D 1430  Now having achieved dominance in  supercomputing, the Japanese are now  announcing  that  they are  targeting  the United States in the area of paral lel processing. What does that have to  do with the SSC?  The fact of the matter is that the  project is one of the primary forces  driving progress in American parallel  processing efforts, and it will give us  vanguard  technology  in many other  areas as well.  I believe this will be the showcase  project of our Nation's science pro gram for the future, and it should be.  Building the collider will help preserve  America's technological lead, not only  in  the area of  the superconducting  super collider, but many others as  well.  Finally I want to make this point: A  superconducting super collider is going  to be built somewhere no matter what.  Two overseas accelerators with ca pacities greater  than America's cur rent largest, Fermilab, are currently in  the planning stages, one in the Soviet  Union and one in Switzerland. The su perconducting super collider would be  stronger  than  both,  if  built. But  should the Soviets or the Europeans  build  accelerators  and  the United  States decides not to build, the United  States will lose many of the world's  top scientists.  I  submit we have al ready received a great deal from the  super collider  research.  I  submit  it  would be false economy not to go for ward at this time and to keep our lead  in the area of scientific research in the  world.  ",1990
284,90,7,Mr. ARMEY.," Madam Chairman,  I want  to  take a few minutes to tell you why I strongly  support the SSC and will oppose attempts to  attach harmful amendments to H.R. 4380.  I  welcome  open  debate on  the SSC. This  project is eminently defensible and worthwhile.  In  fact  I would compare the SSC  to past  projects  in  its potential  to contribute  to the  betterment of our civilization and our under standing of the underlying principles of the  world which surrounds us. History books are  full of examples of similar excursions and ex plorations intended to expand the frontiers of  knowledge about our planet and beyond.  The Nation has a long tradition of support ing scientific research and exploration. For ex ample, President Jefferson sent Lewis and  Clark out West to explore the uncharted fron tier. The information they came back with pro vided the next generation of westward travel ers with a preview of  the conditions  they  would encounter, terrain, weather, and native  American tribes.  A more recent example is the Space Pro gram. President Eisenhower supported  the  creation of NASA to explore the wonders of  space. Each phase of NASA's existence has  built upon our knowledge and allowed our  country  to  lead  the way  into outer space.  Could our communications satellite systems  which benefit the entire Nation, and the world  for that matter, have been placed  into orbit  without the benefit of the scientific foundation  laid down by NASA in the 20 years between  1960 and 1980? The answer shouldn't sur prise anyone. Most of the innovative products  and services which we  take  for granted  in  1990 are  in some way beholden  to  the re search which was done 20 or 30 years ago  during the early days of our space effort.  The superconducting super collider  is es sential to the scientists of tomorrow and will  equip those scientists with the basic research  which will  provide  the United States  the  knowledge and the tools to continue our suc cess in so many fields well into the 21st cen tury. The dollars  this Nation,  the State of  Texas, and foreign contributors will  invest to  make the SSC a reality will help maintain our  leadership in high-energy physics and will lead  to advances  in communications, electronics,  computers, and countless other fields.  We have a responsibility to provide a firm  foundation  for the next generation of Ameri cans. The collider is an integral piece of that  foundation. More than that, we have a duty to  uphold our historical  tradition of leading the  way into the future through ambitious explora tion.  I am proud the collider will be built in Texas.  But the collider itself is more important than  where it will be built Individual scientists, uni versities, and  companies  from  around  the  country will participate  in building and using  the collider. This is truly a national project and  I am proud to support it.  Some have  raised questions about  this  project. A few Members have doubted Texas'  financial commitment. Let me  tell you  this,  Texas will provide every single dollar that is  ",1990

302,103,7,Mr. HALL of Texas.," Madam Chair man, I know  the gentleman  is very  aware of  the facility at CERN and  DESY where they brought the crys tals  from Russia,  they brought  the  magnets  from China,  and brought  them from all over the world. That is  an  international project. There was  not Just a point of the fact that it was  near  the Swiss-French border  that  they all got together and built that.  The whole world benefits. Should not  the whole world benefit in this? Clear ly,  the whole United States benefits  from it.  ",1990
303,103,7,Mr. RITTER., The gentleman makes  a good point. It is definitely an inter national project. I was simply trying  to point out that Texas gets the bulk  of the building activity and the con struction Jobs and the vast related re sources expended there.  ,1990
304,103,7,Mr. ROE.," Madam Chairman, I move  to strike the last word. I have not said  whether I am opposed or in agreement  to this amendment, but I would like to  make a couple of points.  yield  the  to  First of all, No. 1 on  the Clinch  breeder  reactor,  the United States  spent $1.5 billion of  the  taxpayers'  money as Members know. A billion  and a half dollars they expended, and  then willy-nilly 4 or 5 years later, it  was decided not to go ahead with the  Clinch breeder reactor. Why was that  decided? Who made that great deci sion along the line? Somehow in the  malaise of Congress and the adminis tration, a decision was made, regard less of where it came from, for $1.5 bil lion. Too bad. Just cancel it, throw it  away.  Do Members know what they did?  They had $1 billion worth of tubes  and  tanks,  stainless  steel  in ware houses all over. They did not come  from Tennessee or Texas, they came  from all over the country. Do Mem bers know what they did? I want every  person  in  this country  to hear me  today-they threw them away. They  sold them for scrap because somebody  changed their mind.  Now, we are talking about spending  $5 billion of taxpayers' money, $1 bil lion from Texas, and Members make  the analogy that, well,  then, we are  giving back to Texas. I remind Mem bers of something. It is $1 billion in  addition to the people's money from  Texas, above their Federal taxes. They  went to a referendum in Texas, and  the people voted, 2 to 1,  in favor of  this program. So for every dollar that  is lost here, we lose two from Texas.  Think I am from Texas? I am not, I  am from New Jersey. So let Members  get the record straight, and I  think  the issue before Members legitimately  is this: We are trying to craft a piece  of legislation that is fair and equitable  and achieves a goal. It is not the words  we are talking about. it is the result of  the  superconductor  super  collider,  what we can do, and achieve for man kind. Not building 5 million hurdles so  it is impossible to move ahead. That is  what this debate is all about. That is  what these issues are about.  Now, back to another point, we are  talking about in the way this guaran tees in established or this refund is es tablished. It has a ceiling and a limit.  It is 1995. Those tests will not be com pleted until 1993. So Texas  is not  going to get any big bundle back. They  are not going to get $1 billion back.  and if I were from Texas. and I were  putting up the billion dollars that I  am putting up, and being abused on  the floor of the House. because it is a  State's right, and I am trying to par ticipate. I am trying to build a part nership, I am putting $1 billion up,  people vote 2 to 1 in my State to build  something that was good for America,  and Members are making it now evil  and ugly that they are terrible people,  that is not fair.  I am saying to Members the level I  am talking about, I have not said yea  ",1990
305,129,7,Mr. QUILLEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I would like to  commend  the gentleman  from Virginia  [Mr.  SLAUGHTER] for requesting this time today to  honor our former colleague, J. Kenneth Robin son of Virginia.  Ken's district in central Virginia was not too  far from my own district in east Tennessee,  and on a number of occasions we worked to gether to find solutions to regional problems.  I was fortunate to serve with Ken during the  entire 14 years of his tenure in this House. He  was always a gentleman, soft-spoken, yet firm  in his convictions. He was  trusted and  re spected by his colleagues. This  trust was  demonstrated when Ken was designated  to  serve for his last 6 years in the House as the  ranking Republican member of the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence. In this posi tion he was entrusted with the Nation's most  sensitive secrets, and had the responsibility to  oversee our Nation's  intelligence gathering  agencies. He did the job and he did it well.  He also played a key role as a member of  the  Committee  on  Appropriations.  As  a  member of the Subcommittee on Defense he  worked to ensure that this Nation's defenses  remained strong. As a member of the Sub committee on Agriculture, he was able to do  much to improve the lives of family farmers in  his district and across the Nation.  His quiet strength was a great asset to the  Nation when he was a Member of this body.  ",1990
306,142,7,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, a political  sea change  in moving  throughout Eastern  Europe that is bringing democracy, and a less ening of tensions in that region.  In response  to these dramatic changes, NATO is trying to  redefine  its  role  in a new Europe  that will  surely be less threatening to Western interests  than  in previous years. Our European . allies  are planning  force  reductions and America  also envisions  troop and equipment cuts  in  Europe in response to the improving political  climate on that continent.  These dramatic changes have prompted me  to question why Turkey needs yet more mili tary equipment during this period of improving  relations between the former members of the  Warsaw Pact and NATO. I also ask this ques tion in light of Turkey's instransigence on the  Cyprus problem. Given these concerns, Con gressman YA TRON and I recently introduced a  resolution of disapproval concerning the pro posed sale of sophisticated attack helicopters  to Turkey. Given Turkey's poor track record in  using  U.S.-supplied military  hardware  on  Cyprus,  there  is concern that those helicop ters might be transferred to that island in clear  contravention of the will of the U.S. Congress.  Although we did not call for further committee  consideration of the resolution, both of us are  deeply concerned about Turkey's  failure  to  lend a hand in solving the Cyprus dispute.  It is my understanding that the administra tion may propose further sales and transfers  of modem equipment  to Turkey during  this  period  of  reduced  tensions. Should more  equipment transfers be envisoned by the ad-.  ministration, Congressman YATRON and  I will  vigorously oppose them and will call for com plete committee consideration and, possibly, a  House vote on these necessary and ill-timed  requests. Turkey must understand that there  are Members of Congress who question why  that nation should be  rewarded with more  U.S.-made military equipment while Ankara  drag$ its feet on the Cyprus issue.  The story of that small nation  is a tragic  one. For 16 years, 30,000 well-equipped Turk ish troops have illegally occupied the northern  side of the island. Ankara has consistently re fused to reduce its forces there. Many Greek  Cypriots were killed in the 197 4 invasion and  thousands are missing and remain unaccount ed for. Among the Americans who are missing  is Andrew Kassapis, a young Michigan resi dent who was taken  from his family's home  on  that  island and never seen again. Over  200,000 refugees fled to the south during the  invasion and  lost  their homes and posses sions. As if this were not enough, Turkey later  sent 60,000 settlers to northern Cyprus to live  in  the abandoned properties. Ancient Greek  Cypriot churches in northern Cyrus have been  looted and defaced and priceless mosaics  have been stolen and sold to art dealers in  Europe. Although Turkey had a major role in  creating the tragedy of Cyprus, it has played  only a minor part in the search for a solution.  Ankara claims  that  it wants a negotiated  settlement on Cyprus. But the Turkish Govern ment has done little to move the peace proc ess  forward. Not only have  the Turkish au thorities refused to reduce military force levels  on  the island,  they have used modem U.S. supplied military equipment on Cyprus. Origi nally intended for NATO defensive purposes,  use of this material in this manner is in viola tion of U.S.  law. Turkish  troops  remain on  Cyprus in clear defiance of the requests of the  United Nations, the European Community, and  the U.S. Congress.  Is there any wonder that  our allies call Turkey the only European nation  that is an occupying power and deny Turkey  membership in the European Community?  Turkey, the political and financial supporter  of  the Turkish-Cypriot  community  on  that  island,  is  the only country in  the world  that  recognizes the so-called Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus. Turkey has failed to exercise  sufficient influence on Mr. Rauf Denktash, the  leader of  the Turkish-Cypriot community on  Cyprus, to encourage him to seriously pursue  a peaceful solution to the problems that divide  the island.  Last summer, Mr. Denktash rejected a U.N. prepared draft outline which provided general  guidance  as  to  how  intercommunal  talks  should proceed. He also derailed the Secre tary General's most recent  talks on Cyprus  and has yet to agree to resume the negotia tions. U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar  deserves our admiration for his good offices  and  for his energetic  commitment  to  the  peace process for Cyprus. President Vassiliou  of Cyprus has also displayed remarkable sta temanship and  flexibility  in  trying  to resolve  the Cyprus problem peacefully and has indi cated  that he  remains  ready  to work  for  peace.  As an ally of the United States that has re ceived millions of dollars  in U.S. economic  and military assistance over the years, Turkey  must play a more positive role in  the peace  process.  It should begin by withdrawing  its  troops  from Cyprus and by encouraging Mr.  Denktash to return to the intercommunal talks  and seriously negotiate for peace. Until I see  a change of heart on the part of Turkey and  the  leader of  the Cypriot community,  I will  oppose a ""business as usual"" approach  to  our relations with Ankara.  In particular,  I and my colleagues will con tinue to maintain the 7:1 O ratio in the levels of  U.S. foreign military financing for Greece and  Turkey. That ratio will also be applied to levels  of excess U.S. defense articles made avail able to both countries. The ratio enables our  government to meet its military and security  commitments in that region while insisting that  progress be made  in  the peace process on  Cyprus. The concept of a ratio began in 1978  when Turkey sought and won a resumption of  U.S. military assistance to Ankara. In spite of  the promises and expectations at that time,  thousands  of  Turkish  troops  remain  on  Cyprus. My expectations about troop levels on  Cyprus have not yet been met and there is no  reason to abandon our insistence that Turkey  comply with the terms of the agreement.  With peace breaking out all over the world,  it is time for men of good will to focus their  energies and attention on Cyprus and settle  this oft-neglected dispute.  It  is certainly not  the time to further fatten Turkey's already for midable military arsenal.  OPPOSED TO MILITARY  EQUIPMENT TO TURKEY  HON. GUS YATRON  OP' PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 2, 1990  ",1990
307,142,7,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to call at tention to the Pentagon's proposal to sell five  AH-1 W attack helicopters to the Government  of Turkey.  I have joined my good friend and  colleague, the ranking minority member of the  House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congress man WILLIAM s. BROOMFIELD in opposing this  sale. Although the implementation of the sale  of  these defense articles  is  inevitable, Tur key's unjust occupation of over a third of the  sovereign state of Cyprus makes it necessary  that we  in Congress continue  to speak out  against the administration's efforts to strength en military ties with Ankara.  Mr. Speaker, we should be consistent  in  promoting a policy toward Cyprus based on  the same principles we have supported for the  rest of the world-human rights,  representa tive government, and nonaggression. Unfortu nately, this has not been the case.  The dispute on Cyprus is not one which fits  into the traditional East-West regional conflict  which we are now seeing resolved. Executive  branch officials have  tended  to view Cyprus  as a symptom of a larger problem between  Greece and Turkey. The notion of the U.S.  pressing for a settlement to a dispute which  may antagonize one of our friends has never  been well-received at the State Department or  the Pentagon. Even when it is clear that one  country-Turkey-is the aggressor, the policy  of  benign  neglect  remains  the  preferred  option.  Mr. Speaker, I hope that by calling attention  to this helicopter sale, Ankara will be remind ed that its occupation of Cyprus will continue  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

314,181,7,Mr. RIDGE.," Mr. Speaker, reserving  the right to object, within that reser vation, I yield to the gentleman from  New York  [Mr. HORTON],  the prime  sponsor of this legislation.  ",1990
315,181,7,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker, I am  honored to be the primary sponsor of  H.R. 3802, which calls upon the Con gress and the President to set aside  the month of May 1990,  as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.  I  am  indebted  to my  colleague,  NORMAN Y. MINETA of California, for  joining me in this effort. He has been  supportive of this legislation from its  outset and was an original cosponsor  of  the first  resolution  for Heritage  Week. As one of his last legislative ac tions, my good friend, the late Senator  Spark Matsunaga, introduced the com panion bill, S. 2111, in the U.S. Senate.  With  252  cosponsors, H.R.  3802  would amend Public Law 95-419 and  expand  the Asian-Pacific American  Heritage observance period  from  a  week to a full month.  On June 30, 1977, I had the unique  honor  and  pleasure of  introducing  House Joint Resolution 540 and later  House Joint Resolution 1007, which,  for the first time in this Nation's his tory,  asked  the Congress  and  the  people of  the United States  to set  aside a period in May as Asian-Pacific  American Heritage Week. More than  13 years ago a woman came to my  office and told my administrative as sistant, Ruby Moy, and me a very com pelling and persuasive story. Today, I  share the origin of this landmark leg islation.  The  celebration  of Asian-Pacific  American Heritage Month has a very  deep and personal place  for Jeanie  Jew and her family. Their story began  sometime in the 1800's when a young  man, M.Y. Lee, left Toishan, Canton,  China, to find a better life in America.  Mr. Lee was one of the first Chinese  pioneers to help build the Transconti nental Railroad. He  later became a  prominent  California  businessman.  When the Chinese were having diffi culties in Oregon, Mr. Lee traveled to  Oregon and was killed during  that  period of unrest. It was a time of anti Chinese and anti-Asian sentiment.The  revelations about Mr. Lee  and  the  story of Asian Americans led this one  woman to believe that not only should  Asians understand their own heritage,  but  that all Americans must know  about the contributions and histories  of the Asian-Pacific American experi ence in the United States. Jeanie Jew,  the creator of the idea for a heritage  month, is the granddaughter of M.Y.  Lee, that early pioneer.  The original  resolution designated  the week beginning May 4 as Asian Pacific American Heritage Week be cause that week included two signifi cant occasions in the proud history of  Asian Americans. May 10,  1869, or  ""Golden Spike Day,"" was the day on  which the Transcontinental Railroad  was  completed,  largely by Chinese  American pioneers. May 7, 1843, marks  the date of the first arrival of the Jap anese in the United States. Both dates  will fittingly be included in Asian-Pa cific American Heritage Month.  I want to commend the two women  who made  this event possible. Mrs.  Jew turned a personal tragedy in her  family history into a positive force.  Asian-Pacific  American  Heritage  Month will now be observed by all  Americans. I also want to thank Ruby  Moy, my administrative assistant, for  her efforts to pass this legislation. She  holds the highest professional position  to a Member of Congress. She  is a  second generation Asian American.  In 1977, Mrs. Jew and Ms. Moy co founded the Congressional Asian Pa cific Staff Caucus,  an organization  which collectively worked for the es tablishment of the first heritage proc lamation and supports yearly efforts  to  perpetuate  its  recognition. The  caucus, a group of professional staff  members of Asian descent, periodically  discusses and reviews  legislation and  issues  of  concern  to Asian-Pacific  Americans.  Sometime ago, Jeanie Jew discussed  the idea of issuing a series of com memorative stamps with several Mem bers of Congress including me. In light  of this years historical change  to a  month-long observance, it is fitting to  again request the U.S. Postal Service  issue a series of postage stamps com memorating our Nation's Asian-Pacific  American  heritage.  These  stamps  could depict Heritage Month, individ uals, subjects, or places that are signif icant in Asian-Pacific American histo ry in the United States. As a senior  member of the House Post Office and  Civil Service Committee,  I urge the  Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee  to consider issuing a stamp at the ear liest possible date.  I hope my coLeagues will join me in  supporting these stamps and in recog nizing the history and contributions of  Asian-Pacific Americans, particularly  during Asian-Pacific American Herit age Month.

352,220,7,Mr. BURNS.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of a  resolution offered last  week, by my colleague from Wyoming  [Mr. WALLOP].  The Agriculture Committee is cur rently in the process of marking up  the language that will become part of  the 1990 farm bill. There is a title for  dairy in that farm bill. There will not  be a title for beef cattle.  That is precisely the way that those  of us involved in the beef cattle indus try want it. The dairy industry repre sents an extremely difficult  line of  work. Dairymen have to be on the job,  twice a day. 365 days a year. year in  and year out. The dairy program helps  to bring some stability to that line of  work.  Cattlemen and women work within  their industry just as hard as those in  the dairy industry. And they want sta bility just as badly. To them, the sta bility comes from keeping the Govern ment out of the cattle business.  ",1990
353,233,7,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I agree  100 percent with parts of the proposal  by  the distinguished Senator  from  Delaware, but the part that I just as  violently disagree with  is  the part  which says that this amendment is a  substitute for the entire bill before us,  all of S. 135. To me, then, that is unac ceptable.  If this was made an amendment to  S. 135, I would accept it and not even  require a vote on it. I would be happy  to accept it because I  think it does  clarify that little part of it. But any  amendment that is a substitute for the  entire bill before us is certainly not ac ceptable, and this amendment, like the  previous amendment that was def eat ed by a vote of 67 to 30, just attempts  to kill the bill by offering the deal. In  this case the deal is we will release  from political bondage the heads of  the major Federal and postal unions in  return  for  continuing  the  political  bondage of nearly 3 million rank-and file Government employees. That  is  not much of a bargain to me, especial ly when the political bondage of the  heads of the Federal and postal unions  has already been addressed by  the  Federal  courts  and  protection  for  them  has  come  from  the  judicial  system.  So while I am very pleased to see the  distinguished Senator from Delaware  agreeing that the previous attempted  prosecution of the union leaders was  unfair and uncalled for, I am at the  same time sorry that he feels the need  to gut the entire bill, or to eliminate  all the rest of the bill and go back to  the original Hatch Act we are trying  to reform and improve in return for  preventing such a grossly unfair and  partisan action against the union lead ers from happening again.  I do not want to see that happen  again either, and I would not mind  putting that in the law. In fact, if the  Roth amendment was to be submitted  as an amendment to S. 135, I would be  quite happy to accept it at this time  but not as a substitute for the entire  bill before us, for all the reasons we  have given in the lengthy debate that  has already occurred on this bill. I will  not start at  this  time  to go back  through all the things we have repeat ed over and over and over again as  abuses that still are permitted to occur  under the Hatch Act in addition to  this one involving the union heads, in  addition to what we are trying to cor rect in S. 135. We are trying to make it  very clear what can be done on the job  and what can be done off the job with  regard to political activity. Take all of  this guesswork out of it so more cases  do not come up similar to the one that  involve union leaders back in that ear lier Presidential election.  Mr. President,  I must oppose  this  amendment. I do not know what the  wishes of  the distinguished Senator  from Delaware may be as far as calling  to  for a vote on this, or whether he pre fers to debate it for a while. But I am  prepared  to move  to a vote at the  present time.  ",1990

373,246,7,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join my colleagues from Ar kansas and Louisiana in a discussion of  the relationship between section 404  of the Clean Water Act and agricultur al activities. These remarks follow up  our April 30 announcement that the  Department of the Army and the En vironmental Protection Agency had  agreed to issue guidance to their field  personnel in order to clarify some of  the  confusion  surrounding  these  issues.  When Congress  reauthorized  the  Clean Water Act in 1977, section 404  was amended to exempt the following  activities:  ""normal  farming,  silvicul ture, and ranching activities such as  plowing,  seeding,  cultivating, minor  drainage, harvesting for  the produc tion of food, fiber, and forest products,  or upland soil and water conservation  practices.'' Several other activities re lating to farming, such as construction  or maintenance of stock ponds, irriga tion ditches, and farm roads are also  exempt from section 404.  to all  Recently, some farmers have learned  for the first time that, based on tech nical criteria, some of their lands are  defined as wetlands. These farmers are  concerned that they may be subject to  new regulations under section 404.  I  understand and appreciate  this con cern.  The Senators  from Arkansas and  Louisiana raised the concerns of their  farmers and asked that the agencies  who  administer  section  404  clarify  which activities are exempt from the  program. As well, these Senators are  interested  in  improving communica tion with the agricultural community  on section 404.  I wholeheartedly support these ef forts and have  joined with my col leagues from Arkansas and Louisiana  in asking the Department of the Army  and  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  to issue a clear, understand able memorandum on the section 404  regulatory program and agricultural  activities. This memorandum will be  sent  field personnel  involved  with administering section 404. Fur ther,  the corps district offices will  issue public notices and both agencies  will issue press releases to distribute  this information.  The Corps of Engineers and  the  EPA have also pledged to coordinate a  public outreach program with the Co operative Extension Service. Such a  program would likely be the most ef fective means of clearing up some of  the misunderstandings which  have  arisen  in regard  to requirements of  section 404.  Mr. President, the section 404 regu latory program is one of the most im portant tools the Federal Government  has for protecting our Nation's wet lands. The section 404 permit process  is essential in order to reduce harmful  impacts on wetlands associated with  development and other projects which  require disposal of dredged or fill ma terial.  Assistant Secretary of the  .Army Civil Works-Robert Page and Assist ant Administrator for Water La.Juana  Wilcher have been tremendously help ful over  the past  few days  as we  worked toward clarifying the exemp tions for farming under section 404. In  fact, I am pleased to note that, in gen eral, the cooperation and coordination  between the Corps of Engineers and  the EPA  in administering  this pro gram has  improved  significantly  in  recent years.  While  the Memorandum  for  the  Field printed preceding this discussion  will help get the word out to the farm  community, it is imperative that the  agencies increase efforts to cooperate  with the agricultural community and  to provide clear information to land owners  in regard to which activities  are regulated and which are exempt  under section 404.  Mr. President, I thank the Senators  from Arkansas and Louisiana for their  efforts to clarify some of the misper ceptions that so often surround the  section 404 regulatory program.  AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES EXDIPTION TO  SECTION 404  ",1990
374,246,7,Mr.  BREAUX.," Mr.  President,  I  would like to commend my colleagues  for their work on this complex and im portant issue. The distinguished Sena tors from Arkansas, Senators PRYOR  and BUMPERS, and my senior colleague  from Louisiana, Senator  JOHNSTON,  have been very active and diligent in  addressing  the  uncertain  situation  faced by our Nation's farmers. Like wise, the chairman of the Committee  on Environment and Public Works,  Senator  BURDICK,  and  our  distin guished  ranking member,  Senator  CHAFEE,  have been most helpful  in  joining with us to clarify the operation  of  the section 404 program of  the  Clean Water Act and its effect on agri cultural operations.  In recent days we have worked with  the Corps of Engineers, the Environ mental Protection Agency, the Depart ment of Agriculture, and the White  House in a cooperative effort to see to  it that farmers receive equitable treat ment  under  the  404  program,  to  ensure  that  the  regulatory agencies  share a common understanding of the  application of the program to agricul tural activities, and to improve the ef forts of the Federal Government to  communicate  effectively  with  our  farmers on the kinds of activities that  are, and are not, within the scope of  the program.  Mr. President, the documents that  we are including in the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD today will, I hope, significant ly clarify for both the farm communi ty and the regulators at the field level  the scope and extent of the section 404  program and its application to normal  farming activities. The corps and EPA  have committed to work actively with  the  Department  of  Agriculture  through  its Cooperative Extension  Service to help those involved in agri culture to better understand the 404  program and  to see  to  it  that our  farmers do not inadvertently violate  the law. Congress has provided specific  exemptions from the 404 program for  normal farming, ranching, and silvicul tural  activities. With  the  recent  changes  in  the wetland delineation  methodology, it is particularly impor tant that our farmers, many of whom  have never previously been affected by  the  complex  regulatory  program  under section 404, be well  informed  and be assured that continuing their  normal farming practices will not re quire new burdens or subject them to  potential violations of Federal law. I  commend these documents to the at tention of all of my colleagues.  ",1990
375,259,7,Mr.  RIEGLE.," Mr. President,  last  week, the administration made a seri ous mistake when it failed to identify  trade  in auto parts and accessories  with Japan as a  trade  liberalization  priority under the Super 301 provision  of the 1988 Trade Act. Indeed, by fail ing to name any new trade liberaliza tion  priorities,  the  administration  strayed  in no uncertain  terms from  the intent of Congress. The confer ence report to the Omnibus Trade and  Competitiveness Act of 1988 clearly  stated that the changes made to Super  301 in conference were ""not intended  to result in the identification of only  token practices and countries.""  The administration's decision sends  the wrong signal to Japan at a key  moment for both the auto parts and  semiconductor industries. Ambassador  Hills Justified her decision on auto  parts in part by arguing that negotia tions are in process on this topic in the  structural  impediments  initiative  talks. Mr. President, auto parts negoti ations with  Japan  have  been  in  progress in one form or another since  1986. After nearly 4 years, American  companies continue to wait for signifi cant results. Without further action  by  their Government,  I  am afraid  their wait will be in vain.  The structural  impediments  initia tive, however well  intentioned,  is at  root little more than another in a long  series of promises of future progress  by  the  Japanese Government. The  structural impediments initiative talks  provide  no mechanism  to measure  whether general  promises  translate  into changes in behavior and increases  in American sales. The auto parts in dustry has already  lived  through 4  years of promises. It is unacceptable to  ask it, as the administration in effect  has, to live through another 4 years of  empty promises.  The industry does not have 4 more  years  to wait;  it  is already on  the  threshold of a serious crisis. Produc tion by  foreign  auto  companies  in  North America rose from zero in 1980  to over a million cars in 1988. It is ex pected  to double again-to approxi mately 2.5 million cars-by the end of  this year. At the same time, GM, Ford,  and Chrysler have been slashing pro ductive capacity. As a  result,  in the  space of less than a decade, foreign  auto manufacturers have taken over  more than one-fourth of all auto pro duction in North America.  This change in the auto industry in  the 1980's has powerful implications  for the parts industry in the 1990's. A  1989 study by the General Accounting  Office for Chairman BENTSEN  found  that Japanese car companies  in the  United States rely on their family of  affiliated suppliers for over 60 percent  of their components. By contrast, the  Big Three source nearly 90 percent of  their  components  from  traditional  American companies. Since the trans plant assembly operations coming on  line are by and  large replacing Big  Three production, the traditional auto  parts industry stands to lose as much  as in the next 2 or 3 years as the Big  Three have lost in the past five.  It would be one thing if American  firms were destined to lose this busi ness  on  competitive  grounds. But  there is evidence that the same unfair  trade  practices  that  have  blocked  United States exports to the Japanese  market are now blocking United States  sales to foreign subsidiaries in our own  market. In addition,  there is signifi cant  evidence  that  Japanese  parts  firms  are  underpricing  traditional  American firms in the United States  market, despite an adverse foreign ex change rate, because they earn higher  profits from a captive home market  that is maintained by blocking foreign  access. This is an all too familiar pat tern of Japanese industrial success. Fi nally, for cyclical reasons, auto sales  are expected to be weak in the near  term, and a  recession would compli cate matters even further.  Accordingly, as the foreign share of  auto  assembly  in North America  grows, the threat to traditional Ameri can upstream industries, like the parts  industry, will grow unless steps are  taken to ensure that: First, the trans plants make procurement decisions in  the United States on the basis of the  same competitive principles as the Big  Three;  and  second,  Japanese parts  companies lose the artificial advantage  of a closed home market.  Mr. President, we cannot allow the  anticompetitive  practices  that  are  common  in Japan  to  take  root  in  American soil. The best time to influ ence this matter is now, as the trans plant assembly operations are coming  online and still forming their supply  relationships. We must exert the nec essary pressure before the die is cast.  The stakes are too high-in terms of  Jobs and our technological and indus trial base-to take a wait-and-see atti tude for another few years.  For this reason, I am pleased to in troduce with bipartisan and industry  support a bill sending the clear mes sage that the U.S. Government will  not be content merely to conclude an other round of negotiations. It expects  early, meaningful results and will take  concrete steps to measure such results,  or the lack  thereof,  in  the market place.  The bill requires semiannual reports  containing data detailing the extent of  increases in auto parts sales by tradi tonal United States firms to Japanese  assemblers in both the United States  and Japanese markets. The  lack of  data  in this form has hindered the  market oriented sector specific negoti ations process since  its  inception in  1986. Without it, progress cannot be  measured  accurately. And without  meaningful public accountability, Jap anese companies are under less pres sure to mend their ways.  The bill creates Department of Com merce and International Trade Com mission reports to produce data on tra ditional United States company ex ports to the Japanese market and sales  to foreign  transplants  in the North  American market,  respectively. The  Commerce Department report is not a  new report; it is a refinement of the  existing reporting requirement of the  auto parts provision of the 1988 Trade  Act, the so-called Quayle amendment.  In addition to these two reports, the  bill requests a study from the Depart ment of Justice to determine whether  there is sufficient validity to reports of  anticompetitive  practices  by  trans plants in the U.S. market to warrant a  more formal antitrust investigation.  Finally, the bill calls for a section  301 investigation with respect to auto  parts trade with Japan.  Again, Mr. President,  the adminis tration made a  serious mistake  last  week  in  failing  to maintain strong  pressure on Japan in the critically im portant area of auto parts trade. Con gress should respond by taking these  actions  in view  of  the  long  track  record of minimal progress on United  States-Japan auto parts  trade,  the  large share of our bilateral trade defi cit attributable  to auto parts-over  one-fifth-the lack of available means  in the structural impediments initia tive to measure results, and the fact  that the industry is at a critical Junc ture due  to  the continuing replace ment of Big Three plants by trans plant operations and a possible reces sion.  Indeed,  this  is  a  pivotal moment  both for the U.S. auto parts industry  and for U.S.  trade policy. Mr. Presi dent, this bill is no substitute for the  need to extend and strengthen Super  301, which I will continue to work on  with my colleagues. Rather, the bill is  an effort  to  take more  immediate,  practical steps to prevent a crisis in an  ",1990

378,298,7,Mr. LAFALCE.," Mr. Speaker, in the following  remarks given by Mr. Hans Angermueller, for merly of Citibank, at a recent conference in  New York on the restructuring of the banking  industry, Mr. Angermueller makes  two very  fundamental and compelling points. First, the  position of the United States in the new world  order that is emerging will be a function of its  economic  strength,  rather  than  its military  might. Second, the competitive disadvantages  facing U.S.  financial  institutions constitute a  fundamental threat to that economic strength,  and may adversely affect our economic well being.  I concur with Mr. Angermueller's conclusion  that we must move quickly  to  reform  the  structure of our financial services industry, and  I commend his remarks to the attention of my  colleagues.  WILL THE U.S. BANKING  COllPE'tuivE  IN  THE  PLACE?-CoNCERNS or AN Ex-BANKER  INDUSTRY REMAIN  GLOBAL MARKET <Remarks by Hans H. Angermueller>  My thesis is quite simple and, if you are  an American, quite disturbing. In a world  order which  is more and more becoming  based on economic, and not military might,  the efficiency with which a nation's finan cial  institutions can facilitate the flow of  capital from the ultimate suppliers to the  ultimate users of capital will be a major  factor in determining that nation'f econom ic well being and its position in the global  marketplace.  In my view, foreign financial institutions  are today much better positioned than U.S.  financial institutions to mobilize capital and  help direct it to its most productive uses.  Foreign financial institutions have the flexi bility to respond to changes in the market place. U.S. financial firms do not.  Foreign financial institutions have the op portunity  to  diversify  and  to  tap  new  sources of revenue. U.S.  financial  institu tions do not.  Foreign financial  institutions can there fore expect to be stronger and more com petitive than U.S. institutions. Consequent ly in today's global marketplace, U.S. insti tutions operate at a disadvantage not only  in the  international markets, but  in  the  United States as well.  This is bad news not only for U.S. finan cial institutions, but given the pivotal role  that financial institutions play, there will be  adverse consequences for the U.S. economy.  For almost half a century, the military  confrontation between  the U.S.  and  the  Soviet Union has  led  to  their respective  roles as the world's superpowers. However,  it is now becoming increasingly clear that  the world leadership role of the U.S. can no  longer be based on  its  rivalry with  the  Soviet Union. The U.S. must adjust its pri orities in a world in which other nations ag gressively pursue their own economic inter ests and are becoming less dependent on  U.S. military strength. This means that the  U.S. must position itself to remain competi tive  in the global marketplace which,  in  turn, means that U.S. financial institutions  must be able to operate effectively in that  marketplace.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  However, that marketplace is undergoing  fundamental  and  irrevocable  changes.  Today, as we are all aware, major advances  in information technology, shifts in savings  from depositories to mutual funds and pen sion funds and the use of options, futures,  swaps and other derivative instruments are  revolutionizing the business of finance.  As a result, financial institutions can now  disassemble any financial asset into its basic  risk components and recombine those basic  components  into a new  instrument with  completely different maturity, liquidity, in terest-rate,  foreign  exchange  and  credit  characteristics. This enables the users and  the suppliers of capital, including interme diaries themselves, to determine how much,  and what kind of, risk they wish to bear.  Accordingly,  instead of traditional inter mediation by banks and insurance compa nies on the one hand and securities distribu tion and trading by investment bankers on  the other hand, we are moving  toward a  world of financial engineering and adminis tration-all provided in a highly integrated  global marketplace peopled by new inves tors using new techniques.  What has been the reaction to these basic  and continuing changes in the world of fi nance?  Most OECD countries are in the process  of taking, or have already taken, the steps  necessary to permit financial institutions in  their countries the opportunity to adapt to  this changing financial marketplace. They  are doing this by permitting their financial  institutions  to exercise a broad range of  powers and thus to offer their customers  whatever combination of products and serv ices they may demand and which the insti tutions feel competent to provide.  These countries are developing a regula tory climate that is hospitable to a global fi nancial services business. The premier ex ample is the U.K. But other countries are  also streamlining their financial systems for  defensive reasons-to prevent any further  erosion of their position. All of them are  doing so because it makes good economic  sense-they know that job creation, physi cal investment, and the efficient allocation  of scarce capital are all at stake.  In preparation for 1992, countries within  the European Community are rapidly dis mantling  the remaining barriers between  banking,  securities,  and  insurance.  In a  blunt report on where European banking is  headed, Sir Leon Brittain, Vice-President of  the Commission of the European Communi ties, recently told a Washington audience  that  the European Community  ""in one  bound,        has moved from twelve frag mented and confusing structures of national  (banking) regulation to a single market of a  size and simplicity unmatched anywhere  else in the world."" He took pains to point  out that the EC is not taking these steps  ""merely to benefit banks     We are doing  it to increase the competitiveness of Europe an industry by giving it access to the cheap est, most efficient, and most innovative fi nancial products in the world.      So don't  say you weren't warned!""  With  incentives  like  this,  the Japanese  Ministry of Finance is speeding up the proc ess of exploring options for the future of  Japan's financial system. The betting is that  Japan will move toward some form of uni versal banking system soon.  In sum, public policy toward the financial  sector in other parts of the developed world  is changing rapidly and, from the point of  view of their financial institutions and their  customers, it seems to be changing for the  better.  May 3, 1990  The result is that today, by and large, for eign banks are better capitalized, more flexi ble, more responsive, and better rated than  are the major U.S. banks. And this has re sulted in the markets valuing their shares  much higher than those of U.S. banks. That  permits them to raise new capital on much  more attractive terms which, in turn, facili tates their ability to grow, to acquire, and to  compete  in  the key markets around  the  world. For example,  foreign banks hold  more than 25% of the total assets of the  U.S. banking system. U.S. banks hold no  way near this percentage of assets in any  foreign banking system.  What,  in contrast, has been happening  within the U.S.  in response  to the basic  changes in the world of finance? The short  answer is, at best, ""basically nothing"".  Without a major restructuring of our laws  and regulations, I am afraid that U.S. finan cial institutions will be relegated to playing  bit parts on  the world  financial services  stage. Handicapped by a weak domestic  franchise, U.S. financial institutions gener ally. and U.S. banks in particular, face a  narrower range of options than do foreign  institutions. U.S. banks may withdraw into  the United States. Indeed, many U.S. banks  have already cut back substantially on their  operations overseas. Others may retain a  global presence, but only in selected mar kets or for selected groups of customers.  Still others may find it necessary to find a  foreign partner or seek adoption by a for eign parent.  Unfortunately,  continued Congressional  inaction and preoccupation about the feder al safety net actually threaten to make mat ters worse. It is conceivable that further  rhetoric about the federal safety net with  no action will turn U.S. depository institu tions  into quasi-public utilities  that will  serve as the repositories of the nation's junk  credits. It is noteworthy that U.S. commer cial bank write-offs <excluding LDC  re serves) in the last five years were $60 bil lion. That is more than twice as much as the  write-offs during all of the 1950s, 1960s and  the 1970s!  Indeed, I see U.S. banks frantically com peting within their limited domestic sectors;  assuming ever greater risks for ever smaller  rewards simply to stay on the top of the  league tables; granting their ""star"" employ ees extraordinary compensation even when  performance has been mediocre or poor;  and, at the same time, cutting back on less  heralded employees to show some measure  of profit. One wonders whether the U.S.  economy,  in which  today 35  large bank  holding companies hold about one-half of  all U.S. banking assets, really needs all of  the 13,000 banks plus 3,000 thrifts that we  have. Perhaps a smaller number of larger  institutions operating in a national market  with greater flexibility and less constraint  might be better for  the public  interest- even though perhaps not for the special in terests.  Bad as this picture of U.S. banking may  be, it could even get worse, for I see some  disturbing parallels between  the banking  crisis of 1933 and the thrift crisis of 1990.  In 1933, the Congress believed that the se curities activities of banks were largely re sponsible for the stock market boom and  bust and contributed to the high rate of  bank failures. It did not matter that there  was absolutely no evidence to demonstrate  that this was true. Everyone acted as if it  was. Now, more than 50 years later, it is  widely acknowledged that the banks that  failed in the 1930s failed primarily because  ",1990
379,311,7,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  in  1982, a bright-eyed preppy came to Washing ton, DC, sensitive and willing to learn. Even  with her confidence, she  remained  in awe  over the big city and indeed, the wonders of  the world.  As an intern in the office of her Congress man, Julie began to explore the Nation's Cap ital and all that makes our Government work.  Her  first professional  responsibility was  to  serve as receptionist to California Congress man  RICHARD  LEHMAN.  She  eventually  became executive manager for ""Rick's Kids""  as she carried out program coordination for an  endless string of congressional interns.  Highlighting Julie's stay in Washington was  her selection as California's Cherry Blossom  Princess and participating  in  the pomp and  pageantry of the 1982 Cherry Blossom Festi val. Julie also celebrated her 21st birthday  during  her Washington  tour  and  Arthur  became a part of her life. None of us will ever  forget him coming down with ""Parvo,"" or that  frantic car ride to the veterinary hospital, and  finally a call from Dr. Connell saying ""We've  saved Arthur.""  In a very special way,  that  week  reflects  the blossoming of a young  woman, a growing sense of life's possibilities,  and a new level of caring.  Julie came to realize that while there was  so much to see and do  in this world,  there  was also much to learn. After working on Cap itol Hill, she became convinced that the next  chapter  in  her  life's adventure would  be  school. So,  it was  back  to  fundamentals  before selecting a final path to conquer the  world.  Before turning that page, Julie and her dear  friend, Cindy, set a course for the Caribbean  HONORING JEANNIE DIGGS OF  JACINTO CITY, TX  HON. JACK FIELDS  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 1990  ",1990
380,311,7,Mr. FIELDS.," Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to  read  recently  that one of my constituents,  Jeannie Diggs of Jacinto City, TX, has won  the  prestigious  Thomas  Jefferson  Award  which honors individuals in the greater Hous ton area who demonstrate outstanding public  service benefiting their local communities.  Tomorrow, Jeannie and nine other recipi ents will be presented with bronze medallions  at  the 13th annual KTRK TV awards break fast. All the recipients will appear on channel  13's ""Good Morning Houston"" show  tomor row.  I have had the good fortune to know and  work with Jeannie since  I first entered Con gress. Jeannie serves as director of Heritage  Hall, a senior citizens community center in Ja cinto City.  It has been my pleasure  to visit  Heritage Hall and to talk with the seniors who  participate in its many activities on numerous  occasions.  I've stopped by to discuss issues affecting  senior citizens, I've dropped in to offer assist ance to individuals who were having problems  with  the Social Security Administration, and  I've even held town meetings there. I can't re member a time when  I visited Heritage Hall  when Jeannie wasn't there helping her neigh bors and friends.  But Jeannie  isn't always at Heritage Hall.   She  recently began a program designed  to  teach illiterates how to read, and she also in augurated a volunteer service  that delivers  meals  to home-bound senior citizens  in Ja cinto City.

381,324,7,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I appre ciate Senator McCAIN'S effort to come  to grips with  the uncertainties our  military personnel and their families  face as our forces build down over the  next few years.  I too am concerned that we provide  fair and equitable  treatment  to our  men and women in uniform and their  families who may be affected by re ductions  in force-particularly  those  who have committed to a career in the  military and now will not be permitted  to have it. I think that the transition  services that Senator McCAIN proposes  have merit and I certainly expect that  we will  review  them carefully when  the Subcommittee on Manpower and  Personnel of the Committee on Armed  Services meets to mark up the fiscal  year 1991 Defense authorization  re quest.  With regard to providing separation  pay to personnel who are involuntarily  separated, I believe that there may be  compensation alternatives  that  treat  our military personnel more  fairly.  For example, I am exploring the feasi bility of vesting military personnel in  the retirement system at an earlier  date. I do not know whether we can do  that or not, but it is certainly worth a  try.  Civilian personnel  in  the Govern ment and  in  the private sector are  vested  under  various  schedules  as  early as 5 years of employment under  the Employee Retirement Income Se curity Act CERISAl. I expect to have a  military vesting option that builds on  the ERISA concept for consideration  by the time the subcommittee marks  up.  I want  to also note  that Senator  COHEN  introduced a bill, S. 2352, on  March 28 that would extend involun tary separation pay eligibility to en listed personnel. This pay is currently  entitled to certain officers who are in voluntarily separated. So I expect we  will consider this proposal, as well as  Senator McCAIN'S proposal,  in  our  markup.  I  share Senator McCAIN'S concern  that there is a great deal of uncertain ty among our military personnel about  how big the military strength cuts are  going to be  in the future and what  kind of compensation we will provide  to  those who are given a pink slip.  Right now, I do not have any figures I  can lay out. I have asked for figures  from  the Department  of Defense  which I have yet to receive. That tells  me that the Department of Defense is  not sure of what the numbers are at  this point. I do know that the way the  defense budget is shaping up for fiscal  year 1991 that relatively large cuts in  near-term strength levels are practi cally inevitable.  Whatever  the  reduction  though,  I  am committed  to ensuring that our  men and women in uniform and their  families are fairly  treated. I am not  sure that any or all of the proposals  that have been put  forth  thus  far  truly provide equitable compensation  on a systematic basis to those who will  be  adversely  affected by  the  force  build down. Of course, these proposals  are well intentioned and I believe we  should carefully consider all of them.  At the same time, I believe we need to  make sure we have explored all op tions, such as vesting to make sure we  have a coherent, comprehensive pack age that in the end is fair to our mili tary personnel and their families.  As chairman of the Subcommittee  on Manpower and Personnel of  the  Committee  on Armed  Services,  I  pledge to work to accomplish this end.  I look forward to working with Sena tor McCAIN.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem pore. The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant  legislative clerk pro ceeded to call the roll.  ",1990

383,324,7,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Delaware is recognized.  TAX FREEDOM DAY  ,1990
384,324,7,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President, May 5  marks Tax Freedom Day for 1990, ac cording to the Tax Foundation. This is  the day that the American taxpayer  stops  paying  the Government  and  starts working for him or herself.  Up to this point in the year, the av erage  taxpayer has worked  to earn  enough to cover Federal, State, and  local taxes. Tomorrow, May 5, the tax payer can finally begin to enjoy his or  her own earnings.  Unfortunately, May 5  is  the latest  Tax Freedom Day ever. This reflects  the 34 percent of income the average  American will  fork  over  in  taxes  during  1990.  Tax  relief  is  clearly  needed, and could be provided with  projected defense savings. But Con gress  is poised  to  fritter  away  the  peace dividend on a huge spending  spree, pushing tax freedom back fur ther and further in the 1990's.  Instead, we should return the peace  dividend  to  the people by  reducing  their tax burden. This is why I have  introduced S. 2530, the Roth defense  rebate.  Over 5 years, my bill would cut the  15-percent bottom tax rate by 20 per cent.  It would also  trim  the 28-percent  rate  in  the next bracket applied  to  middle-income Americans by 10.7 per cent.  Once phased in, my defense rebate  would produce annual savings of $600  for a married couple with $20,000 of  taxable income, and $1,500 for a mar ried couple with $50,000 of  taxable  income. By shifting resources back to  the private sector, they will be used by  savers,  investors,  and  consumers  in  ways which  provide more  benefits  than costs.  Our economy and taxpayers are al ready groaning under the weight of fi nancing $1.2 trillion in Federal spend ing. This spending level is expected to  rise to $1.5 trillion by the mid-1990's.  Surely, this is a sufficient amount of  resources  to  address  our Nation's  needs.  By now, it should be clear that none  of the peace dividend will actually be  used for deficit reduction. It will be  spent several times over by the time  we are through. By promoting reckless  spending,  congressional  retention of  ",1990
385,337,7,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, before I  respond briefly, I would like to make a  correction in some remarks I made a  little while ago, in response to the dis tinguished floor manager on the mi nority side, when I  responded to his  comments about Common Cause, the  Federal Bar Association, the Chamber  of Commerce, and the International  Personnel Management Associations,  and their remarks.  I believe  the  remarks which  they  had made about coercing and money,  and so on, were made basically on the  House bill, on the legislation that has  been passed over there. I wanted  to  note that because if that is the case, I  want to point out to those people that  their opposition to what we are trying  to do here may be ill founded because  we are not talking about that legisla tion. What we are talking about is leg islation passed  in  the Senate. The  House bill does some things that are  very  questionable  from  the Senate  standpoint.  So I want to make sure that that is  understood.  Let me respond a little more direct ly. With the amendment that we have  before us by the distinguished Senator  from Delaware, it would seem to me  that you open the floodgates  to the  filing of hundreds, perhaps even thou sands and thousands, of lawsuits and  for no purpose as far as deterring vio lations under the Hatch Act.  Each time a person does not get a  raise, will there be some who will say,  ""Well, I was coerced and therefore I  did not respond to that coercion. And  so that is the reason I did not get a  raise and that is unfair, and I am filing  a suit""? Each time a person does not  get an assignment they want, they will  say, ""Well, that person tried to coerce  me, and fwould not go along with it. I  was Simon Pure on that, and I would  not go along with that. And so now I  am being penalized,  and  I will  file  suit.""  Or each time a person does not get a  transfer they want to some new place,  when there is a new job open some place and they are refused a transfer,  they say, ""Well, OK. They  tried  to  coerce me and did not, and they are  trying to hold that against me, and I  did not get that transfer,"" or what ever, and so they file suit.  S. 135, with the amendment I read a  few months ago, deals very strongly,  forcefully,  impartially, with  anyone  who tries to coerce another person in  Federal employment, whatever  that  coercion may be. They can get up to 3  years in jail; they can get a $5,000 fine,  and I do not think that is too small. I  think that is pretty hefty, and if any thing is going to deter prohibited ac tivity under the Hatch Act, increasing  the penalty  to  that amount should  certainly do it. That is in the legisla tion before us.  So, Mr. President,  if anyone  else  wishes  to  speak on  this,  I will be  happy to have them do so. Otherwise,  I would be prepared, at whatever time  is agreeable to the distinguished Sena tor from Delaware, to move to table.  ",1990
386,337,7,Mr. ROTH.,"  I  just have one com ment, Mr. President. I would like to  point out  that  the Common Cause  letter from which I  read was dated  September 13, 1989. We have a more  recent letter, dated May 2, 1990. The  most  recent  letter, of course,  came  within the week.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the letter dated May 2, 1990,  from Common Cause be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  Common Cause,  Washington, DC, May 2, 1990.  DEAR SENATOR: The Senate is soon expect ed to take action on legislation to amend  the Hatch Act which for 50 years has pro tected federal employees from  inappropri ate  political  pressures.  Common  Cause  strongly urges you  to oppose S. 135,  the  Hatch Act Amendments of 1989. This bill  seeks to make basic changes in the current  Hatch Act restrictions on partisan political  activity by  federal workers, opening  the  door to implicit coercion, and abandons the  fundamental  concept of an unpoliticized  civil service.  The House-passed bill, H.R.  20, would  repeal Hatch Act protections and for the  first time in 50 years allow federal civil serv ice and postal employees to participate in  partisan political activity. For example, fed eral workers could run as candidates in par tisan elections, serve as officers of a political  party,  raise  partisan  campaign  contribu tions, manage campaigns, and administer  political  action  committees  <PACs>. The  only restraint is  that the partisan activity  would  have  to  occur  during  off-hours.  Common Cause opposed the passage of H.R.  20.  S. 135 also proposes major changes in the  Hatch Act, lifting most restrictions on parti san political activity. Like the House bill, a  federal  employee  would  be  permitted,  among other things, to serve as an officer of  a political party or a PAC, become a public  campaign official for a candidate, and run  as a delegate to a national convention. The  Senate bill does prohibing federal employ ees  from  running  for  partisan  political  office and from soliciting contributions for  partisan candidates. However, it allows gov ernment workers to solicit their colleagues  for contributions for their own federal em ployee PACs.  Repeal of the Hatch Act's basic protec tions, as proposed in S. 135, would increase  the potential for widespread abuse and open  the way for implicit coercion against which  there is no real protection. With basic re strictions on partisan activity repealed, no  procedural or other safeguards will be suffi cient to protect against subtle forms of po litical  favoritism  or  coercion  of  federal  workers.  It is important to recognize that under the  current Hatch Act,  federal workrs are al ready permitted to engage in various politi cal activities. For example, they may make  political contributions to candidates, serve  as rank-and-file members of political par ties, and engage in nonpartisan political ac tivities. It is only the most active levels of  partisan participation from which they are  currently barred. In drawing this line, we  believe. that the current Hatch Act strikes  an appropriate balance between the federal  worker's ability to participate in political ac tivities and the public's right to fair and im partial administration of government.  Common Cause recognizes that the cur rent  regulations governing administration  of  the Hatch Act are complicated. There  may be ways  to clarify and simplify  for  workers the degree of participation they are  permitted under the Hatch Act without lift ing the basic restrictions on partisan activi ty. We would urge the Senate to instead ex plore  this possibility. As a core principle,  however, a careful balance must be struck  between an  individual's First Amendment  right of free speech and association and the  public's right to impartial administration of  government. We believe S. 135 upsets this  balance and would open the possibility of a  dangerously politicized civil service.  The Hatch Act was designed  to ensure  that the federal government is administered  in a fair and impartial manner. We agree  with the U.S. Supreme Court which stated,  in upholding  the constitutionality of  the  Act, that ""it is in the best interest of the  ",1990

388,350,7,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, yesterday,  my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle unveiled their campaign finance  reform plan. I congratulate them on  their efforts.  Although the plan's legislative lan guage  is not yet available-and al though I have not seen a  list of co sponsors-I know  that virtually  full  public financing of Senate campaigns  is one of the plan's key elements. I  also understand  that  the Democrat  bill does absolutely nothing to curb  labor union soft-money abuses.  PUBLIC FINANCING  Last Tuesday,  the Senate Republi cans unveiled their own campaign fi nance reform initiative. The initiative  now has 34 cosponsors, and I expect  additional cosponsors to come onboard  next week.  I am pleased  that the Republican  bill rejects public financing outright.  No excuses. No burdens on the Ameri can taxpayer. And no taxpayer financ ing of politicians.  If history  teaches us anything,  it  teaches us that public financing is bad  public policy, and it is very, very ex pensive.  The  last  three  publicly  financed  Presidential  elections  ate  up more  than $500 million in hard-earned tax payer money-and what is worse, the  system just did not work.  Believe me, I have been there. I have  seen the Presidential system up close.  And, today, I am still being audited by  the  Federal  Election  Commission,  more than 2 years after my own Presi dential campaign folded up its tent for  good.

389,363,7,Mr. DECONCINI.,"  I ask unanimous  consent that the statement of Prime  Minister Prunskiene, as presented to  the Helsinki Commission on May 3,  1990, here in the U.S. Senate be print ed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the state ment was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  REMARKS OF THE PRIME MINISTER OF LITHUA NIA, KAZIMIERA Pl\UNSKIENE TO THE HEL SINKI COMMISSION, THURSDAY, MAY 3, 1990  For some  time now, Lithuania and her  Baltic neighbors have been reminding the  world of the fact of their existence and, by  doing so, have aroused worry as well as in terest.  The Lithuanian question did not arise be cause it was arbitrarily willed by someone or  in order to frustrate someone else's will and  desires. The restoration of an independent  Lithuanian state was a legal act, expressing  the nation's self-determination and its right  to full sovereignty. By international agree ment, this is a political right of all nations.  The most important preconditions for the  restoration of independence were:  1. The Lithuanian nation's long-standing  desire, shared by the other two Baltic na tions, for independent statehood, which was  given expression by its democratically elect ed parliament.  2. The refusal of other states around the  world to recognize the annexation of Lith uania by the Soviet Union.  3. Political changes under Mr. Gorbachev  which permitted the Soviet Union itself to  declare the Hitler-Stalin pact null and void.  The act entitled ""On the Restoration of  an  Independent Lithuanian State"" which  was passed by the Lithuanian parliament on  March 11 begins to establish our state sover eignty. We have enacted a legal, de jure sov ereignty which will require much effort and  a certain amount of time in order to be real ized de facto.  By no means does the Lithuanian parlia ment and government believe that de facto  independence can be grabbed unilaterally  and quickly, especially when dealing with  the Soviet Union with its deep-rooted impe rial traditions.  Lithuania does not want to burden Mr.  Gorbachev with her problems, complicating  his situation and raising a danger to his  leadership or to perestroika, a danger that  has been dramatized  around  the world.  Lithuania also does not want to shift her  problems onto the West. Nevertheless, these  three sides-the Soviet Union, Lithuania  and the West-are drawn together through  the Lithuanian issue. How the question is  solved will depend first of all on the people  of Lithuania themselves, on their unity, de termination, calm and so long as the eco nomic blockage lasts, on their stamina and  enterprise as well. The people are showing  the world tht they do have those qualities.  The roles of East and West in the resolu tion of the Lithuanian question are compli cated by a series of factors:  1. The Soviet Union does not have a bal anced equilibrium of political  forces. Al though  the  influence of  the democratic  forces is increasing, it is not yet equal to the  other side. The democratic forces are only  starting  to  consolidate  and  often  clash  among themselves. From what I have ob served, Mr. Gorbachev does not make full  use of support from the democratic forces  to overcome the reactionaries.  2. The western nations, thanks to whose  non-recognition policy Lithuania was able to  preserve  the legal continuity of her inde pendence, became accustomed to her factual  dependence. They valued Mr. Gorbachev's  perestroika as a way of ensuring human and  national rights to the point that the process  began to be valued more than the goal-the  realization of these rights.  It is difficult for the West to perceive that  pressuring the Soviet Union on the Lithua nian question helps rather than hinders Mr.  Gorbachev to be a consistent practitioner of  democracy more than that, to overcome the  reactionary forces which oppose not only in dependence for the Baltic states but also po litical and economic reforms in general. The  West's position now, during a period of eco nomic difficulties for the Soviet Union, can  be one of the most important arguments for  a decisive  turn to reform. This argument  would have been  ineffective several years  ago, for it is only now that the people dare  to contradict the government and raise de mands.  Lithuania  is undergoing a great testing,  but so too is the Soviet Union as well as the  West. What sort of Russia or Soviet Union  will emerge depends  in part on how  the  Lithuanian issue will be resolved. This is un",1990

In my opinion, this would be the in evitable result of this legislation. Pro ponents of this legislation do not seem  to appreciate  the expectations,  the  pressure, and the coercion that will  spring forth if this legislation is en acted. Few of us would find it appro priate for employees of the Federal  Election Commission to be president  or treasurer of the Democratic or Re publican  National  Committees  at  night and then serve as umpires over  partisan politics by day. This legisla tion would allow that. My amendment  would prevent it.

And  what kind of confidence would that in spire  in the American people to see  these Government officials attempting  to administer in a nonpartisan fashion  the affairs of government by day and  the  running of partisan politics at  night?  In upholding the constitutionality of  the Hatch Act in United Public Work ers, CIO versus Mitchell, the Supreme  Court considered the question of off duty political activity. The majority  held:  We do not find persuasion in appellant's  argument that such activities during free  time are not subject  to  regulation even  though admittedly political activities cannot  be indulged in during working hours. The  influence of political activity by government  employees, if evil in its effects on the serv ice, the employees or people dealing with  them, is hardly less so because that activity  takes place after hours.  This is a very important statement  And this proposed S. 135 attempts t~  divide or separate political activity by  the fact of whether one is on duty or  off duty. And, as the Supreme Court  points out. I think very succinctly, it  makes  little difference whether  the  ",1990
396,415,7,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join the distinguished chair man and ranking Republican member  of the Education Subcommittee in co sponsoring an amendment to correct a  problem which has arisen with impact  aid payments to school districts affect ed by the Base Closure and Realign ment Act <Public Law 100-526).  In 1974, Congress  recognized  that  the failure to provide a gradual reduc tion in impact aid payments to school  As a  districts  experiencing  a  sudden de crease  in the enrollment of Federal  students resulting from the closure of  military bases would create havoc with  the budgets of those school districts.  result,  the Education Amend ments of 1974  included  language  to  provide phase-down assistance over a  period of 4 years to such school dis tricts. This  language  entitled  local  education agencies meeting certain cri teria to receive phase-down assistance  equal  to 90 percent of the agency's  previous year's entitlement,  thereby  providing a gradual reduction in their  impact aid assistance payments.  Mr. President, these hold harmless  provisions have not been used since  the last round of base closures during  the mid to late 1970's. In preparing for  the new round of base closures under  the Base Closure and Realignment  Act, I have discovered that a recent in terpretation of  the 1974 statute by  general counsel at the Department of  Education will result in a precipitous  loss of payments to school districts at tempting to cope with base closures.  Portsmouth, NH, will be  the first  community  in  the country  to cope  with the closure of a military base. Ac cording  to  information provided by  the Department of Education  and  based upon this new general counsel  interpretation of the statute, impact  aid payments to Portsmouth would de crease from $2,361,500 in the 1989-90  school year to $318,800 in the 1990-91  school year, the first school year fol lowing the closure of Pease Air Force  Base.  In other words,  this general  counsel interpretation undermines the  intent of the statute's phase-down pro vision.  Mr President,  I  have used Ports mouth as an example because it is the  one school district for which there is  reasonably  accurate  data  on  the  number of affected students. However,  while Portsmouth will be  the  first  community in the Nation to cope with  the closure of a military base, it cer tainly will not be the last. I believe it  is critical  that we do not abandon  these districts who have been educat ing our military children  for many  years on the basis of what I believe to  be an erroneous general counsel deter mination. Congress clearly intended to  provide a gradual and orderly phase  down of Federal assistance when  it  adopted this hold harmless provision  in 197 4 and I believe that it is critical  that we maintain  the  commitment  made at that time.  I have carefully reviewed the legisla tive history surrounding  the enact ment of the 1974 statute, and as I indi cated, I do not believe that the De partment of Education is correct in its  interpretation. However,  the willing ness of my distinguished colleagues to  work with me to uphold the original  intent of the statute, makes the ap proach taken by this amendment preferable to a contentious and drawn out  debate with the Department over the  need  to protect  these affected dis tricts. This amendment makes minor  changes in section 3<e> of Public Law  81-874 to clarify that school districts  coping with base closures are in fact  entitled to gradual phase-down assist ance over a period of 4 years.  Mr. President, the amendment au thorizes appropriations necessary  to  carry out the phase-down provision to  ensure that payments to school dis tricts affected by base closings will not  adversely affect other impacted school  districts, which have not incurred a  loss of students. The amendment also  directs the Secretary of Education to  make available  to  the Congress,  in  annual  budget  submissions,  the  amount of funds necessary to defray  the costs associated with the phase down provision. If Congress is to ade quately address the needs of the af fected school districts, it must have in formation concerning the number of  affected districts and students and as sociated costs.  Finally, I would like to thank Sena tors PELL and KASSEBAUM and  their  staffs for their assistance and willing ness to resolve this problem in an ex peditious fashion.  ",1990
397,415,7,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President, I  would like to voice my strong support  for. the pending amendment to section  3<e> of the impact aid statute.  We are all familiar with section 3 of  Public Law 81-874, which provides fi nancial assistance for local education  agencies in areas where Federal activi ties increase the number of children a  district must educate. Section 3 pay ments are allocated based on enroll ment of  two  types of students: stu dents whose parents live and work on  Federal property <category A>.  and  students whose parents live or work on  Federal property <category B>.  However, section 3<e>, which author izes phase-out entitlements to school  districts losing a substantial number of  Federally connected children due to a  reduced Federal  presence,  is  often  overlooked. Specifically,  section 3Ce>  provides eligible school districts with a  3-year phase-down of hold harmless  payments to minimize the trauma of  large scale Federal reductions. These  payments are calculated at 90 percent  of the prior year's category 3<A> and  3CB> entitlement.  The fact that section 3<e>  is often  overlooked  is  somewhat understand able  considering  that more  than a  decade has elapsed since it was last ap plied. However, the imminent closure  of several military bases, as mandated  by the Base Closure and Realignment  Act, has renewed public interest and  attention toward the Impact Aid Pro gram. This scrutinty has identified a  significant inequity within section 3<e>  which, if uncorrected, will wreak eco",1990
398,441,7,Mr. GLENN.," I yield myself 2 min utes.  Mr. President, when the Hatch Act  was passed, there were no such things  as PAC's. They are not even addressed  in the Hatch Act. I agree thoroughly  with the Senator from Wyoming that  we need campaign reform. I think we  also need  to make  the Hatch Act  something workable. That is exactly  what this bill does. It says all vagaries  that have come out through the years  with all the different things under the  Hatch Act will now be clarified, be cause now, for once and for all, you  will be able to know exactly what you  can do on the job, which is nothing,  and off  the  job what you can do,  which is limited, but you still cannot  make solicitation for political contri butions to the general public nor can  you run for elective office. That is all  it does.  Mr. President, I do not want to see  us  tie  these  two  things  together.  I  think it is unwarranted. That is the  reason I opposed the proposal by the  distinguished Senator from Wyoming.  There is no reason to wait. The Hatch  Act needs reform even if there is never  a campaign reform bill, which I think  there is going to be, and I understand  it is going to be brought up shortly.  Whether or not there is a campaign  reform bill, we need the changes made  by S. 135 to the Hatch Act. That is the  reason I oppose this particular legisla tion.  I know we are going to start voting  in about 4 minutes here. I do not know  if the Senator from Wyoming wishes  to address the third amendment, if it  is going to be brought up or not. We  only have about 4 minutes. I ask the  Chair how much time is remaining on  both sides.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem pore. The Senator has 4 minutes, 18  seconds remaining. The Senator from  Delaware used all the time allocated  under the previous order.  ",1990

401,441,7,Mr. GLENN.," Mr.  President,  the  third one is the one that Senator DOLE  is going to bring up. I believe that he  submitted it yesterday and it involves  putting additional  restrictions on  to  Government employees of FEC, IRS,  CIA, and Department of Justice. Laws  restricting those people and what they  can do are already on the books. I see  no need to repeat them here. I read  into the RECORD yesterday all the dif ferent  things  in  the United States  Code right now involving what they  can do and cannot do and that they  cannot use their official positions or  information gained on the job, such as  IRS, CIA, FBI, Department of Justice,  they cannot use information gained on  the job to go out and use it politically.  If they do, they are in trouble under  other parts of the United States Code,  and should be. This bill does not open  up any avenues for them whatsoever.  It does not take away any restriction  from other legislation at all.  Mr. President,  I  am prepared  to  yield back all time and go to the vote  and start the vote. I believe the first  vote is 15 minutes with two 10-minute  votes to follow; is that correct?  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem pore. The Senator is correct.  ",1990
402,441,7,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, as a co sponsor of S. 135, I feel strongly that  reform of the Hatch Act is long over due. I have worked hard since my ar rival in the Senate to restore political  rights of Federal workers.  In 1976, as a freshman Senator and a  member of the Post Office and Civil  Service Committee, I supported legis lation that would have provided broad er Hatch Act reforms than those in  the bill we are presently debating. Un fortunately, President Ford successful ly vetoed that bill.  Opponents  of Hatch Act  reform  have been able  to prevent Congress  from  taking up this important issue  until now. Under  the  leadership of  Senator GLENN,  the Senate is finally  once again ready to approve legislation  to ease the restrictions on political ac tivities of Federal workers.  Mr. President, when the Hatch Act  was originally passed in 1939, political  patronage was  the rule rather than  the exception for employment in the  ",1990
403,480,7,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I rise  today with Senators GRASSLEY  and  HOLLINGS  to introduce the Physician  Regulatory Relief and Improvement  Act of 1990. This legislation will lessen  the burden that Medicare places on  our Nation's physicians. Our bill  is  similar  to  legislation  introduced by  Congressman  Roy  ROWLAND  and  others last month.  Medicare is one of the most impor tant Federal programs we have today.  In terms of the effect it has had over  the years in improving quality of life  for its beneficiaries, Medicare has vir tually no competition. For our Na tion's seniors, Medicare has meant  freedom from worrying about how to  pay hospital and doctor bills.  But there is a downside to Medicare.  More and more, physicians and pa tients across the country are becoming  demoralized  over  the  increasing  amount of Government regulation in  Medicare. In spite of all that is good  about Medicare, it is rife with rules  that benefit none and are a constant  burr in the shoe of many. These non sensical rules excessively burden our  health care system and threaten  to  undermine  the  quality  of  care  of  which we are so proud.  Mr. President, increasing red tape much of it unnecessary and sometimes  even harmful-is the end result of a  budget-driven  system which  substi tutes short-term economic paper gains  for  long-term sensible health policy making.  Excessive  regulation  is  destroying  the close personal relationship doctors  have traditionally had with their pa tients. It's interfering with good medi cine by denying procedures to patients  which they request, and which physi cians feel are needed. Red tape is inun dating doctors with paperwork causing  many others to withdraw from Medi care participation, making health care  less accessible  to many people. Even  many prospective doctors are deterred  by red tape, which is cited as a major  factor in a 25-percent decrease in med ical school applications over the past 5  years.  In a time when many parts of the  country-including half the counties  in my home State-are suffering seri ous physician shortages, this overzeal ous  regulation can have very grave  consequences for access to health care.  An article from a recent series in the  New York Times on medical payment  and practice changes in the 1980's cap tured the physician's perspective:  The feeling of being shackled by rules and  overseers is nearly universal among doctors  today, experts inside and outside the profes sion say. Doctors say they are overwhelmed  by paperwork, prohibited by insurance com panies from doing procedures and subjected  to scrutiny by group employers like health  maintenance organizations that can even in clude scheduling of restroom breaks.  Mr.  President,  this  bill  is  badly  needed  to  reduce  the  regulatory  burden that Medicare imposes on well intentioned physicians who  are  re spected  by  their patients but  are  always suspect in the eyes of Medi care. The changes we are proposing  are few, and relatively minor, but to gether they can help restore an envi ronment of faith and confidence that  in the past has always characterized  the country's health care system.  The legislation proposes the follow ing changes:  To require the mandatory release of  medical parameters and screens that  are used to determine which Medicare  claims might need individual review.  To prohibit Medicare carriers from  charging physicians for information or  documents that are reasonably needed  to comply with Medicare  statutory  and regulatory requirements.  To allow physicians in solo practice  and those in another group practice to  ",1990

WILLIAM D. FORD.  Since November 3, 1964, Mr. FoRD  has been a diligent Representative of  his home State of Michigan. Among  other accomplishments, his service on  the Post Office and Civil Service Com mittee is worthy of merit and procla mation of praise before his peers. Mr.  FORD has served as chairman of the  Committee on Post Office and Civil  Service since 1980, and during  that  time he has vigorously promoted the  U.S. Postal Service and civilian agen cies and has adamantly demanded im proved pay and benefits for those em ployed by our Postal Service and other  Government agencies. He has led his  committee to the forefront of public  service and,  in so doing, has earned  the respect and admiration of those  with whom he has worked. The offi cial unveiling of Mr. FoRD's portrait on  March 21, 1990 was a timely occasion  to honor a man who has done so much  for his Government and his  fellow  man.

As part of the celebration of Small Business  Week, I wish to congratulate a small business man  from my district, Mr. Arthur Brady of  Arthur Brady Associates, Inc. in Party Amboy,  NJ. Mr. Brady has been named the ""Regional  Small Business Subcontractor of the Year for  for  this  Region  II,"" having been nominated  award by a client, Hughes Aircraft.  A decade ago, Arthur Brady established a  commercial materials  testing  laboratory with  one employee. His company, Arthur Brady As sociates, has grown since 1980  into a firm  with 1 O employees who operate not only the  testing lab but also a manufacturing division to  make solder for electrical equipment, specifi cally for printed circuit boards.  ""A dynamic team of creative problem solv ers"" is how Mr. Brady describes his employ ees, but is clear that such creativity and dyna mism flows from the company's founder. Mr.  Brady, who previously worked  for AT&T and  General Motors as a chemist, is originally from  Jamaica, and has become an American citi zen. He has worked hard to publicize his com pany's products and has built a client base  which includes such customers as ITT, Allied  Signal, DuPont, and  IBM. His success stems  from quality service, fair pricing, and consist ency in the delivery of a good product. These  attributes have enabled  the Department of  Defense to qualify his company for the Quali fied Products List, a designation within DOD  of high-quality products.  He has contributed  to his community not  only by the product he provides but through  the jobs he has provided  in both Middlesex  and Union County, NJ.  I am proud  to con gratulate Mr. Brady and his employees on  their efforts and wish them continued success  in the future.  ",1990

As a small businessman  myself, let me say I am especially honored to  have this opportunity to recognize the industri ous spirit of my small business peers.  As American's, we have all benefited from  the  innovation and  industry of our entrepre neurs. It is only appropriate that we set aside  this week to celebrate their accomplishments  and  recognize  the attributes of  their enter prise. The success of American small busi ness is at the heart of our Nation's unprece dented history of peace and prosperity. Our  acclaimed traditions of ingenuity and produc tivity are embodied by the daily efforts of our  small business people, and are envied by  people the world over.  As  the walls of  isolation and oppression  crumble throughout the globe, it is appropriate  that this year's theme suggests the continu ation of American business leadership into the  21st century. Today, opportunity for innovation  and  industry  is  tantamount. New challenges  associated with  the emerging democracies  and  the need  for environmental  technology  beckon for American ingenuity. As legislators,  we must encourage small business participa tion, and enlist their expertise as we assist in  the transition of Eastern Europe to democrat ic, free enterprise states.  I  thank my colleague, Congressman  IRE LAND, for taking the initiative to recognize the  small  business  community.

FA Sebring Elementary began their MilJion  M'lllUtes Reacing Program at the begjnning of  the 1989-90 school year. The goal of the pro gram was to get the 40 students of Sebring  Elementary  read  for  1 million minutes  during  the school year.  If a student reads  more than 100 minutes in a month their name  would be put in a drawing for the book of the  month. Area businesses and the local parent  ~tion donated the book and also a bicy cle which was given as a grand prize.  The students kept track of the minutes read  by placing  stickers  in  the hallway of  the  school. This enabled  the students  to keep  track of their total minutes read as well as vis ualize what a million really looks like. The stu dents were also allowed to have reading part ners outside  the school who could donate  minutes  read  to  the contest One of these  partners was FU'St Lady Barbara Bush.  ~r.

Additionally,  I  would like to voice my support for the school's  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  efforts in stressing the importance of reading  to our children  It is imperative that we all learn the value of  education and the ability to be able to read.  The number of adults who may not be able to  read, write, speak, or otherwise communicate  competently enough to meet the demand of  modem society. has increased significantly. It  is through Federal, State, and  local efforts,  such as the Celebration of Rea<lng. that we  can work to combat  this problem and rein force in our young people the importance of  learning to read  I am always pleased to hear of illcividuals,  such as those participating in the Celebration  of Reading, who have helped to show young  people how reading is important in their lives.  The students, parents, and staff of John Sloat  Basic School also are to be commended on  their efforts to help make this special celebra tion a success.  RT.  REV.  MSGR.  ACHILLE  J.

424,584,7,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the accomplishments and efforts of  an untiring public servant of the State of Cali fornia, State Senator Henry Mello. I am grate ful  to have  this opportunity  to express my  gratitude and appreciation for his tireless work  ",1990
425,597,7,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to pay tribute to the Kew Gardens Synagogue  Adath Yeshurun, which will mark its golden ju bilee with a dinner dance on May 13 at the  Beth Sholom Synagogue in Lawrence, NY.  The Kew Gardens Synagogue is one of the  oldest Jewish congregations  in  the central  Queens area of New York City. Those who  established  the synagogue came  from many  different ethnic backgrounds, including many  who escaped  the Holocaust  in Europe and  were able  to come  together  to establish a  congregation that has been a place of prayer  and charity for the past 50 years. In that time  the synagogue has witnessed its congregation  grow  from a modest 14 congregants  to  its  now thriving community of 380 active mem bers.  The Kew Gardens Synagogue throughout its  50-year history has been more than a house  of worship. Founded by the late David Levine,  it has fulfilled the need for community services  for Jews and gentiles alike. The services the  synagogue provides to the community include  a nursery school, youth activities such as little  league baseball and sports programs  for all  children, sabbath youth groups, educational  and cultural programs for men and women, in cluding  study groups and  cultural  lectures  given by reputed individuals from outside the  synagogue. The synagogue has also devel oped  special  programs  to  support  single  parent families, and assist recent  immigrants  from the Soviet Union in adapting to life in the  United States.  The many programs and activities were ex pended through the years under the steward ship of many dedicated men and women.  I  would especially like to honor: board of trust ee members David Weil, Richard Koppel and  Amon Hiller; Vice-Presidents Gregory Bin kiewicz and Hymen Arbesfeld; Treasurer Eli  Mirzoeff; Financial Secretary Noah Diamond;  Correspondence Secretary Simon Mietles; and  Recording Secretary Nathan Rahimi  for their  timeless dedication over the years to the Syn agogue and the Kew Gardens community. At  present,  the synagogue  is  led by President  Fred Friedman  in partnership with Rabbi Dr.  Barnard Rosenweig, the spiritual leader of the  Kew Gardens Synagogue. These men, with  the help of the other members of the syna gogue, have worked diligently to adapt to the  ever changing needs of  the Kew Gardens  community.  The Kew Gardens Synagogue has survived  many trials and tribulations during its first half  century, but it has survived and prospered as  a place the community turns to in times of joy  and need. I would like to ask my colleagues to  join me in congratulating Kew Gardens Syna gogue Adath Yeshurun on its 50th anniversary  and to extend the hope that the next 50 years  will be as successful as its first.  9727  FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF  CHERNOBYL  HON. STENY H. HOYER  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 8, 1990  ",1990
426,597,7,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, with each pass ing anniversary of the April 26, 1986, Cherno byl nuclear disaster, we learn more and more  about the devastating toll on  the surrounding  population and environment. Within  the  last  few months, information about the full extent  of  this  tragedy, previously concealed by  the  Soviet Government, is slowly coming to light.  The devastating consequences .of Cherno byl, Mr. Speaker, are found everywhere. The  consequences are  found  in  the poisoning of  the  surrounding  environment,  with  many  places unfit  for human habitat;  farm animals  born  deformed;  deadly  crops,  berries  and  mushrooms. They are found in the astounding  economic consequences which, according  to  estimates by Soviet economists, amount  to  over $300 billion.  But much more  importantly,  the  conse quences are  found  in  the devastating effect  on human beings. They are  found  in  lives  lost-some 300, according  to Yuriy Shcher bak, a deputy chairman of the U.S.S.R. Su preme Soviet's Environmental Subcommittee.  They are  found  in  the deterioration of  the  health of thousands upon  thousands among  the surrounding population  in Ukraine, Byelo russia and  the Russian republic, as  the  inci dences of leukemia, thyroid cancer and other  radiation-related  illnesses among the popula tion have grown dramatically and continues to  grow. The consequences are also  found on  the faces of these surrounding populations faces which display fear, uncertainty, and anx iety about the future. Indeed the psychological  effects of Chernobyl-both on  those who  were  uprooted  and  evacuated  from  their  homes and  on  the many  thousands who  stayed unknowingly when  they should have  been evacuated-may be as traumatic as the  physical effects. And, Mr. Speaker, the conse quences are found in a crisis of trust in official  Soviet bodies  that confused or hid  the  full  tragedy of Chernobyl.  At long last, Soviet officials are beginning to  recognize  the profound crisis of  trust  that  Chernobyl engendered and are beginning  to  address its effects. The Ukrainian ministry of  health, with its new head, Yuriy Spizhenko, is  increasingly  revealing  Chernobyl's medical  consequences. And on April 22, the U.S.S.R.  Council of Ministers accepted a new 16-bil lion-ruble plan  to assist Chernobyl's victims  over the next 3 years.  That the truth is emerging about Chernobyl  and some action is being taken is due to per sistent pressure by independent groups such  as green world and  the popular movement  Rukh  in  Ukraine which  fought  to  break  through the Soviet Government's ""conspiracy  of silence."" In the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, 80  miles  from Chernobyl, 70,000 people  turned  out for a commemorative meeting on the April  26 anniversary sponsored by Rukh. Leaders  of the demonstration called  for a drastic re duction of  the nuclear energy  industry and  ",1990
427,636,7,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President,  reply briefly and then at the appropri ate  time move  to  table  the amend ment. I do not believe anybody else  wants to speak.  Mr. McCONNELL.  If the Senator  from Ohio will yield, I will need 30 sec onds and I am through.  ",1990
428,636,7,Mr. GLENN.," That is fine.  Mr. President, let me respond to the  remarks of my colleague from Dela ware. Once again we hear this rhetoric  being  trotted out that this  is some  kind of political grant. I never heard  anything any more ridiculous, when  all we are trying to do is clarify some  of the uncertainties of the law right  now.  Of course, the Hatch Act is needed. I  agree with that. But I want to make it  workable. I want to make it do some thing, not be so confusing that nobody  knows what  is occurring. So,  once  again, to refer to S. 135 as a repeal of  the Hatch Act is just not true. I have  corrected this quite a number of times.  We are talking about the rights of  the American  public  to  vote. Of  course, they need Federal laws admin istered  in a nonpartisan manner.  I  agree with that 100 percent, and that  is exactly what S. 135 does. It says  that on the  job you cannot do one  single  thing  that  is political. That  tightens up the law.  Under a spoils system which existed  at one time, the Hatch Act was passed  to protect people  from  coercion.  I  agree with that 100 percent. There al ready is protection against coercion in  law. What we do specifically in this  bill  is  exactly  the same  thing-the  amendment by ",1990
429,636,7,Mr. ROBB.,"  The objective is,  indeed, to protect  the employee and protect the public,  and what we do is make that a work able  line so  that people will under stand what is happening.  The 3,000  interpretations  that we  ref er to,  those were folded  into the  Hatch Act when it was passed and  have not all been done away with yet,  as witness the examples I have given  on the floor many times. They have  not all been distilled down to where  there are very clear rule and regula tions. Otherwise, why would we need  something like a hotline for Federal  employees to call to get an interpreta tion of whether they can or cannot do  something? Is it not a ludicrous situa tion that the law is that unclear? And  yet that is what we have. We have to  establish a hotline so people can call  in and say, can I stuff envelopes, or  am I going to be charged with a viola tion if I stuff some envelopes down  here in the boiler room some place? Or  can I go to a political rally? What can  I do? We have to have a hotline to try  to describe these different interpreta tions that have grown up and been  there under the Hatch Act through a  good part of its existence since 1939.  All this bill tries to do is clarify some  of that so that, exactly as the Senator  from Delaware said, the public is pro tected, the employee is protected be cause they now will know without ben efit of a hotline that they cannot do  anything political on  the  job,  that  they cannot even wear that infamous  buttons we have talked about on the  floor repeatedly. So we tighten it up in  that respect.  On the other hand, we keep some of  the restrictions outside, such as no  raising of political funds from the gen eral public and not running for public  office. The House bill permits both of  those. This is a  long-needed revision  that S. 135 has made.  Mr. President, with regard  to  the  amendment by the Senator from Ken tucky,  the basic point is we do not  need all the same things, and that is  what took us so long, we had to re search  this. We were  trying  to go  through  line  by  line  and  search  whether each item in there is covered  in some way under existing law. As I  said  in my remarks a  few moments  ago, we have determined that they are  covered under other law so we do not  need  this amendment. That  is  the  reason I rise to oppose it. Whenever  the sponsor of the amendment has fin ished, I will be prepared to move to  table.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in  conclusion, it is the view of the Sena tor from Kentucky that the present  law does not cover this situation. Fed eral and postal workers presently must  finance, through their union dues, po litical causes that they in fact may not  support. My amendment is about the  Hobson's  choice  that Federal  and  postal workers currently are present ed. The Hobson's choice, Mr. Presi dent, is this: Pay union dues and gain  the right to vote on terms of employ ment. But under present law, a portion  of  their dues may  go  to  support,  through soft money, a candidate or  candidates that the workers may vehe mently  oppose. That  is  the  first  choice. If you pay your dues in order  to gain the right to participate in a  collective-bargaining agreement, your  money can be diverted  to political  causes in which you may not believe,  or as a Federal worker or postal em ployee, you choose not to pay the dues  because you do not want to provide fi nancial  assistance  to  those whose  views you do not support. Only under  present  law you  lose your voice on  vital terms of employment issues.  So  the purpose of  the McConnell  amendment is  to eliminate the Hob son's choice and to eliminate in the  ",1990
430,649,7,Mr. SANFORD.," Mr. President, I rise  today in recognition of the outstand ing  achievements  and  contributions  the small businesses of America have  brought to our society. The zealous  and  innovative spirit which  led out  pioneers across this uncharted conti nent leads our small business owners  today in a business climate that offers  new challenges and practices in this  new global marketplace.  The theme for this week is ""Small  Business: Leading America  Into  the  21st Century"", I believe it is appropri ately named as  the small businesses  are demonstrating their creative and  inventive talents in adapting to global  markets and new product designs. In  the wake of the political changes in  Eastern Europe  are  new  economic  freedoms. The changing Eastern Euro pean  countries  are  turning  to  the  small  business  community  in  the  United States to study how the free  enterprise system works  in a demo cratic society.  I am very proud of the accomplish ments of small business in the United  States. With over 20 million  small  businesses  in America  today,  small  businesses employ 6 out of every 10  working people. Small businesses also  ""account for the majority of new jobs  and are more immediately responsive  to changing demographics, economic  patterns, and shifting markets than  larger firms.''  The pioneers and the entrepreneurs  of small business should be commend ed this week, and should be remem bered as we draft and pass legislation  which affects the business community.  In speaking with business leaders in  North Carolina I have come to under stand  how  our  spending  priorities  affect our small businesses.  I  have  heard complaints from small business  owners that there  is a  lack of ade quately skilled and literate workers. I  have heard  complaints  from  small  business owners that there is insuffi cient roadway systems for consumer  and manufacturer accessibility. I have  also heard complaints from business  leaders about the increasing costs of  capital.  I would hope that we  in Congress  adopt the spirit of the small business  person and strive to be creative and in novative in providing funding for our  human  resource and education pro grams to ensure that our public is lit erate and employable. And I also hope  we possess the courage of the pioneers  as we work to deal with the increasing  Federal deficit and growing budget  problems.  Lastly, Mr. President, I would like to  congratulate  every  small  business  person in America, and express my ap preciation to them for their determi nation and their many achievements. I  especially would  like  to extend my  congratulations to Mr. Tony A. Pope,  president of Catawba Transportation  Group,  Inc., of Claremont, NC,  the  State  small  business winner  from  North Carolina. Mr. Pope, through his  family business, exhibits the dedica tion and drive that is so characteristic  of small business leaders. I hope that  we continue  to  recognize  the many  benefits  brought  to  our  society  through the small businesses of Amer ica, and try our best in Congress to  emulate their courage and conviction  to purpose.

431,649,7,Mr. HATCH.," Mr.  MUST SIGNAL SUPPORT OF  COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY  President,  the  recent  foiled plan by  the Medellin  drug cartel to purchase sophisticated  stinger antiaircraft missiles and other  advanced United States weapons dem onstrates the degree to which the drug  cartels will go to undermine and desta bilize democracy in Colombia.  According to reports, the suspects in volved  in  the scheme expressed an  urgent need to have the weapons de livered before the May 27 Presidential  elections; and by their own admission,  these stingers were  to be used ""to  shoot down Colombian Government  helicopters"" and ""to send a message  because the Government was getting  too close to Pablo Escobar."" It is clear  the drug cartels will do whatever is  necessary to build a public consensus  against the Colombian Government's  antinarcotic efforts, even if it means  bringing down the Government.  Three  Presidential  candidates  al ready have been assassinated by the  drug cartels. How many more must be  murdered? Hundreds of police offi cials,  judges,  and  innocent men,  women, and children have been mur dered by  the drug  traffickers. How  many more must be victimized by this  callous disregard for democratic rule,  disrespect for the rule of law, and in difference to human rights?  Mr. President, it should be clear by  now that the drug cartels will go to  any extreme to satisfy their ambitions.  ",1990
432,662,7,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join my colleagues as a co sponsor of the Homelessness Preven tion  and Community Revitalization  Act of 1990. This legislation is an ex cellent complement to the initiatives  contained in the McKinney Act.  Too often in this body we fall to ad dress the root causes of the myriad  problems we  face. This  legislation,  however, is different. It is designed to  prevent  homelessness.  Shelters,  of  course, are a necessary component of  the solution to homelessness, but shel ters do little to actually confront the  root causes of homelessness.  The solution to homelessness is com plicated and involves many needs that  have to be met. This legislation au thorizes discretionary grant money to  provide social services to three specific  populations: Families with young chil dren; persons with debilitating health  problems; and the chronically mental ly  ill. Grants are also authorized to  promote  Community  Development  Corporation involvement in the provi sion of low income housing.  I am particularly excited about the  family  support center concept con tained  in  this  legislation. Various  housing authorities around the coun try have begun to develop such cen ters, including the Housing Authority  of Portland, and I am pleased to join  in this effort to encourage further de velopment of such centers. These cen ters would be established in or near  low-income  housing. They  are  de signed to provide an array of social  services to very low income families,  particularly those families that have  been homeless or are likely to become  so.  Services  to be provided would  in clude health and mental health serv ices, nutritional services, drug and al cohol counseling, family crisis and do mestic violence counseling, child devel opment  programs,  child  care,  job  training, and parenting classes. By en couraging the provision of such serv ices to low income families, we go a  long way toward preventing such fami lies from losing their homes. We are  adopting clear measures that address  the root causes of homelessness.  This  legislation also begins  to ad dress the needs of those low income  persons with chronic or debilitating  health conditions who have been or  are at risk of becoming homeless. Spe cifically, grants would be authorized to  provide health services to low-income  elderly, those who are HIV infected,  and the chronically mentally ill. Serv ices would include home health care,  case managemnt, meal services, sub stance  abuse  counseling  and other  care.  The Homelessness Prevention and  Community Revitalization Act of 1990  will not solve this country's homeless  problem. It will, however, assist in pro viding the infrastructure necessary to  prevent people from becoming home less. An individual or family on the  brink of losing their home needs to  know  that services are available  to  bring them back from the brink. This  legislation, I believe, will begin to pro vide the reassurance and stability that  the homeless so badly need.  ",1990
433,662,7,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  I am proud to join Senator KENNEDY,  Senator DODD and other colleagues in  supporting the Homelessness Preven tion  and Community Revitalization  Act of 1990. This bill is a compassion ate measure designed to extend sup port and assistance to families and in dividuals who are hovering on  the  brink and at grave risk of becoming  homeless.  Homelessness is a national tragedy.  No State, no community is  immune .  Repeatedly, we  see  in  the national  news the tragic picture of families and  individuals living on the streets of New  York and Washington. We read about  families struggling to raise children in  temporary  shelters. The Affordable  Housing Institute estimates that be tween 4 to 14 million families live ""on  the knife edge of homelessness."" Un fortunately, West Virginia has its own  stories of homeless people. We also  have too many families struggling in  substandard housing, on the brink of  homelessness.  Americans recognize the tradegy of  homelessness. National surveys show  that people want  to do  something  about  this problem. For example, a  recent Washington Post-ABC News  poll indicated that 2 out of 3 Ameri cans believe homelessness is a major  national problem, and 7 out of 10 said  that they would even pay more taxes  to build shelters for the homeless in  their areas.  ':'his legislation is an important step  toward combating homelessness. It fol lows the old saying, an ounce of pre vention is worth a pound of cure. The  bill seeks to prevent homelessness by  offering  support  and  assistance  to  those most vulnerable-families living  in public housing, individuals suffering  from chronic or debilitating  illness,  and others in need.  This measure  seeks  to  establish  family support centers in or near low income housing. The centers would  provide a wide variety of services to in dividuals and families to prevent vul nerable people from slipping into ho melessness. The centers would offer  health and nutritional services, drug  and alcohol counseling, family crisis  and  domestic  violence  counseling,  child development programs, job train ing, education and parenting classes.  These are basic needs that should be  met.  The bill also includes home health  services targeted to low-income hous ing and neighborhoods to provide sup port services necessary to give people  the option of living at home rather  than entering a nursing home or insti tutional care facility.  I am a strong  proponent of home health care. With  some help-a visiting nurse, periodic  visits by a homemaker, or respite care  relief for the primary caregiver-many  Americans would be able  to stay in  their own homes rather than enter a  nursing home or some type of institu tional care. People want  to stay  in  their own homes. It is more comfort ing. It is more compassionate. It is an  important health  care  option  that  should be expanded.  This bill  is an  important, positive  step toward preventing homelessness.  I am pleased to support this measure  which is aimed at helping low-income  families and individuals stay off the  streets, and I believe it is a wise invest. ment.  I  also  recognize  that our Nation  must invest in more affordable hous ing to meet the needs of families, sen iors and others struggling to keep a  roof over their heads. There is much  to be done  to prevent homelessness  and  revitalize our communities and  neighborhoods.  The  Homelessness  Prevention and Community Revital ization Act is a solid step forward.

434,662,7,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, today I  join my distinguished colleagues, Sen ator KENNEDY, chairman of Labor and  Human Resources Committee,  and  Senator DODD, chairman of the Sub committee on Children, Family, Drugs  and Alcoholism, in introducing the Ho melessness Prevention and Communi ty Revitalization Act of 1990. This im portant  legislation will off er much  needed  assistance  to  the  growing  number of Americans who are home less.  Mr. President, the problem of home lessness  is growing  in my State of  Iowa. A study by researchers at Drake  University for the State of Iowa which  was released this past December, iden tified a much  larger homeless and  near  homeless  population  in  Iowa  than in previous studies. The study  found that 15, 713  Iowans are home less. And what  is  the largest group  within the homeless population? Trag ically, it's children. 8,405, or well over  half of all homeless Iowans are chil dren. This study also found that the  number of people who are near home less-those who would be homeless  without entitlements such as fuel or  rent  assistance-has  reached  over  68,000. Of these near homeless, over  25,000 are children.  Homelessness  is  a very  complex  problem with many interwined causes.  Another recent study  indicates  that  homelessness  in my State is  largely  rooted in economics. A 1986 report by  ",1990

Even though the House passed a bill,  significant differences of opinion exist  within  this body  regarding most of  those issues.  But I think the House did settle one  issue emphatically. It does not support  the ABC provisions of the Senate bill.  My motion  simply  instructs  the  House conferees on  that particular  issue  to  support  the existing clear  House  position  by  rejecting  those  Senate provisions. It underscores the  existing  clear House  position. No  more. No less.  It's very troubling to hear now that  the conferees being named today may  not, in fact, constitute a working ma jority in support of the House position  on this cornerstone issue. That's why  this motion to instruct is so important.  The House  rejected  the ABC ap proach for good reason. The Federal  Government already has 28 day care  programs.  We do not need a 29th, in the form  of a redundant new preschool program  which has the potential to create an  elaborate new bureaucracy at the Fed eral and State levels.  We already have a preschool grant  mechanism that has been in existence  for nearly 30 years. The title XX grant  program-which is part of the Social  Security Act-provides the States with  $2.8 billion  to spend on social pro grams of  their choice.  In practice,  every State but one spends title XX  money on day care.    Here's what  title XX supports: A  Federal mechanism to send the money  to the States; a State mechanism to re ceive the Federal money and allocate  it to day care providers or local gov ernments; mechanisms at  the  local  level to allocate the money to provid ers; an elaborate set of rules and pro cedures at the State and local levels  governing who has the right to apply  for the money, what they must do to  apply, how it is decided who gets the  money and how much, and what the  money can be used for; and a mecha nism to assure that day care financed  by title XX dollars is in accord with  State and local quality standards.  The point is, the House chose not to  create a  redundant, costly new pre school day care grant program when  we already have one with the inherent  flexibility of the title XX program.

446,727,7,Mr. WHITTAKER.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume. I will reserve the balance of my  time at the conclusion of my speech  for other speakers.  Mr. Speaker, as an original cospon sor of this transportation legislation, I  am proud  to  reaffirm  the Nation's  commitment to Amtrak as part of our  national transportation system. As we  begin to survey the condition of the  Nation's transportation infrastructure,  and to consider the economic and envi ronmental costs of various forms of  transportation, Amtrak's role as a pas senger carrier of high energy efficien cy and low environmental impact be comes  even more  important  than  before. I know that in my own part of  the country, with the severe shrinkage  of the intercity bus system, Amtrak  has become even more important as a  vital transportation link for our small and medium-sized communities, many  of which do not have air  transport  service.  In fact,  there  are  literally  scores of such communities around the  country, where Amtrak is one of the  few  remaining  transportation  links  connecting these towns with the rest  of the Nation. More than one out of  every  five  communities  served  by  Amtrak has no air service; another one  in five has no bus service. For these  towns, Amtrak is truly a vital connec tion to the economic and social fabric  of the Nation.  I also want to stress that Amtrak is  almost unique  among Federal pro grams, in that it has managed to in crease its level of service to the public,  while  cutting  its  Federal  funding  roughly  in half  in constant dollars  over the last decade. How many other  Federal efforts can we name that have  achieved that kind of efficiency and  productivity? These results are also a  tribute  to  the outstanding manage ment skills of Graham Claytor, Am trak's president during most of that  time period.  Sadly, I have to acknowledge that  despite the bipartisan support for this  Amtrak legislation, the administration  is on record as opposing it-primarily,  and to all appearances, exclusively, be cause of a provision giving the Inter state  Commerce  Commission  the  power to screen takeover. bidders who  are not already in the railroad busi ness, before they are allowed to pro ceed with a bid for control of a major  rail carrier.  I can only say that I have to con clude that much of this opposition is  due to being misinformed. This provi sion, which closely tracks a bipartisan  bill drafted in the Energy and Com merce Committee, only closes a non sensical gap in the current law. A com pany or an individual who wants to go  into the railroad business on a small  scale by buying even a few miles of  track from a major railroad must seek  ICC approval. But if the same person  or company wants to enter the rail road business by taking control of a  major railroad in a single stroke, the  ICC has no effective means of scruti nizing the bidder and protecting the  transportation system from a possible  railroad bankruptcy or similar disas ter.  The  takeover  provision  in  the  Amtrak bill addresses this situation in  a moderate, carefully  targeted way.  First, the ICC is not put in charge of  determining  the outcome of control  contests: It is merely authorized  to  screen multiple bidders for fitness; the  takeover contest will be determined by  the shareholders and the marketplace.  Second, the ICC is given a limited 90day window in which to conduct this  screening-not the 21h years that are  available  in mergers or acquisitions  within the railroad industry. Finally,  although the ICC should consider the  effect of a given proposal on employ ees, there is no statutory requirement  for  so-called  labor  protection  pay ments to displaced employees. In con trast to this moderate provision, cur rent law gives employees displaced by  a multicarrier merger or acquisition up  to 6 years of full pay, as a matter of  Federal law. I think these facts speak  for themselves: This is a very moder ate piece of legislation that leaves the  critical aspects of takeover contests in  the free market, while protecting the  public from the possible loss of critical  in our national  transportation  system.  One final note, Mr. Speaker. We are  likely to hear a good deal from certain  links  quarters about this takeover provision  rolling back the Staggers Act or rereg ulating the railroad industry. That is  flatly untrue. As one of the staunchest  defenders of the Staggers Act against  efforts to roll back the genuine im provements  in market-oriented  rate making, I know reregulation when I  see it. And in this case, the takeover  matter, we are dealing with provisions  of the Interstate Commerce Act whose  coverage was not affected one iota by  the Staggers Act. Instead, we are cor recting an anomaly in the statute that  was there long before 1980, but which  became all  too apparent within the  last year or so  as major  railroads  became the targets of noncarrier take over bids. So I ask that our Members  reaffirm their support for this meas ure, as they did last September by a  vote of 296  to 93, and continue  to  evaluate this bill on its merits, not on  the basis of slogans and rhetoric.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the  conference report.  0 1640  ",1990
447,727,7,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 7 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, the conference report  we have before us is a bill that the  committee has worked hard on, and I  certainly do not in any way want to in dicate that I am at all opposed to the  hard work and the efforts that they  put into this bill, but I do believe that  we need to focus on what we are about  to do here.  I  think it needs  to be understood  why some opposition to this bill is very  much in order. Let me state at the  outset, as I have tried to say on many  occasions on  the  floor, and  I have  found the debate deteriorated, I am  not opposed  to  railroads.  I  do not  think anybody should responsibly be  opposed to railroads in this country.  Railroads contribute a great deal  to  the economy of the country both in  terms of freight service and in terms  of passenger service, so I am not op posed to passenger rail service.  What I have begun to question very  seriously is whether or not Govern ment-subsidized  passenger  service  serves the best interests of this coun try. There are some who have come to  the floor today with a bill which they  say Government subsidies are the only  way that we can run passenger rail in  the country. I do not believe that to be  true.  I think it is important that we look  at other options as a way of dealing  with passenger rail for our future. I  also think it needs to be pointed out  that the administration is opposed to  this bill. The President would like to.  veto this bill, and I  think he has a  number of reasons that the member ship ought  to be  aware of before  coming to the floor and voting on a  ",1990
448,740,7,Mr. CARR.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  state emphatically at the outset that I  support family and medical leave. I do  not, however, support this rule, and  would ask my colleagues to oppose the  rule.  I do so, Mr. Speaker, because the  leadership of the Congress told us that  we would have an opportunity to vote  on a variety of approaches. Perhaps I  was a  little foolish  in believing that  that would actually be done, but I find  in this particular rule we are preclud ed from looking at and debating some  alternative approaches.  Mr. Speaker, we are straitjacketed in  this rule  to supporting either some  form of mandated benefits, where the  Congress of the United States is going  to substitute its judgment in literally  hundreds and millions of workplaces  across this country, or we are told we  can leave it and not do anything at all.  Well, there are some Members, Mr.  Speaker, who do not want to have a  choice of just some form of a mandate  or nothing at all.  We believe in parental leave. In my  own congressional office we practice  parental  leave. We give people  the  leave time they need to take care of  loved ones who are ill, or in the case  just  recently,  a  lady  in my office  became  pregnant  and  gave  birth,  thankfully a healthy baby, and we are  giving her that time off. We believe in  that.  We do not believe that the Congress  of the United States has the requisite  wisdom to impose its judgment in substitution for the wisdom of the work place.  Mr. Speaker, I had an amendment, a  substitute, which I asked the Commit tee on Rules to make in order, and  they declined, shutting me out and not  allowing Members of Congress to con sider my alternative. It may well not  have been accepted, but the Commit tee on Rules in its infinite wisdom de cided that we were not even to be al lowed to debate the issue or raise a  new idea.  Simply stated, Mr. Speaker, I believe  that Congress should lead the way.  Congress should tell businesses across  the country they ought to have a pa rental  leave policy, but they should  decide what that parental leave policy  ought to be.  To make sure that they are doing  what we are asking them to do, we  would ask  them to file a disclosure  statement simply stating what  their  policy is. Filing that disclosure state ment would also give us, Mr. Speaker,  a data base from which to move for ward future years if we find that busi nesses and workplaces are not taking  care of this essential need.  Mr. Speaker, I understand that the  current bill before us stems from stud ies done in two American cities, one in  South Carolina and one  in my own  home State  of Michigan. That  is  hardly  a  representative  sample  of  what is really going on in America on  parental leave.  The fundamental  fact  is  that the  Committee on Rules and the leader ship apparently felt somewhat threat ened by the idea of having other alter natives before the House as they had  promised us, and  they  recanted on  that promise, and now we are left with  a take it or leave it approach.  So many of us, Mr. Speaker, are  going to vote against this rule in pro test to the unfair and heavy-handed  way  that  the Committee on Rules  came to its conclusion, and will prob ably vote against the bill as well.  I  urge a vote against the bill.  Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York. Mr.  Speaker, for purpose of debate only, I  yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New York [Mr. GREEN].  ",1990

More  In reflecting that belief and the im portance of the family in the future of  our Nation, George Bush, in lliinois,  speaking  to a group of Republican  women in September 1988, said,  We need to assure that women don't have  to worry about getting their jobs back after  having a child or caring for a child during a  serious illness. That is what I mean when I  talk about a gentler nation.  Let me note that he used the word  assure. Unlike some of his advisers, he  did not say we should urge employers  to do it, he did not say we should hope  employers do it. Obviously urging em ployers will not assure that women or  male care providers in the family will  get their jobs back. The only way we  can do that is by legislation, and the  only way we can do that by legislation  is to adopt this rule and the bill that is  before us today. The President's advis ers should read his  lips and under stand that we need this bill to assure  that care providers are protected.  0 1820  There are some here who suggest  that we are creating some extraordi nary new precedent by this legislation.  I submit that that is not the case at  all, that in fact we have provided re employment mandates in past situa tions.  For example, the Jury Systems Im provement Act of 1978 provides  job  protection for employees who report  for Federal jury service. Many States  have  adopted  similar  legislation  to  protect those who are called for jury  service in the State courts. Under the  Federal veterans' reemployment rights  statute, draftees, reservists, and mem bers of the National Guard are provid ed  certain  employment  protections  while they are away on duty. Persons  inducted  into  or  enlisting  in  the  Armed Forces must be considered as  having been on furlough or leave of  absence during their military training  and. service. The law also prohibits ter mination because of any obligation as  a member of the Reserves.  In other words, Mr. Speaker,  the  idea of the right to return to one's job  after leave has ample precedent in our  Federal statutes. Let us build on that  precedent and extend that right to our  Nation's families, who are entrusted  with no less an important responsibil ity that nurturing the future genera tions of this country.  If we are going to do that, then we  must pass this rule today and we must  pass this bill tomorrow.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the bal ance of my time.  ",1990

454,753,7,Mrs. ROUKEMA.," Madam Chairman,  each  day,  hard-working Americans  lose their jobs because a family medi cal emergency requires that they take  time off to give temporary care to a se riously ill member of the family. It  may be a child dying of cancer who  needs a mother's loving care. It may  be a beloved parent who is terminally  ill and requires home care.  In a day and age when the majority  of American families need  two pay checks to get by,  it is  inconceivable  that we do not have a minimum guar antee of job security when a medical  emergency strikes. The debate over  the Family and Medical Leave Act is  not about mandates or benefit pack ages. It is about values and a standard  of decency  to protect  the  jobs  for  workers trying to capture a piece of  the American dream.  This week,  the House will vote on  compromise  legislation  that would  protect the jobs of working Americans  who must take short, unpaid leaves be cause of the birth of a child, the seri ous illness of a family member or their  own serious  illness. The Family and  Medical Leave Act would require com panies of 50 or more employees  to  allow  their  permanent workers  weeks of unpaid  leave per year for  12  birth of a baby, or serious family ill ness.  I speak as a Republican and also as a  woman who at one time chose to leave  my profession as a teacher to become  a full-time mother. It was a decision I  never  regretted. My years at home  with my children were  the happiest  and most rewarding years of my life. I  was fortunate to have the choice. Un fortunately, most women  today are  not in a position to make the same  choice. They are working because of  economic necessity.  LIPSERVICE  Members of both political parties  talk a good game and give lipservice to  family values but  turn  their backs  when a concrete proposal to give much  needed support  to working  families  comes forward.  COKPELLING CASE  An objective look at the facts pre sents a compelling case for a family  leave. Two-thirds  of women  today  have jobs outside the home because of  economic necessity. Job security for  both wage-earners is more crucial than  ever!  But  this  is only part of  the new  equation. Those over age 75 are the  fastest growing  segment of  society.  Americans  are healthier and  living  longer. But the reality is that an over whelming majority of  these elderly  will need the care of a family member  when serious  illness strikes. If they  cannot be cared for at home they will  require expensive nursing home treat ment which relatively few can afford.  These are not abstract problems.  Families are stressed and strained by  the competing demand of  jobs and  caring for family members. Families  are thrown into crisis when serious ill ness strikes. I know. I've been there.  When my son was stricken with lieu kemia and needed home care, I was  free to remain at home and give him  the living care he needed. But what of  the millons of mothers who work for  the thousands of companies that do  not have family leave policies?  Are we in Congress going to tell a  pregnant women or the mother of a  child dying of cancer to go find an other job? Why should we take a hard working, productive, taxpaying worker  who happens to have a medical crisis  and thrown them off the payroll? You  cannot deny that for many of them. It  may be just a short drop onto public  assistance.  LET'S SEPARATE FACE FROM FICEION  Is this a radical departure from the  traditions of American labor law? Not  at all.

I  these arti commend my colleagues to read  cles to gain a better appreciation of the Guard  and Reserve. Today I'm sharing another in the  series of articles that appeared in that April 30  Roll Call edition.  THI: TOTAL FoRCJ: POLICY  <By Stephen M. Duncan>  The Defense Department's policy to rely  heavily on National Guard and Reserve  units for fighting in any future conflicts,  known as the Total Force Polley, has re cently come under close scrutiny.  And examination of the policy is essential  if we are to ensure that fundamental deci sions about how we man the Armed Forces  rest on a general consensus.  Surprisingly, however, much of the par ticipation in the debate ls uninformed, or at  least insufficiently focused. An understand ing of the realities which affect the plan ning for the forces ls critical.  BALABCJ: IN TOTAL l'ORCJ: POLICY  Much of the recent discussion has cen tered on the lack of readiness of certain  Anny Reserve units.  Lost in the noise of the debate is the fact  that in addition to the Anny Reserve, the  Reserve components of the Armed Forces  consist of the Air National Guard, the Naval  Reserve,  the Marine Corps Reserve,  the  Anny National, the Air Force Reserve, and  in times of war, the Coast Guard Reserve.  For most missions and most units,  the  Total Force Policy has been very successful.  The policy was never  intended  to make  Active career soldiers and Reserve soldiers  fungible  items or mirror  images of each  other. Due to limited training and the con strained budgetary environment at the De fense Department,  it  ls unrealistic  to at tempt to make them equal.  Rather, the goal of the Total Force Polley  ls to integrate the capabilities and strengths  of Active and Reserve units  in the most  cost-effective manner, i.e., one that provides  the most total military capability within the  limitations of the budget.  In order to discuss the Total Force Polley  in a meaningful way, it is imperative that  broad generalities be avoided. Far too often  analysts frame the issue of the debate as  whether we are currently placing too much  reliance on Reserve Forces.  Some observers urge greater reliance on  Reserve Forces. Some urge greater reliance  on Reserves simply because part-time sol diers, sailors, airmen, and marines are gen erally less expensive. Others express doubts  about the current mix of Active and Reserve  personnel.  A balanced analysis of the Total Force  Polley must start with a focus on particular  missions. Some missions are ideal for Na tional Guardsmen and Reservists. Some are  clearly unsuitable.  Yet others can be reasonably assigned to  either Active or Reserve units.  ASSIGNING MISSIONS TO THE RESERVES  begins,  In deciding which wartime missions  to  assign  to Reserve Forces, planners must  start with assumptions about  the nature  and scope of the most likely future conflicts  and the  intentions and capability of the  most likely adversaries.  Planning for a general conflict in Europe  ls obviously different from planning in the  Persian Gulf, Korea, or other smaller areas.  Assumptions must also be made about the  amount of warning time the nation would  have before  actual  fighting  the  speed with which Reserve units could be  called to Active Duty and deployed to the  scene of the conflict, etc. These assumptions  are usually subjective and hardly fail-safe.  Force planners inevitably accept some risks.  Since  resources are  finite and  limited,  planners who assign resources for one kind  of conflict accept the risks inherent in not  assigning the same resource elsewhere.  Planners must also deal with the reality  that we simply cannot afford to maintain  Regular Armed Forces in sufficient numbers  to  fight all possible wars  in which  the  nation might become involved.  Americans have traditionally resisted ef fort.s to maintain a large, professional stand ing army  in peacetime. Once a  conflict  start.s, however, we must clearly be able to  generate enough force to bring it to a suc cessful conclusion.  Whether a particular mission should be  assigned to Reserve or to Active forces de pends generally upon the nature of the mis sion,  i.e.,  the specific military capability  that ls required.  Those in a position to make these deci sions must consider a broad range of factors,  such as the comparative costs of Active vs.  Reserve Forces; whether  the mission  re quires  forward-based  forces;  the urgency  with which the mission must be performed;  the availability of sufficient modem equip ment appropriate for the mission; the avail ability of sufficient fully trained personnel  with the military skills required; the exist ence of an adequate US sustaining base to  ensure  equitable overseas  tours  for  the  Active Forces; and other similar factors.  In determining whether to assign Active  or Reserve units, it is easy to overlook the  fact that the amount of training time re quired to perform some missions creates un acceptable pressures in the Reservists' civil ian workplaces.  But sometimes factors which enhance the  importance of Reserves are not taken into  account. Because of previous  service on  Active Duty, for example, many National  Guardsmen  and Reservists  bring much  greater experience to the performance of  particular missions than do Active soldiers  currently serving on Active Duty.  It ls widely recognized, for example, that  many Reservists and National Guardsmen  are among  the best  fighter, attack, and  transport pilots in the world.  MAKING RESERVISTS READY TO PERFORM  In recent months, certain readiness prob lems involving combat service support units  in the Anny have received public attention.  These units are responsible for mainte nance, medical, motor transport, and other  support functions. Although the units con stitute  some  70  percent of  the Anny's  combat  service  support  capability,  they  have not  received sufficient  resources  to  permit a state of readiness equal to most  Anny combat units.  Their readiness problems, however, are  not ""Reserve"" problems. They are ""Anny""  readiness . problems, and they say little or  nothing  about  the capabilities of other  Anny Reserve  units or Anny National  Guard units, much less about the capabili ties of the Reserve components of the other  services.  Logically, of course, there should be no  difference  between  the  types  of  forces  needed  to deter conflicts and  the forces  needed to win them. A potential adversary's  perception of his chances of succeeding in a  conflict  ls usually  related directly  to his  ardor  to being  in  it. Moreover, we can't  afford two types of forces, one devoted to  deterring war and one to winning it.  Readiness is one of the four ""pillars"" of  military capability;  the others are  force  structure, modernization of equipment, and  sustainability.  It includes tangible components, such as  leadership and morale. F1scal constraints  prevent the correction of many of the readi ness  challenges which  face  the Reserve  Forces.  Some readiness problems are the result of  factors which are unique to Reserve units,  such as limited training time, the geograph ic dispersion of  individual Reservists and  the fact that Americans generally and Re servists in particular are mobile.  Such challenges are usually not  insur mountable. A little common sense, some in novative thinking, and old-fashioned leader ship can go a long way to resolve them.  WHERE DO WE GO 1'ROll HERB?  As late as 1980,  the theory behind the  Total Force Policy had not been effectively  implemented.  By almost any standard, the condition of  the Reserve Forces was serious. A combina tion of austere procurement budgets during  the previous decade and de facto policy of  allocating almost all modem equipment to  the Active Forces had created both obsoles cence and a major shortage of equipment in  the Reserve Forces.  There was an urgent need for improve ments in the overall readiness and sustain ability of those forces.  Today, the circumstances of the Reserve  Forces are dramatically different. The in creased appropriations of the early 1980s  permitted  the  purchase  of  substantial  amounts of modem equipment for the Re serve components.  Improved training opportunities, the as sumption of important missions and respon sibilities,  and certain  incentive programs  have brought into the Reserve Forces the  highest quality personnel in their history.  There can be no doubt that across the  spectrum of military capabilities,  the Re serve Forces of the United States are the  best in the world.  The world, of course, changing.  Recent  developments  have  encouraged  our hopes for a prolonged period of peace.  President George Washington  reminded  our forefathers on several occasions, and  recent history had clearly demonstrated the  fact there ls nothing so likely to produce  peace as to be prepared to meet an enemy.  The challenge before us to be coldly real istic and balanced in our Judgments as we  seek to mold the strengths of our Active Na tional Guard, and Reserve soldiers, sailors,  airmen, and marines into a Total Force that  is capable of protecting the national securi ty interests of our nation during a period of  uncertainty and instability.

456,792,7,Mr. BOSCO.," Mr. Speaker, today I have in troduced  legislation which  I believe is crucial  to remedying a chronic problem affecting the  health and vitality of our Nation's air  traffic  control system. The Air Traffic Controller  In centive and Retention Act will attract and  retain qualified personnel to handle safely and  expeditiously the ever-increasing amount of air  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  traffic in our congested skies. My bill is aimed  at boosting system capacity through increased  productivity of the key component of the air  traffic control system:  the controllers  them selves.  It is time that we faced up to facts. The air  traffic control work force has not been rebuilt  to prestrike levels, especially in the number of  full performance level controllers [FPL's]. For  yet another year, the Federal Aviation Admin istration will  fall approximately 2,000 FPL's  short of the congressionally mandated level.  Under the FAA's pay demonstration project,  we have been  trying  to attract and  retain  qualified controllers at some of our most be sieged air traffic control facilities. However, in  order for this project  to succeed, controllers  must often be siphoned off from other busy  and strained facilities which have no control lers to spare. We only have so many fingers  or controllers to plug the holes in this leaking  dike, and we are running out of them.  In  spite  of  promises  to  provide  better  screening  and  education,  the  deplorable  washout percentage at the FAA's Oklahoma  City Academy shows no sign of declining.  More frightening still is the employment crisis  that looms ahead. Beginning  in 1995, almost  half of the controller work force will be eligible  to retire; there are few compelling reasons for  these controllers  to stay on. Sixty-thousand dollar annual salaries are  the exception, not  the rule. Younger controllers are resigning at  an alarming  rate. Last year, at the Oakland  Terminal Radar Approach Control, 17 FPL's  quit-more than a  third of  their actual FPL  work force.  Implementation of  the new National Air space Plan will require so-called bubble staff ing to handle training on new equipment and  concurrent operation of  the air  traff control  [ATC] system. The ATC system cannot shut  down while controllers  learn  to operate  this  new  technology.  And  the  so-called  labor  saving equipment of the NAS plan  is contin gent upon greater reliance on existing FAA  personnel.  The lessons of the past 9 years are clear.  While we have been fighting a series of pro tracted skirmishes at individual air traffic con trol facilities, we have been losing the overall  battle to provide safe and effective and traffic  control. We must be able to attract and retain  the  best  possible  people  throughout  the  Nation, not just at a few  locations.  I believe  my legislation will accomplish this goal by rais ing the controller pay differential from 5 to 15  percent, offering premium pay  for Saturday  work, and eliminating the age limitation on vol untary retirement for controllers with 20 years  of service.  I believe  that  this money would be well  spent. We are currently wasting millions of  dollars on ill-suited controller candidates who  fail at the academy or who cannot certify at  their air traffic control facilities. We are losing  to  retirement and  resignation, controllers  in  whom the Government has invested between  $100,000 and $200,000 and whose value  to  our safety and  the economy  is  inestimable.  This is unacceptable.  Half measures and public  relations cam paigns will no longer do. We must attract can didates who have the qualifications and apti tude  to make  it  through  the academy and  May 9, 1990  pass muster in  the air traffic control system.  We must ensure  that controllers stay  in  that  system as productive and active members  doing what they do best: separating aircraft.  We must build and sustain a vibrant work  force committed to excellence in order to in crease  the margin of safety and system ca pacity. That is exactly what my legislation will  do and  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.  I would like to thank the National Air Traffic  Controllers Association  for  their assistance  over the past months. Their observations and  expertise were most helpful and I look forward  to working with  them as well as  the entire  aviation community, and the U.S. flying public  to make this legislation a reality.  CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR  HEAD START JUSTIFIED  HON. DOUG BEREUTER  OF NEBRASKA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 9, 1990  ",1990
457,792,7,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, Head Start is  a favorite program among Members of Con gress, and for very good reason.  It is a pro gram that works! Studies of Head Start reveal  that children who participate  in  the program  do better in school, are less likely to drop out,  and make better social and emotional adjust ments to the learning environment.  Often times Members of Congress have to  sell big ticker items to their constituents, who  are concerned about the size of the Federal  deficit and the damage that deficit may do to  the  financial  security of  future generations.  The budget submitted by President Bush  re quested an increase of $500 million for Head  Start,  to a  record high  total of $1.9 billion.  There  is no question that whatever levels of  funding for Head Start Congri;iss approves will  be Federal dollars well spent.  This Members' constituents in Beatrice, NE  know about  this effective program as well.  Thanks  to  the  following  excellent editorial  from  the Beatrice Daily Sun,  this Member's  support of the Head Start Program at home is  made all the easier.  [From the Beatrice Daily Sun, May 4, 19901  LARGER HEAD START PROGRAM IMPORTANT  (By Kent Thomas)  Without any specific numbers to back me  up, I still believe that the large majority of  toddlers who attend and enjoy pre-school  will go on to become above-average students  and make a success of their lives.  Sure,  there will be exceptions,  for any  number of reasons, but I think the general ization is valid.  The  pre-school  experience  is  probably  more  important for children of disadvan taged families than others because it pro vides a learning opportunity that might not  otherwise be possible. Often, young people  in poverty-stricken or broken homes don't  get the chance to learn as much at home as  they should.  Which brings us to the Head Start pro gram, called by Helen Blank of the Chil dren's Defense Fund ""the most popular low income  program  because  of  its  unique  nature in addressing so many problems at  ",1990
458,805,7,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  the Oak land Press, a newspaper in my congressional  district, recently published a moving article by  Rachel Canaan-Kapen describing her family's  exp£:riences as Jews living in Lithuania.  Mrs. Kapen, a resident of West Bloomfield  Township, Ml, is the mother of Gilead Kapen,  the minority staff consultant to the Africa Sub comittee of the House Foreign Affairs Com mittee.  Mrs. Kapen expresses sadness at the de cline in the Jewish population of Lithuania and  concern for the future of those Jews still living  there. I commend her observations to my col leagues in the article which follows:  [From the Oakland Press]  LITHUANIA HAS RIGHT TO INDEPENDENCE, BUT  FATE OF REPUBLIC'S JEWS ls IN DOUBT  <By Rachel Canaan-Kapen)  The recent dramatic happenings unfold ing in the Republic of Lithuania evoke in  me, a Jew with close family ties to the land,  very conflicting emotions.

459,818,7,Mr. CLAY.," Madam Chairman,  I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin [Mr. MOODY].  ",1990
460,818,7,Mr. MOODY.," Madam Chairman, as  an economist, I just want to make two  brief points about this bill. One, it is  cost effective to pass this bill, and two,  it is not anticompetitive.  On cost effective, let me make this  point briefly: as long as there is a wel fare system in our country, and there  always will be, and thank goodness we  have a  safety net, as  long as  that  exists,  then someone on a very  low  income who  is working who has to  leave that job and be fired because  they want to take care of the first few  weeks of their child's new life, that  person may not get back to work for  quite a while.  We  all  know  that  the  longer  a  person is off work, the harder it is to  regain employment. So  that person,  yes, the employer may have the lack  of a mandate, so-called, but society  picks up an extra welfare bill. It is ex pensive to put people on welfare. That  balances very close for some people at  the low income level.  So we should do everything we can  to make sure people for whom welfare  is an alternative in fact have every in centive to stay on the job. So it is cost  effective from a budgetary point of  view.  No.  2,  competitiveness. Over  100  countries,  our  trading  competitors,  have this provision. In fact, many of  them  have  paid  family  leave,  not  unpaid, as this would be.  I  think  it  is a  slander on United  States business to say that our busi nesses need an extra margin, an extra  edge, in order to be competitive. I do  not believe that. I  think the United  States business can compete on the  same footing with Japan and Germa ny and Korea and France and England, all those countries that have this  provision. Why is it uncompetitive for  us to have it when our business in fact  is productive.  This is not anticompetitive. It puts  us on the same playing field and it is  humane for our own people. So on eco nomic grounds alone, not to mention  compassion  grounds,  pro-family  grounds,  this measure  should  be  passed.  ",1990
461,818,7,Mr. GRANDY.," Madam Chairman, I  yield myself 5 minutes.  Madam  Chairman,  as  we  begin  round two on the parental family and  medical leave debate this morning, let  me call to mind the words of our de parted  retired  colleague, Mr. Gene  Taylor of Missouri, who had a pretty  good way to assess the value of legisla tion. He had three criteria. One was  who does it really help;  two  is how  much does it really cost; and three, if  it  is  really necessary, how have we  gotten along without it for this long?  Let us begin with who  this really  helps. Well,  the gentlewoman  from  New Jersey [Mrs. RoUKEMA] has said  dual family incomes, and that is prob ably true. But can it be argued that it  helps single  family  income earners,  either single parents or parents with  one person earning income, or those  families with $11,000 or less annual  income?  Probably not, because  they are at  the  lower end of the spectrum and  cannot afford  to  take  that benefit.  These are not just my words. The New  York Times today in an editorial has  said as much.  Let me ask who it really helps in  terms of families, in terms of bonding.  Does this really help a young working  couple with kids older than newborns  who might be more concerned with  the first 10 years of life than the first  10 weeks, who might need additional  child care benefits over and above  what we are trying to do in H.R. 3? No,  because their ability to negotiate that  benefit will probably be proscribed by  this mandate.  Will it help that young child that  might have a congenital birth defect,  let us say kidney disease? Yes, sure, 12  weeks of unpaid leave is valuable, but  is it as good as extra medical coverage  that might pay for the dialysis ma chine or the transplant?  Who are we  really  trying  to help  here? Who is really going to take ad vantage of this legislation? How much  does it really cost? Five dollars per em ployee. Of course, that is up from $4  last year, and that is based only on the  cost of health care, which, by the way,  grows at 30 percent every year.  But that does not figure in the quad ruple damages which will be assessed  under this bill if you are found in vio lation. It does not figure in litigation.  It does not figure  in the retraining  costs, the costs of going out and re",1990
462,831,7,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Madam Chairman,  today  the House of Representatives considered and  passed H.R. 770,  the Family and Medical  Leave Act. I did not support this legislation be cause I am truly concerned about the practi cality of Government involvement in this issue.  I believe it would be extremely difficult to draft  a logical law that takes into account the com plex needs of working people across  the  country. The kind of leave that is needed and  appropriate will vary from situation to situation.  I voted against this bill because I believe that  it precludes the ability of employers to work  out suitable arrangements  in special circum stances  involving  family sickness and other  health and maternity situations.  The Federal Government  traditionally has  not  imposed particular benefit packages on  employers and employees, and it should not  begin now. The kinds of benefits that a firm  provides to its employees should continue to  be decided by negotiations between labor and  management-not mandated by the Govern ment. No kind of mandated national benefit  can  take  into account  the unique circum stances that individual businesses face. This  bill goes against the current trend to flexible  benefits such as cafeteria plans and forces all  employees to accept benefits that they may  neither want nor need.  Coming from a small business background  myself, I understand that each special circum stance determines what amount of leave  is  appropriate, whether it be 4, 8 or 12 weeks.  Businesses large and small need the flexibility  to work with  their employees to provide the  type of benefit package that helps them most.  If we come in and mandate one lone piece of  the employee benefits pie, who is to say that  the other  fringe benefits  that make up  the  package aren't more important to employees?  Employers may have workers who prefer flex time,  dental  insurance, more  vacation,  or  other benefits. These employers and employ ees both will suffer without  the  flexibility  to  decide what is best for them.  This  year,  Congress  is  considering  a  number of mandates which will affect the av erage business in this country, many of which  I support. New minimum wage  standards,  which  I  fully supported, went  into effect  in  April. The Americans with Disabilities Act,  which I also support, will soon be considered  here  in  the House. That  law  requires  that  companies provide employment opportunity  and equal access to the disabled. The Civil  Rights Act of 1990, currently being considered  in the House Judiciary Committee, and which I  have cosponsored, strengthens the laws pro hibiting employment discrimination. In addition,  I expect  that  legislation providing minimum  health  benefits  for  all workers will  also  become a reality in the near future.  But the Government should mandate on the  business  sector  only  those  requirements  which cannot feasibly and sensibly be handled  between employers and employees in a nego tiated  context. While  the  reasons  for  the  family and medical  leave bill are very  real  indeed, the bill creates more problems than it  solves.  ",1990
463,831,7,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Chairman,  today  the  House of Representatives has a historic op portunity to help American families. By pass ing the Family and Medical Leave Act we are  recognizing  the  relationship between  family  obligations and professional responsibilities.  This is a vote for the American family, an in stitution that has come under hard times lately  and  truly needs and deserves  this kind of  boost.  The substitute that will be offered by Repre sentatives GORDON and WELDON presents a  generous compromise that both protects the  leave provisions of the bill and takes into con sideration the concerns raised by the business  community.  As someone who has spent many years ad vocating the strengthening of our foster care  and child welfare systems,  I strongly support  this bill. At a time when American families are  breaking apart because of drug use, divorce,  and child abuse,  this legislation eases some  of  the conflicts and burdens many  families  face.  The provisions of this bill are especially criti cal to adoptive and foster families. Presently,  there are over 31,000 children in the United  States waiting to be adopted; some 240,000  children are presently  living  in  family-foster care situations. These children and their adop tive or foster parents need time to bond and  become a family.  A  large portion of these children  living  in  foster care are older and have been the vic tims of sexual or physical abuse. Adjusting to  a new family is not easy, but being able to  take time off from a job to bond with a new  child can help ease the transition.  Caring for a new family member can be tre mendously stressful. By denying parents the  opportunity to take a short leave to get their  family  together, we compound  this stress.  Imagine the conflicts a new parent must ad dress if they have to choose between getting  to know their newly-adopted child, who is ex periencing  emotional  trauma  after  being  placed in the home, and keeping the job that  allows the parent to put food on the table, to  clothe, and to protect that youth.  We cannot, and should not, continue to ask  parents to choose between earning a living or  fulfilling their obligations to their families.  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of  the Gordon-Weldon substitute. American fami lies are depending upon us.  ",1990
464,831,7,Mr. SYNAR.," Madam Chairman, today I rise  in support of the Family and Medical Leave  Act because it strikes the proper balance be tween family and work responsibilities. The bill  provides employees with 12 weeks a year in  unpaid  family and/ or medical  leave and ex empts businesses with under 50 employees.  Years ago, when fathers worked and moth ers stayed home, there was no question about  how to care for a sick relative or a newly born  child. Today, 57 percent of married mothers  ",1990

472,870,7,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, we are facing two  serious long-term crises that we must begin to  address-global warming and the budget defi cit. The good news is that there is one solu tion  to achieving  the twin goals of reducing  global warming and  the budget deficit.  It  is  market-oriented and it works. The solution is a  carbon tax.  The problem of the budget deficit is well known and unquestioned. Headlines are filled  with talk of budget summits and the need to  raise billions of dollars to avoid massive dis ruptions in Government services. The amount  of money needed  to stave off dire conse quences mounts  relentlessly. Virtually every  number dealing with the predicted size of the  deficit has been underestimated.  Let's tum to global warming. Virtually every  serious climate scientist says we need to act  immediately  to  reduce carbon dioxide emis sions. The major conclusion from 300 scien tists and policy makers from 46 countries and  the United Nations at the World Conference,  Toronto, canada, June 1988 was ""Humanity  is  conducting  an  unintended,  uncontrolled,  globally pervasive experiment whose ultimate  consequences could be  second only  to a  global nuclear war. Far-reaching impacts will  be caused by global warming and sea-level  rise, which are becoming increasingly evident  as a result of continued growth in atmospheric  concentrations of carbon dioxide and other  greenhouse gases.  It  is  imperative  to act  now.""  Agreeing with this call to action is the Inter parliamentary Conference on the Global Envi ronment  in  their May 2, 1990, declaration.  Representing  42  countries,  they  issued  a  series of declarations, including calling for re ductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 50  percent from 1990 levels  in  the year 2010.  November  7,  1989,  President  Bush  an nounced that ""the United States has agreed  with other industrialized nations that stabiliza tion of carbon dioxide emissions should be  achieved as soon as possible."" The Group of  7 Summit July 16, 1989, said,  ""We strongly  advocate common efforts to limit emissions of  carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,  which threaten to induce climate change, endangering the environment and ultimately the  economy.  Mr. Speaker, heeding these calls to action, I  am introducing a carbon tax. A carbon tax is  an effective market-oriented tool that will ben efit both  the environment and the economy.  My tax on chlorofluorocarbons [CFC's], which  became law on January 1, 1990, has clearly  led to a change in CFC use and has dramati cally increased recycling of CFC's. In addition,  it is contributing billions of dollars to the U.S.  Treasury. A carbon tax could have the same  positive effect on reducing carbon emissions  while simultaneously reducing the deficit.  Advocates of a market-based approach are  many. Professor of Economics at Yale Univer sity William Nordhaus said in the March/ April  issue of EPA Journal ""Consumption of fossil  fuels has many negative spillovers besides the  greenhouse effect, such as  local pollution,  traffic congestion, and so forth. In addition to  slowing global warming, carbon  taxes would  restrain  the consumption of fossil  fuels, en courage R&D on nonfossil fuels like methane,  lower oil imports, reduce the trade and budget  deficits, and  raise  the national saving rate.""  The Economic Report of the President, Febru ary 1990, says ""a fee or a tradeable allow ances scheme would  lead  firms and  individ uals to consider the social cost of greenhouse  emissions in their private decisions. Because  market-based  approaches  are  flexible  and  provide incentives that affect decisions at all  points  along  the  production-consumption  chain and across all industries, they automati cally  focus on  those activities where emis sions reductions can be achieved at the least  cost.''  Industry segments have expressed strong  support for a carbon tax. Helen 0. Petrauskas,  vice president for environment and safety en gineering at Ford Motor Co., appearing before  a Senate subcommittee on April 4, 1990, testi fied ""* * * Government should also consider  a  'greenhouse' or carbon  fee that might be  applied  to all  fuels  that emit carbon dioxide  when burned * * * at whatever source."" At  the same hearing Dr. Marina Whitman, vice  president at General Motors, said, ""Wouldn't it  make better sense  to create  incentives  to  induce all emitting sources  to  reduce  their  emissions rather than focus attention virtually  exclusively on one particular activity  in  re sponding to the concern about global warm ing? Because ~ is a byproduct of all types  of fossil fuel combustion, wouldn't a fee struc ture tied to the level of carbon content of vari ous fossil fuels be the fairer approach, as well  as more effective?""  President Bush, speaking before the  Inter governmental Panel on Climate Change on  February 5, 1990, challenged ""As we work to  create policy and agreements on action, we  want  to encourage  the most creative ap proaches. Wherever possible, we believe that  market mechanisms should be applied-and  that our policies must be consistent with eco nomic growth and free market principles in all  countries."" The carbon  tax meets  the chal lenge of a free market approach. The burning  of carbon currently does not pay its societal  cost. The tax will ensure that it does.  Mr. Speaker, the carbon tax that I am intro ducing today is modest in its effort to address  carbon dioxide emissions. The tax will bring  about a substantial reduction in growth of U.S.  carbon dioxide emissions over  the next 1 O  years. The tax is the equivalent of putting a  $25 a ton charge on carbon in fuels.  The carbon tax will be phased in over a 5year period. The tax on coal will be $3 per ton  starting in 1991, rising  to $15 by 1995. The  tax on petroleum will start at $.65 per barrel  rising to $3.25. For natural gas, the tax starts  at $.08 per MCF rising to $.40 when phased  in.  The amount of money raised by the carbon  tax is $6 billion in the first year. The carbon  tax will  rise by approximately $6 billion per  year, contributing more  than $30 billion per  year to deficit reduction when fully implement ed.  Mr. Speaker, as the global military threats  fade, we must focus on  the  two things that  threaten our national security-environmental  destruction and the budget deficit. There is no  doubt .that a carbon tax can lead the charge in  attacking the heart of both of those problems.  CONGRESSMAN  ANNUNZIO  SA LUTES NATION'S POLICE OFFI CERS  ",1990

474,870,7,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise to call  to the attention of my colleagues in the House  of Representatives that the week of May 13  through 19 will be observed as National Police  Week, and I would like to take this opportunity  to pay tribute to the law enforcement officers  across our Nation who protect our children  and our families and keep our cities and our  country safe.  Once a year it is quite fitting for us to recog nize these public servants who daily put their  lives on  the  line  to protect us  from  theft,  murder, and drug-related crimes which have  afflicted our Nation. Their efforts are often  taken  for granted and  go  unnoticed,  and  therefore  the celebration of ""National Police  Week"" gives our country a chance  to say  ""thank you.""  In 1984 when  I became chairman of the  House Administration Committee, one of my  first actions was to move for swift passage of  legislation to build the National Law Enforce ment Officers Memorial. This memorial, which  is now being built solely with private contribu tions  from about one-half million  individuals  and 200 corporations, is testimony to the re spect and admiration our society has for our  law enforcement officers, who are at the front  line of protecting our homes and our families.  This memorial, which is being constructed at  Judiciary Square, is expected to be completed  in the spring of 1991 and is a stirring tribute to  the men and women who have made the ulti mate sacrifice for our safety.  March 15 is also  the 75th anniversary of  Peace Officers Memorial Day. Signed  into  public law by President Kennedy on October  1, 1962,  this  legislation pays  tribute  to  the  Federal, State, and municipal officers who  have been killed or disabled  in  the  line of  duty, and recognizes the tremendous service  and sacrifice given by  the brave men and  ",1990
475,896,7,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President, I want  to call my colleagues' attention to a  matter which I believe is of great importance. That has to do with some  key Judgments that have been recently filed with the Senate Intelligence  Committee as a result of an investigation conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency. Last year, during the  markup of the intelligence authorization portion of the Defense bill, I included an amendment which required  DIA to conduct an analysis of the security programs that are currently in  place for several of our DOD research,  development,  testing, and evaluation  centers in this country.  The DIA has done an outstanding  Job, and I want to take this opportuniRECORD.  There being no objection, the Key  Judgments from the report were or dered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  KEY JUDGMENTS  <U> The following conclusions are based  on a survey of the test sites at Vandenberg  Air Force Base, California, Cape Canaveral  Air Force Station, Florida, and White Sands  Missile Range, New Mexico, and discussions  ",1990
476,909,7,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President,  the  eventual fate of this bill, S. 135, on  which we  have expended  so much  effort in these last few days. remains  unknown to us. I believe that it will  pass the Senate. and that it will short ly be on the President's desk. What  happens after that is anyone's guess.  There may well be sufficient votes in  this body  to override a Presidential  veto. and then again there may not. So  not a one of us knows right now.  Therefore, I believe we have to pro ceed on that basis-we must assume both proponents and opponents of this  legislation-that  it will become  law.  and do everything we can to make it  the best law possible. As I have repeat edly said,  I  take my colleague from  Ohio at his world when he says that  there is no intention here to ""unlock  the floodgates"" of politicization of our  Federal agencies. I know that the det rimental effects which  I  fear may  result from the passage of this legisla tion are exactly what he has said he  does not want-""everybody dunning  everybody  else within  a  particular  union or employee organization  for  money.'' I should say also that I be lieve that there are some people out  there who want precisely that. howev er.  In sum, I believe that once this legis lation-or any  legislation-is passed,  many of  the good  intentions of  its  sponsors will go right out the window.  and that there will always be someone  out there bending with a magnifying  glass over the bill,  looking for loop holes, or imprecise language. Not ev eryone.  but  someone.  There will  always be someone. So I hope that if  this bill does pass, we will have tight ened up  its provisions  to  the point  where  it stands  the best chance of  achieving its stated objectives. Some  pretty  good  bills,  and  some  that  seemed exquisitely clear to the legisla tures  that passed  them. have been  twisted beyond recognition in their ap plication.  That is  the problem at which my  amendment is aimed. This language in  the bill concerning ""Federal employee  organizations"" concerns me. It is my  understanding that the intention here  is for members of an employee union  to be able to be designated as ""solici tors"" for the union PAC-and should  only be permitted to solicit from other  members of the union, and only off duty at that. I have expressed my con cerns about  that already.  I do not  think we  should be expanding that  type of partisan politicking in the Fed eral work force. But my amendment  accepts that intent and clarifies it by  making a technical change to the lan guage so that it will be more consist ent with existing law. It would change  the term ""Federal employee organiza tion"" to ""Federal employee labor orga nization, as defined by section 7103(4)  of this title"" -in this case. title 5 of  the United States Code.  I understand  that Senator GLENN  did not  invent  that  lovely phrase ""Federal employee organization.'' On  Monday we heard that OPM had in vented it. However, the OPM has in formed me that there is no clear defi nition in the law for the term ""Federal  employee organization"" which would  properly define the scope of this bill.  That  is what concerns me. We all  know around here how the law works.  Without such an amendment. a chal lenge  to this  law could someday be  brought before a judge here in Wash ington or out in Alaska somewhere.  That judge might decide that ""Federal  employee organization"" means some thing else entirely-that it applies to  the entire Federal agency, or the em ployee credit union, or the office soft ball  team. Sometimes a  law has a  funny way of taking on a  life of its  own in this country. To a lot of people,  what we  intended does not matter only what  they can get away with  under the wording of the law matters.  I believe that our chances of achieving  the intentions of this bill will be maxi mized if we employ the statutory lan guage of  the section of  the United  States Code which covers labor-man agement relations. This is  the same  section  of  the  law which Senator  GLENN  cited  extensively  yesterday  morning during the debate concerning  the amendment of Senator McCON NELL. If we clarify our intent under  section 7323 of this bill, I expect that  we will avoid a lot of tomfoolery.  My amendment utilizes  the  term  ""Federal labor organization"" which is  clearly defined under  existing  law.  However, I have found that there are  some Federal employee organizations  which do not have as their purposes  ""dealing with an agency concerning  grievances and conditions of employ ment     ... as defined under 5 U.S.C.  7103<4>. These groups,  such as  the  Postal Supervisors and  the Federal  Managers Association.  do  however  have PA C's. Therefore I am also in cluding in my amendment a grandfa ther clause which will permit  these  groups to conduct the type of political  activity authorized under this section.  This will apply only to such groups  that have PAC's in existence at the  time of the enactment of these Hatch  Act reform amendments. That should  cover all of the bases nicely. and still  prevent any tentacles of this statute  from reaching areas where they are  not intended to be.  President,  I  stress  that my  amendment is purely in the nature of  Mr.  a clarification and does not attempt to  alter the substance of the bill. I hope  that it can be adopted by unanimous  consent.  In summary,  this amendment uti lizes the term ""Federal labor organiza tion,'' which is clearly defined under  existing law. I found there are some  Federal employee organizations which  do not have as their purpose ""dealing  with an agency concerning grievances  and conditions of employment.'' I have  presented  this  amendment with  a  grandfather clause which will permit  any groups that are not in that to con duct  the  type  of  political  activity  which they do now. This will apply to  only such groups that have PAC's in  existence at the time of the enactment  of  these Hatch Act  reform amend ments.  I have visited with Senator GLENN  about this and I think it is acceptable,  and with Senator RoTH.  ",1990

493,948,7,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President, I  rise today to off er legislation to main tain the free flow of commerce on the  Missouri River. The importance of un obstructed commerce along the Mis souri River  is such that a Missouri  River  riverboat  is  included  in  the  Kansas State seal.  Yesterday a Federal judge issued an  injunction  which  effectively  render the Missouri River unnavigable  to commercial river traffic. The enor mity of this decision cannot be under stated. Grain  prices  have  already  begun to fall in reaction to the loss of  this efficient form of transportation.  Loss of the river will be higher trans portation costs to bulk shippers. Who  pays the cost of higher shipper costs?  It will come out of the pockets of  farmers and consumers.  Long before the Louisiana Purchase,  the Missouri River has served as one  of the major arteries in our national  transportation system. We all have an  interest in maintaining the free flow  of commerce along the Missouri River.  Our national  transportation require ments should not be circumvented for  local or parochial interests.  Since  colonial  times  the Federal  Government has taken action to pro tect the free flow of commerce in navi gable waterways. These waterways are  precious national assets. I believe the  Federal Government must continue its  role of protecting navigable waterways  and must reverse the precedent of this  injunction. Time is of the essence and  the failure  to act swiftly will be an  economic disaster. Within an hour of  the  court's  injunction  the  flow  of  water into the Missouri River was sub stantially  restricted.  Towboats  are  hurrying to move barges downstream.  By Sunday the waterway could be un navigable above Kansas City.  Mr. President, if we are going to be  competitive in an increasing interna tional economy we must protect the  unrestricted  flow of  interstate com merce. At a time when Europe is rec ognizing the value of removing bar riers to interstate commerce decisions  such as this injunction establish new  barriers  to our  interstate commerce  and handicap the ability of our indus tries and  farmers  to compete  in a  global market.  This bill simply provides for the con tinued maintenance of navigable levels  of water along the Missouri River to  protect the free flow of commerce and  look forward to working for its swift  enactment.e  I  ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS  s. 9  At  the  request of Mr. DOLE,  the  name of the Senator from Maine CMr.  COHEN] was added as a cosponsor of S.  9, a bill to amend title II of the Social  Security Act to phase out the earnings  test over a 5-year period for individ uals who have attained retirement age,  and for other purposes.  s. 501  At the request of Mr. D' AKA.To, the  name of the Senator from Delaware  CMr. BIDEN] was added as a cosponsor  of S. 501, a bill to amend the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 to make perma nent, and to increase the amount of,  the exclusion  for  amounts  received  under qualified group  legal services  plans.  s. 1687  At the request of ",1990

495,961,7,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. Presi dent, I would like to take a moment to  recognize  the  outstanding  achieve ments of Carrol Henderson, who devel oped  the Minnesota Department of  Natural Resources' Non-game Wildlife  Program. Under his guidance, this pro gram has become into one of this Na tion's model non-game wildlife pro grams. On May 16, 1990, Mr. Hender son will receive the Chevron Conserva tion Award as one of the Nation's top  10 conservationists.  When Minnesota's Non-game Wild life Program was established in 1977,  it was given no money. It was up to  Carrol Henderson,  its first and only  supervisor, to create the program out  of nothing but an idea to protect Min nesota's wildlife. In 1980, the ""chicka dee checkoff"" was added to Minneso ta's tax forms. This allowed citizens to  designate  $1  or more  from  their  income  for  nongame  purposes.  Today, Henderson supervises a pro gram with a budget of $1.2 million and  staff of six.  When Carrol Henderson began  to  build Minnesota's Non-game Wildlife  Program, the wildlife protection move ment was  Just  beginning  in  this  Nation. Today, Minnesota's program  serves as a model  for other States.  This is a tribute to Carrol's dedication  and devotion to his life-long concern  for all wildlife. Mr. President, Carrol  was profiled recently in the Saint Paul  Pioneer Press and I ask that this arti cle be printed in the RECORD at the  conclusion of my remarks. Everyone  should know about the person behind  Minnesota's Non-game Wildlife Pro gram and its success.  The article follows:  tax  NoN-GAJD: WILDLD'E CBID' RIGHT MAN AT  RIGHT Tno:  .

I've always been more interested  in providing long-term benefits to wildlife,""  said Henderson, the energetic and innova tive supervisor of  the Minnesota Natural  Resources Department's non-game wildlife  program.  The program, which  is concerned with  conservation of feathered friends and furry  creatures not sought by hunters, was cre ated in 1977 with no legislative funding and  Henderson as supervisor. In reality, there  was no program; it was up to Henderson to  create one.  Three years later, Minnesota became the  third state to fund non-game wildlife pro grams by allowing citizens to designate $1 or  more from their income tax for non-game  purposes, a procedure that quickly became  known as ""the chickadee checkoff.""  Today, the non-game program has a $1.2  million budget and a regional staff of six. In  all, a dozen people are working on non-game  wildlife programs in Minnesota. The Minne sota non-gar-~ wildlife program has become  a model for ""ther states. Thirty-four states  now have sim.llar programs and funding.  On May 16, Henderson will  travel  to  Washington, D.C.,  to receive the Chevron  Conservation Award for  the programs he  developed over the 13 years he has headed  the Minnesota program.. The award, which  originated 36 years ago, is presented annual ly by Chevron Corp. to the nation's top 10  conservationists.  Henderson, 43 traces his interest in wild life and conservation to his youth on a 132acre farm near Zearing, Iowa, a community  of 500 some 25 miles northeast of Ames. He  recalled how his father pointed out bird  nests in the field, how he helped his grand father build bird houses and how he and his  five siblings received nature guides and bird  books as presents.  As he grew up, Henderson became inter ested in other wildlife activities,  including  trapping, which  provided  pocket money  during his  teen-age  years.  ""Trapping  is  looked down on by people today, but while I  was growing up,  trapping was one of the  avenues by which I became interested in  helping wildlife as a adult,"" he said.  KNOWN AS A DOER  If Henderson has a reputation, it is as a  doer, and it was undoubtedly honed in high  school. He was on the track team, was a so loist  in musical groups, played the  tenor  saxophone and clarinet, and was editor of  the yearbook and newspaper. He also was  class  valedictorian-a  class,  he  quickly  added, that numbered only 44.  It was on to the University of Iowa then  for a degree  in zoology and a minor  in  botany, and a growing interest in wildlife  conservation as a career. The next stop was  the University of Georgia and  a  broad  three-year program that led to a master's  degree  in  forest  resources,  although his  course of study was broader than just for estry.  His work at the University of Georgia in cluded five months of studying Costa Rican  wildlife. It was in Costa Rica that he met  his wife, Ethelle. They have a, 17-year-old  son, Craig, who is a  junior at Blaine High  School.  Degree in hand, Henderson spent three  years in the Air Force as a communications  maintenance officer. When he was stationed  at Biloxi, Miss., and Altus, Okla., he taught  evening classes on natural resource conser vation at local universities.  Out of the Air Force and unemployed,  Henderson was offered a job as an environ mental consultant to measure the impact a  Georgia highway project would have on fish  and wildlife. The highway was not built.  1974,  Henderson  left Georgia  to  become assistant manager of the Lac Qui  Parle Wildlife Area in western Minnesota  and established his affinity for placing job  satisfaction bet ore cash. ""I left a job paying  $15,000 a year to take one that paid $10,000  a year. The company I was with offered to  cut my salary so I could stay in Georgia,"" he  recalled with a grin.  For the next three years, he was involved  in game law enforcement, wildlife surveys,  restoration projects, building  fences  and  myriad other activities. ""It seemed like no  two days were the same,"" Henderson said.  It seems Henderson was the right man at  the right place at the right time with the  right education and experience when the  In  It  non-game wildlife program. was established.  Creating the program., Henderson said, was  an acknowledgement of broad public inter est in all species of wildlife.  ""I think the public now wants to be look ing out for all species,"" he said, adding that  concern for non-game species stems in part  from concern for endangered creatures, and  the impact various things have on wildlife.  ""If you have a good non-game program., it  becomes a preventative program. that pre vents  species  from becoming endangered  . . . it is proactive and not a reactive ap proach.  is  like preventive medicine.  I  think people can relate to that,'' said Hen derson, who is former president of the Non game Wildlife Association of North Amer ica.  During the three years when there was no  legislative  funding,  Henderson  surveyed  non-game wildlife with the help of volun teers, issued status reports, gave speeches to  various groups ""and quickly learned the im portance of grassroots support.""  When the Legislature created the ""chicka dee checkoff,'' Henderson said, ""it created  an  instant opportunity for a  tremendous  amount of progress in non-game conserva tion.""  SUPPORT IS EVmDrr  He cites a survey by the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service when he argues there  is  ""enormous public support""  for non-game  wildlife, such as songbirds, in Minnesota. ""A  total of $237 million was spent in 1985 in  Minnesota alone on wildlife photography,  birdwatching, bird feeding and wildlife re lated tourism. In that same year, $217 mil lion w:as spent on hunting-related recrea tion,'' he said.  His reputation as a doer serves Henderson  well when he admits it is at times difficult  to determine where his work ends and his  pleasure begins.  For example, he still gives at least one  speech a week. Yet he has found time to  write two books about his hobbies, ""Land scaping for Wildlife,'' which explains what  to plant to attract wildlife to your land, and  ""Woodworking for Wildlife,'' which details  how to construct various wildlife structures.  The landscape book sold more than 25,000  copies the first year. The woodworking book  has sold more than 50,000 copies. Henderson  does not receive any royalties.  Wildlife photography also  is among his  avocations, and for the past six years Hen derson has led groups on wildlife photo and  birdwatching tours to Costa Rica. He also is  an avid hunter and a taxidermist, and nu merous birds he has mounted are displayed  in his work cubicle and elsewhere in the  DNR headquarters building at 500 Lafay ette Road, St. Paul. In addition, he main tains a bluebird trail with 25 birdhouses in  Anoka County.  Henderson admits his program.  is small  compared with other state programs, and he  acknowledges he cannot do everything he  would like to help wildlife. But he sees that  as an opportunity or ""a conduit  to get  others involved, either through fundraising  or volunteering.""  ABOUT CARROL HENDERSON  Age: 43.  Home: Blaine.

496,974,7,Mr. DONNELLY.," Mr. Speaker, the Subcom mittee on Select Revenue Measures of  the  Committee on Ways and Means is currently in  the process of considering modifications  to  the tax treatment of life insurance companies.  At issue is a true measure of a life insurance  company's  income  for purposes of imposing  the Federal income tax.  As a member of that Subcommittee, I have  been closely  involved  in  this process, and  I  have been paying close attention to potential ly disturbing trends in the industry. Clearly, our  Subcommittee has two obligations during our  deliberations: the first is to enact sound, legiti mate  income  tax policy. The  second  is  to  insure that life insurance company policyhold ers are protected.  To that end,  I would like to have printed in  the RECORD an article from the July 10, 1989  issue of Forbes magazine entitled  ""You Bet  Your Life."" The article points out that all may  not be well in the life insurance industry, and  highlights some disturbing trends that all of us  should be aware of during  this debate. We  should be cautioned by  the debacle  in  the  savings and  loan  industry and  further cau tioned by  the  fact  that  the Federal Govern ment has no protection available to life insur ance company policyholders who lose their in vestment if the company through which  they  own their policy goes bankrupt.  Perhaps the time has come for greater Fed eral regulation of the insurance industry gen erally. Certainly,  the Federal  tax  laws are an  appropriate place to start. Nonetheless, I think  that the Forbes article bears close attention,  and I urge my colleagues to study it carefully.  [From Forbes Magazine, July 10, 1989]  You BET YOUR LIFE  <By Gretchen Morgenson>  Of the 155 million Americans who own  some form of life insurance, few are fully  aware of  the  industry's eroding  financial  base and its rising rate of failures. This ig norance  is not bliss. Unlike customers at  banks and  savings and  loan  institutions,  people who trust their money to life insur ance companies are not protected by a fed eral bailout mechanism.  No, we're not predicting massive failures  among  life companies, as happened with  savings and loans and,  to a  lesser extent,  commercial  banks. But only  an  ostrich  would ignore signs of a seriously deteriorat ing situation.  ""The freewheeling approach of some  in  the insurance industry may put these com panies on a crash course similar to the route  taken by many of our nation's S&L's,"" says  Thomas Wheeler, chief executive of Massa chusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., the nation's 11th-largest life insurer. Mass Mutual  is widely  regarded as one of  the sounder  companies, and Wheeler is referring to life  companies that have been taking excessive  risks in their investment portfolios.  Life insurance isn't supposed to be a risky  business. But since 1987 some two dozen life  insurance companies have defaulted. This  marks a sharp departure from the previous  two decades, when the failure rate was run ning at about one life insurer per year.  So far, the failed companies have been rel atively small. The annual bailout costs have  jumped from less than $9 milion in 1982 to  about $70 million on average in the past two  years. Most of the losses  to policyholders  have been made good by healthy insurance  outfits under various state guaranty fund  systems. But if the failures mount, this pro  bono publico policy will give way to simple  self-preservation.  If the problems were  limited  to a  few  highfliers, they could be fairly easily con tained. Unfortunately,  they are not. The  same high-risk strategies and  investments  that forced some small insurers into insol vency are now nagging some of  the big name life companies like Equitable Life As surance Society, Travelers  Insurance and  I.C.H. Corp. Across  the  industry, balance  sheets have weakened dramatically. Five  years ago all the life insurance companies  followed by the rating agencies were rated  Aaa; today only 40% have that top rating,  according to Moody's Investors Service.  What are the trouble signs? Perhaps the  most alarming is shrinking capital and sur plus accounts, which are meant to cushion  against unforeseen risk. One key measure  compares capital with portfolio risk. Using  100 as an adequate level of capital needed to  compensate for portfolio risk, an index com piled by Moody's shows a steady decline,  from 110  four years ago  to 96  today see  chart, opposite).  Another dicey development  is  the  fact  that more and more mutual life insurers are  being  forced  to  reduce dividends paid  to  their policy holders-a clear indication of a  profit squeeze. Last year Mutual of New  York, with $24 billion in assets, reduced its  dividend by 3.5%. Manufacturers Life Insur ance Co., with $19.9 billion in assets has cuts  its rates 4.3% over the past two years.  It is hardly reassuring to note that many  insurance companies are starting to employ  questionable accounting  techniques to  im prove the look of their net capital positions.  Late last year, for example, two large life in surers  entered  into unusual  transactions  with Citibank. General American Life Insur ance Co. of St. Louis ($5.1 billion, assets)  and Washington National Insurance of Ev anston,  Ill.  ($1.9 billion, assets> sold Citi bank future premiums worth $75 million  and $30 million,  respectively. These sales  had the effect of boosting both companies'  net capital positions because  the  insurers  immediately booked as assets the $75 mil lion and $30 million they received from Citi bank. But what  the bookkeeping entries  didn't show was  that both  insurers had  mortgaged some of their future cash flow.  Indeed, a few months ago the New York  State  superintendent of  insurance  ruled  Forum  Insurance  that the sale of future premiums is really a  loan, and so an amount equal to the premi um sale should appear as a liability on the  insurer's balance sheet. The superintendent  found the Citibank deals ""inconsistent with  statutory accounting principles."" But  the  sales have not been officially disallowed, nor  have the insurers restated their financials.  These transactions are nothing more than  an effort to mask capital depletions. With out them, Washington National would have  shown a $13 million statutory loss in capital  for 1988, and General American would have  had a $4 million decrease.  The stakes are mounting. The amount of  money that changed hands in these transac tions was relatively small. But word has it  that similar premium sales are being consid ered by two industry giants. Equitable Life  Assurance Society and  the Massachusetts  Indemnity & Life Insurance Co., a subsidi ary of A.L. Williams. Warns Joseph Belth,  editor  of  newsletter,  ""When these guys begin to play games like  this, you may be getting closer to a disas ter.""  What's behind the balance sheet deterio ration? A classic profit squeeze. Life insur ance marketing and sales expenses have  continued to rise over the past few years,  but the nation's increasingly sophisticated  consumers are demanding products such as  universal life policies and annuities, leaving  insurers with slim profits, at best. Gone are  the days when simple whole  life policies  made up the bulk of an insurer's business.  Life  insurers, pitted against mutual funds  and brokerage firms for America's invest ment dollar, have in some cases resorted to  wildly aggressive tactics.  A case in point is Equitable, the giant in surer that got into big trouble with guaran teed investment contracts. Back in the late  1970s and early 1980s premium inflow from  consumers was slowing down, so Equitable  took  in money , to manage  from pension  funds at huge companies like General Dy namics and General Electric. To attract the  business, Equitable-and others-promised  higher long-term rates of returns than their  investment managers  could  realistically  hope to generate.  Other examples are I.C.H., a publicly held  Louisville, KY company that's big in univer sal life policies, and Integon, a sizable annu ity seller that troubled Southmark agreed  to sell in May. Both have seen the quality of  their  capital  bases  decline  significantly.  Knickerbocker Life Insurance, a 70-year-old  company out of El Paso, failed in May. The  company, which came up $22 million short  in receivership, was a big seller of annuities  with overly optimistic payout rates.  Low-profit and no-profit products-com bined with cutthroat competition-have hit  life  insurers hard. Nationwide,  the  indus try's returns on  surplus capital-roughly  equivalent to returns on equity for nonin surance companies-have steadily declined  from 15% in 1984 to 9.5% today.  Balance  sheets  have  deteriorated,  too.  During the 1980s, life insurers invested bil lions of dollars in junk bonds. Many compa nies were virtually forced to go for the high est yields because of the guaranteed invest  This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

PAT WILLIAMS  OF MONTANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 10, 1990  ",1990
498,987,7,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Speaker, today, I am in troducing, with my colleague from Pennsylva nia Mr. GOODLING,  the National Summit Con ference on Education Amendments of 1990.  Congress  enacted  the original  education  summit conference  legislation  in 1984. The  purpose of that legislation was to have an in clusive, organized discussion about proposals  for education  reform and about how  those  proposals could be implemented. That discus sion was to involve concerned individuals rep resenting all areas of education, business,  labor, and  the public.  It was be an  inclusive  approach, recognizing  that if we as a nation  are going to solve the problems facing educa tion, we must involve as many people as pos sible in the consideration of how those prob lems can be solved.  Since  the  initial enactment of  the summit  legislation in 1984, a number of events have  occurred. Congress has taken the necessary  steps to implement the summit. It has appoint ed  its Members  to  the summit's executive  committee.  The  Congress  appropriated  $500,000  to carry out  the activities of  the  summit. But  to date the all-inclusive summit  envisioned by Public Law 98-524 has yet to  come about.  The amendments we  offer  today  to  the  1984 law will conclude as Congress intended.  This  legislation changes  the composition of  the original executive committee. And, given  the action  to date by  the President and  the  Governors, it amends the summit's agenda to  include a consideration of  the now existing  goals and recommendations. Finally the legis lation encourages the critical determination as  to how  these goals might be  implemented,  and what levels of government have responsi bilities to bear in that implementation.  Mr. Speaker,  if we are to be successful in  reforming education in this Nation, we need to  involve the people who are to carry out those  reforms. The  legislation Mr. GOODLING and  I  introduce today is the final  legislative step in  that direction.  RUTHLESS ASSASSINATION OF  DR. KAZEM RAJAVI  10117  HON. JIM BATES  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 10, 1990  ",1990
499,987,7,Mr. BATES.," Mr. Speaker, I am certain many  of you, with great sadness, have  learned of  the  ruthless  assassination  of  a prominent  human  rights activist, Dr. Kazem Rajavi, by  the  Iranian  regime's mercenaries  in  recent  weeks. Dr. Rajavi, an outstanding international  representative of the  Iranian people's resist ance for peace and freedom, was the brother  of Mr. Massoud Rajavi,  the president of the  National Council of Resistance of  Iran, who  has perspicaciously  led a popular resistance  against the Tehran clerical tyranny for almost  a decade.  Dr. Rajavi devoted the last 19 years of his  life to unrelented activities against the dicta torships of the Shah and Khomeini. He often  attended  various  international  conferences  and forums to expose the unabated violations  of human rights in Iran and to defend the very  rights  that the  Iranian people had  fought  for  and sacrificed so many  lives  for under  the  Shah's tyranny.  After  the  fall of the Shah, Dr. Rajavi was  Iran's first Ambassador to the U.N. headquar ters in Geneva. However, shortly after his ap pointment, he resigned his post in protest to  the repressive policies and  terrorist activities  of the ruling clerics in Iran. He then intensified  his campaign against mass executions, arbi trary arrests, and the medieval tortures exer cised by the clerics in Tehran. Since the for mation of the National Council of Resistance  in 1981, Dr. Rajavi had been representing the  Iranian Resistance  in many  international as semblies, and every year headed  the  resist ance delegation to the U.N. General Assembly  in New York and  the Commission of Human  rights  in Geneva. His constant and effective  efforts, prompting international attention to the  horrible situation in  Iran, resulted  in condem nation of the Iranian clerical despotism by the  United Nations and a variety of other human  rights organizations in the past few years.  Dr. Rajavi was a resident of France  from  1957  to 1968, and subsequently  resided  in  Switzerland, where  he was  given  political  asylum. He received six doctorate degrees in  the fields of law, political science and sociolo gy from the universities of Paris and Geneva,  where he held professorship's post in the last  10 years.  Due to his active and effective role in con demning  the medieval autocracy  ruling  Iran,  the  regime's authorities despised him  and  plotted his murder. On many occasions, he  was reportedly threatened with death by the  Khomeini regime's terrorist-diplomats and per sonal envoys of Rafsanjani, the Iranian Presi dent,  to Europe. Nonetheless, he constantly  and bravely confronted Khomeini's agents in  the various organs of the United Nations, en gaging  in a  full-fledged struggle  for human  rights and for helping to establish a democrat ically  elected government by  the National  Council of Resistance of Iran.

500,1013,7,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, I thank  my distinguished colleague from West  Virginia. As I  indicated this morning  before he came on the floor, no one  has been stouter  in  this effort. He  called for a record number of cloture  votes in this body, trying to break a  filibuster, trying to have us have real  campaign reform, when he served this  body as majority leader. He worked in  this body for every single piece of cam paign reform legislation since he has  been here, and he has been a inspira tion for me.  He has been  the historian of  the  U.S. Senate. He has the perspective.  He knows better than any other Sena tor the degree to which this institu tion is being corrupted and its prior ities being twisted.  The schedule of the Senate is being  set, not on the basis of solving people's  problems, not to give us time to think  our best  thoughts and  to share our  thoughts with each other; the sched ule is set on the basis of when we have  to be  in recess so people can go  to  fundraisers and raise money instead of  working here to solve problems.  ",1990
501,1013,7,Mr. BYRD., Will the Senator yield?  ,1990
502,1013,7,Mr. BOREN.,  I will  be happy  to  yield.  ,1990
503,1013,7,Mr. BYRD.," Not only do we not have  time  to  think and  to  reflect and  to  come up with new creative ideas, but  we are not masters of our own fates.  Our new  ideas may be fine, but will  the special interests that contribute to  us support  them? Do Members vote  their own minds,  their own hearts,  their own consciences? That is a rhe torical  question.  Everyone  in  here  knows that Members do not vote their  own minds on some of the issues that  are so important to this country. Ev eryone knows  that Members do not  vote their own minds and their own  consciences on many issues, realizing  that the great body politic out there is  not  organized  and  represented,  be cause we are so busy presenting the  views of those who contribute to us in  many  instances,  and voting  against  what we know in our hearts is best.  So ""the fault, dear Brutus, is not in  our stars, but in ourselves, that we are  underlings,"" the underlings of the spe cial  interests  that contribute  to our  campaigns.  ",1990
504,1013,7,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, I cannot  add to what the Senator from West  Virginia has just said. He has dramati cally stated the situation as it frankly  is.  I hope that all of our colleagues,  those hearing us and those who will  read the words of the Senator in the  RECORD will heed those words, and we  will not allow another week, another  month, another year to go by until we  act  on meaningful  reform  of  this  system.  I have talked about two major ele ments of reform: The need to stop the  runaway spiral of spending;  to get it  under  control,  to  stop  the money  chase. I have talked about the need to  have a level playing field for challeng ers.  The Senator from West Virginia has  just touched upon another very impor tant element of true reform; that is, to  reduce the participation, or the level  of influence, to get some balance back  into the system so that the special in terest groups will not have an undue  influence. Over  half  the Members  elected to Congress last time received  mbre  than half  their contributions,  not from individual contributors, but  from  interest groups,  from political  action  committees  and  others  that  rated Members solely on their range  of issues rather than on total issues.  So some balance needs to be put back  in.  The President has indicated he sup ports,  in essence,  removing political  action committees almost completely  from  the process  in contributing  to  campaigns.  Proposals made  on  the  other side of the aisle have merit, pro posals that many of us have made ear lier,  including  the proposal  I made  many years ago with Senator Gold water from Arizona, to move on that  front. The bill introduced by the Sena tor from West Virginia and myself a  few years ago tried to strike a balance  and set an aggregate percentage on  the amount that can come from spe cial  interest groups,  as well  as  the  amount of money that can come from  the contributors back home. The bill  introduced on the other side of  the  aisle bans political action committees  from  contributing  to  candidates  in  Federal elections.  Again, as a  sign of our desire  to  reach out to the other side, to indicate  that we are trying to have a meeting  of the minds, our bill, the substitute  amendment which will  be  printed  today, also provides that no longer will  candidates  for  Congress,  for  the  Senate, be able  to acccept contribu tions  from political actions commit tees. So that is another test, reducing  the influence of special interests.  What is another test of true reform?  True reform cannot  leave any  loop holes unclosed;  it cannot allow  for  money  to simply pop up  in another  form; that if you close out money in  one area, for example, from undue in fluence from special interests or the  amount of money going to candidates  themselves, you cannot simply  then  open up another loophole to allow the  money  to pour  in  through another  source.  The media has reported widely re cently about the soft money loophole,  the millions of dollars being poured in  in undisclosed contributions, primarily  to State parties for what are essential ly mixed activities;  that is, activities  like phone banks, generic advertising  and mailing  that are conducted on  behalf of all candidates, both Federal  and State, in the same election. And  since they are mixed, they, therefore,  do not fall strictly under a Federal  election provision. An estimated $60  million is going through that source.  Even in the aftermath of Watergate  when we thought we had stopped a sit uation where some individual, through  immense wealth, can have undue in fluence  on  the  process, where we  thought we had individuals limited to  $25,000 contributions  to all political  groups  in  a  year's  time, we  have  turned around and seen  fundraisers  being held, and we have to say by both  political  parties.  We  have  seen  $100,000 fundraisers. You can have a  $500,000 fundraiser if you wanted to if  it were all going in the form of soft  money back to some State party or or ganization for the purpose of running  campaigns there.  We have  to stop  this. We have to  plug  the  soft money  loophole,  and  that is exactly what we have done in  the amendment which we will be pro posing.  I have to say I think this is one of  those areas where I hope those on the  other side of the aisle will agree to our  proposal  because,  unfortunately,  theirs still leaves wide open the soft  money loophole. They fall back to cur rent law which has a theory that you  can somehow divide the money coming  into a State party for an election cycle  where both Federal and State candi dates are running and you can appor tion it.  That is what the current laws says  can be done. It has never been done ef fectively because no one has figured  out how to do  it. They have gotten  around it. If there are 20 State candi dates on  the ballot and 1  for  the  Senate, therefore, if you give $100,000,  one-twentieth of that is going to be  viewed as contributions that fall under  Federal limits. Unions can make direct  contributions; corporations can make  direct contributions-the sky  is  the  limit.  If we were  to  leave  that  loophole  open and put some sort of limits on  other  forms of spending, before we  know it, instead of having $60 million  of soft money, we would have $200  million of soft money. So that is why,  Mr. President, we have closed  that  loophole.

505,1039,7,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President, I  rise today to talk about a letter that  recently appeared in a newspaper in  our State, and contains some very pro found  truths,  from a young woman  who is 12 years old. The young woman  is Lindsay Weiler, of Minnetonka, MN.  It is a short letter but one really quite  eloquent. It graphically  laid out the  environmental changes  faced  today.  She wrote the following:  AFTER THE RAIN  I don't know how other people feel, but I  hate pollution. Take acid rain for one. It's  destroying our lakes and rivers. I was walk ing outside one day after it had rained, and  I saw a puddle with a million colors. I knew  then that the rain hadn't been fresh. Even  though I'm only 12,  I would like to help.  This is the world I live in, and I don't want  it ruined for my children.  This is a very moving letter, a letter  that I wanted to share with my col leagues. The environment is one of the  most important issues with which we  deal, and, while we may frequently get  caught up with debating environmen tal legislation, I think it is important  we do not lose sight of the goal that  she points out, preserving the environ ment and preserving  it for her and  other 12-year-olds, who deserve  the  same clean environment in which to  live their lives and raise children.  I understand that in parts of Europe  the pollution is so bad today that the  songbirds have  left.  Is not  that a  shame? But we passed a clean air bill  here recently  that I  think will pre serve the songbirds in our country and  a farm bill that is now being consid ered  that will preserve  the swamp lands and wetlands for ducks, geese,  and/or birds that require them.  I was  touched by Lindsay's simple  plea, and I want to share it with my  colleagues.  FLAWED  INVESTIGATION  OF  THE MURDERS OF PRIESTS IN  EL SALVADOR  ",1990
506,1039,7,Mr.  PELL.," Mr.  President,  I  am  deeply concerned by the reports ema nating from El Salvador which indi cate that Salvadoran authorities may  be obstructing justice in the investiga tion of the murders of the six Jesuit  priests and  two housekeepers at the  Central American University  in No vember. According  to press  reports,  the Salvadoran  authorities  are not  conducting  a  serious  investigation.  The most startling report is that evi dence crucial to the case against Colo nel Benavides,  the head of the mili tary school and commander of  the  unit  responsible  for  the murders,  is  missing. On the very heels of Con gressman MOAKLEY's  report, which  concluded that the  investigation has  been stalled and that little attempt  has been made to determine if mem bers of  the military high command  were involved, we now read more dis turbing news. Colonel Benavides' per sonal  notebook,  possibly  containing  notes on meetings held in the military  school before and after the murders,  and the logbook, recording who that  night entered and  left  the military  school, are mysteriously missing. Fur thermore, it seems more than coinci dental that four cadets on guard duty  that night at the military school and  who potentially could provide key in formation, have been transferred out  of the country for training.  I have tried to maintain a positive  attitude about El Salvador. I am con vinced that President Cristiani, despite  tremendous pressures from within his  Government, wants  to do  the  right  thing.  I am encouraged by  the fact  that serious efforts  to end the civil  war are being made under the auspices  of the United Nations as evidenced by  the formal talks between the Govern ment and  the FMLN scheduled  for  next week in Caracas. I am encouraged  that,  although  serious  differences  remain with the Congress, the Bush  administration,  as  reported  in  the  Washington Post on May 2, may now  be accepting the fact that conditional ity related to various aspects of the  human rights situation will be part of  the military assistance package for El  Salvador.  I believe that we could be on the  verge of moving in a positive way to fi nally end the civil war in El Salvador,  but the Salvadoran Government's per formance thus far in the case against  Colonel Benavides looms as a major  obstacle  to continued United States  military aid to El Salvador. The stakes  are  high  and  President  Cristiani  knows  it.  In  a  communique  issued  Tuesday, the Salvadoran Government  vowed  to make available  the absent  witnesses and to help recover the miss ing evidence. This is needed and more.  The Salvadoran Armed Forces must be  made  to understand  that after  all  these years, patience in this country  has worn very thin. A full  investiga tion, without obstruction, must be con ducted in order to get to the bottom of  this case. Those who are guilty must  be brought to justice. It is imperative  that this obstacle to peace in El Salva dor be removed.  Under the current circumstances, I  cannot support continued military as sistance to El Salvador.  POLISH-AMERICAN  HERITAGE  MONTH: THE CELEBRATION OF  A  UNIQUE  AND  IMPORTANT  RELATIONSHIP  ",1990
507,1039,7,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, recently, I  became a cosponsor of Senate Joint  Resolution 289, which designates Oc. tober 1990, as Polish-American Herit age Month. I believe it is an appropri ate moment for us  to salute Poland  and Polish-Americans.  Americans of Polish descent have  had a decisive impact on the develop ment of American culture, and Senate  Joint Resolution 289 properly calls at tention  to  important milestones  in  United States history  that have  in volved Polish-Americans. Yet events  that have occurred during  the past  year truly epitomize the strength of  the bonds between the United States  and Poland. For this reason, the long standing tradition of commemorating  Polish-American  Heritage  Month  takes on added depth and new mean ing.  Earlier this week, Lesek Balcerowicz,  the Polish Deputy Prime Minister and  Finance Minister, met with the Com mittee on Foreign Relations. When  Mr. Balcerowicz, the architect of Po land's economic reform program, last  visited the committee, Prime Minister  Tadeusz Mazowiecki had just assumed  office, and the world was beginning to  recognize the import of what was oc curring in Poland. Indeed, Poland had  become the leader of Eastern Europe's  revolution of 1989.  Now,  Poland  is  undergoing what  many call its second revolution, and its  greatest challenge will be to address  its heavy debt burden and reform its  troubled economy. Western observers  recognized all along that this crucial  task would not be easy, and as Mr. Bal cerowicz  told  the Foreign Relations  Committee, Poland will  continue  to  need our s µpport  as it progresses along  the path of reform.  During the past year, Polish-Ameri cans  have  responded  to  events  in  Poland with remarkable vigor. I have  received countless letters in my office  from  Polish-Americans  in  Rhode  ",1990
508,1078,7,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, the two  highest elected officials in the State of  Connecticut, William A. O'Neill, who  has served as Governor  longer  than  any one person since the early years of  the Republic, and Lt. Gov. Joseph J.  Fauliso, will retire to private life when  their terms expire next year.  These men  have  between  them  nearly five decades of service to Con necticut. Our  State  has  benefited  greatly  from  their devotion  to  the  public good.  Earlier this week Governor O'Neill  gave his farewell address to the Con necticut General Assembly. Mr. Presi dent, I ask that his moving remarks be  printed in the RECORD.  The remarks follow:  GOVERNOR O'NEILL'$ CLOSING REMARKS TO  THE 1990 GENERAL ASSEMBLY  Reverend Clergy, Mr. Speaker, Honorable  President Pro Tern, Majority Leaders, Mi nority Leaders, Men and Women of  the  General Assembly, People of Connecticut.  The hour is late. The night has been long.  I have no intention of detaining you unnec essarily. Nevertheless, I must ask your in dulgence on what, for me, is an occasion of  great moment ... a moment which will  never return.  This evening marks not only my  tenth  closing address to the General Assembly. It  is also my last opportunity as Governor to  address this body in joint convention.  This year, for the first time since the fall  of 1960, I will not participate with you in  the electoral process  as  a  candidate  for  office. Therefore, your night of exultation,  relief and resolve is for me a night of quiet  reflection.  In the frantic rush of the modern political  process, moments of quiet  reflection are  few. I would like to share mine on this last  night we have together.  Here, at the close of our short legislative  session, we have come to the end of an in tense  and highly  technical process. The  sounds of  that process  have  filled  this  chamber and our nearby conference and  hearing rooms with a strange terminology  which is in many ways foreign to the human  tongue and  inconsistent with  the human  values which we as the elected representa tives of our great people are sworn to ad vance.  The babble of ""j.f.""'s, ""p.t.""'s, ""points of  order"" and ""points of information"" at times  seems almost loud enough to drown out the  voices of the people whom we are elected to  serve. Now, as the process of legislation ap proaches  its conclusion,  it  is  appropriate  that we sharpen our focus on people-the  people of government with whom we work  and the people of Connecticut whom we are  sworn to serve.  For me, the true greatness of my experi ence in government has been people. Since  first coming to Hartford as the elected rep resentative of my small town of East Hamp ton, I have had the honor and privilege of  serving with some 800 other individuals like wise elected to do the public's business in  these honored halls.  I  remember  the governors-John Demp sey      Tom Meskill      Ella Grasso.  And, as I look about this chamber tonight,  see a  few of  the  faces which  initially  I  became familiar to me on that cold winter  day in January of 1967 when I first raised  my  hand  to  take Connecticut's oath of  office.  I  see Dick Gosselin and  remember  the  moment when he solemnly advised me that  he would not serve another term of office. I  am referring to the first such advisory, of  course, which was in 1967. And there's Doc  Gunther, a man who even in 1967 had the  same humble and reserved nature as he has  today. Dick Torpey also was at the capitol  in 1967 and was blind then, as he is now, to  all colors but green. I first came to know  Jack Tiffany,  the  earnest  farmer  from  Lyme, in that year. I since have become well  acquainted with both Jack and his ox, Tom,  who occasionally accompanies him on his  trips here. Then, of course,  there's Bruce  Morris, who sometimes departs these prem ises, but always returns-in one capacity or  the other. I read that he may want to come  back  in still another capacity again next  year.  And, of course, here, at the dais, I have  the strength and support-as always-of my  old friends and long-term running mate, our  Lieutenant Governor, Joe Fauliso.  And there are faces  long departed from  these chambers which nevertheless are very  fresh in my own mind. There is the gentle  dignity of Dorothy Goodwin,        the un flinching debating style of Dick Schneller        the statesmanship of Lew Rome       the meticulously prepared and always com bative Gerry Stevens       the fair mind of  Fran Collins       the strong leadership of  Jim Kennelly       my great friends John  Groppo and Tim Moynihan. I vividly recall  absent  friends        Stu McKinney        Audrey Beck      Dave Neiditz      Tom  Foley.  I  think  fondly and sometimes sadly of  these and the many other colleagues who  have gone on from this place, but then I  look at the bright young faces of those who  have succeeded to their mantle of leader ship .and my optimism returns. I see in your  faces today, even at the end of a difficult  session, the same energies and enthusiasms,  the  same compassion and understanding,  which have guided the General Assemblies  of the past.  In  singling out  these  individuals,  I  of  course intend no slight to those I have not  mentioned. Their numbers are legion and  the time is short. My purpose in mentioning  these few is simply to emphasize for all that  this body is first an assembly of people and  only second a process to be mastered and  controlled.  We are not in an age of instant communi cation and diminishing spans of attention.  Sensational and often slashing sound bites  have replaced reasoned and eloquent per suasion  as  the  debating  staple  of  the  modern candidate or elected official. We  seem readier today to accuse than we are to  deliberate       to personalize than to per suade.  The media have exalted controversy over  compromise and some public officials have  followed  suit. Yet,  for my money,  I will  never completely  trust a politican who  is  more comfortable  in front of a  television  camera than he or she is in the living room  of a constituent.  We,  the elected  representatives of  the  people, have a duty to those who with their  votes have made us a part of this state's glo rious history. We must be a proud part of  that history. We must remain civil and re spect each other or risk the loss not only of  our civility but of all the human sentiments  ",1990

DESECRATION OF JEWISH  CEMETERIES IN FRANCE  <Mrs. SCHROEDER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks, and  to  include  therein  extraneous material.)  ",1990
511,1091,7,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker,  this weekend's revelations of graves  being desecrated in Jewish cemeteries  sickens any civilized person. In 1790  the Hebrew congregation in Newport,  RI, was  so  fearful  of  persecution,  there was an escape door and tunnel  put in the middle of the temple. Our  first President, George Washington,  took up his pen and wrote to this har assed  congregation. His words  and  vision  give  me  goosebumps,  they  convey the very essence of America's  foundation being grounded in religious  tolerance. I include the text of George  Washington's letter:  To  the Hebrew Congregation  RI.  Gentlemen, while I receive with much sat isfaction your address replete with expresAUGUST 17, 1790.  in Newport,  sions of affection and esteem, I  rejoice in  the opportunity of assuring you that I shall  always  retain a grateful  remembrance of  the cordial welcome  I experienced  in my  visit to Newport from all classes of Citizens.  The reflection on the days of difficulty  and danger which are past is rendered the  more sweet from a consciousness that they  are succeeded by days of uncommon pros perity and security. If we have the wisdom  to make the best use of the advantages with  which we are now favored, we cannot fail,  under the just administration of a good gov ernment  to  become  a  great  and happy  people.  The Citizens  of  the United States of  America have a right to applaud themselves  for having given to Mankind examples of an  enlarged and liberal policy, a policy worthy  of imitation. All possess alike liberty of con science and immunities of citizenship. It is  now no more that toleration is spoken of, as  if it was by the indulgence of one class of  people, that another enjoyed the exercise of  their inherent natural rights. For happily  the Government  of  the United  States,  which gives to bigotry no sanction, to perse cution no assistance, requires only that they  who live under its protection should demean  themselves as good citizens, in giving it on  all occasions their effectual support.  It would be inconsistent with the frank ness of my character not to avow that I am  pleased with your favorable opinion of my  administration, and fervent wishes for my  felicity.  May the children of the Stock of Abra ham, who dwell  in this land, continue  to  merit and enjoy the good will of the other  inhabitants, while  every one  shall sit  in  safety under his own vine and fig tree, and  there shall be none to make him afraid.  May the Father of all mercies scatter light  and not darkness in our paths, and make us  all in ouT several vocations useful here, and  in his own due time and way everlastingly  happy.  G. WASHINGTON.  SUPPORT AMERICANS WITH  DISABILITIES ACT  <Mr. MAZZOLI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1990
512,1091,7,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, the day  after  tomorrow, on Wednesday,  the  House will have  an opportunity  to  debate, and then to vote and pass, I  hope,  the bill called  the Americans  With Disabilities Act.  This, I believe, Mr. Speaker, will be  one of the most important bills and  one of the most important civil rights  acts which  the  lOlst Congress will  have an opportunity to adopt.  The Americans With Disabilities Act  is a bill which will give Americans who  have  disabilities  an opportunity  to  function as workers in the workplace,  as mothers and fathers, as citizens and  as taxpayers of our community.  This is one opportunity for America,  I believe,  to cast a vote through the  House of Representatives for competi tiveness. Because as we look down the  road  to  the year 2000, Mr. Speaker,  this Nation will need talented people  in the work force if we are to be competitive with all of the trading part ners around the world.  Part of this effort to have a solid tal ented work force is to go into untradi tional areas to do our recruiting. We  will be  recruiting more women, and  therefore  the bill on child care and  the related bills we have had will be  helpful. We will have to go  into the  marketplace for people who have dis abilities.  So I would urge my colleagues who  have certainly every right to be proud  of this to cast that vote on Wednesday  with pride on behalf of the Americans  With Disabilities Act.  0 1210  TRIBUTE TO DR. AND MRS.  WILLIAM NARVA  (Mrs. BOGGS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)  ",1990
513,1091,7,Mrs. BOGGS.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  a great deal of sadness that I note the  departure of Dr. William Narva as the  attending physician of the House of  Representatives of  the Capitol. We  have enjoyed his services for many,  many years, for 20 years as a consult ant to the attending physician, and for  the past 4 years as the attending phy sician of  the Congress. He has  ren dered such good and efficient service  with such a personal attitude of inter est and compassion. We will certainly  miss his services very much.  Dr. Narva  is also  retiring after 35  years of distinguished service  to  the  U.S. Navy, and we salute him for his  service in that regard. The whole city  of Washington will miss Bill N arva  and his remarkable wife Rose Narva.  She has in this city brought back the  Carlton Hotel and the Jefferson Hotel.  She has helped to rejuvenate the kind  of gracious ho{)pitality for which this  city was previously known. We will  miss her  touch on  the Washington  scene as well.  Mr. Speaker, I wish them, of course,  godspeed in their retirement to Cali fornia, where they will be joining their  son David, and I know that they will  have many years of happiness there.

524,1117,7,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  I am  hopeful that our colleagues will sup port Senator KENNEDY and me and the  62 other cosponsors-there are 4 of  us-in moving forward with this legis lation. This bill actually emphasizes  aspects of the AIDS epidemic that no  other Federal initiative has addressed  in such a comprehensive manner. The  bill targets funds directly for pediatric  AIDS  patients.  For  children who  through no fault of their own, no high  risk conduct on their part, have con tracted AIDS.  We are talking here about children  who  contracted  this  deadly  virus  through no fault of their own. We are  talking about children who have AIDS  because  they  received HIV-infected  blood, or because their mothers were  carriers of the virus. We are talking  about children like Ryan White and  Ariel Glaser. We are talking about the  2,200  children who have contracted  AIDS and the over 1,000 children who  have died from this dreadful disease.  This bill also begins  to  recognize  that the AIDS epidemic has not es caped rural America. When we think  of AIDS, we may see images of New  York City, or Los Angeles, or San  Francisco. But the fact is that AIDS is  in the rural North, it is in the rural  South, rural Midwest, in the rural New  England and rural West of the United  States, and every other part of the  country.  This bill also comes to grips with the  adverse ramifications that the disease  has  on  our Nation's  health  care  system. Health care providers, particu larly  urban  hospitals,  have  been  stretched to the limit to provide treat ment for AIDS patients who are large ly low income.  Mr. President, there is not a single  Member of the Senate, Republican or  Democrat, who would not jump into  the water  to  save  someone who  is  drowning.  I do not think any of us  would fail to get in there and do our  best. We would do  it without  first  asking how he or she happened to fall  into  the water or happened  to  lose  their confidence  to swim. We would  jump in and help.  This bill is not a debate about fac tors  causing  individuals  to  contract  AIDS. It is not a debate about the effi cacy of education programs. This bill  is simply an effort by those of us in  this body who want to do something to  ",1990
525,1143,7,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President, I am  an original cosponsor of the National  Health Service Corps Revitalization  Act of 1990, which reauthorizes and  improves our current National Health  Service Corps program. I commend my  colleague from Massachusetts for care fully drafting this bill so that it has  generated broad support, particularly  from  the rural health community.  I  also want to thank him for adding to  the bill an important title similar to  legislation I  introduced  in February,  establishing State Offices  of Rural  Health.  This year marks the 20th anniversa ry  of  the National Health Service  Corps CNHSCJ, which provides schol arships or  repays health  education  loans for physicians and other health  professionals willing to serve in areas  with shortages of health care provid ers.  Over 12 million Americans  live  in  areas  lacking  primary  health  care  services. According to the Department  of Health and Human Services, my  own State of Mississippi has 58 health  manpower shortage areas. We need  107 additional health care providers in  Mississippi  to serve citizens living in  these  areas.  The National Health  Service Corps Revitalization Act of  1990 will help Mississippi and other  States meet health needs by enhanc ing the Federal commitment to help  States  address  their  shortages  of  health care professionals.  The National Health Service Corps  Revitalization  Act  emphasizes  the  need to recruit a variety of health care  providers, such as nurses, midwives,  physician  assistants,  and  mental  health workers, and gives special at tention  to  recruitment of more pri mary care physicians in short supply  in rural communities throughout the  Nation.  The bill  improves the current pro gram by  targeting  scholarships and  loan repayments to individuals whose  backgrounds and educational experi ences increase the likelihood of long term service. Priority will be given to  applicants residing in health manpow er shortage areas, coming from disad vantaged and minority backgrounds,  or showing an  interest  in providing  primary care services  to underserved  areas by participation in clinical pro grams.  It also establishes  incentives  for medical schools and other health  professional  schools  which  expose  their students to programs that pro vide primary care services to medically  underserved areas.  Another  important element of  the  bill is the establishment of State Of fices of Rural Health. In February, I  introduced S. 2187,  the State Offices  of Rural Health Act of  1990. The  House companion version, introduced  last August  by Congressman  STEN HOLM of Texas, has been incorporated  into the House version of the National  Health Service Corps reauthorization  bill.  The Department  of Health  and  Human Services established the Office  of Rural Health Policy in 1987 to work  within the Department and with other  Federal agencies, States, national asso ciations,  foundations,  and  private  sector organizations to seek solutions  to  rural health care problems. The  office has very effectively disseminat ed information to those seeking assist ance in rural health care delivery.  To supplement Federal efforts, I be lieve it is important for each State to  build its own infrastructure to facili tate coordinated approaches to rural  health care problems. Since it is evi dent that solutions to these problems  will require cooperative effort, I intro duced  the State Offices  of Rural  Health  Act  to  establish  Federal  matching grants to encourage creation  of State offices of rural health and to  augment those already in existence.  These offices will  concentrate on  eliminating deficiencies  in our rural  health care delivery systems. Unham pered by unnecessary Federal require ments, they will have maximum flexi bility to meet community needs within  each State and will coordinate with  other public and private health agen cies and with the Agricultural Exten sion Service.  Among other things, they will exam ine rural health care and recommend  improvements in quality and cost ef fectiveness, assist in recruitment and  retention  of  health  professionals,  make recommendations to the Federal  Office of Rural Health Policy for con sideration  as part of Federal  rural  health policy,  identify Federal and  State  programs  regarding  rural  health, and provide  technical assist ance  to public and nonprofit private  entities  regarding  participation  in  such programs.  States will decide how  to organize  these offices, whether within another  agency or through an educational in stitution or private contracting organi zation. However organized, the aim of  these State Offices of Rural Health  will be the integration of State, Feder al, and private sector activities and the  development of  innovative  solutions  for improving access to quality care in  rural communities.  Mr. President, I am pleased to be an  original  cosponsor  of  the National  Health Service Corps Revitalization  Act of 1990. Through this bill and the  administration's commitment  to  the  corps  through  its budget  request,  I  hope we can remedy the health care  deficiencies in the 1,955 health man power shortage areas  in the Nation,  1,337 of which are  located  in  rural  America.  I urge other Senators to work for en actment of this important legislation.  ",1990
526,1143,7,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President, I  am pleased to join today as an original  cosponsor of legislation to reauthorize  and  revitalize  the National Health  Service Corps.  Although it has been weakened by  budget cuts in recent years,  the Na tional Health Service Corps continues  to play a vital role in making primary  health care available to medically un derserved  areas.  The  corps  offers  scholarships or repays loans for doc tors and other health professionals. In  return, these providers agree to prac tice  in  health manpower  shortage  areas for a determined period of time.  If adopted,  the  legislation  intro duced today will breath new life into  this 20-year-old 'program and,  in so  doing, will  help  bring  desperately  needed primary health care services to  the 33 million Americans who contin ue to live in areas without such care.  This bill will be particularly benefi cial to America's remote rural commu nities, many of which are suffering  from increasingly acute medical man power shortages. As we are all aware,  low Medicare reimbursements, declin ing population bases, and drought-bur dened  economies  have  dangerously  weakened rural hospital care and have  helped  drive  physicians  and  other  health professionals out of rural prac tice. In my own home State of Kansas,  for example, fully 50 of the State's 105  counties have been identified by the  University of Kansas Medical Center  as being critically underserved in pri mary care.  Early in this decade, Congress and  the administration reacted to projec tions of an upcoming physician sur plus by significantly reducing funding  for the National Health Service Corps.  a  result,  the  corps'  total  field  strength  has  declined  dramatically,  from over 3,100 providers in 1986  to  fewer than 1,700 in 1989.

527,1182,7,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, Friday, May  18 marks the release date of a book about a  remarkable American. ""Goya, Come Home"" is  the biography of Coya Knutson, Minnesota's  first woman  to be elected  to a  full  term  in  Congress.  The title of the book refers to a letter from  Goya's husband, asking her  to give up her  congressional career after 4 years and return  to Minnesota. The  letter was  leaked  to  the  press and grabbed the attention of the voters  in Goya's rural district.  It also brought on her  defeat in the next election.  In her short  tenure  in Washington,  from  1955 through 1959, Goya Knutson's career is  studded with remarkable accomplishments:  She was the first woman appointed to the  House Agriculture Committee. Acting on  the  counsel  of my  predecessor, Congressman  John Blatnik, Coya wrote  to Speaker Sam  Rayburn and Majority Leader John McCor mack asking for the appointment.  Rayburn appointed her  to  the committee  over the protests of its chairman, Representa tive Harold Cooley. The Speaker responded to  Cooley's objections by  telling  the chairman,  ""Coya Knutson did  the  impossible by getting  elected and she's going  to get her pick of  committees.""  Knutson  and  Cooley  later  became good friends.  As a member of the Agriculture Committee,  Coya was a champion of the family farm. She  was  instrumental  in establishing credit pro grams  for  farm  improvement and expansion.  She worked for price supports for sugar beet  farmers and supported soil conservation pro grams. She helped enlarge the Federal school  lunch program as a solution  to farm surplus  problems. Her first speech on the House floor  pleaded  for maintaining  farm price supports,  declaring  that  ""adequate  farm  income  is a  task we must achieve for the economic health  and welfare of the country.""  In 1957, Americans looked upward and saw  the Soviet Sputnik orbiting  the Earth. Our  post-war bubble of euphoria burst and new ini tiatives in education were needed. Goya Knut son introduced the ""Dollars for Scholars"" Pro gram to help worthy students afford a college  education. ""Even though education  is a right  in a democracy,"" she  told her House col leagues, ""we have seen destitute students go  by unnoticed. The opportunity for capable stu dents to go to college is the latest horizon to  be faced."" Her program was written into title II  of  the National Defense Education Act of  May '14, 1990  1958 and  enabled a generation of young  people to receive college degrees.  She proposed an omnibus education bill  that would channel one-fourth of the defense  budget into elementary and secondary educa tion. Although  this bill-nicknamed  the Paul  Bunyan bill, after  the north country  lumber jack who accomplished great things-did not  pass during her term in office, a modified ver sion of it passed during the Kennedy adminis tration and became the first large-scale Feder al Education Program.  The first Federal grant to support cystic fi brosis research was the result of Goya's work.  H.R. 12331, passed May 5, 1958, appropri ated $1 million  to  fight  this disease, at  that  time  the  third  leading  killer of children. A  major portion of the funds was awarded to the  University of Minnesota, and Coya was hon ored  for her efforts by  the Minneapolis-St.  Paul chapter of  the Cystic Fibrosis Founda tion.  It was Goya Knutson who proposed a Fed eral  income  tax checkoff  to support public  funding  for Presidential campaigns. Like  the  Paul  Bunyan  bill,  this  legislation  did  not  become  law until after Coya had  left Con gress.  These accomplishments are chronicled  in  ""Coya Come Home,""  the biography of Coya  Knutson by Gretchen Urnes Beito.  I recom mend  this  book  to my  colleagues  in  the  House.  Goya Knutson was a dedicated and able  legislator. She was a champion of working  people and  family  farmers. She worked  to  educate our children and keep them healthy.  She was cut from the same cloth as Senator  Hubert Humphrey, with whom  she worked  very closely. Her accomplishments and  the  spirit with which she achieved them make me  proud  to continue  the  tradition of service  to  the people of Minnesota in Congress.  Goya Knutson  is  now a 77-years-young  grandmother,  living  in Bloomington, MN. She  will be the guest of honor at a special recep tion hosted by Governor and Mrs. Rudy Per pich at the Governor's residence on May 18,  to celebrate the release of her biography.  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, please join me  in paying  tribute to a very special  lady, Con gresswoman Coya Knutson.

535,1195,7,Mr. HATCH.," Than you, Mr. Presi dent. Mr. President, this bill is called  the CARE bill. I think this vote on clo ture  shows how much we  all  care  about this. It was 95 to 3. I hope there  will be no further delays in pursuing  this legislation.  This  is  important  legislation. It is  public  health  legislation.  I  think  nobody  should miss  that particular  point. I do not care what the underly ing cause of AIDS is. All  I know is  there  is  a  problem out  there  that  needs to be addressed. We cannot ad dress it by sitting back and ignoring it.  We are going to have to approach  this problem in a caring,  intelligent,  compassionate, and decent way. That  is what this bill does.  As a conservative, I hate to add any  more spending to our Federal Govern ment. We have enough, and I would  like  us  instead  to make  priority  choices  among  different  competing  programs. But if I had to make a pri ority choice, this would be one of the  recog If  is  priorities I would choose, because it  means a lot to this country; it means a  lot to everybody in this country.  We simply have  to alleviate pain,  suffering and difficulty, not just for  those who have AIDS, but also  for  those who are surrounded by people  with AIDS-the families of those who  have AIDS, and the health care pro fessionals who work with this condi tion all  the  time. This  includes  the  doctors, the nurses, and other health  care practitioners in the hospitals, par ticularly in the 13 large cities that are  targeted  in  title  I  of  this bill. We  cannot ignore this need and act like it  is going  to go away  if we don't do  something about it.  Mr. President, most ot us have heard  the stories of family members whose  loved ones are suffering from AIDS.  We  have  seen  babies with AIDS,  babies abandoned  in hospital wards.  We have  seen both our  rural and  urban health care systems strained to  the very limit.  We have to respond to. this crisis and  this call for help. This legislation re sponds to the diverse treatment needs  of  those who have AIDS,  including  children and families. It provides relief  for hospitals and other community based programs straining under  the  economic burden of providing compas sionate care to  those with AIDS. It  sends the necessary financial support  to our research community  to help  them find effective therapies.  Today, in considering the CARE bill  that will  fill  in  the cracks  in our  health care system, we have the op portunity  to  show  compassion  for  those who are infected with HIV. This  bill sends a strong message. It sends a  message of hope, of care, of charity. It   sends a message to the families who  have a child  infected with the HIV  virus that they are not forgotten and  that we all want to help.  Let us not get trapped into inaction  because of how or why people became  infected. Let us instead follow Presi dent Bush's wise counsel when he said.  In this Nation,  in this decade,  there  is  only one way to deal with an individual who  is sick. With dignity, compassion, care, con fidentiality  and without  discrimination.  Once disease strikes-we don't blame those  who are suffering. We don't spurn the acci dent victim who didn't wear a seatbelt. We  don't reject the cancer patient who didn't  quit smoking. We try to love them and care  for them and comfort them. We do not fire  them, or evict them, or cancel their insur ance.  Those are good words by President  Bush. Today, let us give every person  who has AIDS hope. Let us care for  them as no society has every cared  before. Let us not condemn them to  death.  Some have called AIDS the No. 1  threat to our national and, possibly,  international health. As of the end of  March 1990,  over 125,000 American  ",1990
536,1221,7,Mr. HATCH.," I do not want to pro long this, but I was one of the original  sponsors when we were so overrun by  the Federal Government that we lost  help especially  in public-land States  such  as Utah, Nevada, Wyoming,  almost all of the Western States. So  there is nobody who feels more deeply  about what we should be doing for the  public-land States  or  the Western  States or the smaller States than I do.  But this is a  rural bill. It is both  urban and rural. We do take care of  the 13 largest cities because they have  a crisis on their hands. They are being  overwhelmed and they need the help.  We also take care of other communi ties, including rural areas. We insisted  on this in title II; half of the money of  this bill goes  to help with problems  just exactly like the Senator from Wy oming is talking about.  ",1990
537,1221,7,Mr. WALLOP., Will  yield for just a question?  ,1990
538,1221,7,Mr. HATCH.," If I could just finish  my statement, because I  think I can  make it clear. This legislation reflects  the fact that AIDS is not just affect ing citizens in urban areas where in  the past public attention has been fo cused. But AIDS has penetrated rural  America.  From figures from the Centers for  Disease Control from 1989, show that  AIDS increased at a rate of 5 percent  in metropolitan areas, but in nonme tropolitan areas it increased at a rate  of 37 percent. We are concerned about  that in this bill.  True; Wyoming, because  it has a  minimum number of AIDS cases re ported, gets  less money. It gets the  minimum amount of money. But even  that amount of money will not take  care of the AIDS problem that they  have  in  their State. Nor will  the  amount of money that we give to all  the other States. We are trying to do  the best we can within budgetary con straints  to do something about  this  horrendous problem.  I want to make it clear it is not just  13 cases. There were 22 new cases of  AIDS  in Wyoming  in 1989  through  1990.  ",1990
539,1221,7,Mr. KENNEDY., Will  yield for a question?  ,1990
540,1221,7,Mr. HATCH.," Yes,  yield.  ",1990
541,1221,7,Mr. KENNEDY.," Does the Senator  not agree with me that the five exam ples that were proposed by the Sena tor from Wyoming are basically just  options? There  is no requirement in  this legislation that requires the State  of Wyoming to implement every one  of  those  different  proposals. That  flexibility  is left up to the State of  Wyoming. They  have  30-odd  cases  that are there in Wyoming. The mini mum provided is $100,000. The public  health officials in Wyoming may say  let us provide the AZT and that can be  it. That is meeting the requirements  under this legislation.  the Senator  I am happy  to  I was concerned earlier in the course  of  the debate when  they  said we  cannot use all the $100,000 and later  in the debate they say,  look,  this is  just a pitiful amount of resources and  then to suggest that we are putting in  five different  requirements. That  is  not in the legislation.  Does the Senator not agree with me  that  those particular provisions are  basically to guide the States in possi bly areas where those resources can be  used?  ",1990
542,1221,7,Mr. HATCH., I do agree.  ,1990
543,1221,7,Mr. KENNEDY.," Under this legisla tion,  if the State health authorities  said that this should be used just for  AZT or counseling or some visiting  nurse programs, that would certainly  meet the requirements.  So I think we want to disabuse our  colleagues of the idea that we have es tablished some rigid kinds of require ments under the legislation, because  they just are not there.  ",1990
544,1221,7,Mr. HATCH.,"  I  think  the distin guished Senator from Massachusetts  has said it appropriately. We tried to  make this bill as nonintrusive as we  can and tried to give the States flexi bility.  I have to correct my earlier remark.  I said in 1989 through 1990 there were  22 new cases of AIDS. It was from  1988 up to now there are 22 new cases  of AIDS. This according to the surveil lance report for Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta.  In fact, I will just read table l, which  says ""AIDS cases and annual rates per  100,000 population, by State, reported  April 1988 through March 1989, April  1989 through March 1990; and cumu lative totals, by State and age group,  through March 1990."" From 1980  to  March 30,  1990,  there are  22  new  cases. The Senator  is  correct  that  there are 32 cases of adults and adoles cents cumulative totals since we have  been keeping track of these things.  The point I am making is that Wyo ming needs this money for the AIDS  problem. We do not want to take away  from the thrust of this bill. It will not  be enough support even at that, but it  is the best we can do under budgetary  constraints. The amount we are giving  to these large cities will not be enough  to really solve their difficulties but it  is certainly going to alleviate to the  best of our ability a lot of the prob lems.  I caution the distinguished Senator  from Wyoming that what he wants to  do sounds good, but his people out  there in Wyoming are not going to feel  very good without receiving at least a  minimum amount under this bill for  their AIDS problem. They will not  want  to use  it,  it seems  to me,  for  other purposes.  One of the major reasons for  the  dramatic 37 percent increase in AIDS  in rural America is that people with  AIDS are returning from the cities to  their families in the small towns and  rural areas to live until they die.  If we made an exception for Wyo ming in this bill, does that mean the  people from Wyoming who have AIDS  are going to go to other States that  are nearby that are going to accept  this money? It would be preferable for  us to raise the additional moneys that  the Senator from Wyoming needs in  the areas of Alzheimer's, cardiovascu lar disease,  respiratory problems, or  whatever else, and put them in appro priate bills  to solve  those problems.  We are willing to do that.  I  think we have been doing  that.  There have been omnibus health bills  almost every year that I have been on  the Labor Committee. I know, because  when I was chairman of the commit tee we would include 9 or 10 bills at  the end of each session of the Con gress in one omnibus health bill and  an Alzheimer's bill was one of them.  We are doing work in this area.  I do not want to prolong this. I think  we ought to vote on this and let the  Senate work its will. My recommenda tion is to let this bill be for what it is  supposed  to be. Yes, we have  taken  into  consideration  the needs of 13  cities with  the  largest numbers of  AIDS cases, but also half of the money  is  for community-based services,  in cluding home health care and includ ing care for AIDS patients  in rural  communities.  I think we are going to find that the  bill will work better if we do not try to  put exceptions in it at this particular  point and take away any amount of  money from  the purpose of helping  with AIDS.  There is not one State that gets this  money that will not be able to use it  on their AIDS problem. There is not  one State where the money is going to  be everything they need to solve the  problem. But all States will benefit if  we pass this bill and move forward so  that we can literally make a dent in  what really is going on in our country  with regard to AIDS.  I am prepared to vote.

548,1234,7,Mr. ARMSTONG., Of course.  ,1990
549,1234,7,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I want  to compliment  the Senator  for his  willingness to do that because I think  the Kennedy amendment is basically a  good amendment. What he is saying is  we will leave it up to the States as to  how  they handle  these matters and  then he provides for a contact tracing  approach for the States to choose. He  does not make it mandatory. He leaves  it in their discretion.  I believe  this is probably the best  step we can take now because there is  still a  tremendous argument on the  other side that people will be afraid to  come in for testing if we make this too  onerous. I, at least, would like to look  at what  the best approach may be.  Over the next year we can look to see  how it does work and see if people will  come in. The one thing that is going to  entice them in for testing is going to  be the fact they are going to be able to  get treatment and care.  So I personally would like to appeal  to the distinguished Senator from Col orado and tell him that I appreciate,  first of all, that he is willing to accept  these two amendments, and so am I,  and that he is willing to let this sit  overnight and see if he feels that the  Kennedy amendment will be enough  for this year.  I would be very appreciative of the  idea of accepting  these amendments  and letting this matter be reconsidered  overnight with all of us looking at it in  good faith to see where we are going  from there.

551,1234,7,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I ap preciate both the concern that I know  the Senator from Colorado has on this  particular issue and the comments of  the Senator from Utah.  This is, as we have known even in  the brief discussion here and at other  times,  an  enormously  complicated  issue. There  is  justification for con cern on all sides of this issue, and it is  a difficult call. It is difficult to argue  against doing the utmost in terms of  partner notifications. Certainly, there  is a compelling case for that.  There is also  the practical reality,  Mr. President,  that when you move  from going from an anonymous type  of testing even into a confidential type  of  testing, we  have  seen dramatic  changes in results. I understand the  State of Colorado has just altered and  changed its program to facilitate anon ymous testing. What we have seen is  when we have the anonymous testing,  there has been a significant increase  in participation in various testing pro grams. Even when you have confiden tiality protections in some instances,  there has been a general decline  in  participation. That has been the medi cal results.  So if you have a decline of  those  who are at the greatest risk, even if  you have partnership notification, in  terms of a public health question, you  have  to ask are you  reaching more  people that way or through the way  we are attempting to devise,  that is  the greatest degree of  flexibility  in  terms of the States so that in different  parts of the States they can fashion  ",1990
552,1260,7,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce a joint resolution to  commemorate the 50th anniversary of  the National Federation of the Blind.  The National  Federation  of  the  Blind was  founded  in Wilkes-Barre,  PA, on November 16, 1940 and is the  largest organization of  the blind  in  America. It has a membership of over  50,000 is organized in every State and  the District of Columbia, and has local  chapters in almost every community.  Since  its inception,  the purpose of  the federation has been to achieve se curity, equality, and opportunity for  the blind, as well as serving as a vehi cle for self expression of the blind.  National recognition of the 50th an niversary of the National Federation  'lf  the Blind will  also  honor  the  memory of  its founder, Dr. Jacobus  tenBroek. Blind himself, Dr. tenBroek  was a noted scholar of constitutional  law and legal history at the University  of California at Berkeley during the  1950's and 1960's. He pioneered  the  philosophy  that  blindness  was  a  ""normal characteristic,"" and it is not  any more limiting to a person than a  thousand other conditions. His exem plary work in the field of constitution al  law and  legal history personified  this  philosophy  and  improved  the  public image of blindness.  For 28 years, Dr. tenBroek was the  able  leader of  the organized blind  movement in this country and around  the world. In 1968 Dr. Kenneth Jerni gan succeeded him, first as president  and later as executive director of the  National  Federation  of  the Blind.  Through the inspiration and ability of  these exceptional  leaders  the public  perception of blindness has improved  over the past 50 years. The f edera tion's goal, ""changing what it means  to be blind,"" is now coming true.  Mr. President,  the  lOlst Congress  marks a watershed in the fight of the  disabled and blind persons to gain re spect and independence. Last fall, the  Senate passed the Americans with Dis abilities Act and I hope Mr. President,  that the House of Representatives will  soon follow so that we may enact this  important legislation into law.  Mr. President,  there are scores of  talented blind individuals who are not  seeking assistance, but simply an op portunity to become productive mem bers of our society. The National Fed eration of the Blind's programs help  blind  people  to  become  productive  members  of  society.  It  is  for  this  ",1990
553,1273,7,Mr.  SASSER.," Mr.  President,  I  hereby submit to the Senate the latest  budget scorekeeping report for fiscal  year 1990, prepared by the Congres sional Budget Office  in  response  to  section 308(b) of  the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This  report was prepared consistent with  standard  scorekeeping  conventions.  This report also serves as the score keeping report for the purposes of sec tion 311 of the Budget Act.  This report shows that current level  spending is under the budget resolu tion by $3.5 billion in budget author ity, and over the budget resolution by  $4 billion in outlays. Current level is  under the revenue floor by $5.2 billion.  The current estimate of the deficit  for purposes of calculating the maxi mum deficit  amount under  section  3ll<a> of the Budget Act is $114.6 bil lion, $14.6 billion above the maximum  deficit amount for 1990 of $100 billion.

CHAIRMAN: The attached report  shows the effects of Congressional action on  the budget for fiscal year 1990 and is cur rent through May 11, 1990. The estimates of  budget authority, outlays, and revenues are  consistent with the technical and economic  assumptions of the 1990 Concurrent Resolu tion on the Budget CH. Con. Res. 106>. This  report  is submitted under Section 308Cb>  and in aid of Section 311 of the Congres sional Budget Act, as amended, and meets  the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of  Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the 1986 First  Concurrent Resolution on the Budget.  Since my last report, dated May 7, 1990,  the Congress has cleared for the President's  signature the Amtrak Reauthorization and  Improvement Act, H.R. 2364.

554,1286,7,Mr.  ROTH.," Mr.  Speaker, more  Americans are killed  in  the Philip pines, and the Philippine Government  does nothing. No one is apprehended  nor punished. There is nothing new in  that.  I have a question: we have 40,000  Americans in the Philippines to pro tect the Philippines. Protect the Phil ippines  from who?  If the American  people ever get  the truth about  the  hundreds of millions,  the billions we  are pumping  into the Philippines  to  keep  these unneeded bases,  they are  going to be totally outraged and total ly incensed. The Philippine people do  not want nor need  the bases. The  American people do not want nor need  the bases.  It is time to live in the 21st century.  It is time to save billions. It is time to  start a new page in history. It is time  to do the will of the people. It is time  to close the bases in the Philippines.  THE REALITY OF THE BUDGET,  TAXES, AND SPENDING CUTS  <Mr. DORGAN  of North Dakota  asked and was given permission to ad dress the House for 1 minute and to  revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota. Mr.  Speaker,  reality  is knocking at  the  front door of the White House. This  intrusion in a fiscal policy dreamland  comes from  radically bloated budget  deficit projections,  a  result  in part  from a softening economy, and in part  from the exploding cost of the savings  and  loan  industry scandal  that has  rocked this country.  The talk now of budget deficit sum mits,  taxes, and spending cuts  is  a  grim reminder of both a fiscal policy  desperately off track and, in the case  of the savings and loan industry mess,  of an administration  that  failed  to  govern effectively resulting in perhaps  the costliest  financial  failure  in  the  history of America.  Those who assumed  their posts  in  the Reagan administration during the  1980's, and who were part of the team  to  ""get  government  off America's  back,""  created  a  type of  economic  casino in which the fat cats were gorg ing, playing  their speculative games  while  the American  taxpayers were  being set up to pay for the losses.  If ever  there's  a  lesson describing  the need for careful government regu lation in sensitive industries such as fi nancial  industries,  that  lesson came  from  the incompetence of the 1980's  when the American people were stolen  blind and a good number of the so called regulators were driving the get away car.  The cost of the savings and loan in dustry bailout  is  now  estimated by  some to be over $300 billion. Is it any  wonder that the President and others  have finally decided it is now time for  some sober discussion a  ut how to fix  this country's  fiscal policy mess? Let  us hope it is not too late, and let us  hope as we fix this mess, we prevent  the savings and  loan bailout scandal  and others like it from ever occurring  again.  D 1220  OVERALL GOAL OF LIMITING  SPECIAL INTERESTS  <Mr. WALSH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1990
555,1286,7,Mr. WALSH.," Mr. Speaker, as we are  all aware, the preamble of our Consti tution begins with the following three  words, ""We the people     .""  It does not begin with, ""We the na tional federation of     .""  It does not begin with,  ""We  American association of     .""  It does not begin with,  ""We  union of amalgamated       ""  It simply  reads,  ""We  the  people  ... ""  the  the  We have been charged by our con stituents through their votes, to repre sent their concerns and interests, and  to do the business of this Nation.  However, the American people have  come to believe that special interests  have  replaced  their  interests. That  any  influence  that  they might have  had in the voting booth is lost at polit ical fund raisers.  A former Democratic colleague was  quoted in the book, ""Honest Graft,"" as  saying, with  respect  to  the current  state of campaign  financing,  and  I  quote, ""The process buys you out.""  I am aware of the fact that it takes  more  than a  firm handshake and a  nice smile to mount an effective cam paign. But we must begin the neces sary dialog between the respective par ties to correct the problems affecting  the system.  Effective  campaign  reform must  remove any semblance of impropriety  by those who currently serve, and pro vide  a  competitive  environment  for  those who seek to serve in this body.  I believe the American people want  reform now.  ""LIPSERVICE"" TERMED A  DISSERVICE  <Mr. VISCLOSKY  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1990
556,1286,7,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  it  used to be that we only had one pair  of lips to read.  Now, with the budget summit, there  are so many lips-I don't know whose  to read.  President Bush says: ""There are no  preconditions, and  that's the way  it  is.""  Then, a  ""senior White House offi cial"" says: ""I emphasize it is our pre rogative to say noI emphasize that  no.""  Then, the President's press secretary  says: ""The 'senior White House offi cial' is 'crazy.'""  ",1990
557,1299,7,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  CMr. FEIGHAN], who is a member of the  committee  and  a  leader on human  rights.  ",1990
558,1299,7,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in strong support of House Resolution  365 regarding the human rights situa tion  in Cuba. Today,  Fidel Castro  stands alone as  the only dictator  in  Latin America. In a year that has been  marked  by  democratic  openings  around the world,  the Cuban regime  has  clung  to  its  singular  hold  on  power, denying its citizens the right to  change  their government,  to  speak  freely,  to associate  freely,  to  travel  freely-in short, to enjoy basic human  rights.  The resolution focuses particular at tention on the plight of Cuban human  rights monitors who have been arrest ed and detained by the Cuban authori ties. Last April,  five members of the  Cuban Human Rights Party were ar rested for announcing a demonstration  aimed at calling for glasnost in Cuba  during the visit of Soviet leader, Mik hail Gorbachev. According  to  the  State  Department's  human  rights  report, the Human Rights Party lead ers were held  in  incommunicado de tention for 3 days,  tried in a closed  proceeding and convicted of ""illegal  association."" Amnesty  International  has criticized the Cuban Government  for  trying Cuban  citizens  for  the  peaceful expression of their views.  The resolution before us condemns  the Government of Cuba for engaging  in a consistent pattern of gross viola tions  of  internationally-recognized  human  rights  against  the  Cuban  people and deplores the continued sys tematic harassment of Cuban human  rights activists.  I want to commend the sponsor of  the  resolution,  the gentleman  from  New Jersey CMr. SMITH], as well as my  subcommittee chairman,  the gentle man from Pennsylvania [Mr. YATRON],  and my full committee chairman, the  gentleman from Florida CMr. FASCELL]  for  their  continuing  leadership  on  human rights concerns  in Cuba and  around the world.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  I  yield 3 minutes  to  the gentleman  from California [Mr. LAGOMARSINO].  ",1990
559,1299,7,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  as an original cosponsor of House Res olution 381,  I want to commend my  colleague and good friend on the For eign Affairs Committee, Mr. CHRISTO PHER SMITH, for his leadership on this  issue.  This resolution condemns  the gov ernment of Fidel Castro for its consist ent  pattern  of  gross  violations  of  human  rights  against  the  Cuban  people.  Those of us who have followed close ly events in Cuba find particularly repugnant Castro's total disregard  for  the protection of civil  liberties and  basic human rights of  those  individ uals who  testified before  the Cuba  working group of  the U.N. Human  Rights Commission.  After the United States finally suc ceeded in getting United Nations ap proval in 1988 for a review of human  rights practices  in Cuba-with Con gressman SMITH playing an influential  role in that effort-the government of  Fidel Castro yielded  to  international  pressure and allowed the U.N. delega tion to go to Cuba. They were prom ised free and unhindered access to the  people of Cuba and were also assured  that those Cubans who presented tes timony  to  the U .N. working group  would not be punished.  The outcome of the U.N. review pro duced little in the way of condemna tion of Castro's human  rights prac tices, but Castro made sure that those  cooperating with  the U.N. working  group were made  to suffer. Many of  those human rights defenders in Cuba  interviewed were  then punished by  Castro with  imprisonment,  harass ment or intimidation.  Although  some  diehard  Castro  apologists refuse  to acknowledge the  historical  pattern of human  rights  abuses and  repression of  the Cuban  people,  one  particularly  telling  ac count of years of torture and punish ment  is  contained  in  the  book  ""Against All Hope"", written by Ar mando Valladares. His book depicting  his 22  years  in Cuban prisons  is  a  scathing indictment of human rights  abuses by the Castro regime. In a way,  it was poetic  justice  that Armando  Valladares was leading the U.S. dele gation  to  the U.N. Commission on  Human Rights when the decision was  taken to investigate Cuba.  Castro's totalitarian regime is virtu ally  isolated  now  that  democratic  changes  are  sweeping  through  the  world. His  efforts  to maintain  his  power and control over the people of  Cuba are reaching ever more desper ate proportions as witnessed by his  feeble attempts with reprisals against  Radio Marti and TV Marti.  It is imperative that we in the Con gress forcefully and convincingly con demn  the orchestrated campaign of  terror carried out by Castro against  those who seek  justice for  those de f ending human rights in Cuba.  I urge my colleagues  to give  their  strong support  to House Resolution  381, condemning Castro and the Gov ernment of Cuba  for human  rights  abuses.  D 1350  ",1990
560,1299,7,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from New  Mexico  [Mr. RICHARDSON], who has  been  a  strong supporter of human  rights around the world.  ",1990
561,1299,7,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker,  first  I want to commend the gentle man from New Jersey [Mr. SMITH] for  this strong resolution, and the gentle man from Pennsylvania [Mr. YATRON],  who is a champion of human rights ev erywhere in the world and has had an  outstanding record in this area. Lastly,  Mr. Speaker,  I would commend our  subcommittee chairman,  the gentle man from Florida CMr. FASCELL], who  is a true champion of human rights in  this hemisphere and who has been in volved with this issue probably longer  than most.  Why  is  this  resolution  important?  Well, first of all, it sends a signal that  the U.S. Congress is sending a message  that we will not condone human rights  violations by governments on the right  and on the left. In this case, it is Fidel  Castro. Human rights is not one of his  strong  areas.  The United Nations  sends some monitors down to investi gate human rights, and the United Na tions  is probably  the most objective  kind of monitoring group that Fidel  Castro could possibly have. And what  does he do? He throws them out, and  then he jails those who talk to them.  This is really intolerable, Mr. Speak er. Artists, cultural people, and politi cians from the left and from the right  condemn these acts, and they make no  sense.  I have not always agreed with our  foreign policy toward Cuba. I think we  have to have some kind of a dialog and  negotiation, not one that gives Fidel  Castro anything, but I think we would  be able to deal with issues of family re unification and other human  rights  issues  in  the hemisphere  if we had  some kind of dialog and not a policy of  isolation.  That, however, does not obscure the  fact  that Fidel Castro  is  probably  right now,  along with  a  couple of  others, one of the worst human rights  violators in the world. He ranks maybe  with the gentleman from Albania and  maybe  the  gentleman  from North  Korea and maybe others that I have  failed to mention. But here clearly is a  resolution that says we condemn these  practices and we will not stand for  them.  A  lot of people read  these resolu tions. Some people ask, ""What does a  sense-of-Congress resolution mean?"" It  simply means, first of all, hope to a lot  of people. It says that the U.S. Con gress has gone on record. Second,  it  recognizes the people on the minority  side who have worked on this issue for  many  years,  and  I  see  them here  among my colleagues.  I see  the new  Member from Miami,  the gentleman  from New Jersey CMr. SMITH], who  serves on the Human Rights Commis sion, and the gentleman from Pennsyl vania CMr. YATRON], who probably has  held a hearing a week since he has  ",1990

566,1312,7,Mr. SKEEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in support of House Joint Reso lution 508, a bill which designates the  month of May as Take Pride in Amer ica Month. I appreciate the support of  the gentleman  from California  [Mr.  MILLER]  for his help  in passing this  resolution.  As American citizens we own almost  40-percent of our country. These lands  including  forest, parks, wildlife pre serves,  beaches,  city  parks,  play gounds, and historic monuments are  managed by Federal, State, and local  government agencies.  Although most people take pride in  our la.nds, others act as  if the lands  belong to ""everyone"" and ""no one"" has  the responsibility to care for them.  Unfortunately, many of  these na tional  treasures have been subjected  to  careless misuses  and  deliberate  abuse by visitors to these sites. Some  of the abuses are malicious and bla tantly destructive, like defacing a stat ute in a public park.  Other actions are thoughtless behav ior, such as littering, or plucking flow ers  from  community  flowerbeds.  Either way, the costs are significant.  And sadly, some of the damage is  ir reparable. In fact, more than 80-per cent of  the prehistoric  ruins  in  the  Southwest  have  been  vandalized,  looted or damaged. And the National  Park Service  reports  that vandalism  costs  park  and  recreation  agencies  more than $50 million per year.  As  this Nation  has  grown  and  become more industrialized and urban ized, many people have forgotten or  never learned about how  to care for  the land and leave it better for those  who follow. That is the primary goal  of the ""Take Pride in America"" cam paigna partnership of public and pri vate organizations committed to edu cating our country's citizens on  the  wise use of the resources that belong  to all Americans. The ""Take Pride""  program seeks to promote stewardship  of our public lands, artifacts and his torical monuments.  In every State, volunteers are  in volved in a broad spectrum of grass roots activities including outdoor stew ardship  and  self-policing  programs,  and hotlines to report vandalism, wild life poaching, theft and other destruc tive  ~ctivities. Others help care  for  parks,  highways,  trails,  shorelines,  campsites  and playgrounds  through  cleanup, maintenance and general as sistance when needed.  It is that kind of volunteer support  that ""Take Pride in America"" month  will salute. I'm pleased that a majority  of this distinguished body has taken  this moment to recognize the efforts  of the thousands of volunteers in the  ""Take Pride"" program, by declaring the  month of May  as  ""Take Pride  in  America"" month.  Mr. Speaker, one of the daily news papers in my district, the Alamogordo  Daily News, recently wrote an editori al in support of ""Take Pride in Amer ica"" month, and explained activities of  citizens of Otero County in support of  the ""Take Pride"" program. I include it  for the RECORD.  Americans have been blessed with a  beautiful, abundant  land and a  rich  cultural  heritage.  If future  genera tions are to share in these blessings,  we must take an active role in preserv ing them.  [From the Alamogordo <NM> Daily News,  Mar. 27, 19901  ""IT'S TIME TO TAKE CARE OF TREASURES""  It's no secret that Otero County is rich in  natural treasure. The mountains, forest and  the White Sands make Otero rich in a spe cial way.  Many  congressmen,  including Rep.  Joe  Skeen, are trying to spur Americans to pro tect  the natural  treasure in Otero and  in  the rest of the nation. A joint resolution is  being introduced  in Congress to make the  month of May  ""Take Pride  in America""  month.  ""Americans  have  been  blessed with  a  beautiful, abundant land and a rich cultural  heritage,"" said Skeen. ""If future generations  are to share in these blessings, we must take  an active role in preserving them.""  Many of our national treasures, according  to Skeen, have been subjected  to careless  misuses and deliberate abuse by visitors to  these sites. Some of these abuses are mali cious and blatantly destructive, like defac ing a statue in a public park. Other actions  are thoughtless behavior, such as littering,  or plucking flowers from community flower beds.  Skeen also reminds us that more than 200  incidents  of  archaeological  vandalism  to  U.S. Forest Service land were documented  in 1985 alone. The National Park Service re ports that vandalism costs park and recre ational agencies more than $50 million per  year.  Skeen says ""Take Pride in America"" pro motes a partnership of public and private  organizations committed  to educating our  country's citizens on the wise use of the re sources that belong to all Americans.  Several groups  in Otero are already  in volved in projects to preserve our resources.  ""Take Pride in America"" has the potential  to urge others to get involved in preserving  our national  treasures.  It may also help  remind those careless in the past to be more  responsible with  those  treasures  in  the  future.  ",1990
567,1312,7,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker,  last  month, millions of Americans celebrated Earth  Day. The Take Pride  in America  resolution,  House Joint Resolution 508, also celebrates  the love we have for this wonderful land.  People across  the country make sacrifices  everyday in  the name of protecting the envi ronment.  Indeed,  our Nation,  blessed with  some of the world's natural  treasures, has a  rich history of natural resource protection and  preservation.  Now, as we approach  the next century,  large-scale consumer conservation and  recy cling movements are helping to ease burdens  on our Nation's natural  resources.  It  is my  hope  that protection of sensitive areas and  environmental activism will continue  to gain  popular support.  I receive  letters  from proud  Americans hailing from all parts of this great  country who are committed to preserving our  natural heritage.  Mr. Speaker, we have much to be thankful  for,  from  the natural wonders within our bor ders to the willingness of the American public  to step in and help preserve them.  I join my colleagues in taking pride in Amer ica.  D 1520  ",1990

580,1325,7,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," This  young man could have accepted a plea  offer and avoided the death penalty. I  am sure that the reason he did not  was because his lawyer did not under stand the mental limitations and did  not help him understand the benefits  of a plea, particularly since he was not  going to receive any advocacy at the  trial.  The lawyers also let him decide by  himself  in open court, with no ad vanced preparation, whether to waive  a jury sentencing and be sentenced by  the judge. He had no understanding of  what his choice was. Finally he said,  and, turning to the judge, he said, ""I  pick you,"" and  the  judge sentenced  him to death.  Mr. Speaker,  this young man was  not sentenced to death because he had  committed the worst crime. The State  acknowledged that by offering him a  death  sentence. He was  really  sen tenced  to death because he had the  worst lawyers.  0 1630  Over 50 years ago in the case of the  Scottsboro Boys in Alabama, the Su preme Court said that as a matter of  constitutional  law  that we would no  longer sentence poor people to death  without first providing  them compe tent legal representation, yet the case  that I have just described, Mr. Speak er,  illustrates  that promise has not  been fulfilled.  Last year, in the same State where  the  trial of the Scottsboro Boys oc curred, a capital  trial had  to be de layed for a day in midtrial because the  defense lawyer was drunk. He was held  in contempt and sent to jail. The next  morning he and his client were both  produced from jail, the trial resumed,  and the death penalty imposed a few  days later.  Inadequate legal representation does  not occur in just a few capita,} cases. It  is pervasive in the death belt States of  the South. There are several reasons,  but the primary one is money.  Alabama  limits  compensation  for  out-of-court representation to $20 per  hour, with a limit of $1,000. One rare  Alabama case where  two  lawyers de voted 264 and 188 hours respectively  to  out-of-court  representation.  they  were still paid $1,000 each.  Mississippi and Arkansas  limit  the  total compensation of defense counsel  in capital cases to $1,000. South Caro lina pays $10 per hour up to a limit of  $1,500.  One  judicial  circuit  in  Georgia  awarded capital cases  to  the  lowest  bidder.  Total fee awards of from $2,500  $5,000 are not unusual.  In many Southern States a  lawyer  devotes 800  to 1,000 hours to do an  to  ",1990
581,1468,7,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Speaker, as chairman of  the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Educa tion,  I am today introducing the Arts, Human ities and Museums Amendments of 1990, a  bill to reauthorize the National Endowment for  the Arts, the National Endowment for the Hu manities, and  the  Institute of Museum Serv ices. This  is President Bush's proposal.  It  is  his  reauthorization  suggestion  for  the  three  agencies which  represent  this Government's  primary support  for  the enhancement of our  Nation's cultural life.  This bill makes few changes in current law  and represents the administration's faith in the  effort set  into place a quarter of a century  ago. It is an affirmation of faith in the principle  that private citizens should make decisions  about public support of the arts and human ities.  It is an affirmation of the overall record  of these agencies in their work to enlarge and  enhance the cultural life of our Nation. It is a  faith I share.  In considering  this proposal, we may  find  that there are ways in which we can improve  the  system  by which  these  decisions are  made, and we may  find other ways  to en hance the operations of the agencies. As we  prepare to mark up  this bill, all of us remain  open  to suggestions  for  improving upon  this  basic proposal.  Nevertheless,  I am pleased  today to  intro duce the President's bill to reauthorize the Na tional Endowments  for  the Arts and Human ities and  the  Institute of Museum Services.  I  intend to use this bill as the basis for our re authorization efforts. I commend the President  and  those whom he has appointed  to direct  these agencies  for  their steadfast  leadership  during this most difficult and chilling time.  A TRIBUTE TO CAMP SUNSHINE  HON.GEORGE(BUDDY)DARDEN  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 15, 1990  ",1990
582,1468,7,Mr. DARDEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to bring  to  the attention of my colleagues  the good  work of Camp Sunshine  in Georgia. Camp  Sunshine is a camp for children with cancer,  and  it has served  the youth of Georgia  for  almost a decade. This camp is  like no other.  Camp Sunshine provides an opportunity  for  children with cancer to get away from the ev eryday anxiety and stress that most children,  indeed most adults, will  never know. This  camp  is an experience which  these children  eagerly anticipate each year.  It is a bright ray  or hope in  lives that could easily be clouded  by  the overwhelming realities of the physical  and emotional challenge  to overcome hope lessness.  But Camp Sunshine  is a special place. A  visit  to  this camp would convince you  that  these young campers have a unique appreciaMay 15, 1990  tion of the joy of living. Swimming, horseback  riding, singing, crafts, games, and many other  traditional camp activities are pursued with en thusiasm that can be matched nowhere else.  Other than the summer camp, Camp Sunshine  provides activities throughout the year.  Recently I met with a group of Camp Sun shine kids visiting  the Capitol. These young  people were seeing this great city, as they are  seeing  life  itself, with an attitude of wonder ment and curiosity that is contagious. I eagerly  look forward to the annual visit of Camp Sun shine. This  year's  visitors were: Trent Al dredge, Ryan Bacon, Dee Jay Beck, Bryan  Bridges, David Bryant, Dan Crockett, DeAnna  Drain, Barbara Griffin, Kristin Groom, Holly  Hendrix, Andres  Jimenez, David Kenemer,  John Kimsey, Wendell Long, Marcus Missa vage, Robrico Phillips, Ramon Scott, Karl  Smart, Stephanie Taylor, Fukima Tigner, Molly  Wheatley, Neil White, and Dixie Yandle.  The women and men who make this camp  a  reality are not well known, but  they are  heroes  to  the children and  their  families.  I  commend  the  cochairman  of Camp  Sun shine's board, Dorothy H. Jordan and William  B. Schwartz, Jr., and the entire board of direc tors  as well  as  the  officers: William  B.  Schwartz  Ill, Mary Beth Fain, Mo Thrash,  Thomas Beard, and executive director Sally  Hale.  Mr. Speaker, in closing I want to include the  following  lines  from Camp Sunshine's 1989  publication, Sunny Daze:  Camp Sunshine is a place filled with kind  words,  reassuring hugs and warm smiles.  Where the pain you've known and the con flict you've experienced give you strength to  walk through life facing each new situation  with courage and optimism. A place where  the lives you have touched and those that  have  touched yours are always a part of  you. An experience that leaves you some how better.  PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL  DAY  HON. GEORGE E. BROWN, JR.  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 15, 1990  ",1990
583,1468,7,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr. Speaker, May  13  through May 19  is National Police Week  and today is Peace Officers Memorial Day. As  you know, Congress is asked on a daily basis  to approve and promote commemorative days  for any number of  special  reasons. While  many of  the professions and occasions we  are asked to remember are truly worthy of the  honor, it would be hard to find a group more  worthy of note  than  the peace officers who  put their lives on the line every day.  I have  learned first hand how quiet, subur ban communities such as  those  I am privi leged to represent, are being infiltrated by the  violence and destruction of drugs, gangs, and  automatic weapons. One might expect orga nized violence in the large urban cities in our  country, but the drug trade and gang violence  have moved to center stage for most law en forcement officers no matter where  in our  country they work.

Is  CONSTITUTIONAL  TO  BAN  FLAG  OPPOSING A  AMENDMENT  BURNING  ",1990
586,10,11,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, Con gress will soon vote on an amendment  to  the Constitution  of  the United  States. The House of Representatives  is  expected  to vote  today.  If that  amendment is adopted it will mark the  first  time  in 200 years  that we will  have changed  the  first amendment,  the very cornerstone of our Bill of  Rights, engraved into our Constitution  and the heart of our political system  by Thomas  Jefferson  and George  Washington and other leaders, whose  ideas and  ideals have served us well  and have stood the test of time.  You might ask how could we even  consider tampering with the language  of the Bill of Rights. The short answer  is that we have been swept along by a  tide of anger at acts desecrating our  Nation's flag. I understand that anger  because I share it. I feel it too. I grew  up in a home where from an early age  I was  taught  to honor  the  flag  to  always display it properly, to protect it  from the elements, and to keep it from  touching the ground.  I read about its history, and studied  what it symbolized. I can never see our  flag pass without feeling a  sense of  pride and inspiration, and without re membering how many have risked and  indeed even given their lives to protect  the freedom it represents. Every time  I see scenes in the media of people dis honoring our flag I feel anger boil up  inside myself. If such an act took place  in my presence it would be very diffi cult for me  to restrain myself from  physically intervening to stop it. My  first reaction was to support this con stitutional amendment.  But just like many other Americans  who are angry about flag burning, I  stopped  to  think and began  to ask  myself some questions.  I asked myself,  if we should allow  the outrageous acts of a few attention  seeking  radicals  to drive us  to  the  action of tampering with the liberties  provided  in our Bill of Rights. As a  conservative who believes in changing  our government only with great care, I  asked myself if we should allow our  anger to lead us  to discard language  which has been in our Constitution for  200 years, strongly urged by Thomas  Jefferson and advocated by George  Washington in his first inaugural ad dress.  I began to worry that in the name of  protecting the flag, we were about to  chip away at the liberties for which it  stands and for which Americans have  fought and died.  I  realized  that we  cannot honor our flag if we do not pro tect the freedom it represents.  As I listened to the voices raised in  the national debate I realized that it is  not a debate that separates those who  love their country from those who do  ",1990
587,23,11,Mr. GLENN.," I yield myself 10 min utes.  Mr.  President,  the  distinguished  Senator from Kentucky a little while  ago quoted me as saying, ""When you  mention  the Hatch Act you batten  down the hatches, you go for the fox holes, you put the helmet on and ev erybody gets ready to hunker down.""  Because we are ""changing the Hatch  Act.""  We are modifying the Hatch Act to a  minor degree, as I see it. It is not a  repeal, as the Senator from Delaware  said. He kept using that in our debate  before, the 8 days of debate we had on  the floor.  This  is not a  repeal of the Hatch  Act. It is not, as the New York Times  in  their  little  editorial  today  said,  when  they  said  ""don't destroy  the  Hatch Act,"" which indicates repeal.  I was a little surprised to find that  institution that usually would be  in  the forefront of demanding that ex cessive restrictions on employees in or  out of the Government should not be  permitted to continue, and that free dom of speech, freedom of action, as  much as possible within some restric tions, should be permitted-I was a  little surprised to see the New York  Times coming down on the other side  of that one, as I read their editorial  today. But that is a little bit beside the  point.  Mr. President, when  the  lines get  drawn on the Hatch Act it seems we  cannot really suggest any changes, no  matter how minor, without being sub jected to a lot of criticism. H.R. 20, the  original H.R. 20, in the House, let me  clarify, was a repeal of the Hatch Act  de facto. It basically took all restric tions as far as raising money, running  for office, doing everything else.  But  that  is not  the bill we have  before us today. I must say that the  White House  comments made  ever  since we passed the bill here  in the  Senate, I think, have been addressing  the original H.R. 20, because I do not  see how they could really read the bill  that we passed here and still say the  things about the Hatch Act that they  said. This is a very modest proposal.  The legislative procedure was, H.R.  20 came over to us, we substituted the  Senate bill for it. So it is called H.R. 20  now but this is not the original H.R.  20 the White House keeps ref erring to.  This is not that kind of a bill. This is a  very modest bill. It developed in the  committee with a lot of bipartisan sup port.  What it does  is eliminate many of  the complicated and restrictive rulings  that presently govern the political ac tivities of Federal civilian and postal  employees. We held hearings on it in  1988 and 1989; we had 8 days of debate  here on the floor.  When we were in committee, much  of the testimony focused on the fact  that back  through  the years of  the  Hatch Act we had had  some 3,000  rules and regulations come up, many  of  them conflicting. So Federal em ployees do not have any  idea which  one to go with and which one not, be cause  they are conflicting. Most of  those were prior  to 1940. Some of  them were eliminated, but not all of  them. And there were all kinds of po litical activities that these rules and  regulations  applied  to. The  rulings  were confusing, illogical and in many  cases trivial.  I will tell my colleagues right now I  was lukewarm to Hatch Act changes  until we got into it and looked at it  and found out how ludicrous some of  these  things were and decided  that  simple fairness,  just plain old simple  ",1990
588,36,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Does  the Senator from New York wish to  speak?  Mr. D'AMATO. Thank  you  very  much, Mr President. Mr. President, I  was just speaking to Secretary Kemp  in an attempt to see if we could not  get some more agreement on this. It is  my understanding  that  this amend ment attempts to assist rural families.  Let me say that many times people  have a misconception of the State of  New York. They tend to think of it as  only New York City. They think of  our State-and I hate to be parochi al-as upstate being Westchester, not  recognizing  that there are 7 million  people who  live north and west of  Westchester. It is a far different State  than many perceive. It is not just the  high-rises of New York City, or the  mass transit systems, et cetera. We are  a great agricultural State, and we have  large expanses that are truly rural in  every sense.  I want to pay tribute to Senator Mc CONNELL for putting forth this amend ment so that the rural families pay an  affordable  rent. While  I may have  some reservations about all aspects of  it, it certainly is moving in the right  position. I think it is going to help the  plight of rural Americans who need af forable housing and, again, we often times  forget  about  that. We  think  these problems are concentrated  in  urban areas and suburban areas. That  happens not to be the case.  Farmers Home does an excellent job,  as the Senator from Kentucky has in dicated. Their default ratios as relates  to this program are less than 1 per cent. So we support this amendment.  The administration has no positions  on it, but I do, and the committee does  support this amendment on this side.  ",1990
589,36,11,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,"  Is  there further debate?  If there be no further debate,  the  question is on agreeing to the amend ment.  The  amendment  agreed to.  ",1990
590,36,11,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President,  I  move to reconsider the vote by which  the amendment was agreed to.  Mr. D'AMATO. I move to lay that  motion on the table.  The motion to lay on the table was  agreed to.  ",1990
591,36,11,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President,  I  believe  that Senator MACK may be  coming to the floor very soon to off er  his amendment relating to vouchers.

592,36,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from New York.  AMENDMENT NO. 2042 TO AMENDMENT NO. 2041  As  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, what  is the pending business?  ",1990
593,36,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  pending business  is amendment No.  2042 offered by the Senator from New  York.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr.  President,  I  mention that at this point in time be cause at some point in time, I believe  that we are going to have to deal with  this. I will ask that it be dealt with. It  has been pending since  last evening.  As long as we are making progress on  relevant  and germane  amendments,  this Senator is certainly not going to  impede or take time, but it may take  time and,  indeed,  it may be a  full  debate, as it relates to my apprehen sion that the FHA system is in trouble  now and that as every day goes by, it  becomes deeper in debt.  long  as we  are making mort gages-and I will cease my comments  as soon as one of the Senators who has  an amendment wants to present it, or  until or unless the distinguished man ager of  the bill wants  the floor  for  some purpose-as long as we continue  to make mortgages, about 3,500, give  or  take, a day,  in  the manner pre scribed under law now, we continue to  cost the taxpayers of America, depend ing upon whose formula you believe  may be accurate, millions of dollars a  day.  ",1990
594,36,11,Mr. CRANSTON., Will the Senator  yield?  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly.  ,1990
595,36,11,Mr. CRANSTON.,"  I  appreciate my  friend from New York yielding. Let me  just say one  thing and  then ask a  couple questions. First, every Senator  wishes to get the FHA on a sound, ac tuarial basis. We must do that; we will  do that. The administration wants it.  That is one of the three main points.  The question is how we do it. There  are some varying approaches in regard  to that.  I hope that the Senator from New  York will wait until we see  if  in a  meeting that I hope will occur  this  afternoon with Mr. Darman or his rep resentative and with Mr. Kemp and  his people and with Senator D'AMATO,  myself, and other Senators who are in terested, we may be able to work out a  common  agreement  on  how  to  go  about dealing with the FHA problem.  So I would like to ask the Senator,  as I have asked him already before, to  continue  to  delay  bringing  up  his  amendment until we  see  if we  can  work  out  an  agreement. Then we  might not have  controversy.  If he  brings up his amendment before we  have had that opportunity, there obvi ously will be a rather stiff debate and  some controversy.  Relevant to that, let me ask another  question. I  talked to Secretary Kemp  last night,  and  the consequence of  that was we had a staff meeting which  went on until 2 or 3 o'clock in  the  morning where much  progress was  made and some tentative agreements  reached  on  some major  and  some  lesser  issues. The hope was that we  would have a meeting  this morning  with a top person from OMB and Sec retary Kemp. It turned out that was  impossible, so Senators met. We are  hoping to have such a meeting this  afternoon to see if we can resolve the  remaining differences. I would like to  ask the Senator from New York if in  his phone conversation just now with  Secretary Kemp he received any clue  as  to whether  that meeting will  happen and when?  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, this  Senator has no information as it re lates to a meeting or rescheduling of a  meeting. In my conversation with the  Secretary, I  indicated to him that it  was my purpose to attempt to ascer tain what  areas  outstanding  there  were, if it looked like we could make  progress, and what were the problem  areas that we could address.  He basically indicated to me the ad ministration found that in the area of  any construction,  it had objection. I  asked him if he could not be more spe cific in making comments on the out lines of the agreement or compromise  that staff was working with until late  into the evening and has submitted to  HUD for their comments. He indicated  to me that the main point of conten tion, or at least a major point was still  the question of whether or not  the  housing bill would open the door to  new construction in a way which was  not acceptable to the administration.  He pointedly referred me to the con versation that we had with the head  of OMB, Mr. Darman, at which time  Mr. Darman indicated that the issue  of funding and the levels of funding  would fall into place, he felt, or had a  good opportunity of being achieved  and dealt with if the underlying issue  as it related to new construction was  dealt with.  I  think everybody  recognizes  that  the administration starts off with a  point and says no new construction,  but we recognize, in the area of negoti ations, obviously that that is not going  to be the case, that they would enter tain new construction under certain  limited cases, but it would have to be  tightly controlled. That is still an area  of open contention which has not been  solved.  ",1990
596,36,11,Mr. CRANSTON.," Will the Senator  yield on that point?  Mr. D'AMATO. I ask specifically for  the Secretary and for HUD to outline  those objections so that we could find  a vehicle by which to continue to move  the process, whether it be continued  ",1990
597,49,11,Mr. MACK.," There are scholars on  both sides who  indicate that in fact  these artificial barriers do exist and  that each one of them can force up  the cost of housing and as a  result  push millions of families out of the op portunity to afford their own home.  Just as a way of example, earlier this  month we held a conference in Tampa,  FL, on the affordable housing  issue.  One of the individuals who spoke at  that conference shared with us what  was called the affordability profile for  Hillsborough County.  I make two points from it. First, it  showed that if interest rates were to  drop from 10.5 percent to 8.5 percent,  some 31,000 additional families would  be able to afford a home of $68,000 in  value; or at the price of $60,000 an other 54,000 families-not individuals  but families-would be eligible to pur chase that home.  We also  saw  that as  the price of  housing-that is  if you could impact  the housing, if you reduce the cost of  housing by 15 percent, the number of  families eligible, again, would increase  by 32,000.  My point there is that I think each  of us needs to be aware of the fact  that while we may not be addressing  the question  of  affordable  housing  when we are dealing with a series of  other issues, the fact is that what we  have done through interest rates, envi ronmental regulation, building codes,  growth  management,  Davis-Bacon,  have an impact, driving up the cost of  the homes, and around the country we  are  forcing  people  away. We  are  making it almost impossible for them  to own their own home.  The  second  point. There  are  no  stereotypes  living  in public housing.  People living in public housing today  are young and old;  they are black;  they are white; they are educated and  they are uneducated; they are people  who have aspirations and those who  have no aspirations at all. In addition  to  that,  there are people who are  living there because, frankly, they do  not want  to give up. They are not  going  to  allow  the  community  in  which they are living to be taken over  by undesirables.  Meeting Reverend Washington  in  Orlando, again brings  that  to mind.  Reverend Washington was offered the  opportunity to leave this project that  was basically funded because of certifi cates,  project-based  certificates. He  would not leave. I asked him the ques tion, if your church was prepared to  build you  a  home  and move  your  family  from  that project  into your  own home, why would you not leave?  His response was he was not going to  give up. He was not going  to move  away. He was not going to desert the  children who lived in that project. He  felt that strongly.  So again I make the case that there  really  are  no  stereotypes  living  in  public housing. Oliver Hill would be  another example. Oliver Hill up  in  Tallahassee has the potential of being  another Bertha Gilkey  or Kimmy  Gray.  The third point, some issues need to  be revisited. In Jacksonville, FL, at a  meeting with  the  tenants of public  housing,  a  young,  very  large man,  stood up in the back of the room and  in essence pointed a finger at me and  said:  Senator.  the kinds of policies and  the  issues that you all are pursuing up in Wash ington are acting as a disincentive for me to  work as opposed to encouraging me to work.  I said, ""What do you mean by that?""  He said, ""my wife and I went out,  each of us got a part-time  job."" He  said, ""Do you know what happened?  The end result of getting a part-time  job was  that I had fewer dollars  to  take care of my children as a result of  working. What would you do?"" he said.  ""Would you work or would you not?""  There  is  the  issue of whether we  should be requiring people to pay 30  percent of their income toward public  housing. Some make the argument it  should be less than that. Some make  the argument there ought to be some  kind of transition period that would  allow people to accumulate funds so  that  they could move  toward home  ownership.  I  raise  the  issue  about  whether eligibility for public housing  or publicly assisted housing should be  50  percent  of median  income,  or  whether  it should be 80 percent of  median income.  At 80 percent of median income, you  in fact have a different environment  for the people to live in. There is a dif ferent society, if you will. There is an  opportunity for  role models for  the  children. So I  think those are some  issues at which we ought  to  take a  look.  The fourth point that I made was  that we spend too much time on the  issue of bricks and mortar, the idea of  building more  buildings  and  not  enough  time  on  people.  Secretary  Kemp has proposed the idea of Oper ation Bootstrap, which basically says  we should look at the housing and the  problems of housing in a much broad er perspective. We ought to  look at  ",1990

If you want a housing bill,  then do not allow the amendment that  the Senator from Florida put forth,  which simply gives flexibility to local  communities, which  this HOP Pro gram was supposed to be about, not be  passed.  ",1990
603,62,11,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  the Senate is not order.  ",1990
604,62,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  point of order  is well  taken. The  Senate is not order. The Senate will be  in order.  Mr. D'AMATO. To simply continue  to say by way of party discipline we  are going to vote a particular way be cause somehow we have developed a  philosophy that all of the funds that  are in the HOP Program are going to  be used for new construction and reha bilitation and that at no time will a  community have  the ability  to say,  look, we have a program, whether it be  emergency assistance program for the  homeless, a McKinney bill that we can  supplement, we can get more housing,  we can get more services by rental as sistance programs, and what we say is,  look, no discretion; your  town, your  country, your city, your local mayors,  all we give you is a pot of money and  all you can do is build, that is all. Let  me  tell  you  something,  then  this  whole thing is an exercise in futility,  our  saying  that we  are  going  to  streamline the categorical grants proCONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE  June 21, 1990  gram, that we are going  to put in a  HOP Program  so  that we  can get  those moneys  to  local,  State,  and  county officials and town officials so  they have their flexibility.

605,62,11,Mr. CRANSTON., Will  the Senator  yield on one point of fact?  Mr. D'AMATO. No. No. No.  ,1990
606,62,11,Mr. CRANSTON.," The Senator made  a misstatement of what would be the  circumstance.  Mr. D'AMATO. My good friend and  distinguished manager of the bill can  state it any way he wants. But let me  tell you what Secretary Kemp said in  a  letter:  ""Flexibility of HOP"" -and  this is the letter which I received in  which he indicates-I am not going to  take the time but to say that he does  not feel that the administration's pro posals basically, which would provide  flexibility for the use of vouchers, has  really been considered and that the  program is tilted too much for all con struction.  Now, we are not going to have a bill  if we  insist and say it has to be my  way. I tried to make that point. I tried  to argue, and  I have been arguing,  with  the  administration  that  they  should similarly allow  flexibility  for  new construction. It is pretty darned  hard that the administration should  allow flexibility for new construction  when my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle say that there should be  no flexibility in the HOP Program as  it relates to vouchers.  ",1990
607,62,11,Mr. SARBANES.," Will  yield?  Mr. D'AMATO. No. No. Let me say  this. The Secretary wrote to me in a  letter that we  received  just a  short  time ago, ""Flexibility of HOP."" This is  point 5. ""Senate Democrat proposals  don't permit vouchers as an eligible  use. We want HOP to include tenant based assistance as an eligible activi ty.""  I go on: ""In many  jurisdictions  vouchers  and  certificates  not  only  work but they are also the cheapest al ternative.""  Now, look, my friends.  ",1990
608,62,11,Mr. SARBANES., Will  the Senator  share the Secretary's letter with us?  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly.  ,1990
609,62,11,Mr. SARBANES.," I thank the Sena tor very much.  Mr. D'AMATO. Let me say this. If  we want a bill we are going to have to  make some accommodations. It seems  to me when we turn down this amend ment,  there may have been ways  to  protect  interests and modify  it, and  indeed the distinguished Senator from  Florida did that. He said he did not  want to see this be used as the vehicle  by which you take the present rental  assistance program, cut it down on one  side, and then say well, you can fill the  hole by using the HOP funds.  Again, we control the appropriations  process here as well. So if there are  any other safeguards to see that this is  not used as a vehicle to replace an exthe Senator  isting program  and  undermine  the  basis  of which HOP was  brought  about, fine, let us talk about it. Let us  have those amendments. Let us make  those suggestions. But to simply vote  this down at this point in time when  the administration is saying look, we  have serious problems, I think is one  of the easiest problems for us to deal.  There are about six or seven income  targets, for example, as it relates to  putting money and seeing to it that it  goes to those most in need. We have  not even addressed that. If we cannot  address  this problem, I am going to  suggest to you once again that we are  not going to have a housing bill, that  you can pass the bill maybe; that is if  colleagues on my side do not become  so exacerbated that they say the situa tion  is  intolerable, we will offer our  own amendments, and we will keep  here and talk and talk, or maybe it is  better to take it down.  I  would  suggest  that we  really  maybe  should  take  a  break,  and  should consider this. I do not see any  sense in going forward on this. If we  are going to by strength of party disci pline, let me tell you,  there are col leagues of mine on the other side who  wanted to vote for  this amendment,  who knew this amendment made good  sense. But you know there is party loy alty. There is party discipline. I under stand that. I respect that. But I have  to tell you if we want a bill, this is not  the time to do it.  ",1990
610,62,11,Mr. ARMSTRONG., Will the Sena tor yield to me for a moment?  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes.  ,1990
611,62,11,Mr. ARMSTRONG.,"  I  followed  in tently  the Senator's discussion  and  agree with everything he has said. But  I fear he was about to pass over too  lightly the point he was making. I just  want to encourage him to amplify it.  We have had what is tantamount to  a party  line vote. Our party  is on  record in favor of vouchers. That is  freedom of choice, giving the people  who are most affected a  chance at  least in some jurisdictions to spend the  money in a way that they think is in  their best interests.  The other party is on record in this  near party line vote in favor of con structing more public housing, more of  the kind of things that have proven to  be  such  a  scandalous  extravagance  over the years.  Personally, I would hope that when  the minority leader's motion is voted  on there would be some people on the  other side who would think not only  about the housing policy involved but  also about the politics, because I guess  candidates  for public office on  the  other party's ticket really would want  to think twice before they lock them selves  into being the party of more  public housing when the alternative is  choice and vouchers.  I thank my colleague for yielding.  ",1990

660,166,11,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may require.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  proposed constitutional amendment. I  believe that our Nation,  through  its  Government,  has  a  legitimate  and  vital interest in ensuring the physical  integrity of the emblem of our nation hood. The  flag holds an  important  place  in  the  life of our Nation.  stands as a symbol of our unity as a  Nation and a reminder of the sacrific es that millions have endured in order  to preserve our freedoms. This symbol ic and emotional bond between  the  people and their flag can be summed  up in one word: patriotism. Millions of  Americans have anguished over  the  Supreme Court cases of the past two  summers holding 5-4 statutory protec tion of the flag unconstitutional. No where has this concern been felt more  It  sharply  than  in my home State of  Texas, whose  flag protection statute  was overturned last summer in Texas  versus Johnson.  Beyond this symbolic and emotional  element, however, I believe that there  is an equally important national inter est in protecting the flag. In a real and  concrete sense, the display of the flag  of the United States is a demonstra tion of our Nation's identity, presence  and  resolve  to defend  its  sovereign  rights. This use of the flag as an ""inci dent of sovereignty"" is part of our Na tion's heritage. At home and abroad,  from small  town post offices  to the  Persian Gulf,  the  flag signifies and  embodies our national  identity. Our  Government, the custodian of the Na tion's values and heritage, must have  the authority to protect the flag from  physical desecration.  Now  that the Supreme Court has  spoken and has stated that this legiti mate national  interest  in protecting  the  physical  integrity  of  the  flag  cannot  be  achieved  by  statutory  means, I believe that it is appropriate  and  necessary  for  us  to  proceed  through the means of advancing the  constitutional amendment before us  today. In doing so, I hope that we will  not  lose sight of  the seriousness of  what we  are  dofn.g.  Proposing  an  amendment to our Constitution is not  a  task  to be  taken  lightly.  Indeed,  changing our national charter is one  of the most important and momentous  responsibilities we can perform, and it  is one  that has been accomplished  only rarely. Subsequent to the adop tion of the Bill of Rights in 1791, our  Constitution  has  been  subject  to  amendment only 16 times in the past  200 years.  I would hope that the Members of  this body and of the Congress will rec ognize  the importance of our action  and treat this process with the dignity  it deserves. It demeans both the Con stitution and the emblem of nation hood that we are seeking to protect to  use it as political fodder. It is unwor thy of the flag to describe it as just  some more  ammunition  for  a  30  second spot, and it is unworthy of us  as responsible elected officials to turn  this issue into a demagoguing contest.  Those who oppose this amendment  are just as patriotic as we who support  it. They fought just as long overseas;  they had just as many injuries; they  are just as patriotic. In this debate, let  us demonstrate once again to America  and to the world our dedication to and  reverence for democracy and the Con stitution which enshrines our most  hallowed  principles  by  which  we  govern ourselves.  I believe we can provide in our Con stitution the means to protect our flag  without  threatening or  diminishing  our devotion to freedom of speech and  the Bill of Rights. Millions of Ameri cans have fought and died to protect  our flag and our Constitution. These  two are not incompatible, they are one  and the same. This amendment guar antees the continued sanctity of the  flag and  the  freedoms  for which  it  stands. I urge approval of the amend ment.  It  D 1230  ",1990

662,166,11,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, at the  outset let me first pay my respects to  our  distinguished  colleague,  SONNY  MONTGOMERY,  cosponsor with me of  this proposed constitutional  amend ment, and the 169 of our colleagues  from both sides of the aisle who have  joined with us.  It has been one of the more reward ing aspects of my House career to see  such truly bipartisan support for this  constitutional amendment  to protect  our flag.  I stand here today not as the repre sentative of a political party or of an  ideology or a special interest, but as  one member of a bipartisan group of  millions of Americans.  Our  goal  is  to  protect  the  flag  through procedures established by the  Constitution itself.  We realize attempting to amend the  Constitution of the United States is a  solemn undertaking.  is a  process  that calls  for  the  people of the States, as well as their  Representatives and Senators in Con gress, to make a judgment.  It is therefore a process that is the  very antithesis of quick, unthinking,  emotional, political, response to a com plex problem.  As the Supreme Court has in effect  ruled  in United States versus Eich man,  it  is  the only process we now  have to protect the flag.  We have had the benefit of expert  testimony on this issue. Some tell us  we  should not amend  the Constitu tion. Editorials in most major newspa pers  condemn  the  constitutional  amendment, often in harsh terms.  Other experts say an amendment is  necessary and desirable.  We appreciate  the views of  these  learned men  and women. But our  system is one in which the ultimate  decision on such a grave matter is left  quite properly  in  the hands of  the  American people and their representa tives, not to a handful of experts.  And that is exactly why we believe  our constitutional amendment is nec essary and the process before us is ap propriate.  Let me first off er a brief look at the  events that have led us to this debate.  On  June  21,  1989,  the Supreme  Court ruling on Texas versus Johnson  took away protection from the flag. At  that time, many of us attempted to  ",1990
663,179,11,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Speak er,  I yield 3 minutes  to  the distin guished  gentleman  from California  [Mr. DANNEMEYER].  ",1990
664,179,11,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker,  when this Nation began its experiment  in self-government a  little over 200  years ago, there were no questions in  anyone's mind that the foundation of  our society was and is the Judeo-Chris tian ethic. This set of standards or  principles governed our  society and  the decisions  of  the U.S. Supreme  Court for roughly 150 years, and then  in this century a new prophet came  along by the name of John Dewey. He  set out to reform public education in  America by changing the very base on  which it is founded, and he has been  successful beyond his fondest dreams.  He, by the way, was an original signer  of the Humanist Manifesto in 1933. He  brought to this country the philoso phy of moral relativism of secular hu manism.  Mr. Speaker, these two philosophies  are in conflict today in this country.  Our distinguished colleague, the gen tleman from Illinois [Mr. HYDE], has  described this as a cultural war, and  that it is. There is a cultural war going  on in America today between the phi losophy of the Judeo-Christian ethic  and the philosophy of moral relativ ism.  The reason that the proponents of  the philosophy of moral  relativism  have difficulty in bringing themselves  to recognize the existence of a stand ard  in  this case, a standard dealing  with the flag of  the country,  is be cause people who believe that way do   not accept the existence of standards.  The philosophy of moral relativism  says that there is no God in heaven;  God did not create  this world. Any  man at any time can decide for him self or herself what they are going to  do, and they will tolerate no restric tions on their conduct at all.  0 1410  That philosophy is what drove the  decision, in my opinion, of the U.S. Su preme Court by telling us that we do  not have standards in protecting our  flag. That philosophy drove the deci sion in 1962, which said we are going  to take opening day prayer out of the  schools of America. That philosophy  drove the decision in Roe versus Wade  in 1973 that said we are not going to  recognize the right to human life in  America.  Then one of the most ridiculous de cisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in  1981 when we said we will no longer be  able to post the Ten Commandments  on the walls of the public classrooms  of America. That is the philosophy of  moral relativism that is driving  this  debate, and I say there are standards  that exist in our society.  Television commentator Ted Koppel  said  it very well  in addressing  the  graduating class of Duke University:  When Moses  came  down  from Mount  Sinai, he did not bring the Ten Suggestions.  He brought  the Ten Commandments and  the people  that run  the political system  today of this Nation are unwilling to accept  that fact.  I  say  affirm  the  Judeo-Christian  ethic. Affirm the existence of stand ards and vote for this constitutional  amendment.  No person should underestimate the signifi cance of a congressional vote on a constitu tional amendment  to prohibit desecration of  our Nation's premiere symbol of liberty without  license, the United States flag.  Our Supreme Court has ruled a second time  that the Constitution does not permit the Gov ernment to prosecute someone who burns the  flag. Many Americans  feel differently. These  Americans take pride in the heritage and his tory  represented by  the Stars and Stripes.  Many reflect back on  loved ones who gave  their lives for their country. Others new to this  country are grateful for a nation which exists  to provide them refuge  from oppression and  gives them a haven of opportunity.  I,  for one, am deeply disturbed over  the  entire controversy. The fact that the Supreme  Court has even had to consider such a case  is revealing about the cultural morass we find  ourselves in these days.  What a miserable state of existence we find  ourselves in when Congress is perfectly willing  to use Federal tax dollars to fund pornography  and obscenity spewed  forth by  the National  Endowment for the Arts, but we cannot seem  to muster the same enthusiasum  to allow a  community  the  right of self-determination  to  let a child utter a sincere prayer  in public  school to his or her Creator. We seem to care  little about the garbage which bombards our  youth daily. Yet, suggest that some miscreant  not be allowed to burn or desecrate the Amer ican flag and we have a national emergency.  We have had multiple generations raised to  believe that all standards are relative and that  all  liberties are civil and, hence, malleable.  The flag vote is a vote about a standard and  reasonable  limitations  in a  free society. Hu manists, or as Judge Robert Bork calls them  ""moral relativists,"" reject even modest limita tions on  personal conduct so  long as no  person is physically hurt.  We Americans will begin to make progress  on  the war against drugs,  teenage pregnan cies, and crime when we admit to ourselves  that the seriousness of these issues in Amer ica is more of a spiritual problem than one in volving a lack of necessary laws or enforce ment of laws.  Specifically, should we be surprised that the  last generation born in America is having diffi culty in saying no to drugs, which is the ob servance of a standard  in how we  treat our  own body, when as a society we booted the  Creator of standards in human conduct out of  the public education system?  Restoring voluntary prayer  in school  is an  essential step in educating our children on the  existence of standards and values as  the  foundation cornerstone for life.  It is no small thing that a majority of Demo crats  in  the  Judiciary Committee  voted  to  report the flag amendment unfavorably to the  House. They are simply reflecting  the moral  relativism which  infects the leadership of the  Democrat body politic. The Committee voted  18  to 18  to  report  the bill unfavorably-18  Democrats  versus  14 Republicans  and  4  Democrats. They voted 1 7 to 19 to report the  bill  favorably-this  time  three  Democrats  joined the Republicans. And finally, the com mittee voted 19 to 17 to report the bill without  recommendation-five  renegade Democrats  joining the Republicans.  We are a great Nation only when we prop erly weigh our rights against our responsibil ities. Maintaining  the sanctity of our national  symbol is a responsibility we cannot afford to  abdicate. All that is lost in doing so is the  li cense for some ingrate to throw a public tan trum. I believe society can afford such a loss.  ",1990

Mr. Speaker, for over 200 years, the Ameri can people have considered a total unaccept able act to burn the flag of our country.  For 200 years, we have considered it a vir tual act of treason  to burn or desecrate the  flag.  But now, we live in a liberal, permissive so ciety that appears willing to allow flag burning.  Virtually every Member of this Congress has  voted to protect the flag. The vast majority of  the American people want to protect the flag.  If the Supreme Court won't do it,  the Con gress and  the States should.  It will do no  harm to the Bill of Rights. Vote for the amend ment.  There are some actions that are unaccept able in our society. Maliciously throwing blood  on this building that symbolizes the bastion of  democracy is an unacceptable act.  ",1990

670,192,11,Mr.  SCHUETTE.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding this  time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of an  amendment  to  the Constitution  to  prohibit the burning of the American  flag.  The  decision  today  before  this  House is about the stars and stripes,  about the burned and battered, about  the American flag, the national torch  or an emblem of freedom or a flame of  infamy? That is the decision we make  today in an historic way.  The  amendment  is  a  statement  about what is right in America, and  anything less than that says, ""Don't  worry, be happy. It's all right.""  This is a statute. Its day has come  and  gone.  Everyone  knew  that  it  would not fly. It is a charade, it is a  camouflage. So it has disappeared, it  has vamoosed.  There are two points that I would  share with my  colleagues. This  is  about action and conduct, not speech  and expression. We are outlawing and  prohibiting the burning of the Ameri can flag.  The def endent  in  the Texas case  said words to the effect: ""To America,  to the Red, White and Blue, we spit on  you."" We are not prohibiting that. But  we are going to act.  Second, is the Bill of Rights being  trampled  on? No. Before  last year  there were  laws on the books  in 48  States, including Michigan, that pro hibited the burning of the American  flag. Did that kill our right of expres sion? Did it freeze our speech? No. So  we are not impacting on the Bill of  Rights.  What has happened is that a year  ago 5 people in a nation of 200 million  made a decision, and they were wrong.  Was the Court right when they denied  basic  rights  to African-Americans  in  this country? No. Was the Court right  when they treated African-Americans  like property instead of people. No.  When they were wrong, we made a  change. Was  the Court  right when  they denied child labor laws to people  and a humane working environment?  No. We made a change.  The point here  is  that when  the  Court is wrong, as it is here, we must  change it. If we want to stop the burn ing of  the flag, we need an amend ment.  Mr. Speaker,  I  encourage my col leagues  to  vote  for  this  narrowly  drawn,  tightly  crafted  amendment  that restores our decency and what is  right about America.  Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in support of a  constitutional amendment to protect the U.S.  flag from acts of desecration.  I do not do so lightly, or without being abso lutely sure that this amendment is apporpriate  and necessary.  The Stars and Stripes, or  the burned and  battered? The American  flag, or the national  torch? An emblem of freedom, or a flame of  infamy?  That's the  fundamental question  for Amer ica. That's the  fundamental question  for  this  House as we  take part  in  this historic deci sion. The proposed amendment  is a state ment of pride in America, a staple of respect  for our country, our people, our values. Any thing less will send the message: Don't worry,  be happy, everything is OK.  The cover of  the sham,  the charade,  the  camouflage of a Federal statute, which every one knew wouldn't fly, is gone. We are left, as  some of us argued  last year, with voting  to  ensure protection of our flag with a constitu tional amendment, or  to  insist  that our  flag  can be destroyed without punishment.  Two points must be considered:  First, this issue is about action and conduct,  not speech and expression. It was the action  of Joey Johnson, who challenged  the Texas  law prohibiting flag burning,  that we will ban.  It's not his words or his speech that we want  to outlaw. Joey Johnson burned the American  flag, and that's wrong. He also said: ""America,  the red, white, and blue, we spit on you.""  I  find that wrong, repugnant, offensive. But we  are not outlawing his use of those words  in  the form of political protest, as vile as we find  them  to be. We are simply making sure  that  he can never again destroy the American flag  without facing appropriate punishment.  Second, we must consider the Bill of Rights.  Some say we are  trampling on  it with  this  amendment. That's not true. Remember that  only a year ago there were laws in 48 States,  including my home State of Michigan,  that  made it a crime to burn a flag. Did those laws  curtail  our  speech? Did  they  outlaw  Joey  Johnson's speech? No. Did  they destroy our  ability to express political dissent? No.  Have people's values changed since  last  year, values  that hold  it  is wrong  to destroy  the flag and right to punish those who do? No.  What's changed since last year is that our  ability to prohibit flag burning has been taken  away by a decision wrongly made by the Su preme Court. These Justices are people, and  people make mistakes. The Court has been  wrong before.  Was  the Court correct when  it denied  the  rights and guarantees secured by our Consti tution that African-Americans should be treat ed as people, not property? No, of course not.  But that's how our Justices ruled  in the Dred  Scott case. Was  the Court correct when  it  ruled against child labor protections meant to  guarantee a humane and just working environ ment that did not abuse our youth? No. The  Court was wrong  then,  just  like  the Court is  wrong today.  The  question  before  us  is whether we  should  live with  the Court's erroneous deci sion? Should we view the destruction of our  flag as a  right, a privilege, an action  that  simply cannot be stopped? Should we consid er the destruction of our flag, as some have  argued, to be unimportant, a trifle matter that  means little to our society?  No,  today Congress draws a  line. Today,  we'll make history. Today, we'll finally find  it  within ourselves to say enough is enough. We  can protect our  flag without destroying  the  values that is symbolizes; we can protect our  flag and enhance those values.  What  is right and what  is wrong? For too  long we as a nation have allowed  the  lines  that distinguish  right  from wrong  to become  blurred. We have allowed those who claim to  protect our liberty to grossly distort our soci ety's values. We have reached a point where  people worship liberty and totally disregard re sponsibility. We  live  in a time when  there  is  too  little  respect  for people, our  laws, and,  yes, for our flag.  In the decision today, if you want to prohibit  flag burning  in America,  to protect  the  flag  and douse the torch,  to salute the Stars and  Stripes, not  those who burn and batter,  to  honor an emblem of freedom, no a flame of  infamy, you vote for what is right. You vote for  responsible behavior. You vote  for  respect.  You vote for the amendment.  ",1990

Mr. Speaker, I love  our  flag and despise  those who at tempt to destroy it. Whether I see it  flying in front of a school or a farm, or  draped over the coffin of a military  hero,  I  am  always moved  by Old  Glory. I have supported tough crimi nal  laws  to put flag burners  in  jail.  Those who desecrate the flag are radi cals seeking attention from  law-abid ing citizens. Our disgust is all they de serve.  Last week five Supreme Court jus tices struck down a  law designed  to  protect our flag. Now the Bush admin istration and  some  in Congress are  trying to force the issue by amending  our Constitution. Supporters of such  an amendment are being portrayed as  true patriots. On the other side are  those who seek to preserve the integri ty of  the Bill of Rights  and who  oppose efforts to amend the Constitu tion. They  are  being portrayed  as  walking hand in hand with flag burn ers. Such characterizations are  ludi crous.  I will vote against a constitutional  amendment.  I have concluded, after  much deliberation, that the best way  to silence those who would burn the  flag is to ignore them. Throughout its  200-year history, the Constitution has  provided the real symbol for freedom seeking people around the globe. The  Bill of Rights has withstood many  challenges,  including  those  which  would restrict our right to bear arms  and those which would muffle Ameri ca's free press.  Last year, when the Supreme Court  ruled that the Texas statute prohibit ing flag burning was unconstitutional,  I reacted angrily like most Americans.  I disagreed with the court's decision  and promptly endorsed the first con stitutional amendment that was pro posed to me. However, after much re flection I am most stirred by the fact  that the Bill of Rights  is unique  to  America. It is the beacon which tena cious people around  the world hold  before  them,  illuminating  their cau tious  steps  toward more  free  and  democratic societies.  I retain my commitment to protect ing the flag. The Flag Protection Act  of 1990 was introduced Wednesday in  the House. I am an original sponsor of  this legislation. I will vote for it today.  We can protect the flag if we write a  bill that satisfies the Supreme Court. I  believe this bill, if challenged, will be  found to be constitutional by the Su preme Court.  Mr. Speaker, our Republic  is not  threatened  by  flag  burners.  Our  Nation has survived a devastating civil  war, world wars, a great depression,  and  riots without compromising  the  Bill of Rights. We will  survive  the  senseless acts of a few flag burners.  America's future is in doubt, instead,  because of our huge Federal budget  deficit, a decaying infrastructure, a re gressive tax policy,  increasing  illiter acy and declining economic competi tiveness. I urge President Bush to turn  his leadership responsibilities to these  areas which pose genuine  threats to  our Nation.  ",1990
676,218,11,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Speak er, I yield such time as he may con sume to the gentleman from Califor nia [Mr. SHUMWAY].  ",1990
677,218,11,Mr. SHUMWAY.," Mr. Speaker, as a  gross political opportunist,  I  rise  in  strong support of the amendment.  Mr. Speaker,  last year, we enacted a so called content neutral statute to prohibit dese cration of the flag. Since  it was the only op portunity we were offered to express our com mitment to protecting the flag, I supported the  measure,  saying,  ""only  time will  tell  if  this  measure is sufficient.""  Well,  time has  told: The statute did not  stand  the constitutional  test. We now have  three choices. We can pass another simple  statute, knowing  full well  that  it,  too, will be  struck down. We can approve a constitutional  amendment, knowing  full well  that  it  is  the  only effective way  to ban desecration of the  Stars and Stripes. Or we  can do nothing,  knowing full well that such inaction will result  in  further abhorrent destruction of our  fore most symbol. To me, the choice is simple.  I can't speak for all of my colleagues, but  my own constituents have made their collec tive viewpoint clear: protect  the  flag, period.  Since recent history has made it clear that the  mandate can only be met by amending  the  I  support  such  an  strongly  Constitution,  amendment.  Opponents of the amendment process have  painted  a  somewhat  repugnant  picture  of  amendment supporters. We are portrayed as  politically motivated, righteously wrapping our selves in Old Glory to disguise some devious  ulterior motive. That is a specious and offen sive agrument. As I stated earlier, my constitu ents have said ""protect the flag.""  I tried set tling  for  the  statute approach;  the  statute  failed. It is simply a matter of producing an ef fective solution.  Those same opponents also contend  that  amending the Constitution in this manner will  erode the First Amendment, and will open the  door  to all kinds of potential abuses.  I dis agree. There  is no erosion of First Amend ment  rights here. We are simply protecting  one  item,  the  flag,  from one act, physical  desecration.  If amending  the Constitution  in good  faith  were such a dire step, our founding  fathers  would not have provided us with the means to  do so. They were astute enough to make the  Constitution a dynamic document, capable of  adapting to changing times and the accompa nying changing needs. To be  fair,  I sincerely  doubt  that  they ever  imagined an American  citizen would see fit to be disrespectful to the  flag to which he, or she, had sworn allegiance.  And,  frankly,  I sincerely doubt  they would  have viewed  such an act as  ""freedom of  speech.""  Adoption of  this amendment very clearly  puts  the  enforcement mechanism  into  the  hands of the people. First, they can encour age their State legislators to ratify the meas ure. Secondly, they can call upon those same  legislators  to  take appropriate action  to pro tect the flag.  Freedom of expression is a responsibility as  well as a liberty.  It does not include the right  to cause panic by falsely yelling fire in a public  place, nor does it sanction slander or obsceni ty.  In my view, desecration of the American  flag,  for which so many courageous Ameri cans have made sacrifices, is not freedom of  expression.  It  is a  travesty, and  it must be  stopped.  ",1990

That  is  the difference  here.  To me, there is a difference between  saying something abusive about  the  flag, although I would object to that  too, and an act of physical violence.  Burning the flag is not just talk, but a  physical assault. I make the same dis tinction as cussing a person, which is  not punishable, and hitting him in the  face while doing it, which  is punish able.

681,231,11,Mrs. UNSOELD.," Mr. Speaker, In the  Constitution of  the Uniuted States,  the Founding Fathers of our great  Nation laid out for the world to see a  new  philosophy of  self-government.  Today  the yearning  for democratic  rule sweeps like wildfire through East ern Europe, and we prepare next year  to celebrate the 200th anniversary of  the  ratification of our own Bill of  Rights.  How ironic it would be  if we were  today to render criminal that very act  by which free people everywhere have  shown their extreme displeasure with  their government-the symbolic burn ing of their own national flag.  The  true measure of our commit ment to freedom is our level of toler ance for  that which we  find  repug nant. Freedom of speech is fundamen tally a protection of the rights of the  minority against the will of the major ity. We must not allow the majority to  dictate the boundaries of permissible  speech  to the minority, for  through  that door lurks totalitarianism and re pression. How unfortunate it will be if  we embark upon that path even as we  prepare  to celebrate our own 200th  birthday of our Bill or Rights.  Even more unfortunate will be the  fact  that  this  journey may be  the  result  of  political  consultants who  want  to use  the  flag as a partisan  weapon in the upcoming election.  We need to be big enough, and confi dent enough of ourselves, not to place  the symbol, however much we love it,  above  that which  it symbolizes-our  first amendment and our right to ex press ourselves freely.  I vote for my flag. I vote for the Bill  of Rights. I vote for the vision of liber ty so boldly proclaimed two centuries  ago by our Founding Fathers. I vote  ""no"" on this amendment.  We in this Congress are expendable  but the freedoms over which our flag  so proudly flies are not.  ",1990

683,231,11,Mr. ROSE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in op position to the amendment.  Mr. Speaker, last year marked the bicenten nial anniversary of the greatest event in our  Nation's history:  the estabishment of a  true  democracy  under  the Constitution  of  the  United States of America. As a native of Fay etteville, NC, I look with genuine pride on the  part may State and my home city played  in  this important year. I would like to briefly take  my colleagues back a few years and share a  little of this proud history.  Mr. Speaker, Thomas Jefferson's declara tion of independence was anticipated in North  Carolina  by  nearly  14 months, when  the  Mecklenberg Resolves  and Declaration  of  1775 called for independence from Great Brit ain. The seeds of revolution took root early in  North Carolina, and  that desire  for  freedom  prospered during  the  fight  for independence  and the subsequent birth of our Government.  With good  reason North Carolinians proudly  proclaim our State ""first in freedom.""  The assembly for the First Congress in New  York in March of 1789, and George Washing ton's inaugural in April did not mark the end of  the struggle for independence and a constitu tion;  two States remained outside the Union.  Neither Rhode Island nor North Carolina had  ratified the Constitution.  The previous year, on July 21, 1788, our  ratification convention had assembled at St.  Matthew's Church in Hillsborough, NC. Feder alists  at  the Hillsborough  assembly  urged  speedy ratification, but the Tarheels were not  to be rushed. The convention proceeded with  an article-by-article examination and debate of  the proposed Constitution. Opponents of the  document, argued chiefly that the power and  sovereignty of the States would be imperiled,  and that a Bill of Rights was absolutely neces sary to prevent Federal  infringement on  indi vidual freedoms. It was evident that the major ity at Hillsborough was willing to ask the tough  questions about the future of their new found  freedom. After 1 O days of spirited debate,  North Carolina decided to neither adopt, nor  reject, the Constitution.  Meanwhile, events were moving forward  in  the First Congress. This remarkable body ac complished  perhaps more work  of  lasting  value in less time than almost any of the 100  Congresses which  have  followed. Perhaps  most important of the many achievements of  the First Congress was passage of the Bill of  Rights, which provided the needed impetus for  a  second North Carolina Convention-per haps now it was time for the Tarheel State to  enter the Union. The Assembly convened on  November 2, 1789, and authorized a second  convention, to meet at Fayetteville, NC,  in 2  weeks time.

688,257,11,Mr. MILLER of Washington.," Madam Speak er,  hours  have  been  spent  debating  the  causes of homelessness. There is no simple,  clear-cut answer. But one  thing  is certain,  helping  to educate homeless children  is a  sure step toward a long-term solution. It's time  to focus our energies and resources on what  could  become  the  next generation of  the  homeless.  Homeless children often are  the  forgotten  poor. Families with children are now the fast est growing segment of America's homeless.  Nearly one-half of these children  receive no  formal education.  The long-term implications of this are tragic.  All children have  the  right  to an education.  The link between poverty and the lack of edu cation is well documented. These children de serve a chance. And this bill gives them that  chance.  Madam Speaker, nearly  two-thirds of our  homeless children come from households with  incidents of child abuse, sexual assault, and  domestic violence. These  children  need  a  stable educational program addressing emo tional, developmental, and stress-related prob lems. The longer a child is out of school, the  less likely it is that he or she will ever return.  Many homeless children never re-enroll  in  school. Those who do  return  to school are  generally far behind their peers academically.  Thus, their chance for educational failure is in creased.  This  legislation  amends  the  McKinney  Homeless Assistance Act to help keep home less children in school. In its present form the  McKinney Act will  not  finance school pro grams, but  leaves  that  responsibility  to  the  States. My proposal allows funds to go direct ly to local school districts. These direct funds  can be used for services like the evaluation of  special needs; record transfer; counseling and  psychological services; parent education and  training;  transportation costs; special  training  for teachers and counselors; and before-and after school programs and  job opportunities  for homeless youth. My bill also allows pre schools and nonprofit schools to compete for  funds.  I urge your support of  this measure. The  number of homeless children nationwide is in creasing dramatically. Join me  in  taking  this  positive step  toward breaking  the cycle of  poverty.  FLAG AMENDMENT  ",1990
689,257,11,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gentleman from California, [Mr. DORGAN]  is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1990
690,257,11,Mr. DORNAN of California.," Madam  Speaker,  I  said  earlier  during  the  debate, because I was only afforded 2  minutes,  and  the  constitutional  amendment  to  protect Old Glory  means a  lot to me. I am 57 years of  age, and as a reporter, a correspond ent, I went to Vietnam 10 times, and I  witnessed the full measure of devotion  that some men gave,  their lives, and  some Army nurses fighting for what  that flag stands for, and I would like  to have had 5 minutes, 10 minutes  during the debate today.  I am not feeling bad about it at all,  because HENRY HYDE spoke every word  from his intellect and his heart that I  wished I could have spoken today. My  wife called me  right afterward and  said our friend, HENRY,  truly walked  into the pages of this Nation's history  today, and that he did.  I would just like to briefly talk about  just one thing that I wanted to men tion on the floor today, and I gave re spect to all those who put all their ef forts  into  trying  to make  the  first  amendment  inviolable,  and who  I  think disregarded the fifth article of  the  original Constitution  of which  James Madison was the father, which  provides  for amending  the Constitu tion by telling a story that happened  on one of my visits to Vietnam.  But before I do that, I want to ex plain why I am not taking the 60 min utes. Last night I was supposed to be  part of an all night session, a series of  1-hour  special  orders  like  this  minu te one I am doing now, to discuss  crime in this country. I had prepared  my hour special order, and I  joined  the effort  late, so  I had  the  tough  watch 3 to 4 a.m.  I was seeing off my son, my daugh ter-in-law, little baby Haley, who is 2  years of age, and my daughter-in-law  is about to deliver in about 2 months  my eighth grandchild, and on the way  back from  the airport my wife said  why did I not stop off at home, have  some dinner, and get a nap. When I  went to sleep, she deliberately turned  off  the alarm, making me  feel  like  Peter,  one  of  the  apostles  at  the  Garden of Gethsemane, because when  I woke up early in the morning I saw  that my colleagues were here, and I  had not answered my watch.  But the unsung heroes of that all  night session on crime worked behind  me here, this excellent staff, the re porters who worked all night long and  all day, and anybody expecting my 60minute special order  tonight,  I had  said I was going to do that not think ing that I had slept on my watch late  last night, and these good folks were  there all night long. So out of respect  for them I will do the 60 minutes on  the flag next week, and just tell this  one story.  5First of all, something shocked me  today. I am not squealing on my fellow  colleagues, but I think Americans out  there should know  this, particularly  young people.  I asked 100 Members,  left, right, Republican, Democrat, lib eral,  conservative, male,  female,  if  they knew what flag or pennant flies  above the United States flag. Not one  single  Congressman  on  this  floor  knew, not one could give me a correct  answer. They could not come up with  an answer at all.  The closest anybody came was Rev.  BILL GRAY, of Pennsylvania. He looked  at me  quizzically  and he  said,  ""A  Christian flag?"" What Christian flag?  But he was close. I told him, ""You are  close, the only one that has had any  inkling at all.""  I  informed all of the pages on my  side of the aisle, and now while they  are attending their high school years  they will know something  that 100  Congressmen do not know on  this  floor, and I  think that I am safe to  assume that what one Democrat told  me is true, that not a Member of this  body knows that the one pennant over  the flag that flies above Old Glory is a  religious flag, but not Christian. It can  be Jewish also. It is a white pennant,  an isosceles triangle, a  long pennant,  and it has on it the cross of Jesus  Christ, the Jewish star of David, and it  flies on ship mastheads and on bases,  Army posts, Air Force posts all around  this world, Marine Corps posts, and it  says, ""The chaplain  is on ship,  reli gious services are taking place on the  base or on the post,  the chaplain is  here,  the  rabbi,  the  chaplain,  the  priest, or the minister.""  Now the reason I know this well is  because I have debated the Nation's  loudest  atheist,  Madalyn Murray  O'Hair, who wants us to either elimi nate  that pennant completely or  to  put it beneath the flag. But it teaches  us a lesson that we do have our prior ities  straight  in  the United States:  God, family, and country.  0 2040  And we are not going to protect by  constitutional amendment ever, what  some Members tried to terrify us with  today,  religious symbols, because we  represent all  sorts of  religions and  they are all protected. What protects  them? This secular symbol behind me,  Old Glory.  Because  in  that  first  amendment that we heard about over  and over again, and  I  have had  it  memorized since I was a school child and it was not the first amendment, it  was originally  the third amendment.  The first two were about pay, and one  of them I wish would have been left  on there. It says no sitting Congress  can vote  itself a pay raise  to begin  until after there has been an interven ing election so  that the people can  judge whether or not the Members in  39-059 0-91-9 (Pt. 11)  ",1990
691,270,11,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to introduce the Model Good Samaritan  Food Donation Act.  Its purpose is to provide  States with a comprehensive model  for  re moving one of  the major disincentives  to  those who would donate food and other gro cery products to charities assisting the needy.  Through the efforts of the Second Harvest  National Food Bank Network and similar char ities engaged in feeding the needy, Good Sa maritan  laws have been enacted  in all 50  States which provide limitations on  liability to  those who donate  food. A 1989 study  indi cates that these statutes vary significantly in  the degree of coverage  they provide,  the  types of donors who receive  this protection,  and the types of product donations which are  covered by these laws.  Since many of the companies that are po tential  food and grocery item donors are na tional in scope, standardized liability protection  would result in greater confidence on the part  of  the  industry and more donations being  made available at both the national and local  levels. In order to provide guidance to States  that wish to provide comprehensive, standard ized coverage to those who support the non profit sector's admirable efforts to assist those  in need,  I am proposing enactment of  the  Model Good Samaritan Food Donation Act.  This bill will require no government expendi tures, I believe that it will be an important re source to those charities that are trying to so licit donations of food and other necessities to  support their efforts.  If enacted on  the State  level, especially  in  the many States whose  current good faith donor statutes do not con tain some of the important provisions included  in  this act,  the Model Good Samaritan Food  Donation Act will remove a significant barrier  to private sector support of the nonprofit sec tor's efforts.  The Model Good Samaritan Food Donation  Act has  the support of a wide spectrum of  nonprofit groups,  including  the Second Har vest Network, which  consists of 200  food  banks serving over 39,000 charities, and  the  food and restaurant industries.  Many in the charitable sector rely heavily on  private product donations  to serve  those  in  need. In thousands of communities throughout  the country, the private and nonprofit sectors  have worked together to ease the plight of the  homeless,  the hungry, and others  in need.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  This act will, at no cost to the Federal, State,  or  local governments, assist  their admirable  efforts. I ask you to join me in supporting their  efforts by supporting this act.  THE COMPREHENSIVE LONG TERM CARE INCENTIVE ACT  HON. JOHN J. RHODES III  OF ARIZONA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 21, 1990  ",1990
692,270,11,Mr. RHODES.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  in troducing the Comprehensive Long-Term Care  Incentive Act of 1990, which promotes a pri vate-public partnership  to stimulate the  long term care insurance market.  The national debate over long-term care is  moving toward center stage, propelled by the  escalating costs faced by growing numbers of  older Americans. They and their baby boomer  children fear becoming destitute and demoral ized by a disabling illness.  My  legislation responds to the near-univer sal desire of the frail and chronically ill people  to remain in familiar surroundings, with control  over  their  lives, whenever possible. This bill  shifts  the  institutional bias of Medicare and  Medicaid, as well as private  long-term care  policies, by providing coverage and incentives  for utilizing home and community-based care.  Planning ahead  for  the possible expenses  of chronic care must become a customary rite  of aging. Long-term care policy requires incen tives and options to succeed, unlike the short sighted Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act  of 1988. Congress needs to take action, but  more thoughtful action this time around.  I urge my colleagues to join me in support  of this important legislation.  COMPREHENSIVE LONG-TERM CARE INCENTIVE  ACT OF 1990  TITLE 1: TAX TREATMENT OF LONG-TERM CARE  (LTC) INSURANCE PLANS  Treatment of LTC Insurance  A. Amends  the  Internal Revenue Code  <IRC)  to treat qualified LTC insurance as  accident and health insurance for purposes  of tax deductions on individual income tax  returns.  B. Allows employers under  the  IRC  to  offer employees qualified LTC insurance as  a tax-free fringe benefit. The employer con tribution would be deductible.  C. Excludes from gross  income amounts  withdrawn from Individual Retirement Ac counts <IRAs) or 40l<k) Plans for purposes  of purchasing qualified LTC insurance.  D. Allows the non-taxable exchange of life  insurance policies for qualified LTC insur ance.  Employer Funding of Medical Benefits  A.  Encourages  companies  to  establish  health benefit accounts  for  retirees  and  their spouses and dependents. Provides a  tax deduction for the employer's contribu tion to the accounts.  B. Defines funded reserve accounts and  vesting requirements to qualify for tax de duction of premiums paid, including special  rules <excise  tax) on allocated assets not  used to provide retiree health benefits.  Reverse Mortgage Insurance for Older  Americans  A. Amends the National Housing Act to  allow reverse mortgages and sale-leaseback  June 21, 1990  arrangements, whereby homeowners could  convert their equity interest for purposes of  purchasing qualified LTC insurance.  Income Tax Credits  A. Provides a $2,000 refundable credit for  custodial care of certain dependents in the  taxpayer's home.  B. Allows a taxpayer to receive a refund able credit for expenses for LTC services  provided to certain independent persons re quiring such care. This is a credit against  tax imposed in the amount equal to 25 per cent of the qualified LTC expenses, not ex ceeding $2,000, but only permitted for those  below 150 percent of the poverty level.  TITLE II: LONG-TERM CARE BENEFIT AND RELATED  SERVICES  Part One: Expansion of Medicare Benefits  Subtitle A: Medicare Provisions  A. Medicare Coverage of Screening of  Mammography.  B.  In-home Respite Care  for Certain  Chronically  Dependent  Individuals-pro vides up to 80 hours per year of services to  relieve  those caring for homebound Medi care beneficiaries.  C. Extends Home Health Services-clari fies  that ""intermittent"" home health care  covered by Medicare may mean care provid ed 7 days per week for up to 33 consecutive  days.  D. Expands the Hospice Benefit-permits  unlimited hospice care for terminally ill pa tients if a physician recertifies that the pa tient remains terminally ill after the exist ing 210-day limit is exhausted.  E. Reimburses Home  Intravenous Drug  Therapy Services with prior physician ap proval and under a designated fee schedule.  F. Coverage of Colon-Rectal Screening Ex aminations.  Part Two: Medigap Insurance  A. Medigap Fraud  and Abuse  Protec tions-increases civil penalties from $5,000  to $25,000 for issuing duplicative policies.  B. Establishment of a Medigap  toll-free  consumer ""Hotline"" through a state grant  program.  Subtitle B: Medicaid LTC Insurance  Demonstration Projects  A. The Secretary of Health and Human  Services shall provide for a demonstration  project and  the necessary  accompanying  waivers for any requesting State to allow in dividuals with income and resources above  the Medicaid eligibility level to receive LTC  benefits under State's plan, by purchasing  an approved LTC insurance policy.  B. The State shall provide assurances that  its demonstration project for LTC services  will not exceed the estimated average per  capita and aggregate expenditures  in ab sence of  the waiver  from  the federal  re quirements.  C. The State will continue to provide LTC  services for those entitled to Medicaid bene fits prior to the State obtaining the waiver,  and  implementing  the  demonstration  project.  D. The State's plan must meet standards  at least as stringent as those set forth in the  January 1990 Long-Term Care  Insurance  Model Regulation of the National Associa tion of  Insurance Commissioners <NAIC)  and for the duration of 5 years.  TITLE III: FEDERAL NATIONAL LONG-TERM CARE  REINSURANCE CORPORATION  A.

693,283,11,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, the democra tization process that has taken place in East ern and Central Europe suffered a major set back last week in Romania.  In .the weeks fol lowing  the election of  Ion  lliescu, a  former  high-ranking Communist official,  to be Presi dent  of Romania,  this  country  has  been  rocked by violence and repression. There are  increasing signs of the new regime relying on  terror and repression to quash dissent.  Last week,  the Romanian President-elect  called out the police and miners from western  Romania to break up a peaceful group of anti Government protesters. The miners  subse quently brutally attacked anyone suspected of  being a Government critic, and ransacked the  offices of opposition parties and independent  newspapers.  In  the aftermath, a number of  student  protestors  and  opposition  leaders  have been arrested on charges of instigating  violence.  Mr. Speaker,  the Romanian people have  demonstrated that their desire to live under a  democratic system. Last December hundreds,  perhaps thousands, of Romanians died in an  effort to secure that right. But the new lliescu  government, while employing  the  rhetoric of  democracy, has sought to consolidate power  through violent, nondemocratic means.  The  Bush  administration,  to  its  credit,  wasted no  time  in condemning  this outrage.  As soon as lliescu began his campaign of re pression, the United States joined with many  Western European nations in suspending non humanitarian  economic  support  assistance.  Such an action lets the Romanian  leadership  know there  is a price to pay for a return  to  authoritarianism.  In addition, U.S. Ambassador Alan J. Green  boycotted  this week's Presidential  inaugura tion ceremony as a demonstration of U.S.  strong displeasure. This Member regrets  the  fact  that other western democracies didn't  also  boycott  the  inauguration. We  should  stand together in condemning  this continuing  tyranny in Romania.  Mr. Speaker, as  the vice chairman of  the  Human Rights Subcommittee of  the House  Foreign Affairs Committee, this Member com mends President Bush and Secretary Baker  for  their  strong  and  forceful  response  to  events in Romania. A message needed to be  sent that the United States and the American  people abhor this repression, intimidation, and  violence in Romania and we will as a govern ment and people use what leverage we pos sess to see that it ends. The administration's  action and statement sent  that message  to  the Romanian Government; our allies should  join us.  THE FOLLY OF MOUSE  HYSTERIA  HON. PHILIP M. CRANE  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 21, 1990  ",1990
694,283,11,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, since the 1950's  the United States has been engaged in a reg ulatory war to rid our society of all carcino gens. To most Americans the word ""carcino gen""  invokes  images of harmful manmade  chemicals, even though natural substances in cluding  table pepper, mushrooms, and pea nuts contain chemicals that cause cancer  in  mice. In her article ""The Folly of Mouse Hys teria,"" Mr. Elizabeth M. Whelan urges that we  must use common sense  in evaluating bio medical research. She further points out that  money spent on research to identify carcino gens might be more productively spent on  programs such as ones which help people  stop smoking. I urge my colleagues to consid er this article which offers practical advice on  cancer prevention.  THE FOLLY OF MOUSE HYSTERIA  <By Elizabeth M. Whelan, ScD, MPH>  The spring of 1989 will  long be remem bered for Alarmania: the fear that gripped  the nation after ""60 Minutes"" released an  environmental group's report claiming that  children  risked developing cancer because  the U.S apple crop was sprayed with a car cinogen.  Apple  products  were  destroyed,  and  schools temporarily banned the fruit in all  its various configurations. A wire  service  carried a story about a mother in upstate  New York who, having heard on the news  that apples cause cancer, called the state  police and had their child's school bus inter cepted so that an apple could be removed  from the child's lunch box. Johnny Carson  complained  that  the  Surgeon  General  wanted people to have safe sex but that he  couldn't even find a safe snack.  Most people were unaware of a  similar  scare that swept the nation 30 years before.  In the fall of 1959, Arthur S. Flemming, sec retary of health, educational and welfare,  announced that the U.S. cranberry crop was  contaminated with a carcinogen. As a result,  millions of Thanksgiving dinners were eaten  that year sans the traditional sauce.  These two incidents-and others involving  cyclamates, nitrites,  saccharin, hair dyes  and pesticides-have two things in common:  rodents, and the regulatory straightjacket  which declares that any chemical causing  cancer  in a  laboratory  in any dose  is a  cancer risk to humans and must be purged at any cost.  The mouse-to-man extrapolation is an es sential weapon in the arsenal of those who  seek to terrify us about food additives, pesti cides and other common trace-level chem cials. The word ""carcinogen"" has been used  so liberally that many Americans probably  believe that we are surrounded by cancer causing agents produced by American indus try and that we must regulate these ""bad  apples"" out of existence.  The  time has come for us  to recognize  that  ""mouse  terrorism""  poses  a  serious  problem in terms of maintaining both our  high standard of  living and our enviable  state of good health.  The scientific justification for the mouse man extrapolation was weak when it first  15357  surfaced in 1958, the year Congress passed  the  so-called Delaney Clause, which  re quired that a food additive be banned if it  caused cancer when ingested by any animal  in any dose. The Delaney concept later me tastasized  to  the  regulation of non-food  items, launching a carcinogen witch hunt.  In the 1950s, it was assumed that the few  carcinogens  in the universe needed  to be  eliminated, that all carcinogens were man made and that removing carcinogens would  diminish the cancer toll in this country.  These theories have since been shown to  be without merit. Carcinogens abound: Two thirds of all industrial chemicals that have  been tested caused cancer in some circum stances in laboratory animals; natural sub stances including table pepper, mushrooms  and peanuts contain chemicals that cause  cancer in mice; and research has revealed  that smoking and overexposure to sunlight  are among  the real causes of cancer. No  textbook gives any serious attention to trace  levels of chemicals as a cause of human  cancer.  If we  proceed with  regulatory  efforts  based on the assumption that a mouse is a  miniature man, we are going to have very  little left to eat. For example, we risk ban ning most pesticides, which would have a  devastating effect on the quantity, quality  and price of produce.  Animals are essential  in biomedical  re search, but so is common sense. Ironically,  we  exhibit  sound  judgment  concerning  human carcinogens. We don't demand zero  exposure to sunlight and radiation just be cause they can cause skin cancer and leuke mia, respectively.  Instead, we use prudence.  Interestingly,  we do the same in regulating natural chemi cals that cause cancer in some animals. For  example, the Food and Drug Administration  has set tolerances for aflatoxins-naturally  produced substances  formed by mold on  peanuts, corn and other products.  The Alar fiasco cost  the United States  hundreds of millions of dollars in toxicologi cal studies, crop losses and direct taxpayer  subsidies  to  farmers. This  ""investment""  probably won't  thwart  a  single  case  of  cancer. On  the  other  hand,  the  same  amount of money spent to help people stop  smoking cigarettes would contribute enor mously to cancer prevention.  How should we respond to the emotional  plea of a mother who argues, ""If there is  even a possibility that the mouse data are  relevant  to my child,  I  think we should  eliminate . . . ""? You fill in the carcinogen of  the month. Here is my rejoinder:  We  have  excelled  as  an  industrialized  country because we favor science over su perstition.  There is no evidence that trace levels of  chemicals  cause  cancer  in humans-even  though huge doses might increase the risk  of cancer in mice.  Cancer rates-with the exception of those  for lung cancer and melanoma, which are  caused by smoking and overexposure to sun light,  respectively-have  stabilized or declined since we dramatically increased the  use of agricultural chemicals after World  War II.  Chemicals  that cause cancer  in animals  abound  in nature. If we were  to ban all  mouse carcinogens based on the just-in-case  theory, we would suffer shortages in all con sumer  products without  improving  the  health of children or adults.  Federal standards set overly cautious tol erances for residues of pesticides in foods.  Ironically, recent government surveys found  .  ",1990
695,296,11,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, we have heard  a great deal about reforms of the South Afri can system of apartheid  that have been un dertaken by  that country's President, F.W.  DeKlerk. President DeKlerk's actions to date  are certainly worthy of praise, however, there  is a long road ahead before the conditions set  forth by  the Congress  in  the Anti-Apartheid  Act will have been met.  Indeed, the status of  the situation is best described with the words  used by my friend Lindiwe Mabuza, the chief  U.S.  representative of  the African National  Congress, to headline the editorial which ap pears below-""Apartheid: Far From Over.""  Please give your careful consideration to the  update on  the progress of peaceful change  which she has written. I find her observations  factually correct and her views to be eminent ly reasonable.  APARTHEID: FAR FROM OVER  <By Lindiwe Mabuza)  WASHINGTON.-Nelson Mandela is visiting  the U.S. to pay tribute to the long and ardu ous struggle of so many Americans who sup ported him and to urge all Americans com mitted to democracy,  justice, freedom and  equality to continue sanctions against Pre toria.  News of the Free South Africa Movement  reached Mr. Mandela even inside his prison  walls, and helped sustain him and his fellow  prisoners. He heard about students building  shantytowns on their campuses in support  of divestment, about longshoremen who re fused to unload goods created by apartheid,  about city councils that voted to withdraw  pension funds from companies doing busi ness  in South Africa. He heard that the  anti-apartheid  struggle  involved  even  schoolchildren.  This was  a  phenomenal  constituency,  built at a time when U.S. policy was more  aligned to apartheid than to the aspirations  for  democracy  of millions  of  oppressed  people. Thus, we are all the more grateful  for the sacrifices and commitment of the  many Americans who persevered. And we  certainly made some gains. Mr. Mandela is  out of prison because you wanted him re leased. But our people are not free to vote,  June 21, 1990  to elect our representatives, to decide the  destiny of our country.  Mr. Mandela is free, but there are still  more than 3,000 political prisoners in South  African jails. He is alive, but the South Afri can police are still maiming and killing his  fellow citizens for their political convictions.  The state of emergency has been partly  lifted. But the Government still has many  of the same powers it haa under the emer gency decree. The Government can outlaw  any organization, ban any publication or  place any person under house arrest.  Yesterday, Parliament voted to repeal the  Separate Amenities Act, which segregated  public facilities. Yet, under the Internal Se curity Act, the police can still detain a polit ical activist and hold that person incommu nicado for a substantial period of time.  African National Congress members are  still being arrested. Political trials are still  occurring at the same pace as  last year.  Government  soldiers  continue  to occupy  black townships. Anti-apartheid demonstra tions can still be disrupted at the whim of  the police.  And the state of emergency has not been  lifted in Natal Province, where its continu ation exacerbates violence.  In other words, the anti-apartheid strug gle is still far from over. We have taken only  the first steps on a long and difficult road.  We welcome and applaud  the efforts of  President F.W. DeKlerk, but our goal of a  unified,  democratic  and nonracial South  Africa is still a faraway vision.  We are gratified that President Bush is  said  to  favor continued sanctions against  Pretoria. Nevertheless, we are amazed and  shocked that certain governments are call ing impatiently for the lifting of sanctions.  All we have accomplished at this point is re moval of some of the obstacles to negotiat ing the eradication of apartheid.  Any country lifting, or intending to lift,  sanctions is undermining the efforts of the  international community. Moreover,  it  is  acting in a manner considered hostile by the  majority of the oppressed people of South  Africa.' The call for  lifting sanctions  is a  dangerous  trend, an affront to  the South  Africans who have given their lives or lan guished in prison and to the many Ameri cans who have sacrificed on their behalf.  In 1959, the A.N.C. called upon the world  to impose sanctions because apartheid was  terrorizing South Africans. We, and many  of you, struggled until 1986 when the U.S.  Congress__.:.overriding a Presidential veto-fi nally approved sanctions.  Sanctions must not be  lifted until  the  changes in South Africa are profound and  irreversible. This is defined as completion of  a constitution, following elections based on  the universally accepted proposition of one  person, one vote. That is the litmus test of  whether apartheid exists, of whether sanc tions should be lifted.  Statistics give some idea of apartheid's ef fects: 87 percent of South Africa's land be longs-by law-to the five million whites,  who also own 95 percent of the nation's in dustry. South Africa spends five  times as  much on education and health care for its  white citizens as for its black. The infant  mortality rate for white babies is nine per  thousand births; for black babies, it is 109.  The average  life expectancy for a white  South African is 72 years; for a black, 59.  But statistics cannot convey fully what it  means to live in a country where you're not  just born a baby, you're born a black, a col ored, an Indian or a white baby-and that  ",1990

699,322,11,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, with yes terday's  flag  amendment vote,  the  House of Representatives has turned  its back on the Constitution, on the  flag, and, worst of all, on the Ameri can people.  The House has  said ""no""  to  the  American Legion. It has said ""no"" to  the Veterans of Foreign Wars. It has  said ""no"" to the Paralyzed Veterans of  America. It has said ""no"" to a young  man named Gary Freeman, who col lected more than 3,000 petition signatures in support of an amendment-all  in downtown Hutchinson, KS.  And  the House-the so-called peo ple's body, has said ""no"" to the mil lions of concerned Americans who be lieve that Old Glory deserves one type  of protection only-and that is consti tutional protection.  So yes, the flag amendment did fail  in the House yesterday, but-despite  itself-the House  has  succeeded  in  amending the Constitution.  The first three words in the Consti tution's preamble are no longer ""We  the People."" They are now, sadly, We  the Congress.  With a reelection rate of more than  98  percent, with many  incumbents  running unopposed,  it is no surprise  that House Members think they can  get away with snubbing the voters of  this country.  Let us face  it: In today's Washing ton, public accountal;>ility is out. Belt way arrogance is in.  Mr. President, during the past sever al months, we have heard a  lot of  fancy legal words which confuse most  people, but which put big dollars  in  the pockets of the legal establishment.  We have heard words like ""content neutrality,""  ""symbolic  speech,""  and  ""communicative impact.""  These words may define the debate  for the American Bar Association, or  the American Trial Lawyers Associa tion, or all the ivory-tower law profes sors who somehow find the meaning  of life in the footnotes of legal briefs.  But these words do not square with  the wisdom of  the American people  who see no contradiction whatsoever  between our cherished  first  amend ment freedoms and a law prohibiting  the desecration of our Nation's most  revered symbol, our flag.  The American people know that flag  desecration is wrong. They know that  Old Glory deserves protection. And  they know that passing a constitution al amendment is the only right thing  to do.  Mr. President, the Senate will have a  vote  on  the  flag  amendment next  week. According to my tally, the vote  will be close. We are probably going to  lose, but I think the vote will be close.  But, as I see it, the choice for us in  the Senate  is crystal clear: We can  either follow the House's lead and em brace the Beltway know-it-alls or we  can embrace the will of the American  people-the  hardworking  taxpayers  and voters of this country-who want  to give Old Glory the constitutional  protection she so much deserves.  Mr. President, next week, the choice  will be ours.  Mr. President, as far as I am con cerned, this is a serious issue. It is not  a trivial issue. No one is trying to tri vialize the Constitution. Those of us  who  support  the  flag  have  been  classed as demagogs. I always thought  ",1990
700,335,11,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, in the  days since  the  flag-burning decision  came down from the Supreme Court,  there has been far too much heat and  far too little light on the topic of the  American flag.  I have listened with a heavy heart to  those whose solution to the despicable  act of the burning of the flag would be  to change our Bill of Rights.  I have also  listened to those who,  like me, have grave reservations about  tampering with our first amendment  freedoms. The more  I  listened,  the  more  I have been convinced of  the  need for a more rational and construc tive approach to what has become an  emotionally  charged  and  politically  loaded issue.  Mr President, I have come to believe  strongly that the best way to foster re spect for our flag is to ensure that no  American  is unaware of its place  in  our history or the freedoms for which  it stands. Why do we salute and pledge  our allegiance  to  it? Why  is  it dis played according to strict procedure?  Why  is any desecration of it an of fense to all of us.  The answers to these questions may  seem self-evident. Yet, how often we  take for granted the things we value  the most: family, country, flag.  The  flag  symbolizes principles we  cherish  the most-freedom,  liberty,  and individual rights. But just as those  values  sometimes  get  lost  in  the  hubbub of our daily lives, so too does  the  recognition  of  the  document  which so eloquently sets them forth,  the Bill of Rights.  During the 200 years that the Bill of  Rights has brought to life and guard ed these principles, it has never been  changed or amended; not once in 200  years. The bill of Rights has stood the  test of  time. Yet, many Americans  may not know  that or understand  why.  So, Mr. President, today I am intro ducing the Flag Education Act of 1990.  This bill would authorize the Secre tary  of Education  to  develop  and  widely disseminate educational materi als on the American flag, its history,  significance,  traditions,  and  importance as an enduring symbol of Ameri can democracy. The bill also author izes dissemination of similar materials  on the Bill of Rights.  Mr. President, since  it  is a  simple  bill, I am going to read the bill in its  entirety.  This act may be cited as the ""Flag Educa tion Act of 1990.""  SEC. 2. Educational materials.  The Secretary,  through  the Secretary's  Fund for Innovation in Education, described  in 4601 of the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act of 1965, shall develop and dis seminate  educational materials  regarding  the American flag, its history, significance,  traditions, and importance as an enduring  symbol of American freedom and democra cy; and also regarding the Bill of Rights, its  historical  development,  and meaning  to  American freedom and democracy.  Such materials shall be suitable for stu dents at all levels of education, including el ementary,  secondary,  postsecondary  and  adult education. The Secretary shall ensure  that such educational materials are widely  disseminated.  Mr. President, because we  seek  to  reach not only our children but adults  as well, these materials are to be suita ble for use, as I said, in elementary,  secondary, postsecondary,  and adult  education. This bill does not require  the Department of Education to step  into uncharted waters in the develop ment and dissemination of these mate rials.  I serve on the Education Authoriz ing Committee under  the very able  and  distinguished  chairmanship  of  Senator KENNEDY from Massachusetts.  I also have the honor and privilege of  chairing the Appropriations Subcom mittee  that appropriates  the money  for the Department of Education.  I checked into it, and I found that  the Department has been very active  in curricular guidance in other impor tant areas for over a decade. For in stance, the Department of Education  supports the dissemination of a curric ula entitled ""Facing History,"" an ex cellent program designed to teach stu dents  about  the Holocaust  and  its  impact on world history.  Mr. President, there is no develop ment nor dissemination of materials  designed to educate our young people  on the flag, its significance, traditions,  history, and importance to American  freedom and democracy. So  that  is  what this bill is designed to do. It is to  get the Secretary to go ahead and dis seminate these materials.  Mr. President, history  shows  that  patriotism,  respect for  the flag, and  adherence to constitutional principles  are best learned from the grassroots  up, not dictated from on high. If they  are not embedded in the hearts and  minds of the people, no law can make  them so.  Thomas Jefferson was one Founding  Father who repeatedly recognized the  role that education plays in strength ening this appreciation of education to  our democracy. Let me quote  Thomas Jefferson:  from  I know of no safe depository of the ulti mate powers of the society but the people  themselves. And if we think them not en lightened enough to exercise their control  with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is  not to take from them, but to inform their  discretion by education.  So the Flag Education Act of 1990  seeks not  to  take away  freedom of  speech or expression but to impart a  deep and abiding understanding of the  flag's history and importance for all  Americans.  I want to note this bill takes as its  starting point a message voiced by a  former Republican Member of  the  House of Representatives, former Con gressman Fred Schwengel, who served  Iowa's First District so well  for  so  many years. There are very few people  around here who do not know Fred  Schwengel. After  leaving Congress,  Congressman Schwengel was not con tent to leave his knowledge of this in stitution and  its history behind. As  head of the U.S. Capitol Historical So ciety, a nonprofit organization formed  in 1962, Fred has organized and pro moted  programs  which  heighten  public  awareness  of  historic  events  which  shape  the  destiny  of  our  Nation. He  and  the  society  have  spread far and wide valuable informa tion about the Congress and the Cap itol.  Mr. President,  If you have never  taken  Congressman  Schwengel's  famous tour through the Capitol, then  you have a real treat in store, and I  encourage you to do so. It is one of the  most enlightening and enjoyable expe riences you can have.  When Fred Schwengel heard  last  week the call for a flag amendment to  the Constitution, he said:  Periodically we need to be reminded of the  meaning of our national symbols, of which  the United States flag is chief. It is too easy  for us to let the flag become just a symbol  and  the Pledge of Allegiance  just words.  The recent Supreme Court ruling should  prompt us to teach the meaning of the flag  and the Pledge of Allegiance. More than an  amendment, education is the most appropri ate response to the flag issue.  That is a quote from Congressman  Fred Schwengel, president of the Cap itol Historical Society.  Once again, Fred Schwengel  is on  the right track. His words have helped  to inspire  this legislation,  just as he  has inspired me and countless others  with his words so many times before.  Fred Schwengel does not just talk,  he acts. In an effort to promote fur ther flag education, the Capitol His torical Society has introduced two new  publications and plans for new pro grams.  A poster and booklet set is now avail able entitled ""The Flag Portrait Set.""  The poster features a moving patriotic  message written by Fred Schwengel.  ",1990

702,361,11,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, for  the information of Senators let me de scribe what has been occurring until  now today and what will occur with re spect to the schedule next week.  First, two separate discussions have  been occurring. The managers of the  housing bill have been meeting with  the Secretary of Housing and Urban  Development and others in an effort  to reach a compromise on that legisla tion. I have not received a report on  the status of those discussions. I hope  they result in an agreement that per mits us to move forward on that legis lation.  I regret that we were unable to com plete action on  it  this week, but  it  became apparent as of yesterday that  we would not be  able  to  complete  action on it pending these discussions,  and therefore it is my decision to pro ceed  to other matters  in  the hopes  that. during  consideration of  these  other matters, these negotiations can  produce a positive result.  Under a previous unanimous-consent  agreement,  I  agreed  to call up  the  joint resulution dealing with flag dese cration sponsored by my friend and  colleague,  the distinguished Republi can leader, prior to the July 4 recess. I  have discussed  this on several occa sions over the past day with the distin guished Republican  leader, and  it  is  our judgment that the time and proce dure for handling this set forth in this  agreement represents the best way to  deal with the matter expeditiously and  fairly, and yet give everyone an oppor tunity to have their views expressed.  Therefore,  under  this  agreement,  the Senate will proceed on Monday to  debate the flag resolution and the var ious amendments listed thereto.  There will be no votes on Monday.  On Tuesday, each of the amendments  will be taken up in order, and there  are  four amendments.  I  have  listed  them previously;  two  are  statutory,  and two are constitutional. There will  be  40 minutes  of  debate  on  each  amendment  fallowed by a vote, and  then  final  action on  the  resolution  itself, following completion of action  on those amendments.  Now,  finally,  I have moved  to pro ceed  to the Civil Rights Act, and in  light of the objection expressed, I filed  a cloture motion on the motion to pro ceed. That cloture motion will ripen  for a vote Tuesday morning. That will  be approximately 10 o'clock. The dis tinguished Republican  leader and  I  will discuss that on Monday to deter mine the exact time that is the most  convenient for the largest number of  Senators. But it will be Tuesday morn ing.  Regardless of the outcome of that  vote, we will return to the flag matter  Tuesday afternoon following the party  caucuses, so Senators should be aware  that  there will be several votes on  Tuesday, a cloture vote in the morn ing, and then potentially five votes on  the flag  issue between 2:15 and ap proximately 6 or 7 o'clock, depending  upon whether or not all of the time is  used on those amendments.  Finally,  I  report  to my colleagues  that  the distinguished chairman of  the Judiciary Committee and his coun terpart  have  been  negotiating  for  some time now on the crime bill, and it  is my hope and expectation that we  will very shortly have an agreement to  limit the number of amendments and  the time on that bill. I hope we have it  today, but in view of the lengthy lan guage that has  just been exchanged  on the  two sides  that has  to be re viewed, we will not have that agree ment today.  But I hope and expect we will have  that early next week, possibly as early  as Monday, and that as soon as that  agreement is reached, we will seek to  obtain unanimous consent  for  that.  And following that, it is my hope to  bring up the crime bill as soon as pos sible;  if at all possible, prior  to  the  July 4 recess. That remains to be seen,  pending other matters.  So that, in conclusion, we will go off  the housing bill.  I  regret  that very  much, but I hope  that the negotia tions now underway on that bill will  produce a positive result.  We will be debating the flag issue on  Monday afternoon, and on Tuesday  afternoon, we will be debating and will  be voting on the flag  issue. And on  Tuesday morning, we will vote on a  cloture motion on the motion to pro ceed to the civil rights bill, and then  again,  in summary, hopefully  reach  agreement on and take up the crime  bill sometime during  the week next  week.  Mr. President, I am pleased to yield  to  the  distinguished  Republican  leader.  ",1990
703,361,11,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I will just  say that I think we obviously will com plete action on  the flag amendment  and any amendments thereto on Tuesday.  I do hope there will not be an  effort, as long as there are serious ne gotiations going on, to try to do some thing on the Civil Rights Act during  the Mandela visit. You know  there  must be a temptation to try to get into  this circus atmosphere that somehow  we are going to be pressured because  Mandela is addressing a  joint session  of Congress.  Let me indicate that there have been  good faith negotiations at the White  House and in my office for an hour  and a half as recently as 24 hours ago,  and  it  is my understanding we are  trying to work out a settlement so we  can pass the bill very quickly. But I  will just indicate we are not going to  be stampeded on this side of the aisle.  There are reservations on the other  side of the aisle. There are only 40some cosponsors to this legislation.  It seems to me that it is pretty obvi ous what is happening. Everyone has a  bill pending for some reason when Mr.  Mandela is addressing a  joint session  of the Congress. Maybe there is some thing that I am missing. Maybe it is  the politics of  it. But I  thought we  were trying to get a civil rights com promise negotiated with the adminis tration. I still hope that is  the case.  Maybe  by  Tuesday we  will  have  worked that out.  Obviously, the majority leader has a  perfect right to move to proceed. But I  do not want anybody  to misunder stand or to indicate that there is some  opposition to civil rights on this side  of the aisle. There is an affirmative  process under way now, but I under stand the Senator from Massachusetts  does not agree that it is positive, so he  wants  to proceed  in  this  fashion.  I  think it is a mistake. I think it could  be counterproductive. But that is the  choice the Senator has made.  ",1990
704,361,11,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President,  I  thank my colleague. Let me say that it  is my fervent hope that we will be able  to reach an agreement that is satisfac tory to all concerned. Although I have  not been a party  to  them,  I believe  that the discussions have been positive  and productive to date and that the  issues  have  been  significantly  nar rowed on that matter and that there  will, hopefully, be an agreement which  will permit us  to act  in a  relatively  concise period of  time. And  that, of  course,  is  the objective  that we  all  share.  So I hope that this does result in en acting  that  legislation  in a manner  that, if not all, then a broad consensus  of the Senate will find satisfactory. I  think  the negotiations have been  in  good faith and very positive and pro ductive up to this time, and we hope  that  they will shortly reach a  final  and positive result.  ",1990

The Clerk read as follows:  H.R. 1457  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION  1.  SHORT TITLE AND TABLE OF CON TENTS.  This Act may be cited as the ""Waste Re duction Act"".  TABLE OF CONTENTS  Sec. 1. Short title and table of contents.  Sec. 2. Findings and policy.  Sec. 3.

(a) FINDINGS.-The Congress finds that:  (1) The United States of America annually  produces millions of tons of pollution and  spends tens of billions of dollars per year  controlling it.  (2) There are significant opportunities for  industry to reduce or prevent pollution at  the source through cost-effective changes in  production, operation,  and  raw materials  use. Such changes offer industry substantial  savings in reduced raw material, pollution  control, and liability costs as well as help  protect the environment and reduce risks to  worker health and safety.  (3) The opportunities for source reduction  are often not realized because existing regu lations, and the industrial resources they re quire for compliance, focus upon treatment  and disposal, rather than source reduction;  existing regulations do not emphasize multi media management of pollution; and busi nesses need information and  technical as sistance  to overcome  institutional barriers  to  the adoption of source reduction prac tices.  (b)  PoLicY.-The Congress  hereby  de clares  it to be  the national policy of the  United States that pollution should be pre vented or reduced at the source, whenever  feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented  should be  recycled  in an environmentally  safe manner, whenever feasible; pollution  that cannot be prevented or recycled should  be  treated  in  an  environmentally  safe  manner whenever feasible; and disposal or  other release into the environment should  be employed only as a last resort and should  be conducted  in an environmentally safe  manner.  SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.  For purposes of this Act< 1) The term ""Administrator"" means the  Administrator of the Environmental Protec tion Agency.  (2) The term ""agency"" means the Envi ronmental Protection Agency.  (3) The term ""toxic chemical"" means any  toxic chemical on the list described in sec tion 313(c) of the Superfund Amendments  and Reauthorization Act of 1968.  (4) The  term  ""release"" has  the  same  meaning as provided by section 329(8) of the  Superfund Amendments and Reauthoriza tion Act of 1986.

709,387,11,Mr. GUNDERSON.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by extend ing my thanks and commendation to  the distinguished chairman of our sub committee, the gentleman from Michi gan  [Mr. KILDEEl. When  someone  asked me whether or not I wanted to  manage  this  legislation on the floor  today, I said, absolutely. This is  the  first  time I can remember of that a  Republican bill has come out of the  Committee on Education and Labor.  That is a unique and historic experi ence in and of itself, but more impor tant, I think, it truly is a sign of the  fairness and statesmanship of our col league, the gentleman from Michigan  [Mr. KILDEEl. As the gentleman from  Michigan was  telling me beforehand,  he easily could have  taken this bill,  made it a committee bill, except that  he chose to be fair to the gentleman  from New Jersey [Mr. RINALDO] as the  original author. The gentleman from  New Jersey [Mr. RINALDO] and I both  thank the gentleman for that kind act  of generosity.  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to lead  the effort on the floor today for quick  passage of House Concurrent Resolu tion 333,  legislation  to  express  the  sense  of  Congress  concerning  the  White House Conference on Aging.  In April, I was visited in my office by  Barbara Thoni and Mary Simpson of  the Barron County Office on Aging.  They traveled all the way to Washing ton from Barron, WI, simply  to ex press their support for congressional  action on this issue. I'm very pleased  today to be able not only to make good  on my promise to them to support the  bill, but to go a step further by leading  the floor effort to pass it.  Why is this legislation so important  to  senior  citizens  advocacy  groups?  Why would my constituents travel so  far to express their views on it? Be cause without passage of the bill, the  chance exists that we would miss hold ing  a White House Conference on  Aging for the first time in over four  decades.  The first White House Conference  on Aging was held in 1951, when Presi dent Truman invited groups to Wash ington for discussions on issues of im portance to seniors. Since that time, a  conference has been held once every  10  years,  in  1961,  1971,  and  1981.  These conferences have established a  tradition  of  nonpartisan  dialog  on  issues  affecting  senior citizens. The  conferences involve the full participa tion of individuals, State and local gov ernments, and public and private orga nizations.  Are  the conferences useful?  In a  word-yes. Past conferences a,re cred ited with contributing  to  the enact ment of  the Medicare and Medicaid  Programs, the establishment of a cost of-living-allowance  [COLA]  index for  Social Security beneficiaries, and en actment of the Older Americans Act  which established the Administration  on Aging.  The administration has not  ruled  out holding a White House Conference  on Aging in 1991. Unfortunately how ever,  the administration has not yet  indicated to our seniors that they can  count on such a conference next year.  This  legislation  lends an  important  bridge between concerned seniors and  the administration.  And 194 Members of the Congress  have cosponsored House Concurrent  Resolution 333. While  the President  has the authority to convene a confer ence next year, our bill is a bipartisan  effort to register the strong support of  Congress for the conference. Our sen iors deserve this opportunity. And the  numerous  advocacy  organizations  across  the country-like  the Barron  County Office on Aging in my area are gearing up for this opportunity to  focus efforts on  the aging  into  the  1990's.  Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of  my time to the gentleman from Iowa  [Mr. TAUKE], a member of the subcom mittee, who has worked long and hard  on this and other Older Americans Act  programs.  ",1990
710,387,11,Mr. TAUKE.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  my  colleague,  the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin, for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I want to take just a  moment to seize  this opportunity to  focus  some  attention on what  the  agenda might be for the White House  Conference on Aging in 1991.  There are two issues that I think are  critical  that should be addressed  in  that conference that have not been re ceiving  as much  attention  as  they  should. The first is the issue of equity  for older women under the Social Se curity Program. The gentleman from  New Jersey [Mr. HUGHES]  is chairman  of the Committee on Aging and Re tirement Income, of which I am the  ranking member. In that subcommit tee, we have been looking at the ques tion  of  Social  Security  equity  for  women. There is no question but that  during the time when the Social Secu rity Program was put together that we  had a much different kind of structure  in our society than we do  today. At  that  time we  had  the  traditional  family. Father goes  to work, mother  stays at home with the children and  cares for the children.  Obviously, a lot has changed in soci ety  today and we do not have very  many families  that any  longer meet  that traditional framework or that tra ditional model. As  a  result, we  see  many inequities in the Social Security  Program that are particularly harmful  to those women who leave the work  force for a period of time in order to  provide care for children or for sen iors, to those women who are divorced  and to those women who are widowed  at a relatively early age.  In our subcommittee, for example,  we  spent some  time  looking at  the  question of  the dropout years. The  dropout years, as they are called, are  years when a woman would leave the  work  force  in order  to  care  for  a  family, maybe it will be a child, maybe  a spouse, maybe an ill parent.  Now, if a woman has worked for 35  years, but in the midst of that 35 years  maybe took out 7 years to care for an  elderly parent or a child, and there is  another who has also worked 35 years  and they have had identical earnings  records during those 35 years, but the  second one did not take time out to  care for a spouse or family member,  the first woman who did the caring  would  find  that her Social Security  benefits when she  retired would be  much less than the second one. Why?  Because she would have  those zero  years, those dropout years, that would  be averaged in with her earnings over  the previous 35 or the other 35 years,  and  that would mean her  average  annual earnings would decline.  0 1340  Mr. Speaker, we should not so bla tantly penalize people who are put in  a position where they have to care for  individuals. If anything, we should be  encouraging it, not discouraging that  kind of activity. That is an issue that  needs to be addressed.  It seems  to me  the White House  Conference on Aging should spend a  little time focusing on that.  It has been very difficult  to get  public-policy makers to focus on the  issue here in the Congress.  The second issue that I think needs  attention  is  the health care  issue.  I  serve on  the Health Subcommittee,  and we spend a lot of time looking at  the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.  But we are always looking at them in  terms of the annual budget resolution.  We pass a budget resolution, then we  try to adjust the Medicare and Medic aid  Programs  through  the Budget  Reconciliation Act to meet the goals  ",1990

715,413,11,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President, last year  I voted for the Flag Protection Act. I  voted for that law because I believe  flag burning  is  reprehensible. And I  voted for that law because I believed  that it was the best way to protect this  cherished symbol of our Nation.  But earlier this month-by a slim 5to-4 margin-the Supreme Court ruled  that the act violated the first amend ment. I disagree with this decision. I  agree with  the four Supreme Court  justices who said that we passed a con stitutional law.  Of course, people should be free to  criticize our country. But even symbol ic speech has its legal limits. We can  not  denounce  our Government  by  shouting obscenities on the radio or by  planting a bomb in the Capitol. And  you should not be allowed to do it by  desecrating the American flag.  I  hope-and expect-the Supreme  Court will someday reverse its recent  decision: One that I believe no other  court  in  our  history would  have  reached. As Chief Justice Rehnquist  said  in Texas versus Johnson, even  free-speech  advocates  like  Earl  Warren and Hugo Black agreed that  we could punish flag desecration with out breaching  the  first amendment.  For all these reasons, I support the ef forts to pass a bill that would make  flag  burning  illegal  if  it  threatens  public safety.  But today we are considering some thing far more drastic than a simple  statute: We are contemplating carving  a slice out of the first amendment. Ev eryone knows that flag burners are in fantile and misguided. Yet altering the  Constitution to prohibit flag burning  would be just as bad. Adopting an as terisk to the Bill of Rights would be  unprecedented,  unwise,  unnecessary,  and unfortunate.  First, this constitutional amendment  is unprecedented. Two centuries ago  the Congress pledged  that  it would  ""make no law ... abridging the free dom of speech."" For all these years through two worlds wars, a depression,  urban riots, even a bloody Civil War the first amendment has needed no  repair, caused no calamity.  In  fact,  just the opposite is true: It has been  the guardian of our freedom. Even in  the face of the most offensive political  expressions, Congress has kept faith  with the framers and never amended  the Bill of Rights. It would be a tragic  irony if we celebrated the 200th birth day  of  this  historic  document  by  changing it for the very first time.  Second,  this constitutional amend ment  is unwise.  It would  inevitably  open the door to ever more damaging  changes in the first amendment. If we  protect  the flag  today, how can we  refuse tomorrow to extend similar pro tection  to  the Declaration of  Inde pendence-if burning this symbol be comes  fashionable? And what about  the Constitution  and  the Bill  of  Rights? After all, soldiers and Sena tors do not take an oath to def end the  flag. We take an oath to defend some thing even more important: The Con stitution of the United States.  That Constitution and  the Bill of  Rights protect speech-even  though  we may disagree with  it and  even  though we may find it offensive. The  point is simply this: If we give anyone  the right  to determine what speech  should be protected, we give someone  the right to take free speech away.  Third,  this  constitutional  amend ment is unnecessary. Some harms are  so entrenched, so pervasive, so threat ening to our character as a country,  that they demand a constitutional so lution. But flag burning does not rise or fall-to that level. A few isolated in stances of flag burning by a few fool ish extremists hardly reaches constitu tional proportions.  And let me assure you: This fad will  soon be out of fashion. Once the nov elty of flag burning on television news casts fades from view, this irresponsi ble activity will fall into historical ob livion. That is exactly what it will de serve.  And  fourth,  this  constitutional  amendment is unfortunate. For more  than two centuries, we have handled  our liberty with care. We should not  allow the foul air of political expedi ence to sully the constitutional under pinnings of our Nation. Nor should we  permit the glare of a television camera  or the fear of a 30-second spot to eat  away at the foundation of democracy.  What have our politics become if a  vote not to alter the Bill of Rights is  characterized as a lack of patriotism?  It used  to go without  saying  that  people loved the flag, honored Amer ica, and revered the Constitution. It  still should. Our flag has the character  to withstand any challenge;  I hope  this body has the courage to do so as  well.  Finally, Mr. President,  the Bill of  Rights is a beacon to freedom-seekers  around the world. Students at Tianan men Square, statesmen in Lithuania,  and  those struggling against oppres sion in Burma do not have a bill of  rights. But the Bill of Rights embodies  exacctly what  they are fighting  for:  The right to speak against their gov ernments; the right to promote causes  which may be unpopular;  and  the  right  to engage  in political activity  that their society does not necessarily  sanction.  As  the walls of oppression crumble  throughout the world, we should not  retrench our Constitution at home.  We ought to remain a model for indi vidual rights, free speech, and toler ance.  Mr. President, the flag is fireproof,  No one can destroy this symbol of our  collective  aspirations. The Constitu tion, however,  is much more fragile.  Flag burning is a truly abhorrent act:  We should denounce  it, condemn  it,  oppose it. But we cannot protect the  flag by burning the Bill of Rights.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",1990

731,439,11,Mr. COATS.," Mr. President, in just a  few days across  the country we will  witness summer's annual outpouring  of festive patriotism.  It is  somehow appropriate  that  in  America we choose to celebrate serious  virtues and historic sacrifice with the  stuff of our everyday lives, with barbe cues and beer and picnics. Each year  our July 4th events prove that sinceri ty need not always be solemn.  And  I can attest  that one of  the  most  exciting  and well-attended  of  those events will  take place  in  the  center of Indianapolis.  For the past 13 years, WFMS radio,  the Indianapolis Jaycees, !NB Nation al Bank, Claypool Court and the Com mission  for Downtown have hosted  the ""Fourthfest."" Each year they have  brought the best in country music to  over 200,000 Hoosiers at the War Me morial downtown. At the end of the  concert, a huge American flag is un furled and a spectacular fireworks dis play begins.  This year, the Fourthfest will kick off with the presentation of the 1990  Hoosier Pride Award,  sponsored by  Claypool Court. The recipient is Jim  Davis, creator of Garfield the Cat.  Last year I was fortunate to partici pate in the event, and it exceeded all  expectations. I want to express the en thusiasm and thanks of all Hoosiers to  the sponsors of Fourthf est, and wish  them their usual spectacular success.e  COSPONSORING S. 2675  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise  today to cosponsor S. 2675, a bill to  direct the Census Bureau to enumer ate members of the Armed Forces sta tioned outside the United States ac cording to their home of record, or the  place where they enlisted.  The Commerce Department and the  Census Bureau  recently  announced  their intention to count military per sonnel based on their last residence of  6 months or longer, rather than their  home of record. The proposal would  result  in placing  a  disproprortinate  amount of people in States that have  large military facilities,  to the exclu sion of  those  that do not. Because  these persons are counted for reappor tionment  purposes,  this  inaccuracy  could affect the representation of mil lions of Americans. By counting over seas military personnel according  to  their home of record,  these persons  will be accurately distributed through out the country.  Overseas military  personnel were  last included in the census in 1970. At  that time, they were counted accord ing  to  their home of  record. There fore, the new method proposed by the  Commerce  Department  and  the  Census Bureau  is a  clear departure  from past Census Bureau policies.  Counting overseas military person nel according to their home of record  is  the  fairest  and most  effective  method. I urge my colleagues to sup port this measure.e  APPOINTMENT BY THE  PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE  ",1990

This bill con tains  a  vitally  important  provision  which I coauthored that will end dis criminatory tax treatment suffered by  some  transportation workers  in  the  State of Washington. My provision  provides that rail and motor carrier  transportation workers will only have  to pay State taxes  to  their State of  residence.  I first learned of this problem sever al years ago from railroad employees  who  reside  in Spokane. During  the  course  of  their day,  these workers  would work on a train passing through  Idaho and Montana. Suddenly, these  employees, and in some cases retirees,  were receiving notices for back taxes  from our neighboring States for  the  portion of  the employees' work day  when the train travelled through the  neighboring States.  I  felt  that  this  action was  extremely discriminatory  and amounted to double taxation for  Washington State workers.  Two weeks ago, I made a difficult de cision to support the President's veto  ",1990
740,465,11,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President, we  all know  that the world's forest  re sources, particularly in the tropics, are  fast disappearing. At the recent Inter parliamentary  Conference  on  the  Global Environment, I cochaired the  working group on deforestation and  desertification.  I  said  there, quoting  the Food and Agricultural Organiza tion, that the world was losing 54 acres  of  tropical  fores ts per minute,  that  those acres were being cleared for ag riculture,  grazing,  fuelwood,  human  settlement, for export and for other  purposes, and that those lost trees and  other forest resources were not being  replaced.  Now, just 2 months after our confer ence, I find that I must revise what I  said  there about  the extent of  the  damage to our forests. Unfortunately,  it is even worse than we thought. Ac cording  to  a  recent  report by  the  World  Resources  Institute,  whose  work I rely on a lot for keeping myself  abreast of the world forestry situation,  we are losing our tropical forests at an  average  rate of 85  acres a minute.  That is very depressing.  This  forest  destruction  forever  denies to humankind the benefits de rived  from  species  of  animals  and  plants that disappear in this process,  including  especially  plant  species  which may be essential for improved  food crops, as well as those which may  form the basis for biotechnological ap plication, medicine, and other scientif ic uses.  Land cleared through deforestation  is in many regions unsuitable for ongo ing agriculture and exhausted within a  few years. So cutting down trees in the  tropics often leads  to no permanent  gain, but rather to a cycle of floods,  disruption of hydrological cycles, soil  erosion, and, ultimately,  in some  in stances, desertification.  Very  importantly-and  this  is  the  area in which I am particularly con cerned-deforestation, especially from  burning, also results in significant re lease of carbon dioxide into the atmos phere, thus contributing to the green house effect that causes global warm ing.  The reasons for these forest losses  are, as we know, very complex. They  have to do, in part, with world trade,  international debt, and other macro economic causes. But these losses also  stem from poverty,  from population  growth, from pollution pressures, and  from  inequities  in  land distribution.  These factors lead to precipitate and  usually  counterproductive  landclear ing  for marginal  agriculture.  It is  counterproductive because, after a few  years of crops, the cleared land loses  its nutrients and becomes barren and  useless.  We are talking about lots and lots of  very poor people who have  to work  very hard for their daily bread, and  who, understandably most likely never  heard of biodiversity or global warm ing, and, if they did, would most likely  say they have more important things  to think about.

743,478,11,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, I ask to  make a  rhetorical statement of  the  Senator from Idaho. He understands  he cannot do both. He cannot support  the Helms amendment and support  the President at the same time. He can  support either one or the other.  If he  supports Helms,  then  the  President's amendment  is dead. It is  done, gone, over,  finished, defeated.  And if Helms loses, then the President  has a possibility. Just so we under stand on this vote: A vote for Helms is  a vote against the President's amend ment.  Mr. President, how much  mains?  The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr.  LIEBERMAN). The Senator from Dela ware has 9 minutes 17 seconds remain ing.  ",1990
744,478,11,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President,  quite  frankly, we have been through this ex ercise a number of  times before on  court stripping. If the Helms amend ment were adopted, none of the laws,  indeed, no  flag burning  law at all,  could ever be reviewed by the Supreme  Court.  Yesterday, I gave several examples  of the kinds of law I believe the Presi dent's proposed amendment would au thorize. None of them would be able to  be reviewed by the Supreme Court of  the United States. I guess folks might  say, well, what difference does  that  make?  Let me  tell you what it means. It  means  that we will  have  entered  waters in this country that have never  been entered.  If the Helms amend ment is adopted, a State could pass a  law prohibiting blacks from buying or  waving American flags or a city coun cil could do the same. Any local juris diction could do it. There would be no  challenging that law in the court and  once passed,  it  is unreviewable, un challengeable by anyone in a Federal  court.  A State could pass a law saying that  only veterans had the right to wave  the flag or pin the flag on their lapel  or do anything at all with the flag.  Nothing could be done about  that.  The city of Berkeley could pass a law  saying that only veterans cannot wave  the flag, and it would not be reviewa ble by the Federal court.  The Senator asked a rhetorical ques tion earlier. He said he is not asking  for a constitutional amendment. What  is he asking to eliminate? What are we  so worried about? I think it might be  appropriate-based on the number of  items  that  the Senator from North  Carolina and others  feel distasteful  based on Supreme Court decisions,  why not  just eliminate  the Court?  Why not, since we do not seem to like  its makeup, we do not seem to like the  way  it votes on a number of  issues,  just pass  a  law  and  eliminate  the  Court? In effect, you do that if you  continue to just whittle away at major  chunks of its jurisdiction.  Mr. President, I will cease here be cause I know my colleague from Penn sylvania wants another minute. I want  to try to accommodate him as best as I  can. As well, I was told my colleague  from Massachusetts wishes to speak.  I  hope we would overwhelmingly  reject  this amendment.  It certainly  will satisfy no one.  By  the way,  if  this  amendment  passes, then Gregory Johnson will be  able  to go back and do under  the  Texas  statute  exactly what he did  before, and it would still be protected  unless Texas changed that law. You  could burn the flag in Texas but not  Oklahoma. That may cause some in teresting dilemmas. But at any rate, I  will not go into all the bizarre exam ples that could in fact arise as a conse quence of stripping the court of juris diction over the first amendment and  particularly flag burning.  I yield to my colleague from Penn sylvania, who  said earlier he would  like 1 minute.  ",1990
745,478,11,Mr.  SPECTER.," Mr.  President,  I  thank my  distinguished  colleague  from Delaware.  Mr. President, I had made an argu ment a few moments ago that under  Marbury versus Madison, the Supreme  Court was the final arbiter of constitu tional decisions, and  then I had re f erred to an extended discuss~on I had  with Chief Justice Rehnquist in the  confirmation  proceedings where  he  raised the issue there might be some  power in Congress  to withhold some  jurisdiction, but Chief Justice Rehn quist said that that power could not  apply under any circumstance to the  first amendment.  The  distinguished  Senator  from  North Carolina then came to the floor  and asked this Senator if I had read  the opinions by Chief Justice Rehn quist, and I said I had. I would like at  this time to refer specifically to Chief  Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Texas  versus Johnson where at page 9 the  Chief Justice says this:  But the Court insists that the Texas stat ute prohibiting the public burning of the  American  Flag  infringes  on  respondent  Johnson's freedom of expression. Such free dom, of course, is not absolute.  So here conclusively and categorical ly Chief Justice Rehnquist deals with  the first amendment  issue and says  that  the  first amendment does not  cover flag burning. And Chief Justice  Rehnquist then goes on to discuss the  Chaplinsky case, which I had referred  to earlier and the Schenk case, so that  there is no question but what Chief  Justice  Rehnquist  regarded  Texas  versus Johnson, a flag-burning case, as  one which was  arguably under  the  first amendment. But the Chief Jus tice said the first amendment did not  go that far.  We are referring again to the ques tion  raised by Senator HELMS  as  to  whether I had read the Chief Justice's  opinion. He did not write an opinion in  U.S.  versus Eichman. That opinion  was written instead by one of his col leagues.  The opinion was written by Justice  Stevens and, at page 5 of U.S. versus  Eichman, Justice Stevens again consid ers the flag burning in terms of ""free dom of expression protected by  the  first amendment embraces not only  the freedom to communicate particu lar ideas but also the right to commu nicate  them effectively. That  right,  however, is not absolute.""  So there is no doubt that the Ste vens opinion, joined in by Chief Jus tice Rehnquist, again considers  flag  burning within the context of the first  amendment. So it is abundantly clear  even with the question raised by the  distinguished  Senator  from  North  Carolina  that  this  is a  first amend ment issue; that you cannot take away  the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court  on first amendment issues.  But again I say, for other reasons in  a floor statement which I have made, I  support the amendment to protect the  flag,  and certainly strongly disagree  with  taking away the  jurisdiction of  the Supreme Court on such a funda mental matter.  I  again  thank my colleague  Delaware.  ",1990

756,491,11,Mr.  LEVIN.," Madam  President,  I  thank the Chair.  I  thank my friend  from Delaware.  Madam President, I believe we can  and should protect both the flag and  the first amendment; the flag because  it is a unique symbol of our Nation,  and the first amendment because it is  a unique testament to freedom.  My preference was to have done that  by Federal statute. I believe that such  a statute would have struck the best  balance between  the clear desire of  most Americans to protect the Ameri can flag from burning or other forms  of mutilation, and the clear need to  protect  the  cherished  liberties  for  which it stands.  I had hoped that the Supreme Court  would uphold the statute that I and 60  other Senators voted for in this Cham ber a few months ago. I voted for that  statute because it would have given us  national statute protecting the symbol  of our national unity. It provided for  that protection, and yet had no impact  on the first amendment because the  motive, intent, and purpose of the flag  burning was irrelevant. The action of  the burning was prohibited regardless  of intent or effect.  However, as we all know, that stat ute was recently declared unconstitu tional by a five to four decision of the  Supreme Court. So today the Senate is  faced with a choice: Do we continue to  pursue the protection of the American  flag or, do we say that the Supreme  Court's most recent decision striking  down a statute passed by a majority in  Congress should be the end of our ef forts?  I said before the passage of the stat ute last year, and I still believe, that if  the Supreme Court struck down that  statute, then we should take the next  step of basically authorizing that same  statute by a carefully worded constitu tional amendment.  That is why I am a cosponsor of the  Biden substitute to Senate Joint Reso lution 332, which offers  the Senate  the opportunity to vote on a carefully  constructed, narrowly drawn constituto  the  protect  tional  amendment  American flag.  The Biden substitute does that. I am  afraid  that Senate Joint Resolution  332 does not. But I am not ready to  give up on efforts to protect the Amer ican flag. Neither am I  ready to say  that the only way to cross through a  forest  is  to  fell  every  tree  in  that  forest, when cutting a narrow path  would just as effectively provide pas sage.  I believe we should pass a narrowly  drawn constitutional amendment, the  Biden substitute, one that protects the  flag, while also carrying out our re sponsibilities  to protect  the  liberties  that  it  represents.  I  believe,  as do  many people  I have spoken with  in  Michigan and here, that Senate Joint  Resolution  332  is  not  a  narrowly  drawn  constitutional  amendment  to  protect the flag. Instead of moving us  carefully along a path to protecting  the flag, Senate Joint Resolution 332  will weaken  important safeguards of  the Bill of Rights.  First,  let us  look at  the  face of  Senate Joint Resolution 332.  In  its  preamble  the  resolution  states,  ""Whereas, physical desecration may  include, but is not limited to such acts  as,"" and then it goes on to describe a  number of acts.  Madam President, on its face,  this  resolution does not say ""what you see  is what you get,"" but rather in effect,  it says ""what you see is an inkling, a  taste, of what you might get."" On its  face, Senate Joint Resolution 332 is an  invitation to the Federal Government  and to the States to go broadly beyond  the resolution's own words.  In addition, Senate Joint Resolution  332 states that, ""Physical desecration""  includes ""displaying the flag in a con temptuous manner."" Madam  Presi dent, I agree that there are some ac tions which most people would con clude are examples of ""displaying the  flag in a contemptuous manner,"" but  there are certainly other instances of  displaying the flag which are obvious ly open  to wide  interpretation as  to  whether the manner is contemptuous  or not.  Second,  the  testimomy offered by  the  Justice Department  last  year  before the Senate Judiciary Commit tee  included numerous references  to  the broad flexibility that the Federal  Government and States would have in  enacting  legislation pursuant  to  an  amendment such as Senate Joint Res olution 332.  On August 1, 1989, William Barr, As sistant U.S. Attorney General in the  Office of Legal Counsel, stated the fol lowing on page 13 of his testimony re garding  the Dole-Dixon amendment  which was identical with Senate Joint  Resolution 332:  The amendment would define the frame work within which the legislative authority  of the Congress and the States could be exercised. Within  this  framework, however,  the Congress and  the States would have  wide  latitude  to  prohibit  that  conduct  toward the flag that they believe deserves  proscription.  On page 14, the Assistant Attorney  General said:  While we believe  the amendment would  certainly permit the legislatures to define  ""flag"" in this <narrow) manner, legislatures  would be free to adopt a broader definition,  as Congress itself has done.  On page 17, Mr. Barr stated, ""There  are an  infinite number of  forms of  desecration. I will not attempt even a  representative listing here.""  On page 20 of his testimony, the As sistant Attorney General concluded by  saying,  ""By way  of  summary,  the  Dole-Dixon amendment confers  sub stantial discretion on Congress  and  the States to determine precisely the  degrading acts  toward our flag  that  are to be prohibited.""  Madam President,  ""wide  latitude,""  ""broader  definition,""  ""infinite  number,"" ""substantial discretion,"" are  not words normally used to describe a  narrow  constitutional  amendment.  But those are the very words that the  administration used  last year  in de scribing a constitutional amendment,  which is identical to Senate Joint Res olution 332, which is before us today.  What is particularly ironic is that on  June 21 of this year, in his testimony  before the Judiciary Committee, ",1990
757,491,11,Mr.  J.," Michael Lutting, Acting Assistant  Attorney General of  the Office  of  Legal  Counsel,  stated  that  ""the  amendment is appropriately narrow in  scope."" He also stated that ""Congress  and the States would have to deter mine which types of physical desecra tion  to  for bid. The  range of  their  choice is fairly narrow, because physi cal desecration entails actual contact  with the flag.""  Madam President,  in  less  than 1  year,  the  administration  spokesmen  have shifted  in  their description of  what can be prohibited under  this  amendment from ""infinite number"" to  ""fairly narrow."" The first amendment  has endured for 200 years, and now we  are asked to consider an amendment,  Senate Joint Resolution 332, which  has  traveled at warp  speed,  in  less  than 1 year, from being described by  the administration in terms of being  ""infinite""  to being described by  the  same  administration  as  ""fairly  narrow.''  I find it hard to understand how an  amendment capable of such elastic in terpretations by the same administra tion over such a short period of time  can  be  referred  to  as  ""carefully  drawn.''  One final point, Madam President,  with respect to the testimony offered  on behalf of Senate Joint Resolution  332 by the administration, which high lights its potential for broad interpre tation and application. As Mr. Barr  ",1990
758,517,11,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today  to  introduce  the American  Family Enterprise Preservation Act. I  think it is no secret to Members of the  Senate, and to Americans in general,  that a high percentage or our popula tion earn their living working in or for  small businesses in this country, and  that most of the small businesses in  the country are owned by families.  Family-owned businesses are the es sence of  the American dream. Hard  work,  resourcefulness,  and pride  in  doing the job well are typical charac teristics that we find in family busi nesses. Family businesses are an at tractive venture of Americans to enter  into and try to work for their own ben efit, pleasure, and sense of accomplish ments.  I assert  to you  today,  that it has  been families and their businesses that  have been  the bedrock of a  strong  economy  in  the United States since  the very beginnings of this Nation.  Mr. President, due to the present tax  laws however, a family's business ac complishments are heavily taxed upon  the death of the majority owner of the  business, which exposes many of these  small businesses to what can lead to fi nancial collapse, particularly in the ag ricultural community.  I would venture to guess that well  over 90 percent of the farms in Amer ica are operated as family businesses.  Most of those farms are land rich and  cash poor. So if someone dies in the  family, and if the farm is of any value  and substantial size, it forces liquida tion or heavy debt in order to pay off  the tax collector.  One of  the  reasons  that we have  seen such a concentration of newspa per ownership in America,  is because  of the death tax laws in this country  that have forced families to sell local  newspapers to bigger corporations so  they can pay off the debt taxes.  Family-owned businesses are not an  American  institution  that Congress  should contemplate taxing into extinc tion. Family businesses provide  jobs,  revenues  to the Treasury, and prod ucts and services that are essential to  the well-being of America. It is by no  means easy that a family business can  be built. And what is really tragic is  that Congress has, through its infinite  wisdom, created a  taxing system we  now have that imposes death taxes in  this country. It is crushing the back bone of America-the family business.  Family business should not have to be  sold in order to pay off the death tax.  Mr. President, if American Govern ment has evolved to the point of de stroying such a  fundamental part of  society, I feel one of the most impor tant and vital legacies we possess will  be lost forever. Extremely high estate  taxes strike at the heart of the Ameri can dream. More than half of all businesses qualify as family businesses. As  I  said earlier,  in agriculture  it  is a  much higher percentage.  Incredibly,  as  the citizens  in  this  country are clamoring for  tax relief  across the board from the income tax  system and from property taxes,  the  Federal  Government  continues  to  impose no less than 17 different tax  rates on estates. They range from 18  to 55 percent. This often causes the  family of the deceased business owner  to sell the assets of the business just  to pay the Federal taxes.  The legislation I intend to introduce  today, which  I  call  the American  Family Enterprise Preservation Act,  will do several things. I fell these are  all essential to help ensure the surviv al of thousands of family businesses in  the country, and not only the survival  for the business, but the survival for  the people  that work  in those busi nesses, who enjoy working in a small  company where they have direct con tact with the owners, and can become  part of a team, with a family that op erates a business.  First, this bill would repeal section  2036(c) of the IRS Code by eliminat ing the estate tax freeze. That means  that the heir will only pay taxes on  the portion of the estate that is actu ally inherited. They will not have to  pay capital gains taxes on the growth  of the company from  the time that  they  assumed  ownership  until  the  owner  is  deceased,  in  the  interim  period.  For example, if a father would give  or  sell  a  business  to  his  children,  during the interim period of, 25 years  before the time the father might be  deceased, and  the business were  to  enjoy  a  great deal of growth  and  expand in its value, under current tax  law, upon  the death of  the original  owner of the business, they will have  to go back, recoup, and pay taxes on  the growth that took place even after  that person moved out of the business.  I feel this estate tax freeze will be  received  favorably.  I  am  confident  that at least this portion of this bill  will be passed this year.  Second is to reduce the number of  tax brackets  from  17  tax  brackets  down to 2. This is the same as the top  income  tax brack.et. It would be  in dexed for inflation, and the top brack et would be 28 percent. Why we  tax  people at 55 percent on an estate is  beyond my imagination. It is pure con fiscation of property to tax anyone at  55 percent, particularly if they have  worked,  been  thrifty,  reinvested  in  their business, and paid taxes on the  profits of  that business  throughout  the years of building it. To have the  heirs upon their death pay at 55 per cent tax rate is absolutely outrageous,  and should be stopped. We should not  have this inequity taking place in the  United States. My  legislation would  ",1990

762,543,11,Mr. BRYAN.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to congratulate one of Nevada's  most valuable  citizens. Ms.  Pamela  Calhoun, a teacher at Diedrichsen Ele mentary School, has been named our  Nation's 64th Point of Light by Presi dent Bush for her service to the com munity of Sparks and  the State of  Nevada. I want to join with our Presi dent and salute Ms. Calhoun for her  efforts to help make Nevada energy ef ficient and to preserve our State's nat ural beauty.  Mr.  President,  Pamela Calhoun's  outstanding work for energy conserva tion first became known to me 4 years  ago. As a result of her success, I  re quested as Governor, that she teach  other Nevada educators about energy  conservation to help spread the mes sage that each of us can help make  Nevada a more beautiful and energy  efficient State. Ms. Calhoun  seized  that opportunity and as a result, her  efforts have developed into a commu nity based curriculum  that  reaches  many more students than she could  possibly reach on her own.  But the core of her work remains a  group called ''Energy Awareness in the  Northern Nevada Community"" at Die drichsen Elementary School. This or ganization consists of a core of 50 stu dents  in grades K-12, who,  in turn,  mobilize a student population of more  than 600 young people. Students  in  the group work to educate the public  on issues such as pollution, littering,  recycling, conservation and energy al ternatives. They hold community recy cling  and  litter cleanups, distribute  educational fliers about pollution, and  publicize  energy  alternatives. More over, the students do not confine their  efforts to the Sparks community, but  have expanded  to surrounding rural  areas as well. Ms. Calhoun's other ac tivities include working with her fifth  grade science class, and the Science Energy Club  for sixth graders. She  also helps with energy fairs, retreats  and awards ceremonies, such as  the  one today for which she brought her  award winning students to Washing ton.  Mr. President, at a time when we, as  a nation, are finally coming to grips  with a scarcity of both financial and  natural resources, it is increasingly im portant that we harness the energy of  our citizens. The efforts of Ms. Pamela  Calhoun and her students,  together  with  the  support  of  the Washoe  County School District and its super intendent, Dr. Marvin Moss,  have  served to keep Nevada as beautiful and  prosperous as ever. I want to congratu late Ms. Calhoun and all  those who  have helped this cause, for their in valuable work.e  BUMPER CROP OF MARIJUANA  e Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President,  my colleagues well know  that April  showers bring May flowers, but this  spring  in Kentucky  the  rains have  brought much more. For marijuana  growers  in  the eastern part of my  State,  the wet weather has been a  boon for their illegal business.  An article that appeared in the Cou rier-Journal entitled ""Authorities Face  Bumper Crop of Marijuana"" best ex plains  the challenges Kentucky  law  enforcement  officials  face  this  summer. Pot plants, usually measuring  18  inches high  in early June, have  been found to measure in excess of 4  feet. As Trooper Darrell Tolson stated:  ""It's going to be a great year for mari juana. We might even have a bumper  crop.""  I would  like to point out that the  tireless efforts of our law enforcement  agencies and the Civil Air Patrol are  vital to the eradication to this illegal  crop.  Mr. President, I ask that the article  appear in the RECORD for the benefit  of all my colleagues.  The article follows:  [From the Lexington <KY> Herald-Leader,  June 11, 1990)  AUTHORITIES FACE BUMPER CROP OF  MARIJUANA  <By Frank Langfitt)  The war on drugs faces a somewhat larger  opponent  this  summer  in Eastern Ken tucky.  Wet weather in May and early June  is  producing healthier marijuana crops from  Clay to Lawrence counties, said state police,  U.S. Forest Service agents and marijuana  growers.  A farmer in the Crane Creek section of  Clay County says his 600 marijuana plants  are bushier and 4 to 5 inches taller than  usual for this time of year.  ""The wet weather is a blessing,"" said the  unemployed coal miner, who asked that his  name not be used.  Trooper Darrell Tolson, who  is used  to  finding  the  illegal plant 18  inches high  during early June, has found some measur ing 4 and 5 feet tall in Breathitt County.  ""It's going to be a great year for marijua na,"" Tolson said, ""We might even have a  bumper crop.""  Rain fell 22 days in May in the region, for  a total of 5.08 inches-1.56 inches more than  normal, said the National Weather Service  at Jackson in Breathitt County. As of Satur day, 2.56 inches in rain had fallen in June.  Normal accumulation for the month is 3.78  inches.  Rain has lightened the workload for mari juana growers, who often have to carry jugs  of water through the mountains to irrigate  their fields. But for some law enforcement  officials, it has been a headache.  Cloudy weather has grounded airplanes  the U.S. Forest Service uses to spot marijua na fields among the bright, green stands of  hickory walnut and red maple in the Daniel  Boone National Forest.  Agents and their vehicles have had to con tend with muddy mountain  trails, often  leaving tracks that tip off farmers, said Bill  Dixon, a special agent for the Forest Serv ice.  The Forest Service,  the U.S. Drug En forcement Administration state police and  local  sheriffs' offices began cutting and  burning marijuana plants in early May. The  Forest Service has budgeted $300,000 and  plans to use at least 100 people to cut down  the plants during the summer and the fall  harvest seasons.  Leslie and Clay counties' sheriffs' depart ments report cutting at least 1,000 plants  apiece.  The federal state and local task force said  it cut 596,512 plants last year in Kentucky,  one of the five major marijuana producers  in the United States. Only Hawaii and Mis souri exceeded the Bluegrass State in mari juana cut, said John Preston Sutton, chief  of the Cannabis investigation section of the  federal drug agency.  Most of the marijuana cut in the state was  grown  in  and  around  the  660,000-acre  Daniel Boone forest, which runs through 21  Eastern Kentucky counties. It grows more  marijuana plants than any national forest  in the country.  A 10-foot-high plant in Eastern Kentucky  produces  about  a  pound  of marijuana,  which  can  sell wholesale  for  $1,000  to  $1,500, growers said.  About 90 percent of the crop  is sent to  cities in the South and Midwest, said Andy  Sadler, an agent for the Forest Service.  Eastern Kentucky farmers primarily grow  marijuana on the ridges and slopes of the  Cumberland Mountains  to  hide  it  from  police and  thieves. The steep mountains  drain quickly, lowering the risk of root rot.  While  the marijuana crop  thrives, some  other agriculture in Eastern Kentucky con tinues to suffer.  Farmers have had trouble reaching their  fields to replant tobacco, and hay is already  overripe in some counties, said Roy Turley,  ",1990

765,569,11,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  My good friend, the gentleman from  Minnesota  [Mr. PENNY]  likes  to de scribe  this amendment as providing  earnest money  toward  the  budget  summit. I would like to put the em phasis on ""earnest."" We in Congress,  indeed, must get serious about the def icit. We are not serious when we use  gimmicks  to make  the deficit  seem  smaller, and we are not serious when  we move ahead in adopting spending  bills without  authorization  behind  them. We are not serious when we all  admit that the deficit must come down  by at least $50 billion this year, and  yet we keep increasing spending.  How much does this bill raise? Well,  let Members take a close look at some  of those numbers. In the Commerce  Department, the only authorized pro gram that would have reduced spend ing in this bill is the Census Bureau.  That  is not because  the committee  really tried to save any money, it is be cause the Census is over, and there is  nothing to spend the money on, 1991.  All the other authorized programs in  Commerce  increased,  some by more  than 20 percent. Surely we can do  better at saving money here. In the ju diciary,  the only savings  that  I can  identify is a $1.4 million reduction in  judicial retirement fund. All other pro grams increased, and the total increase  is 15.8 percent. We can do better. The  Department of Justice has a 40.9-per cent increase. I fully endorse providing  the Justice Department with the re sources needed to do its work, particu larly with the S&L which is one of the  reasons that the gentleman from Min nesota exempted that department or  that category. But can we really justi fy that large an increase when we are  facing a deficit crisis?  When we do these kinds of things,  how  can we  expect  the American  people to take Congress seriously in its  efforts to reduce the deficit. Surely we  can reduce the spending in this bill by  2 percent. It is, as my friend the gen tleman from Minnesota says, a modest  but earnest amount. It is a figure that  will say to our constituents and to all  persons and to the budget summiteers  that we are, indeed, serious about re ducing the deficit. I do not want to see  taxes raised. A 2-percent reduction ex empting S&L is the best that we can  do, and the least that we can do.  ",1990
766,569,11,Mr. ROGERS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the amendment.  I hope not to take the full time, but  let me say  this.  I will be voting for  some of these 2-percent cuts, on some  of the bills where it is over last year's  amount, or where it is over the Presi dent's request. Neither one of  those  apply to this bill.  This subcommittee has already cut  enough from this bill to where we cut  the President's request. We are below  what the President requested. We are  below what last year's spending level  was. We are below the Congressional  Budget Office numbers, the CBO base line. We are below all of those, even on  the amounts that are appropriated in  the bill.  Now, Members are going to get their  chance later this year to make a great  big killing  in all  the bills when  the  Senate conference comes back with a  big ""whack"" and Members will have a  lot of funds if they like cuts later this  year. But please do not cut the work  of a  subcommittee who has already  done the cutting. Frankly, cutting on  things  that I would not  like  to cut  anyway-the Justice Department, the  war on drugs, and the savings and loan  prosecutions, and the Commerce De partment, that tries to sell American  goods overseas. Please do not cut this  bill. There will be plenty of opportuni ties later on.  Now, as the chairman has indicated,  to the extent that the Marshal Service  is  involved  in  the savings and  loan  prosecution effort, we are cutting the  savings and  loan prosecutions here.  Make no mistake about it, if Members  want  to go back home and defend  themselves on it, go ahead and cut this  amount of money from  the prosecu tion of savings and loan criminals. No  2,  if Members want to go home and  def end themselves on cutting moneys  from  the  drug war,  vote  for  this  amendment, because that is precisely  what Members are doing. Members are  cutting $8 million  from where  the  money needs to go, and that is to the  local  communities,  to  your  police  force,  and  to your  sheriff's depart ments. These State and  local drug  grants will  cut  $8 million  by  this  amendment. So Members are cutting  the drug war. Members are cutting  international trade promotion because  the  International Trade Administra tion,  carrying America's  trade war  overseas, will be cut by  this amend ment. Members will be cutting weath er service, cutting the U.S.  Informa tion Agency, sending America's mes sage of freedom around the world.  We will have a chance to vote for  cuts later on. Please do not cut the  programs that mean so much to Mem bers and their constituents in America  at this moment.  D 1420  ",1990
767,569,11,Mr.  THOMAS  of Wyoming.," Mr.  Chairman, I move to strike the requi site number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of the amendment.  I will speak very briefly, and I do not  rise to talk about the details but only  to suggest, as do other Members, that  I go home every weekend and I talk to  people about spending, and they say  that we need to be responsible, they  say we need to slow down our spend ing, and they say we need to cut our  spending.  We find ourselves here surrounded  by agencies that, of course, never have  enough money and never will. But our  job  is  that of selecting alternatives.  There is not one of us in our families  or in our businesses who cannot adjust  to a 2-percent cut.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  commend  this  amendment  to my colleagues, and I  support it strongly.  ",1990
768,569,11,Mr. BALLENGER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today  in strong support of  the amendment of my  good friends and colleagues, Mr. UPTON and  ",1990
769,569,11,Mr. PENNY.," The amendment would make a 2  percent across-the-board cut in the discretion ary accounts  in  the Commerce-State-Justice  appropriations bill (H.R. 5021 ).  With more  than  a  $160  billion  Federal  budget deficit for this fiscal year, we  in Con gress  should  relish  the opportunity  to  trim  these  spending bills  in a  fair and prudent  manner. The 2-percent cut would achieve sav ings of approximately $200 million. While this  may seem  like peanuts compared  to the bil lions of dollars appropriated every year,  it  is  one step in the right direction.  Remember  that we have  to be held ac countable for our actions. And quite frankly,  I  do not want to be left carrying the water for all  the spendaholics who refuse to face the cold  hard facts that the House overspends. Every  appropriation bill can stand this modest cut.  It's time to put up or shut up.  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Penny Upton amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment offered by the gentle man from Minnesota [Mr. PENNY].  ",1990
770,582,11,Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska.," Mr. Chair man, the amendment in the nature of  a substitute that I am now offering to  S. 280 fixes a bad, irresponsible bill.  My amendment conforms with cur rent law by providing for a usual and  customary study, pursuant to sections  5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act,  of the entire length of the Niobrara  River  included in the 1982 National  Park Service ""Nationwide Rivers In ventory.""  My amendment  is environmentally  sound and  logical.  It proposes  that  253-miles,  not  just  an  arbitrarily  named 76 miles, of the unique Nio brara River be studied for designation  in the Wild and Scenic Rivers System.  In  addition,  because  5<a>  studies  have most often failed to answer all of  the questions surrounding a potential  designation, especially in cases like the  Niobrara where a majority of private  land is involved, my amendment also  provides for a  thorough management  plan to be formulated for the area.  The  administration  supports  this  amendment. Interior Secretary Lujan  and OMB Director Darman will rec ommend that S. 280 be vetoed should  this amendment fail today.  This  is  not  just  another  simple  scenic river designation. Because the  land along the Niobrara River is ex tensively privately owned, it is a prece dent-setting piece of legislation.  My amendment is supported by an  overwhelming majority of Nebraskans.  In a statewide poll conducted June 1112, 1990, 63 percent favored studying  the river, as I propose, before designa tion. Only 27 percent favored instant  designation  and  immediate Federal  intervention.  As I do, the majority of Nebraskans  want to be sure that the Department  of  the  Interior,  the  agency  to  be  charged with managing the river as a  national component, has the informa tion it needs to effectively and correct ly  administer  the  river or portions  thereof as components of the national  system.  My amendment gives  the National  Park Service 30 months to complete a  comprehensive,  formal,  and  useful  study of  the Niobrara River. The  agency said in testimony and consulta tions that it recommends, and I quote  from a April 5, 1989, Senate hearing,  ""two to three complete fiscal years"" to  conduct the normal suitability study  set forth in the law.  If my study amendment is enacted, I  fully expect that 30 months from now,  we will be designating parts of  the  Niobrara River as components of the  Wild and Scenic Rivers System.  But my amendment provides mecha nisms for making sure the concerns of  all will have been appropriately ad dressed in a carefully developed man agement plan.  The  study  provided  for  in my  amendment also may determine that  portions of the river are so ecologically  fragile that they should be designated  as wild, a designation that would in volve more restrictions and protections  than a scenic label.  A study may determine  that some  segments should be designated as rec reational,  a  designation  that would  entail less restrictions and protections  than a scenic label.  The bottom line is that a study must  be performed to determine which seg ments of the river need formal protec tion, how best  to protect  those seg ments, and who-local, State, or Fed eral Government-should be responsi ble  for managing and  implementing  the protection plan.  In my  statement  during  general  debate, I offered the hard, indisputa ble evidence-the Niobrara River has  not  been  studied  for  the  purpose  before us today. But let me repeat to  drive this important point.  Quoting from a Department of the  Interior  letter written  earlier  this  month: ""Out of the 108 rivers desig nated by Congress since 1968 as com ponents  of  the National Wild  and  Scenic Rivers System, none has been  designated without  some  form  of  study by the National Park Service,  Forest Service, Bureau of Land Man agement, or other agency. The Nio brara has had no formal study whatso ever.""  I want to point out for my colleagues  that this is not the identical amend ment offered and defeated  in both  subcommittee  and  full  committee  markups. I have made minor, but sig nificant improvements.  Most significantly, I have changed  the amendment  to meet  the charge  that  it  contained  a  loophole  that  would allow for the Norden Dam to be  constructed along the Niobrara River  in the future.  The Norden Dam  is  a  long-dead  project being used by proponents of  immediate designation  as  a  smoke screen to detract from the issue and  provide a tenuous and irrelevant argu ment to further their position.  Although this is not a debate about  the Norden Dam, I have made every  effort to address the concerns of my  colleagues.  I urge support for my amendment.  Everyone agrees the river should be  protected;  that  is  not  the  debate  before us today.  This is a crucial procedural debate  about  fairness and conforming with  current  law, which my  amendment  does.  The Niobrara River  is not  threat ened by any immediate or near-term  development or adverse uses. We have  time to follow the law we enacted and  do this the right way.  Let me close by summarizing why  you should vote yes on this amend ment:  Vote ""yes"" for expert study before  ""instant"" Federal designation.  Vote ""yes"" for studying 253 miles of  a beautiful river-not just blindly des ignating 76 miles.  Vote ""yes""  to do  the  job we were  sent here  to do-represent our con stituents-and  to  save your district  from the political steamroller driving  this bill.  Vote  ""yes"" on  ment.  the Smith amend D 1600  ",1990
771,582,11,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the Smith amendment.  This amendment is designed to once  again postpone and def eat the protec tion and designation of the Niobrara  River. Not  content with  trying  to  eliminate the 76-mile scenic designa tion of  the Niobrara, Mrs. SMITH'S  amendment would strike all the provi sions of the bill, including those unre lated to the 76-mile designation.  Opponents of designating the Nio brara Scenic River have taken to call ing this ""instant"" designation. Well, 25  years is anything but instant and that  is exactly how far back proposals to  designate the Niobrara River go. The  gentlewoman would have us believe  designation just came up and is now  suddenly being thrust upon the area.  The fact of the matter is Federal and  State agencies have  inventoried and  studied this river for many years and  reported on its outstanding resource  values.  ",1990

773,621,11,Mr.  ROE.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, today I  rise in strong  support of S. 2124, the National Space  Council Authorization Act  of  1990.  The bill provides authorizations in the  amount of $1.2 million to pay the sala ries of  the National Space Council  staff and other necessary expenses.  The National Space Council was es tablished in the NASA Authorization  Act of fiscal year 1989 in order to ad dress  issues of national space policy  and  to  resolve  interagency disputes.  Since  its  inception,  the Council has  successfully dealt with national space  policy issues such as Landsat funding.  And the Council continues to work to  resolve the Nation's mission to inhabit  the Moon and to explore Mars. The  Science, Space, and Technology Com mittee hopes that the National Space  Council will continue its best efforts in  this area, and also that it will apply  the Council's resources  to better re solve  interagency disputes. Members  of the National Space Council include  the Administrator of NASA and the  Secretaries of State, Defense, Com merce, Transportation, and Treasury  as well as the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget, the Chief of  Staff to the President, the Assistant to  the President  for National Security  Affairs, the Director of Central Intelli gence and the Assistant to the Presi dent for Science and Technology.  S. 2124 also requests the Council to  conduct  a  review of United States  launch policy,  including the Nation's  expendable launch vehicle and satel lite industries. It is expected that the  result of  the  review will be a  clear  path  that  ensures  the Nation will  maintain its leadership role in space.  Mr. Speaker, S. 2124 is an important  statement of support by this Congress.  I urge my colleagues  to  join me  in  voting for this bill.  D 1820  Mr. Speaker, I would like to make  one  clarifying  point.  I  particularly  want to thank the distinguished chair man of the Committee on Post Office  and Civil Service, the gentleman from  Michigan  [Mr. FORD], who was very  helpful in getting this bill to the floor.  I want to express my deep apprecia tion to him.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",1990
774,621,11,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S.  2124, the National Space Council Au thorization Act of 1990. This bill  is  noncontroversial, yet urgently needed.  It should be supported by both sides  of the aisle.  The National Space Council was res urrected  in  the NASA Authorization  Act of 1989 at  the  initiative of  the  House Science, Space, and Technology  Committee. Its purpose is to serve as a  principal adviser to the President on  space-related issues and to coordinate  the space-related activities across the  various Government departments and  agencies.  The Senate passed S. 2124 by unani mous consent in February. S. 2124  is  virtually identical to section 14 of H.R.  1759, the House-passed fiscal year 1990  NASA authorization bill. Unfortunate ly,  because  the House  and Senate  failed to enact a NASA authorization  bill  for  fiscal year 1990,  the Space  Council has been operating so far this  year without any budget authority.  This situation has made  the Space  Council's existence very tenuous and  has complicated  its hiring and busi ness activities.  Today we have the opportunity to  pass this stand-alone National Space  Council  authorization  bill,  and  in  doing so, enhance the stature and effi ciency of the Council. I urge my col leagues to support S. 2124.  ",1990
775,621,11,Mr. ROE.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  myself an additional 2 minutes.  Mr. Speaker,  I want  to expand a  little bit on the comment I made about  the chairman of  the Committee on  Post Office and Civil Service, the gen tleman from Michigan [Mr. FoRDl.  This  particular  bill  that we  are  working on tonight is an extremely im portant  bill,  because  in  effect  the  Space Council would not even operate  and  it could not operate effectively  without the added help that is needed  here.  The chairman of the Committee on  Post Office and Civil Service  is also  working on a major piece of legislation  that will start to bring into clear focus  the absolutely essential need of the  House and Senate, and  the Govern ment for  that matter,  to have ade quate resources to engage people who  are technically trained and technically  capable of carrying out the work that  is needed here in the House.  I think sometimes that being penny wise and pound foolish  is a big mis take. I hope that when we get to that  bill and that bill  is debated, we will  have the chance, at least from the per spective of the Committee on Science,  Space, and Technology, to bring ihto  yield  sharp focus  the need for proper re sources to engage the qualified people  who are needed to fill the important  roles we have in the various space and  technology areas.

781,634,11,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from Oklahoma CMr. McCuR DY] is recognized for 60 minutes.  Mr. McCURDY. Mr. Speaker, today  another hero in the worldwide strug gle for liberty has come before us in  Congress. We rejoice that Nelson Man dela chose this platform now that he  is free at last.  Nelson Mandela, Vaclav Havel, Lech  Walesa, and other leaders seeking to  throw off oppression in their countries  come to Congress for a reason. It's not  just a matter of protocol or publicity.  They come here because in their coun tries, the U.S. Congress means some thing. Just as Nelson Mandela  is a  symbol of the fight against apartheid  and oppression, the U.S. Congress still  stands as a symbol of the democratic  freedoms to which all nations aspire.  Their visits should remind America's  leaders of our awesome responsibility  to show  the world what democracy  stands for. America cannot afford to  let down millions of people around the  world at the very moment they are  turning  to embrace our values. And  yet, I fear that from the Halls of Con gress to the Oval Office, we are letting  the world down.  We  let  the world down when we  spend days debating whether  to  re write our constitution to keep a few lu natics  from  burning  the American  flag-all because some Republicans in  this body saw some partisan political  advantage in questioning our patriot ism.  We let the world down when we fail  to provide  the  economic  leadership  that has always been America's role as  the world's greatest economic power.  And we let the world down when we  duck hard choices on the budget that  are  essential  to  future  economic  growth not only here, but around the  globe.  Later  this week, most of us will  return to our districts for the Fourth  of July recess. I'm not worried about  explaining to the people in my district  why I voted  to preserve  the Bill of  Rights.  I am more concerned about  trying to explain why Washington is  not tackling the serious issues.  Why haven't we been able to reverse  the growing Federal debt? Why can't  we  answer  the  critical health care  needs of  this country? How do we  ensure  international  competitiveness  in  a  global  economy? Why  is  the  American standard of living on the de cline? If education truly is a high pri ority, where are our reforms?  These are the questions on the lips  of my Oklahoma constituents. These  questions and one more. They are also  asking. ""What are you people doing  out there in Washington?"" The gener al public  is not apathetic. They are  wondrous. They can't figure out what  we are doing because Washington is  afraid to tell them.  Americans don't distrust Washing ton because  they have  lost faith  in  their leaders. They distrust Washing ton because they sense that their lead ers have lost faith in them.  Mr. Speaker,  I  am sure  that  the  great majority of us did not come to  Congress to hide from the American  people. In recent weeks, a  few of us  have met  informally  to  talk  about  what we  sense has gone wrong  in  Washington, and what we can do to  right it.  For  the past several years, a  few  vocal members of the other party, led  by  the minority whip,  have  been  coming to this floor to offer a distort ed view of America and of our party.  We've had enough. Today, we're going  to set the record straight.  Let me tell you about this band of  Republican opportunists who would  rather follow Mr. GINGRICH of Georgia  than pursue  the  truth. They have  called  themselves  the Conservative  Opportunity Society, but  they don't  talk about the opportunities that are  lost to Americans every day because of  the borrow-and-spend budget policies  of  their  conservative  government,  which ran a $42.5 billion deficit in the  month of May alone.  America is not saving, investing, or  producing. Instead, we spend, borrow,  and consume.  The right talks about family values,  but they don't talk about their party's  HUD  scandals, which we uncovered  and which have  robbed millions of  American families of the most basic  element of the American dream, the  chance to own a home.  They talk about the work ethic, but  they don't talk about the regressive  tax on work they've used to cover up  their  enormous  deficits. They  say  Democrats will raise your taxes, when  in  fact  Republicans  have  already  raised your Social Security payroll tax  seven times in the last 10 years.  They talk about law and order, but  they don't talk about the nationwide  explosion of drugs and violent crime  that  happened  entirely  on  their  watch-and they don't do anything to  prosecute the corrupt savings and loan  executives who  stole money  from  hard-working family depositors.  They talk about protecting the sym bols of freedom, but they don't talk  about  protecting  the  freedoms  for  which  those symbols stand-freedom  of speech, freedom of choice, freedom  from a government that tells you what  you can and cannot say or do.  ",1990
782,660,11,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Speaker,  this country re cently  lost one of  its great civic  leaders-a  pillar of the civic community of the cities of  Austin and Dallas and the State of Texas, and  an outstanding spokesman  for our disabled  veterans-William O'Brien Cooper, known  to  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  those close to him as ""Bill."" He died recently  in Paris, France, at the age of 81.  In recent years, Bill Cooper lived in my dis trict in Austin, TX, and he was just as active  and effective a  leader as he was  in earlier  years with the Dallas and Texas Junior Cham bers of Commerce, when he served as presi dent of each group. He  loved to take part in  youth projects,  like  the establishment of a  summer camp for predelinquent boys.  Bill's service to his Nation began, like many  young men of his day,  immediately after the  attack on Pearl Harbor. Bill enlisted  in  the  Tank Corps of the U.S. Army, serving with the  12th Armored Division from 1942 to 1946. His  service earned him the Bronze Star, France's  Medal of Liberation, and numerous World War  II campaign medals.  When the war ended, Bill became interest ed in the needs and problems of war veterans  and their dependants. He provided great as sistance to World War II vets through his work  with  the Federal Government  in  veterans,  housing, and reemployment programs, serving  in the Southwestern States of Arkansas, Lou isiana, Oklahoma,  and Texas  for 4  years  before entering private business.  Through his business career, Bill continued  to work on behalf of veterans, especially the  disabled. He held positions of  leadership at  the local, State, and national levels in the Dis abled American Veterans, becoming  its na tional commander in 1960. Under his leader ship, new emphasis was placed on broaden ing the range of services available to disabled  veterans and  their dependants. Through  the  efforts of Bill's administration, the DAV veter ans service grew to be one of the most out standing programs of its kind in the Nation.  The past national adjutant general of  the  Disabled  American  Veterans,  Denvel  D.  Adams, credited Bill Cooper not only with the  organization's success but  it's very survival.  ""Bill was one of the generals that led the DAV  out of  the  throws of bankruptcy"" when  the  DAV was on the brink of financial ruin, Adams  said. Upon  learning of Bill's death, past na tional commander Billy Kirby described Bill as  ""a man who was everything the DAV stands  for, a true gentleman. He never once sought  to get anything out of  the DAV. He only  sought  to give what he could give, how he  could best serve his fellow man.""  Following his tenure as national commander  of the DAV, Bill was chosen by the U.S. De partment of State to become the Director of  the Agency  for  International Development  to  the Sudan, a position he held until 1967. For  his efforts with the Agency, Bill was honored  by the Sudanese on numerous occasions for  his personal contributions to the economic de velopment of the country.  Bill continued his lifelong work on behalf of  veterans and  earned worldwide  recognition  while  serving as Secretary General of  the  World  Veterans  Federation  from  1967  to  1976. The Federation includes associations of  war veterans,  former  resistance  fighters, de portees, prisoners of war, and war victims  from 49 countries on 5 continents. Under Bill's  leadership, the Federation worked to promote  the interests of all people disabled by war.  For his important contributions as WVF Sec retary General, Bill was  inducted  into  the  Order of Orange-Nassau, one of the highest  June 26, 1990  honors  the country of  the Netherlands can  bestow. During Bill's induction into the Order,  the Dutch Secretary of State for Foreign Af fairs described Bill as ""a man who not only  advocated but translated into his daily life the  principles of freedom, peace, and human dig nity.""  Mr. Speaker, from a personal standpoint, I  have lost a dear and  loyal friend. Bill Cooper  and I were not only good friends when it came  to veterans matters, we were close personal  friends.  For  the  last 15 years or so, Bill  lived  in  Austin and was active in civic and political af fairs. He never let up on his activities, carrying  on with the vigor of a much younger man and  remaining extraordinarily  loyal  to his  friends  and his causes. Somehow you knew that Bill  Cooper would always be  there  to do some thing  for you or  for a good cause-not just  waiting  to be asked, but  taking  the  initiative  ahead of time.  Mr. Speaker, Bill Cooper's death is an ines timable  loss  to veterans  in  this country and  around the world. I have visited his family: his  wife Lucille of Austin, TX, his son, Don, and  daughter-in-law, Eva, of Alexandria, VA, and  two grandchildren, Paul and Stephanie.  I feel  a very personal  loss with the passing of this  remarkable, warm and kind man.  BUSH  ADMINISTRATION  FUSES  TO  ENFORCE  APARTHEID SANCTIONS  RE ANTIHON.

Today, Mr. Mandela  addressed a  joint session of  the U.S. Con gress.  Yet it is ironic that-almost 4 years after the  enactment over President Reagan's veto of  the  Comprehensive  Anti-Apartheid  Act  of  1986-the  Bush  admninistration,  like  the  Reagan administration before it, continues to  refuse  to enforce  the sanctions  required by  law against  the  racist apartheid Government  of South Africa.  A year ago,  I became aware of the fact-in  spite of explicit language in the Anti-Apartheid  Act  that ""no iron or steel produced, or iron  ore extracted,  in South Africa may be import ed  into the United States"" -that the Reagan  and Bush administrations had consciously per mitted 1.8 billion pounds of  iron and steel  products  to  enter  the United States  from  South Africa in just the first 2 full years of the  law.  Not just the failure, but the conscious refus al of the Reagan and Bush administrations to  enforce the sanctions with regard to iron and  steel contained in the Anti-Apartheid Act was  exposed  in an excellent series of articles by  Kenneth F. Bunting of the Fort Worth Star Telegram.  Some of  the South African steel  that  the  Bush administration says  is not covered by  Congress' absolute ban-you see  the Presi",1990
784,673,11,Mr. LEWIS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  in the last few weeks I have had the  displeasure of hearing some of my col leagues bickering about who is  to be  blamed for the savings and loan mess.  Republicans blame the Democrat ma jority, and the Democrats try to blame  a President who was not even in office.  Well, I have an idea that may sound  strange to some of us.  I believe the  American people do not want to see us  quarrel like children. They want to see  us clean up this mess and punish those  who were responsible.  We must remember that, for every  moment spent blaming each other, a  moment is lost that could be spent reg ulating and overseeing the bailout.  Mr. Speaker,  it would be  almost  funny if it were not so serious. Con gressmen who should be overseeing  this bailout are instead spending their  time positioning themselves to deflect  the blame for the lack of supervision.  What a  backward way of making  policy. It seems to me that, if Mem bers did their job, they would not have  to position themselves to deflect the  blame that comes their way when the  job is not done right.  Mr. Speaker,  the American people  are realizing the scope of this scandal.  It is  time for  the Congress  to stop  their name  calling and get  serious  about cleaning up this mess.

787,673,11,Mrs. MORELLA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to reiterate my support for the Family  and Medical Leave Act, a bill which  will provide the vast majority of Amer ican workers with  the  job  security  they have thus far been lacking.  STOP THE BICKERING AND GET  ON WITH CLEANING UP THE  S&L MESS  <Mr. LEWIS of Florida asked and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  39-059 0-91-22 (Pt. 11)  The United States and South Africa  are the only industrialized nations in  the world that do not off er something  like the Family and Medical Leave Act  to their citizens. In other words, we  are  the only Nation on Earth  that  makes its people choose between their  families and  their  jobs. During  the  past 25 years, the American work force  has  changed dramatically,  and  this  has wrought an immense burden on  our families. Two-thirds of mothers of  children under the age of three work  outside the home-in a nation where  affordable, dependable child care  is  extremely difficult to find. In the tra dition of legislation like the minimum  wage, Social Security, and health and  safety  regulations,  the Family  and  Medical Leave Act addresses an urgent  social need-the need for our society  to  recognize  that  its  citizens  are  people, as well as workers.  In addition, the bill strikes a balance  between  the needs of business and  those of working  families.  It allows  workers to take 12 weeks off-without  pay-for family or medical emergen cies, yet  it permits employers  to re place workers who have not returned  after  those  12 weeks.  In  a  nation  which prides itself in its family values,  surely we can permit our citizens to be  with their loved ones during times of  illness, with  their  children  in  the  formative months after childbirth.  I sincerely hope that the President  will sign this family bill into law.

788,673,11,Mr. BUSTAMANTE.," Mr. Speaker, I  urge  you  to  support  the Moakley Murtha language as contained in the  foreign aid appropriations bill, H.R.  4636. If enacted, we will significantly  alter United States policy in El Salva dor, a nation ravaged by a bloody, civil  war for the past 10 years.  This bill will provide an incentive for  peace,  a  strong  inducement  for  the  FMLN and  the Salvadoran Govern ment to finally negotiate a settlement  to the war. Reducing military assist ance by 50 percent will send a clear  message  to both sides that the U.S.  Goverilment favors negotiations for a  permanent settlement to the war.  Despite past high levels of funding  and increased military education and  training by the United States Govern ment, human rights abuses by the Sal vadoran  military  have  not  been  curbed. The Moakley-Murtha provi sion will compel  the military  to  re spect basic human rights.

791,699,11,Mr. YA TRON.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  in sup port of H.R. 5114, the Foreign Assistance Ap propriations Act for 1991 and to comment on  a specific provision  in  the bill  regarding  the  United States security assistance program for  Greece and Turkey.  Consistent with  congressional  efforts  to  maintain a balanced United States  foreign  policy toward these two NATO allies, the Ap propriations Committee in its wisdom adjusted  the assistance levels to Turkey and Greece to  reflect  the 10  to 7 ratio. This ratio had  the  effect of  reducing  the administration's  fiscal  year  1991  military  assistance  request  to  Turkey  from $545 million  to $430 million.  I  strongly support  the committee's recommen dation to reduce aid to Turkey and to maintain  the 1 O to 7 ratio. Both initiatives implicitly link  United States policy toward Turkey  to Anka ra's unjust occupation of Cyprus.  Mr. Chairman,  this past spring  the United  Nations-sponsored  talks  on  Cyprus  were  broken off as a result of the intransigent posi tions  advocated  by Turkish Cypriot  leader  Rauf Denktash and his supporters in the Turk ish Government. Observers of Turkish policy  have suggested that the failure of these talks  would break the spirit of those countries which  have consistently called for a peaceful settle ment of the Cyprus dispute and the withdrawal  of Turkish forces from this eastern Mediterra nean nation. Nothing could be further from the  truth.  Mr. Chairman,  the Appropriations Commit tee's recommendation to reduce aid to Turkey  sends a clear signal to Ankara that Congress  remains  committed  to a settlement of  the  Cyprus dispute. A settlement  to  this dispute  would  be  good  for  both  communities  on  Cyprus,  and would  serve  the  interests  of  Turkey, Greece, and the United States.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5114  and  its provision which  reduces security as sistance to Turkey.  ",1990
792,699,11,Mr.  RICHARDSON.,"  Mr.  Chairman,  last  month I traveled to Chile for a Conference on  Democratic Institutions which included several  members of the Chilean  legislature. While  in  Chile,  I was most  impressed at the  tremen dous strides that nation is making toward re storing  its great democratic tradition after 16  years of dictatorial rule.  President Patricio Aylwin has taken positive  steps to heal  the wounds of his country. He  recently appointed  the Commission on Truth  and  Reconciliation  which ""will  investigate  human  rights violations by both  the military  and  leftwing extremists. By  investigating past  abuses the Commission will boost public con fidence  in  the Government and  restore  re spect for human rights.  Furthermore, President Aylwin has pledged  cooperation to bring to a resolution the Lete lier-Moffitt assassination case.  Despite Chile's  democratic  tradition  and  strong  popular  support,  President Aylwin's  government faces several challenges in rees tablishing a working democracy.  It  is  the  re sponsibility of the United States to assist, as  much as possible, these efforts.  H.R. 5114,  the Appropriations  for Foreign  Operations,  includes  important  provisions  which help Chile meet the challenges of rees tablishing its democracy.  The bill  recommends  that AID undertake  housing guarantee programs in the amount of  $20 million for Chile.  Furthermore,  the bill  lifts the restriction  for  aid to Chile for those programs which promote  an independent judiciary and build democratic  institutions and recommends that as much as  $5 million be used for these purposes.  I would  like  to commend  the chairman of  the Subcommittee on Appropriations  for For eign Operations-Mr. OBEY-and the subcom mittee for recognizing both Chile's significant  steps toward democracy and the need to pro vide United States assistance to that nation.  It  is my hope that a new period  in United  States-Chilean  relations  is dawning and  that  we will see our ties to Chile continue to grow  and strengthen in the years to come.  [From the Christian Science Monitor, Apr.  11, 1990]  CHILE REACHES FOR DEMOCRACY  <By Peter Hakim and Peter D. Belll  The  inauguration  of President Patricio  Aylwin  in Chile  last month was cause for  celebrationfirst and foremost for the Chil eans themselves, who after 16 years of mili tary rule had finally regained their freedom  and their country.  Chile's  return  to democracy  also holds  special significance  for  the  rest of Latin  America.  Prior  to  the  1973  coup  that  brought General Pinochet to power, Chile  took pride in the most enduring tradition of  democratic rule in all of Latin America.  After the coup, Pinochet came to symbol ize  the nightmare of military rule  in  the  region. The  recent  democratic  trend  in  Latin America, no matter how widespread,  remained truncated so long as Chile was a  dictatorship.  For the Alywin government the time for  celebration  is  over. Now  it  is  time  to  govern-and that means  in Chile what  it  has meant  in virtually every other Latin  American country where the basis for au thority has shifted from bullets to ballots.  The newly elected authorities must  re build the institutions of representative gov ernment; overcome the legacy of fear, mis trust, and bitterness that continues to divide  Chileans; and give more attention  to  the  needs of the people who have suffered most  over the last 16 years-the poor.  President Aylwin starts off with one enor mous advantage over his counterparts in the  region's other countries. Only in Chile has  the military turned over a well-functioning  economy  to  its civilian successors.  Indeed,  the Chilean economy is the healthiest in all  of Latin America: The national budget  is  balanced; unemployment is low; internation al accounts are in order; exports are boom ing;  and  the  country  has  enjoyed  five  straight years of strong economic growth.  But the recent strength of  the Chilean  economy should not obscure continuing vul nerabilities. Chile is still a poor country. Per  capita income is only 10 percent of that in  the United States; its external debt is one of  the highest per capita in the entire world,  and enormous payments come due  in  the  next two years. Also, Chile still depends on  copper for nearly one-half of its foreign ex change earnings. Living standards for most  Chileans have not  improved much  since  1970and may have actually declined for  the 30-40 percent of the country's poorest  citizens.  The immediate task of Chile's economic  managers  is  to cool down an overheated  economy  to avoid fueling  inflation, which  rose to an annual rate of 30 percent in late  1989. At the same time, they must begin to  meet some of the country's long-bottled-up  demands  for  improved  education, health  care, and housing-and address  the  legiti mate  claims of Chile's  labor movement,  which  the military had  legislated and  in timidated  into passivity. All  this will be a  difficult balancing act.  It will  be  even more difficult  for  the  Aylwin government to find the right formu la for coming to terms with 16 years of sys tematic human  rights  abuse. Year after  year, Chile's military rulers were cited  in  the l marts of the U.S. State Department,  United Nations, Organization of American  States, and private human rights organiza tions  for  torture, arbitary arrests, ""disap pearances,"" and unpunished political kill ings.  Most Chileans want these abuses investi gated and the truth revealed; many would  like to see those responsible punished. The  justness of these demands cannot be easily  denied by a democratic government.  Yet Chile's military  forces, which  still  wield much power, are opposed to such in vestigations and dead set against any pun ishment of military officers.

794,712,11,Mr.  ATKINS.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding this  time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I was in Romania last  January shortly after the revolution,  and the one thing that was clear in  Romania-and I would agree with my  colleagues in opposition  to  this-was  that the situation for family planning  and population control was absolutely  horrendous.  The one thing that is done with any  efficiency  in Romania relates  to  the  provision of abortions.  Indeed  today  there are as many abortions being per formed in Romania, a country of 23  million people,  as  there are  in  the  United States, and it is very clear what  the prescription is for that, and that is  the provision of family planning serv ices.  The question is how those services  shall be provided. I went in and approached the U.S. Ambassador when I  was there. The Ambassador told me,  no, we cannot provide family planning  services because we do not want to get  in  the middle of a debate over  the  Mexico City policy.  The United States did nothing after  the  revolution.  I worked  since my  return, contacted  the State Depart ment, wrote a letter to Secretary Eag leburger, and got a letter congratulat ing me for my interest but I also re ceived a letter on April 12 from AID.  The letter from AID cited the assess ments of UNFPA and IPPF, the two  agencies we do not put money in, but  they are the two agencies the adminis tration  and  the State Department  cited as the experts that underscored  the terrible situation in Romania. The  same  letter  indicated  that no  funds  could flow because  the UNFP A and  IPPF were ineligible for funding. And  then the letter from the State Depart ment said that ""Our plan at this time  is  to continue monitoring  the needs  and  the major doner activities and  family planning  in Romania as we  evaluate the efficacy of bilateral sup port.""  AID was unwilling  to do anything  but monitor and monitor, and  they  were monitoring  the  only  agencies  that are operating  in  the field,  the  U.N. Fund  for Population Activities  and  International  Planned  Parent hood.  After the Foreign Affairs Committee  approved $1 million for family plan ning assistance in Romania, they sud denly started moving and said  they  have other agencies, agencies that, I  might add, have no presence in Roma nia presently,  that do not have any  connections with  the  indigenous Ro manian family planning services and  two  of  those  organizations  support  providing  the  funding  through  the  U.N. Fund  for Population Activities  and the International Planned Parent hood.  So the issue  is not a provision for  family planning services; the issue is,  should  we  provide  them  through  people who have an  infrastructure,  who have  the connections and have  the ability to provide the services in  Romania, or should we provide them  through organizations that will not be  able  to provide  the services,  that do  not have any of the support mecha nisms and that never operated in Ro mania before?  Mr. SMITH  of New  Jersey. Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds  just to respond very briefly.  Mr. Chairman,  the gentleman's in formation is incorrect. We have been  advised by AID  that an assessment  team could be  in Romania within 2  weeks, and that these four organiza tions have been approached and could  provide  the necessary  contraceptive  family planning services that the Ro manian people would want.  Perhaps the gentleman was unaware  that these organizations were  there,  but we do have information, and ac cording to Dr. Roskens, these organi zations stand ready, willing, and able  to provide those necessary services for  Romania.  0 1350  Mr.  SMITH  of New  Jersey.

We  just  heard earlier this week, medical sup plies. There is vast corruption. There  is vast inefficiencies in this system.  Mr. Chairman,  they cannot do  it.  That is why two of the agencies have  said that their preference is, and this  is from CEDPA and from A VSC, that  they support providing  the  funding  immediately through the UNFPA and  the IPPF.

Mr. Chairman, to pick up on what  was said, I,  too, was  in Romania re cently, and I can  tell my colleagues  that the situation there is absolutely  horrendous. There are over 3,000 abor tions  being  performed  every  single  day. My colleagues can try to stop that  immediately, not 1 month or 6 months  from now, and any of the new sets of  agencies could go in there. They have  nobody in Romania, not one person in  Romania, on the ground. They have  no one who speaks Romanian, I sus pect. They are going to have to start  from scratch. Only today did AID give  the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr.  SMITH] a  letter saying they are now  prepared to do this. It is going to be  months.  If my colleagues want to stop abor tion, go  at  least  for now with  the  people who are prepared  to provide  the  family planning alternatives  to  abortion. If my colleagues are sincere,  and I know they are, about stopping  abortion,  let us get  it stopped now.  The way to go now is to go with those  people in Romania who have the orga nizational ability and who our own  AID people said are the only effective  ones now operating. We can disagree  on whether or not in the long term we  want  to use  those agencies, but for  now,  if my colleagues want  to stop  3,000 every day abortions, go with the  agencies that are there now.

Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague  for her  eloquent  remarks,  strongly  support her  amendment,  and  com mend her for her actions.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the  Oakar amendment. The  violence  that  has  gripped Lebanon  for  the past 16 years has  claimed thousands of lives. Most of these cas ualties and  fatalities are  innocent civilians.  I  believe that the United States must not turn  its back on  the people of Lebanon who so  desperately need our help.  There is an enormous need for emergency  and rehabilitative medical care in Lebanon. In  addition,  the  fighting has devastated all as pects of  that country's economic  infrastruc ture.  It will  take years  to rebuild Lebanon  to  the prosperous nation it once was.  This amendment would earmark $7.5 million  in humanitarian aid  to Lebanon. This aid will  go to private voluntary organizations that can  best deliver  the assistance. These organiza tions include the YMCA, Catholic Relief Serv ices, Save the Children, and the World Reha bilitation Fund. This money will also go to the  American University Hospital in Beirut.  Until peace  can  finally be achieved, we  must, at the very least, try to alleviate the suf fering of the Lebanese people. Mr. Speaker,  let us extend a helping hand  to  a  fellow   democratic nation in its hour of darkness. Let  us show,  in  this House,  the  traditional com passion of the American people in the face of  human suffering. And  let us demonstrate our  commitment to peace in  that deeply troubled  country.  I urge my colleagues to vote for the  Oakar amendment.  the gentle ",1990

I certainly rise  in strong sup port.  The conflict that has wrecked the  country of Lebanon for 15 years now  has affected not only Americans of  Lebanese descent, as the gentlewoman  from Ohio  and myself,  but many  Americans. We know that the people  of Lebanon do want peace. They are  not the ones responsible for the taking  of American hostages or any hostages  in that country. Indeed the people of  Lebanon are being held hostage them selves to outside powers that only fuel  the flames of fighting in that country  for their own selfish purposes.  The gentlewoman stressed very well  that this $7.5 million goes to private  to any  voluntary organizations, not  militia leaders.  The  gentlewoman mentioned  the  trip to Lebanon that she took late last  year, which I had the honor to  join  her. At that time we were able to see  that the devastation has not only af fected the western Moslem section of  Beirut but now is affecting the eastern  Christian sectors of Beirut as well.  The devastation  in  the Christian  sector, for example, has been worse in  the last 3 or 4 months than in perhaps  the last 15 years of fighting in that  country.  So this is money desperately needed  by the people of Lebanon, the people  that  love  the American people,  the  people that love our country, want to  be our friends.  This is only a pittance, I believe, of  what we can do  in return for  their  friendship, for our desire to seek peace  in the country,  to see the territorial  sovereignty of Lebanon and the recog nition of all  the boundaries of  the  countries  in  the  region,  to  live  in  peace, free from continued devastation  and human suffering.

Mr. Chairman, it is clear to me that  the  humanitarian  thrust  of  this  amendment is very important for us to  recognize.  A recent study that was put forward  by Dr. Mona Maksoud, of 2,000 young  Lebanese children who have been vic timized, provided some incredible fig ures. Ninety percent of the children in  Lebanon have been exposed  to bom bardment; 68 percent have been dis placed from their homes and schools;  54 percent live in extreme poverty and  deprivation;  50  percent  witnessed  major acts of violence; 26 percent have  lost a member of their family in this  war.  The humanitarian thrust is exactly  what my  friend,  the  gentlewoman  from Ohio is going toward. My constit uent, Dr. Antoine Garabet, is an eye  surgeon working in Lebanon today.

812,725,11,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Chairman, may I  just  inquire  of my  distinguished  friend, the gentleman from Oklahoma,  ",1990
813,738,11,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself 5 minutes.  Mr.  Chairman,  my  amendment,  whch is offered together with the gen tleman  from Michigan  [Mr. BROOM FIELD],  is designed to permit the pro gram of nonlethal assistance  to  the  non-Communist  resistance  forces  whom we have supported for many  years in Cambodia to continue, while  simultaneously prohibiting any assist ance  directly  or  indirectly  to  the  Khmer Rouge.  The amendment would strike a pro vision  in  the  bill  before Members  which would prohibit any and all as sistance, even nonlethal assistance, to  the non-Communist resistance forces  in Cambodia. Mr. Chairman, I  think  we have three main objectives which  we need to consider in Cambodia. The  first  is  to prevent Pol Pot and  the  Khmer  Rouge  from  returning  to  power. The  second  is  to bring  the  fighting  in  that country  to an end.  The third is to make it possible for the  people of Cambodia, at long last,  to  have the opportunity for self-determi nation.  Mr. Chairman, I will submit that the  provision in the bill which completely  prohibits any assistance whatsoever to  the non-Communist resistance forces  would strike a deadly blow against our  efforts to prevent the Khmer Rouge  from returning to power,  to make a  free and fair election possible, and to  bring the fight in Cambodia to an end.  Indeed,  I would suggest  that  if our  amendment  is defeated and the lan guage in the bill is preserved, it would  play  right  into  the  hands  of  the  Khmer Rouge. It would play into the  hands of the Khmer Rouge by greatly  diminishing the prospects for a politi cal settlement of the Cambodian con flict which would bring the fighting to  an end, which would facilitate the in troduction of a  large United Nations  peacekeeping force, and which would  make possible an  internationally su pervised free and fair election.  In a free and fair election, Pol Pot  and the Khmer Rouge would have no  chance whatsoever. The anti-Khmer  Rouge elements in Cambodia will not  need Roger Ailes  to make negative  spots  in order  to def eat the Khmer  Rouge  in  an  election. However,  if  there is no political settlement and the  fighting continues, then Pol Pot and  the Khmer Rouge, who have 40,000  men still under arms and constitute  the most formidable and fanatical of  the various Cambodian factions in the  field, could very easily battle their way  back to power in Phnom Penh over  the next few years.  The reason that the defeat of this  amendment and the adoption of the  language  in  the bill would diminish  the prospects  for  a  political  settle ment, thereby playing into the hands  of Pol Pot, is that it would greatly di minish  the  incentive which Vietnam  has to agree to a political settlement.  We are now closer to achieving a polit ical settlement of the Cambodian con flict than at any time in the last 15  years. The five permanent members of  the Security Council are essentially in  agreement on how to do it, by bringing  in the United Nations, and by having  an internationally supervised free and  fair election. China is behind it, the  Soviet Union is behind it, the United  States is behind it, but Vietnam and  the puppet government in Cambodia  are not. If we now abandon the non Communists, we will  be  sending  a  signal to the Vietnamese that time is  on their side, and their incentive  to  make the concessions necessary to get  a  settlement will  be greatly dimin ished.  Now, it will be said by the opponents  of my amendment  that  the aid we  have given to the non-Communists in  the past had ended up in the hands of  the Khmer Rouge. That is simply not  true. I have looked into it. I have had  closed briefings on it, and there is not  a shred of credible evidence that any  of our aid to the non-Communists in  the past has ended up in the hands of  the Khmer Rouge. If it were true, I  would be leading the fight to cut off  this aid to the non-Communists, but it  is not true. It will also be said by oppo nents of my amendment that Prince  Sihanouk, who we are trying to help,  is a front man for the Khmer Rouge.  This  is hogwash. The best evidence  that it is hogwash is the fact that 1  month ago the Japanese convened a  conference  in Tokyo  to move  the  peace process on Cambodia forward.  All  the  Cambodian  factions  were  present, and at the end of the confer ence they had a communique calling  for a cease-fire and a political settle ment. Hun Sen signed  it, Sihanouk  signed it, Son Sanr signed it, but the  Khmer Rouge did not sign it. If Sihan ouk  is  a  front man  to  the Khmer  Rouge, why would he be signing agree ments opposed by the Khmer Rouge  and which exclude the Khmer Rouge  from power?  I urge Members, as does the adminis tration, as do all of the ASEAN ambas sadors, to support my amendment and  prevent  the Khmer Rouge from  re turning to power.  ",1990
814,738,11,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 4  minutes to the gentleman from Massa chusetts [Mr. ATKINS].  0 1600  ",1990
815,738,11,Mr. ATKINS.," Mr. Chairman,  for  many years we have all hoped for a  peaceful resolution to the terrible civil  war plaguing Cambodia. In the last 10  years,  this tiny country has endured  unspeakable acts of horror: genocide  at the hands of Khmer Rouge mani acs; starvation; concentration camps;  desperate poverty; unchecked disease;  and  the  limbs of children,  farmers,  and young mothers torn apart by so  many land mines that no one can even  remember who planted them and why  and where. This is the legacy of the  Khmer Rouge.  It would seem so obvious that of all  the great imponderables about Indo china, the only clear purpose for us as  a nation is to deliver the Cambodian  people from  the haunting fear  that  the Khmer Rouge will again visit upon  them a reign of terror. And, yet, ours  is a policy that every day breathes new  life  and  strength  into  the Khmer  Rouge. Ours is not a policy of malice  or evil intent; but it is one that has  grown so convoluted and so complex  that we have lost our way. The amend ment presently before us sustains this  misguided policy.  I  have  listened  to  the arguments  made by  the gentleman  from New  York in his efforts to restore funding  for those non-Communist forces who  are in league with the Khmer Rouge.  They are compelling and they are dy namic, but  they  represent only  the  wishful thinking of all of us who are  thousands of miles away from the re ality that is Indochina. With all my  hears, I wish it were true.  I must ask each of you, ""How is it  possible for us to support with exclu sivity  the non-Communist  resistance  that sits  in a war council with  the  Khmer Rouge?"" There  is no figleaf  large enough to obscure the fact that  for 10 years the non-Communist lead ers have shared their seat with  the  Khmer Rouge-with United States en couragement-at the United Nations,  proudly flying the Khmer Rouge flag  over U.N. Plaza. Is there no one among  us who  finds  irony  in the fact  that  Prince Sihanouk, the principal reposi tory of our largesse and our hopes for  democracy  in Cambodia, winters  in  Beijing and summers in North Korea?  It is  from  the same world  that the  Khmer Rouge and Prince Sihanouk  derive their sustenance. The credibil ity,  the materiel,  the  sources  of  strength are so intertwined, it is folly  to assume that the United States can  possess the ability to separate all of  these entities any longer.  On the 17th of June, Khmer Rouge  radio boasted of the military prowess  of the unified three-party national lib eration forces. Specifically, kudos were  offered  to  ""our national  resistance  forces who jointly attacked and com pletely  liberated  the  town of Kom pong Thom."" This is not-though with  all my heart, I wish it were-an isolat ed incident. This is the pattern. This is  the norm. These forces are in a fight  for their lives and they are not going  ",1990
816,751,11,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I want to com mend my distinguished colleague and  friend,  MARY ROSE OAKAR,  for her leadership in of fering an amendment to H.R. 5114,  the For eign Operations Appropriations bill  for  fiscal  year 1991. This amendment will provide $7.5  million  in economic support  funds  for Leba, non. The House unanimously authorized  the  same amount for Lebanon in fiscal year 1990  and fiscal year 1991 as part of Chairman FAS CELL's en bloc amendment.  We all know that the destruction and blood shed in Lebanon continues.  In a country with  a population of almost 3.2 million-and 15  years of cruel, armed conflict-there are esti mates that 150,000 have been killed and hun dreds of thousands more wounded, left home less, and in chronic dispair with no hope that  they will ever have a normal future. Of those  killed, 40,000 were children less than 15 years  of age, and another 90,000 were the adult ci vilian relatives of these children.  During  these  tragic  times  in  Labanon,  United States aid provides valuable support  and humanitarian assistance for the innocent  civilians and children who have suffered  the  most. Homes, schools, hospitals, and  the in frastructure have been destroyed with  little  hope  that  these symbols of possession and  nationhood will ever be  rebuilt or  restored.  This amendment would at least allow private  voluntary organizations and educational  insti tutions to carry out effective programs in hu manitarian,  relief, and  rehabilitation services.  These funds would also help provide portable  electricity  generators  and  portable  water  pumps  for hospitals and  family shelters and  displacement centers destroyed by the recur ring fighting.  These are only a few of the remedial steps  that can be taken with this assistance to help  alleviate some of the suffering and hardships  while diplomatic efforts are under way to solve  the political and military problems.  Mr. Chairman, since the Bush administration  has  recommended only $1 million  in  fiscal  year 1991  for Lebanon, Lebanon will  receive  this amount, at most, but could  receive a  small portion due to general provisions fund ing  in  the House bill  for economic support  funds, disaster assistance, and development  assistance. This Nation's assistance to Leba non is an  important symbol of support to the  people of  that beleaguered  country  letting  them know that the United States has not for gotten their tragic plight.  There are more than 3 million Americans of  Lebanese descent in the United States. In my  district and throughout greater Cleveland, hun dreds of my Lebanese constituents plead the  case for the United States to use its influence  to help restore peace  in Lebanon.  I support  their determination to ensure that Lebanon re mains a top priority on  the Bush administra tion's foreign policy agenda. The least we can  do now is support this amendment to provide  $7.5 million  in economic assistance funds  to  Lebanon.  Mr. McMILLAN of North Carolina. Mr. Chair man, today, we are like a drowning man in 30  feet of water who does not have the will  to  come up  for air and sinks  further with each  passing moment.  The latest CBO numbers estimate a deficit  of $159 billion in  fiscal year 1990 without in cluding the numbers from the ATC bailout of  the savings and loans. That is $49 billion over  the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  target of $110  billion.  The baseline deficit estimate  for  the fiscal  year 1991 deficit is $162 billion before looking  at the ATC numbers. That is $88 billion over  the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  target  for  that  year.  The projected baseline total outlays based  on existing law plus inflation is $1,287 billion  for 1991. It requires a reduction of 6.9 percent  or $90 billion to achieve the Gramm-Rudman Hollings  target even before ATC  funding.  If  you don't want to cut spending 6.9 percent,  then you apparently want to increase taxes by  close to 7.8 percent which is $88 billion bring ing revenues up to $1.211  trillion.  This amendment offered by my colleague  from Minnesota and myself is a bare minimum  this House should  to as a step toward rising  up to the fresh air of a balanced budget. This  amendment may save $300 million, peanuts  when you are talking about what really needs  in  is closer to $100 billion  to be done which  deficit reduction.  I would suggest that if you are really serious  about  reducing  the  deficit  according  to  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings targets without a full  tax increase of 7 .8 percent, then you are com pelled  to support this amendment  to  reduce  federal outlays.  If you don't, you should be  ready to support higher taxes.  The American people have already started  to blame Congress  for being asleep at  the  wheel during the savings and loan crisis. The  President showed his willingness to take politi cal difficult steps yesterday whether some of  us on  this side  like  it or not. Let's give him  and  the American people some hope  that  there  is still some semblance of  leadership  left in Congress.

821,764,11,Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA.," Mr. Speak er,  I  rise again  today, with a deep  sense of urgency, to focus our atten tion on the continuing human rights  violations occurring in the province of  Kashmir. Many children have been  killed and women have been raped as  Indian  troops unlawfully search  the  homes of  those people who support  the Kashmiri  independence move ment. Recent reports indicate that in  the past months, approximately 11,000  to 15,000 Kashmiri citizens have been  arbitrarily arrested or detained with out charge or trial for suspected  in volvement in the Kashmir independ ence movement. It appears as if these  human  rights  violations  are  being  committed with the complicity of the  Indian Government.  Mr. Speaker, I call upon the Bush  administration  to  investigate  the  human rights violations that are oc curring in Kashmir and to act immedi ately.  Mr. Speaker, I offer several relevant  newspaper articles and reports cover ing human rights violations in Kash mir.  [From the New York Times, June 15, 1990]  AMID KASHMIR ""PARADISE,"" A DEADLY  STRUGGLE  (By Barbara Crossette>  SRINAGAR, KASHMIR.-Silent, barefoot men  dug a very small grave recently at the Idgar  Martyrs' Cemetery, a new landmark on the  outskirts of  this battered city. The grave  was for 6-year-old Sajad Ahmad Sofi, shot  by Indian  troops, his relatives said, as he  tried  to  hide  between  his  father's  legs  during a search of the family home.  ""Put aside the malnutrition, the shortage  of vaccines, the gastroenteritis, the trauma,  the nightmares of children,"" said Altaf Hus sain, a pediatrician. ""Here we have 3-year olds, 4-year-olds subjected to bullets. And to  add insult to injury, we hear them dubbed  'terrorists'  on  the  evening  news  from  Delhi.""  Over the last two years, there has been a  silent revolution in the Kashmir Valley, the  verdant home  of  poetry  and  song  that  Mogul emperors called Paradise on Earth.  SEPARTISTS GAIN SUPPORT  Small groups of armed Muslim separatists,  who 15 months ago were described as a radi cal fringe attractive mostly to unemployed  youth, now apparently have the support of  an alienated, influential middle class.  Kashmiris say the introduction late last  year of  thousands of  Indian  troops and  paramilitary forces, who patrolled deserted  streets and searched houses only speeded up  a process of alienation that has been going  on for more than 40 years.  ""They have made every Muslim a  sus pect,""  a  businessman said of  the  Indian  armed forces' attempts  to subdue a  fast growing independence movement. ""We are  all militants now.""  More than 10,000 civil servants are said to  have signed an ""open letter to the citizens  of the world"" cataloguing the human toll of  extended curfews, violent searches, the in terrogations of young men and women, the  gang-rape of  a  bride  and  the  firing on  mourners carrying the body of the assassi nated religious  leader, Moulvi Mohammad  Farooq.  ""It was not bullets,"" the letter says, ""but  something worse than venom being poured  out of those guns that has shattered hun dreds of families, brought shame to Indian  democracy and left a scar on the psyche of  Kashmir that would never be removed.""  [In New Delhi,  Jagmohan, who  served  twice as Governor of Jammu and Kashmir  state, said in an interview that by the begin ning of his second term ""all the components  of power had been taken over by the terror ist or their supporters."" Mr. Jagmohan, who  uses only one name, served from April 1984  to July 1989 and  from January  through  May of this year. He was dismissed after  troops fired on a funeral procession, killing  at least 47.  [""By mid-1988,"" he said, ""they could call a  general strike and the government couldn't  do anything.  In  two years  they had  the  upper hand in every aspect of the establish ment-administration,  schools,  hospitals.""  The former governor said he had no alter native but  to  impose  long  curfews-one  lasted 16 days-and crack down on military  while  trying  to  rebuild  local  administra tion.]  HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORS BARRED  India bars international human rights or ganizations from visiting Kashmir, where all  foreigners must register with the police on  entering  the  valley. But  several  Indian  teams of concerned citizens have visited the  valley and written very critical reports.  In Srinager, Mufti Bahauddin Farooqi, a  former  chief  justice of  the  Jammu and  Kashmir High Court, and his son, Shoukat  Ahmed Farooqi, a lawyer, have begun docu menting  allegations  of human  and  civil  rights violations against Kashmiris.  Talking about their work in an interview  at Justice Farooqi's home,  they say  they  focus on both the state and administration  and on the array of federal forces deployed  here:  the  Indian Army, and paramilitary  Central Reserve Police Force,  the Border  Security Force,  the  Indo-Tibetan Border  Patrol, National Security Guards and vari ous intelligence agencies.  Troops in Srinagar alone have comman deered at least 15 hotels as well as guest  houses and private homes.  Justice Farooqi said the armed forces were  sent to Kashmir in contravention of Jammu  and Kashmir's special status in the Indian  Constitution.  ",1990

830,790,11,Mr. COATS.," Mr. President, I wish to  voice my strong support this morning  for a reduction in the capital gains tax  rate.  There is so much talk today in busi ness, academia, and government about  America's loss of its competitive edge.  So it is truly amazing that those same  voices are so seldom raised to discuss  something that will eventually lead to  the competitive decline of our econo my-the high price of capital.  The current capital gains  rate  in  America is among the highest of the  industrial democracies. Not coinciden tally, this economic policy has boosted  the cost of capital to the top of that  list as well.  Today we have the opportunity to  put this Nation's future growth and  prosperity at the top of our agenda by  giving strong support to S. 2744,  the  Economic Growth and Venture Cap ital Act of 1990. S. 2744 would lower  the current 33 percent rate, the high est since 1978,  to a maximum of 15  percent. This  legislation would also  end the unfair taxation of inflationary  gains, requiring instead that gains be  indexed to inflation. By this change,  only real gains will be taxed.  The current  level of capital gains  taxation discriminates against capital  income, impedes job creation, and un dercuts  America's  competitiveness  overseas by making the cost of capital  higher  for U.S.  companies. A  lower  capital gains rate would create new op portunities  for  economic growth by  stimulating new  investment and de creasing  the  cost of capital  in  the  United States.  In a recent speech, my friend Jack  Kemp very clearly set forth the bene fits  to  the economically underprivi leged of our country of a lower capital  gains rate:  The capital gains  tax reduction  isn't to  help the rich or secure old wealth, but to  free up or unlock old capital and old wealth  to help new business, new risktakers,  job  creation, and  economic growth. Virtually  every survey shows that the major problem  for inner city entrepreneurs is the absence  of  seed  capital. The  capital  gains  tax  reduction      will help ""unlock"" existing,  status-quo capital  to fund and support a  whole new generation of budding entrepre neurs in America's  inner cities where eco nomic opportunity is needed most.  Not only would a lower capital gains tax  rate help  the poor, but it would also  in  crease  tax  revenues. Lower capital gains  rates would greatly increase the number of  capital gains  transactions passing through  Federal, State, and local tax gates, raise the  total value of assets throughout the econo my, and make the economy bigger, more ef ficient, and more productive.  Mr. President, as the cold war comes  to a close, we seem to face a new inter national  reality. Success will not be  measured primarily by a military bal ance or control of strategic geography.  It will be counted and accumulated in  the currency of commercial competi tiveness. In this new international sit uation, a high capital gains tax  is a  form  of unilateral disarmament.  handicaps our  efforts  to  fight  for  newly opened markets. It slows our  ability to respond to change. It is sur rendering our advantages even before  we start.  It  ADVENTURE CAPITAL-THE REAL CAPITAL GAINS  CRISIS  ",1990
831,790,11,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President,  the  capital  gains  debate,  including  this  morning's statements during morning  business,  is  failing  to  focus on  the  most critical capital formation crisis in  America-the need for seed capital for  startup small businesses.  Seed capital investments go beyond  venture capital. They are often  re f erred  to as adventure capital. And,  more than any other type of invest ment, it is seed capital that will create  the new jobs, new technology, and new  markets of tomorrow.  What we need is a tax incentive that  will create a whole new adventure cap ital industry that provides seed capital  ",1990

833,803,11,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to join my colleagues in paying  tribute  to  the  senior Senator  from  North Dakota. QUENTIN'S 30 years of  service in the Senate have been good  for North Dakota;  they have been  good  for Nebraska;  and  they have  been good  for  the United States of  America. We owe him a debt of grati tude.  When I stop to think about my 12  years in the Senate and my longstand ing association with QUENTIN BURDICK,  I am reminded of the importance of  the fellowship we enjoy. The Senate  and the Nation run better in an atmos phere  of  trust  and  understanding.  QUENTIN BURDICK has always had my  trust and he has always approached  my  concerns  with  understanding.  There can be no higher tribute to a  legislator.  I could go on at length about all the  things he has done  for our United  States and all the tough decisions he  has made. But there is no way that  any summary I could give would be  complete. I will leave that task to his torians and scholars and close simply  by saying that QUENTIN BURDICK has  been a  true friend of agriculture, a  true friend of rural America, and a  true friend of JIM ExoN's.  NORTH  CAROLINA  DESERVES  ITS FAIR SHARE OF FEDERAL  FUNDS  ",1990
834,803,11,Mr. SANFORD.," Mr. President, there  are many arguments in favor of alter ing the formula for  the Community  Development Block Grant Program.  The current formula for the program  is extremely complex and tends to dis criminate against States  like North  Carolina that have a  relatively new  but substandard housing stock.  North  Carolina  has  tremendous  housing problems that can and should  be addressed by the CDBG program.  According  to a  recent study, nearly  250,000 households in North Carolina  lack running water or an indoor bath room. The State ranks second in the  Nation in the number of occupied sub standard housing units  trailing only  Texas. One rural county in northeast ern North Carolina has more occupied  homes without  complete  plumbing  than the entire State of Wyoming.  North Carolina  ranks 44th among  States  in median household  income,  and 13th in the percentage of families  below the poverty level. My State has  a  high  percentage  of  overcrowded  housing and ranks 10th in the Nation  in overall population.  From  these  statistics,  one would  think that the Community Develop ment Block Grant Program would pro vide  substantial assistance  to North  Carolina. But in fact the opposite is  true. Throughout the United States,  the per capita receipt of CDBG funds  totals $11.68, but the per capita re ceipt of CDBG funds in North Caroli na totals only $7.70.  This issue is of particular interest to  me because North Carolina has tradi tionally ranked close to last in the per  capita receipt of Federal funds. I have  tried to improve this situation over the  past few years-but the State in fiscal  year 1989 still ranked 48th.  To some degree, North Carolina's  poor performance in receiving Federal  assistance is due to the lack of Gov ernment contractors in the State. But  to a great extent, North Carolina has  been adversely affected by Federal for mulas  that are biased  toward other  States or regions of the country.  In the CDBG formula, I am particu larly concerned about the weight given  to the age of housing in each State.  The  inordinate weight given  to  this  variable  channels  additional CDBG  funds to older, more urban States and  leaves the rural States with newer, but  substandard housing conditions out in  the cold. I am also concerned that the  vast majority of funds are targeted to  the  entitlement program  for  large,  urban centers while the allocation for  the small cities program and the allo cation for rural areas suffer with small  funding totals.  I  recognize  that allocating CDBG  funds according to population presents  some problems because the allocation  will not reflect  the housing need  in  each State. However, this amendment  has taken an important step in identi fying the failure of the CDBG formu la  to  respond  to  housing  needs  throughout the Nation.  As a member of the Banking Com mittee,  I urge  the chairman of  the  committee, and the chairman of the  Housing Subcommittee  to reconsider  the current CDBG  formula  and  to  make appropriate changes that ensure  that North Carolina receives the share  of CDBG funds requisite with its terri ble housing problems.  AIDS UPDATE  ",1990
835,803,11,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, ac cording  to  the Centers  for Disease  Control, as of May 31, 136,204 Ameri cans have been diagnosed with AIDS;  81,906  Americans  have  died  from  AIDS; and 54,298 Americans are cur rently living with AIDS.  During  the month of May,  3,637  more Americans have developed AIDS  and 2,319 Americans have died from  this horrible disease.  AIDS: THE SECOND DECADE  Mr.  President,  the National Re search Council of the National Acade my of Sciences has published a hard hitting, comprehensive report on the  AIDS epidemic. The  report  tells us  that the number of AIDS cases will  continue to grow, with ""a continuing  toll of sickness and death"" for a larger  and larger number of Americans. The  report tells us that more teenage f e males are  infected  than ever before  and that the number of women with  AIDS has grown  from 6 percent  in  1982 to about 10 percent today.  The Council advocates  that a  far  greater share of  the Federal AIDS  dollar be spent on education and pre vention. As we know, AIDS is a pre ventable disease. What we don't tell  Americans can literally kill them.  I ask unanimous consent that an ar ticle from the Washington Post enti tled  ""U.S.  Report  Predicts Wider  Spread of AIDS,"" and a portion of the  National Research  Council's AIDS  report  summary be printed at  this  point in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Washington Post, June 21, 1990]  U.S. REPORT PREDICTS WIDER SPREAD OF  AIDS  <By Michael Specter)  SAN FRANCISCO, June 20.-The next decade  on  the AIDS epidemic will be worse and  more complex than the first, with the dis ease spreading among women and adoles cents and into demographic pockets that are  now considered ""safe,"" according to a three year study issued today by a branch of the  National Academy of Sciences.  The report was released by the National  Research Council on the opening day of the  Sixth  International  AIDS  Conference,  which was also marked by the arrest outside  the building of about 100 demonstrators  protesting U.S. immigration policies toward  AIDS victims.  The report states in blunt terms that, con trary  to  recent  reports  that suggest  the  AIDS epidemic may have peaked,  its ""di mensions are sizable and will continue  to  grow"" for years.  ""We can find little credible evidence that  the end of the AIDS epidemic is in sight,""  said Don C. Des Jarlais, vice chairman of  the  committee  and  an  expert on AIDS  among drug abusers.

843,816,11,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I  rise  in strong support of  the Cranston D' Amato substitute amendment to S.  566, the National Affordable Housing  Act.  First of all, I want to commend HUD  Secretary Kemp, Senator CRANSTON,  Senator D' AMATO, Senator MACK, and  others for working out a compromise  that,  if enacted, will  truly empower  the poor, create a ladder of opportuni ty out of poverty and bring the dream  of homeownership closer to all Ameri cans.  This agreement represents a dramat ic shift in the policies and priorities of  the original committee-reported hous ing bill. The agreement emphasizes  empowerment strategies that help the  poor over housing production. It pro vides more  flexibility  for State and  local governments to meet low-income  housing needs. And finally this legisla tion  includes  reforms  that will put  FHA back on the road to solvency.  I would also like to commend the ne gotiators  for  including most of  the  changes that I had suggested in my  proposed amendments.  One of my chief reservations about  S. 566 was that it did not target assist ance to the very poor. Only one-quar ter of the proposed HOP Block Grant  Program would be  targeted  to  the  worst-case  families-those with  in comes of less than 25 percent of an  area's median income. At a time when  these worst-case housing needs will  grow to 4.5 million by 1995, we must  target  scarce housing  funds  to  the  truly needy.  My amendment would have required  that 100 percent of HOP funds be used  for  the  benefit  of  very-low-income  families-those with incomes below 50  percent of an area median income and that families be selected for HOP  assistance on the basis of current pref erence  rules  for  low-income housing  programs. The  compromise  amend ment would target 90 percent of HOP  funds to very low-income families.  I am also pleased that the compro mise package restores the vital compo nents  of  the President's Operation  Bootstrap Program. Operation Boot strap  is  an attempt  to  apply  new  thinking  to America's housing prob lems. Under this program, public hous ing authorities would be required to  link vouchers and supportive services.  The recipients of housing aid will si multaneously be provided with  the  services they need in order to achieve  upward mobility-services  like  job  training, child care, and  transporta tion.  Operation Bootstrap  is a wholistic  approach to moving the poor toward  self-sufficiency. It is built on the basis  premise that Government assistance is  a two-way street: If the taxpayers pro vide  them housing assistance,  recipi ents should do everything they can to  achieve self-sufficiency and  join  the  economic mainstream.  Under  the  compromise, Operation  Bootstrap would be available  to all  PHA's, and it would be mandatory for  families with members  capable  of  working.  I  believe  that  low-income  families have an obligation  to work  ",1990

855,881,11,Mr. REID.," Many States, particularly  those in the Sun Belt, have large per centages of citizens living in manufac tured housing. Specifically,  they live  in housing  that before  1976 would  have been referred to as mobilehomes.  Some 26 percent of those in manufac tured homes are  retired, 29 percent  hold blue collar jobs, 23 percent have  income less than $10,000 and 35 per cent have income between $10,000 and  $19,999. In my State of Nevada, fully  18 percent of the population is housed  in mobilehomes. The numbers  are  similar  throughout  the South  and  Southwest. In Arizona it is 9.3 percent  and in Florida 16 percent. These sta tistics indicate mobilehomes are an at tractive housing alternative  for mil lions of Americans particularly those  of modest income.  Since  1980, manufactured  homes  have accounted for 14.2 percent of new  housing production and 29.4 percent  of all new single-family homes sold.  Approximately 10 percent of all Amer icans now live in mobilehomes. Under  existing law, mobilehome residents of  low-and very low-income who qualify  for section 8 rental assistance may use  the  benefits  for  both  homes  and  spaces, popularly known  as  ""pads.""  Despite  this authorization,  the pro gram is not working as intended.  In Nevada,  fair market  rents are  often set too low to assist with space  rentals. HUD  inflexibility on the es tablishment of fair market rents for  space rents has prevented section 8 as sistance  from  benefiting  a  large  number of otherwise qualified  low income individuals. Yet I believe the  National Affordable Housing Act con tains  one  possible  solution  to  this  problem.  Section 52l<b)(2) of the bill permits  the establishment of alternative fair  market  rent  schedules  that  reflect  rent variations within a market area. I  ask that,  in conference,  the Senator  from California make  explicit  that  such alternative schedules could  re flect  the actual cost of mobilehome  space rents within the market area of  a public housing agency.  ",1990
856,881,11,Mr. CRANSTON., I thank the Sena tor for bringing this important issue to  my attention.  I assure my colleague  that I will  take a close  look at this  issue before we proceed to conference.  I hope that an appropriate solution  can be found in conference.  ,1990
857,881,11,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr.  Presi dent, I wish to congratulate the Sena tors from New York and California for  crafting what is probably the most important piece of new housing legisla tion in a decade. Granted, this bill is  not perfect, but it contains some im portant new programs which will help  advance homeownership  and  reduce  homelessness in America.  I continue to have a strong personal  interest in housing policy which start ed over 20 years ago when I was an  aide to Governor Levander of Minne sota and worked on the creation of the  Minnesota Housing Finance Agency.  Unfortunately,  over  the  years,  our  housing problems have not gone away  but have metamorphosed  into new  problems which require new solutions.  This bill attempts to provide some of  these solutions.  All Americans should be given the  opportunity to own their own homes.  Secretary Kemp's HOPE Program  is  an  innovative way  to  provide  the  chance of homeowership to those in  society who would probably not have  an  opportunity  otherwise.  Such  a  major change  should not be made  overnight and I agree with the deci sion  to try this program on a small  scale first. I look forward to monitor ing the success of the HOPE Program  to see if it should be expanded in the  future.  Clearly, we need fresh  thinking in  the delivery of public housing to those  in  need. Many  of  today's housing  projects are in an advanced degree of  decay and some are even abandoned this at a time when we are experienc ing soaring rates of homelessness and  a drop in affordable housing. We must  do better.  I have some  reservations  about  the consolidation of so many  good housing programs within HOPE  but I am willing to support this experi ment in the search of a simplified de livery  system  for  public  housing  grants.  I believe the prepayrnent provisions  in S. 566 adequately address one of the  most  acute  problems  facing  public  housing  today-the potential  loss of  much of our public housing stock to  mortgage prepayment. The ""preserva tion value"" stipulation in S. 566 gives  adequate return  to private  investors  while allowing  the public  to benefit  from the continued availability of low cost housing.  On FHA, I am extremely wary of the  trend toward insolvency of this impor tant program. While it is both politi cally and socially painful to increase  the costs  to home buyers under the  FHA Program, I believe  it is clearly  fiscally pruduent to keep this program  solvent and operational for the long  term. We cannot afford another S&L  type debacle. Some personal fiscal dis comfort in the short term is necessary  to keep our costs down  in the  long  term.  The dark blotch of homelessness  continues to mar the picture of hous ing in America. I joined with several of  my colleagues in attaching an amendment to start a $452 million program  to help prevent homelessness, and as sisting those who have become home less in receiving counseling and place ment into  transitional housing. This  program will not end homelessness,  but it is another step in the long jour ney  toward reducing  this  intractable  problem.  I  look forward to working with my  colleagues on further housing legisla tion in the future as we continue to  look for better ways to improve hous ing opportunities for all Americans.  PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES  ",1990
858,881,11,Mr.  SARBANES.," Mr.  President,  many public housing authorities have  begun acquiring and developing  low cost housing units using a variety of  funding  sources by piecing  together  private, State, and local resources as  other nonprofit housing groups have  done.  I think this activity reflects the very  spirit of the HOP Program we are en acting, and we should encourage it.  Public housing authorities CPHA's]  have  extensive  development  experi ence and a commitment to expanding  the supply of affordable housing. As  public  housing  development  funds  have been scaled back, many PHA's  are developing low-cost housing that is  not traditional public housing and has  no Federal assistance under the Public  Housing Program.  Unfortunately,  the  lowest  income  members  of our  society  frequently  cannot afford the rents which must be  charged even in low-rent housing units  owned  by  public  housing  agencies.  Thus, many low-income families need  section 8  rental assistance, whether  project-based or tenant-based, to live  in these units. However, I understand  that HUD has been discouraging this  activity by PHA's through restrictive  regulations against the use of section 8  rental assistance in PHA-owned units.  I am unaware of any statutory basis  for  the  restrictive HUD  view  and  would  like  to ask  the distinguished  chairman of the Housing Subcommit tee, Senator CRANSTON, whether he  agrees with my concern that this re striction is contrary to our intent that  PHA's fully participate in the effort to  provide affordable housing and to re ceive and use HOP funds just as any  other nonprofit group may.  ",1990
859,881,11,Mr. CRANSTON.," I share the con cern of  the Senator from Maryland  and note that this bill abolishes the  separate category of public housing  development grants, with the expecta tion  that public housing authorities  will compete for Federal development  funds as any private nonprofit group  might. Any HUD  regulations which  prevent PHA's from developing hous ing with HOP grants and accepting  section 8 assistance, whether tenant based or project-based, would be con trary to the intent of Congress; and I  ",1990
860,959,11,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President, I would  venture to say there are few Members  of Congress who are as forceful, vigor ous, or effective in their support for  Israel as our distinguished colleague  Senator  PACKWOOD.  Senator  PACK WOOD has not only been a  friend of  Israel, but one of its leading champi ons on Capitol Hill.  Earlier  this month, Senator PACK WOOD  delivered  a  stirring  speech  before the American Israel Public Af fairs Committee Policy Conference. In  his  remarks, Senator PACKWOOD  re views the history of Israel from the  6th century B.C. to the present, and  addresses the question of Israel's claim  to Judea and Samaria. I believe that  these remarks warrant the attention  of my colleagues and others who are  interested in the question of recent de velopments in the Middle East.  I ask unanimous consent that his re marks be entered into the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the  re marks were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  SPEECH OF SENATOR BOB PACKWOOD AT  AIPAC POLICY CONFERENCE, June 11, 1990  I had forgotten it was 11 years ago when I  last spoke to this conference. I  remember  this speech. It was a whale of a good speech,  I  thought. I've no invitation to come back  since that time. I can't help but feel a little  bit like the revenuer down  in the hills of  Kentucky walking down the road. He sees a  young boy alongside of the road whittling  on  a  stick and he  says,  ""Mornin' son.""  ""Mornin'."" ""Where's your dad, son."" ""Up at  the still."" ""Oh, up at the still, making whis key?"" ""Um-hum."" ""Well, son, I'm rather in terested  in that type of business, do you  think you can take me up there and let me  see his place of operation."" The kid nods  but he doesn't move and he keeps whittling  on the stick and the revenuer says, ""Well,  son, I really would like to go up and see this  thing. Can we go up now."" The kid says,  ""Yep,"" but he doesn't move. Then finally  the revenuer somewhat in frustration says,  ""Son, let me tell you something. I'm a feder al man. You can trust my word. Now take  me up there and when we come back I'll  give you a buck."" The kid says, ""No, I want  my buck now mister, you ain't comin' back.""  Sort of the same way I felt after that last  conference when  I  spoke here. And  then  when Ruth Mentioned NYU, that's a  true  story, but it wasn't quite the backwoods. I  was raised in Portland, Oregon. But indeed I  had no  Jewish background, no  tradition,  never met anyone named Cohen in all my  life until I went off to NYU Law School.  Then they called the roll: Abraham Cohen,  Benjamin Cohen, David Cohen .... But the  most enjoyable experience for me at NYU  was not a Cohen, but a Berger, who is here  tonight. Paul Berger, who was a classmate  of mine, took me aside and taught me all of  the lore and tradition, and most especially  the love of the Jewish religion. He taught  me  the dietary  laws,  taught me why he  wouldn't work, wouldn't turn on the lights,  wouldn't ride elevators, wouldn't make any body else work on Saturday. He would read  by daylight. That was all right. We lived on  the 7th  floor  and on Saturday morning  when I would be going down to get the New  York Times, he would ask me to get him a  copy if I did not take the elevator. So down  I'd go, seven floors down, pay for the Times,  seven  floors back up, and give Paul his  Times. He spent three years with me teach ing me the history, and the tradition, and  the love. I was there during the '56 war. It  was a stunning experience for a kid with no  Jewish background to see the affect that it  had on his classmates in a school that was  probably 70 to 75 percent Jewish. So I left  that law school a changed person because of  the school, and especially because of Paul. I  never intended to stay in New York. I went  back to Oregon hoping to go  into politics,  and I did.  Finally, I came to the Senate, a committed  zealot. In the years  that I've been  there,  nothing has changed in my judgment. I've  been to Israel on a number of occasions and  each  time  I go  the fortification becomes  stronger. And If I were arguing for the posi tion of the United States and Israel, I would  argue for it on a moral plane. Not so much a  geopolitical plane.  Is  Israel a  sensational  ally? Of course. Are they the most extraor dinary  intelligence post we  have  in  the  world? Of course. But geopolitical  argu ments. often give the impression of arguing  power; strength, and if you  lose that you  lose your credibilty. But if your argument is  morality, you may lose battles on occasion,  but in the long run you win the wars.  So let's take a look, historically, at Israel  and the moral claims. I could make an argu ment, and I would be prepared to defend an  argument that there is no better historical  claim to Judea and Samaria than the Jews.  It was not fault that we were kicked out by  the Babylonians in the 6th Century B.C., or  by the Romans shortly after the start of the  Christian Period. And don't  say we were  kicked out and left voluntarily. Don't say  that to  the Maccabees. Don't say that to  those who  spent  three years on  top of  Masada. Don't  say  that  to Bar Kochba.  They may have been defeated in battle, but  they left a legacy and memory and morality  that pinions a claim that in my judgment is  still legitimate.  But if we want to talk about geopolitics, if  you want to talk about who had the most ef fective rule in the Middle East for the long est period of  time,  it's probably Rome.  I  haven't  seen  any  recent  claim  that we  should give the West Bank to Italy because  of that. Turkey ruled the Middle East for  400 years roughly from 1500 to the end of  World War I. But they made the mistake of  ending up on the wrong side allied with Ger many in World War I. But they had it for  400 years. Ruled it badly, ineffectively, but  they were  sovereign. However,  I  haven't  seen any serious Turkish claims to any part  of Israel. Well, people say that's ancient his tory. Who  is going back to the Diaspora?  Who's going back  to Rome? Who's going  back to Turkey? Let's talk about this centu ry. O.K., let's talk about this century.  Turkey had  the Middle East.  they had  what was Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and  other portions of the Middle East. There  were none of these countries that we now  know at the turn of the century. Britian and  France at the end of World War I, simply  took  the Middle East from Turkey. They  said that there were going to divide it up be tween us. France  took what is now Syria  and Lebanon. Britian took what is now Iraq,  Jordan, and Israel. But at the time it was  simply a division between the two winning  powers. And then the Balfour Declaration,  of course, said some place out of the British  portion in this division would come a home land for the Jews. And that was confirmed  at the San Remo Agreement in 1920. Con firmed by the League of Nations who said  fine. Some place in  the territory there is  going to be homeland for the Jews.  And then what happened? The Emir Ab dullah, the grandfather of the present King  Hussein, had probably the best Arab army  in the area. And he'd been dealt out. He  didn't get a country. And so he decided he  would move on Damascus, which was in the  French  territory. And the French said  to  the British, ""Look he's in your part. You do  something."" So what did  the British do?  They created the country of Transjordan.  ""Trans"" meaning across-east of the Jordan  River. It was 80 percent of the then-existing  Palestinian mandate-80 percent. And on  the day the country of Transjordan was cre ated,  it was closed  to Jewish settlement.  And what few Jewish settlers were  there  were expelled or worse. Buy there was no  outcry from world Jewry. Don't give me this  argument about are the Jews willing to give  up land for peace. They gave up 80 percent  of  the mandate  in  the hopes of getting  peace.  And then what happens during the '20s  and '30s? You have terrorism on both sides.  I'm not going to get into an argument here  as to who was better or worse. You had inci dents of terrorism on both sides in the re maining mandate. The British has a terrible  problem trying to keep peace among any body. Finally,  they created a  commission  called the Peel Commission in 1937 to rec ommend how the mandate should be divid ed.  The  Peel Commission  said Britian  should keep Jerusalem, the Arabs would get  the West Bank and  the Negev,  the Jews  would get Northern Israel. I want to empha size again what  this division was. Britian  would keep Jerusalem, the Arabs would get  the West Bank and the Negev, we would get  the rest. And who accepted it, We did, the  Jews did. Who turned it down? The Arabs,  when they could have had the West Bank  and the Negev, and the mandate remaining  in Jerusalem. Don't tell me we weren't will ing to give up land for peace.  In 1938, the Jewish Agency itself suggest ed a partition of the remainder of the man date. Jerusalem would now be divided under  the Jewish Agency suggested partition, be tween  the British Jews. The Arabs would  still get  the West Bank and most of the  Negev, and  the Jews would get Northern  Israel. Again, this was turned down by the  Arabs. This  is  the Jewish Agency making  the suggestion.  In 1946, the Jewish Agency made another  suggestion, that Jerusalem should be inter nationalized. Not a suggestion that it be in  ",1990

The Silvio 0.

878,1011,11,Mr. CONTE.," Certainly no  one has committed  themselves more com pletely or  tirelessly over  the years  to  the  cause of education  than he. As Mr. CONTE,  himself, put it, he learned early in his own life  that anything that strengthens America, such  as education,  is worth  fighting  for. No more  forceful advocate of public education has ever  served this Nation.  I was profoundly pleased and gratified  to  participate in OSIA's glowing tribute to this ex traordinary public servant, as I know were my  colleagues, Messers. D'AMATO, NATCHER, and  WHITTEN.  Moreover,  I commend OSIA and  the Sons  of Italy Foundation for its longtime and stead fast commitment  to education. The National  Leadership Grants  represent merely OSIA's  national manifestation of an annual scholar ship  program  that  covers  activities  in  35  States and exceeds $500,000  in yearly  lar gesse. As the oldest and largest organization  representing Italian Americans, with more than  450,000 members  spread  throughout  the  Nation, OSIA has contributed more than $12  million to education since 1968 alone.  Finally, I ask that President Bush's laudatory  remarks,  read aloud at the award ceremony  by OSIA's  national  executive  director, Dr.  Philip  A.  Piccigallo,  be  reprinted  in  the  RECORD in their entirety.  THE WHITE HOUSE,  Washington, June 5, 1990.  I am delighted  to send greetings  to all  those gathered in our Nation's Capital for  the Educational Conference of  the Order  Sons of Italy  in America. My congratula tions to your National Leadership Grant re cipients and to Congressman Silvio Conte,  to whom you are paying special tribute.  Sil Conte is one of our Nation's most dis tinguished Italian-American legislators. His  outstanding leadership in the House of Rep resentatives,  including his efforts to make  excellence the spur of our national educa tion system, make it especially fitting that  the Order Sons of Italy in America establish  a scholarship in his name. The Silvio Conte  Scholarship will certainly be an inspiration,  for it honors a man whose patriotism, loyal ty, and dedication to the public good serve  as an example to all Americans.  Barbara joins me in sending best wishes to  Sil and to all of you for an enjoyable and  productive conference.  GEORGE BUSH.  TRIBUTE TO HERB BUTLER  HON.GEORGE(BUDDY)DARDEN  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 27, 1990  ",1990
879,1011,11,Mr. DARDEN.," Mr. Speaker, one of the hard est working men in Georgia, Herb Butler, is re tiring  this year. Herb  first  joined  local 10  in  1945 at the Bell-Marietta aircraft plant. He has  served with distinction in several different po sitions of responsibility within the union, culmi nating in his current position as area director  for Atlanta and vicinity.  His  interests and  talents go beyond his  union work. He was  appointed  by  former  16085  Georgia Gov. George Busbee  to  the State  Board of Natural Resources, where he has  played an  important role in bringing attention  and action  to  the effort to protect Georgia's  parks, natural resources, and environment. He  has been a leader in civil rights and charitable  programs in Georgia. His efforts in the work place and the community have not gone un recognized  as  he  has  received  numerous  awards for his service.  Herb  is being honored on July 2 by  the  UAW local 1 O and some of his many friends  as he prepares for his retirement. His active  presence will certainly he missed, but he  is  deserving of some  time  for himself and his  family. No doubt, Herb will continue to serve  his community and his State, and-I look for ward  to seeing him enjoy this new phase of  his life.  A TRIBUTE TO MR. JEFF FAINE  AND DR. ALBERT ARAN  HON. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 27, 1990  Ms.  ROS-LEHTINEN.  Mr.  Speaker, Mr.  Chaim Khaves, a Soviet Jew who emigrated  to south Florida 2 months ago, is able to see  his new country with clearer vision  thanks to  surgery donated by Dr. Albert Aran, a north  Miami physician.  On June 19, 1990, Mr. Chaim Khaves  re ceived cataract and pseudo exfoliation surgery  to correct his vision  that made him  legally  blind in his right eye. Performed at the Visual  Health and Surgical Center, MediVision, doc tors removed a cloudy buildup on his eye that  hampered his vision.  Mr. Jeff Faine, general director of MediVi sion, heard about Mr. Khaves' eye problems  from synagogue members. He sought the sup port of Dr. Albert Aran, the medical director of  MediVision. Dr. Aran performed the surgery at  no cost to Mr. Khaves.  Mr. Khaves and his daughter, Freda, had  been  trying  to come  to  the United States  since 1979. They finally arrived in April under  a program coordinated by the Jewish Family  Services of Broward County. Members of local  synagogues adopt Soviet  families and help  them find homes and employment.  The assistance that Mr. Jeff Faine and Dr.  Albert Aran contributed to Mr. Chaim Khaves  is extraordinary. These two gentlemen under stand the nature of giving and they ought to  be commended for all of their efforts. I thank  these two individuals for reminding us of the  special pride we all  feel when we give  to  others.  ACHIEVEMENT AGAINST THE  ODDS  HON.

881,1024,11,Mr. SHUMWAY.," Mr. Speaker,  I,  too, say  let's cut Govenment waste, not raise taxes.  I  just cannot comprehend how we can sit here  in Congress and authorize one pork barrel  project after another, and  then  turn around  and  tell  the American people  that we must  raise their taxes!  One example of unthinking runaway spend ing occurred recently when the Education and  Labor Committee authorized $12 million for a  new building for the Washington Center, which  offers  internships and academic seminars  to  college students.  I am pleased to report that  some of us in the House were able to at least  stall that effort last week.  Obviously,  in certain cases, sponsoring an  intern  is  justified. However,  this  particular  project demonstrates the blindness with which  some of my colleagues choose to spend the  taxpayers' money.  In effect, the aurhorization  would allow for the building of a private uni versity. Furthermore,  the belief  that  it would  aid  underprivileged  students  is  unfounded:  Only about  16  percent of  these  students  would receive scholarship funds. At a time of  huge budget deficits, we have no business  spending $122 million in this manner.  Such a lack of responsible spending has to  end, now! Those participating in the so-called  ""budget summit"" need  to be  reminded  that  there is far too much existing waste to justify  any new taxes!  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  June 27, 1990  TRIBUTE TO ED RAMON  HON. JAMES M. INHOFE  OF OKLAHOMA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 27, 1990  ",1990
882,1024,11,Mr.  INHOFE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay tribute to a true American  for his valiant  efforts  for his  country and his  friends. Ed  Ramon, a Shoshone-Comanche  Indian resid ing  in my district, earned 42 military decora tions during his two tours in Vietnam as heli copter pilot. One has to ask why a man would  go back for a second tour in Vietnam. ""It was  because my buddies were still  there  fighting  and dying,'' he  told me.  ""I  thought  I could  make a difference,'' said Ramon.  To the many young men who he evacuated,  Ed Ramon did make  the difference-the dif ference between  life and death-the biggest  difference in the whole world.  Like so many soldiers returning  from Viet nam, Ed found a new perspective on life. Do mestic problems, dealing with his memories of  Vietnam,  and  his brother's suicide due  to  postwar depression instilled the desire to pub lish an anthology of poems about his experi ences.  His collection, entitled  ""Scars and Stripes  Forever,'' has the ability to provide strength to  many veterans who have found themselves in  this same postwar situation.  I applaud Ed  for all  the work he has done  for his country and for his fellow soldiers. On  May 30, 1990, at Driller's Park in Tulsa, OK, I  will have the honor of presenting Ed Ramon  with many of his decorations earned  in Viet nam. I am proud to be acquainted with a true  American like Ed Ramon.  s. 2615  HON. HARLEY 0. STAGGERS, JR.  OF WEST VIRGINIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 27, 1990  ",1990
883,1024,11,Mr. ST AGGERS.," Mr.  Speaker,  today,  I,  along with DOUG APPLEGATE, DON EDWARDS,  LANE EVANS, CLAUDE HARRIS, GEORGE HOCH BRUECKNER, L.F. PAYNE, and JOHN ROWLAND,  all members of  the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee, have  introduced  legislation  that  would allow veterans alleged to owe debts to  the Department of Veterans Affairs to be per mitted the same right that nearly every other  American  citizen  enjoys  in  debt  collection  cases,  to employ counsel  to  represent and  defend against what, in some cases, is an im proper allegation of debt and unwarranted  debt collection efforts.  In April,  the Housing and Memorial Affairs  Subcommittee held an oversight hearing  re garding  the Home Loan Guaranty Program.  Several witnesses at  that hearing discussed  the very difficult position that veterans are in  when their OVA guaranteed home loan is de faulted upon.  Two of our witnesses testified that without  the assistance of legal counsel their attempts  to  fight what  they considered  to be unjust  claims would be impossible.  It is a very diffi cult system to work under without legal advice  since,  in many cases,  the veteran may not  even be aware of an  indebtedness until col lection efforts have begun.  The  legislation  that  I, along with my col leagues on the House Veterans' Affairs Com mittee, have  introduced here  today calls  for  the lifting of the prohibition on allowing attor neys to be employed when the OVA is collect ing debts from veterans. In debt collection the  full weight of  the government can be em ployed  to collect with assistance  inside and  outside the Government, to deny veterans as sistance of attorneys  is  ludicrous. Not only  many debt collection efforts hurt  the credit  rating of the veterans, for active duty person nel it may mean the denial of a security clear ance; the effective end of an otherwise excel lent military career.  One needs to be mindful  that  the OVA  in  debt collection cases cannot be both the vet eran's friend and the agency charged with ag gressively pursuing debt collection. To deny  the veteran the opportunity to have a zealous  advocate is to deny the precis of the funda mental of due process enjoyed by citizens of  our great nation.  This legislation is similar to S. 2615-intro duced by Senate Veterans' Affairs Chairman  Mr.  CRANSTON  and Mr.  ROCKEFELLER,  a  member of the committee. I expect S. 2615 to  receive prompt attention in the Senate.  I urge my colleagues  to  join with me and  allow veterans the right to adequately defend  themselves.

Schiff, of Kentucky, to be an Assistant  ",1990
884,1050,11,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Chairman, I want to com mend Chairman  TRAXLER,  ranking member  GREEN and all members of the VA-HUD-Inde pendent Agencies Subcommittee for the new  budget priority which  they have placed on  HUD and housing assistance for our Nation's  low-income families.  As Chairman GONZALEZ mentioned,  the  Banking Committee has  reported  out H.R.  1180, the Housing and Community Develop ment Act of 1990. While I do not wish to mini mize the contributions made by the Appropria tions Committee here  in H.R.  5158,  I  feel  compelled  to express some disappointment  over the issue of timing. Unlike the pessimistic  outlook expressed  in  the committee's report  on H.R. 5158, my personal feeling is that the  passage of housing authorization legislation is  very likely during this session. It was my hope  that the committee would give recognition  to  the efforts of  the Banking Committee and  Secretary Kemp by, at the minimum, including  a  line  item  for certain  important priorities  in  H.R. 1180.  In this regard, I am concerned that the fund ing provided in the loan management account  for preservation of  low-income housing may  be  inadequate. As  the subcommittee mem bers are well aware,  the prepayment of low income housing stock is one of the most diffi cult housing  issues facing  the Congress  this  year. The Banking Committee has devised a  permanent, bipartisan solution to the prepay ment problem.  It  is my hope  that, either  in  conference or  in a supplemental appropria tion,  a  permanent  solution  to  low-income  housing preservation will be funded.  Mr. Chairman,  I would  like to bring up  the  subject of FHA  just briefly.  I commend  the  committee's necessary $10 milllion increase in  FHA staff  funding. Given  the  importance of  the FHA's contribution to affordable, multifam ily rental housing, it is gratifying to see author izers and appropriators working  together  to  improve the FHA's multifamily insurance pro grams. Moreover,  the  recently  completed  Price Waterhouse study has forcefully pointed  out  the existing problems with  the Federal  Housing Administration's single  family  insur ance fund. One of the key recommendations  of that study warned against raising  the FHA  high cost mortgage  limits without first  taking  certain reform actions.  In concert with Chair man GONZALEZ and other members of  the  Banking Committee, we will  include  FHA  reform in housing authorization legislation this  year in order to restore actuarial soundness to  FHA.  In the interim, I am pleased to see that  H.R. 5158 is consistent with our housing au thorization bill and recognized the importance  of leaving the FHA high cost mortgage limits  at $124,875.  Finally,  I would  like  to comment on one  other issue. The public housing drug elimina tion program plays a key  role  in protecting  and enhancing the lives of public housing ten ants  in  this country. While  the program  is  funded at $100 million in H.R. 5158, this level  falls short of the President's request for $150  million. Moreover,  together with  the  ranking  member of  the  full committee, Mr. CONTE,  I  have authorization pending on an adjunct pro gram,  the Public Housing Youth Sports Pro gram. Funded  from drug elimination grants,  the Public Housing Youths Sports Program will  provide the youth in public housing an effec tive alternative to drug use. It is my hope that  the funding for the Drug Elimination Program  might be increased some time in the future.  Again, Mr. Chairman,  I want  to give great  credit  to  the  subcommittee  chairman, Mr.  TRAXLER,  and  the  ranking  member, Mr.  GREEN,  for their leadership and hard work on  H.R. 5158. The competing priorities  included  within Veterans, HUD, and  the  independent  agencies appropriation make for some difficult  choices. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  ",1990
885,1050,11,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to  rise in strong support of H.R. 5158, a measure  to appropriate a total of $83.6 billion in fiscal  year 1991 new budget for the Departments of  Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban De velopment.  I commend  the gentleman  from Missouri  [Mr. TRAXLER]  for  introducing  this  important  measure, and  the distinguished chairman of  the Veterans Committee, the gentleman from  Mississippi  [Mr. MONTGOMERY] and  the rank ing minority members, the gentleman from Ari zona  [Mr. STUMP]  for  their unceasing efforts  on behalf of our Nation's veterans.  H.R. 5158 authorizes an  increase of $12.3  billion over the fiscal year 1990 budget. This  measure not only increases funds for the De partments of Veterans Affairs and Housing  and Urban Development, but also includes the  National Aeronautics and Space Administra tion, the National Science Foundation and the  Environmental Protection Agency.  Mr. Chairman, our support of this measure  confirms the support in Congress for our vet erans by increasing funding to VA. H.R. 5158  will provide $31.3 billion to fund the Veterans  Health Service and Research Administration.  This includes increases in medical care, medi cal and prosthetic  research, as well as  in creases in compensation and benefits.  In regard to health care programs and per sonnel, H.R. 5158 will  increase  funding by  $1.6 billion more than  fiscal year 1990. This  measure will enable the steps that have been  taken to improve the quality of health care for  our Nation's veterans to continue, as well as,  to enhance the recruitment and retainment of  qualified personnel for the Department of Vet erans Affairs.  Mr. Chairman,  funding programs  that will  help our Nation's veterans has continued  to  be a major concern. H.R. 5158 will provide  $12.3 billion directly to the Department of Vet erans Affairs to make certain that the problem  ",1990
886,1076,11,Mr. PENNY.," I yield to the gentle man from North Carolina.  Mr. McMILLAN of North Carolina.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  amendment.  Mr. Speaker, today, we are like a drowning  man  in 40  feet of water who does not have  the will  to come up  for air and sinks further  with each passing moment.  The latest CBO numbers estimate a deficit  of $159 billion  in  fiscal year 1990 without in cluding the numbers from the ATC bailout of  the savings and loans. That is $49 billion over  the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  target of $110  billion.  The baseline deficit estimate  for the  fiscal  year 1991 deficit is $162 billion before looking  at the ATC numbers. That is $88 billion over  the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  target  for  that  year.  CBO projects total baseline outlays plus in flation of $1,287 billion for 1991. That would  require a reduction of 6.9 percent or $90 bil lion  to achieve  the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  target even before ATC funding.  If you aren't  willing to cut projected outlays by 6.9 percent,  not much more  than a freeze at  last year's  level, when you apparently are willing  to  increase taxes by close to 7.8 percent which is  $90 billion to bring revenues up to $1.211  tril lion. The amendment offered by my colleague  from Minnesota is a bare minimum this House  should do as a stroke toward rising up to the  fresh air of a balanced budget. This amend ment may save only peanuts when you are  talking about what  really needs  to be done  which is closer to $100 billion in deficit reduc tion.  I would suggest that if you are really serious  about  reducing  the  deficit  according  to  Gramm-Rudman targets without a full  tax  in crease of 7.8 percent, then you are compelled  to support this amendment to reduce Federal  outlays. If you don't, you should be ready  to  support higher taxes.  The American people have already started  to blame Congress  for being asleep at  the  wheel during the savings and loan crisis. The  President showed his willingness to take politi cally difficult steps yesterday whether some of  us on  this side  like  it or not. Let's give him  and  the American people some hope  that  there  is still some semblance of  leadership  left in Congress. Vote for this amendment.  Mr. GREEN  of New York. Mr.  Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment. Again, I would point out  to my colleagues that the increase in  this bill are substantial, though they  are largely the increases requested by  the President. We  are $500 million  plus, below, in outlays what the Presi dent  requested. We  are within our  302(b) allocations, both as  to budget  authority and as to outlays. The 2-per cent cut is said to be nominal cut, but  it will have the effect of reducing the  NASA budget by $285 million, which I  would suggest is more than a nominal  cut in NASA. The 2-percent cut is said  to be a nominal cut, will have  the  effect of cutting the National Science  Foundation appropriation by $46 mil lion, which I have to tell the gentle man in that account is more than a  nominal cut. It will leave NASA $1.1  million below the President's request.  It will  leave  the National Science  Foundation  $92 million  below  the  President's request.  The President,  in his statement of  administration policy on this bill, has  criticized  the cuts  that we have al ready made in his request, and I par ticularly urge those of my colleagues  on the Republican side who want to  support the Presidential request of the  National Science Foundation, NASA,  and other agencies, to vote against the  amendment.  ",1990
887,1076,11,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  Mr. GREEN of New York. I yield to  the gentleman from Minnesota.  ",1990
888,1076,11,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Chairman, I have  two quick questions. My first question,  with the 2 percent in either of the in stances the gentleman cited, National  Aeronautics and Space Administration  and the National Science Foundation,  will we be spending less in fiscal year  1991 than in 1990?  Mr. GREEN of New York. I know we  will not in the space program. I will do  the calculations for the National Sci ence Foundation program, although I  would rather doubt it there.  Again, as the gentleman knows, the  President wants to double the funding  for  the National Science Foundation  over a 5-year period. Again, we have  undertaken a lot of things which are  now wrapping us up as we knew when  we voted  for  them last year  in the  NASA  program, most  notably  the  space station. It seems to me the cuts  the gentleman will want to make will  be very destructive. We have already  gone well under what the President re quested on both of these items. I hope  my colleagues will not cut  requests  further.  ",1990
889,1076,11,Mr. PENNY.," If the gentleman will  continue to yield, the second question  I have, given the fact my amendment  could  reduce  in  total somewhat  less  than $1 million in appropriations from  this bill, could  the gentleman share  with  the  membership  the  dollar  amount,  the difference between  the  appropriated level in fiscal year 1990  and fiscal year 1991?  D 1500  Mr. GREEN  of New York. The  dollar difference in this bill?  ",1990
890,1076,11,Mr. PENNY.," As compared to fiscal  year 1990.  Mr. GREEN of New York. There are  a lot of different items, as the gentle man knows, as between outlays.  ",1990
891,1076,11,Mr. PENNY.," Is it true the increase is  somewhere in the neighborhood of $12  billion, and my amendment would cut  maybe $1 billion?  Mr. GREEN  of New York. Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  the gentleman  is  absolutely correct in that. I think the  gentleman ought to understand that  of that $12 billion, to use his number,  $7 billion in budget authority simply  deals with the fact that section 8 exist ing housing contracts and other simi lar contracts are expiring.  ",1990
892,1076,11,Mr. PENNY.," Yes.  Mr. GREEN of New York. They  have to be replaced or those families  will get evicted because  they cannot  afford  the  rent. The President  re quested that, Secretary Kemp has re quested that, and if the gentleman is  requesting that we ought to cut 2 per cent out of  that,  then he  is simply  saying that we are going to be throw ing some families out of the street be cause we are not going to provide the  full amount of money the President  requested and  that Secretary Kemp  said is necessary.  ",1990
893,1076,11,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Chairman, I appre ciate  that observation, and  it  is  for  that reason that I exempted those sec tion 8 housing programs from my cut.  ",1990

896,1089,11,Mr. COYNE.," Mr. Speaker, on June 25, over  6,000 people attended the Annual Conference  of the Air and Waste Management Associa tion  in Pittsburgh. One of Pittsburgh's distin guished citizens, Paul H. O'Neill, addressed  the conference and set forth his proposal for  addressing simultaneously the three problems  of environmental quality, energy conservation,  and the Federal budget deficit.  I commend Mr. O'Neill's remarks to my col leagues because of his unique experience as  chairman and CEO of ALCOA, his  tenure as  Deputy Director of the Office of Management  and Budget in the Ford administration, and his  concern as a private citizen.  39-059 0-91-35 (Pt. 11)  ",1990

903,1115,11,Mr. NUNN.," Mr. President,  today I  join with  several  of my  colleagues  from the Senate Armed Services Com mittee in outlining a program designed  to harness some of the resources of  the Defense Establishment-the De fense Department, certain elements of  the  intelligence community, and  the  national security activities of the De partment of Energy-to confront the  massive  environmental  problems  facing our Nation and the world today.  These are problems that will pose an  increasing threat to our national secu rity in the years ahead.  During our committee's markup of  the fiscal year 1991 Defense authoriza tion bill next month, we intend to pro pose a Strategic Environmental Re search Program. This  initiative will  make use of the unique skills and tech nological capabilities of  the various  Federal  laboratories  in  the Defense  Department and  the Department of  Energy that in the past have been de voted primarily to traditional military  needs.  America's technological capability is  one of our Nation's greatest assets.  Our real peace dividend will consist of  the research talent that will be made  available  as our Defense Establish ment is reduced-thousands of highly  trained and educated scientists, engi neers, and technicians. As our defense  requirements change, we have an op portunity to redirect this tremendous  national resource toward the environ mental  challenges we  face  in  the  1990's: Understanding what we  are  doing to the environment today, clean ing up the damage we have done  in  the past, and modernizing U.S. indus tries and Government to establish and  maintain  technological  leadership  in  this critical area in the future.  Mr. President, environmental  tech nology is likely to be the growth indus try of the next 20 years. Some have re cently estimated that by the middle of  this decade 2 to 3 percent of the indus trialized nations' gross domestic prod uct would be spent cleaning up the en vironment.  The Defense  Establish ment should be at the forefront of this  technological effort for a number of  reasons: First, because environmental  deterioration  in  a  very  real  sense  threatens our Nation's security and  the security of the world; second, be cause the Defense Establishment has  unique data collection and technologi cal capabilities; and third, because the  Defense Establishment helped create  some of the environmental problems  we face today.  CHANGES IN THE THREATS TO OUR SECURITY  The world has changed dramatically  in the past year. The Berlin Wall has  fallen,  the  Iron Curtain has  been  lifted,  and  a  tide  of democracy  is  sweeping  the  globe.  These  events  should be a source of pride for every  American. We hope and pray that this  trend will continue. These events rep resent the fulfillment of national secu rity objectives laid out for America by  the leaders of our Nation at the end of  World War II, and followed by every  Democratic and Republican Adminise This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

905,1141,11,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President,  re serving the right to object,  this has  been a bit of high drama now injected  into what has been  a  very  serious  month-long determination.  No one loves humor more than I do.  But it really is not very funny.  ",1990
906,1141,11,Mr. BIDEN., I also do not think it is.  ,1990
907,1141,11,Mr.  SIMPSON.," There  is  nothing  really very funny and I admonish the  Chair to admonish the gallery not to  be involved in laughter. That is one of  our rules. We are not here to do that.  The minority leader has assigned me  yesterday to get involved in this and  try to, if we could, get something to gether.  So, being a good lieutenant for my  Captain DoLE,  I wandered  into  the  fray about 5 o'clock yesterday after noon.  Here we have the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee and the ranking  member who have worked and slaved  to put together a piece of legislation,  and done a magnificent job of it. We  also are fortunate  to have a  side of  this minority leader who has  to run  our shop and does it with extraordi nary patience, more than I could ever  muster. I was the majority leader of  the Wyoming State House of Rep resentatives. That is not exactly in the  big leagues, but the problems are ex actly the same. You have to go mash  people around, you have to take away  their toys, you have to tell them when  they can  take a nap and get  their  cookies to them at the proper break.  That is not for fun. It just gets that  absurd. They have to be at a fundrais er; they cannot be here; the plane does  not land;  they have a wedding;  they  have a  funeral; and you do all that.  The leader does all that beautifully.  So, I watched Senator BIDEN, an ex ceedingly  genial man,  with  great  wisdom and wit, working toward a goal  he has been working for for years. And  Senator THURMOND,  steady,  patient,  persistent, doggedly working for  the  same goal.  So, here we are now talking about  whether we had a deal or not. I feel a  very  great  sense  of  responsibility  there. We were putting together a deal  and  late  in  the darkening hour we  went into the majority leader's office  and had it put together,  in a  sense,  and then I realized that there was one  part of that I had left unsaid. That  was my error. That was the part that  one of the Members on our side of the  aisle said do not forget. We do not  want to have a vote on that until we  get back. That is what was said. That  was an entreaty from my side.  And the majority leader gulped and  said, ""I don't remember that."" I said,  ""No reason you should. I am express ing it to you now. It came about an  hour ago while we were in the midst of  a chaotic little exercise, and that  is  something I did not share with you.""  So he came back and placed  that  into  the unanimous-consent  request  this morning.  Senator  HATFIELD  is  a  singular  person in this Chamber. Who does not  know the intensity of his feelings on  capital  punishment  and  war  and  peace? And he is  just Senator MARK  HATFIELD as we know him, totally au thentic in what he does.  Last night he could not make any  kind  of  agreement  to  go  forward.  Today, which is his wont, he is ready  to go forward. So we do not have that  vexatious problem which would have  caused objection by Senator D' AMATO.  Now we are ready  to go forward on  capital punishment, and the Senator  from Oregon knows he will have his  day, and he should.  Then we had another Senator who  did not feel he could go forward today  with final passage. That was Senator  ARMSTRONG whose mother is very criti cally ill. He was not here. As you all  know, he is a player in this kind of ac tivity.  Senator GRAMM has to leave and will  leave regardless of what we do today,  without question. He has obligations  that he has had for a long time.  I guess what  I would  like  to  just  wind down with is that I know what  the agenda  is. We  can  reach  that  agenda during this session, I am talk ing about a civil rights bill. The Re publican leader has been off the floor,  because we are in serious negotiations  down  to  language alone which will  give us a civil rights bill we all want.  We all say we do not want quotas and  yet  the  language everybody  is using  who are  the proponents of  the bill  really does that. So now we are down  to lawyers' language and I think they  are going to get a civil rights bill that  the President will be glad to sign and  all of us will just be delighted to par ticipate in because it will be what we  all said. We do not want quotas and we  will not have them. OK, we will not.  That is what  is going on right now  today in our Chambers with the mi nority leader.  We will get a farm bill. We know we  have to do that. We will get the debt  limit. We will get the DOD authoriza tion. We have key bills in conference  and those conferences will move. We  will have clean air and all the rest of  it.  But  I  am saying  to  the majority  leader in all sincerity that we can go  forward today. I do not care who gets  the credit or who gets the blame be cause, you see,  the American people  really do not give a whit. Six months  from now they will not know who was  for taxes or who was for entitlements  reform. That is not a nasty comment;  that is because they are raising their  babies and going to work and they do  not get involved in the gyrations and  hyperbole that we do here.  I  tell you where we are. We could  not finish this in any event today. We  have first-degree amendments, nine on  each side. That is 9 hours. We could  finish it on Thursday night which we  have been told is our late night. I am  ready to do that. I am ready to wait  here until tomorrow and ready to go  Saturday.  I  think at some point  in  time the majority leader might have  to twist the crank and do this.  I would  not bat an eye if the majority leader  said, you know, ""we are going to crank  about.  We should not throw bricks at the  institution when we are all involved, I  think, in doing what he wants us to do  and all he needs to do. He is going to  do that, I feel, today, and give us the  marching order for what we are going  to do Friday and Monday. Here  is  where we are and our leader will deter mine how to go forward.  We have first-degree amendments on  each  side,  9  hours.  Second-degree  amendments, four on each side; that is  4V2 hours. We have 14 votes, 15 to 20  minutes;  that is 15 hours. It is now  11:30. We could go forward. I say this  so the record is clear. We could go for ward and move on this bill. At some  future time if there is a cloture vote, I  have a hunch that the result will not  be the same, I assure you of that, be cause nobody wants to kill the bill. All  they wanted was an opportunity  to  present their amendments.  ",1990

A TRIBUTE TO SENATOR  QUENTIN BURDICK  ",1990
912,1167,11,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I join all  of our colleagues in congratulating the  distinguished  senior  Senator  from  North Dakota, Mr. QUENTIN BURDICK,  on the celebration of the 30th anniver sary today of his election to the U.S.  Senate.  Subsequent to that election, QUEN TIN BURDICK was formally sworn into  the Senate on August 8, 1960, and on  that  day  he  began  his  illustrious  career with us.  During  the past  three decades,  I  have been privileged to count Senator  BURDICK  as  a  friend,  as well  as  a  Senate colleague. I know firsthand of  the vital contributions  that he has  made to our work in this body.  I am particularly pleased to call at tention  to Senator BURDICK's  long  years of service and his  record, be cause my  association with Senator  BURDICK predates 1960. Prior  to my  own election to the Senate, I was privi leged to serve in the House of Repre sentatives  for 6 years with Senator  BURDICK's  father,  the  Honorable  Usher L. Burdick, who represented his  area in the House of Representatives.  The Burdick family has enjoyed an  enviable number of years of service.  One notes  from his biography  that  QUENTIN BURDICK lost six elections for  political office before his being elected  to  the House of Representatives  in  1958. Since that 1958 election, the citi zens  of North Dakota have  recon firmed  their  confidence  in Senator  QUENTIN BURDICK six more times, be ginning with his special Senate elec tion victory on June 28, 1960.  That long record of electoral strug gles and victories is testimony to both  QUENTIN BURDICK's courage and his te nacity, and to the depth of conviction  that has earned him a distinction as  being among only 1 of 36 Senators  who will have, as of August 8  this  year, reached the 30-year mark out of  1,793 men and women who have served  in the Senate since 1789.  Currently, Senator BURDICK  serves  as chairman of  the Senate Environ ment and Public Works Committee,  the first Senate committee chairman  from North Dakota since the 83d Con gress. Coupled with his chairmanship  of  the Appropriations Subcommittee  SENATOR QUENTIN BURDICK  ",1990
913,1167,11,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  would like to take this opportunity to  honor one of our colleagues. QUENTIN  N. BURDICK has served North Dakota  in  the Senate with quiet distinction  for the last 30 years and as one of his  slogans states, has truly carried ""Clout  for North Dakota."" We are all familiar  with QUENTIN'S leadership on the En vironment and Public Works Commit tee and his deep commitment to the  people of North Dakota.  I can be especially grateful that I  can count QUENTIN BURDICK  among  my colleagues-not only for his contri butions  to  this body-but pleased  to  find another Member who shares my  taste in vintage Cadillacs. QUENTIN has  long been a friend of Alaska and has  seen the State grow. He has voted on  almost every piece of major legislation  that has affected Alaska except  for  the land purchase of 1867, the Territo rial Act of 1912.  He has also seen the Nation grow  and has helped define  its course. In  QUENTIN'S 30 years here he has seen  the assassination of a President, the  enactment of major social legislation,  and has been among the leadership of  the Nation as they guided us through  some of the country's most turbulent  times since WWII.  Through QUENTIN  and his  father,  the Burdick name has long been asso ciated with  good  politics  in North  Dakota. QUENTIN has carried on  the  proud  tradition  of North Dakota's  elected politics and has been instru mental  in developing  the shape and  flavor of the U.S. Senate.  I have been privileged to work with  Senator BURDICK on projects  impor tant to Alaska in his role as chairman  of the Environment and Public Works  Committee and as a member of  the  Select Committee on Indian Affairs.  My wife Nancy  joins me  in wishing  both QUENTIN and Jocelyn congratula tions on not only his 30th anniversary  of Senate service but on his family's  over half century of service to North  Dakota and Congress.  TRIBUTE TO VERA WARREN  ",1990
914,1167,11,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to a dear friend  and perennial member of my staff,  Vera Warren. After 11 years of dedicated service in my Washington office,  Vera will be leaving the Senate to go  back home again to Indiana.  Vera has a  long history of public  service to Hoosiers, dating back to my  first  term as mayor of Indianapolis.  She ran for and was elected as a local  precinct committeewoman. Vera went  on to become a  founding member of  the Indiana Black Republican Council,  an active member of the State Repub lican Party,  and was  awarded  the  State's highest civic honor, the ""Saga more of the Wabash."" Then-Governor  Otis Bowen bestowed this award upon  Vera  for distinguished achievements  in service to the citizens of Indianapo lis.  Vera came  to Washington,  joining  my personal staff early in my Senate  career. She has fulfilled a number of  roles in my office including those of  bookkeeper,  receptionist,  legislative  secretary, and assistant to my legisla tive director. Vera's significant contri butions to Hoosiers transcend any de scription associated with a title.  While becoming something of an in stitution in the Lugar office, Vera also  managed to raise five daughters and is  currently the proud grandmother of  11,  and  great-grandmother  to  the  newest addition to the Warren family,  Anthony Evans. As a grandfather,  I  can appreciate  this truly remarkable  achievement.  Although Vera will be sorely missed,  we are excited about the new opportu nities which lie ahead for her. I wish  her the best in all that she endeavors  to do.  COMMENDATION FOR SENATOR  PELL'S WORK  TO  PROTECT  THE ENVIRONMENT  ",1990
915,1167,11,Mr. GORE.," Mr. President, I would  like to draw my colleagues' attention  to an important Op-Ed in last Friday's  Christian Science Monitor by my good  friend and colleague Senator PELL. For  years, CLAIBORNE PELL has been at the  forefront of international environmen tal protection efforts. He has compiled  an impressive record of legislative ac complishments in this area, from his  early work in the field of protecting  biological  diversity  to  this  forward  thinking proposals for financing inter national environmental protection. In  this  light, Senator PELL's  comments  about  the  administration's environ mental policy formulation process de serve close attention.

936,1232,11,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  rise in strong support of my colleague  from Minnesota's amendment. In fact,  this amendment is identical to title 1  of S. 1825, which I  introduced. This  amendment serves an important objec tive-to ensure that those who kidnap  children and harm them are appropri ately punished.  Mr. President, vicious, heinous acts  similar to those described by my col league are committed every day in this  Nation. The American people are tired  of seeing innocent children snatched  from  their homes, abused, exploited,  and, all too often, never seen or heard  from again. Congress must do every thing it can to ensure that those who  prey upon our children are never given  the opportunity to do so again.  This amendment will enhance  the  penalties for  those who kidnap chil dren. Anyone who does so will face a  mandatory minimum prison senatence  of 30 years imprisonment. If the per petrator abuses, seriously  injures, or  sexually exploits that child, he will be  sentenced to life imprisonment.  Mr. President,  I  can  think of no  crime more deserving of these serious  penalties. Anyone who preys upon our  children should not be dealt with in a  lenient  manner.  Tough  penalties  which will serve as a deterrent, and  which will appropriately punish those  who would choose  to take the inno cence away from our children, are es sential.  For  these  reasons,  I  support  this  amendment and strongly urge my col leagues to support it as well.  ",1990

951,1232,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  proponents have 15 minutes.  Mr. DOMENIC!.  I  yield myself 5  minutes.  Mr. President, there is going to be a  lot of discussion here on this Inouye Domenici amendment that we are ex empting the Indian people from the  death penalty. Right up front, I want  to suggest that we are not. We have in  existence  in  the United States  of  America a  firm policy called  Indian  self-determination. From that Indian  self-determination comes Indian gov erning bodies. They have  their own  government bodies,  just  like States  have  theirs, and all we are doing in  this amendment is saying that all of  the Federal offenses such as the kill ing or attempting to kill a President,  that one carries the death penalty, if  it occurs  in Indian country, or  if  it  occurs  in  the State of Missouri, or  State of Hawaii, or New Mexico, car ries the death penalty under this bill.  Treason, on an Indian reservation, an  Indian  pueblo  in New Mexico,  or  Navaho Nation, carries the death pen alty. Espionage, hijacking, kidnaping,  all of those will continue to retain the  death penalty, as provided in this bill.  All  the  amendment  says  is  for  murder, an Indian shoots an Indian, or  an  Indian kills a non-Indian on an  Indian  reservation, we are going  to  treat Indian reservations just like we  are going to treat States. If there is in  effect the death penalty in that reser vation,  in that pueblo,  in that tribe,  then the death penalty will apply.  We, in effect, say to the Indian gov erning bodies of  this country: ""You  have  the  opportunity  to  pass  the  death penalty, and if you pass it, then  murder occurring on an Indian reser vation, tribe, or pueblo will be punish able in the Federal courts by death.""  ",1990
952,1245,11,Mr.  GRASSLEY.," Mr.  President,  much of  this crime bill debate has  been about convicted criminals-their  rights of collateral appeals, for exam ple, and whether they can be constitu tionally put to death by the State for  their crimes.  Other parts of the debate have fo cused on other substantive and proce dural rights of criminal defendants.  This amendment, Mr. President,  different.  It focuses not on the perpetrators of  crime, but rather the victims of crime.  This amendment  is  the product of  independent work on my part, and on  the  part  of my  distinguished  col league, Senator NICKLES. I am pleased  that we have been able to join forces  on this amendment to the crime bill to  provide the only occasion the Senate  will have to support the rights of vic tims.  Our amendment establishes:  is  First, a bill of rights for the victims  of crime;  Second, services  to be provided  to  crime victims, once they have entered  the criminal justice system;  Third, improved means of providing  restitution to the victim of a crime;  Fourth, reversal of a recent Supreme  Court decision  that would allow de crees of bankruptcy  to discharge  a  valid order for restitution on the part  of a convicted criminal; and  Fifth, procedural rights for victims  to have  input  in a  distinct written  statement during the sentencing phase  of a Federal capital case.  Mr. President, we all work in what  has been called the murder capital of  the world-a place where crime scenes  are as commonplace as the neighbor hood ice cream truck on a June after noon.  As  the victims of violent crime  in crease  in  number,  our  senses  get  dulled. We necessarily lose our capac ity to feel any emotion for the pain  that the bloodshed causes victims and  their survivors.  Ironically, as the crimes grow more  outrageous, we are losing our ability to  be outraged, on behalf of crime's vic tims, and society.  In 1982, Congress enacted the Victim  and Witness Protection Act [VWPAJ  to try to address the rights of crime  victims.  This statute is well-intended, and I  was pleased to support it. But it needs  to be beefed up.  Under current law, the crime victim  does not have the right to communi cate his or her views distinctly to the  sentencing judge in Federal cases.  Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure  No. 32(c) provides only that a presen tence  report  be  prepared. Among  other things, the report, which is pre pared by court-appointed officers,  is  supposed to contain:  Information concerning any harm, includ ing  financial,  social,  psychological,  and  physical harm, done to or loss suffered by  any victim of the offense, and any other in formation  that may aid the court  in sen tencing,  including the restitution needs of  any victim of the offense.  Various States, on the other hand,  provide victims with the opportunity  to communicate to the court through  a ""victim  impact statement""  in non capital cases.  My portion of the Grassley /Nickles  amendment would apply this essential  rule,  in a more direct, distinct, and  formal procedure,  in Federal capital  cases.  No doubt, it will be argued that this  amendment is unconstitutional.  In 1987, by a bare 5-to-4 majority in  Booth versus Maryland, the Supreme  Court  determined  that  the  eighth  amendment prohibited a  jury  from  considering such a victim impact state ment during the sentencing phase of a  State capital trial.  But as has been often observed, ""the  Constitution is what five members of  the Court say it is.""  This opinion was written by Justice  Powell, who is no longer on the Court.  The question  is a very close one.  Other members of  the Court have  strongly urged reconsideration. This is  the Senate's way to take up the Su preme Court's offer to reconsider.  I  believe  that  a  distinct  victim  impact  statement-a  truthful  state ment on the loss of the victim and the  impact of  that  loss on  the victim's  family-can be presented to the trier  of fact during the sentencing phase of  the  proceeding without violating  a  convicted  defendant's  constitutional  due process safeguards.  Allow me  to describe  for my col leagues the circumstances surrounding  the deaths of the victims in the Booth  case.  I believe it will explain why I am  proposing this amendment, why I be lieve the Court ought to take another  look at this issue.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND  Mr. President, in 1983, Irvin Bron stein, aged 78, and his wife Rose, aged  75, were robbed  in  their west Balti more home.  The murderers,  John Booth  and  Willie Reid, entered the victims' home  for the apparent purpose of stealing  money to buy heroin.  Booth, a neighbor of the Bronsteins,  knew  that the couple could identify  him. So,  the Bronsteins were bound  and gagged and stabbed repeatedly in  their chests with a kitchen knife.  The Bronsteins' son discovered the  bodies of his parents 2 days later.  A Maryland jury found Booth guilty  of two counts of first-degree murder,  two counts of robbery, and conspiracy  to commit robbery.  The prosecution requested the death  penalty and Booth elected to have his  sentence  determined  by  the  jury  rather than the judge.  Before  the  sentencing  phase  of  Booth's prosecution began, the Mary land State Division of Parole and Pro bation compiled a presentence report  that  described Booth's background,  education,  employment history,  and  criminal record.  At that time, Maryland law also re quired  a  victim  impact  statement  [VISJ be considered during this phase  of the criminal proceedings.  The VIS was  intended  to describe  the effect of the crime on the victim  and his family. Compiled by the State,  the VIS  information was  to be sup plied by  the victim or his or her  family.  The VIS could be read to the jury  during  the sentencing phase or  the  victim's  family members  could  be  called to testify as to the information  contained in the VIS.  ",1990
953,1258,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Florida.  ,1990
954,1258,11,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr.  President,  I  strongly  oppose  the  second-degree  amendment which essentially eviscer ates  the concept of this amendment  and  substantially negates  the argu ments that many of us made when we  were discussing the Racial Justice Act.  The Racial Justice Act, as you recall,  Mr. President, was a provision in the  original crime bill  that would have  said if a State had a statistical imbal ance as between the composition of its  population or various components of  its population and those to whom the  criminal  laws were applied, and par ticularly the death penalty, then the  States assumed the burden of showing  that they did not have a racially dis criminatory  criminal  justice  system  and would be precluded from utilizing  the death penalty until they had over come that presumption.  Mr. President,  the argument  that  many of us made was  that the Su preme Court has said that there is no  constitutional right to have any par ticular statistical outcome of your jus tice system, that our justice system is  predicated on  individual  justice and  that constitutional  rights are  those  things that relate  to your  individual  status, and there must be a showing of  discrimination in the specific case of  the defendant before the bar.  The whole purpose of this proposal  is to allow for a broad examination of  the justice system, not a narrow exam ination, as the chief justice of Florida  has stated when such a  commission  was established in my State, to look at  issues from the question of are we pre paring a sufficient number and proper ly prepared, trained lawyers that are  representative of  the population of  the State so that they can be available  to the justice system; are we training  persons to work in our justice system  in ways that will give us some assur ance that invidious but not necessarily  unconstitutional  racial  and  ethnic  practices are not being used to distort  the justice system.  It is  important, Mr. President, not  only that the substance of the justice  system be upheld but the constitution al standard be maintained. It is also  important, Mr. President,  that  the  perception, the perception, the view of  justice by the average American man  and woman be  that  this  is  a  fair  system. It is  to that goal that these  studies are directed.  Also these studies are not limited to  the specifics of an individual or class  of criminal defendant. They are  in tended to  look broadly, systemically,  at the process of  the  justice system  within our State.  As I indicated, Mr. President, this is  not a novel idea. States as diverse as  Florida, New Jersey, New York, Massa chusetts, and others have adopted a  proposal to initiate similar studies.  The Senator  from Utah  suggests  that these are going to be out-of-con trol commissions,  that  they will be  turned into sociological laboratories. If  we read the proposal, the amendment  says that these panels have to be es tablished  by  one  of  three  groups,  either  the highest court within  the  State, or by  the  legislature of  the  State, or by the Governor of the State.  None of  those  three convening au thorities is exactly likely to lose con trol of what is expected.  Second, I would point out that it is  up  to  the U.S. Attorney General  to  pass  judgement on  specific  applica tions for these grant funds. So a  re sponsible constitutional body within  the State must initiate, and the high est justice officer in the U.S. Govern ment must  approve  and  allocate,  before  these panels  to  study  racial  issues within a State's justice system,  so they can be funded and can move  forward, at least with Federal funds.  The States that have already initiat ed these studies have done so because  they felt it was in their State's inter est, sufficiently in their interest, that  they would  initiate  and  fund with  their State dollars. I believe this is an  appropriate area for the Federal Gov ernment to further encourage States  to  look  seriously  at  their  justice  system, and with that examination to  take such steps as that State considers  to be appropriate.  I believe and I do not feel I would  have any disagreement with either the  Senator from Utah or South Carolina,  that  this  is  a more appropriate  re sponse  than  the attempt  to convert  our justice system into a mathematical  system, which was the essence of the  original title I of S. 1970.  Mr. President, I  therefore strongly  urge  the defeat of  this amendment,  which would significantly undermine  the very purpose for which this pro posal is made: to encourage a serious  examination of the system of justice  within the State, and through that ex amination to give reassurance to the  public that justice for all is,  in fact,  not only an objective, but a  reality  within that State's justice system.  ",1990
955,1258,11,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I would  like to ask how the Senator from Flor ida can be against my amendment. It  just says we are  limiting studies  to  constitutional rights. What rights are  enforced by the Senator's amendment  if they are not constitutional rights?  The States are free  to grant greater  and more  liberal rights to criminals,  but I do not see why we in the Con gress have to fund their efforts to do  so. I think we should enforce the Con stitution, not fund the efforts of those  who would change the basic consitu tional law.  I do not understand how anyone can  be against this particular amendment.  First of all, if you see the purpose of  the Graham amendment as being the  protection  of  constitutional  rights,  then you cannot object to this amend ment stating that. But if you see the  Graham  amendment  as  advancing  some other agenda,  then  I  suppose  maybe you should oppose my amend ment.  If you want to arm convicted crimi nals with new, ingenious arguments to  overturn their sentences, particularly  their  death  sentences,  then  vote  against my amendment. Those who  are against the death penalty should  vote against this amendment because  what the distinguished Senator from  Florida is trying to do is bring through  the back door the Racial Justice Act  that was soundly defeated on the floor  of the Senate.  Everybody knows the whole purpose  of that act is to eviscerate capital pun ishment and do  away with  it. The  whole purpose of the proposed studies  is to do exactly the same thing.  So if you want to arm criminals with  new, ingenious arguments to overturn  their  sentences,  particularly  their  death sentences, then vote against my  amendment,  because  if my  amend ment passes, there will be no question  that the funds authorized by this bill  will not be available for that particu lar purpose.  But if you  think that the Federal  Government should not be in the busi ness of funding research for the pur pose of aiding criminals in making ar guments  that do not even relate  to  their constitutional rights, as broad as  those are, then I urge you to vote for  my amendment, because that is what  the issue is.  The Graham-Lieberman amendment  will, if unamended by my amendment,  fund efforts  to change  the  law. We  should instead be funding efforts  to  enforce the law. That is really the es sence of the debate.  I  find no fault  with  the distinguished Senator from  Florida in wanting to do that. But do  not let anybody be mistaken on this  thing. If you do not have my amend ment added to it, then you are funding  efforts to really change the law rather  than enforce the law. I think there is  no question about it.  What I want to do here is to guaran tee  that  these  studies  required or  funded by the amendment of the dis tinguished Senator  from Florida  to  this bill will be limited to the question  of whether the constitutional rights of  criminal defendants have been violat ed. Therefore, extra legal matters will  be precluded.  We ought to limit these studies to  legal issues, not sociological matters so  the studies funded by this bill will not  be used  for  improper political pur poses. If we do not amend the distin",1990
956,1310,11,Mr.  LEVIN.," Mr.  President,  this  amendment  is very  straightforward.  Under current law, as interpreted by  the Supreme Court  a month  ago,  someone who is convicted of a criminal  offense-or who pleads guilty  to  a  criminal offense-and who  is ordered  to pay restitution as part of his or her  sentence can avoid that obligation en tirely by filing for bankruptcy under  chapter 13 of the Federal Bankruptcy  Code. That's all there is to it: File for  bankruptcy and your obligation to pay  for a criminal violation is wiped out.  I  think that is wrong. I  think that  restitution is an important part of the  arsenal of sanctions we have in sen tencing criminals and that it is par ticularly appropriate when the under lying crime involves financial fraud or  wrongdoing. It just should not be that  easy to avoid. Back in 1978, a House  report on the Bankruptcy Code stated,  ""The bankruptcy laws are not a haven  for criminal offenders."" I believe Con gress shares that view today.  Right now, there is a discrepancy in  the bankruptcy law. A few years ago,  the Supreme Court rules that crimi nals could not avoid their restitution  debts under chapter 7 of  the Bank ruptcy Code. <Kelley v. Robinson, 479  U.S. 36 0986).) About a month ago,  however,  the Court came down  the  other way under chapter 13 of  the  Bankruptcy Code. <Pennsylvania De partment of Public Welfare v. Davenport, No. 89-156 <May 29, 1990).) Now,  for those of us who are not bankrupt cy experts, the fundamental difference  between chapter 7 and chapter 13  is  that chapter 7 calls for liquidation of a  debtor's estate while chapter 13 calls  for reorganization. That distinction is  meaningless when it comes to treating  restitution obligations resulting from  criminal convictions.  The Supreme Court's recent Daven port decision was decided 7 to 2. It in volved a couple in Pennsylvania who  pleaded guilty  to welfare fraud and  were sentenced to 1 year's probation.  As a condition of probation, the Dav enports were ordered to make monthly  restitution payments to the State. In stead of making  those court-ordered  payments,  the Davenports  filed  for  bankruptcy under chapter 13. And the  Supreme Court interpreted the Bank ruptcy Code as condoning that maneu ver as a way around their restitution  obligation. The majority of the Court  did not say that it was good policy or  constitutionally required that restitu tion debts be excused in these circum stances. It said, based on it's reading  of the statute, that is what Congress  meant  in  drafting  the Bankruptcy  Code.  Well, I do not think that's what we  meant or want. I think that the minor ity had  it  right.  Justice Blackmun  wrote, and I agree, that:  ""The statutory  language,  the consistent  authority  treating  criminal  sanctions  as  nondischargeable under the Bankruptcy Act  of 1989, the absence of any legislative histo ry suggesting that the code was intended to  change that established principle, and the  strong policy of deference to State criminal  judgments all compel the conclusion that a  restitution order is not a dischargeable debt.  Justice Blackmun also wrote for the  minority that:  <T>here is no indication that Congress had  any intent so drastically to change the es tablished pre-Code practice regarding crimi nal sanctions.  The Supreme Court has spoken on  what it thinks Congress meant. Now  let us speak and say what we  really  mean. Let us fix the Bankruptcy Code  so that it is unambiguous. Let us make  clear that criminals cannot evade their  restitution obligations by  filing  for  bankruptcy, under any section of the  Bankruptcy Code. That is what this  amendment does.  Mr.  President,  I  understand  that  this amendment is acceptable to the  managers of the bill.  ",1990

960,1310,11,Mr. BIDEN.," Yes, I yield back all my  time.  am happy  to yield  I  Senator JOHN F. KERRY,  Senate Office Building,  Washington, DC.  DEAR SENATOR KERRY: The need by the na tions law enforcement community for direct  financial support from  federal funding  to  help reduce crime is critical. Your amend ment that would require the much needed  funds back up a poll that we have just com pleted of every chief and sheriff of  this  nation.  We asked if the departments were under manned and 90% responded that they did  not have the people to fight the criminals  that have made our streets unsafe. It is a  fact that crime for the past ten years has in creased more than 30% while actual police  manpower has been reduced.  Few, if any departments get any federal  assistance in dollars that they can spend on  equipment, added men, reserves, or even re placement vehicles.  In 1960 we lost one police officer a week in  the line of duty. Today we see a bulletin  that lists an officer dead every 57 hours.  Many of those deaths could be reduced with  funding for bullet resistant vests, for  the  weapons and training they need. For more  officers on the street.  We pray to God that your fellow members  of the Senate will support your amendment  to increase the direct aid to the thin-blue  line.  Sincerely,  GERALD S. ARENBERG,  Executive Director.

965,1388,11,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce legislation on a sub ject of much concern to me as chair man of  the Subcommittee on Chil dren, Family, Drugs, and Alcoholism.  The plight of children who are inno cent victims of substance abuse draws  from us many emotions, from deepest  pity  to sharpest anger. It challenges  our ability and commitment to reach  out to even the most troubled parents.  I strongly believe, however, that our  success in responding to the problem  will be measured more by our compas sion than our condemnation. Accord ingly, I am introducing the Children  of Substance Abusers Act  of  1990  which  is based on the principle that  extending help  early  and providing  comprehensive health and social serv ices is the best way to protect children  and preserve families.  I won't recite all the statistics about  drug-exposed  infants. But  testimony  from my hearings suggests staggering  costs to society-as much as $20 billion  for infants born exposed to cocaine in  just 1 year. In the neonatal intensive  care unit at New York City's Metro politan Hospital, which  I visited, 30  percent of the children are drug-ex posed. In my own State of Connecti cut, a study at Yale-New Haven Hospital found that 19 percent of women  giving birth used illegal drugs within  48 hours of delivery. We are only be ginning  to glimpse what  the future  holds for these children. Research sug gests a cluster of subtle developmental  problems. Head Start  teachers  say  they already are seeing a pattern of  behaviors  including  short  attention  spans, delayed speech, and combative  or exaggerated behavior that can be  traced to drug exposure.  The  impact of substance abuse on  children extends far beyond drug-ex posed infants. The National Commit tee for the Prevention of Child Abuse  estimates that 675,000 children annu ally are seriously mistreated by a care taker who is a substance abuser. The  abuse  these  children  experience  is  more severe and the neglect more com plete than anything seen in the past.  Mr. President, some weeks ago I was  astonished to hear a news report that  the Director of the Office of National  Drug Control Policy, Mr. Bennett, sug gested  removing  children  in  drug plagued homes and neighborhoods and  placing them in orphanages. I was as tonished because so far our response  has been  to  remove  these  children  from their homes. Child welfare pro fessionals will be the first to say this  isn't the answer. But drug and alcohol  treatment services tailored to women  and children are in short supply. We  all recognize that, sadly, some children  must be  removed from  their homes.  But it is tragic when children must be  removed because we as a society are  unwilling to invest in certain families,  writing them off as unworthy of our  support.  The Children of Substance Abusers  Act of 1990 will begin to make that in vestment. The heart of the bill  is a  children  of  substance  abusers,  or  COSA, program  that would provide  $100 million for comprehensive serv ices  to  children and  their  families.  This bill is unique in its extension of  help beyond the prenatal period and  its  inclusion of any child of a  sub stance abuser. It thus provides a con tinum of health and  social  services  ranging from parenting education  to  pediatric care. A primary goal of the  COSA program is to preserve families,  but children cared  for by  relatives,  foster parents, and adoptive parents  also are included.  We cannot wait, however,  to reach  out  to  high-risk  families  until  an  infant is born addicted, or a  toddler  doesn't get his  immunizations, or a  mother abandons her child. We have  to  intervene early. Thus,  the COSA  bill incudes a $50 million home visiting  program to provide outreach to preg nant women. Home visitors provide  help ranging from information on par enting  and  child  development  to  simply giving support and encourage ment. These programs have repeatedly  ",1990

SOPRIS TREE NURSERY LAND  EXCHANGE  ..,  HON. BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL  OF COLORADO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 28, 1990  ",1990
973,1518,11,Mr. CAMPBELL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I am  introducing  legislation  to allow  Pitkin and Eagle Counties to acquire an 186  tree nursery in the White River National Forest  in exchange for roughly 1,344 acres of patent ed mining claims which are owned by  the  counties.  The  tree  farm has been  targeted  for ex change, transfer or sale by the General Serv ices  Administration  [GSA].  The  counties  intend to use the tree farm to develop recre ational facilities,  for open space, and to build  a senior center. This exchange also protects  the property from  future private development  because  it contains a clause which directs  that all  the proceeds from any sale or lease  would go to the United States.  As you know,  the ski areas of Vail, Beaver  Creek, and Aspen are world  reknown. This  recognition has not been without cost. A tre mendous amount of stress has been placed  on  local facilities and property values are ski  high. The county needs land to fulfill responsi bilities  that  local governments have, but are  often overlooked by the public.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The bill also sets up an orderly process to  address any claims which may arise when the  United States is granted title to the patented  mining claims. This  is necessary  to prevent  any  further  forest management  problems  which could arise.  The Forest Service and  the counties have  been attempting  to complete  this exchange  administratively for many years. Unfortunately,  the cost of clearing the title on every acre of  property makes this  infeasible  in  light of the  stressed Forest Service and county budgets.  This exchange will  serve  a valuable public  purpose-and save the Government money.  MEDICAL  INSURANCE  SAFETY  NET MISSING  FOR MILLIONS  OF CITIZENS  HON. SAM GEJDENSON  OF CONNECTICUT  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 28, 1990  ",1990
974,1518,11,Mr. GEJDENSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I am sure  that my colleagues are well aware of the vast  number of  individuals-the poor,  the unem ployed, the working uninsured, and in fact, the  many children-who are without health insur ance coverage. Currently, an estimated 32 to  37 million  individuals  live on  a day-to-day  basis without  a medical  safety  net. They  cannot afford visits to the family doctor, have  no access  to preventive care, no means  to  obtain prenatal  care, and no protection  in  case of a medical emergency. Several worthy  proposals have already been  introduced by  Members of this body which seek to address  the problems of the uninsured.  Mr. Speaker,  legislators and other  individuals  in  the State of Connecticut have also  grappled with  this difficult issue. On May 17,  1990, Gov. William O'Neill approved a  farreaching  plan  to make  health  insurance  cheaper and more accessible  to  the unin sured. As many as 37 disparate groups of in dividuals were  involved in  the drafting of this  legislation, ranging  from citizen-action groups  to insurance industry representatives.  The new law will extend health coverage to  an additional 60,000 Connecticut representa tives, at a cost of $2 million. This is a signifi cant step  toward a  resolution of  the health  access crisis on a State level. I would first like  to commend my colleagues in Connecticut for  all of their efforts in this area. As well, I would  encourage legislators from other States and at  Federal level to give this legislation close con sideration:  AN ACT CONCERNING THE RECOMMENDATIONS  OF THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON STATE  HEALTH INSURANCE  Summary: This bill expands access to and  increases  the  availability of health  care  services and  insurance coverage  to people  currently without health insurance or with  inadequate coverage. It allows expansion of  Medicaid, within available appropriations,  to serve more children, pregnant women, el derly, and disabled people. It also requires  granting presumptive eligibility to pregnant  women applying for Medicaid. The bill ex pands a current Medicaid waiver program  assisting disabled children and adults.  also allows for a Medicaid ""buy-out,"" within  available funds, to encourage Medicaid-eligiIt  June 28, 1990  accept  employment-based  ble  people  to  health coverage.  The bill allows the Department of Health  Services [DOHSl, based on available fund ing,  to contract with  insurers  to develop  both subsidized nongroup health insurance  for children and pregnant women, and in surance for people with disabilities.   DOHS can establish, again based on avail able  funding, a grant program  to expand  access to primary care services.  The  bill  requires  creation  of  ""special  health care plans"" offered by health insur ers and health care centers-HMO's-for a  limited time to small employers who are not  currently offering their employees any cov erage. It is also available to individuals. Spe cial health care plans must be available to  certain low-income individuals through the  existing Health Reinsurance Association  [ERAl.  The bill includes a number of small group  market reforms designed to increase afford ability  and  accessibility  of  insurance  through  creation of  a  reinsurance  pool,  limits on premiums  that can be charged,  limits  on  use  of  pre-existing  condition  clauses, disclosure of specified rating prac tices, and other measures.  Under the bill, the Commission on Hospi tals and Health Care [CHHCl must address  Medicare cost shifting and improvements in  its data gathering.  Finally, the bill creates a Health Access  Commission within  the  legislative branch  charged with monitoring the programs to be  developed under the bill and their effect on  addressing trhe uninsured population.

LUKEN  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 28, 1990  ",1990
977,1544,11,Mr.  THOMAS  A.  LUKEN.," Mr.  Speaker,  today  I am  introducing legislation to give the  Environmental Protection Agency  [EPA]  the  same authority  to  regulate  tobacco products  that it has to protect all of us from other dan gerous products.  In 1976, Congress passed  the Toxic Sub stances Control Act [TSCA], which gives EPA  authority to regulate chemical substances and  mixtures which present an unreasonable risk  of injury to health or the environment. At that  time  there was  little scientific evidence  that  cigarette  smoke  caused  death  and  illness  among nonsmokers, and Congress excluded  tobacco products from coverage under TSCA.  However, in 1986 the surgeon general con cluded  that cigarette smoke caused a sub stantial number of lung cancer deaths among  nonsmokers, and the following year Congress  banned for 2 years smoking on all scheduled  domestic airline flights of 2 hours or less. Last  year Congress approved a permanent ban on  smoking on almost all  scheduled domestic  flights.  EPA has now  issued a draft report which  concludes  that about 3,800 nonsmokers die  annually from  lung cancer as a result of sec ondhand  tobacco smoke. But, under current  law, EPA can do nothing about this dangerous  product.  The Equal Treatment for Cigarettes Act re peals the tobacco exemption in TSCA. There  is no  reason why  the  tobacco  companies  should continue to be shielded from a law that  regulates all other chemical substances and  mixtures.  Mr. Speaker, this bill has bipartisan support.  Mr. WHITTAKER,  the  ranking Republican on  our subcommittee,  is an original cosponsor.  Other original cosponsors include Mr. DURBIN,  Mr. MRAZEK, Mr. ATKINS, Mr. CHANDLER, Mr.  WYDEN, Mr. WAXMAN, and ",1990
978,1544,11,Mrs. COLLINS.,"  I  urge my colleagues  to  join with us  in giving  EPA  the power to  treat cigarettes  like other  products.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask  that a  letter  from  the  American Heart Association,  the American  Cancer Society, and the American Lung Asso ciation endorsing  this bill be  included at this  point.  ... ~ -- ---.L..1 ........

979,1557,11,Mr. ERDREICH.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing a joint resolution designating April 7  through April 13, 1991, as  ""National County  Government Week.""  County government has become increasing ly  important in most States as a provider of  areawide and local municipal services. In addi tion to running  the jails, the courts,  the elec tions, and collecting the taxes, counties have  become the governments of last resort in pro viding services  for  the poor,  the homeless,  and disadvantaged citizens. My home district  of Jefferson County  is a perfect example of  what  is happening all over  the  country  in  terms of the services provided by county gov ernments.  In 1982,  the budget was around  $100 million. It is now $220 million, $40 million  of which is devoted to providing health care to  low-income patients of the county hospital.  In  promoting  greater  economic  develop ment, Jefferson County has  joined with  the  city of Birmingham and other municipalities to  help existing businesses and  to attract new  ventures. The city of Birmingham and Jeffer son County together built a civic center and a  flagship hotel. The county has also been  in strumental in developing a new research park  and also provides  low-interest loans to small  businesses thus helping to create jobs.  What  is happening  in my home county  is  happening all over the country. The phenome nal growth in services provided by counties is  evidenced by  the corresponding  increase  in  county expenditures. Counties spent almost  $103 billion  last year compared  to only $13  billion  in  1970.  Likewise,  over  1.9 million  people are now employed  in county govern ment nationwide. Certainly, each of you has  felt  the growing  influence of county govern ment in your district.  I am sure you are aware  that many Mem bers of Congress served  in county govern ment at one time in  their careers.  In fact, 74  Representatives are  former county officials.  Another 13 Senators also served  in county  government. I myself served for 8 years as a  county commissioner in Jefferson County, AL,  and have witnessed the dedication and eff ec tiveness of those who work in county govern ment.  In  light of  the  tremendous  contributions  made by county governments nationwide,  I  believe  it  is appropriate  that we designate  April 7 through April 13 as ""National County  Government Week.""  I urge my colleagues to  support this joint resolution.  16631  THE BUSH PLAN FOR LATIN  AMERICA  HON. JOHN J. LaFALCE  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 28, 1990  ",1990
980,1557,11,Mr.  LAFALCE.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  yesterday,  President Bush made an  important contribu tion  to  the  future  prospects  for economic  growth in Latin America through new propos als for increased U.S.  trade,  investment, and  debt relief.  I want  to particularly commend  the Presi dent  for  including,  for  the  first  time, official  debt relief and an increased role for the Inter American Development Bank as important in gredients in his plan.  While  it has been overshadowed by  the  more dramatic changes  in Central Europe,  many nations of Central and South America  have made significant advances  in  reforming  of  their economies as well as political sys tems. Like  the  former Soviet satellites, many  of  these Latin nations have  recently  shed  themselves  of  totalitarian  governments  in  favor of democracies. Now, they are liberaliz ing  trade, privatizing state-owned enterprises,  and taking the tough steps necessary to tame  inflation and  capital  flight. Of course,  their  problems are severe and deeply rooted, and  no government will be able to turn its nation's  economy around overnight.  Nonetheless, as  these nations make  the  necessary domestic changes, many are still  being crushed by a huge burden of debt both  commercial and official. This stubbon  problem  forces  these nations  to send hard earned foreign currency abroad in the form of  debt and debt service payments, instead of in vesting  in needed  technology,  infrastructure  improvements, education, and .other important  purposes.  It became clear to many of us  in the Con gress several years ago  that we could not  expect a turnaround in  this region until these  nations were given substantial and meaningful  debt relief, tied to economic reforms.  As a result, we have urged the President to  take a lead role in developing a framework in  which  commercial  banks would  offer debt  relief, while  securing  the  remaining  claims.  Last March, the administration responded with  the Brady plan to try to achieve this goal.  Since then, three commercial debt workouts  have been negotiated. We are hopeful  that  the amount of debt relief provided will be ade quate to help restore economic growth.  Debt  relief can  take many  forms.  I have  been  interested for some time in  the idea of  debt-for-environment  swaps  in which  debt  could be paid  in  local currency which would  then be devoted  to conservation or environ mental cleanup. I have offered such a propos al as part of  the  legislation authorizing U.S.  participation  in  the new European Bank  for  Reconstruction and Development. The new  bank should work  together with  the World  Bank and IDB to make such swaps routine in  Central Europe, Latin America, and elsewhere.  Now,  the President has gone  further. He  has offered to negotiate forgiveness of debts  these countries owe to the U.S. Government.  ",1990

982,22,16,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, very briefly, yester day we did celebrate the 25th anniver sary of  the enactment of  the 1965  voting rights bill. I happened to be one  of those 31 or 32 Members who cur rently are serving in the House who  was privileged to vote for that legisla tion at the time.  One year earlier we had several days  of extended debate on the Civil Rights  Act of 1964. As a matter of fact,  I  think it stretched nearly a week. It  was indeed a rather extensive debate.  Over in the other body my late depart ed mentor,  the late Senator Everett  McKinley Dirksen, was very visible in  that debate, on the other side, as was  Hubert Humphrey, the distinguished  Senator from Minnesota. Here in the  House  I  recall Mannie Celler  from  New York on that side of the aisle,  and Bill McCulloch from Ohio on this  side of the aisle during the delibera tions of that momentous civil rights  legislation. I was proud to vote for it.  As a matter of fact, my first vote for  civil rights in this House was to establish the Civil Rights Commission back  in 1957, and then a  significant civil  rights bill, I believe, in 1960.  In all of  these cases  there was a  truly bipartisan effort to reach con sensus. We worked together on both  sides of the aisle to get a good bill, and  Members will  recall particularly on  the majority  side where  there was  marked division back  in  those days  whenever we got to talking about civil  rights  legislation.  It was  absolutely  necessary, fundamental, to have both  parties and both  sides of  the aisle  working  together to get a good bill,  and I mention all of this because we  should be doing the same here today.  But a  restricted rule and a  reluc tance on the part of the majority to  permit one of your own to lend his  good name as a coauthor of a biparti san substitute is an impediment to our  coming  together as we have always  done in the past on civil rights legisla tion.  The rule does make in order a substi tute to be offered by me or my desig nee,  and since  the gentleman  from  New York [Mr. LAFALCE] had done so  much missionary work in crafting an  alternative to the base bill, we thought  it only appropriate  to give him  the  honor and recognition to be the lead  sponsor of the substitute, and while  the gentleman  from New York has  begged off being accorded that recog nition we are still prepared to give him  for his language, I shall exercise the  privilege, Mr. Chairman, of designat ing the gentleman from Pennsylvania  [Mr. GOODLING] to formally cosponsor  the substitute with me and handle the  allocation of time on this side of the  aisle.  But before doing so, Mr. Chairman, I  should like  to read a  letter into the  RECORD that I received from the Presi dent  last night  setting  forth quite  clearly his position on this legislation.  It is dated August 2, 1990, the White  House.  THE WHITE HOUSE,  Washington, August 2, 1990.  Hon. ROBERT H. MICHEL,  Republican Leader, House of Representa tives, Washington, DC.  DEAR BoB:  I have consistently expressed  my desire to sign into law a civil rights bill. I  have also consistently worked with both the  Senate and the House to forge a bipartisan  consensus to address these issues in a con structive manner.  The bipartisan amendment to be offered  by  you  and  John LaFalce  represents  a  sound, practical compromise  that my Ad ministration can and will support.  Unfortunately, Kennedy-Hawkins, the bill  you are seeking to amend is neither sound  nor practical.  am convinced it will have  the effect of  forcing businesses  to adopt  quotas in hiring and promotion. It will also  foster divisiveness and litigation rather than  conciliation and do more to promote legal  fees than civil rights.  The other two amendments to the original  bill, which I understand will be offered on  the floor today, in fact, do nothing to cure  the bill's defects.  hope  the House will  I  I  reject these superficial attempts to create  the illusion of fixing the problems in the  bill. I want to make it clear that the adop tion of these  two amendments would not  result in a bill I can sign.  Again, I could sign the bipartisan compro mise  represented by your amendment.  commend you and others for your painstak ing efforts to produce sound civil rights leg islation.  Sincerely,  I  GEORGE BUSH.  At this juncture, Mr. Chairman, as I  indicated  I would,  I  ask unanimous  consent that the balance of the time  on this side of the aisle be under the  control of the distinguished gentleman  from Pennsylvania  [Mr. GOODLING],  who is so well versed in all of the intri cacies of the proposed legislation.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Illinois?  There was no objection.  The CHAIRMAN. The distinguished  minority leader,  the gentleman from  Illinois CMr. MICHEL] has yielded the  control of his time to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania  [Mr. GooDLING].  The  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr. GOODLING J  reserved, under  the  rule, the balance of his time.  ",1990
983,22,16,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Chairman, I ask  unanimous consent that I be allowed  to yield one-half of the time in opposi tion to th£; amendment to the gentle man from California [Mr. HAWKINS],  and  that he be permitted  to yield  blocks of time to other Members.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Texas?  There was no objection.  ",1990
984,22,16,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman,  I want  to  tell  the  gentleman from Illinois [Mr. MICHEL],  that I, too, was here and voted for the  1964 and 1965 acts, and I  remember  the  legislation  creating  the  Civil  Rights Commission. I also remember  an event that many Members probably  do not remember-the circulation of  the Southern Manifesto, which was an  earlier effort to limit civil rights. I did  not sign  the Southern Manifesto.  I  was one of a handful who did not from  Texas or Louisiana, Mississippi, or Ala bama or Georgia.  It was sort of a  shaky vote, but we survived.  Mr. Chairman, there is one addition al change that should be made to the  Republican amendment in the nature  of a substitute in order to show what  its  true  intent  is. The  short  title  should be changed to read as follows:  ""This act may be cited as  the Civil  Wrongs Act of 1990.""  Very  simply put,  this Republican  substitute rips the heart out of H.R.  4000. The Civil Rights Act of 1990 was  intended  to overturn  five Supreme  Court decisions that have hamstrung  ",1990
985,35,16,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New York  [Mr. LAFALCE], who has  shown the strength of his convictions.  D 1240  ",1990
986,35,16,Mr. LAF ALCE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  today  in  support of  the  substitute  amendment.  I  said yesterday,  I  say  again today, we need a strong and a  fair civil  rights  law. The recent Su preme Court cases of  the last  term  have created a need for new legisla tion. And even after reversal of these  decisions and restoration of preexist ing  law,  that  is not good  enough.  There  is a need for a stronger civil  rights  law that was passed 26 years  ago in a different time in different cir cumstances.  But let me also express the need for  a fair civil rights bill, a bill that equal ly balances the rigths of a plaintiff  and a defendant, an accuser and the  accused.  We must not unbalance the scales of  justice. That will not  advance  the  cause of civil rights.  Nor will the cause of civil rights be  advanced if what we do today leads to  a veto. And both of these prospects  concern me deeply.  We passed two amendments yester day;  I voted for both of  them. But  there are countless other  legitimate  questions that have been raised about  disparate-impact cases, especially.  I am troubled by the issue of causa tion involving a group of employment  practices, I am troubled by the defini tion of business necessity, I am also  deeply troubled at converting the rec onciliation process under  the EEOC  into  an  adversarial  process  before  judge and jury. That is a fundamental  change in title VII. It has nothing to  do with Supreme Court cases.  Nor am I persuaded that the cap  that was approved last night will pre vent punitive  judgments from being  rendered  by  juries  in  exorbitant  amounts.  There is, for example, no limit on  damages for pain and suffering. The  line between damages for pain and suf fering and punitive damages is impos sible or difficult to discern and very,  very easy to transgress.  Now, there is a substitute before us  today. That substitute is not perfect,  either, but it is a good-faith effort to  advance the cause. It is a good-faith  effort  to serve as a bridge between  polar differences. It does address the  Supreme Court decisions in question,  it really does. And it goes further by  making major  improvements  under  current law.  It contains new and equitable reme dies,  immediate injunctive relief and  up to $100,000 in equitable relief. That  does -not exist  right now,  remedies  that can be used to fight harassment,  retaliation and other on-the-job dis crimination.  Now, I also know, after considerable  discussion with  civil  rights  leaders,  that they have deep concerns about  the substitute that is before us today,  as I have deep concerns about Kenne dy-Hawkins.  Should  the  substitute  pass  before  a  conference  report  emerges, those concerns must be dealt  with. But what do we do today?  I am going to make a suggestion to  both sides. I am going to suggest, in  order to deal with the differences, in  order to deal with the divisions that  we have seen, a vote ""yes"" on the sub stitute and then, whatever happens, a  vote ""yes"" on final passage, on every body's part.  Now, if we vote ""yes"" on the substi tute, we go  to conference with  the  Senate with dozens of differences be tween the House bill and the Senate  bill. And we can work, and I know we  would work, to come out on a biparti san or nonpartisan fashion with a bill  that the President could sign.  So, if the substitute passes, I urge all  of us to vote ""yes"" on final passage.  If the substitute should fail, I have a  concern. There is virtually nothing to  go  to conference on other than the  issue of the cap on punitive damages.  It is identical.  The President has  said  that cap  means nothing, both personally and in  writing. He has said he could not sign  Kennedy-Hawkins.  I  am fearful  that political games manship  could  be  played,  and we  would  be more  interested  in  just  taking the two bills,  ironing out the  differences on the cap in an hour and  sending the bill to the President, and  we would not have advanced the cause  of civil rights.  But if good faith is shown, it is possi ble to forget about the fact that there  is little to conference about. If good  faith is shown, it is possible to still get  together with those who have difficul ties and with the President and come  up with a bill that could receive the  signature of the President or, if not, a  bill on which there would be such a  consensus  that  it would  have  to  become law.  Because of that good faith for which  I would hope, I will vote for the substi tute and urge everyone to. If it passes,  please vote for final passage, do not  vote against it.  If the substitute goes down, please  vote  for  final passage of Kennedy Hawkins. Do not vote against it.  And both sides, whoever gets to con ference, show good faith. Let us have a  civil rights bill that an overwhelming,  at  least  a  two-thirds,  consensus of  both bodies can support. I want very  much to work in that direction.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will an nounce to those Members controlling  the  time  that  the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania [Mr. GOODLING] has 12  minutes  remaining,  the  gentleman  from California [Mr. HAWKINS] has 13  minutes  remaining,  the  gentleman  from Texas [Mr. BROOKS] has 8¥2 min utes  remaining,  and  the gentleman  from Texas [Mr. BROOKS] reserves the  right to close debate.  ",1990
987,35,16,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Montana [Mr. WILLIAMS] a member of  the Committee  on Education  and  Labor.  ",1990
988,35,16,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Chairman and  my colleagues,  last night and again  this morning I sat through most of the  debate. Last evening about 8 o'clock, I  went out onto the west portico and  watched the sunset for a while. There  were people milling around out there,  a couple of dozen tourists, I suppose,  looking down The Mall at the beauti ful  scene; down The Mall  to  those  monuments  to our  freedoms. They  seemed unaware that in the people's  House behind them, here in this room,  another civil rights debate was occur ing.  It is not that those tourists were un concerned, and I do not denigrate the  debate; I seek, rather, to define it.  We are all of us involved at a stage  in  the  long march of  this Nation  toward civil rights. The steps we are  taking now are small ones. It was not  always so.  In the 1860's and again in the 1960's  blood was  spilled between brothers  and friends, careers were lost, men and  women were killed.  But in those two great tests, one the  Civil War and  the other  the Civil  Rights Act of a quarter century ago,  this Nation  took  gigantic  steps  to  assure simple freedoms. Is it not odd  that the greatest political struggles of  the 200-year history of  this Nation  have been to assure and preserve our  simplest of freedoms?  We are not taking a large step this  week; but small steps are  important  too. These small,  incremental steps,  about which the lawyers understand ably argue, are very important in this  Nation's  long march  toward  civil  rights.  In  the 1960's, our colleagues,  the  Members of the House of Representa tives, voted to change America forever,  to say that never again would a race of  people be relegated to the back of de mocracy's bus.  D 1250  People were not milling around un concerned outside  then. The world  held its breath to see if this Nation  would renew itself.  Today's debate is not about a great  step. It is an incremental change, but  the sides are the same, the arguments  are the same. We can, in a couple of  hours here, vote for the private sector,  which would be a vote for Michel-La Falce, or we can vote for the private  citizen which would be a vote ""no."" It  is the same vote we took a quarter of a  ",1990

990,74,16,Mr. RINALDO.," Mr. Chairman,  there  is no  more  important  issue now before Congress  than  campaign  reform.  For  that  reason,  I  regret that the efforts undertaken a year and a  half ago have given way to partisan politics in stead of a meaningful, bipartisan bill.  Make no mistake: We need  reform. We  need a good, comprehensive, fair bill. And we  need it now.  Probably every Member of  this Chamber  has been  the subject of an editorial about  fundraising-about the role of money in poli tics and  in our own campaigns-and we are  all familiar with the innuendo and insinuation  that it is the special interests with the biggest  bank rolls who really call the shots.  That is unfair. It is untrue. And we all know  it.  But what do we do about it?  How do we convince your constituents and  mine that Congress isn't for sale? How do we  prove  to  them  that  the system  really does  work and that it is not driven by money?  The last thing we should do is get bogged  down in partisan politics and start pointing fin gers across the aisle, blaming each other for  blocking reform.  Unfortunately, that is what we are engaged  in doing, instead of taking the opportunity and  passing a substantive bill.  We all know reform will not be easy. I think  the efforts of our colleagues since the begin ning of last year have proven that.  Whaf we need is political leadership-from  the President and from the Speaker and from  the majority and minority leaders in the House  and in the other body. That is the kind of lead ership that will produce a realistic, fair, effec tive bill.  But let us not kid anybody: We all know that  we are not going  to write a meaningful bill  here on the House floor. True reform will be  the product of bipartisan negotiations, not par tisan bickering. And it is going to take conces sions from both sides of the aisle.  We all know what happens without it.  We give people a perfect opportunity  to  continue denigrating  the  institution and  the  system and their elected representatives.  We should not allow that to happen.  We are never going  to remove all money  from politics.  When I first ran for Congress in 1972, my  campaign cost about $100,000.  But just 1 O years later, I was faced with a  tremendous challenge.  I had an opponent who was independently  wealthy. He was instrumental in gerrymander ing my State. And he went on to spend $2.3  million against me in an effort to win a seat in  this Chamber.  It  is  the  largest amount of  money ever spent by a congressional candi date in the history of our country.  I didn't spend nearly that much-in fact,  was outspent by 3 to 1.  But there is something wrong  in a system  that allows  that  to  happen. Seats  in  this  I  Chamber should not be for sale-not to the  special  interests, not  to anyone, not at any  time.  We all have different ideas on how we need  to reform  it. Those ideas deserve legitimate,  substantive debate-not partisanship.  I urge my colleagues in  the leadership, on  both sides of the aisle, to renew their efforts  to enact meaningful reform.  We deserve it. Our constituents deserve it.  And the institution deserves it.  ",1990
991,74,16,Mr. THOMAS  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.  I would have  liked to have had a  general debate on each of the number  of positions that the gentleman from  Washington has articulated as part of  the Democrat campaign plan. We on  our side of the aisle went through a  very arduous process trying to deter mine what we thought would be an ap propriate campaign  reform position,  not just a single item, but a compre hensive package.  As I indicated on the debate on the  rule, I think we could have come to an  agreement on a number of those areas,  as we have done in the past. Unfortu nately, we had no opportunity to con sider this legislation under the com mittee structure-a structure in which  we have taken testimony in the past and we have never sat down in what  we call a markup and made the tough  decisions. Instead, the Democrats got  together on  their  side and decided  what they wanted, Republicans got to gether on their side and decided what  we wanted. Now, what normally hap pens in the usual legislative process is  after Members do that, we then come  together  and  discuss  the  relative  merits and pick and choose between  the two positions. We are not going to  do that here today because the Demo crats did not write a rule that would  provide Members an opportunity to do  that.  Oftentimes,  the  Democrats  tell  Members that Republicans are irrele vant. Oftentimes, we decide ourselves  we  are  irrelevant  to  the  process.  Frankly, that is not true.  I happen to serve on the Committee  on Ways and Means as another one of  my assignments, and more often than  not, Democrats on  that  committee  have come  to me and said, ""Thank  goodness you were in the room when  we decided on the policy because you  saved us from ourselves,"" and that, in  fact, better legislation comes out of  the  process of  accommodation  and  compromise than that legislation that  Democrats or even Republicans can  write by themselves.  So  let Members now  revisit, once  again, the legislation that we have in  front of Members, that the Democrats  are so proud of, that they believe is  comprehensive  campaign  finance  reform, although it has been altered  just as recently as 24 hours ago. If  Members recall, and return once again  with me to Swift 1-and the gentle man  from Washington prefers  that  the modification be Swift 1.1. I was de bating Swift and not-so-Swift, but I  will accept his Swift 1 and Swift 1.1.  If Members  recall under Swift 1,  some group of Democrats decided that  there ought to be criminal penalties  for  overspending  in  their  liberal  spending structure. As Members recall,  after those Democrat Members who  wanted a  little freer operation spoke  for Swift 1.1, that portion of Swift 1  was struck.  If Members will  recall,  originally  some Democrats wanted to ban regis tered lobbyists from bundling and de livering money. But at  the eleventh  hour, those who wanted a little looser  structure said, ""Strike that.""  Originally, some folks wanted to ban  slate cards financed by corporations,  unions,  and millionaires. But guess  what? There are some folks who oper ate with straight cards, and they did  not want that hampering the good old  way of doing business. So what hap pened? That was struck from Swift 1.  And that is what produced Swift 1.1.  But more important than that, some  Members sat down and said,  ""Look,  what you are doing after all is limiting  us, and we don't want to be limited  quite as much  as you  indicate we  should be limited."" So where Swift 1  had $550,000, Swift 1.1, if they get less  than 66. 7 percent of the vote,  limits  them to $715,000.  Now,  the gentleman  from  Illinois  CMr. HAYES]  said he was concerned  about whether or not he should really  support this bill because he won his  election with  a  lot of union PAC  money.  It is perfectly  legal  to  take  union PAC money. But one of  the  things that has been discussed is how  much PAC money is in the system. I  indicated to Members that one of the  most comprehensive recent studies in dicated  that although the American  public is concerned about how much  money we spend, they are more con cerned about  the question of  influ ence. Who controls  the amount of  PAC money? And the gentleman from  Washington is advertising the Demo crat plan as the Campaign Cost Re duction Act of 1990.  Well, under current law in the 1988  general election cycle, $99.1 million  was collected by Democrat and Repub lican general election candidates from  PAC's. What would happen  if the  Campaign Cost Reduction Act of 1990  goes into effect? In terms of contribu tions from PAC's $223.6 million would  be available. That  is  the Campaign  Cost Reduction Act of 1990 in regard  to PAC receipts.  The gentleman from Illinois should  not worry, there is plenty of room for  his folk.  In addition to that, we have talked  about spending limits, that what this  ",1990
992,87,16,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the bill drafted so carefully  by Mr. SWIFT, also in support of the  Synar-Obey amendment.  I take particular pride in one provi sion which would provide a 100-per cent tax credit for in-State contribu tions of $50 or less. I believe I am accu rate in saying that this provision first  came to the U.S. Congress in 1977 in a  bill that I introduced in my first year  in Congress, an idea that I brought  with me from  the Ohio Legislature,  where I first developed it.  I was a voice in the wilderness for 8  years. Then all of a sudden this provi sion  began  to  become  included  in  mainstream campaign finance reform  legislation.  All of us, Mr. Chairman, will be  better off if we seek to fund our com paigns with smaller donations  from  our own constituents. The 100-percent  tax credit will give us every incentive  to do so and will give our constituents  every  incentive  to help  finance our  campaigns.  Again, I urge support for the bill and  for the Obey-Synar amendment.  ",1990

994,87,16,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  I rise in support of campaign finance  reform.  Today's campaign finance system is a dis grace. Campaign reform is long overdue.  Unlimited spending  in campaigns has cre ated the impression that seats in Congress go  to the highest bidder; that incumbents-due to  their  fundraising  advantage-can never be  beat;  that money  is more  important  than  people.  This campaign reform bill will, finally, put an  overall  lid on  spending; will help even  the  odds for challengers; and will move politics  away from expensive, impersonal media cam paigns and back to the people.  Excessive contributions from  special  inter est political action committees [PAC's] have  given these groups too much influence in the  political process. This campaign reform bill restricts PAC contributions to no more than 50  percent of a candidate's total budget. That will  reduce the role and influence of special inter ests and, appropriately, increase a candidate's  reliance on support from  individuals  in  their  district.  Negative ads by one candidate attacking  another are becoming commonplace in recent  elections. No campaign reform can stop nega tive campaigning. But  this campaign  reform  bill requires the mudslingers to show their own  faces in the negative ads and publicly accept  responsibility for the content of the ads.  In today's campaigns, individual contributors  play to small a role, in part, because the 1986  tax  reform  repealed  the political contribution  tax credit. This campaign reform bill restores  that credit for contributions of $50 or less. En couraging more voters to support candidates  with small donations will serve to democratize  our political system.  In America we don't want a system support ed by the wealthy and the big-buck PAC's. We  need to return the government to the people.  The campaign reforms  in  this bill will help  achieve that objective. I urge support for the  bill.  ",1990

996,87,16,Mr. MCMILLEN of Maryland.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  in support of  the  Swift bill.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the  Campaign Cost Reduction and Reform Act of  1990, and also note my support for the Synar Obey amendment.  Mr. Chairman, for years the cost of Federal  election campaigns have spiraled up and up.  The high price of television advertising, com puters, and polling  is  forcing candidates  to  spend increasing amounts of time or raising  money, rather focusing on the issues.  Representative Sw1FT's proposal  is an ex cellent step forward  to  reforming a system  that is in serious need of change. Most impor tant,  it places a cap on campaign financing.  The Bill  also  reduces  the  influence of  so called fat cat PAC's that do not get most of  their funds from the small contributor. The bill  treats  these PAC's differently,  reducing  the  amount they can give to each campaign. And,  it effectively ends the soft money scam that  has been a big loophole to our campaign dis closure system.  I also want to express my support for the  Synar-Obey amendment which will be offered  to the Swift bill. This additional proposal adds  even more teeth to the Swift bill by reducing  the aggregate PAC  limit to 40 percent of the  spending limit; cuts in half individual contribu tions;  and  increases  the  reporting  require ments  to  the Federal Election Commission.  The measure is also a major improvement to  our system by limiting to 1 O percent of a can didates spending limit, the amount that can be  taken for the fat cat PAC's I must admit that I  have severe reservations about the public fi nancing aspect of this measure-but, on the  whole,  it will  improve  the overall  election  system.  Mr. Chairman, the Republican substitute is  not a genuine attempt at campaign finance  reform, but a partisan proposal  to  improve  their chances for election. They cannot get a  majority of voters to support them at the polls,  so  they want  to change  the  rules  in  their  favor. No spending limits, no restrictions on in dividual expenditures, no decent reform of soft  money.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the  Swift proposal, and  the Synar-Obey amend ment. The American public  is clammoring for  compaign finance reform, we cannot miss this  opportunity today.  ",1990

998,87,16,Mr. KOSTMA YER.," I thank the gen tleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, many years ago when  Jim Farley was Postmaster General  under Franklin Roosevelt, he got mad  at some liberal, good government type  politician out in the State of Washing ton and made a disparaging remark  about the progressive nature of the  politics of the State of Washington.  He said there are 47 States and the  Soviet of Washington.  Well, that was a disparaging remark  made in an intemperate moment, but  Washington has been  a  progressive  State, rich in the politics of clean gov ernment, good government. So it is no  surprise that the two men who bring  this  legislation  to us  tonight  come  from the great State of Washington,  AL SWIFT and TOM FOLEY.  AL SWIFT deserves credit for writing  it,  ToM  FOLEY  deserves  credit  for  making the House vote on it.  Campaign  finance  is  an  area  in  which we are all experts, all 435 of us.  All of us got here under this system,  all of us are apprehensive, understand ably, about seeing it changed.  Some in our own caucus urge us to  wait. I ask wait for what? For more  money, for more millions of dollars to  be spent, for more people in this coun try to be alienated from the system,  for more young Americans  to  turn  away  from politics,  for  lower voter  turnout?  This legislation has  two  important  components  the  American  people  ought  to understand:  It limits  the  amount of money you can spend in a  campaign for Congress, and it limits  the amount of money you can take  from PAC's.  That is what this legislation is all  about. We are for it, they are against  it; it is as simple as that.  This sets limits. In 1988 I spent $1.1  million to be elected to Congress. If  this becomes law, I will not be able to  do it again. I do not want to be able to  do it again, I should not be able to do  it again, none of us should be able to  spend that kind of money.  If this legislation passes, it can help  to begin to remake the face of politics  in our country. It would be embarrass ing to us to go home tonight for a  monthlong recess and reject campaign  finance  legislation.  I  think the time  ",1990

1000,113,16,Mr. THOMAS  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.  I would ask my colleague from Mas sachusetts, if he is still in the room, if  he would simply listen for a moment  or two. I will try to reduce his apoplec tic concern about the Republican sub stitute, but, first of all, let me call the  Members' attention once again  to a  survey completed March 3, 1990, called  Money and Politics: A Survey of Na tional Opinion. This is sponsored by  the Advocacy Institute, Public Citizen,  that is Ralph Nader, and People for  the American Way. It is currently the  most comprehensive, the most indepth  analysis of where the American public  is on  the question of campaign  fi nance.  I would call  the attention of  the  Members to one of the questions that  was asked, and you have got it over  here.  D 2120  Is it a good idea, a bad idea, or do  you have an opinion on the question,  that the bulk of campaign funds ought  to come from the district or the State?  The American people, by 80 percent,  say the bulk ought to come from your  district. Then they probed it a  little  more precisely, and what happened?  The next question was ""Would you  support requiring 75 percent of a can didate's campaign funds to come from  the district or State?""  Mr. Chairman, look at that dropoff.  We have all been elected. We know  what dropoff means-76 percent of the  American people say 75 percent of the  money ought to come from  the dis trict.  Now we are at the heart of the argu ment. The Democrat proposal, Swift  1.1, as amended by Synar-Obey, says  you can take more than a quarter of a  million dollars from PAC's. You do not  need one dime from your district. Not  one dime. You can take up to $550,000,  and if you do not get a two-thirds pri mary vote, you can take up to $715,000  under your proposal, and not one dime  has to come from your district. It can  come from Washington,  it can come  from Dallas,  it can come from any where but your district, up to $715,000.  You do not need one penny from the  people who vote for you. That is your  plan, that is your reform.  Mr. Chairman, let us take a look at  the Republican substitute. Yes,  it  is  simple. Maybe you missed the point. It  is so simple you do not understand it.  It is simply this. The American people  said, 80 percent of them, we want you  to go home and raise your money in  your district. 76 percent of them said,  make it 75 percent of your money.  Your plan says zero. That is not fun damental reform, that is the same old  business, but just a little bit less.  The  Republican  plan  says  you  cannot take a dime from Washington,  you cannot take a dime from a PAC,  you cannot take a dime from someone  who cannot vote for you unless you  get  the dime  from  the people back  home first.  Now, you have talked about funda mental reform. Let us put your vote  where your mouth is. What we have in  the Republican substitute  is  the re quirement,  one,  that  you  go  back  home. Pretty shocking. Second,  that  you raise the bulk of your money from  the people back home. You do not get  a dime from PA C's, you do not get a  dime from people outside the district,  until  you get  that dime  from  the  people back home.  No,  it is not an arbitrary spending  limit.  It  is  a  reempowering of  the  people who are tired of the process.  What it says  is you go back to  the  people who vote for you, and you let  them determine how much money is  spent  in  a  campaign. You  let  the  people back home determine whether  you take that PAC dollar.  No, it is not an unlimited opportuni ty  to  take PAC money. You get a  dollar of PAC money if you can con vince a person back home to give you a  dollar of their hard-earned dollars.  When does it enable? The $10 con tributor. Today, back home, somebody  who give $50 or $100,  is simply  ig nored. You have got to get the $1,000,  the $2,000.  Mr. Chairman, let me tell Members,  if you have to get a dollar from home  before you can get a dollar from a  PAC group, you are going to look at  that $10 contribution  in a different  way. You are going to pay attention to  the person with $50. If you do not get  that $50 contribution, you do not get  the $50 from the outside. Let me tell  Members,  today we have PAC fund raisers. People  come  and  give  you  $1,000, and they do not like you. But  they smile and they shake your hand.  You go back home and  try  it, and  guess what? If they do not like the  way you vote,  they do not give you  $10. Guess what else they do? They go  around and tell their neighbors they  do not like you.  Mr. Chairman, what the Republican  substitute will do is turn this process  back on its head. It will put us back  where we are supposed to be in our  districts.  People complain that we  raise  too  much money. It is not that we raise  too much money, it is that we do not  raise the money at home. We are in  Washington, we are in Los Angeles, we  are in Dallas. We are not in our dis tricts, unless, of course, Washington,  Los Angeles, or Dallas is in your dis trict. Then that is where you should  be, and, God bless you, because you  have got a good district.  It is not arbitrary, but it enables the  people back home to tell you enough  is enough, because if you do not get a  dollar from them, you cannot take a  dollar  from PA C's or anybody else.  Simple, yes; fundamental change, yes.  ",1990

1002,113,16,Mr. MOODY.," Mr. Chairman,  the  gentleman  from  California  [Mr.  THOMAS]  just treated us to a wonder ful show. But according to his argu ments, I guess the gentleman must be  supporting  the Synar-Obey  amend ment,  since  it  emphasizes  small  donors.  The  preceding  arguments  really argue for an Synar-Obey type  amendment, since  it emphasizes  the  small doner even more than the un derlying Swift bill. I hope the gentle man  from California  [Mr. THOMAS]  will support the Obey-Synar amend ment when it comes to a vote after we  rise.  But the basic point I would like to  make it not that the Republican bill  has absolutely no merit, and maybe  one could argue  that the point  the  gentleman raises makes the Republi can more meritorious in that one di mension. But, Mr. Chairman, let me  point out some dimensions where the  Republican bill is seriously lacking.  No.  1,  the Republican bill has no  ceiling, no ceiling at all on total cam paign spending. The Democratic pack age does.  No. 2,  the Republican package has  no aggregate limit on PAC contribu tions. None whatsoever. The Demo cratic does.  No. 3,  the Republican package has  no real shutdown of soft money sys tems, sometimes called sewer money.  The Democratic package goes a  long  way to do that.  No. 4, the Republican package does  not have any ban at all on bundling by  political parties. The Democratic pack age does not only that, but also con trols the bundling of PAC's.  No. 5,  the Republican package has  no reduction on the cost of communi cating with constituents through elec tronic media. The Democratic package  does that. It makes access greater for  those who do not have large amounts  of money.  No. 6, the Republican package does  nothing to  tighten or regulate  inde pendent expenditures, which are the  real  scourge  of  the  political  cam paigns, frequently run along negative  lines. The Democratic package does do  that. It puts a strong discouragement  on independent expenditures.  ",1990

1006,126,16,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, first I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  Let me say that I am very reluctant,  but I will not object. I do want to say  to the House that this is one more pro crastination. We have deadlines with out penalties, promises without per formance, meetings without meaning.  We have been in a summit for 86  da:ys, 3 months. President Bush and  his team have bent over backward, but  nothing has happened.  I rise in particular to set the record  straight about something. Tonight on  MacNeil-Lehrer the Speaker apparent ly said, ""GINGRICH doesn't really want  a summit agreement."" Let me set the  record straight. Let me set the record  straight.  I  agreed  to be a member of  the  summit understanding what was  in volved. For 10 weeks, and your majori ty leader and your budget committee  chairman will verify this, for 10 weeks  I sat in those meetings, I sought to  avoid arguments, I  tried to listen in tently and I  tried to be helpful. You  can check.  Let me go further. I avoided press  statements about the summit, and as  the majority  leader knows,  as  the  budget chairman knows, I was leaked  against in the press precisely when I  was trying to be helpful, and as they  both know,  those  leaks were distor tions of my position.  I have said publicly  I believe  the  summit process has failed up to this  point. Now we have a series of newspa per articles, including one yesterday in  the Washington Post, which specifical ly cite a strategy of three Democratic  Senators to delay as long as possible.  Those are not my words,  those are  words in the Washington Post, quite  clearly. I  just want to set the record  straight.  If we can get to a binding agreement  for 5 years in one vote, then I am pre pared to vote for it, if it fits the values  that Bush has stated publicly he be lieves in.  D 2340  If we cannot, then I am prepared to  oppose it when it comes up. I  think  those of us who have been  in that  room have tried pretty darn hard to  tolerate each other for more hours, in  a small space, than any of us wanted. I  am prepared to go back in September.  I just wanted to set the record straight  since some on your side seem to be  confused about where we are.  ",1990

But further,  if the gentleman will  yield to me, I would just ask, speaking  basically as our colleague from Penn sylvania did as one who is not in the  summit proceeding, does not see much  progress  coming  up,  understanding  that no one is suggesting that this is  binding and no one is suggesting it will  deal with any of the substantive issues  at issue in the summit process, in all  candor, and I say this to Members on  both sides of the aisle-I am not trying  to single out the distinguished majori ty leader or anyone else-are we doing  anything other than trying to lay a  little  political  groundwork  for  our selves before we  go  home  for  the  August recess?

If we  reassure one another enough  times,  perhaps we will be able to reach that  nirvana that we all seek.  I have been on the inside, and I have  not seen any more progress than you  have seen  from  the outside.  It has  been a frustrating 12 weeks.

We have laws that set dates  for us in the budget process, set dates  for us on the appropriations process,  and we do not meet those.  I am  just at a  loss  to understand  what it is about passing this feel-good  resolution about when we are going to  meet  these deadlines, what we  are  going to do for the next 30 days, what  this-what good this possibly has.  Why cannot the Speaker and the mi nority leader, the majority leader and  minority leader of the Senate walk out  of here and have a press conference  and announce when they are going to  come to some kind of an agreement?  You do not need us to say, we are not  a part of the budget summit process.  You do not need us to day do it. We  need it to be done.

I wish to rise to commend the chair man of the subcommittee, the gentle man from California  [Mr. WAXMAN],  and the ranking minority member, the  gentleman  from  Illinois  [Mr. MAD IGAN],  for  their  leadership on  this  issue.  This legislation is a breakthrough in  AIDS  treatment, and  it shows  that  Congress cares, but not only does  it  care but it is willing  to provide  the  means to care for people with AIDS.  So I commend the gentlemen, thank  them for their hard work for bringing  this conference report to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  conference report on the Ryan White Compre hensive  AIDS  Resources  Emergency  Act  [CARE].  I commend Chairman WAXMAN and  Mr. MADIGAN,  the  ranking minority member,  for their leadership in reaching this agreement.  I also commend Senator KENNEDY and Sena tor HATCH for their efforts to reach this agree ment and  for their bringing such attention to  this issue.  For a city like San Francisco, where close  to 6,000 people have already died of AIDS  and close  to 9,000 cases have been diag  nosed to date, this is legislation that responds  to our real needs. Responding  to the nearly  3,000 San Franciscans  living with AIDS and  the nearly 30,000 San Franciscans living with  HIV  infection must be a national priority as  well as a local priority.  San Francisco has developed model pro grams which are a source of great pride to the  city. But the famous San Francisco model has  been crumbling under the sheer weight of the  numbers of new people needing services. The  CARE legislation offers emergency assistance  that will allow us to restore the humane and  cost-effective continuum of services we need.  The grants to States will allow us to expand  on programs of early  intervention  to prevent  the onset of severe disease in those infected  but not yet sick. The legislation gives us hope.  This  is a fitting  tribute  to Ryan White; his  courage  in  the  face of AIDS  taught us all a  lesson. We evoked caring from a nation that  needed to care, and his plight focused atten tion on the epidemic that we cannot in good  conscience ignore.  Mr. Speaker,  this  legislation allows to pre pare for life rather than death in  face of the  HIV epidemic. Again, my congratulations  to  Chairman WAXMAN, who has done so much  on the AIDS issue and whose leadership has  once again made this House proud.  ",1990

Mr. Speaker, I would like to engage  the subcommittee chairman in a collo quy about one of the provisions in the  bill.  There is a provision in the legisla tion that requires States, as a condi tion of receipt of funds for counseling  and  testing and early  treatment,  to  have laws regarding intentional trans mission of HIV. Could the gentleman  describe the meaning of that section?  ",1990
1022,139,16,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, If the  gentleman will yield that provision re quires that States have on their books  laws that would allow criminal pros ecution  for  intentional  transmission  by blood donation, sexual activity, or  needle sharing.  ",1990

1024,139,16,Mr. WAXMAN.," Yes. While I believe  that such activities are rare, clearly  such intentional spread of the inf ec tion would  have  to  be  prohibited  under State law.  ",1990
1025,139,16,Mr. DANNEMEYER., Would  this  language in any way  limit States to  this  standard of criminal  law? Are  States forbidden to go further in pros ecuting people who spread AIDS?  ,1990
1026,139,16,Mr. WAXMAN.," No. States retain all  their traditional criminal law authori ties. We have  always depended on  States to make criminal law and would  anticipate that they would continue to  do so.  But the bill before us  is a public  health grants program. We did not  feel that we had the information or  expertise  to draft full criminal stat utes in this context. There are many  difficult problems of standards of cul pability, proof, and evidence which we  could not deal with  in this context.  But States clearly retain all authority  to deal with these issues themselves.  ",1990
1027,139,16,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in  support of  this  conference  report. There is one essential feature  of what we need in our law to control  this epidemic, and I will not take a lot  of my colleagues' time this evening to  talk about that. Any person who be lieves  that  this epidemic  is on  the  downslide in America and around the  world should disabuse  themselves of  that notion.  I make reference to a report of the  New England Journal of Medicine July  26, 1990, which discusses in part the  results of testing in 26 sentinel hospi tals across the country from January  1988  to June 1989. The incidence of  the infection of men 25  to 40  in cer tain of those hospitals located in the  Northeast is absolutely devastating in  terms of the impact  For example, in the Northeast, one  hospital,  21. 7  percent  of  the men  tested were HIV positive. That is the  highest. Fortunately, most of  them  were lower than that.  What  this data  shows  is,  clearly,  that the epidemic is alive and flourish ing, mostly  in urban areas  in  this  country. One day this country and this  Government is going to put in place  the cornerstone of what our Public  Health should have been doing to con trol this epidemic from the beginning  of  its existence  in  the early 1980's,  namely, reportability to Public Health  in  confidence  and contract  tracing.  That now  is  the recommendation of  the American Medical Association that  all States have such a policy in place.  Unfortunately,  the House  did  not  choose to implement that recommen dation of the American Medical Asso ciation when we considered this legis lation when it passed the House earli er this year in an amendment that I  offered.  However, I will continue to present  that possibility to the Members at the  next time when the House considers  this issue.  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today is the  result of compromises and agreements  that  were achieved  in  this body, and an entirely  new set of compromises that were arrived at  after weeks of negotiation with our colleagues  in the Senate. I believe the final product, while  not perfect, deserves our support.  A NEW APPROACH TO THE WAR ON HIV INFECTION  What will  this  legislation do? For  the  first  time, it will commit billions of dollars in Feder al  resources  to  the war against a killer dis ease-the human immunodeficiency virus that  ultimately results  in  full-blown AIDS. What is  most impressive about S. 2240 is that it tar gets  these scarce  resources on  low-income  individuals and limits the use of these funds to  cost-efficient expenditures such as HIV coun seling and testing, clinical and diagnostic serv ices,  therapeutic measures, and  referrals  to  providers of appropriate support services. No  funds in this bill will be spent on costly hospi",1990

1029,152,16,Mr. GOSS.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  support of  the  rule  and  commend  Chairman  JONES  for his persistence  and hard work.  Mr. Speaker, tonight we have the opportuni ty to complete some very necessary work that  began more  than 15 years ago and which  lead to the adoption of landmark oilspill pre this House a months  vention  legislation by  ago.  In the 8 months since we passed the oilspill  bill, the conference process has taken place,  and unfortunately so have many disastrous  oilspills. Arthur Kill,  the Mega Borg explosion,  and  now Galveston  Bay  have  repeatedly  awakened  the Nation's  conscience  to  the  he~vy toll our coasts endure from up to 8,000  spills a year. Continuously, our Nation has re vealed itself to be badly underprepared to ef fectively combat oilspills.  This debate  focuses on  the  rule, and not  the bill itself. However, if we defeat this rule  our Nation will be unnecessarily left at risk b;  the 600 to 1,000 oilspills which we can rea sonably project could happen in the next 1 to  2 months. That's neither sound  fiscal policy  nor wise environmental policy.  We have good  legislation before us whose  timeliness cannot be contested. Now  is not  the moment to delay this bill over some  last  minute minutiae.  Our Nations' energy security obviously must  not be held hostage by the threat posed by a  dangerous madman  in  Iraq, and similarly we  also cannot allow our Nation's coasts to be  held hostage  to  the daily barrage of oilspills  against which we need better defenses.  We need the oilspill cleanup trust fund. We  need  the emergency strike  teams. We need  the research and development funds  to fight  future spills. Mr. Speaker, we need an oilspill  bill, and we need it now. I urge my colleagues  to support the rule and the bill.  I  the gentlewo~an  ",1990

1031,152,16,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker  I rise  in support of the rule for H.R. '1465the Oil Pollution Prevention and Li ability Act.  For the past year,  the Nation has  been faced with the need to clean up  oil spills on virtually all of its coasts.  H.R. 1465 contains the comprehensive  measures-such  as  double  hulls on  tankers-designed to prevent such dis asters and adequately address  them  should they occur in the future.  As has been said on this floor al ready, the contents of this bill are ex tremely vital  to  the  future of  this  country-to its energy future-particu larly in view of this week's events.  Therefore, we must proceed to pass  this  important  piece  of  legislation  now. We cannot afford any delay.  Mr. Speaker, this not a perfect rule,  but I support the rule and I urge my  colleagues to do likewise in the name  of marine safety and protecting the  environment.  ",1990

1035,152,16,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the rule and the legislation.  Mr. Speaker,  I rise to congratulate my col leagues who worked so long, and so hard to  hammer out the Oil Pollution Prevention Re sponse, Liability and Compensation Act before  this House, today.  This legislation is a giant step forward in the  protection  of  our Nation's  natural marine  treasures.  Importantly,  for  the people of the  Pacific Northwest,  this  legislation has signifi cant protections for two crown  jewels of our  region-the Columbia River and Puget Sound.  Both  receive significant  traffic  in petroleum  and fertilizer cargoes. Both will get new safe guards against spills, and assurances for more  rapid and effective cleanup under this bill.  I also thank the conferees for their willing ness to consider and incorporate language on  enforcement of contingency planning which  mirrored  legislation  introduced  last spring by  me and two Oregon colleagues-LES AUCOIN  and PETER DEFAZIO. This much-needed addi tion will  give  the Environmental Protection  Agency a significant new hammer-fines of up  to $25,000 per day-to use against hazardous  chemical carriers who refuse to do good-faith  contingency planning  for spills. This kind of  good-faith  planning-planning  that  includes  the  provision  of equipment and  personnel  needed  to do  the  job-greatly reduces  the  bad effects of spills when they do occur. One  need  look no  further than  the Exxon Valdez  ?isaster to see what happens when planning  1s poor, half-hearted, or non-existent: spill im pacts are many times worse, and many times  more expensive to deal with.  This bill helps cure that problem as well as  many others concerning the protection of this  Nation's coastlines and waterways.  I urge my  colleagues to vote for it.  I urge the President  to sign it.  ",1990

We have sent seven oil pollution bills  to the Senate over the 15112 years that  I have been here. It has taken us the  better part of 1112 years to move this  through to this point, through seven  different committees of the House and  probably one of the most painful con ferences  that has  taken place, and  frankly the conference has been dis banded.  So I would urge you to vote for the  previous question, and for the rule.  ",1990

1040,165,16,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in  strong support of the conference report to the  Oil Pollution, Prevention, Response Liability  and Compensation Act, H.R. 1465, and urge  my colleagues to support  this much needed  piece of legislation.  For as long as I have been in public office I  have been concerned about oilspills and the  problems associated with  them. Having  the  Santa Barbara Channel and  the Channel  Is lands National Park in my district, I am keenly  aware of the need  to protect our waterways  and our pristine and scenic places from  the  damages an oilspill may cause.  Many in the House of Representatives and  in the Nation will recall one of the most noted  oil  related accidents to occur in U.S. waters  prior to the Exxon Valdez spill. I am referring,  of course,  to the Santa Barbara offshore oil  blow of 1969. Some say it was this accident  which  heightened  environmental  awareness  and action regarding the hazards of oil explo ration.  Immediately after  this accident  I au thored  legislation which created a 400,000acre oil-free sanctuary around the Channel Is lands. For most of this decade,  I have been  fighting to get oil tankers to pass outside the  Santa Barbara Channel. Recently, that work  proved  successful when  all  six  companies  shipping  oil  from  Alaska  to  Long  Beach  agreed  to my  request  to send  their  tankers  outside the channel.  Although  these measures have enhanced  the safety of the area, past experience has  shown us  that an uncontained oilspill may  damage even the most protected regions. To  protect those and other regions, passage of  the oilspill conference report  is needed, and  needed now.  Several provisions of the conference report  deserve recognition. I thank the conferees for  recognizing the importance of including provi sions which direct the Coast Gaurd to under take a study on the feasibility of establishing a  tanker-free zone  in the Santa Barbara Chan nel, and for supporting a current study of the  feasibility of establishing a vessel traffic serv ice system in the channel.  Also, by expressly preserving States' au thority to impose additional liability or require ments, and preserving the States' authority to  establish their own spill funds and to impose  fines and penalties, the conference report rec ognizes  the need  for States to protect their  shores and lands.  Requiring double hulls on all new  tankers  and barges operating in U.S. waters is also a  positive step in oilspill prevention. Many have  said  the Prince William Sound accident may  not have occurred  if the Valdez had double  hulls. Passa~ of this double-hull language will  go a  long way  in ensuring greater shippin9  safety.  By establishing new  requirements  to pre vent ""shipping under the influence"" and limit ing the number of hours a crewmember can  work on a vessel, the conference report also  ensures greater safety among shipping per sonnel. The report also ensures faster clean up by granting  limited  immunity  to response  organizations involved in cleanup activities.  I also applaud  the conferees  for  including  new research and development money in the  legislation. We must always endeavor to en hance our ability to lessen the threat of, plan  for, and respond  to oil and hazardous waste  spills. Only through needed research can this  become a reality.  For myself, for my constituents and most of  all,  for  the environment,  I strongly urge my  colleagues to vote for this much needed piece  of legislation.  ",1990

1042,165,16,Mr.  BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  strong support of this conference report.  Rusty old oil tankers move extremely slow,  guided only by old maps and charts, with limit ed maneuverability  and  control.  Likewise,  much needed legislation to forge comprehen sive oilspill liability laws have plodded through  Congress without resolutions to many conten tious  issues. Meanwhile,  these decrepit rust  buckets  for  tankers  have  frequently  run  aground and spilled their vitriol in our beautiful  estuaries and beaches.  Likewise, Congress  after Congress, oilspill  legislation has sput tered, spilled, and sunk.  Mr. Speaker,  I am proud  to point out that  this is no longer the case. We are on the brink  of replacing the rustbucket with new, stronger  vessels, matched by comprehensive oilspill li ability legislation that is designed to make the  polluters pay  for  the cost of cleanup, and  make the safe transport of petroleum a priority  in doing business.  In my  committee, Science,  Space,  and  Technology, we contributed significantly to the  prevention titles in this bill. We are replacing  the old maps and star charts that guided the  tankers  into coral  reefs and beaches with  available, navigational aids to help ship cap tains see where they are going so  they can  prevent a disaster.  These aids, which will enhance maneuver ability and control of the ship,  include sonar,  electronic chart display, and satellite technolo gy which  I inlcuded in this bill as an amend ment  in  committee  last September. These  products have been under development  for  years, at taxpayers expense, and used in mili tary applications. It is important to transfer this  technology to the private sector. This amend ment was suggested to me by a retired radar  expert in my district, Dr. Joseph Ryerson.  I  commend my  colleagues  in  both  the  House and the Senate who worked hard to re solve  the many  issues  that has  forstalled  these  environmental  protections  over  the  years. With  this  legislation we are taking re sponsibility  for  our  actions,  and making  changes  in  the way we do business for the  good of both our economy and our environ ment. Let's pass  this bill  today and  let  the  ship sail to  the President, who  is waiting  to  sign it.  ",1990

Mr. Speaker, at long last, we are prepared  to pass a major oilspill prevention, compensa tion, and cleanup bill.  This bill helps us prevent oilspills by requir ing double hulls on all new tankers. The bill  sets a schedule for retrofitting or retiring the  existing  fleet of single-hull  tankers. While  I  supported the House position calling for elimi nation of all single-hull  tankers  in 15 years,  this provision, Mr. Speaker, is an improvement  over the Senate's provision to study the issue.  Several oil  companies have  indicated  they  plan to retrofit with double hulls sooner than  what is called for in the bill. I applaud their ef forts to add the extra protection to ensure the  quality of our environment nationwide,  in our  region, and in Puget Sound. And I am calling  on all oil companies to follow suit in order to  protect the inland waters of our sound. Puget  ",1990
1047,360,16,Mr. HEFLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  strong support of this resolution. As cochair man of  the House Task Force  in Angola,  I  have become  increasingly concerned about  the desperate situation  in Angola. Hundreds  and  thousands of people are  in danger of  dying if assistance does not begin within the  month.  This resolution seeks to bring together, for  the  first  time,  the Government of Angola  [MPLA] and  the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] in an act of  humanitarian cooperation.  As my colleagues know, Angola has been  enbroiled  in a bitter civil war for the  last 15  years. This, combined with the recent drought  has created a truly alarming situation. We ask  that the MPLA and UNITA begin discussions  with  international  relief  organizations,  the  United Nations and any countries willing  to  offer assistance,  to create an agreement  to  allow relief supplies to be distributed through out all of Angola by the most efficient manner.  It is my hope, and the hope of many of my  colleagues,  that  the peace negotiations be tween  the MPLA and UNITA, which began  several months ago, will be further faciliated  as they work together to resolve this desper ate crisis. We must do what we can  foster  peace in Angola and bring an end to the civil  war.  I ask the members of this Chamber to put  aside  your  own  political  beliefs  on  this  manner, and  to trust your heart. Do  the hu manitarian  thing. Do  the  right  thing. Vote  in  favor of this resolution.  ",1990
1048,360,16,Mr. MCCURDY.," I rise in strong support of the  resolution concerning the tragic famine that is  threatening  the  lives of so many people  in  Angola. This resolution was put together on a  bipartisan basis under  the  leadership of  the  chairman of  the Hunger Committee, Repre sentative TONY HALL, and  it ranking minority  member, Representative BILL EMERSON. It ad dresses what the U.S. Office of Foreign Disas ter Assistance has called the worst humanitar ian crisis on the African Continent.  Mr. Speaker, the importance of this resolu tion  is highlighted by  the  fact  that Angola  faces a famine that could easily rival those ex perienced by Ethiopia and Sudan  in  recent  years. At least 250,000 Agolans face the im mediate threat of starvation, and it is possible  that even more people are at risk. This resolu tion serves as a vehicle to bring this crisis to  the world's attention.  Perhaps equally important, Mr. Speaker, this  resolution  is  a  balanced,  bipartisan  effort  which urges  the Government of Angola and  the UNIT A rebels to set aside political differ ences and work with other countries in south ern Africa to ensure that food is delivered to  all Angolans throughout the country, and to do  so  in  the most efficient and  cost-effective  manner.  It also calls upon the United Nations  to play an active role in developing a compre hensive agreement  for  the safe passage of  relief  supplies,  including  from  neighboring  countries.  Finally, Mr. Speaker,  this  resolution points  out the important fact that this famine is exac erbated by the ongoing civil war in Angola and  uges all parties to the conflict to work toward  a cessation of hostilities and to reach a nego tiated settlement. As chairman of the biparti san House task force on Angola,  I,  too, sup port a negotiated settlement. Indeed, negotia tions are  the only path  to peace  in Angola.  But if Angola is to have a lasting peace and  reduce the possibility of future famines, a vital  component of any negotiated settlement must  be a firm guarantee that Angolans will be able  to determine  their own destiny  through  the  democratic process-a process based on the  consent of the governed  through  free, multi party elections.  Mr. Speaker, Angola  is a country of great  potential.  Instead of experiencing the horrors  of famine, Angola could serve as a breadbas ket  for  the  rest of southern Africa.  It  is my  hope  that  this  resolution will play a part  in  helping Angolans overcome this crisis and join  the community of democratic nations.  ",1990

My  distinguished colleagues,  the ranking  minority member of the subcommit tee, Mr. MADIGAN, the chairman of the  committee, Mr. DINGELL, and the rank ing minority member of the commit tee, Mr. LENT, are original sponsors of  the legislation. It passed the House on  suspension by voice vote on June 18. It  passed the Senate today with a small  amendment by unanimous consent.  The Senate has made only minor  amendments  to  the  bill,  generally  having to do with the distribution of  grants among the States. With respect  to such grants,  it our understanding  that the Centers for Disease Control  has traditionally awarded grants in a  manner that distributes funds equita bly among the principal geographic re gions of the United States. Further, it  is our understanding that CDC takes  into account the severity of the prob lems that the grants are meant to ad dress and the availability of existing  services to deal with such problems. It  is our intention that, in making grants  under this new program, CDC will con tinue to follow these practices.  I urge all Members to support H.R.  4790.  A  few weeks  ago,  thousands  of  people gathered for a marathon race  that was to call attention symbolically  to the ""Race for the Cure"" to breast  cancer. Today, it is necessary for the  Congress to take an important step to  make the prevention and treatment of  such cancer a reality.  H.R.  4790 would  establish  a  new  State  grants  program within  the  Public Health Service Act to provide  preventive mammography  and Pap  smear  screening  services  for  low income women for the early detection  of breast and cervical cancer. In addi tion,  this  program would  support  public  information activities  relating  to the detection and control of breast  and cervical cancer;  in-service educa tion  for health care providers; and  quality  control  standards  for mam mography and Pap smear screening  procedures.  At our hearings on this legislation  last month, Marilyn Tucker Quayle,  the wife of the Vice President, came  before the subcommittee ""to declare  all-out war  against  the  tragedy of  breast cancer."" I think all of us share  Mrs. Quayle's concern that we have  waited far too long in addressing this  major public health problem. I believe  H.R. 4790 will help us finally to mobi lize our public health forces and to  win our war against both breast and  cervical cancer.  ",1990

1058,503,16,Mr. REID.," Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased that Senator HATCH's bill, the  National Atmospheric Nuclear Testing  Compensation Act,  has  passed  the  Senate. I believe this is a giant step  forward for justice.  When I was growing up in Search light, NV, we could see  the flashes  light up the dark morning from tests  being conducted at the Nevada Nucle ar Test Site. But we were lucky. The  wind was blowing the other way.  Others were not so lucky. Kent Car roll was tending sheep when a bomb  was set off in 1953. He was 17. After 9  years of acute suffering, he died of  pancreatic cancer. Nobody told him to  take cover. Nobody told him about the  dangers.  The horror stories are endless. And  they are  the  result of Government  negligence and the negligence of con tractors conducting the tests.  The Government  and  contractors  knew the dangers, but they did noth ing to protect either their employees  or innocent civilians living downwind  from the tests.  Senator HATCH's bill, of which I was  a cosponsor, is a start. But it is just  the first step. My bill, S. 982, the Radi ation Victims Fair Treatment Act,  is  the important second step.  S.  982 would  repeal  the Warner  amendment, which prohibits radiation  victims  from suing  the Government  contractors who conducted the tests.  This bill has 38 cosponsors, and I look  forward to bringing it to the floor in  the near future.  Again, I want to congratulate Sena tor HATCH for his efforts, and I want  to congratulate the Senate for seeing  to it that justice is done.  COLLEGE WORK  STUDY -COM MUNITY  SERVICE  LEARNING  PROGRAM  ",1990
1059,503,16,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President, the  Department of Education has recently  pledged to me that it will take action  suggested by me to enhance the eff ec tiveness of  the Community Service  Learning Program. This pledge is con sistent with the President's professed  interest in promoting voluntary serv ice in our communities and I am de lighted to report it to my Senate col leagues.  The Community Service Learning  Program is one component of the Col lege Work Study Program. Most stu dents who participate  in  the Work  Study Program work for the colleges  and universities that they attend. But,  under the Work Study Program the  college or university may place its stu dents in a Community Service Learn ing Program designed to develop, im prove,  or  expand  services  for  low income  individuals  and  families,  to  solve particular programs related  to  the needs of  low-income  individuals.  The college or university may use up  to 10 percent of its work study funds  for this program. This is the Commu nity Service Learning Program.  The Work Study Program is a pro gram  that  includes  a matching  re quirement. Colleges and universities  that participate in the program are re quired to contribute 25 percent of the  compensation of the student, a match ing requirement that rises to 30 per cent for 1990-91. But, with the Com munity Service Learning component  of the program, the share that must  be paid by the college and university is  only 10 percent.  Many students participating in the  Community Service Learning Program  are employed by local, private sector,  nonprofit community service organiza tions. When this is the case, colleges  and universities are required to insist  that the community service organiza tion pay the part of the student's compensation that is not covered by the  Federal  payment.  In  addition,  the  community service organization must  pay the employer's share of Social Se curity taxes or workman's compensa tion.  It has come  to my attention that  some colleges and universities have re quired that the community service or ganization pay an additional amount  that would,  in effect,  subsidize  the  fringe benefits of the college or uni versity paid to its employees who are  not participating in a work study pro gram. This additional payment corre sponds to the cost of the fringe bene fits that the university pays to its em ployees, an overhead cost.  On March 20 of this year I wrote to  Education Secretary Cavazos  to  in quire whether this additional payment  requirement  is appropriate.  I  asked  why a college or university should be  able to impose this additional payment  if the fringe benefits that are involved  are not being paid to the work study  student.  I said that this additional payment  would  reduce  the utilization of  the  Community Service Learning Program  as it would raise the cost of the pro gram to the community service that  would employ the students participat ing in the Service Learning Program.  On June 6, Secretary Cavazos  re sponded to my inquiry by stating that,  ""An institution is not authorized to re quire such excess matching amounts that force a community service organi zation to make payments that subsi dize the fringe benefits of the institu tions-non-CWSP-employees-as  a  means of covering the costs of fringe  benefits of its other employees.""  In a second letter of July 17, Larry  Oxendine, Director of the Division of  Policy  and  Program Development,  pledged that the Department of Edu cation would exercise  its administra tive responsibilities by issuing a ""Dear  Colleague""  letter  to  the  institutions  participating in the work study pro gram  reminding  ""the  financial  aid  community of the work study match ing requirements and limitations, par ticularly with respect  to community  service organizations.""  This is welcome news from the De partment of Education. We should do  all that we can to encourage utiliza tion of the Community Service Learn ing Program. This  information from  the  Department  should  end  the  misuse of the work study matching re quirements and increase the number  of  community  service  organizations  that will employ students in communi ty service projects.  The issue I have raised here is relat ed to the pending national service leg islation. The Senate version of this bill  would eliminate the matching require ment  for  the Community  Service  Learning Program. Section 221 of S.  ",1990

1065,516,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Indiana.  ,1990
1066,516,16,Mr. COATS.," Mr. President, I would  like to make two points. The question  has come up relative to the availability  of military transport if a woman deter mines that a safe abortion cannot be  obtained in the place of station some where in the world.  Obviously, we have concerns about  our military personnel being stationed  in places where medical care  is not  adequate for their purposes. I want to  repeat that in response to my direct  question yesterday, the Department of  the other  Defense has replied categorically that  no woman, no dependent  stationed  anywhere in the world, has ever been  denied leave for the purpose of obtain ing an abortion, or space on a military  airlift to a place of her choosing for an  abortion. So  that argument  simply  should not be used as a basis for Sena tors deciding to support the amend ment that is before us.  Second, those of us who support the  pro  life position do understand and  have compassion for those cases which  place mothers in a very difficult situa tion. That is a difficult question that,  as the Senator from Colorado said, has  to be debated and argued; it should be  debated at length on this floor.  But  let us understand  the Wirth  amendment also presents some diffi cult situations in cases on the other  side of  the coin. By allowing unre stricted abortion at any time in the  pregnancy, it raises some very extreme  questions. It raises the issue whether  or not this body wants to establish a  policy that would allow a military de pendent to use taxpayer-financed fa cilities  to perform abortions beyond  the age of viability; to perform abor tions in the ninth month; to perform  abortions  for sexual choice, because  the mother does not like the sex of  the child; for any reason whatsoever. I  suggest that is an extreme response to  a problem that is basically not proper ly before us this morning.  ",1990
1067,516,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Who  yields  time? The Senator from New  Hampshire.  ,1990
1068,516,16,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President, I  yield myself such time as I require.  I  thank the Senator from Indiana  for pointing out once again that no  member of the armed services and no  dependent of a member of the armed  services  seeking  leave  in  order  to  secure  an  abortion  has  ever  been  denied  such  leave,  and  that  no  member of the Armed Forces or de pendent of a member of the Armed  Forces seeking to travel aboard mili tary aircraft for the purpose of secur ing an abortion elsewhere has ever  been denied.  It is important to say that. Because  no case has been made here today by  the proponents of this amendment for  a change in policy.  It is  true, of course,  the Senator  from Colorado [Mr. WIRTH] cited one  hard  case. But, Mr. President, we  cannot make policy, as every Senator  appreciates, on the basis of a few hard  cases. No case has been made.  The Department of Defense does  not want to change policy; opposes the  Wirth amendment. The Secretary op poses  it,  the Assistant Secretary for  Health, who  is  charged  above  all  others with the health and well-being  of the members of our Armed Forces  and their dependents, does not want a  change in policy. Why? Is it because  they are by nature intransigent, or is  it because they see no need, they see  no cause? Well, obviously  it  is  the  latter, because no case has been made  on this floor.  I  thank my colleague the Republi can Senator  from Colorado  for his  contribution  to  the debate; wise, as  always,  temperate and  insightful.  I  likewise thank him for his willingness  to off er with me further amendments  to  clarify  the  intent of  this body  should  the Wirth  amendment  be  adopted.  Mr. President, I will reserve the re mainder of my time. I know the Re publican leader wants to speak on this  matter briefly.  I will  reserve  some  time.  ",1990

1070,516,16,Mr. WIRTH.," Mr. President, I yield  myself such time as I many consume.  Mr. President, the arguments from  those who  oppose  the  amendment  have some interesting inconsistencies.  The argument has been made  that  somehow the military-although they  did it for 9 years prior to 1988-cannot  account  for how much an abortion  costs.  I would be embarrassed if I were the  Secretary of Defense to know his De partment is making that argument. No  wonder  they have accounting prob lems  and  procurement  scandals,  if  they cannot add up simple costs.  The argument  is made that some how we allow people to be transported  on military planes to go someplace else  to have an abortion. Yet they say we  cannot have any public financing for  abortion.  Mr. President, what is transporting  somebody to have an abortion? Is that  transport not occurring on military  aircraft paid for by the taxpayers? Of  course it is, Mr. President.  The  inconsistencies  continue. The  argument  is made  that nobody has  ever been denied leave to go have an  abortion. I never argued that anybody  had been denied leave to have an abor tion. The argument is made that there  have been no complaints on this issue.  Well, I read a very eloquent and very  moving letter. To suggest that there  are no complaints is absolutely untrue.  The  record  is  replete.  I have made  that case over and over again.  The argument  is made  that there  have been no legal challenges. Why in  the world should  there have  to be  legal challenges  from people whose  career is in the military or whose de pendents are worried about endanger ing the career of their spouse who is in  the military? It does not make any  sense whatsoever.  On  the  issue of airlift and airlift  availa.bility, the Senator from Oregon  was absolutely eloquent.

I would propose using that money to  cover the cost of my amendment.  I  hope the SDI amendment passes, but  even if it does not, there will be other  amendments that will free up funds  that could be applied to the cost of  paying  for  the military pay  raise.  Therefore,  I  urge my colleagues  to  join me in supporting fair compensa tion to our men and women in uniform  by voting for this amendment.  Mr.  President,  Senator McCAIN  wanted a few minutes. I think Senator  KENNEDY can finish his statement in a  couple of minutes.  ",1990

1079,529,16,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  thank the Senator from Ohio.  I commend the Senator from Ohio  and urge our colleagues  to support  this measure. As we are going to be re structuring the military forces of our  country  to meet  the current  chal lenges which we are facing today that  are considerably different from what  we were facing some years ago, it is  imperative, I believe, that we do not  lose the competence and the determi nation and the skill of the members of  the military forces.  It ought to be very, very clear to  them, on measures of financial securi ty and support for the wide range of  different family issues, that we here in  the Senate and in Congress are going  to indicate our strong support. Quite  clearly, the issue of compensation, of  just keeping level, is one of the most  basic and fundamental of those ques tions.  I  I think the amendment is correct on  the basis of equity in demonstrating  our concern to them that they not be  placed at a further disadvantage be cause of increases in inflation. We are  going to be facing these kinds of issues  all along the way as we restructure our  forces.  I commend the Senator from Ohio  for recognizing  this. Whether it has  been  this  issue,  the child care pro gram, or the educational benefit pro gram, the Senator from Ohio has been  there on these issues.  I  think  it  is  important  that  the  Senate speak very clearly in support of  this measure because of the message  that it sends not only to the pockets  and pocketbooks of the members of  the Armed Forces but it is a strong  and important message that we intend  to stand by them. They are, after all,  the backbone of the security of our  Nation.  So I thank the Senator from Ohio. I  urge my  colleagues  to  support  the  amendment.  ",1990

1086,529,16,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President,  the  distinguished Senator  from Georgia  [Mr. NUNN] and I have to oppose this  amendment. We do so because the Sec retary of Defense has made  it un equivocally  clear,  by  letter  to  the  Senate, of his objections. I would like  to read the letter, dated August 2.  DEAR MR.  CHAIRMAN:  The  President's  FY91 budget request included a 3.5 percent  military pay raise which supports the De partment's long term objective to keep mili tary pay and allowances comparable to pri vate sector compensation. We believe 3.5  percent  is  the  appropriate  increase  for  FY91.  The House Armed Services Committee in cluded a 4.1 percent military pay increase in  the FY91 Defense Authorization bill recent ly reported out of committee. The addition al cost  in 1991,  for active duty members  alone, would be $314 million. The  total  budgetary impact of the increase is not re stricted to basic military compensation. It  also drives increases in the retired pay ac crual fund, reserve pay, and certain special  pays, and will create significant increased  costs in the future.  My goal is to reduce the size of the force  to meet changing requirements, but to do so  in a deliberate manner, without causing an  unncessary increase in involuntary separa tions. Unfortunately, when operating under  current fiscal constraints, an increase in the  proposed FY91 pay  raise  would  require  additional  strength.  to 4.1  offsets  percent  in  end  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask the  Senate consider this will not become a  conf erenceable  item,  if  the Senate  were  to adopt this amendment. The  Senate conferees' hands would be tied.  It would become law, and they would  then be compelled to go further into  the end strength reduction. For those  reasons we have to oppose it.  ",1990

1089,529,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from Arizona is recognized.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President,  I am  pleased to cosponsor this amendment  along with the distinguished chairman  of the Manpower Subcommittee of the  Armed Services Committee. Senator  GLENN has displayed his leadership on  this, and many other issues,  in this  very difficult time of transition.  Mr. President, we are undergoing a  period of unprecedented transition in  the history of the men and women of  the armed services. We are, for the  first time telling men and women who  have decided to make the military a  career, and who are all volunteers,  that their services will no longer be  needed. Some 100,000 to 150,000 men  and women will be separated from the  service during the next year, many of  them in an involuntary fashion.  Mr. President, if we go to the mili tary bases, the ships, and the other es tablishments  that  compose our de fense establishment, we find this tur bulence in our manpower policy causes  enormous  uncertainty,  tremendous  concern, and all of which  is under standable. These men and women no  longer can predict their futures and  we have added insult to injury by fail ing to give them a pay raise which is  sufficient to keep up with inflation.  This failure is part of a 7-year record  of letting pay fall behind inflation. It  is a failure which has resulted, as Sen ator GLENN stated, in an 11.2-percent  real  decrease  in military  incomes  during that period.  Mr. President, I do not intend to de scribe the demographics of our mili tary establishment in detail. Let me  point out, however, that most of our  military are not colonels or generals,  but young men and women. Many  have  families. Many are single par ents. Most have great difficulty in sur viving in today's economy, having ex perienced a real decrease in their in comes over the past few years.  I might add that most of our men  and women believed, when they volun teered for the military, that their pay  ",1990
1090,542,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Hawaii CMr. INOUYE].  ,1990
1091,542,16,Mr.  INOUYE.," Mr. President,  it  is  very difficult to add much to the wise  words of my friends from Texas and  from Maine. But I would just like to  make an observation and also a  re minder to all of us. I note that history  was invoked which suggested the vul nerability of the battleship.  Mr. President, it is true that, on De cember 7, 1941, five battleships were  sunk. Proud ships and thousands of  lives were lost. One was in drydock. To  suggest that the drydocked battleship  was ready for action is stretching it a  bit too far. The other four had men  lining up for breakfast. It was a sneak  attack. No one expected  the attack.  But after December 7, not a  single  U.S. battleship was sunk during the  Second World War.  I presume that most of us here are  not old enough to recall the battles of  World War II. But ask those who par ticipated in the landing in Saipan, or  Tarawa, or Kwajalein, or Leyte Gulf,  or Luzon. They will tell you that with out the battleships they would have  had a much tougher time. Ask the Ma rines. I  think we should remind our selves, it is not nostalgia.  Yesterday, all of us with grandilo quence spoke up  for  the  resolution  condemning Iraq. I  think we should  remind ourselves on what we said at  that time. Those were eloquent words  speaking of the brutality and the un conscionable action taken by Saddam  Hussein, and we said: ""Appeasement  or cooperation will not constrain the  threat Iraq now poses to the security  of nations throughout the entire Per sian Gulf,"" and we suggested that the  President of the United States should  take into account all possibilities from  sanctions  to blockade. But then we  ended the whole resolution by saying:  If such measures prove  inadequate  to  secure Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, addi tional multilateral actions      involving  air, sea, and land forces as may be needed to  maintain or restore international peace and  security in the region should be employed.  Then we speak of experts before this  crisis occurred. On April 5, Admiral  Trost, the former Chief of Naval Oper ations, strongly supporting these bat tleships  testified before my Subcom mittee on Defense, said:  I  am opposed  to decommissioning any  (battleships) because     they continue to  play a significant role in our efforts to pro",1990

1105,555,16,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr.  President,  I  thank the distinguished floor manag er. I want to say, first of all, everybody  in this body knows that bases have to  be closed. But that is not the debate  here. The debate is, No. 1, are those  bases going to be closed in accordance  with a 5-year projected force structure  which the bill now requires? Are they  going  to be similiarly closed by  the  Secretary, or what kind of equity and  fairness is there going to be?  Mr. President, I have the utmost re spect for the Secretary of Defense, but  when the Senator from Delaware says  that the Secretary of Defense ought  to have the right to close bases that  will cost 1,000 people their jobs or re align  a  base  that  could cost  2,500  people their jobs, that is a lot of power  in one man.  You might trust Dick Cheney to do  that but you might not trust Caspar  Weinberger or vice versa. And every body in this body knows that when a  base closes in his State, as the Senator  from Illinois suffered last year, it is a  traumatic event. You are dealing with  human lives and people's livelihood. I  think it is too much power to put in  one person.  And if I were the Secretary, I would  not want it. I would want the right to  submit to Congress some input into it.  The Base Closing Commission under  Secretary Carlucci did not work to the  advantage of the Senator from Illinois  but it worked to my advantage because  a base in my State that we were wor ried about was not closed. But I will  say this, if Eaker Air Force Base had  been on the list, I would have been  upset because of the economic and en vironmental impact of the closing of  the base, but at least I could have said,  these are honorable men.  My distinguished former colleague,  Tom Eagleton, was on that Base Clos ing Commission, Abe Ribicoff was on  it, whose integrity was unimpeachable.  I could at least say this is not a politi cal decision. This is not a decision to  punish a Member of Congress.  You cannot close a base anywhere at  all and keep a Senator or a Congress man whose district or State that base  is  located  in happy. Scoop Jackson  used to say to me ""I wish I did not  have a military base in my State. You  get no credit for getting one. You take  all the flak if you lose one.""  Do  you  know  that  the  ordinary  standard size air base has 300 civilian  employees and 3,500 airmen. So you  are giving the Secretary carte blanche  on a lot of air bases and other bases in  this country.  I do not want him  to  have it.  I would ask my distinguished friend  from Delaware how he would,  if he  were me-and I ask this not as a rhe torical question but a question that I  would like for the Senator from Dela ware  to  respond  to-when  I  go  to  Blytheville, AR, I would like to take  the Senator from Delaware with me.  It is a city of 25,000-30,000 fine citi zens, where Eaker Air Force Base is lo cated. Secretary Cheney  announced  earlier this year he wanted to close it.  We have discovered of the 21 bases af fecting 44,000 employees that the Sec retary sent us earlier this year, 99 per cent of the jobs lost are in Democratic  districts. I can tell you that mathemat ically the chances of that happening  by coincidence is 244 to 1.  Let me  further say  to my distin guished friend from Delaware that of  the 14 bases that have realignments,  all of those jobs, 88 percent of those  realignments where  they  take men  and  airplanes  and  equipment  from  these bases in Democratic congression al districts and move them, 88 percent  of them go to Republican districts.  So I ask the Senator from Delaware,  how would he answer the folks in Mis sissippi County about whether ~here  was any politics involved in this oase closing proposal or not? Could  the  Senator answer that?  (Ms.  MIKULSKI  chair.)  ",1990
1106,555,16,Mr. ROTH.," Well, of course, I would  point out to my distinguished friend, I  think we all agree that the closing of  bases should not be done on a political  basis. But I would have to point out  that I  suppose  in today's world, be cause there are more Democratic conassumed  the  gressional districts than Republicans,  it is natural that in a close-down more  Democratic  districts would  be  in volved.  ",1990
1107,555,16,Mr. BUMPERS.," Senator, not 99 to 1.  ",1990
1108,555,16,Mr. ROTH.," Well,  of  course,  the  other side is that, traditionally, more  money went into those districts.  But let me say  this  to  the distin guished Senator. If we find the crite ria collected by the Secretary to be  reasonable and in the best interest of  the Government, we should be willing  to accept the fair application of that  criteria across the length and breadth  of the Department of Defense. If we  find the criteria to be lacking, then we  should demand that they be reviewed  and reconsidered.  ",1990
1109,555,16,Mr. BUMPERS.," Let me ask the Sen ator this question. Secretary Cheney is  a Republican; he is a former Republi can House Member. That  is  just  hunky-dory with me. He was appoint ed by the President. I thought he was  a  very  able House Member,  and  I  think he is an able Secretary of De fense. We have our differences, natu rally.  But when he came before the Appro priations Subcommittee, I asked him, I  said, ""Mr. Secretary, let us change po sitions. Let us put me down there as  Secretary of Defense, as a Republican,  and you as a Democratic Senator sit ting in my position, and I will tell you  that I  just got  through announcing  the closing or realignment of 35 bases,  99 percent of the 44,000 jobs lost will  be  in Republican congressional dis tricts, and 8 percent of the realign ments will go to Democratic districts.  Would you have any trouble believing  that that had been determined by a  computer  programming  system  or  something?""  He just smiled. He did not answer  that. There is not any answer to that.  And as I say, I really hate to put this  on this basis. But I  think the Base  Closing Commission,  for  all  of  its  flaws, at least gave somebody a little  cover.  The answer to the question I asked  you a moment ago, I say to the Sena tor,  is when you go  to Mississippi  County  and when  you  tell  those  people, where not hardly a house has  sold since the announcement that base  would be closed because  their  total  economy  is dependent on that base,  the answer  is you cannot  tell  them  anything, except, yes,  it is blatantly  probably political and I am certainly  sorry about it, but there is nothing I  can do about that. There is not any thing I can do. But I can tell you there  is something I am going to try to do. I  am going to try to get this body to  adopt the same amendment that the  House has adopted to try to do this in  a  fair, equitable, military, economic,  environmental basis.  ",1990

Of the amounts appropriated pursuant to  section 201, not more than $77,000,000 may  be obligated for research, development, test,  and evaluation in connection with the kinet ic energy anti-satellite <ASAT) program.  ",1990
1122,581,16,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I send  this amendment to the desk on behalf  of myself, Senator BUMPERS, and the  distinguished Chair.  This is a different amendment from  the amendment on antisatellite weapons that we have debated on the floor  of the Senate in previous years. In pre vious years we have discussed a mora torium on testing. This has nothing to  do with moratorium on testing. It has  nothing to do with the moratorium. It  is not a restraint on the satellite pro gram per se. It is a restraint on the  speed with which the development and  research program  is currently being  undertaken.  Mr. President,  last year we  spent  some $73 million for the development  of an Asat system, antisatellite weap ons system. This year the mark in the  committee bill at this moment is $208  million but  the distinguished chair man has indicated that he is in agree ment that $49 million of that is  in  excess at this point because the Army  has reduced from two contractors to  one contractor.  So there is already $49 million that  you could draw back from  the $208  million. My amendment would bring  the spending for the development of  the antisatellite weapons system back  to last year's level plus inflation.  The reason for that ought to be very  very clear  to every Member of  the  Senate. We  are  cutting  countless  weapons systems. We have cut Milstar.  We have cut in the course of the com mittee proceedings countless systems  which we funded over the years. This  is a research program. It is a develop ment program.  It is a development  program in an area where clearly the  Soviet Union we know has not tested  in 8 years,  and has a  rudimentary  system.  It  is evident  from  the CIA  briefings  and  the  private  briefings  that this is not something that at this  moment in time given developments in  Europe and the Soviet Union remains  a frontline priority of the country.  I am not suggesting that this money  be taken out of the defense budget. I  am not suggesting that the money be  transferred for another specific pur pose within the budget. I am merely  suggesting  that  this money  be  re strained in the rate of spending for  this program.  This is the largest single increase in  a research and development program  in the entire military budget; 181 per cent.  Mr. President, there is simply no ra tionale for that. The simple reality is  that if you look at the deputy program  manager's own statements you could  even question  the  rationale  for  the  system in the first place.  But  I  am not suggesting  that we  should not continue to research. The  distinguished Senator from Wyoming  will no doubt take the floor and point  out that the Soviet Union has con ducted research in other areas. I ac knowledge that. That is not in conten tion here.  Yes,  they have conducted that re search. But the question is do we need  in the face of changes in the Soviet  Union and  in  the face of what has  happened in Europe to prepare for a  war-fighting strategy against satellites  of the Soviet Union in a headlong rush  to  deployment  at  this  particular  moment in time? I do believe we ought  to research adequately so that we pre vent Soviet breakout in this field, and  $77 million does  that.  I  believe we  ought  to continue the research pro gram in an adequate fashion to main tain the possibilities of the future, and  $77 million does that.  But there are countless programs in  the defense budget today that are not  only not getting last year's budget, let  alone  plus  inflation,  but  they  are  being cut in real terms.  Mr. President, I suggest respectfully  that for those who have been clamor ing about the deficit, clamoring about  the budget, and raising a hue and cry  about  a  budget  from  the  defense  markup that does not even meet the  budget mark, this is an opportunity to  restrain spending, and  in a  sensible  and responsible way.  I am not even going to go into the  issues of the realities of this program  which  I  think  are  legitimate  and  ought to cause some people concern  about this rate of expenditure. When  you have the deputy program manager  himself saying:  ""When you examine Asat and war game it, you reach a point where you  say, well,  if we have started to take  out  each  other's satellites  to  this  degree, nukes are flying. Your sensors  and  their sensors get nuked and  it  breaks down.""  What they are saying is, quoting the  former Asat Chief, John Petroski, he  said ""it is OK to the level of theater  nuclear war.""  Well, Mr. President, where  in  the  world at  this particular moment  is  there such a  threat requiring a 181percent increase because of the poten tial of a theater nuclear war? It is un realistic  for us  to be spending  that  kind of money.  We have  even  taken our bomber  force off the 24-hour alert for the first  time in 25 years. It seems to me that  at this particular moment, when we  are about to see West Germany spend ing money to subsidize Soviet troops  staying in East Germany for a period  of time, it is extraordinary to me that  we are going to be spending money to  supposedly ward off an  increase  in  threat from the very people the West  Germans are supporting, when we are  supporting  the West Germans with  our own troop forces in West Germa ny.  It seems to me that if we limited the  funding, then this money could go to  sensible programs. We can put it into  the high altitude reconnaissance. We  can put it into increasing funding for  efforts to boost responsive launch ca pabilities, to research for the DARPA  ",1990
1123,607,16,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President,  I  have heard from the learned Senator  from Maine  the suggestion  that he  and  the chairman, next year. next  Congress, hold open public hearings  on this subject, and that we discuss all  these matters. This seems to me a very  useful approach. That was  the ap proach we took 13 years ago. A very  close vote was the result.  I wonder if my cosponsor, the Sena tor  from  Pennsylvania, would  not  agree that this was more than satisfac tory  outcome  at  this  point;  that  having this agreement we could take  down the measure.  ",1990
1124,607,16,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, if this  colloquy sounds scripted,  I certainly  would not want to appear to be the  cause. But I think that the suggestions  my colleagues would be a good resolu tion to this issue because it is compli cated, it is involved, and there ought  to be hearings.  If I might, while having the floor  just for another moment or so, dis agree respectfully with the very distin guished vice chairman. It is true that  one number will not tell everything,  but it will show a proportion of intelli gence to other defense matters. It will  show a proportion of  intelligence  to  the  overall  budget,  and  therefore  there will be a picture as to how the  intelligence budget changes from year  to year. So some information will be  useful.  It may be, as suggested, this will just  be a starting point. It is not a commit ment. But it is not unusual to raise an  amendment in this form and then to  move to the next step: to have hear ings. I think that is a very constructive  result, especially one at which we ar rived in a fairly brief period of time. In  light of the hour and the interest of  the Members to move on to other mat ters, I yield the floor.  ",1990
1125,607,16,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President,  I am  very pleased to hear the comments of  my two colleagues, the cosponsors of  this amendment. I might say I think  the colloquy and the expression of dif fering views that we have just heard in  summary form between  the Senator  from  Pennsylvania  and  the  distin guished vice chairman,  the Senator  from Maine, indicates why this matter  is a very serious one that merits the  attention  that can be given  in  the  proper forum at the proper time.  There are, indeed, competing argu ments  that  need  to  be  carefully  weighed in this matter and thought fully considered and  I  believe  in a  forum in which that is the sole focus  of the discussion, as opposed to the sit uation in which we find ourselves to night.  So I appreciate the suggestion of the  Senator from New York and the Sena tor  from  Pennsylvania  that  the  amendment might be drawn down to night.  I again reiterate our pledge to hold  hearings, including open public hear ings on this matter. I invite not only  the input of the distinguished Senator  from New York and, of course, our  current member of the committee, the  Senator from Pennsylvania, but also  other Members of the body, as well as  others who have experience  in  this  field outside of Government, former  members of Government and academ ics that we can bring in to discuss this  matter.  It would be my hope we could do so  in a very full and complete way.  I thank my colleagues for the indica tion of their willingness to allow us to  consider it in that form.  ",1990
1126,607,16,Mr. EXON.," May I ask a question of  the chairman of the committee.  I have been listening with great in terest to this debate. I get the feeling  it is unanimous among the leadership  of the committee that this total figure  should be made public.  I am not a  member of  the committee.

1129,607,16,Mr. BOREN.,"  I have  indicated we  would hold hearings. It has been 13  years since we examined this issue.

I certainly would be willing to have  an open mind, to have a full discus sion, and to do so on an impartial basis  to try to determine the right way to  proceed.  indicated to the Senator from  New York, I do not believe tonight, as  we have our attention diverted to the  pending bill, would be  the  time  to  make a change in policy of this magni tude.  ",1990

1131,607,16,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr.  President,  may I simply make  two points. The  first  is  that the amendment offered  refers only to outlays and not to au thorizations,  having  very much  in  mind the question of the bubble which  has been suggested as a problem.  In 1977, Admiral Turner specifically  suggested it was not a problem  In any event, we have an agreement  to hold public hearings on an impor tant subject.  I would like to make the final point  that those who are concerned for the  intelligence community would be  in terested to know if it was being cut in  half without their knowledge, just as  others would be interested to know if  it was being doubled without  their  knowledge.  So, Mr. President, with the agree ment of my distinguished cosponsor, I  would  ask  that  the amendment be  withdrawn and express the gratitude  of Senator SPECTER and myself to Sen ator BOREN.  the chairman, and Sena tor Co HEN,  the vice chairman, of the  select committee.

",1990
1149,633,16,Mr. WILSON.," Mr. President,  this  amendment has been cleared on both  sides.  Mr. President, all of us are only too  aware that many of our Nation's mili tary  installations have serious prob lems with environmental contamina tion. Maintenance cleaning of military  machinery at a number of these bases  has resulted  in ground water pollu tion, and in some cases the contami nated ground water plume threatens  drinking water supplies of nearby resi dential areas.  We need to ensure that these prob lems are addressed, and we cannot tol erate  any  unreasonable  delay. My  amendment is a very straight! orward  attempt  to  eliminate  delay  in  the  cleanup at these  installations, and I  would respectfully suggest to my col leagues that it is an amendment which  deserves their support.  Very simply, my amendment would  require the Department of Defense to  accelerate  the process by which  it  enters into cleanup agreements with  the Environmental Protection Agency  once a military installation has been  proposed to be listed on the National  Priorities List under  the Superfund  statute. The  amendment would  re quire such agreements to be executed  within 1 year after the proposal to list.  Now  the Defense Department al ready has a duty  to execute  these  agreements under existing  law. The  problem  is  that  it has been  taking  DOD as many as 4 or 5 years after its  installations are proposed for inclusion  on the National Priorities List to con clude such agreements. Frankly, that  is much too long. It delays cleanups  that  are  necessary  to  protect  the  public health and environment, and it  cannot be tolerated.  Let me note here that this is hardly  a matter of concern only to my State  of California. This National Priorities  List is a list of the most contaminated  sites in the country. Last year at this  time, nearly 90 military installations  from some 24 States were on that list.  Those States included Alaska, Arizona,  Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho,  Kansas, Massachusetts, Maine, Minne sota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New  Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,  Rhode  Island, South Carolina, Ten nessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia,  and Wyoming.  And as  if  that  list was not  long  enough, EPA  then proposed  to add  roughly 50 more military bases to that  list. So this problem is a large one, and  it is growing.  California, unfortunately, has had to  deal with at least 20 of these installa tions that are on the NPL, and the  progress has been excruciatingly slow.  Norton Air Force Base was first pro posed for listing on the NPL in Octo ber 1984-but the interagency agree ment between DOD and EPA wasn't  concluded  until  June  1989. Sharpe  Army Depot also was proposed  for  NPL  listing  in October  1984-but,  again, the interagency agreement was  not completed until 1989. The Naval  Air Station at Offutt Field was pro posed for inclusion on the list in April  1985, and DOD and EPA were still ne gotiating the interagency agreement 4  years later.  Mr. President, 4 years' delay in exe cuting these agreements is simply too  long. These military bases  that are  contaminating drinking water supplies  must be cleaned up promptly. That is  why I am offering this amendment. It  is a needed amendment, it protects the  public health, and it furthers the goals  of our environmental laws that are al ready on the books-not only Super fund but also  the Defense environ mental restoration account that is the  source of DO D's money for cleaning  up these installations.  And again, this is a very straightfor ward amendment. It simply takes the  existing duty of the Defense Depart ment  to  execute  these  agreements,  and requires that the agreement proc ess be concluded within 1 year of the  time any particular military base  is  ",1990
1150,659,16,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President, the im portance of immediate reforms to pre vent continuing abuses of expired ap propriations accounts cannot be  ig nored. When I was a member of the  business  community,  I  have  often  heard it said, that ""if the Government  were  only  run  like  a  business we  wouldn't have these problems."" Gov ernment and business are very different, and I know that the private sector  is not always a model of good manage ment. However a common bond in the  management  of  any  organization,  public or private,  is sound financial  management, accurate accounting, re liable information, and of course, ra tional spending practices.  From what we know about expired  appropriations  accounts,  it  is  clear  that we have has failed to meet these  fundamental management standards.  Today's amendment is a product of a  bipartisan  effort  to  restore  some  sanity and accountability to this proc ess. Senators GLENN, ROTH,  PRYOR,  GRASSLEY, and I recognized that Con gress must act to protect the integrity  of appropriations and stem the poten tial growth of the Federal deficit. This  amendment does so while preserving  the  flexibility  of  agencies  to  find  emergencies, meet unanticipated justi fied costs, and make necessary adjust ments.  I have been pleased to work  with my colleagues to address issues of  such importance to the Nation.  This amendment dismantles a  ""fi nancial formula for failure""  in agen cies ranging from the Department of  Defense where  the expired accounts  funds are over $18 billion, to the De partment of Agriculture where it is an  estimated $183 million. The General  Accounting Office  has  determined  that a total of $28 billion is sitting in  these accounts at 20 Federal offices plus the Executive Office of the Presi dent and independent agencies.  The amendment improves the integ rity of the appropriations process, sets  controls on the use of Federal funds,  restricts access by agencies  so  that  funds cannot be applied to unauthor ized or  invalid obligations, and per haps most important requires agencies  to report annually to the Congress and  the President as to the existence and  use of all appropriations accounts.  As chairman of the Subcommittee  on Government Information and Reg ulation, I am bothered by the fact that  we do not know how many expired ac counts exists; we do not know how  much  in  unliquidated  obligations  exists; we do not know how much in  unobligated balances exists. If we are  serious  about  controlling  Federal  spending, then we must have a map to  navigate. Our objective is to lead the  public out of a  financial swamp, not  deeper into one.  IMPROVING CONTROL OF EXPIRED  APPROPRIATIONS ACCOUNTS  ",1990
1151,659,16,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President, for sever al decades, I have been working to im prove government accounting and fi nancial practices. Over the last year, I  have focused on a range of initiatives  including a chief financial officer for  the  Federal Government  and  im proved management of expired appro priations  accounts. Today, Senators  GLENN, GRASSLEY. PRYOR, KOHL, and I  are  proposing  an  amendment  that  makes great strides in clarifying the  Government  accounting  code.  The  amendment that we are proposing im proves the ability of the Department  of Defense as well as the agencies to  efficiently execute programs that we  are authorizing in this bill. It has the  added benefit of preventing a poten tially  uncontrollable  multibillion  dollar increase in the Federal deficit.  Yesterday,  the Governmental Af fairs Committee held hearings on the  issue of government accounting prac tices. It is difficult to shed light on the  bureaucratic  games  in  this  arcane  area. Witnesses  from  the Office of  Management and Budget, the General  Accounting Office, the Department of  Defense deputy inspector general, and  the Department of Defense Comptrol ler testified about their efforts to con trol  long expired spending authority  held in the merged surplus and Mac counts. The DOD  inspector general  described the nightmare they discov ered  in auditing  these accounts. All  presented  suggestions  for  resolving  problems. They also commented on  the bill submitted by Senator GLENN S. 2951-and the bill I submitted with  Senators  GRASSLEY  and  SYMMS-S.  2699. The amendment we are present ing integrates the two bills with rec ommendations from the hearing and  the version of  the ROTH, GRASSLEY,  SYMMS bill approved by  the Senate  Budget Committee on a 19 to 1 vote.  In conjunction with the chairman,  and Senators GRASSLEY, PRYOR,  and  SASSER, I have been engaged in a broad  range of activities to understand and  resolve problems associated with these  accounts. I congratulate my colleagues  on their expeditious efforts in this eso teric area.  OVERVIEW OF M AND MERGED SURPLUS  ACCOUNTS  A lot of people believe that after an  appropriation  expires,  any  unused  spending authority is returned to the  Treasury. However, under the current  law, United States Code, title 31, sec tions 1552 and 1553, ""expired"" only  means that for 2 years following the  period for which Congress authorized  spending, no new contracts can be  written.  Even then the unused spending au thority does not go back to the Treas ury;  it gets  transferred into  two ac counts that have been accumulating  since 1956. One account, called the M  account, contains spending authority  that has been set aside to pay bills on  existing contracts. The other account,  often called a merged surplus, contains  old spending authority that has not  been obligated. The merged surplus  accounts can only be used to supple ment the M account.  At  the working  level, budget ana lysts do not differentiate between the  M and merged surplus accounts. The  practice  is  to spend  the M account  ",1990
1152,672,16,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, it is  ironic that exactly 1 year ago today,  the subcommittee on courts, of which  I am ranking member, held a hearing  on the Senator from Nevada's propos al. That bill, S. 982, was favorably re ported by  the subcommittee, and  is  now pending before  the full Senate  Judiciary Committee.  Tonight, we again pause to consider  the  tragic case of  the hundreds of  thousands of servicemen, civilian Gov ernment workers, employees of private  contractors, and downwind civilians af fected by exposure to radiation as part  of our Government's Atomic Weapons  Testing Program. More than 200,000  people are estimated to be affected.  The proposed solution, again,  is  to  permit these private parties to bring  lawsuits against various Government  contractors. This solution is tempting;  it is billed as a return to the status quo  before passage of the Warner amend ment on the 1985 authorization bill. It  is simple, straightforward, and appeals  to our sense of justice by giving people  ""their day in court.""  The attractiveness of the proposal to  repeal the Warner amendment is dem onstrated by the impressive array of  cosponsors to S. 982. It is a tribute to  the dedicated efforts of those who sin",1990
1153,685,16,Mr. COHEN.," Mr.  President,  the  American health care system provides  the finest, most innovative and tech nologically advanced care in the world.  The latest in diagnostic and therapeu tic hardware is available to Americans  in virtually every region of the coun try. Advances and innovations in tech nology and surgical  technique have  dramatically improved the practice of  medicine and have improved the qual ity of life for millions of Americans.  However, while America's system is ca pable of providing the finest health  care  in  the world,  it  is  critically  flawed. For all of  its sophistication  and technological expertise, our cur rent health care insurance has failed  to fulfill its primary mission to provide  access  to  affordable  quality health  care for all Americans.  As many as 37 million people-at  least one in every eight Americans are without health insurance and are  therefore denied access to even basic  health care.  In my home State of  Maine,  there  are  approximately  130,000  individuals  who  have  no  health insurance at all. They are not  old enough  for Medicare, not poor  enough for Medicaid, and have limited  or no access to health insurance pro vided through their employers. Work ing Americans and their families make  up the great majority-SO percent-of  the uninsured. Many have been denied  coverage because of preexisting medi cal conditions. Most have simply been  priced  out  of  the market. Rising  health costs and government-mandat ed  comprehensive  benefit  packages  have sent health insurance premiums  skyrocketing,  virtually  precluding  small businesses from providing ade quate coverage for their workers and  individuals  and  families  of modest  means from purchasing coverage on  their own.  For the most part, the remaining un insured are unemployed persons and  their families who are near or below  the federally established poverty level,  but who are not covered under Medic aid. In actuality, Medicaid only covers  about 40 percent of Americans who  live below the poverty line.  The problem of access to affordable  health care services is not limited to  the uninsured. The problem of access  is shared by the one-fourth of our Na tion's population who  live  in  rural  areas.  Last year, I presided at a joint hear ing of the Senate and House Aging  Committees  in my  hometown  of  Bangor, ME. Together with my col league  from Maine, Representative  ",1990
1154,698,16,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr.  President,  last  Friday  the Senate  adopted Senate  Resolution 315, expressing the sense  of  the Senate  that President Bush  should provide  relief  to  the Philip pines in the aftermath of the devastat ing July 16 earthquake. I  introduced  both Senate Resolution 315 and an  earlier bill, S. 2883, because the Philip pine people are our oldest allies  in  Asia, and are deserving of our help in  this hour of great need.  Earlier today, I had the privilege of  meeting with the Philippine Secretary  of Finance, who advised me that al though  the  initial  relief efforts are  largely complete, the toughest part of  the job remains. Massive repairs must  be undertaken to put the earthquake damaged regicn back on its feet again.  The death  toll will ultimately reach  several thousand. Property losses are  estimated at $300 million. The Philip pine people are pleading for assistance  in meeting this crisis.  I  understand  the Department  of  State is looking for ways to help fund  the rehabilitation efforts and is con sidering using money available under  the authority of  the Foreign Assist ance Act. I commend the administration for moving to lend assistance to  the Philippines,  but  I would  urge  President Bush to act quiclt.ly to pro vide additional assistance under au thority of the Foreign Assistance Act.  Mr. President, we must bear in mind  the overall  situation  in  the Philip pines. The freely elected Government  faces  many  problems  that  have  strained resources to the limit. Unem ployment  and poverty  remain very  high. The Government must still con tend with  threats from  rural  insur gents and rebel elements of the mili tary. On top of all this, a crushing for eign debt takes up to 40 percent of the  national budget for repayment.  Given these facts, an event like the  recent earthquake  is a heavy body blow that could undermine the stabili ty of the Philippine Government at a  time when it is particularly vulnera ble. It is imperative that the United  States act compassionately and quick ly to provide funding  to one of our  most  trusted allies  in  this  time of  need. I urge my colleagues to join me  in this effort.  THE INVASION OF KUWAIT BY  IRAQ  ",1990
1155,698,16,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. President, should  we be surprised that Saddam Hussein  invaded Kuwait? Should we be sur prised that he stormed out of  talks  with Kuwait, and sent his army rolling  across the Kuwaiti border en route to  Kuwait City?  I am not.  While many of us may not have  thought that President Hussein would  have moved his  troops  into Kuwait  last night, all of us knew he was giving  every indication that he had little pa tience for negotiations. Saddam Hus sein has never been one to negotiate.  Bullies do not negotiate.  His history of finding  justification  for acts of aggression, against  Iran,  against his own Kurdish minority, is  well known. In that sense, Mr. Presi dent, no one should be surprised that  he  found  justification  for  invading  Kuwait.  Saddam Hussein has been amassing  his troops and his weapons stockpiles  for some time in his effort to become  the biggest kid on the block. His coun try is deeply in debt from the Iran Iraq War, and he saw a way to regain  some lost revenues. His motives may  be as bald as that.  His decision to  invade Kuwait is a  breach of international law and should  be condemned by all civilized coun tries.  Anyone with a knowledge of Iraqi af fairs knows that Iraq has engaged in  aggressive behavior for years. In 1982,  my  distinguished  colleague Senator  BoscHWITZ and I spoke on the floor of  this Chamber against the sale of mili tary equipment to Iraq. A number of  ",1990
1156,711,16,Mr.  GARN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  with my colleague from Utah, Senator  HATCH, to introduce legislation to com plete the Central Utah Water Project  CCUPl and to increase the authoriza tion ceiling necessary  to accomplish  that task.  Since the Utah congressional delega tion first introduced the CUP comple tion bill almost 3 years ago, we have  endeavored to craft legislation which  is sensitive to the new realities of the  arid west. We've learned that in order  to build water projects, they must be  cost-efficient, environmentally sound,  and in this case, address the legitimate  needs of Native Americans who are  participants in the project.  Our delegation has negotiated with  our Colorado River Basin State neigh bors, environmental groups  in Utah  and here in Washington, Indian Tribal  representatives, Public Power entities,  farmers, and urban water users. We  have not found reaching an agreement  amongst these disparate groups to be  easy. In fact, negotiations have been  protracted and frustrating. Yet, now,  after some 3 years, we do have a bill  which we think meets all of those tests  which  are demanded of westerners  who want Federal water projects.  First, by having the Central Utah  Water Conservancy District construct  the remaining water delivery features,  the cost of construction can be  re duced substantially. This is borne out  by previous experiences where, with  the district in charge of contracting  authority, construction costs were re duced by over 35 percent from projec tions made by the Bureau of Reclama tion. The bill authorizes completion of  both the municipal and irrigation f ea tures of the CUP.  Second, the bill establishes what the  National Wildlife Federation refers to  as one of, if not the most, aggressive  water conservation plans for the Cen tral Utah project of any conservation  plan in the country. Local water dis tricts  have  embraced  the proposed  plan and  look forward  to stretching  out  the  scarce water  supplies  the  project will provide.  The  legislation requires  local cost sharing for  the  remaining construc tion features at a rate of 35 percent.  This  is  a  substantial  sum  for  the  people of Utah to pay. But, Mr. Presi dent  I  believe  this burden  is  one  Utahns will bear in order to assure an  adequate, long-term water supply for  our State.  Finally, the bill will provide for com pletion of the long neglected environ mental mitigation features associated  with the CUP and as I mentioned ear lier, will honor the Government's com mitments to the Ute Indian Tribe. All in-all, this legislation represents a sub stantial change in approach to water  resource development projects.  I be lieve  it reflects  the  realities of  the  1990's while honoring  the  commit ments made by the Government to the  people of Utah in the 1950s. This Gov ernment will be made to keep its word.  Senator HATCH and I, along with our  three House colleagues, are pleased to  recommend this bill to the Congress  and hope that it will be enacted into  law before the lOlst Congress comes  to an end.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that an explanation of the legisla tion be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  EXPLANATION OF THE CENTRAL UTAH PROJECT  BILL  Section 1. Short Title and Table of Con tents.  Sec. 2.

1157,724,16,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President,  the President's veto of the Family and  Medical Leave Act and the subsequent  failure of the House to override that  veto, while a setback, should not be  seen  as  the end of our efforts  to  ensure that working people are able to  care for their families and meet basic  economic needs.  Today, we  are  reintroducing  the  Family and Medical Leave Act. We are  sending a signal that we stand firmly  behind our Nation's families and our  commitment to enact a comprehensive  and sound family leave policy.  What we are saying with this bill is  simple  justice:  A  single  mother  shouldn't be forced to lose her job to  take care of a dangerously ill child. A  father should be able to count on re turning to work after taking care of  his family's emergency at home.  Fairness in the workplace will pay  off for employers, too. Understanding  the problems  that families  face will  bring dividends  in  the way workers  feel about their work. Instead of losing  valuable productivity on the job, em ployers with  leave policies  in place  report gains in productivity and reten tion of a loyal and experienced work force.  The demographic revolution in the  American work force is having a pro found effect on the lives of working  men and women and  their families.  Today, more than half of the 45.6 mil lion children  in  two-parent  families  have both parents in the work force.  The number of women working out side the home has increased 178 per cent since 1950. More than one-half of  all mothers with infants under 1 year  of age now work outside  the home.  Two-thirds  of mothers  of  children  under the age of 3 work outside the  home.  We are not strangers to these statis tics. We have heard them here before.  It is time we face up to the changing  reality of our economy-single parents  and  two wage-earning parents domi nate the work force. It is time now to  take action, to ensure that no longer  will American workers have  to  face  difficult choices as they seek to bal ance family and workplace responsibil ities. The dual goals of  family and  work are  important  to our Nation's   well-being. It is time we support work ing parents by providing flexible leave  options which promote family stability  and. job security.  The Family and Medical Leave Act  being introduced again today will help  ease the tremendous pressures parents  face  in  balancing  workplace  and  family responsibilities. It is essentially  the same bill passed by the Senate on  June 14  this year. That bill was the  result of months of effort and was a  carefully-tuned  compromise  which  sought to take into consideration the  concerns of business and the needs of  our Nation's working families.  This legislation requires companies  of 50 or more employees to allow their  permanent workers 12 weeks of unpaid  leave per year for the birth of a baby  or serious family illness. Data from my  own State of Oregon, which has a  family  leave  standard of 12 weeks,  finds that businesses have had little  trouble in complying with the stand ard.  Under  this bill, only workers who  have been on the  job for a year or  more and who have worked an average  of half time or more during that year  would be eligible for unpaid leave. Em ployees would be assured of reinstate ment  to  the same or equivalent  job  upon their return, and would continue  to receive health care coverage during  their absence. The General Account ing Office estimates the cost of the  bill to be no more than $188 million  per year, most of which will  result  from the continuation of health insur ance coverage for employees.  This bill is a reasonable approach. It  seeks  to meet  the needs of families  while  helping  businesses  plan  for  workers taking leave. An estimated 95  percent of all firms, those with fewer  than 50 employees, would be exempt  from  the  bill's  requirements.  The  Family and Medical Leave Act is not  antibusiness. Indeed, many firms that  already have  leave policies  in place  report improved employee loyalty, re duced turnover and absenteeism, and  enhanced productivity.  It seems clear that business owners  and their employees will benefit mutu ally from an unpaid leave policy such  as envisioned in this bill.  I urge my  colleagues and  the Nation  to  rally  behind  this  long-overdue  policy  to  help our Nation's families strike a bal ance between the needs of their loved  ones and  the demands of  the work place.e  e Mr~ ADAMS. Mr. President,  I am  outraged  that President Bush  has  vetoed the family and medical leave  bill and terribly disturbed that Con gress did not act to override the Presi dent's actions. I want President Bush  to know that he has not heard the last  from us on this issue. Those of use in  Congress who are profamily and who  want to give working America a help ing hand are going  to continue  the  struggle. The reintroduction today by  Senator Donn of the family and medi cal leave bill sends this message out  loud and clear.  I want my colleague  from Connecticut to know that as an  original cosponsor, I am behind him  all the way.  The family and medical  leave bill  that President Bush vetoed  simply  would have ensured that the mother  or father of a newborn child will have  a period of  time  to bond with that  child after birth and  that working  people in this country will not have to  sacrifice their jobs when their elderly  parents or their children are seriously  ill.  Families of America deserve no less  than required  in  this bill. President  Bush must understand that advocates  of family and medical leave will not let  up until this bill becomes Federal law.  He should also understand that the al ready overwhelming support for this  measure by the American public will  only continue to grow.  If we  cannot as a nation demon strate this kind of compassion for our  Nation's families, then I would like to  know how the President proposes to  face  the  tremendous  social,  demo graphic, and economic challenges we  must meet in the nineties.e  e ",1990
1158,724,16,Mr.  KENNEDY.," Mr.  President,  today I join Senator Donn and others  in introducing a new Family and Medi cal Leave Act. This bill is almost iden tical to the bill passed with solid bipar tisan support in both the House and  the Senate, but vetoed by President  Bush.  Our message in reintroducing a bill  essentially  the  same  as  the vetoed  measure is clear: this issue is not going  away. The President may have violat ed  a  campaign promise  to working  families, but Congress intends to keep  it. The failure to override the veto was  a pyrrhic victory  for  the President.  The cost of his accommodation of the  business lobby is the denial of funda mental fairness to working Americans.  Family and medical leave is too im portant to be left to the whim of man agement. President Bush, in his veto  message, tried to explain his action by  objecting to Government mandates of  employee benefits. He claims that the  bill ""ignores  the realities of  today's  workplace, and the diverse needs of  workers"". But it is the President who  is  ignoring  the demographics of the  1990's. Women and mothers are work ing  in  record  numbers-some  by  choice-some by economic necessity and it is time to recognize this chang ing reality of the workplace.  Time off to care for a new baby or a  child or parent who is seriously ill is  not just another employee benefit. It  is a basic protection for workers faced  with a family emergency, not a benefit  that can be chosen in advance.  The amount of family leave provided  in the bill is already made available by  many employers. Since  the  leave  is  unpaid,  the cost to business  is mini mal.  Senator DODD and I intend to do all  we can, with or without the President,  to see  that reasonable and  realistic  family  leave  becomes  available  for  American workers. Just as workers de serve other statutory protections rang ing from Social Security to workplace  ",1990
1159,737,16,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to introduce legislation that will  help ease the tax burden of middle class  homeowners  throughout  the  country, by allowing an income tax de duction for user fees and water and  sewer services.  Many State and local municipalities  are faced with cleanup efforts like the  one now confronting my home State  of Massachusetts. Under  a  Federal  court mandate, Massachusetts  has  begun the task of cleaning up Boston  Harbor, and I am proud to say the  State has met  the enormity of  this  challenge head on. The Massachusetts  Water Resources Authority, created to  head the cleanup of Boston Harbor,  will  soon become  the  largest bond  39-059 0-91-24 (Pt. 16)  issuer in the country. It will pay off  the  bonds  through  revenue  raised  from user  fees on water and sewer  services.  The cost of the cleanup will not be  cheap, and the Bush administration,  despite its 'rhetoric of the 1988 cam paign, has not proposed one dime for  the cleanup of Boston Harbor. As a  result, State and  local governments  have been hard pressed for additional  revenues and have raised user fees on  water and sewer services to raise the  necessary funds to come into compli ance with Federal water  standards.  These user fees have increased signifi cantly in the past couple of years and  have  hit middle-class  homeowners  hard. In Massachusetts, user fees on  water  and  sewer  services  have  in creased by 70 percent over the past 3  years. In the city of Boston, a house hold of four now pays $600 a year in  water and sewer user  fees, and  the  rates are expected to reach well over  $1,000 in 5 years.  Massachusetts is not the only State  facing the financial problems of com plying with Federal water standards.  Sioux Falls, SD and parts of New York  State,  to name  a  few,  face  similar  problems. As America faces the chal lenge of cleaning up polluted  rivers  and contaminated water supplies, user  fees on water and sewer services will  certainly increase across the country.  Therefore, I believe this legislation is  critically important if we are to meet  the challenges of environmental clean up and ease the tremendous burden it  places on middle-class homeowners.  Traditionally, the moneys raised for  cleanup efforts  in  these areas have  come from  local real property taxes,  which are  tax deductible. However,  many  local  and State governments  have been  forced  to use alternative  methods, such as user fees on water  and sewer services,  to raise the reve nue for these projects. Therefore, I be lieve the Tax Code should reflect this  change and allow for local water and  sewer fees to be deductible in the same  manner as local real property taxes.  This bill has been introduced in the  House by Congressman DONNELL y.  I  urge my colleagues to join me in sup porting this legislation, which provides  significant tax relief for middle-class  homeowners while maintaining our  commitment  to environmental clean up.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the bill be print ed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 2986  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That Ca)  subsection Cb) of section 164 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by redes ignating paragraphs <3>  and <4>  as paragraphs (4) and (5), respectively, and by in serting after paragraph  (2)  the  following  new paragraph:  ""(3) DEDUCTION ALLOWED FOR LOCAL SEWER  AND WATER FEES.""(A) IN GENERAL.-Local sewer and water  fees shall be allowed as a deduction under  subsection Ca)  in the same manner as local  real property taxes.

1160,737,16,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, I intro duce  legislation to authorize Federal  assistance  to establish  the historical  Lovejoy Elementary School Building  in Washington, DC,  as an African American Higher Education Center. I  am pleaseld to do so as a tribute to the  remarkable  career of Elijah Parish  Lovejoy.  Elijah Parish Lovejoy was a fiery ab olitionist, a newsman, and an educator.  Born in 1802, his varied career includ ed  the  founding  of  an  innovative  school  in St. Louis, MO for African American children. He suffered many  hardships  for  defending  his  views  against slavery and his belief in the  education  of  all  children. He was  forced to flee St. Louis and settle in  Alton,  IL because he stood up and  spoke out for what he believed. In Illi nois,  using  his  press  and  editorial  skills, he battled for the rights of all  Americans. Tragically in 1837, at the  young age of 35, Elijah Lovejoy gave  his  life defending  the  right  to  free  speech and civil rights.  In addition  to being named after  Elijah Lovejoy, the Lovejoy Building,  located at the corner of 12th and D  Streets, NE.,  in Washington, DC, has  an exciting and rich history. Not only  was it used as Army barracks during  the Civil War, but also it was one of  the first schools in the District of Co lumbia for African-American children.  The  school  has  undergone many  changes since it was first erected, but  it's dedication  to  education has  re mained. At present, it is the home of  the National Association for Equal Op portunity  in  Higher  Education  [NAFEOl-nonprofit, voluntary, mem bership organization dedicated to pro moting and enhancing the participa tion of minorities in higher education.  NAFEO  represents  117  historically  and predominantly black colleges and  universities in the United States.  ",1990
1161,789,16,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr.  Presi dent, I wish to acknowledge the pass ing of a Minnesotan who was pos sessed of great dignity,  compassion  and  spirituality. Patrick Butler was  called  the  heart of Hazelden,  the  world-renowned chemical dependency  treatment center in Center City, MN.  He died on July 28, 1990, at the age of  89.  Patrick Butler was born in St. Paul  in 1900. In 1908, he moved to Virginia,  MN, where his family started Butler  Bros., a  successful  iron-mining busi ness. Mr. Butler graduated from Yale  University and joined the family busi ness in 1922. He eventually took the  lead and directed the company until  its sale in 1948.  In 1950, Patrick Butler took a brave  and important step. Embattled by an  addiction  to  alcohol, Mr.  Butler  sought help from what was then called  Hazel's Den,  a  1-year-old  treatment  center located on a small farm in east  central Minnesota. He left the center  in the summer of 1950 with a commit ment to forgo alcohol and to the cen ter's method of treating alcoholics in a  dignified and kind manner.  The Butler family's support helped  the center survive financial difficulties  in the early 1950's. Then, in the mid1960's, Mr. Butler bought what we  now call Hazelden for $50,000. Under  his guidance, the center grew into a  $50 million  nonprofit  organization.  Hazelden produces more self-help lit erature than any other publisher.  Those who knew Mr. Butler said his  goal was not to make Hazelden big and  well known. It was, instead, his goal to  help as many people as he could. He  did that by recognizing the needs of  women and men suffering from chemi cal dependency and  finding ways  to  meet those needs.  For his contribution to the health  and wellness of many people in Minne sota and across the United States and  the world, I posthumously thank Pat rick Butler. And, I extend my condo lences to his wife Aimee, his daughter  Kate Peterson, his sons Peter and Pat rick, Jr., his grandchildren and great grandchild, and his brother Cooley.  Society has benefitted from his life's  work; we are poorer for his passing.e  TRIBUTE TO MARY ABIGAIL  McCARTHY  e ",1990
1162,789,16,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr.  Presi dent, the Senate has lost a member of  its extended family. I wish to acknowl edge  the  death  of Mary Abigail  McCarthy on July 28, 1990, after a  long illness. She was the daughter of  Eugene McCarthy,  the  former U.S.  Senator from Minnesota, and Abigail  Quigley McCarthy.  Mary Abigail McCarthy was a gifted  young woman who, as a college stu dent, actively campaigned among her  peers during Mr. McCarthy's Presiden tial bid  in 1968. She was  a  youth  leader who,  according  to  columnist  Mary McGrory, interpreted the candi date to the young and the young to  the candidate.  Ms. McCarthy was a student at the  Convent of the Visitation School in St.  Paul and Stone Ridge Country Day  School in Washington. She graduated  from Radcliffe College  of Harvard  University and New York University  Law School. In a small Washington based private practice, she carried on  her family's and her own tradition of  service by representing low-income cli ents.  Ms. McCarthy was working  as  a  public def ender in a federally funded  program in Washington when she was  asked  to  teach at Yale University.  During her decade of service, she in troduced courses on the disabled and  on immigration law. Her students also  benefited  from  her  supervision  of  their trial work.  Mary Abigail McCarthy did her gen eration of Minnesotans and Americans  proud. She will be missed.  I extend  condolences to her parents, her sisters  Ellen and Margaret, and her brother  Michael.  WISCONSIN'S CONTRIBUTIONS  TO NASA   ",1990
1163,789,16,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to recognize the contributions of  the great State of Wisconsin  to  the  Nation's space effort. I have recently  had an opportunity to focus on this  subject in conjunction with NASA Ad ministrator Adm. Richard Truly who  was a guest on my cable  television  show, ""Speak Out, Wisconsin.""  Since the future of America's space  program, and the future of America's  competitiveness  in  an  increasingly  technological world, will depend upon  the performance of our young people  in the science, space, and technology  area, I was pleased that 20 young stu dents from Wausau, WI, were able to  participate by asking questions of Ad miral Truly.  Their concerns were much the same  as  those of most Americans  today,  with many questions focusing on the  problems of  the Hubble  space  tele scope, the space station Freedom, the  possibility of  sending astronauts  to  Mars, and  the concerns about math  and science education in this country.  Wisconsin has made numerous con tributions to NASA's programs.  The University of Wisconsin-Madi son developed one of the five  isntru ments on the Hubble space telescope the high speed photometer [HSPJ. It  is used to precisely measure brightness  of celestial bodies in several spectral  bands of ultraviolet [UVl and visible  light,  it  targets pulsars,  supernova,  white dwarfs, binary stars, and rings  ",1990

1165,828,16,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Today we send a  message-American women  do  not  have to die unnecessarily. Passage of  the Breast And Cervical Cancer Mor tality Act of  1990  is  another  step  toward ending the apathy and neglect  that have for too long marked our Na tion's attitude toward women's health  issues. Finally, we have said that we  are willing to bring the resources of  the Federal Government into the fight  against these terrible diseases, which  together claim more than 40,000 lives  a year.  I feel as though we have sent a get  well message to Marilyn Quayle and  the first  lady of Baltimore, Dr. Pat  Schmoke.  I am proud to have sponsored the  Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality  Act, along with 52 of my colleagues.  But I hope this bill will be remem bered not for our efforts, but for the  efforts of Rose Kushner, Jill Ireland  and Nina Hyde-all the women who  have  fought  the good  fight against  breast cancer.  To the end, they held within them selves a special kind of courage, that  carried them beyond their own  life and-death struggles and into the fight  for all woman's lives.  Like many woman, I was touched by  their selfless dedication. Their tireless  efforts  and  special  advocacy  for  women's health live on in the thou sands  of women whose  lives  they  saved. I would like to thank my col leagues for joining me in carrying on  their struggle.  Cervical  cancer  will  strike  over  13,000 women in 1990, most of them  poor. Breast cancer  is  this Nation's  second leading cause of death among  women-one in every ten women will  develop it in their lifetime.  Yet, even though an aggressive, com prehensive program can reduce breast  cancer  deaths  by  30  percent,  the  United States has had no such pro gram. Medicare will  not  pay  for  screenings, and in most States neither  will Medicaid. Women are dying need lessly because they do not have access  to basic medical services.  The Breast  and Cervical Cancer  Mortality Prevention Act begins  to  change that. It is an aggressive pro gram, combining education-both of  women and of health care profession als; payment for services; coordination  with private organizations; and proper  followup  in a single package. And it  delivers  these  services  to  the poor  women, who need_ it most.  The purpose of this bill is to ensure  that States with an inadequate avail ability of services and activities related  to breast and cervical cancer will be  better able to provide these services. It  is my hope that the Centers for Dis ease Control will take into account the  severity  of  the  problems  that  the  grants are meant to address and the  current  availability  of  services  in  awarding grants.  Further, it is my understanding that  the Centers for Disease Control has  always attempted to distribute grants  equitably  among  the principal geo graphic regions of the United States,  and it is my expectation that they will  continue to do so in implementing this  program.  This is a thorough and comprehen sive bill-we have seen what happens  when  the  system  doesn't  follow  through. My  clinical  lab  bill was  signed into law almost 2 years ago, yet  women are still dying from misread  pap smears.  And in New York City, 2,000 poor  women were tested for cervical cancer  by  the Department of Health. They  were never told the results. No news is  not good news for these women, some  of them may be dying.  The Breast  and Cervical Cancer  Mortality Act is a part of the larger  legislative package I introduced earlier  this  week,  The Women's Health  Equity Act of 1990. That package ad dresses  the wide  ranging  inequities  that still permeate our nation's health  care establishment.  Women are systematically excluded  from clinical medical studies around  the country. Women have to be sicker  than men before physicians will per form heart bypass operations-their  complaints are ignored. The U.S. Gov ernment's own National Institutes of  Health completely  ignore obstetrical  and gynecological research. As women  enter the 21st century, they are still  the victims of 14th century attitudes.  I am working to change that. With  this bill we have begun to send a mes sage to the Nation's health care estab lishment: we will not be treated like  second-class citizens.  ",1990

1167,841,16,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, today  the Senate will consider H.R. 94, the  Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of  1989.  As  the  ranking  Republican  member of the Consumer Subcommit tee, I am pleased to endorse this bill  and recommend to my colleagues that  they support it.  The fire safety community is unani mous in recommending sprinkler sys tems as the best way to save lives in  hotel fires. According to testimony re ceived by the Consumer Subcommit tee, however, only one-half of all hotel  rooms now have sprinklers.  H.R. 94 establishes fire safety guide lines for hotels and other public ac commodations  regarding  automatic  sprinkler  systems  and  hard-wired  smoke detectors. The bill directs the  General Services Administration to in clude only those hotels and places of  public accommodation that have satis fied  these safety requirements  in  its  official directory of lodging places for  Federal employees. Travel by Federal  employees  to  facilities  that do not  meet these standards will be severely  restricted.  This bill will require the owners of  the stock of existing hotel rooms that  do  not  have  sprinklers  to  decide  whether to retrofit these facilities in  order to comply with the safety guide lines. No hotel will be able to compete  for a  share of  the Federal Govern ment's business  unless  it  complies.  This is a powerful economic incentive  as the Federal Government spends ap proximately $1.6 billion annually for  lodging  for  its employees. However,  the best reason for enacting this legis lation is that it promotes safety. And,  by making travel safer for Federal em ployees, this bill will make travel safer  for all Americans.  Mr. President, this measure was not  without controversy. Some expressed  concern that the sprinkler retrofitting  requirement went too far, and it would  be a signal to state and local officials  and model code organizations that this  was a panacea to the exclusion of all  other fire safety measures. In response  to these concerns, the committee ex tended the exemption to the sprinkler  requirement in the House-passed bill  from two to three stories. And, the bill  as reported by the committee contains  a provision which states clearly that,  while supporters of  the bill endorse  the safety guidelines, they are not to  be construed as a replacement for fire retardant building materials that are  required  in building codes or by  a  hotel's corporate policy.  Mr. President,  I wish  to commend  Senator BRYAN,  the chairman of the  Consumer Subcommittee for his work  in bringing this important issue to the  Commerce Committee and the Senate.  I share his interest in promoting the  safety and well-being of the American  people, and I  join him in urging our  colleagues to support H.R. 94.  ",1990

Since we marked up the authoriza tion bill,  the committee has deter mined that funds requested for fiscal  year 1991 are excess to the needs of  several programs.  Also the committee has determined  that several meritorious programs are  not accurate  funding  in  the Presi dent's budget for fiscal year 1991, and  in the case of another program, the  NBC reconnaissance system, NBCRS,  which committee  terminated due  to  the apparent lack of service support,  the Army since persuaded the commit tee of its commitment to this program.

ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION OF APPRO  PRIATIONS.  <a>  .ARMY.-<1> In addition to the amount  authorized  to be appropriated by section  101<5>. there is hereby authorized to be ap  propriated for fiscal year 1991 for the Army  for procurement of the Nuclear Biological,  Chemical  Reconnaissance  System  $36,914,000.  <2> Notwithstanding  section 201<1), not  more than $5,691,000 is authorized to be ap propriated for the Army for fiscal year 1991  for research, development, test, and evalua tion.

",1990
1182,880,16,Mr. NUNN.," Mr. President, since we  marked up the authorization bill, the  committee has detemined that funds  requested  for  fiscal  year  1991  are  excess  to  the needs of several pro grams. Also, the committee has deter mined  that several meritorious pro grams are not adequately funded  in  the President's request for fiscal year  1991. In the case of another program,  the  NBC  reconnaissance  system  [NBCRSJ, which the committee termi nated due to an apparent lack of serv ice support, the Army has since per suaded the committee of its commit ment  to  this program. The amend ment we propose would rectify these  funding Imbalances.  The Army has recently restructured  its Antisatellite Weapon Program. As a  result, $6 million  in fiscal year 1990  and $49.4 million of the funds request ed for fiscal year 1991 are excess to  program needs. In addition, the fiscal  year 1991 request for advance procure ment for long-lead items for the De fense Meteorological  Satellite  Pro gram [DMSPJ is larger than required.  Also a reduction of $5 million to the  TR-1  Reconnaissance Aircraft  Re search and Development Program, de scribed 1n the classified annex to the  report, was  inadvertently left out of  the tables in the report.  The amendment we proposed would  reduce  the  amount  authorized  for  fiscal year 1991 for Army research, de velopment,  test,  and  evaluation  [RDT&El  for  the Asat Program by  $55.4 million;  for Air Force RDT&E  for the TR-1 by $5 million; and Air  Force missile  procurement  for  the  DMSP by $20.7 million, for a total re duction of $8.1 million. These reduc tions would be offset by authorizing  additional funds for four programs to taling $8.1 million.  The  first of  these programs  is  a  modification aboard  the ES-3A  air craft which will allow automatic pas sive  electronic  reconnaissance:  the  battle group passive horizon extension  system [BGPHESJ.  The  Armed  Services  Committee  denied the fiscal year 1991 funding re quest for both procurement of the air borne payloads and research and dev lopment of the associated surface ter minals due to the fact that full fund ing of the teminals was not presented  in the current 6-year defense plan.  Subsequently, the Navy has indicat ed  that  restoration of  the procure ment funding will allow completion of  the operational evaluation and ready  the system for fleet  implementation  during fiscal year 1992, an action re quired independently from surface ter minal installation.  By providing  the $5.2 million  re quested for this purpose, this amend ment will ensure that operational in troduction occurs on the original Navy  schedule.    The amendment also authorizes an  additional  $9 million  for  the Air  Force's Spacetrack Program  to  en hance  the Nation's  capabilities  to  detect, identify, and characterize satel lites, other space objects, and space  debris. These funds, together with $6  million already recommended in this  bill for this purpose above the request ed level, begin an upgrade of the tele scope and  facilities of  the Service's  Maui Optical Station, know as AMOS.  This upgrade project has been desig nated  the Advanced Electro-Optical  System by the Air Force.  The contract savings in the antisat ellite program give the Senate the op portunity  to more  adequately  fund  this needed project.  The AMOS upgrade can contribute  to meeting the Air Force's research,  development, and operational require ments in the space surveillance area.  It also will address the needs of the  National Aeronautics and Space Ad ministration and other Federal agen cies. AMOS has a long history of ful filling these requirements, and this en hancement will strengthen its capabili ties for the next decade and the 21st  century.  The amendment also would restore  funding  for  procurement  of  the  Army's NBC Reconnaissance System  [NBCRSJ, which the Armed Services  Committee denied  due  to  concerns  that the Army ha.d not planned to pro cure enough vehicles to justify adding  another  logistical burden. Since  the  committee marked up the authoriza tion  bill,  however,  Mr.  Stephen  Conver, the Assistant Secretary of the  Army for Research, Development, and  Acquisition, has written the committee  explaining the Army's position on the  importance of this vehicle and its ra tionale for planned procurement quan tities. Mr. Conver also stated: ""NBCRS  ranks high on our list of those items  of modern equipment we would pro cure should additional funds become  available in the future."" The commit tee recommends restoring funding for  this program.  Finally,  the amendment would au thorize $30 million for single-pulse ex cimer  laser  technology development  and experimentation. The committee  believes this technology represents an  important alternative  to other  laser  technologies now being pursued. The  committee directs that DARPA admin ister these funds for the following pur poses on a  competitive basis: First,  DARPA should provide funds, in coop eration with the Air Force, the Army.  and the national laboratories to dem onstrate the capability to construct a  low-cost,  single-pulse  laser device at  ",1990
1183,906,16,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased  to  introduce  the Renewable Energy  Technology Transfer Act of 1990 which will  enhance the movement of technology devel oped by Federal research programs to State  and  local governments and  the U.S.  renew able and energy efficiency industries.  . During the 8 years of the previous adminis tration, solar and renewable energy R&D suf fered severe cuts and was relegated to long term, high-risk research. During that time, our  international competitors, sensing a lack of re solve by  the United States to commercialize  our technology, began pumping resources into  Government R&D programs for short-term ap plied research. As a result,  they have all  in creased  their world market share  in  technol ogies  in which  the United States still barely  holds the technical lead.  The  first section of  the bill provides  in creased authorization for the U.S. Department  of Energy's State and Local Government As sistance Programs, from $5 to $6.6 million be tween  fiscal year 1991-93, to allow U.S. in dustry and State governments to joint venture  emerging technology projects. Government/in dustry joint ventures have proven themselves  as an effective tool to accelerate the accept ance of new technologies in the marketplace.  This  legislation will encourage  the U.S. De partment of Energy, State governments, and  the U.S.  renewable energy and energy effi ciency market development effort. This sec tion also provides additional funds to existing  State research entities that have proven them selves as ""Centers of Excellence""  for solar,  renewable energy, and technology transfer.  The second section encourages further in novation in the existing Department of EnergyEXTENSIONS OF .REMARKS  supported Federal  laboratories  in providing  more aggressive outreach for and with indus try, local governments, and the general public.  A modest increase of $5  to $6.6 million be tween fiscal year 1991-93 will begin to estab lish  a  sorely  needed  information  network  geared to the applied research and actual use  of  these energy saving  technologies. While  the solar and  renewable  technologies have  become mature and cost effective, few know  about these advances in the technologies. In  addition, this section provides minor funding to  identify existing successful technology transfer  models as a way to more broadly replicate the  best mechanisms that have pushed these in novations in the marketplace.  The final section provides resources to U.S.  industry to access market development infor mation and provide overseas market outreach  for the U.S. renewable energy and energy effi ciency industry. Our competitors overseas cur rently access U.S.  information  to help build  their  technical expertise and market share.  Our industry has been unable to access our  own government information as quickly. These  provisions allow  the development of a com puter  information network  for  industry and  State and  local governments. The provisions  also call  for establishing overseas outreach  offices for the U.S. industry in the key market  development areas of  the Pacific Rim and  Caribbean Basin and Latin America which will  provide a long-term industry presence to build  market share.  This bill I am introducing requires less than  $20 million per year over 3 years. This amount  of money will  leverage according  to  industry  experts over $100 million in sales of U.S. re newable energy equipment. Expansion of re newable energy sales represents one govern ment policy  that not only promotes environ mentally sound applications but results in  in creased American jobs and a decreased trade  deficit due to its supplanting of oil imports.  The administration's request  for  increased  solar and renewable energy R&D funding for  fiscal year 1991  is a welcome sign. But re search and development alone will not build  markets for these technologies. More effective  and aggressive technology transfer programs  are the  important  linkage  to effectively com mercialize  emerging  technologies.  This  modest  legislation provides a good start  in  that direction.  With increasing tensions in the Middle East  between  Iraq and Kuwait,  the United States  would be well advised in building our domestic  alternative energy sources. Solar and renew able energy now comprise over 1 O percent of  U.S. energy and with greater market develop ment incentives, could supply over 20 percent  by the year 2000. Let's get on with it.  HONORING THE 25TH ANNIVER SARY OF THE  SHUTESBURY,  MA, ATHLETIC CLUB  HON. SILVIO 0. CONTE  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 1990  ",1990
1184,906,16,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  extend my  sincere  congratulations  to  the  August 3, 1990  Shutesbury Athletic Club  located  in Shutes bury, MA, on the occasion of its 25th anniver sary. The club  is celebrating  this occasion  with a dinner dance on August 25, 1990, and  this affair promises to be a smashing event.  From the days of the clubs first president,  Mike Plaza and friends, playing ball behind a  fire shed in 1957, to the day of the club's in corporation  in 1965,  the Shutesbury Athletic  Club has more than served its purpose of pro moting athletics such as softball, baseball,  basketball, bowling and pool in the communi ty. The many  trophies adorning  the building  can attest to that fact.  The Shutesbury Athletic Club not only pro motes athletics, but also encourages commu nity  involvement  in group projects and  the  need  to  share  trials and  triumphs among  family and  friends.  Indeed, many of the cur rent active members regard the club as their  home away from home.  Truly the club has produced some marvel ous athletic  teams such as Robert Carey's  1989 softball squad, which traveled to Detroit  to compete  in  the United States Slo-Pitch  Softball Association Championship and  the  women's softball team which won the USSSA  Massachusetts State Championship in 1985.  Many of  the club's members have been  around since its formation in 1957 and some  of the men's softball team members have fa thers who played on  the same  team before  them. However, all of  the members have  strived to make the Shutesbury Athletic Club  the  prosperous,  family-oriented  place  it  is  today.  Mr. Speaker,  the  town of Shutesbury and  the Shutesbury Athletic Club clearly demon strates  that some of  life's simple pleasures  such as sports, camaraderie, and an apprecia tion of friendly competition are alive and well,  especially,  in  this great little town  in western  Massachusetts.  Again,  I give  the Shutesbury Athletic Club  my heartfelt congratulations on its 25 years of  accomplishments, my warmest  regards, and  my best wishes for the club's continued exist ence for future generations.

1186,932,16,Mr. DYMALL Y.," Mr. Speaker,  last January,  the Special Representative of the United Na tions, Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, traveled to Iran  to make a first  time 8-day  investigation  into  the human rights situation. His report, howev er, resulted in concealing and occasionally re versing the truth of the atrocites committed by  the Khomeini regime, and thus, served the in terests of  the dictatorship  ruling  Iran. As a  result of such encouragement, the leaders of  the  Iranian  regime  found  their hands  freer  than before,  to violate human  rights  in  that  country and wage an unbridled campaign of  terrorism abroad.  Immediate  consequences  of  the  report  were: A surge  in  the number of executions  and  arrests,  stepped  up  harassment  of  women  and  assassination  of dissidents  in  exile.  Iranian state-run newspapers Jomhouri  lslami on February 17, 1990, and Kayhan on  February 18, 1990, reported the execution of  three persons in Hamedan:  EXTENSIONS OF .REMARKS  1. Mohammad-Hossein Golzar Kabir, age:  27, sentenced to 173  lashes and beheading  by a sword.  2. Gholam-Hossein Golzar Kabir, age: 28,  sentenced to 148 lashes, being stabbed three  times with a knife in the upper half of his  body, and beheading by a sword.  3. Reza Khanian, age: 23, sentenced to 148  lashes, being stabbled three  times with a  knife in the upper half of his body, and be heading by a sword.  The verdicts carried out, in the matter of  a few hours after being issued, at 8:30 a.m.  on Thursday in the presence of a number of  national officials, near the site of the crime      . The cut-off heads of two of the al leged criminals      were placed on the top  of Bou Ali Sina's tomb <a sightseeing and  tourist attraction>. The corpses were driven  around the city on a crane.  In  reporting on his 8-day visit  to  Iran, Mr.  Galindo Pohl contends that the Iranian regime  has abandoned the practice of public execu tions. Tehran  leaders, however, reported 206  public executions, carried out in  less than 5  months, published  in  the state-run newspa pers.  On  the  issue of terrorism abroad, on April  24,  in Geneva, the Khomeini regime's agents  assassinated Dr. Kazem Rajavi,  the  leading  defender of human rights in Iran, and brother  of Mr. Massoud Rajavi,  leader of the  Iranian  Resistance, as he was driving home. The Mo jahedin's Resistance movement  immediately  announced  the names of  the operatives  in volved, which  included Tehran's Ambassador  and charge d'affaires in Switzerland.  On June 22, a Swiss  judge  identified  the  murderers: Thirteen agents ""from more than  one service of the Tehran regime"" who had  come  to Europe using government service  passports.  In  fact, Galindo Pohl's  report never  re mained committed  to  its crucial  international  mandate of investigating one of the most hor. rifying  records  of atrocity  in  contemporary  times. The report as a whole, is a collection of  counterfeit evidence, distorted facts and rep etitions of statements by criminals  like Laje vardi, infamous as the Butcher of Evin Prison.  Under the banner of human rights,  the basis  and objectives of the report had been prede termined  to  justify the crimes of  the regime  ruling Iran.  The  Iranian Resistance has  recently criti cized Mr. Galindo Pohl's 76-page report in a  354-page documentary book entitled, ""Human  Rights Betrayed; Galindo Pohl's Report Under  Scrutiny."" Excerpts of that book are enlighten ing as to what has taken place in the name of  the United Nations.  Of  the  total number of paragraphs  in  the  report, 28 percent are devoted to violations of  human rights, 61 percent to the regime's wit nesses and officials, and 11 percent to gener al statements and definitions which  refer  to  the objectivity of the mission. Disregarding the  11 percent of general statements, we find that  69 percent of  the  report  is  in  favor of  the  Tehran regime.  Citing statements by the Special Prosecutor  for Drug Trafficking, paragraph 244 of Mr. Ga lindo Pohl's  report states  that  ""there have  been-no  executions-in  public  for  5  months.""  A simple reference to the  information pro vided by the  Iranian Resistance, would have  August 3, 1990  revealed that only on the basis of the Iranian  regime's official announcements in the state run newspapers, public and mass executions  had been carried out on October 8, 12, 17,  24, 30, and 31, November 11, 18, and 27, and  on December 6 and 9. In response to this dis tortion of the truth, Mr. Galindo Pohl conced ed in his Geneva press conference that there  could be some inaccuracies.  Prior to the report, Mr. Galindo Pohl was re peatedly cautioned  that  the Tehran  regime  would clean up Evin Prison, leaving only a se lected number of prisoners in order to prepare  it for exhibition for reporters. He had also re ceived addresses and  floor plans of other  secret and nonsecret prisons  in Tehran, as  well as  information on  the  location of mass  graves  in  the vicinity of the capital. Yet, he  sufficed  to only visit  the workshop of Evin  Prison.  In reality, the Khomeini regime brought sev eral individuals before Galindo Pohl who gave  testimony that, albeit their names were includ ed as victims of execution, they were, indeed,  alive. Therefore,  it  is obvious  that  the Kho meini  regime attempted  to undermine  facts  and findings provided Mr. Galindo Pohl, by the  Iranian Resistance regarding the execution of  more  than 16,000  individuals. Unfortunately,  the Special Representative  succumbed  to  these tactics, resulting  in no reference what soever, to the findings by the Iranian Resist ance and  furthermore, did not even attempt,  to  investigate  the  remaining 16,000 names  and particulars.  Interestingly enough,  if he had examined  the list, he would have found that two of the  four names provided by the regime, Mr. Moh moud Reza Said Nejad  and Mr. Behman  Garai, never even appeared in the list of exe cution victims published by the Iranian Resist ance. Furthermore, the names of two other in dividuals, Mr. Ismail Zarei and Mr. Soghra Far hadi, had been officially announced as being  executed by the regime itself.  Again  the Special Representative  is given  false information, yet he confidently cites it as  a true statement without  further attempts  to  verify it. He does the same with regards to the  statements  of  Lajevardi,  infamous  as  the  Butcher  of Evin,  and mullah Moghtada'i,  whose verdict on  the  forms of executions beheading by sword, stoning to death, casting  from a height, demolishing a wall on the con vict' s head, and burning alive-once shocked  the world. Statements made by  such high  level officials are included in the conclusion of  the  report as  the Special Representative's  new discoveries in Iran.  Additionally, as cited in paragraph 237, ad ditional witnesses were not able  to see  the  Special Representative, because  the  regime  had ""literally blocked the way for anyone who  wanted to enter.""  Based on article 11 of the 46th session of  the Human Rights Commission's  resolution,  Geneva-March 1990, periodic inspections by  the International Red Cross were to be made  of all prisons in Iran. Based on this same res olution, Galindo Pohl has been given a man date to again visit Iran. It is unclear, however,  why no Red Cross  inspections have  taken  place while  the Special Representative was  preparing for his. second visit.  ",1990
1187,945,16,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am introducing the Small Business Tax Incen tive Act of 1990.  This bill contains several tax incentives for  small businesses, as well as provisions  to  make the Internal Revenue Service more re sponsive  to small business concerns  in  its  promulgation of tax regulations. This bill is in tended  to address  legitimate needs of small  businesses, but within the confines of current  budgetary constraints.  I would  like  to com mend our  colleague,  the Honorable NORM  S1s1sKY, who, as always has been instrumen tal  in advancing  the  interests of small busi nesses.   The bill which I am introducing today incor porates a proposal similar  to one originally  sponsored by the Honorable FRED UPTON and  the Honorable KWEISI MFUME in H.R. 3500 to  provide a new tax credit of up to $5,000 for  expenditures incurred by small businesses for  public  accommodations access.  I want  to  commend both of my colleagues for their bi partisan cooperation across  the aisle  to get  this done. This provision  is  intended  to pro vide  relief  for small businesses  that will be  faced with new obligatio.ns to make such ex penditures under the recently enacted Ameri cans With Disabilities Act. To offset revenue  losses from this provision, the existing cap on  deductions  for  removing  architectural  and  transportation barriers would be reduced from  $35,000 to $15,000.  The bill would also extend permanently the  25-percent deduction  for  health  insurance  costs of self-employed individuals. The current  provision is scheduled to expire after Septem ber 30, 1990.  In addition, the bill would require the Small  Business Administration  to comment  to  the  IRS on the impact of proposed regulations on  small businesses, and  the  IRS would be re quired  to consider these comments and dis cuss  them when  it publishes its final regula tions.  Finally, the bill contains a provision intended  to be of benefit to all taxpayers and to make  the Federal Government more accountable by  requiring  income  tax  instruction booklets  to  contain displays showing the sources and dis position of Federal  revenues. This proposal  was originally put  forward by our colleague,  the Honorable HOWARD WOLPE,  in H.R. 4555,  and  I commend him  for this useful contribu tion.  While my purpose in  introducing this bill  is  to provide  relief  for small businesses,  I am  also committed  that all  legislative  initiatives  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  must be revenue neutral in this time of severe  budgetary constraints. Mr. Speaker, in keeping  with my strongly held view on fiscal responsi bility,  it is my intention that if this small busi ness bill moves forward in the legislative proc ess, it would be fully financed in the course of  the normal budget reconciliation process.  Mr. Speaker, an explanation of the bill ac companies this statement.  EXPLANATION OF THE SMALL BUSINESS TAX  INCENTIVE ACT OF 1990 (H.R. 5455)  1. Treatment of certain expenditures in curred to make public accommodations ac cessible to disabled individuals <secs. 201 and  202 of the bill and sec. 190 and new sec. 43  of the Code).  PRESENT LAW  Under present law, a taxpayer may elect  to deduct certain architectural and trans portation barrier removal expenses for the  taxable year  in which paid or  incurred  rather than capitalizing such expenses: Ar chitectural and  transportation barrier  re moval expenses are defined for this purpose  as expenditures that are paid or incurred by  a  taxpayer  in order  to make facilities or  public  transportation  vehicles  owned  or  leased  in connection with  the  taxpayer's  business more  accessible  to  handicapped  and elderly individuals. In order for such ex penditures to be deductible under this provi sion, the taxpayer must establish to the sat isfaction of the Treasury Secretary that the  facility or public transportation vehicle to  which the expenditures relate conforms to  standards promulgated by the Treasury Sec retary with the concurrence of the Architec tural and Transportation Barriers Compli ance Board. The amount of the deduction  allowed under this provision for any taxable  year is limited to $35,000.  EXPLANATION OF PROVISION  Public accommodations access credit  In general  Under the bill, an eligible small business is  allowed an income tax credit of up to $5,000  for the amount of eligible public accommo dations access expenditures paid or incurred  during a taxable year. The credit is a gener al business credit and, consequently,  the  credit is subject to the rules of present law  that limit the amount of the general busi ness credit that may be used for any taxable  year.  Definition of eligible small business  An eligible small business is defined for  any taxable year as any person that is en gaged in the trade or business of operating a  public accommodation and that is required  by Federal law to make such accommoda tion accessible to, or usable by, individuals  with a disability if < 1) the gross receipts 1 of  the person for the preceding taxable year  did not exceed $1 million, (2) the person had  fewer than 15 full-time employees 2 during  the preceding  taxable year, and  (3)  the  person elects the application of the provi sion by claiming the credit for the taxable  year.  Definition of eligible public  accommodations access expenditures  Eligible public accommodations access ex penditures are defined as amounts paid or  1 The gross receipts of a person for any taxable  year are to be determined after reduction for re turns and allowances made during the taxable year.  For  this purpose, a full-time employee is defined  as any employee of the taxpayer who is employed  at least 30 hours per week for 20 or more calendar  weeks during the taxable year.  23073  incurred by a  taxpayer either < 1)  for the  purpose of removing architectural, commu nication, or transportation barriers which  prevent a public accommodation operated  by the taxpayer from being accessible to, or  usable by,  individuals with a disability, or  (2) for providing auxiliary aids and services  to individuals with a disability who are em ployees of, or using, a public accommoda tion operated by the taxpayer.  The amount of an expenditure is not to be  considered an eligible public accommoda tions access expenditure unless the taxpay er establishes  to  the satisfaction of  the  Treasury Secretary that the removal of any  barrier or the provision of any auxiliary aids  and services to which the expenditure re lates satisfies standards set forth in regula tions promulgated by the Treasury Secre tary with the concurrence of the Architec tural and Transportation Barriers Compli ance Board. In addition, amounts paid or in curred by a taxpayer for the purpose of re moving  architectural,  communication,  or  transportation barriers do not qualify as eli gible public accommodations access expendi tures if the amounts are paid or incurred in  connection with a facility that is first placed  in service after December 31, 1990.  Other definitions and special rules  For purposes of the credit provision, the  terms ""public accommodation,"" ""disability,""  and ""auxiliary aids and services"" are to have  the respective meanings given such terms by  the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990,  as in effect on the date of enactment of this  provision.  For  purposes  of  applying  the  $5,000  annual  limitation on  the amount of  the  credit and in determining whether the $1  million gross receipts limitation and the 15  full-time employee limitation are satisfied,  all members of the same controlled group of  corporations <as defined  in section 52(a))  and all persons under common control <as  defined in section 52(b)) are treated as one  person. Thus, for example, two or more cor porations  that are members of  the same  controlled group of corporations would be  allowed a credit that is not to exceed $5,000  if, treating all such corporations as a single  person, the $1 million gross receipts limita tion and the 15 full-time employee limita tion are satisfied for the preceding year.  In the case of a partnership, the $5,000  annual  limitation on  the amount of  the  credit is to apply at both the partnership  level and the partner level. Similarly, in the  case of an S corporation, the $5,000 annual  limitation on the amount of the credit is to  apply at both the S corporation level and  the shareholder level.  The bill also provides that to the extent  that a credit is determined with respect to  the amount of any expenditure, then no de duction or credit is to be allowed for such  amount under any other provision of chap ter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code and the  adjusted basis of any property with respect  to which the credit is determined is not to  include such amount.  Finally, the bill requires the Treasury Sec retary to prescribe such regulations as are  necessary to carry out the purposes of the  provision,  including  regulations  that < 1)  adjust the $1 million gross receipts limita tion and the 15 full-time employee limita tion in the case of taxable years that are  less than 12 months and (2) apportion the  $5,000 annual limitation among two or more  members of a controlled group of corpora tions  that are  treated as a  single person  ",1990
1188,958,16,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  pay  tribute  to  the  town of Nuremberg, PA,  which was established 150 years ago. This  month marks the sesquicentennial of the first  settlement and establishment of a genuine  Pennsylvania town called Seiwellsville.  It was  settled primarily by pioneers of German de scent, and  the town was surrounded by for ests.  In  its early days, Seiwellsville was  the  epitome of a young and  vibrant American  community, characterized by freedom of reli gious thought and dreams of prosperity for all  who  chose  to  settle  there.  The  town  of  Seiwellsville was  first renamed New London,  and  its name was  later changed  to Nurem berg.  I take pride in recognizing the 150th anni versary of the town of Nuremberg. It symbol izes the type of northeastern American  town  that was settled primarily as a farm town and  eventually diversified with the establishment of  small businesses. The residents of Nuremberg  embraced the attributes and qualities of true  American life, and they revelled in their liberty  to pursue any goal they wished. Freedom of  religion was witnessed by the establishment of  churches of many different denominations.  Education for all ages was provided through  the careful establishment of schools. And the  business communitY matured along with  the  town when banks, bakeries and blacksmiths  started to set up shop in town.  Today, Nuremberg remains a beautiful and  exciting  town, and  the citizens' civic pride is  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  evidenced by their commitment to preserving  the town in all of its historic splendor. There fore, as the community of Nuremberg comes  together to celebrate their town's sesquicen tennial this month, I ask my colleagues here in  the House of Representatives  to  join me  in  extending my best wishes to them for a happy  celebration and a very prosperous future.  STARK WAS RIGHT AND RIGHT  HON. WILLIAM (BILL) CLAY  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 1990  ",1990
1189,958,16,Mr. CLAY.," Mr.  Speaker,  our  colleague  FORTNEY PETE STARK, of California, was right  in both  instances  involving  the Secretary of  Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan.  Mr. STARK was correct in his public apology  on the floor of this House to Secretary Sulli van  for his  intemperate  remark about  race.  The race of the Secretary is not _the issue and  Mr. STARK sincerely regretted the unfortunate  inference.  Mr. Speaker,  the  issue  is  the quality of  health care for the poor, of whom a dispropor tionate number happen  to be black. On  this  issue Mr. STARK  is  imminently correct in this  criticism. of  the  Secretary  of Health  and  Human Services. It is not some random coin cidence  that  poor  and  black  people  just  happen to lack adequate, quality health care.  These citizens are victimized by  insensitive,  callous Government policies and Secretary  Sullivan is defending these policies.  Mr. Speaker, Secretary Sullivan is a person al  friend of mine, but I still  feel obligated  to  disagree with his professional positions  re garding the health care of impoverished Amer ican citizens. Specifically, his opposition  to  universal health insurance, which is based on  the economic theory that the market place will  resolve  our  health  care  delivery  problem,  poses a great problem for me. Almost 40 mil lion poor Americans-most of them depend ents of persons who work full  time, and dis proportionate number of whom are black and  Hispanic-have no access to adequate health  care service. The plight of  these 40 million  Americans does not bode well  for  the  free  market theory. These  individuals  live  in pain  longer and die earlier  than  those who can  afford  health  treatment.  The  free market  policy that Secretary Sullivan supports is not  reaching these 40 million Americans. How can  we be silent when millions of our brothers and  sisters are suffering this deprivation.  Mr. Speaker, I also disagree with the Secre tary's  public  position  regarding  a national  policy of family and medical leave. His insist ence that such a policy would be counterpro ductive inasmuch as it would make American  companies less competitive with foreign com panies, and force  jobs to move overseas,  is  not supported by the  facts. This same argu ment is repeatedly used by ultra-conservatives  in opposition  to every effort  to  improve  the  benefits of American workers. This argument  is seriously  flawed. Already, more  than 100  countries have national  family  leave policies  that far exceed the benefits stipulated in the  Family and Medical Leave Act which PresiAugust 3, 1990  dent Bush vetoed. Japan and Germany, our  major trade competitors, guarantee at least 3  months of paid family leave. U.S. businesses  would not be disadvantaged by a family leave  law. Mr. Speaker, I would think that the Secre tary of the Department of Health and Human  Services should be sensitive  to  the stress  problems created when a worker must choose  between a job and  taking  family  leave to be  present with  a newborn  child  or a dying  parent.  Mr. Speaker,  I was appalled  that six or  seven Members on the other side of the aisle  took to this well and attacked Mr. STARK  in  such a questionable manner. Each of  them.  expressed  indignation about a  racial  state ment and each proceeded to vote against the  Civil Rights Restoration Act which we passed  today. Apparently, some Members are more  indignant about a racial but not racist remark,  than they are about protecting the basic civil  and human  rights of Secretary Sullivan and  his fellow black citizens.  Mr. Speaker,  I hope  that Dr. Sullivan will  expand his one dimensional program regard ing medical care for minorities. I am afraid that  the perception so  far  is  that  if blacks and  other minorities just stopped smoking, all their  health problems would blow away.  DARE PROGRAM-PROVEN  EFFECTIVE  HON. ROBERT H.

1190,958,16,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, The Drug Abuse  Resistance Education [DARE] Program, estab lished in 1987, has taught children the mecha nisms necessary  to  say no  to drugs. The  DARE Program, now taught in 49 States and  overseas, has a strong  record of success.  This year this program will reach an estimated  4.5 million students. The positive aspects of  this program are  illustrated  in a  letter  I re ceived from Bob Carlson, an eighth-grader in  my district, which I would like to share with my  colleagues:  ""I am an eighth grader at Blessed Sacra ment School  in Morton, Illinois, which  is  just southwest of Peoria. In Sixth grade I  had participated in the D.A.R.E. program  and will be participating  in  it again  this  year.  I feel this is an extraordinary program. It  teaches kids the consequences of drugs and  also helps kids build their self-esteem. One  of the best things it does, is that it tells kins  how to say NO.  I think this is one of the best drug educa tion programs around.  I  feel  this would  heavily decrease the drug problems over the  years. I think D.A.R.E. should be a nation wide drug program.""

1191,971,16,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, a short time  ago, northeastern Minnesota lost a fine  jour nalist and a good friend.  For 40 years, William H. ""Bill"" Krueger was  a voice of conscience  for  listeners  to  radio  station KDAL  in Duluth. Two generations of  news  consumers grew up  listening  to Bill  Krueger's news and commentary each day.  Bill brought Duluth radio into a new era. He  was  the  first  full-time  radio  journalist  in  the  market. He was also the area's first broadcast  editorialist, and his commentaries were always  well-reasoned,  insightful and  thought-provok ing. He was not afraid  to  take an unpopular  position, or to stand up for what he believed.  Bill's big, authoritative voice belied his small  physical stature. Afflicted by a genetic disor der that stunted his growth, Bill stood 4-foot-6.  Additionally, a spinal defect, possibly related  to his size,  left him confined to a wheelchair  for the past 36 years.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Bill saw his physical problems as a chal lenge,  rather  than a handicap. Besides his  radio work, he also wrote a column  for a  weekly newspaper, the Duluth Budgeteer, and  taught journalism at the University of Minneso ta at Duluth.  However,  it was  in  radio where Bill made  the greatest impact.  In  that magical medium,  where presence  is more  important  than ap pearance, he stood 1 O feet  tall. His  list of  awards and citations  is  lengthy and  impres sive. He was recognized throughout Minneso ta and the Midwest as a leader in journalism,  as a friend of education and as an advocate  of the handicapped.  Bill  retired 5 years ago, but continued  to  provide commentary for KDAL and KOHL-TV.  His death May 25 marked the end of an era  for broadcasting  in  the Twin Ports, and  in  northeastern  Minnesota  and  northwestern  Wisconsin.  I invite my colleagues to join me  in recog nizing the accomplishments of this remarkable  man, and in extending sympathy to his widow,  Marilyn,  and  his  children: Margaret, Mary,  Kathleen, Paul, Phillip, and Daniel.  In closing,  I would  like  to share with  the  House three of Bill's commentaries, broadcast  on KDAL just before his retirement  in 1985.  I'm sure after reading them, you will share my  unending admiration  for Bill Krueger, a be loved and treasured friend.  THIS Is BILL KRUEGER WITH COMMENT  There  is always  the future  tense about  international  terrorism-where and when  will  it happen next. America had been  hungry for some kind of victory over terror ism, and it got one when American fighter  planes forced the Egyptian airliner to land  in a Sicily rather than proceeding to Tunis.  For its expert effort, the United States cap tured four suspected terrorists. And Presi dent Reagan made  a  public  statement,  saying  about  the Navy  pilots  involved:  ""These young Americans sent a message to  terrorists  everywhere;  they can  run but  they can't hide.""  While the United States did achieve a vic tory, the President, as is his wont, carried  the value and  the significance somewhat  beyond the reality. Terrorists will continue  to run and hide, and they will continue to  strike. Moreover,  it is  impossible  to know  what this capture of terrorists will do so far  as other American hostages overseas are  concerned and what stimulus  the forcing  down of the airliner will have on other ter rorist attacks at points unknown around the  world.  It is to be hoped that if, by some chance,  the terrorists are extradited to the United  States that we, through the Reagan admin istration and the media, will not put on a  show trial of some kind. That would be to  lose  completely  the perspective  on  this  recent achievement, where a battle  truly  has been won, but where the war continues  at about the same pitch as in the past.  Most of the research studies on Lake Su perior continue to tell us that it is becoming  increasingly polluted, despite  the best ef forts to keep it clean. At least one member  of the Minnesota pollution control agency  has said that we must accept a certain level  of pollution if we are to maintain industrial  development  in the region. No one states  clearly how much pollution that might be,  and once a breach is made in that wall of  cleanliness, how much pollution does one  allow.  23099  Lake Superior and the other Great Lakes  were the result of a great glacial movement  thousands or millions of years ago. There  are nothing but so-called natural pollution  of the lakes for years following that time only the fallen trees and the natural erosion  to muddy the water. But since the industrial  revolution, there has been a slowly growing  level of pollution, which expands more rap idly year by year because there are more  people and because there is heightened eco nomic development.  Lay people can assume that Lake Superior  will be around in a recognizable shape and  form until the next great glacier, if there is  one. In the meantime, we will be passing the  lake along to countless generations in the  future. By allowing what we called limited  pollution, we will be turning an increasingly  dirty lake over to generations to come. Since  it takes scores of years for this giant body of  water to flush itself, what kind of increasing  degradation can our great-great-grandchil dren and those who follow expect from this  father of waters?  A  former Twin Ports  television  news  achorwoman, Cindy Brucato, is the subject  of an interesting yet unsettling profile  in  the Minneapolis paper last week. Cindy was  rather a brash, assertive person who con veyed that very personality as an achorwo man at channel 10 in Duluth in the mid-sev enties then she moved on to channel 5 in  the Twin Cities, into the big leagues as the  twin cities market is often called. Cindy ulti mately worked into an anchor spot at 5, 6,  and 10 p.m., conveying the same assertive ness with considerable success.  Now, according to the newspaper profile  by TV critic Nick Coleman, Cindy Brucato  has changed, and Cindy acknowledges the  change. After being taken off two of her  broadcasts while the station was suffering  some  low audience ratings, Cindy became  softer and more demure, somewhat more re tiring in her interaction with the male co anchor. It seems she had received  letters  from viewers suggesting she tone down her  image, and powers and the TV station sug gested much the same. So Cindy Brucato  changed.  The point of all this is that here, again,  the medium becomes  the message. Cindy  Brucato presumably is a newswoman and it  should not matter whether she is assertive  to a point on the TV tube. What should  matter is her news sense and her ability to  get the news across to the viewers-neither  of which has been questioned. But the reali ty is that these latter elements are less and  less concern. Cindy Brucato becomes yet an other victim of image over substance in the  electronic news business.  TRIBUTE TO JULIE ARMOR  HON. RONALD K. MACHTLEY  OF RHODE ISLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 1990  ",1990
1192,971,16,Mr. MACHTLEY.," Mr. Speaker, it is my dis tinct pleasure to congratulate Julie Armor, of  Portsmouth, RI,  this year's ""Providence Jour nal Bulletin Honor Roll Girl.""  Julie, who attends Portsmouth High School,  is an outstanding athlete. She excels at a  wide variety of athletics, including basketball,  gymnastics, cross country, and track. Through  her 4 years of high school she was chosen for  ""All-State and All-Division"" teams in track.  In  ",1990
1193,984,16,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  take this opportunity to draw the attention of  my colleagues  to a bill  I have  introduced  today, H.R. 5458,  the National Guard Alien  Enlistment Act.  This measure is the result of a careful eval uation and  revision of H.R. 3971,  legislation  granting  lawful  residence  status  to  certain  aliens enlisting in the U.S. Armed Forces.  H.R. 3971  is intended to alleviate the critical  manpower shortage currently  facing several  National Guard and Reserve units throughout  our Nation. On September 21, 1989, an earlier  version of  this measure was  the subject of  hearings before the House Judiciary Subcom mittee on Immigration, Refugees, and Interna tional Law.  In response to comments from the Depart ment of Defense,  the Department of State,  and  the  Immigration and Naturalization Serv ice, I revised the original legislation to narrow  its focus and making it more responsive to the  bill's original intent.  H.R. 3971 was the result of those revisions.  However, once again the legislation has been  revised based upon  the suggestions of  the  Defense Department.  This new measure is virtually identical to the  previous measure with three important excep tions:   First, the alien enlistment program would be  authorized for a limited period of 3 years, and  the Secretary of Defense will  report  to  the  Congress on  the success of  the program at  the close of the 3-year program.  Second, a limit of six States with a person nel strength of less than 95 percent,  instead  of 90 percent, of  the authorized strength of  that State's National Guard as of September  30, 1990, would be eligible.  Finally,  the  new  legislation would  allow  1,000 aliens, rather than 3,000, to enlist in the  National Guard each year  in  those eligible  States.  Mr. Speaker,  I am  requesting  that  the  full  text of H.R. 5458 be inserted at this point in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, and  I invite my  colleagues to cosponsor this measure.  H.R. 5458  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT ENLISTMENTS  IN THE NATIONAL GUARD FROM CER TAIN ALIENS.  Section 302 of title 32, United States Code,  is amended by adding at the end the follow ing new subsection:  ""(d)(l)(A) Under  regulations  to be pre scribed by the Secretary concerned, an origi nal enlistment in the Army National Guard  or Air National Guard of a designated State  may be accepted during the three-year test  period <as defined in paragraph (8)) from a  person who is not a citizen of the United  States and who  is otherwise described  in  paragraph (2) if the actual total personnel  strength of the Army National Guard and  Air National Guard  of  that  designated  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  State, at the time of such enlistment, is less  than the baseline strength for that desig nated State.

""(C) For purposes of this subsection, the  term 'baseline strength', with respect to a  designated State, means 95 percent of the  total authorized strength of the Army Na tional Guard and Air National Guard of  that designated State as prescribed by Fed eral  law or regulation  for September 30,  1990.

At the end of such three-year  test period, the Secretary of Defense shall  submit a report to Congress on the oper ation of this subsection.

1197,1023,16,Mr. WALLOP., I yield 11 minutes to  the Senator from Pennsylvania.  ,1990
1198,1023,16,Mr.  SPECTER.," Mr.  President,  I  commend my distinguished colleagues,  Senator  BINGAMAN  and  Senator  SHELBY,  for  their work in this area,  and it is with reluctance that I dis agree with the import of their amend ment because  in my  judgment we  should be allocating more resources to  SDI for the flexibility with our efforts  along that line.  It is my judgment, the potential for  SDI for effective defense is enormous.  There have been times when our lead ing scientists said we could not have  intercontinental  ballistic  missiles.  Others have said we had such an enor mous  lead on the Soviets that they  could never catch up, and there is that  famous statement by the head of the  Patents Department that he was re signing because nothing more could be  discovered. But defense against nucle ar weapons is a matter of enormous  importance.  The proposal which has been ad vanced by Senator BINGAMAN and Sen ator SHELBY has within its framework  the strict interpretation of the ABM  Treaty and I  think that is a funda mental flaw.  I have had occasion to  study in some depth the ABM Treaty  and it is my legal judgment that the  broad interpretation rather than the  narrow interpretation is correct.  This is an involved subject and re grettably we have limited time here.  The  subject matter of  the ABM  Treaty is a very complicated one and  there is limited time here this morning  and I know my colleagues are anxious  to conclude and there are planes to be  caught so I will be very brief and try  to condense my remarks on this sub ject.  The negotiating record is plain that  the United States  and  the Soviet  Union on the ABM Treaty had intend ed the broad interpretation. It is true  that in the ratification record there  were a  limited number of comments  made in representations to the Senate  looking toward the narrow interpreta tion.  We have  the anomalous  situation  that the treaty really is what the par ties negotiate, the United States exec utive branch on one hand negotiating  with the Soviet Union, and they con cluded a treaty with the broad inter pretation. Then you have the subse quent  practice  under  constitutional  law of the United States where the  treaty has to be ratified by the Senate  and it may be that there is a different  understanding between the executive  branch and the Senate on the narrow  interpretation. Frankly I do not think  so. But there is grounds for that kind  of a contention.  So, Mr. President,  you  have  the  anomalous situation where you have  the negotiations between the United  States executive and Soviet Union on  the broad interpretation and perhaps  a ratification process on the narrow in terpretation which puts  the United  States at a disadvantage.  But I believe, taking the record as a  whole, the negotiating record, the rati fication  record  and  the  subsequent  practices of the parties, that a fair in terpretation  is  the broad interpreta",1990
1199,1036,16,Mr. WALLOP.," Mr. President, let me  quote from that letter.  It said: ""In many ways this is more  serious than a funding cut,"" speaking  of the Bingaman-Shelby amendmentAs Congress imposes cuts in the Defense  Budget, at the very least, I need flexibility  to manage  our  programs. Moreover,  it  makes little sense to force us to forego real istic tests of promising SDI technologies.  As you and your colleagues consider the  Defense Bill, I hope you will take into ac count the tremendous progress and promise  of SDI, and will provide us with the means  to manage an effective program. SDI will be  among the most important factors  in my  evaluation of  the Defense Authorization  Bill.  Mr. President, there have been a lot  of strawman arguments and other mis information  scattered  around  and  about here. Let me suggest that things  have changed since SDI made its de termination that phase II would have  to be ready before a commitment to  phase I, speaking to the remarks of  the Senator from Georgia. Phase I is  more robust than the phase I architecture of 3 years ago because of Brilliant  Pebbles, and it can kill missiles much  cheaper. The countermeasure environ ment is entirely different than it was  then. We no longer expect the same  countermeasures because of stark con straints in costs. Scientists from Los  Alamos also point out that the new  neutral particle beam system, not as a  weapon but a discrimination sensor,  will extend  the vitality of Brilliant  Pebbles against robust decoys.  I also point out that under START  constraints Brilliant Pebbles is cost ef fectively  overaugmented  to meet  a  robust  threat.  The  administration  would like to spend more on phase II  but Congress once again keeps cutting  the funding and keeps denying us this  promise.  Mr. President, we are at a crossroads  and  this debate has  illuminated the  choice. It is a basic choice as to wheth er or not the American people will be  allowed  to reap  the harvest of this  technology, or whether they will only  be allowed to reap the harvest of poli tics which will create a sort of white  collar entitlement fund.  That is where we are. Will we def end  with real things to shoot down real  missiles that are really in the world, or  will we simply continue to do what his torically we have done in the past, to  get a morsel of meat about  to be  brought in from the kitchen and in stead see it diverted, and get only an other bowl of polenta? Will we accept  politically arrived at costs, like Sena tor NuNN's figures of $123 billion, a  construct figure that does not reflect  the GAO study any more than it re flects the SDI and Department of De fense studies? And if that is the case,  and costs are the problem, I say again  to my colleagues, why spend anything  at all? If we cannot develop and deploy  technology why not just abandon it, if  we cannot afford  it when  it comes  down here?  The question really is can we afford  to survive? The  threat  is  real, and  both sides have acknowledged  that.  We agree. All of us in here agree that  Israel deserves and has real need for  an ATBM capability as quickly as pos sible. Mr. President,  I agree. But if  Israel needs protection, why deny it to  the American people when we have  both the same right to be def ended  and the same threat lying on the door step.  Would the sponsors simply by way  of closing  tell  the American people  why they should be denied a defense  and yet why we should help supply  Israel with her own defense? The  Bingaman-Shelby  amendment  pro vides no timetable for U.S. defense. It  provides no promise of any concrete  technical achievement. It provides no  goal, only more study. Once again, on  the threshold of technical success, we  retreat from doing anything useful.  So history is repeating itself. So long  as  Congress  denies  the American  people the ability to achieve the har vest of the progress of America's tech nological investment, so then will the  Congress fail the American people in  the responsibility which it owes them.  America will suffer, the d:.nger will  grow and, only thing that will grow in  addition will be a welfare program for  hometown constituents. The $400 mil lion taken out of the Phase I architec ture goes to the labs of the States of  the two sponsors. It is basically noth ing more than that-denying us capa bility, crippling our arms control proc ess, which in fact I state again was the  position of Secretaries Shevardnadze  and Baker that we need a more stable  balance  between  offenses  and  de fenses.

1202,1036,16,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President,  it  is  with regret that I respond to the com ments of my distinguished colleague  from Wyoming, because we have his torically been on the same side on SDI  debates. However, his comments  re flect several misconceptions about the  intent and provisions of this amend ment, which I feel compelled to clear  up.  First, I was opposed to any reduction  of the administration's budget request  for SDI. However, I receded to the ma jority view that defense cuts had to be  made and  that SDI should not be  immune to such cuts. In the past, I  have managed  the  floor debate on  behalf  of  the  proponents  of SDI  against attempts to cut back SDI. I be lieve that my record is clear on this  issue.  I agree with the Senator's desire to  see  the program produce an actual,  near-term defense capability. This is  why the amendment funds treaty-com pliant systems at the requested level  and provides almost $50 million in ad ditional funding for theater missile de fense systems. The need for the en hancement of our theater missile de fense work has never been more clear ly demonstrated than by the events of  the past few days.  I am concerned that we do not vio late the ABM Treaty process. If we de velop, test, or deploy a system contain ing space-based weapons, we  clearly  violate  the  treaty;  therefore,  the  amendment calls for deferral of de ployment of the Phase I system, con taining thousands of space-based bril liant pebbles, and adherence to the re strictions on development and testing  of space weapons. Only one ground based site, with 100 interceptors, is al lowed by the treaty, and the amend",1990
1203,1049,16,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I yield 2  minutes to the Senator from Virginia.  ",1990
1204,1049,16,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President. I have  great respect for my colleague from  Massachusetts. but he is indeed trying  to have it both ways. This is not a  question of patriotism, who  served,  who has not served in the uniforms of  this country. This is simply a question  of whether or not we are going  to  abide by a decision earlier made by  this body with reference to the SDI, to  make a major change in the program  as enunciated by  the distinguished  chairman as a consequence of earlier  votes and other work that will tran spire  in the conference between the  House and the Senate.  Mr. President, we are asking that  this program not be made the banker  for  the problems of  this country.  I  share with my distinguished colleague,  having just visited the VA hospitals in  Virginia, I share with him the prob lems  inflicted on our society by the  consequences of drugs.  We are making basic decisions here  today with respect to the future of our  security and that of our allies and of  our friends.  As the Senator from Virginia point ed out earlier today, and the Senator  endorsed in his amendment, we need  greater emphasis placed on the tacti cal ballistic missile deterrence, both  for ourselves and our friends and our  allies. and that deterrence is derived  from  this  account on which he  is  asking us  to bank  funds  for  these  other problems which merit attention.  But I  suggest enough attention has  been given in 1 day on this particular  line-item of the defense bill.  ",1990
1205,1049,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Who  yields time?  Mr~ KERRY. Mr. President, I yield  to the Senator from Iowa 8 minutes.  ",1990
1206,1049,16,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I want  to again join with Senator KERRY in  offering our amendment, and I associ ate myself with the eloquent remarks  he has made. As a member of the Ap propriations  Subcommittee  on De fense that appropriates money under  this authorization, I want to compli ment both the distinguished Senator  from Georgia, Senator NUNN, and the  distinguished ranking member, Sena tor WARNER, and other members of the  Armed Service Committee for what I  think is a giant step forward in this  bill,  cutting out MX  rail  garrison,  which I think is a major step. Cutting  the Milstar Program is another major  step.  The Senator from Georgia made us  ""fly before we buy,"" another step in  the right direction. I only hoped that  we  had  applied  that  to  the B-2  bomber. But be that as it may, these  are steps in the right direction.  The  fact  that  that budget  came  down from $306 to $289 billion is again  sending a strong signal to the Penta gon  that  the nineties are different  than the eighties. We are beginning to  shift priorities.  We have not made enough of a shift  and  are  still proceeding down  the  wrong road. The SDI Program,  like  many others, when it was shown  it  would not accomplish its initial pur pose and task, then it begins to look  for different missions.  First  it was  to complicate Soviet  attack plans, then to stop an acciden tal  launch, and now  to stop Third  World threats. It just keeps switching  missions.  Again I associate myself with the re marks of the Senator from Massachu setts. The biggest threat to our nation al  security  right now,  the  biggest  threat to our way of life and biggest  threat to the next generation of young  Americans  is not a ballistic missile  threat from the Soviet Union or any  Third World country, it is the threat  of the influx of drugs into this coun try.  We are still fighting the old dead  cold war with obsolete weapons and  the biggest relic is star wars.  What our amendment does, as Sena tor KERRY pointed out, is  to make a  shift to two accounts, fighting the war  on drugs and helping to meet our com mitment to our veterans' hospitals.  As chairman of the appropriations  subcommittee  that  funds  alcohol,  drug, and mental health programs in  this country, I will wager right now I  have a  letter  in my  file  from  just  about every Senator, requesting that I  increase money for alcohol and drug  abuse programs  in every State and  mental health program. Because you  have heard from your States and are  requesting help in fighting the threat  of drugs both in education, treatment,  rehabilitation, and in the other areas  of law enforcement and prosecution.  I am going to do my best, but I must  tell you we do not have enough money  to meet all the requests that come in  to increase alcohol, drug, and mental  health programs around the country.  So if you would like to have a shift  and to make sure we can put some  more money to send out to the States  through  these programs,  then I ask  for your support for the Kerry-Harkin  amendment, a shift of $400 million.  As Senator KERRY  said,  it  is not  going to kill star wars; but a shift of  $200 million to the war on drugs, $200  million into the veterans health pro grams, can make a big difference in  both those programs.  My  distinguished  colleague  from  Massachusetts has talked a lot about  the drug program and the threat of  drugs.  I want  to  focus on another  aspect. Senator KERRY  did mention  the problem we have with veterans  hospitals, where they are not getting  adequate medical care. He is absolute ly  right. When veterans  agreed  to  serve in the Armed Forces they were  told  the Nation would  take care of  their medical needs. We have honored  the commitment for many years. Tens  of thousands of veterans have received  VA care in centers across the Nation.  They came  to depend on  immediate  service. They did not need private  health insurance. they had a commit ment from  the Federal Government  that their medical needs would be met.  Now, as many of the veterans are re quiring more health care due to age,  the rug is being pulled out from un derneath  them.  Under  economy  moves, some VA medical centers have  stopped outpatient service to some cat egory A, category B, and category C  veterans. In many cases these veterans  have been receiving outpatient serv ices including medicine and other serv ice  for years. They have no private  health insurance. Many are too ill and  too old  to get private health  insur ance. And many could not afford it  even if they qualified.  But I want  to  take my remaining  time to tell you about one such veter an from Waterloo, IA, to drive home  my point. His name is Jack Stone. He  was  a  J7-year-old marine  in  poor  health.  Jack Stone had diabetes. He lost his  leg to the disease in 1986, but the VA  medical center in Iowa City was there  to help him.  Jack Stone was also crippled by ar thritis of the spine, but the VA medi cal center was there to help him.  Jack Stone had hardening of the ar teries, but the VA medical center was  there to help him.  His kidneys began failing  in 1988.  But the VA medical center was there  to help him: He began dialysis there in  1989.  By January of this year, Jack Stone  received outpatient dialysis treatment  twice a week, and took 16 different  medications at a cost of about $200 per  month. But the VA paid for his medi cal  treatment, fulfilling  the commit ment we made to all our veterans.  However. on January 30, while re ceiving his dialysis  treatment,  Jack  ",1990

Very briefly, Mr. President, this in volves a matter called the joint strate gic environmental research program,  which sets up a council and a board  and is  in the authorization bill. The  Armed Services staff worked with the  Environment and Public Works Com mittee staff to work out a nomination  that is agreed to. At 3 o'clock in the  morning my staff  found  there was  going to be an amendment offered, the  first notice we ever received of  the  amendment. Unfortunately, my staff  was not  consulted  in  drafting  the  amendment.  My objections are, No.  l, that the  amendment very significantly changes  the scope and authority of the council  which, in my judgment, involves mat ters that should be properly in the En vironment and Public Works Commit tee.  Two, it changes the control of the  council from more of an independent  council directed under the control of  the DOD and DOE. That does not, I  think, comport well with the original  intent of the council.  I hope that the Senator from Louisi ana and the chairman of the commit tee can work out the joint problems  between the Energy Committee and  Armed Services, but I also hope the  conference report does not encroach  upon the jurisdiction of the Environ ment and Public Works Committee.

A great deal of  work has been done in developing the  legislation to create the Strategic En vironmental  Restoration  Research  Program.  This program will utilize some of the  resources of the existing defense es tablishment to address critical energy  and environmental concerns. The de fense complex has a unique and sub stantial technical capability that can,  and should play an important role in  improving the scientific knowledge as sociated with many  environmental  programs.  The National Laboratories can con tribute  significantly  to  our  under standing  of  critical  environmental  issues  including global change, envi ronmental clean up and overall energy  security.  Negotiations have been taking place  over the past several months, however  all interested parties are still not in  agreement on  several key  elements  surrounding  the creation and oper ation of the program.  From my standpoint, it is very im portant  that  the  legislation  include  the Waste Minimization  Program.  This research initiative holds tremen dous promise. As we approach the 21st  century we need to develop new tech nologies that will generate a smaller  amount of waste or wastes that will be  less hazardous. We need to rethink our  nuclear  and  chemical  processes  in  order to reduce the amount of waste  produced as a byproduct. This pro gram could be  the ways and means  toward that objective. I say could be cause although it has been proposed,  ",1990
1226,1075,16,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of this legislation, which has  been appropriately described as  the  first post cold war defense budget.  This year I took two trips to central  Europe. Visiting East Berlin in March,  I walked across a barren field that had  recently been littered with land mines,  barbed wire and machineguns. On the  day of my visit the land was a boule vard between East and West Germany.  In late May and early June, I visited  Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia  and witnessed  the  excitement,  the  fervor, and also the difficulties of the  fundamental political, economic and  social transformations there. I also vis ited Romania, which is an entirely dif ferent story.  The substance of what we have de bated here through the past days has  plenty to do with what I experienced  in these central European countries.  The dislocations we face in moving to  the next stage of our defense posture  is  in some ways as profound as the  wholesale  revisions  taking place  in  central Europe and the Soviet Union.  The changes for the United States and  central Europe are both promising,  present great potential for economic  growth and world peace, and both are  fraught with dangers.  One danger is that we may overin terpret the nature and permanence of  the changes in the Soviet Union and  relax our defenses too soon. In spite of  the breathtaking changes, the Soviets  have not reduced their forces signifi cantly-certainly  not  their  most  threatening strategic forces.  On  the other hand,  the elements  that make up the military threat from  a potential adversary go significantly  beyond hardware. While the Soviets'  hardware remains intact, their ongo ing withdrawal from central Europe  and the general disintegration of the  previously existing political and social  regimentation and military discipline  has  already  seriously  reduced  the  actual threat from the Soviet Union.  As usual in political situations, we  can err here on two sides. One error  would be  to  ignore  the monumental  changes  in the east bloc and go on  building weapons as  if nothing has  happened. The opposite error would  be  to see only the changes, and to  ignore the possibility of a reversal or a  lengthy period of uncertainty in the  struggle between the old and the new  in the Soviet Union. In other words,  we would not want to disarm too fast  too soon.  Remember, we made  this mistake  after both World Wars. After the first,  we  immediately  disengaged  from  Europe, spurned  the League of Na tions, and thereby indirectly contrib uted to the rise of Nazism in Germa ny-or, at least, were not in a good po sition to prevent it.  We withdrew our forces prematurely  after the Second World War as well.  By doing that, we were not in the posi tion to pressure Stalin to live up to the  Yalta agreements, and central Europe  fell prey to a 40-year-long Soviet co lonialization.  Just as we started to debate this leg islation,  another powerful  reminder  jolted our  collective  conscious,  the  Iraqi  dictator's  brazen  aggression  against Kuwait.  It  starkly brought  home the message that beyond any su perpower detente this world remains a  very dangerous place, the Middle East  a particularly volatile part of it, and  our strategic considerations will have  to be reoriented instead of relaxed or  abandoned.  So while some reduction in our de fense spending and some  rearrange ment in our force posture is in order,  we need to go about it prudently, pur suing our security interests in light of  the hard realities of the actual world.  We need to go about it prudently for  two reasons. A reduction in our de fense spending has costs and benefits.  The benefits are twofold: a lower Fed eral deficit from reduced spending and  an opportunity to divert defense sav ings to fund nondef ense capital invest ments with long-term benefits for our  Nation.  The costs are most relevant to this  discussion. Simply put, a reduction in  defense  spending will  result  in  lost  jobs and failing businesses. Members  of Congress are elated about reduced  East-West tensions, but we are deeply  concerned about the potential loss of  jobs  for  thousands of hardworking  Americans employed  in  the defense  sector.  The question that we must address  today and for many months to come  is-what will  reductions  in defense  spending mean for regions where the  defense industry is so important to the  well-being of the local economy?  The unavoidable fact is that we are  going to face some very painful dislo cations  in the near future-program  terminations, sharp reductions in unit  numbers  ordered  by  the military,  stretch-outs,  local  unemployment,  plant closings.  Mr. President,  in my State, Con necticut, where our  skilled workers  have  contributed  so much  to  the  safety of this Nation, we are already  feeling real pain. One example is pro vided by  the UNC Naval Products  plant in Uncasville, CT. This splendid  facility has built nuclear propulsion  As a  systems  for our  submarines  for 34  years. I wish all of my colleagues could  visit this plant to see for themselves  what amount . of quality of  training,  tooling, technological expertise, orga nization and elaborate security goes  into producing such a crucial piece of  frontline  technology. This is a zero error environment. A submarine nucle ar powerplant must never break down  and none built at UNC ever have.  result of our reduced rate of  submarine construction, the Navy an nounced that it is phasing out the con tibution of the UNC plant. All that  technology, craftsmanship, and disci pline is threatened to be wasted, the  workers laid off.    The point I want to make is that the  causes of this dislocation lie in the de velopment of world politics and the  subsequent decisions of our national  leadership. They are not due to the  fault  of our workers of managers.  They are not due to bad business deci sions,  low productivity or inadequate  workmanship. As a result, I strongly  feel that the Federal Government has  strong responsibilities to help to ease  these dislocations and assist the veter ans of the cold war-America's defense  workers-to a  smooth  transition,  to  avoid undeserved hardships.  I strongly disagree with those who  claim that this is just a normal turn in  the ups and downs of doing business in  a free market economy. Some facilities  in my state, such as the Pratt & Whit ney jet engine factory, have always op erated in part on the free market, in  part in government business. To state,  however, that facilities such as UNC  Naval Products, or the Electric Boat  Submarine yard, ever operated on the  free market is  laughable. They have  had only one customer, the Govern ment of the United States, and their  whole operation has been hogtied into  government  regulations and  require ments. These facilities could not have  diversified  into alternative activities  even if they wanted to; it is inconceiv able that the Navy would have allowed  that. Many of these defense workers  for all practical purposes worked for  the Federal Government. The demand  for their skills, for their product had  nothing to do with the free market; it  was subject to the policy decisions of  Government officials only.  Mr. President, I  thought it impor tant to lay out the case for the dislo cated defense workers because  their  plight  is  sometimes  too  easily dis missed as a minor side effect of the  coming of eternal world peace, and be cause I think we have a strong respon sibility to these veterans. If we ever re alize what  is  fashionably called  the  peace dividend, our defense workers,  who produced it. should be at the head  of  the  line.  I  really hope  that my  friends, the chairman and the ranking  member of the Armed Services Com",1990

AUXILIARY FLIGHT SERVICE STATION PRO GRAM.  <a> GENERAL RULE.-The Administrator of  the Federal Aviation Administration shall  develop and implement a system of manned  auxiliary flight service stations. The auxilia ry flight service stations shall supplement  the services of the planned consolidation to  61 automated flight service stations under  the flight service station modernization pro gram. Auxiliary flight service stations shall  be located in areas of unique weather or  operational conditions which are critical to  the safety of flight.  (b) REPORT TO CONGRESS.-Not later than  180 days after the date of enactment of this  Act, the Administrator of the Federal Avia tion Administration shall report to Congress  with the plan and schedule for implementa tion of this section.  ",1990
1234,1166,16,Mr. FORD.," Mr. President, I want to  commend the distinguished chairman  and ranking member on  their good  work in seeing the transportation ap propriations bill through. I also would  like to add my support to the amend ment to establish an auxiliary flight  service station program. These flight  service stations would provide impor tant weather information to all pilots,  information critical to safe flight.  The legislation would mandate that  the Federal Aviation Administration  report back to Congress with a list of  manned flight service stations to be  kept open, above and beyond the 61  automated FSS's scheduled to remain  when the current FAA consolidation  program  is  completed  in 1993. The  auxiliary stations are to be located in  areas of unique weather or operations  conditions-such as mountainous  re gions or along the coast. Those areas  where bad weather is prone to crop up  at a moment's notice.  This program is not a plan to save  all of the remaining 143 flight service  stations that are awaiting consolida tion. Actually,  it's an  idea borrowed  from former FAA Administrator, Adm.  Don Engen. During his tenure at the  FAA, the admiral testified on a few oc casions to the fact that he expected to  see more than 61 FSS's remain at the  end of the consolidation program. He  stressed that we need more  than a  piece of automated equipment or an  hourly weather observation  in  these  areas of rapidly changing weather con ditions. We  need  the  expertise  of  trained  professionals  familiar with  local weather conditions.  Weather is the single greatest cause  of  aviation  accidents.  This  small  amendment will go a long way toward  helping pilots get complete, accurate  and up-to-date weather  information,  and  in  turn  improving  the overall  safety record.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in  support of the amendment that would  authorize an auxiliary set of flight  service stations [FSSl, to supplement  the weather services provided by 61  automated  flight  service  stations  scheduled to be on line by the end of  1993.  The Federal Aviation Administra tion  flight service station consolida tion program was first implemented in  1981. This program has been criticized  from its inception. While some of this  criticism  reflected a  lack of under standing of the program, some of it  was well-founded. This is particulary  true where unique weather or oper ational conditions exist. The auxiliary  FSS's mandated under this provision  would  be  retained  in  these  areas.  These areas can't be served adequately  by automated facilities which can be  located hundreds of miles away.  Pilots depend on accurate and timely  weather  information,  particulary  when they plan to travel through re gions with  characteristically  harsh  conditions, or areas known  to have  storm systems move in quickly and un expectedly. The obvious examples are  mountainous and coastal regions.  The additional stations would allow  pilots  the accessibility  they need  to  draw on the observations and advice of  trained weather professionals,  in re gions of rapidly changing weather con ditions. The auxiliary  flight  service  station program would strike a better  balance between the need to stream line the FSS organization, and recog nize the diversity of the country's ge ography and weather.  There have been some questions re garding the scope of this amendment  and I would like to ask the subcommit tee chairman if he could clarify a few  points.  ",1990
1235,1166,16,Mr. LAUTENBERG., I will certainly  try.  Mr. McCAIN. It is the Senator's view  that this provision is intended to give  the Administrator the broadest discre tion in deciding whether a particular  site needs some form of continued FSS  service?  ,1990
1236,1166,16,Mr. LAUTENBERG., Yes it is.  Mr. McCAIN. Does  the chairman  construe this provision as mandating  any specific number of facilities?  ,1990
1237,1166,16,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," I would like to  make it clear that the provision is only  intended to give flexibility to FAA to  deviate from its current consolidation  program, as it decides is necessary for  safety  purposes  in  its  professional  judgment.  Mr. McCAIN. Will  the  chairman  press this view in conference?  ",1990
1238,1166,16,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Yes,  it would  be my intention that the conference  report language makes it clear that we  are not trying to restrict the F AA's  safety  experts but  rather  that we  intend  to assure  that FAA has all  flexibility it needs to see that safety is  not adversely impacted.  I thank the chairman. I appreciate  the good work of the chairman and  ranking member on  the  fiscal year  1991  Transportation  appropriations  bill, and urge my colleagues to support  the bill and this amendment.

I am pleased we can  recognize such an outstanding individ ual for his dedication and professional ism.  SOCIAL SECURITY AND DEFICIT  REDUCTION  ",1990
1245,1179,16,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, before  we  leave  for our August  recess,  I  wanted to address the issue of Social  Security and deficit reduction.  It has been reported from time to  time  that negotiators at the budget  summit are considering cutting Social  Security benefits as a part of a deficit  reduction plan. One of the options dis cussed would freeze or delay the cost of-living adjustment or COLA that el derly and disabled Social Security re cipients are scheduled to receive Janu ary l, 1991.  Mr. President, no single function of  Government affects as many Ameri cans as profoundly as Social Security  does. Nearly 40 million retirees, dis abled workers, their spouses and chil dren, including 518,000 Iowans, receive  a Social Security check each month.  Social Security is the primary source  of  income  for  70  percent of older  Americans, and it is virtually the sole  source of  income for almost one  in  three older persons.  Some may say, ""Just delaying the  COLA's isn't really a benefit cut. That  isn't so bad."" Well, let us look at real  life. Because in real life, a delay is a  cut in income to our seniors. And not  just for  this year, because a cut  in  their  income  this year means  less  income in the year to come as well.  In budget  terms,  eliminating  this  year's COLA for Social Security and  railroad  retirement  recipients would  mean a $7 .6 billion cut  in benefits.  Even more onerous, it would cut bene fits by over $49 billion over the next 5  years.  In human terms, and that is what is  most important here, eliminating the  COLA would hurt our most economi cally vulnerable seniors the most. A  recent  study by  the Families USA  Foundation,  found  that  a  1-year  COLA's  freeze would  push 368,000  older Americans permanently below  the poverty level-$6,820 for an indi vidual and $8,420  for a couple. Fur ther, they found that another 420,000  older Americans would  be  thrown  below 150 percent of the poverty level.  In my own State of Iowa, over 3,500  seniors would be forced into poverty.  Since most older persons live on tight fixed incomes, carefully planning out  each dollar, this cut will mean having  to  choose between giving up heat,  medications, or food. Because the cost  of all of these necessities, especially  health care, will increase while their  incomes stay flat.  Mr. President, Social Security did  not cause the deficit. It should not be  used to solve it. The deficit summit ne gotiators have a tough task. Any cuts  are bound to be in some way contro versial. But we cannot accept forcing  older Americans to bear the brunt of a  problem  they didn't create. That  is  why if a deficit reduction plan comes  before us that cuts or eliminates the  seniors' or the disabled's COLA, I will  have to ask that there be a separate  up or down vote on this provision. So  that it is perfectly clear what is being  done.  EXPLANATION OF ABSENCE  ",1990
1246,1179,16,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, the senior  Senator from New Mexico  [Mr. Do MENrcrl missed several votes this after noon.  Since it was not clear whether the  Senate was going to hold a Saturday  session until yesterday,  the Senator  had made a commitment to meet with  various  constituent  groups  in New  Mexico. He canceled one meeting with  the Association for Retarded Citizens.  He really felt badly about missing this  appointment. It has been scheduled  for a long time.  He did delay his departure so that  he could be here for the SDI debate.  SDI, as most of my colleagues know, is  very important to New Mexico because  of the extensive SDI research carried  out at Los Alamos and Sandia Nation al Laboratories. Senator DoMENrcr de layed his departure in order to partici pate in the debate.  However, the Senate was hours from  completing its work and rather than  disappoint other constituents he had  planned to meet with, he caught the 2  p.m. plane to Albuquerque. This would  permit him to arrive for the last of his  scheduled appointments for today.  SOCIAL SECURITY NOTCH  ",1990
1247,1179,16,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President,  ap proximately  10  million  Americans  have been waiting 13  long years for  Congress to address the Social Securi ty notch-a glitch  in the law which  has reduced the benefits of individuals  born between 1917 and 1926.  As a result of the 1977 amendments  to the Social Security Act, individuals  born between 1917 and 1926  receive  substantially lower benefits than indi viduals born in earlier years. This re duction in benefits has caused suffer ing among older Americans, many of  whom depend on their Social Security  check to keep them out of poverty.  There  are  approximately  130,000  Iowans affected by the notch. When I  came to the Senate 6 years ago, I made  notch correction legislation a priority  and I have supported and cosponsored  legislation over the years which will  provide relief to these individuals in a  fiscally responsible manner.

1248,1257,16,Mr. GORE.," Mr. President, it is  in creasingly apparent that many of the  serious environmental problems  that  we see are not restricted to a given  area,  region or country, and are  in  fact, interregional or international. It  is encouraging to see that the atten tion of the international community is  being  increasingly directed  to  these  issues and to the need to develop co operative  and  support programs  to  deal with them.  A  recent article by Robert Cahn  from the summer issue of 1990 Amicus  Journal entitled ""The Globetrotters""  discusses these issues and some of the  current efforts to deal with them.  Mr. Cahn attended and his article  discusses  the  recent  Interparliamen tary Conference on the Global Envi ronment, which the Senate had the  honor to host and I had the honor to  chair. I believe that this article will be  of interest to my colleagues.  The material follows:  [From the Amicus, Journal, Summer 19901  THE GLOBETROTI'ERS  <By Robert Cahn>  It would appear that arms control is out  and global environmental solutions are in as  legislative priorities worldwide. ""We need to  put and end to the arms race and convert it  into a race for stabilizing the natural bal ance and preserving the environment: The  new problem is to translate the environmen tal problem from the scientific question into  a political question and the central political  strategy of our time."" That statement by  Hermann Scheer, a member of  the West  German Bundestag, heralds the new priori ty among nations, as expressed at the recent  Interparliamentary Conference on Global  Environment <ICGE>.  Scheer was one of 170  legislators  from  thirty-six nations convening in Washington  this spring for working sessions aimed at  finding legislative solutions to global envi ronmental problems.  In September, 1989,  fifty-five  legislators from seventeen coun tries had met  for  the same purpose  in  Tokyo. This June, members of the Europe an Parliament, the Japanese Diet, and the  U.S. Congress tackled global climate change,  biodiversity  of  species,  ocean  pollution,  toxic waste, and a host of other environ mental challenges that know no national  boundaries. Also in June, another group of  environmental legislators met in Bellagio,  Italy.  These conferences tap and strengthen the  growing  awarness  among  legislators  throughout the the world that a shift in po litical priorities is under way, a redefining of  national security  in environmental rather  than military terms. The old fear that a few  national leaders with fingers on the nuclear  button might change the face of the planet  is being replaced by a new call for tangible  laws and actions to avert disastrous global  warming,  reduce air and water polution,  protect  the world  from  toxic wastes and  chemical and nuclear contaminants, pre serve threatened plant and animal species  and  their habitats, and slow  the pace of  population growth.  At  the World Environment Legislators  Forum <WELF> in Tokyo last year, most of  the meeting was  taken up with presenta tions by parliamentarians on environmental  problems in their own countries-mainly air  and water pollution and  toxic waste-al though other environmental problems were  discussed. The  forum, organized by Diet  member Takashi Kosugi, and supported by  a grant from the Sasakawa Peace Founda tion, was  dominated  by  the  Japanese.  Twenty members of the Diet from six politi cal parties attended, while the other nations  were each represented by only one legisla tor.  Representative  James Scheuer <D-New  York> took part in the Tokyo meeting, and  a year earlier had addressed the European  Parliament on the need to start an organiza tion of parliamentarians from industrialized  nations  to deal with the environment. In  November 1989, Scheuer, Senators Al Gore  <D-Tennessee),  John Heinz <R-Pennsylva nia>. and a dozen colleagues met in Wash ington with fifteen legislators from the Eu ropean Parliament to form Global Legisla tors Organized for a Balanced Environment  <GLOBE>. This June, Scheuer, Heinz, and  Represenative Constance Morella <R-Mary land) met in Brussels with European Parlia ment  legislators and six members of  the  Japanese Diet for a second GLOBE session.  Among actions taken was an agreement to  work for a ban on the export of toxic wastes  to Third World countries. GLOBE has invit ed the Soviet Union to join, and expects to  meet twice a year. Small teams of GLOBE  members have been formed  to deal with  some of the environmental issues, exchange  information, and highlight problems and  potential legislative actions to solve them.  Also in June, legislators met in Bellagio to  form a Planetary Partnership Coalition for  Environment and Development to help de veloping and industrialized countries work  together on the global environmental crisis.  The  legislators passed  resolutions  recom mending actions by their respective coun tries on global climate change and other  issues. The Bellagio workshop, attended by  twenty-five legislators from thirteen coun tries, was sponsored by the Global Environ ment Program of the New York-based Par liamentarians  for Global Action, which  until recently had been working mainly on  disarmament, peace, international debt, and  monetary reform.  Also, an ad hoc, seven-member committee  on the environment of the Interparliamen tary Union <IPU> has been formed and is  working to develop issues and proposals for  the 1992 Conference on Environment and  Development in Brazil.  The largest and most comprehensive of  these environmental  initiatives by  legisla tors was the April conference in Washing ton, which was hosted by the U.S. Senate  and organized and chaired by Gore with  help from Senate colleagues John Chafee  <R-Rhode Island), Heinz, Rudy Boschwitz  <R-Minnesota), John Kerry <D-Massachu setts), Tim Wirth (D-Colorado), and Max  Baucus <D-Montana>.  As the leading global environmentalist in  Congress, Gore  introduced  legislation au thorizing the conference, and won approval  for $500,000  in Senate funding. He is  the  author of several bills now before Congress,  including  the World Environment Policy  Act, which addresses virtually all areas of  the global environment: a package of legis lation addressing protection of the strato spheric ozone layer; a resolution that would  protect Antarctica from mining and miner als development and preserve the continent  as a global ecological commons; and a bill  for a Strategic Environmental Initiative fo cusing on developing marketing, and export ing  technologies that will allow economic  growth to continue in an environmentally  sustainable manner.  When industrial and Third World nations  having  democratically  elected members  were  invited to send delegations of up to  seven members of their legislative bodies to  the ICGE conference, the Senate sponsors  were worried that it might not draw high  level participants. They need not have been  concerned. Five heads of senates or national  assemblies, two former prime ministers, and  more than a dozen legislators who are lead ing activists on environmental  legislative  committees were among the 170 delegates.  In his opening charge to the conference,  Gore predicted that in the 1990s, the effort  to save the world's environment will emerge  as  the  central  organizing  principle  for  achieving and safeguarding human progress.  ""For the first time, all humankind stands  united  in  the face of destruction of  the  earth's ecological  system which  supports  life as we have known it,"" Gore said. ""The  fear  of  self-annihilation  draws  us  even  closer, perhaps, than did the threat of nu clear holocaust. The decisions to avoid nu clear war rest primarily in the hands of a  few leaders in a handful of nations. But the  choice to save our global environment will  be made not by the few but by the many billions of us on our own and with each  other. The issues involved in living in bal ance with the earth's natural systems will  demand scientific advances and tax the in genuity of decision makers,"" he added. ""But  they are, at bottom, political challenges be cause real progress on the environment in evitably requires important changes in soci ety. If prime ministers or presidents cannot  or will not provide environmental  leader ship, then with or without them, the elected  representatives of the peoples of the world  will do whatever  it  takes  to protect  the  global environment.""  Responding to Gore's keynote, French Na tional Assembly president Laurent Fabius  affirmed  that  the  two great  interrelated  questions of the twenty-first century will be  the environment and development. ""These  questions will not be solved spontaneously,  but by voluntary, organized, directed action  taken by men and women who think not  only in terms of individuals, but in terms of  mankind,"" Fabius said. ""We must address  these  two major questions  in our parlia ments because they do not have any solu tions outside of democracy. The time has  come for the parliaments of each nation to  deal with the environment together.""  The conferees put in long, full days. In  small working groups  they  thrashed out  goals and devised proposals and strategies,  then debated the proposed actions in plena ry sessions until reaching consensus on the  issues. The legislators passed a number of  general, and a few significant, specific pro posals for action. And they established net works for continuing the dialogue and help ing one another draft and perfect national  legislation and develop international coop eration strategies for global treaties wherev",1990

1265,1335,16,Mr. MOAKLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  last  month another round in the negotia tions between the Government of El  Salvador and  the opposition FMLN  was held in San Jose, Costa Rica. The  goal of the negotiations is a peace! ul  settlement to a  long and brutal war  that has already claimed over 70,000  lives.  Unfortunately the negotiations last  month did not go well. Almost no  progress was made on the key issue of  military reform. The FMLN's proposal  on  this subject was particularly ex treme and unrealistic and provided no  opportunity  for  the United Nations  mediator to bring the two sides closer  together.  Another  round of negotiations  is  scheduled to begin next week. I hope  that the FMLN position will be more  flexible at that time, and that the me diators will be encouraged by both  sides, to develop proposals aimed at es tablishing a middle ground.  I also condemn, in the strongest pos sible terms, FMLN threats of another  military  offensive. The  Salvadoran  people are sick of war, and sick of  people, who talk of nothing but war.  In this connection, I think it ironic  that last May, this House voted to pro vide strong incentives for the FMLN  to refrain from a new offensive, to re frain from purchasing arms, to refrain  from attacks against civilians, and to  negotiate in good faith.  The  administration  opposed  that  plan and, as a result, those incentives  are not now in law. I only hope that  the administration's opposition to the  proposal, which was offered by Rep.  JOHN MURTHA and myself, does not  lead inadvertently to further violence  in El Salvador.  And  I  hope  that we will,  in  the  weeks ahead, pass legislation that will  provide  strong  incentives  for  both  sides in El Salvador to respect human  rights and to end this senseless war.  I would also add that I am encour aged by the administration's willing ness to attempt to reach an accommo dation on this issue with the Congress,  and  I  am  confident  in  the weeks  ahead. This will happen.  FURLOUGHING OF FEDERAL  EMPLOYEES  <Mr. PARRIS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1990
1266,1335,16,Mr.  PARRIS.," Mr.  Speaker,  once  again, Federal employees have become  the scapegoats of our seriously trou bled budget process. Over and over  again, this country's civil servants are  threatened by the legislature tamper ing with their retirement funds, not  receiving cost of  living adjustments,  and  just plain  lack of  respect. The  most recent slap in the face is the pro posal to furlough Federal employees.  Does anyone really believe that it is  fair  to balance  the budget on  the  backs of Government workers?  Furloughing Federal employees for  up to 22 days is not simply a blow to  morale. Our Nation's 2.4 million civil  servants are paying mortgages, feeding  children, and working hard to enhance  their quality of life. And now we pro pose cutting them off at the knees by  taking chunks of their salaries to meet  budget constraints. Even a 2-day fur lough can have devastating effect on a  struggling worker or family.  I  can't  imagine  anything more  unfair to these dedicated people and  potentially damaging  to  the Federal  work force, and, in turn, the productiv ity of this country. At this moment,  Federal employees at the Department  of Defense are working night and day  to sustain our activities in the Persian  Gulf  crisis,  and other Government  workers are engaged in vital activities  all across the country. There are other  ways of solving our budget woes, and  we must find them but an extensive  furlough of essential employees is not  the way. I urge my colleagues to move  decisively  to  reach  a  responsible  budget agreement by October 1.  CONDOLENCES TO  FAMILY OF  U.S. AIR FORCE S. SGT. JOHN  CAMPISI  <Mr. TORRES asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1990
1267,1335,16,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Speaker, let me  say to my colleagues, ever since I was  allowed  the privilege and honor of  serving with you, I never have had to  stand before you for the reason I do  now.  It is with profound regret and sad ness that I must now inform you of  the death of one of our young service men while on duty in the Middle East.  U.S. Air Force S. Sgt. John Campisi, of  West Covina, CA, was hit and killed by  a truck on Sunday, August 12, while  on duty in Saudi Arabia.  As a member of our Armed Forces,  John was one of the first of our per sonnel to arrive in the Middle East.  A career military man, John, at age  31, was married and had four young  children.  His death, one of the first to occur  as a result of this current crisis, was  both grievous and damaging to those  leaves four chil who knew him. He  dren.  My  sympathies and  those of my  fellow members, go out to his family  and loved ones.  Unfortunately, John's death is also a  reminder. A reminder to us in the Con gress of the United States, that an im portant responsibility of our office is  to provide for the welfare of American  personnel overseas.  Let us remember our duty to bring  them home safely, so that their fami lies can be spared an anguish similar  to that of John Campisi's family.  Mr. Speaker,  I send a message  to  those  families who have  loved ones  overseas during this tense and emotive  period.  By saying that a peaceful and nego tiated settlement is the primary goal  of  this Government, we  are  letting  them know  that  the  lives of  their  loved ones,  for  their husbands and  sons, wives and daughters, brothers  and sisters, are just as important to us  as they are to them.  Most of us do, indeed, have families,  and so our sympathy, too, is genuine.  Thus, we  in  the Congress  of  the  United States, must work  together  toward reaching a peaceful agreement.  But in so long, we must move quickly.  Let the times be few and far between  that I or any of my colleagues need  come to the floor and announce the  death of a constituent in the current  crisis.

1268,1335,16,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker, along  with majority and minority Members,  I was privileged to visit Saudi Arabia  over  this  last weekend.  It was  a  moving experience and one that makes  all Americans very proud. We can be  very proud of the way that our mili tary forces have conducted themselves  in both the planning and the execu tion of the Operation Desert Shield.  This is a dangerous and hazardous  mission, as all Americans know. We  are there because we want a peaceful  world. We are there because we want  to see that nobody ever takes advan tage of their neighbor and gobbles up  their country such as Saddam Hussein  had done to Kuwait. We are there be cause we know  that history  teaches  that that kind of aggression is infec tious, and if we do not stop it now we  will have to stop it later at even great er cost. We are there because we can  allow no one to drive up the price of  our  fuel  to such an extent  that  it  would wreck our economy and perhaps  wreck the economy of this planet.  ",1990

1295,1426,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Mississippi.  ,1990
1296,1426,16,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President, this  amendment could just as well be enti tled ""A resolution  to commend  the  President on his  leadership and  to  urge that he continue to do what he  has been doing."" In no way should my  remarks be considered critical of the  intent of the amendment, if that is, in  fact, its purpose. This is a matter that  does come within the  jurisdiction of  the Committee on Foreign Relations  of the Senate. We have been advised  that Senators who are members of  that committee are reviewing the reso lution and may have a desire to com ment on it before the Senate votes on  the amendment.  Let me just say at this point, Mr.  President,  that  I  think  the distin guished Senator from Arizona is cer tainly correct when he points out the  very hard work that is being undertak en by the administration, not only by  the President but by members of his  Cabinet and others, to elicit the sup port of other countries around  the  world in the effort to make this eco nomic embargo work and to make it  very clear to Saddam Hussein that his  effort to intimidate by the use of force  and to gain, through an invasion of a  neighboring country, more control and  more power that would be detrimental  to the rest of the world is simply not  going to work and will not be tolerat ed.  The President and his administra tion ought certainly to be commended  for the wonderful leadership that they  have  shown.  I know Senators have  been impressed with the fact that the  United Nations has moved as it has to  adopt resolutions that have been very  forceful and very strong  to  indicate  not only an economic embargo be im posed against Iraq, but that it be en forced with the use of force, if that is  necessary,  under  certain  circum stances.  I think it is also important to recog nize the unity displayed by our NATO  allies in not only supporting and fully  participating in the economic embargo  that the President has recommended,  but also participating in the deploy ment of military forces to the region  to help convince Saddam Hussein that  he cannot win, that he cannot expect  to achieve any positive result from the  actions that he has undertaken so far.  What I hope the Senate will not do,  however.  adopt  a measure  that  would  in any way suggest  that  the  President is not providing strong and  important  leadership  in working  to  help achieve these goals. I do not say  the working of the amendment does  that but I am not an expert in these  matters and am not a member of the  Committee on Foreign Relations.  It  seems to me, however, that we need  is  not suggest to the President that he  should consult with Members of Con gress about how he is doing what he  has already done. It is  inappropriate  to suggest he is not taking the initia tive, that he is not displaying strong  leadership, when I think the facts are  certainly on  the other side of  that  question.  We do hope that the whole world  understands  that  the United States  Congress  supports  the President  in  this situation and that we are firmly  committed to helping ensure that the  embargo works and that it is enforced;  that the leaders in Iraq and elsewhere  in the region do not make the mistak en assumption that under appropriate  circumstances force will not be used,  because, we  intend  to make  it very  clear  that we will not tolerate the mili tary annexation of  territory or  the  plunder of neighboring countries, ac tions we have seen the President of  Iraq undertake in recent weeks.  It is my hope that the Senate will  have a chance to look at this resolu tion, and, for that reason, Mr. Presi dent,  I  suggest  the  absence  of  a  quorum.  ",1990

1325,1491,16,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this is a noncontrover sial bill that has already passed the  Senate. It is intended to resolve uncer tainties that have arisen over the in terpretation of those portions of the  enabling act under which New Mexico  was admitted to the Union that relate  to the grant of public lands to New  Mexico before and at the time of its  statehood in 1912.  The total territorial and statehood  grants  to New Mexico amounted  to  some  13.4 million  acres.  Presently  there are approximately 9 million sur face acres and 13 million acres of min erals. There have been approximately  4 million acres of surface sold and  some minor adjustments in ownership  of minerals  through  condemnation  action by  the Federal Government.  Annual  income  provided  to  New  Mexico  public  schools,  universities,  and other beneficiary  institutions  is  over $350 million. The surface owner ship in New Mexico is approximately  45 percent private, 12 percent State  trust lands, 10 percent Indian land and  the balance, approximately 33 percent,  Federal. The majority of the Federal  land  is managed by  the Bureau of  Land Management,  the U.S. Forest  Service, and the military departments.  As in other Western States, the land  ownership pattern in New Mexico  is  an extremely complicated one  that  presents many  problems  for  the  United States,  the State, and other  landowners. As in other States, land  exchanges have often been utilized to  rearrange this land ownership pattern  to produce a more manageable divi sion.  Land exchanges involving New Mexi co's grant lands have been carried out  since statehood, but some recent rul ings by courts and a recent opinion by  the attorney general of New Mexico  have cast doubt on the legal ability of  the State, under the enabling act, to  carry out such exchanges.  Earlier  this year,  the New Mexico  Legislature passed a  joint resolution  and memorial asking  that Congress  authorize an amendment to the ena bling act and authorizing a constitu tional amendment to be on the ballot  in the November 1990 general election.  The intent of the New Mexico Legisla ture and S. 2597 are to set forth the  terms that clarify the authority to ex change  lands and  to validate prior  land exchanges.  S.  2597  would  clarify  the New  Mexico  public  lands  commissioner's  authority to exchange any land grant ed and confirmed by the New Mexico  enabling act. This authorization would  include any land of the United States  or an agency thereof, State agency or  political subdivision, beneficiary of the  lands granted or confirmed by this act,  any Indian tribe or pueblo, or private  entity.  This bill would  also  retroactively  apply, so as to remove doubts about  the legality of past exchanges.  Mr. Speaker, this is a noncontrover sial measure, supported by the admin istration, as well as the New Mexico  delegation, including our colleague on  the Interior Committee, ",1990
1326,1491,16,Mr. RICHARD SON., It deals with a technical but real  problem. I urge its passage.  D 1230  ,1990

1328,1491,16,Mr. VENTO.," I yield to the gentle man from California, the chairman of  the Committee on Public Works and  Transportation.  <By unanimous consent Mr. ANDER SON was allowed to speak out of order.)  TAX THE GREEDY, NOT THE NEEDY  ",1990
1329,1491,16,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to express concern about the reports  this past weekend of a proposal to in crease  the gas  tax as part of  the  budget agreement. Mr. Speaker, I be lieve that is the wrong kind of signal  to send to the American taxpayers.  We should not try  to balance  the  budget on  the backs of the middle and low-income Americans.  A gas tax would do just that. It is re gressive and unduly burdens the aver age American wage earner. Perhaps  that  is why House Resolution  41,  which expresses opposition  to  fuels  tax increases, for deficit reduction, has  been cosponsored by 250 of our col leagues.  No  one  wants  sequestration  to  happen, but there has to be a more eq uitable way of addressing the problem.  For example, why can we not elimi nate some of the unfair and distorted  tax preferences enjoyed by corporate  fat cats?  To the budget negotiators, my mes sage is a simple one: if you must tax,  tax the greedy, not the needy.  and  and  asked  revise  ",1990
1330,1491,16,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker, I reserve  the balance of my time.  ",1990
1331,1491,16,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may con sume.  <Mr.  LAGOMARSINO  was given permission  to  extend his remarks.)  Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with  the remarks of the chairman of the  Subcommittee on National Parks and  Public Lands, ",1990
1332,1491,16,Mr. VENTO.,"  As Chairman VENTO  explained, S.  2597  is needed to clarify the State of  New Mexico's authority to exchange  lands granted by the United States in  trust and  to validate prior  land ex changes.  The need for this legislation resulted  from a 1988 legal opinion issued by the  New Mexico  attorney  general  that  questioned  the authority  for  future  land exchanges and cast doubt on the  validity of many prior exchanges. This  cloud over exchanges originated from  the New Mexico Enabling Act of 1910  which placed some significant restric tions of the State's ability to conduct  land exchanges of school trust lands.  As has been mentioned, there is a  sense of urgency in passage of S. 2597.  Because this bill contains an amend ment to the New Mexico Enabling Act  of 1910, the amendment must also be  approved by New Mexico's voters this  November. The New Mexico secretary  of state  requires  that congressional  action must be approved by September  11, 1990 to qualify for being placed on  the November ballot.  As a result, Chairman VENTO should  be commended by everyone involved in  this  issue for his expeditious action  particularly at a time during the ses sion when we are already faced with  an enormous legislative burden.  Finally, I would like to reiterate that  S. 2597 is supported by all five mem bers of the New Mexico congressional  delegation as well as State elected offi cals involved in land exchanges such  as the attorney general and commis sioner of public lands.  I urge my colleagues to support S.  2597.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from  New Mexico [Mr. SKEEN].  ",1990
1333,1491,16,Mr. SKEEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of this legislation.  I want to thank the gentleman from  Minnesota [Mr. VENTO] and the rank ing member, the gentleman from Cali fornia  [Mr. LAGOMARSINO]  for  their  tremendous assistance in bringing this  important  legislation  before  the  House. I also want to acknowledge the  help  of  the  gentleman  from New  Mexico  [Mr.  RICHARDSON]  for  his  strong support of this bill and to our  State  land commissioner, Bill Hum phries,  for  his  leadership  on  this  matter. For  reasons  I will  explain  ",1990
1334,1504,16,Mr. SMITH of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of H.R. 4985, a bill  to  rename  the  Federal Building in Miami the Claude Pepper  Federal Building.  It was with a deep sense of personal  loss  that I, along with U.S. Congress, the State of  Florida,  and  indeed  the  entire  country,  mourned the passing last year of one of this  century's greatest Americans, Claude Pepper.  I knew Claude for 20 years, and it is impossi ble for me to imagine a more caring, dedicat ed, honest and loved man.  Claude Pepper began his 60 years of public  service in 1929, as a member of the Florida  State House. Claude went on  to become a  U.S. Senator from 1936 to 1951 and, finally a  Member of Congress  from  1962 until  his  death. Throughout his illustrious career, Sena tor Pepper served 1 O U.S. Presidents and  championed many noble causes-none as  dear to his heart, however, as the plight of the  elderly. This powerful commitment began not  when he became older, but at the very start of  his career. Sixty years ago, he sponsored a  bill to permit senior citizens to fish without a  license. Claude's deep  compassion  for all  people-seniors, children, and  the disadvan taged-came not from any political ambition  but from a deep and abiding love and heartfelt  concern.  As Senator Pepper grew older, he refused  to slow down. One could find him poring over  legislation, returning a constituent phone call,  fighting  for an  issue on  the House  floor. As  Time said of him in 1982, ""he is like a vintage  automobile with new parts: he keeps getting  better and more powerful with age.""  The  Federal  Building  in Miami  housed  Claude Pepper's district office  for over 20  years. It was here that he worked tirelessly to  improve the lives of both the young and old,  and  it  is here  that we should pay  tribute  to  him by renaming  the Federal Building  in his  honor. By  keeping Claude Pepper's name  fresh  in  the minds of the people of Florida,  the legacy of this wonderful human being and  patriot will grow for generations to come.  ",1990

1340,1504,16,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker,  this  legislation being  brought to the House floor for consid eration today would result in an im portant and appropriate tribute to two  former Members of the House: Speak er Thomas P. <Tip) O'Neill, Jr. and  President Gerald R. Ford.  In addition to naming House of Rep resentatives  office  buildings  after  Thomas P. O'Neill and Gerald R.  Ford, this resolution provides that the  Speaker may purchase or accept as a  gift to the House of Representatives a  suitable  statue or bust of Speaker  O'Neill or President Ford for display  subject to certain conditions.  Thomas P. <Tip) O'Neill, Jr. had a  remarkable career  in  the U.S. Con gress, spanning 34 years. He was born  in Cambridge, MA, on December 9,  ",1990
1341,1530,16,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in support of  H.R. 5558 and am pleased to join the  distinguished chairman of  the Com mittee on Banking, Finance and Urban  Affairs,  the gentleman  from Texas  [Mr. GONZALEZ] as a cosponsor.  The chairman has mentioned  the  three provisions which would extend  until October 31, 1990, and I will not  be repetitive there, but this involves  the Emergency Low Income Preserva tion Act  of  1987,  the  Interagency  Council on the Homeless, and the in crease  in  the FHA  loan  limit. Al though all three items are addressed  in the comprehensive housing authori zation bills  recently passed by  the  House and Senate,  time constraints  made it virtually impossible to enact  final authorization  legislation before  the end of September. Because current  law with regard to all three provisions  is due to expire on September 30, 1990,  it is essential that this bill be passed as  temporary extensions of the three pro grams, until permanent legislation can  be enacted.  The Emergency Low Income Preser vation Act refers to the prepayment  moratorium  in  title  II of  the 1987  Housing Act, which prohibited  the  prepayment of mortgages on privately  owned, Government-assisted housing.  In  1987  Congress  took  temporary  action to prevent a large-scale loss-up  to 360,000 units-of affordable,  low income  housing  units. The House passed  omnibus  housing  bill, H.R.  1180,  contahis  the Barnard-Bartlett  compromise as a permanent solution  to the prepayment issue. The Senate passed bill, S. 566, basically makes the  prepayment moratorium permanent.  This is a contentious issue which will  take  time  to resolve. The point the  prepayment moratorium contained in  the 1987 Housing Act is due to expire  on September 30, 1990, if we do not do  something. We need to pass a tempo rary extender until a permanent solu tion can be agreed upon in conference.  Another section of  this bill deals  with the Interagency Council on the  Homeless. The Interagency Council on  the Homeless was established by the  McKinney Act  in  July  1987. The  Council provides Federal  leadership  and coordination for activities which  assist homeless individuals and fami lies. Although  the Council member ship  is composed of various depart ment and agency heads-chaired by  Secretary Kemp of HUD-the Council  receives a small, annual authorization  for Washington, DC, staff and 10 re gional coordinators. The provision au thorizing the Council is due to expire  on September 30,  1990. Again,  this  temporary extension is necessary until  the McKinney Act is reauthorized.  In last year's appropriations bill, the  FHA  loan  limit was  raised  from  $101,250  to $124,875  for  fiscal year  1990 only. This bill would temporarily  maintain this increase, pending enact ment of an authorization bill to per manently authorize  the higher  loan  limit.  The  administration  supports  this  legislation and I urge all Members to  support the bill.  ",1990
1342,1530,16,Mr.  GONZALEZ.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  before yielding time to the gentleman  from Massachusetts [Mr. FRANK], I do  want to have the record reflect that if  anyone has taken the leadership on  what we call  this prepayment  issue,  those Members who recall the general  debate on the housing reauthorization  bill, it sounds as if it is something that  is almost  impersonal, but it involves  hundreds of  thousands of  low  and  moderate income renters, and the leg islation would not be possible were it  not for the efforts of the gentleman  from Massachusetts [Mr. FRANK]. And  I believe  there have been others on  the committee over on the minority  side; we have had very active partici pation by not only the ranking minori ty leader,  the gentleman from Ohio  [Mr. WYLIE], but the gentleman from  Texas [Mr. BARTLETT].  0 1510  Mr. Speaker, on this point I do think  we ought  to  reflect and give credit  where credit is due to those that have  taken the leadership in this very, very  critical issue, and the gentleman from  Massachusetts  [Mr. FRANK],  I  think,  was the member I would put at the  head of the list.  So, Mr. Speaker, I yield up to 18112  minutes to the gentleman from Massa chusetts [Mr. FRANK].  ",1990
1343,1530,16,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman from Texas [Mr. GON ZALEZ], my chairman, but, unlike the  precedessor committee, I do not think  we will be taking all or our time. But I  want to thank him for his very gra cious words and his leadership, and I  want to acknowledge  the speed with  which he and  the ranking minority  member,  the gentleman  from Ohio  [Mr. WYLIE], acted in allowing us to  have this extension come to the floor.  The point, as has been made clear:  We have a deadline with which we set  ourselves because we were not trying  to delay. We were making a good-faith  effort to meet the deadline. We will  come very close, I believe, but, in case  we do not quite meet it and send the  bill to the President that I hope he is  going to sign and that 10 days may  lapse, we want to make very important  assets,  namely  subsidized  tenancies.  So,  extending  the deadline on  this  moratorium from September 30 to Oc tober 30 is very important.  As  the  chairman,  the  gentleman  from Texas [Mr. GONZALEZ], has point ed out, we have been working very  hard on this bill. We have not yet got  the complete agreement, but I must  say that I think, if my colleagues look  at where we are today, we are closer to  agreement. We will go to a conference  with the other body. There will be not  unanimity, but I believe we are within  clsoe reach of an agreement. I  think  we will come out with something that  will resolve most of the problems.  For many of us it is absolutely essen tial, given the scarcity of affordable  housing in the country today, that we  act so that we do not lose any units,  and that means two things.  First of all, Mr. Speaker, we have to  prevent vulnerable people from being  evicted, people who moved into these  buildings knowing that they were fed erally subsidized, who have lived up to  their  obligations  of  tenancies, who  have paid  their  rent. They have a  right to be protected in their homes.  In addition, Mr. Speaker, we have to  make sure that the  tenancies  them selves remain. These subsidized units  are a very scarce  resource, and we  cannot allow various economic forces  to deprive us of the units we already  have.  It will cost us some money, but, if  my colleagues assume that providing  subsidized housing is one of the rele vant functions of this Government, it  is very clear that protecting the exist ing  subsidized  units  is  by  far  the  cheapest per unit way to maintain a  given number of subsidized units. If we  would have to rebuild these, or build  them anew, it would cost a great deal  more.  So, I look forward to working under  the leadership of the gentleman from  Texas [Mr. GONZALEZ]  in our confer ence. I believe we are going to come  out with a housing bill which will do  this Congress proud. Obviously, be cause of the budget, we are not going  to be able to fund it at the levels many  of us would like to see right now, but  we are, I believe, going to be able to do  the right thing substantively.  Mr. Speaker, getting this passed is  important  so  that we  can  legislate  with some deliberation and know that  whatever we come out with in confer ence does not come after the horse has  been stolen. This locks the barn door,  and we do not always do this in Con gress. This locks the barn door before  there can be any loss of a horse, and  for that I appreciate the leadership of  the gentleman from Texas, and I ap preciate the willingness of the gentle man from Ohio [Mr. WYLIE]  to allow  us to move so rapidly so we could do  that, and I am delighted to give my  chairman a present of at least 16 min utes, which I am sure he can use, and I  hope someday I will be rewarded for  that.  ",1990
1344,1543,16,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  introducing legislation to prevent im competent  and negligent physicians  from treating Medicaid patients. The  need for this legislation has been iden tified during the ongoing investigation  of the Medicaid Program being con ducted  by  the  Subcommittee  on  Human Resources  and  Intergovern mental Relations, which  I have  the  privilege  to chair. We conducted an  initial hearing in my home State of  New York, whose problems are similar  to  those of other States with  large  urban populations.  Our investigation is finding that sub stantial numbers of Medicaid patients  are  subjected  to  highly  dangerous  medical treatment by negligent or in competent physicians. Although I be lieve these physicians represent a very  small percentage of our Nation's doc tors, in a State like New York-where  only 15 percent of the licensed physi cians  treat Medicaid  patients-the  poor care provided by those few doc tors can wreak medical havoc on thou sands of patients.  In large urban areas such as New  York City, we have identified patterns  of poor care involving physicians who  are often educated  in Third World  countries and are certified to practice  by  a  loose State medical  licensing  system. These physicians are hired by  unscrupulous entrepreneurs to work in  shared health  facilities, more  com monly known as Medicaid mills. The  care provided by the worst Medicaid  mills is characterized by a wide range  of  improper practices,  including bla tant drug dealing, overutilization of di agnostic tests, and the failure to pro vide even minimal quality of care.  In New York City,  it is estimated  that there is a shortage of 500 physi cians in innercity neighborhoods with  large Medicaid-eligible populations. Of  the doctors who are available, most do  not provide the full spectrum of care  considered to be basic medical practice  in the United States. The majority of  these physicians lack board certifica tion or hospital affiliations, including  more than half of those who provide  care to pregnant women.  It is astonishing that some of these  physicians are  licensed and allowed  into the Medicaid Program in the first  place. But compounding the problem  is  the  inability or unwillingness of  Federal or State Medicaid authorities  to remove dangerous doctors from the  Medicaid system, even after their mal treatment of Medicaid patients has  been identified.  Financial fraud is treated more seri ously by State Medicaid agencies than  negligent medical care. More resources  are spent on fraud investigations than  quality of care reviews. Typically., phy sicians  excluded  from  the Medicaid  Program or delicensed by State boards  are removed because they committed  fraud. Doctors who practice poor qual ity of care are rarely disciplined with  more than a slap on the wrist.  Our review of all Medicaid physi cians referred to the New York medi cal licensing authority for disciplinary  action in 1987 and 1988 found that the  penalties recommended by the State  department of health had been dis missed or lessened in 40 percent of the  cases. Most of  these cases  involved  fraud. The most egregious quality of  care cases  investigated by the State  were not ref erred for discipline at all.  We also found that, of the few doc tors who are excluded from the Medic aid Program, most continue to practice  medicine and eventually return to the  program after the exclusionary period.  The Federal Government need not  condone the leninent treatment given  to dangerous physicians. We should  close the loopholes that allow incom petent physicians  to  treat Medicaid  patients. Today I am proposing reme dial steps that the Congress can adopt  to prevent truly incompetent and neg ligent physicians from treating Medic aid patients.  The Medicaid  Physician  Service  Quality Improvement Act of 1990 will  help State governments keep tabs on  incompetent doctors by requiring that  Medicaid physicians have unique iden tifying numbers for billing purposes.  Under this provision, the identifying  numbers of the physicians who actual ly treat Medicaid patients must be in cluded in the billing, thus preventing  incompetent  physicians  from  using  large health care  firms  to disguise  their participation in Medicaid.  The bill also requires foreign medi cal school graduates to pass a certifica tion exam already required for partici pating  in  the Medicaid Program  in  order to be eligible for Medicaid reim bursements.  To prevent the problem of unquali fied  doctors  providing  specialized  treatment to patients, the bill would  require that physicians providing pedi atric and obstetrical services either be  certified or hospital-affiliated in these  specialities, or have a consulting ar rangement with a physician who  is  certified or hospital-affiliated.  The  legislation would also  require  State governments to conduct quality  of care reviews of high-volume physi cians or health care plans.  Finally, my proposal would require  all State health care agencies to report  all adverse  findings  involving physi cians in the Medicaid Program to the  Federal Government, even when no  ",1990
1345,1569,16,Mr. BUECHNER.," Mr. Speaker, as much as  we may hear the term ""hero,"" once in a while  an act of true heroism will remind us how rare  a commodity heroism is. It is far more impres sive when the source of such an act is a mere  12 years of age. With this in mind, I rise today  in tribute to my constituent, Robbie Sanders of  Florissant, MO,  the boy-hero  from Mccurdy  Elementary, who recently received the Ameri can Automobile Association  [AAA] School  Safety Patrol Lifesaving Medal Citation.  Robbie Sanders had volunteered to partici pate  in his school's safety patrol, and  the  morning of October 11, 1989, marked only his  third day on duty in this responsible role. He  had just walked out into the street, arms out stretched to stop traffic so that several small er students could cross the street. As the stu dents entered  the crosswalk Robbie noticed  that an oncoming car was not slowing down  as it approached.  Rather  than simply avoiding  the car, and  thus  guaranteeing  his  own  safety, Robbie  quickly decided  to remove  the children  from  the car's path, putting his own life in danger.  He took two children  in his arms and pulled  them back to the curb while pushing the other  two students. They all reached the curb, nar rowly avoiding  the oncoming car.  In  those  brief seconds, Robbie saved the lives of these  small children.  The School Safety Patrol Program is an ex cellent  idea which provides a badly needed  service to the community. It helps in ensuring  the safety of younger children, while teaching  responsibility to the older children. The AAA is  to be congratulated for providing the lifesaving  medal citation and  recognizing students  for  their courage-students like Robbie.  Mr. Speaker, perhaps the most remarkable  thing about this  is  that Robbie, while partici pating in a program designed to teach him re sponsibility, has taught all of us a great deal  about courage and heroism. Accordingly, I ask  my colleagues to join me  in saluting Robbie  Sanders and all of the other recipients of the  AAA School Safety Patrol Lifesaving Medal Ci tation.  23697  COMMENDING THE COCA-COLA  co.

1346,1569,16,Mr. DARDEN.," Mr. Speaker, there is a pho tograph on my office wall of American Gl's  drinking Coca-Cola  in  their  foxhole  during  World War II. This photo is a reminder that we  should never allow our troops to feel that they  are completely isolated from home and  from  the simple pleasures of  life  that we usually  take for granted here. Coca-Cola has played  an  important  role  in providing a small, but  comforting boost in morale for America's serv ice men and women throughout some of the  most difficult crises of the century.  And now, as American troops are digging in  in  the Saudi Arabian desert,  the Coca-Cola  Co., whose home is in Georgia, is again dem onstrating  its good  citizenship by donating  $500,000 to the USO in support of our forces  in the Middle East.  I commend Coca-Cola for  contributing to the welfare of our troops over seas and trying to make their difficult assign ment a little easier to bear. The USC's mis sion is uniquely vital to our defense, and the  corporate support of companies  like Coca Cola is an indication of the unity of support for  those serving our Nation in faraway places.

1347,1569,16,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Speaker, too often we open  our daily newspapers and read horror stories  about  the problems  facing our Nation's chil dren. Divorce, drugs, and teen deaths are just  a  few of  the many obstacles  that we  read  about plaguing the lifeblood of our future.  Today, however,  I am not here to tell an other horror story.  Instead,  I am here to  tell  you about a program that has been started in  my district to help our children fight back. It is  called Good Grief Project.  The Good Grief Project is a joint effort be tween Hospice Care of Broward, Inc., and the  Junior League of Fort Lauderdale,  Inc. These  two groups have worked  to provide support  for  the nearly 30,000 bereaved children and  adolescents  in Broward County, and  to pre vent the development of emotional problems  caused by unresolved grief.  The Good Grief Project provides advanced  training  to professionals who work with be reaved children;  is developing a resource of  materials to be located in a special section of  the main branch of  the Broward County Li brary; and  is  increasing public awareness of  these resources through public speaking pres entations to the community.

1348,3,21,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, I had  prepared remarks that I had intended  to deliver this morning dealing with  this proposed tax increase which is un necessary,  totally  unnecessary, Mr.  President, on the American people, in  my opinion. But it was brought to my  attention before I left my office that I  had  received  a  letter  and  then  a  memorandum attached  to  it from a  Mr. William  B.  Corbett  in  Soda  Springs, ID, where he requested that I  read this to the U.S. Senate.  When I  looked at my remarks that  were prepared that we had worked on  yesterday and looked at his letter, I  thought maybe his letter was more ap propriate. His letter certainly is very  blunt, very direct, and in some ways  some Senators may take it that he lm pusns their motives slightly.  I would only say that, disregarding  those very blunt statements, I  think  there is a message in this letter that is  filled with basic common sense. And,  of course, the comman sense that is in  the letter, is that we do not need a tax  increase. What we need to do is spend  the same amount of money this year  that we spent last year and freeze the  budget and we would have a balanced  budget in a very short period of time  without putting any undue hardship  on any people in the country.  So  I would  just  like  to  read  letter from Mr. Corbett.  this  DEAR SENATOR SYIOIS: The following re marks concerning the present U.S. Budget  fiasco are directed to the entire U.S. Senate.  I would very much appreciate your reading  them before that full body.  Then his letter commences:  DEAR SENATORS: Let me begin by quoting  the  first paragraph  from  the October 6,  1990 Vol 18, No. 39 issue of the Pro Farmer  newsletter  published  by  ""Professional  Farmers of America Inc"".  ""Congress reaches a new low. We have fi nally reached the point where there are so  few statesmen looking after the welfare of  the nation as a whole, and so many back alley politicians who care only about buyfna  enough votes to be re-elected, that Coll81""es&  has lost its ability to govern at all.""  And also, please allow me to paraphrase a  statement made by Abraham Lincoln.  ""You can fool all of the people some of  the  time, and you can fool some of  the  people all of the time, but you cannot fool  all of the people all of the time"".  ,  It appears that fooling all of the people  all of the time is the goal of Congress, and  has been for many many years. There are  220 million plus citizens in this nation, and  perhaps you can fool 20 million of them all  of the time, but the rest are wise to you. I  am writing this memo on behalf of myself  and the several hundred million people who,  I am sure, like myself, are no longer fooled  by your shenanagans.  You make such a big deal out of  this  budget business.  I  suppose  that's to con vince us that you are really trying to do  something worthwhile; but I, and the sever al hundred million citizens that I am speak ing for, know that this budget ""crisis"" can  be solved very simply by freezing the new  budget at the current 1990  level for five  years.

1349,16,21,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Ohio is recognized.  ,1990
1350,16,21,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I rise as one of the seven Senate mem bers of the conference committee on  the Civil Rights Act of 1990.  I want to say publicly that the dis tinguished Senator  from Utah has  done yeoman work  in attempting to  bring about a compromise in connec tion with this legislation. He has put  his heart and his soul into it. He has  made a good faith effort. Those who  are more strongly procivil rights than  some of the opponents of this bill have  also made a good faith effort. But the  fact  is  the President of  the United  States has been resolute in his opposi tion.  Having  commended my  colleague  from Utah for the magnificent effort  that he has put into this bill in trying  to bring about a compromise, I am dis appointed  that now  he  speaks  so  strongly against it. I am disappointed  that he tells his colleagues that they  should vote against this bill because  some little details in the bill are not  satisfactory.  I am disappointed to know, and he  tell us, that David Duke and George  Bush and ORRIN HATCH  are against  this bill. Maybe 60 percent of  the  whites in Louisiana did vote for David  Duke. Maybe  they will not vote for  this bill. But I believe the overwhelm ing majority of Americans would vote  .for this bill. I think passage of this bill  is the Senate's way, the Congress' way,  and, hopefully, the President's way of  saying we do not agree and are not  going to yield to the David Dukes of  America..  This conference report embodies the  will of a strong majority of the Senate.  More  importantly,  the  conference  report restores basic civil rights pro tection for millions of Americans.  Women and minorities were victim ized last year in a series of stunning  Supreme Court decisions. Those deci sions  turned back  the clock on our  progress  toward  equal  opportunity.  This bill rights those terrible wrongs  inflicted by the Supreme Court.  At the outset, I must commend Sen for his  leadership  in  connection with  this  legislation. He  has mastered the legal issues in the  bfil. He has spent hundreds of hours  negotiating with the White House and  educating his colleagues. Senator KENator KBlfflmy  NEDY's performance was  a  tour de  force. It is truly one of the finest legis lative efforts I have witnessed in my  tenure in the Senate.  He has been helped  immeasurably  by  Senator  JEFFORDS, my  ranking  counterpart on the Labor Subcommit tee. He deserves great credit. He has  been steadfast in his commitment to  restoring civil  rights protection  for  women and minorities. Many  in his  own party do not support that effort.  But with no reservation, no  lack of  courage, Senator  JEFFORDS  has put  principle above politics. And the same  I might say holds  true  for Senator  SPECTER who  has worked  tirelessly  seeking to fashion a consensus pack age.  It is a fact that we thought we had  worked out  that package. But  the  White House has been determined to  block a consensus. Those who have  the ear of the President have consist ently insisted upon the very last letter,  the very last comma, every single dot  over every i. So they come here today  threatening a veto.  Mr. President,  I do not  intend  to  review the intricate substantive details  of the conference report. By now the  arguments about such  issues as  the  burden of proof  in disparate  impact  litigation-things that people do not  understand-and the composition of a  pleading  alleging  a  discriminatory  group of practices are all too familiar  to those of us who deal with this type  of legalese. But 240 million Americans  do not understand it.  I will tell you who does understand  this bill: The people who are affected  by  this bill,  those who  have been  fighting for an equal share of opportu nity in this country, those who have  not been getting a fair share of the  action,  those who have suffe-red dis crimination over a period of years in  the history of our Nation. Yes,  they  understand it. They do not understand  the wordage. But they understand the  impact.  The real  issues at stake here are  issues of  integrity,  issues of  justice,  issues of fairness. I want to tell Mem bers of the Senate, in particular my  colleagues from Arkansas and Oklaho ma, that this conference report proves  again that the Senate has a sense of  integrity about it. It vindicates one of  the cardinal rules of the Senate, and  that is a Senator is only as good as his  or her word.  As we all remember last July when  we enacted  the Civil Rights Act of  1990, in the Senate, a number of Sena tors were  precluded  from  offering  amendments to the bill. The minority  leader acting fully within his rights  under postcloture procedure blocked  any efforts to improve the bill.  But the chairman of the Labor Com mittee  and  the  majority  leader  pledged that the conferees would fight  for  two particular amendments. The  first amendment by Senator PRYOR  would have made clear that a mere  statistical imbalance in the work force  is not sufficient to make out a viola tion of title VII. The second amend ment by Senator BOREN and others  would have set a cap on punitive dam ages at the greater of $150,000 or com pensatory damages.  Let me make this clear. I personally  oppose any cap on damages. I believe  that  the  jury or the court has  the  right to determine for itself or them selves what that amount should be. I  particularly resent a cap on damages  assessed against a person who has in tentionally  discriminated  against  women and minorities.  I  think it is fair to say, Mr. Presi dent, the majority of Senate conferees  oppose any imposition of any cap. At  the conference it became clear that a  majority of the House conferees vehe mently opposed any cap, as well.  Let us be  realistic. What occurred  was this: pledges have been made on  the  floor of  the Senate  to Senator  BOREN.  to Senator PRYOR, and  to a  group of other Senators  that  those  amendments would be provided for in  the conference report. And those of us  who were on the conference commit tee, even though we did not agree with  those particular amendments, felt that  we were honor-bound to make good on  those pledges. We  fought hard  for  that cap. We argued, we pleaded, we  cajoled, and, yes, it is fair to say that  we  twisted a few arms until we were  successful. We said to the civil rights  community  leadership, ""We made a  commitment, and you are in no posi tion  to  try to prevail against us,  to  keep us from living up to that commit ment.""  They were not in agreement, but the  good soldiers that they are, they rec ognized  that commitments made by  those who are leading the effort on  their behalf are commitments  that  have to be kept. I can tell you that our  efforts were not popular with many  advocates of  this bill or with our  House counterparts. They were not  popular with us, ourselves. But our  credibility was at stake, and  I  am  pleased to say that we honored the  pledges made to assert the will of the  majority of the Senate.  The pledge made on the floor of the  Senate by the majority leader and by  the chairman of the Labor and Human  Resources Committee was  kept.  I  think any caps on damages are un sound  policy,  but  the  conference  report includes both the Pryor and the  Boren amendments. Senators PRYOR  and BOREN and other Sena.tors who  were concerned about those particular  issues have a right to be comfortable  with this conference report.  We went the extra mile in this con ference report. We agreed to have the  bill recommitted to conference, after it  ",1990

1353,29,21,Mr. KERREY.," Mr. President, I have  listened to the distinguished Republi C&D leader's explanation of the bubble,  and I find it in fact persuasive. The  language about the bubble itself has  often been  inflated and overstated.  Nonetheless, I also heard the distin guished Senator  talking  about  the  1986 tax law and the bipartisan sup port that law had. I will admit I was  on the sidelines during the delibera tions over that tax law.  It is my understanding that one of  the features of that 1986 tax law was  that we were going to create neutrali ty between capital and wages,  that  there was an attempt to try to take  out the incentives for people to go one  way or the other. Now I hear people  coming back and proposing a capital  gains reduction. Am I missing some thing here, or was that also part of the  1986 tax law, and part of the reason  that people liked that particular piece  of legislation?  ",1990
1354,29,21,Mr. DOLE.," Well, I do recall the act,  because I was there, and I was a party  to the conference report. I remember  there was a great deal of discussion,  and I  think  there was a conclusion  that as long as you keep it at 28 per cent, maybe we  should not have a  lower capital gains rate.  At that time, President Bush made  the  judgment-this Senator did not  make that judgment-that one way to  stir the economy and to create jobs and  there was  some  demonstrated  effort of that-would be to lower the  capital gains  rate. That  is why  the  President, I guess, stated it in his cam paign and has made an effort since  that time to have it adopted by the  Congress. It has not happened. Partly,  in the Democratic so-called Ways and  Means package, it limited capital gains  for small farmers. We would have to  change that here to make it apply to  more than the household and others  who own their homes.  ",1990
1355,29,21,Mr. KERREY.," If the Senator will  yield for one additional question. I ap preciate that answer. I have not read  the Ways  and Means Committee's  package. In fact, I have not read the  Finance Committee package. We have  enough difficulty just wading through  that without getting into the details of  the House.  There is a piece of it that has appeal  to me. It has a feel, from the way it  impacts in the State of Nebraska, and  that is-and the question is whether  or not  it has appeal  to  the distin guished Senator from Kansas, as well.  That is, that part that says that we  are going to simply increase that last  marginal rate. I acknowledge that it is  not bursting a bubble. We are general ly increasing that last marginal rate  and levying an attempt to set a sur charge on people who have  income  over a million dollars, for the purpose  of eliminating  the gas  tax.  I know  Kansas must be similar to Nebraska.  We have had tremendous increases al ready in energy costs, and we built all  of our roads in Nebraska with the gas  tax; we always have. We are second or  first highest in the Nation on the gas  tax now.  My concern with the gas tax is that  not only is it going to increase the cost  of doing business, 70 percent of our oil  use is in transportation. We are heavily dependent upon  it  to move  the  products to market. Not only will it do  that, but it seems to me that it does. in  fact,  fall  disproportionately  heavy  upon those who have been paying an  increasing amount, particularly with  payroll taxes, in the 1980's.  So my question  is whether or not  that piece of it has any appeal to the  distinguished Senator from Kansas?  ",1990
1356,29,21,Mr. DOLE.," Obviously, it has appeal.  If you are looking for a painless pack age,  I would  like  to peel out every thing. I would not like to, but I think  you have to pay a penalty around here  for being leaders.  Everybody wants to reduce the defi cit, but nobody wants to contribute to  the reduction. They do not want more  tax; they do not want to cut any pro grams they are involved in, and that  includes  Congress  and  the White  House and includes everybody else.  But my view is that we are over in  the gulf now because of oil. I remem ber seeing a Time magazine poll about  6 weeks  ago,  asking  the American  people how many are willing to make  the sacrifice because of the gulf crisis.  It was 84 percent. We are all over  there because of oil. If we used less oil  and gasoline, we might not be over  there.  The next question was,  ""Are you  willing  to  have  your  gas  tax  in creased?"" Seventy-three percent an swered no. People cannot have it both  ways either. They want to sacrifice, as  long as they do not have to make a  sacrifice. We have to make a sacrifice,  and we have  to provide  leadership.  Some of our constituents will not like  it. I do not like the gas tax. I do not  particularly  like  it when it goes for  deficit  reduction.  If it went  into a  highway  trust fund, we could build  bridges and highways, I would be hap pier with it.  ",1990
1357,29,21,Mr. KERREY.," If the Senator will  yield again,  I  remember earlier  this  year,  the distinguished Senator pro posed doing just that. I publicly sup ported it. I  thought it was a  terrific  proposal.  ",1990
1358,29,21,Mr. DOLE.," If we go back to that, I  would support a gas tax increase for  policy reasons, to help conserve oil, to  make us  less dependent on  foreign  sources of oil and maybe bring some of  the people back from Saudi Arabia.  Second, we have a couple hundred  billion dollars  that we ought  to be  spending on infrastructure. I know the  Senator shares this view, because he is  on  the Appropriations  Committee.  That is where all the money goes into  the trust fund, and we have some way  to get it out so it can be spent for  highways and bridges, if there is a gas  tax.  ",1990
1359,29,21,Mr. KERREY.," If the Senator will  yield further for a question. I quite  agree.  I  think  there comes  a  time  when you have to act, and I supported  ",1990

1361,68,21,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  I am  also pleased to join with Senator KEN NEDY and all of these other Senators  who have worked so hard on this con ference report, the ""National Commu nity Services Act of 1990.""  I want to compliment all of them be cause they have all worked on this bill  to make it a strong bipartisan bill and  one which the White House can accept  and support.  I feel very good about that. America  does have a strong history of people  helping people.  I  salute  that spirit  here today. This legislation represents  and promotes that spirit.  President Bush has recognized the  importance of volunteers to our com munities and the contributions  they  make every day to the. quality of life  we have here in America. The Thou sand Points of Light  is not  just a  cliche. Volunteers make a difference.  We see the good effects of their ef forts every day.  I want to commend President Bush  for his support of this legislation and  for his efforts  to ensure a package  that will allow State leaders a chance  to accept the President's challenge to  invigorate our State and local commu nities to the call of national service.  The  conference  report  before  us  today includes the President's Points  of Light Foundation, which will  in spire  individuals and  institutions  to  engage in community service, identify  successful volunteer  efforts,  reward  and duplicate  their  successful  pro grams elsewhere, and discover, devel op, and encourage new leaders for vol unteer and community service.  Another part of this legislation calls  for more voluntarism at  the State  level. This State grant program repre sents the best structure for these vol unteer programs.  I am pleased that  the House was willing to accept the  Senate structure which will permit  every State in the Union to participate  in a national service program and to  promote voluntarism in its own way.  Flexibility is given to States to choose  a volunteer program  that addresses  their specific needs. The selection in cludes community-based and school based volunteer programs;  a  youth  service and conservation corps; a full or part-time volunteer corps; or the de velopment  of  their own  innovative  programs  that address  their specific  needs.  In Utah,  the  legislature has  passed a bill which sets up a Youth  Conservation Corps. This program for  high-risk youth will help perform the  immense task of maintaining and im proving the vast amount of urban and  rural land in our State while educating  our youth about the value and satis faction of hard work at the same time.  I recognize, however, that every State  may not want this specific approach  and would pref er to develop different  programs. States  should have  that  flexibility.  Mr. President, I want to thank my  colleague, Senator KENNEDY, for all of  his efforts in putting this legislation  together. His commitment to this leg islation  has  been  the  impetus  for  bringing all sides together to develop a  consensus bill  that now enjoys wide  support. It is indeed a tribute to his  brother that this new effort comes 30  years after his call for volunteer spirit  through  the Peace Corps and other  successful  national  volunteer  pro grams like VISTA and Foster Grand parents. These  are  legacies  for  all  Americans. Today's efforts,  I  hope,  will be viewed 30 years from now as a  success and a tribute to the bipartisan  work of President Bush and President  Kennedy, and Senator KENNEDY.  I also appreciate the hard work of  Representatives HAWKINS and GOOD LING and all of the House and Senate  conferees and their staff members. In  particular,  I want  to  thank Shirley  Sagawa, Nick Littlefield, Gene Sofer,  and Kathy Marshall, and, of course,  Nancy Taylor of my staff. This legisla tion has taken a lot of effort, but will  be helpful in providing another outlet  for volunteers across this Nation.  Mr. President,  this  legislation will  not by itself make America a better  place  to  live. The Points of Light  Foundation will not by  itself beam  light around the country. But, we can,  by enacting this bill, take a position in  support of volunteers. And,  that, we  ought to do. A vote for passage of this  bill  sends  a  supportive message  to  American volunteers, you matter, you  are important, and you make a differ ence in the lives of all Americans.  Mr. President, I urge the support of  all of my colleagues for passage of this  conference report.  Mr. President, again, I thank my col leagues, particularly, Senator KENNE DY,  Senator DURENBERGER,  Senator  PELL, Senator DODD, Senator MIKUL SKI, and, of course, Senator DoLE who  played  a  big  role  in  this, Senator  GRAHAM, and others; Senator MITCH ELL as. well; and above all, the White  the  House who put it all together, helped  us put it together, and helped us to  bring this to pass.  I yield the floor, Mr. President.  Ms.  MIKULSKI  addressed  Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER  (Mr.  RoBB). The Senator from Maryland is  recognized.  ",1990
1362,68,21,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Thank you, Mr.  President.  I rise today to urge my fellow Sena tors to support the National and Com munity Service Act of 1990.  I want to thank Senators KENNEDY,  NUNN, PELL, DODD, HATCH, and other  people on the other side of the aisle,  you, Mr. President, for helping formu late this legislation.  Mr. President, we have a very histor ic opportunity. We are about to pass a  legislative framework that really cre ates a continuum of national and com munity service. But most of all, it cul tivates the habits of the heart, from  primary grades all  the way  through  life.  And it instills the most basic value in  our society of neighbor helping neigh bor. The National Community Service  Act brings dreams within reach.  Invest in our young people by invest ing in our communities. It puts full and part-time volunteers  to work  in  their  own  communities,  delivering  meals on wheels, weekend meals on  wheels, helping the illiterate, building  habitats for humanity. It turns away  from Wall Street and the Wall Street  values of excess that left our Nation  on the verge of financial bankruptcy.  It turns back to the values of Main  Street.  When we  talk about the habits of  the heart, it does mean neighbor being  concerned about neighbor.  Senator KENNEDY outlined how this  bill provides this continuum. Let me  focus on my part of the legislation.  Mr. President, in a time when people  question the efficacy of Government  programs,  they have every  right  to  question why a new program. Well,  Mr. President,  this does not create  more government; it creates more op portunity, and it creates more earned  opportunity. It gives our young people  a chance, that through their own work  and own sweat equity, they can earn a  voucher, by doing community service  that they can use to reduce either stu dent debt, or hold as a nest egg toward  home ownership, first-time home own ership.  Mr. President, what  this means  is  that we are not talking about a give away program. We  are not  talking  about  another  program with  big,  bloated bureaucracy. We are talking  about a program run by the States,  under efficient administration by Gov ernors, and by which young people, in  my part of the bill, would off er their  services  to work  two weekends  a    _.

1375,81,21,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, this  is a bill that defines the kind of coun try we want. Senators now have a his toric choice. You can vote  to repair  the fabric of our fundamental civil  rights laws and assure fairness for the  working men and women of this coun try, or you can listen to the far right's  false cry of quotas and tum a deaf ear  to call for  justice for the 53 million  women and men and 21 million black  Americans  and  9 million Hispanic  Americans in the work force. They un derstand the issue;  they live with it  every day: discrimination, prejudice,  harassment. Often  they can obtain  only second-class jobs.  This is a bill that defines the kind of  country we want America to be. If we  tolerate discrimination, we will lessen  our country and America will not be  America. Crying quotas is a last resort  of opponents of civil rights, and that  charge will not stick because it is not  true. This is not a quota bill, it is an  antidiscrimination bill. Congress un derstands the difference, and I hope  the President does,  too. If the President keeps an open mind, he will  reject the advice of his Attorney Gen eral and he will sign this legislation  when it reaches his desk. It is time to  end the double standard that defines  equal opportunity for women and mi norities, no ifs, ands, or buts.  Civil rights is  the unfinished busi ness of America. It is always an uphill  battle, and this is the lesson of all our  history. We  fought battles  like  this  many  times  before,  and will  fight  again and again and again, until we  end discrimination in America and fill  the promise of this country. It is not  over until it is over.  I  believe  there  is  a  good chance  President Bush will sign the bill. If he  vetoes it, there is a good chance the  Congress will override the veto. Con gress  overrode  a  veto  of Ronald  Reagan, and Congress can override a  civil rights veto of George Bush. The  President's instinct on many different  issues  is  to split the difference, and  often that satisfies many people, but  you cannot split the difference on civil  rights. It is wrong to split the differ ence with discrimination. The Presi dent has to do more than pay lip serv ice to civil rights, and the party of Lin coln should be the party of civil rights.  Mr.  President,  I  hope  that  the  Senate will vote favorably in behalf of  this conference report.  ",1990
1376,81,21,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Who  yields time?  The Chair  from Utah.  ,1990
1377,81,21,Mr. HATCH., I yield myself 3 min utes.  ,1990
1378,81,21,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator is recognized for up to 3 min utes.  ,1990
1379,81,21,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, there is  not any question of splitting the dif ference here. It is a question of wheth er we can get  this bill  to not be a  quota bill, a litigation bonanza for law yers, a bill that takes away rights of  certain citizens and gives preferential  rights to others, a bill basically more  interested  in equality of  results  for  groups than it is in equality of rights  for individuals.  That is what this bill is. The defini tion of ""business necessity""  is much  more burdensome  than current  law  even before Wards Cove. This new def inition will permit employers to adopt  only minimum standards in the work place.  The bill still shifts the burden of  persuasion in disparate impact cases to  employers, compelling them to prove  their  own  innocence. That  is  not  American jurisprudence. The bill still  permits  broad-scale  and  across-the board attack on all employer practices.  Plaintiffs do not have to list the spe cific practice or practices that caused  the disparate  impact;  they Just can  allege all of them. In many cases these  allegations will never be narrowed.  the Senator  recognizes  ",1990
1380,107,21,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President,  I  rise today in recognition of one of the  great college choirs of Arkansas and  this Nation. As Philander Smith Col lege,  a  fine  educational  institution  deep in tradition, celebrates its 113th  year in existence, the Philander Smith  College Collegiate Choir celebrates its  centennial. For the benefit of my col leagues and readers of the RECORD,  I  would like to quote material published  by Philander Smith College  for  the  choir's 100-year anniversary celebra tion:  Available college information in the years  1890-91 suggests that a small group of sing ers born to ex-slaves were organized by Miss  Nellie A. James to form the first singing  group on the campus. Miss James, a Meth odist missionary, was one of many who trav eled from the North for the cause of educat ing Negroes in the South.  During the early years, the singers, known  as the ""sextet,"" consisted of a soprano, an  alto,  two tenors and two baritones. These  polished and well-mannered groups often  traveled  for months  across  the country,  singing to Methodist congregations to raise  money for the college. Mrs Jennie B. Bats, a  soloist  in the  traveling choir  in 1917, ex plains, ""       for many years the school de pended heavily on the funds raised by the  singers.    *""  In 1934,  the Philander Smith College  Choir, as it was called, reached its greatest  prominence under  the direction of Miss  Ruth Helen Gillum. Her structured and dis ciplined style of direction led the choir to  national respectability and gained recogni tion for herself as a composer-arranger. Her  published Negro folk arrangements include  ""There's no Hiding Place"" (dedicated to the  Philander  Smith College  Choir),  ""Roll,  Jordan Roll"" and Miss ""Choric Dance."" Mrs.  Thelma T. Woodfolk, a soloist under Miss  Gillum, described her as ""a woman full of  beauty and virtue, { with} great dedication.  *"" During Miss Gillum's  tenure,  the  choir had the distinct honor of appearing  on  the same program with Prima Donna  Marion Anderson and the famous ""Wings  Over Jordan"" on CBS Radio.  From  1934  through  1969,  the  choir  reached a  series of performance plateaus  which have been warmly  referred  to  as  ""The Glory Years."" With the acquisition of  a bus, the choir further increased its popu larity with concerts and appearances on  radio and  television programs  throughout  the state and nation.  For the final 10 years of this successful  35-year period, the choir was under the mas terful baton of Carl G. Harris, Jr. <now  Ph.D.>. Mr. Harris expanded the rich tradi tion of  the choir by skillfully organizing  annual concert tours through cities and fine  academic institutions. He was  the first  to  conduct the college choir accompanied by a  symphony orchestra.      Mr. Harris  is  responsible for giving  the  choir its present designation. His insertion  of the title ""Collegiate"" has given the choir  the sense of class and distinction it holds  today. Ending an era, his choral groups  compiled  numerous  and well-documented  moments in the history of Philander Smith  College. His accomplishments are still large ly unequalled.  Mr. President, this is an outstanding  choir and, under the current leader ship of Director Stephen L. Hayes, it  has maintained  its most noteworthy  tradition. Year after year, Mr. Hayes  has done a tremendous job of molding  young voices into a choir that makes  Arkansas proud.  In celebration of the choir's 100th  anniversary, the Philander Smith Col lege will host a symposium and choral  festival for Arkansas high schools and  colleges, an organ recital by Dr. An thony E. Williams of Fisk University,  and a concert by the Collegiate Choir  at Little Rock Central High School.  The highlight of the year will be a  choral festival featuring some of the  Nation's most outstanding historically  black college and university choirs.  The Philander Smith College Colle giate Choir is certainly worthy of the  recognition of this great body.e  UNITED STATES-VIETNAMESE  RELATIONS   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President,  last  week I addressed the Senate on the  subject of United States-Vietnamese  relations. The purpose of my remarks  was  to express my support  for  im proved  relations with Vietnam, but  only if the pace and scope of those de veloping  relations  were  linked  to  progress on several outstanding hu manitarian questions and on progress  toward real political reforms in Viet nam.  Of the bilateral humanitarian issues  I enumerated  in my statement,  the  most important was the full account ing of Americans missing in action in  Vietnam. As public debate begins  in  earnest on normalized relations with  Vietnam, I want to reemphasize just  how central the resolution of POW I  MIA questions  is  to progress on the  question of normalization.  In short, Mr. President, there can be  no  progress  toward  normalization  unless Vietnam determines  that the  time has arrived to finally and defini tively  conclude  all  the outstanding  POW /MIA cases that it is in its power  to resolve. Better rdations with Viet nam, and with Cambodia and Laos, for  that matter, will not occur  absent  their full cooperation  in  the  fullest  possible  accounting  for  the  nearly  2,300 Americans who remain missing  in Southeast Asia.  I have no doubt, Mr. President, that  if the Government of Vietnam wanted  to resolve this issue, it could do so im mediately. We must convince the Viet",1990
1381,120,21,Mr.  JOHNSTON.," Mr. President,  I  rise to support the passage of S. 2362,  the Insular Areas Recovery Act, with  amendments to the committee amend ments by myself and my  colleague  from  the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources, Senator McCLURE.  This  legislation was  initiated  in  re sponse  to  storm damage  repeatedly  suffered by our island territories,  in cluding the recent devastation caused  by hurricane Hugo  in the Virgin Is lands. Records of the Federal Emer gency Management Agency show that  there have been 39 disasters in the ter ritories in the past 20 years.  These frequent severe storms have  revealed a systemic problem in our na tional response to disasters in the is lands. The  islands  repeatedly suffer  severe damage from violent storms in  large part because they are not rebuilt  to  withstand  future  storms.   The  Nation currently has a policy of re building storm damaged areas to those  conditions which existed prior to the  storm. In areas of high storm frequen cy, such as the Caribbean and the Pa cific, this has resulted in a very costly  cycle of repeated destruction and re construction.  S.  2362 would help  to break  this  cycle by providing the President, and  the Governors of the Insular Areas,  with additional options for financing  hazard mitigation projects  so  as  to  harden  these  areas  against  future  storms. For a complete explanation of  the provisions of S. 2362, I ref er my  colleagues  to Senate Report 101-363  which sets forth the background and  recommendations of  the Committee  on Energy and Natural Resources re garding this legislation.  The committee reported S. 2362 on  July 12, 1990. However,  floor action  was not  initiated, at  the  request of  representatives in the Virgin Islands.  Given the lateness of the session, how ever, further delay in Senate passage  threatens enactment of  the bill and  the availability of funds to the islands.  Of particular concern are the authori zations for three programs contained  in S. 2362 and for which appropria tions  are  expected.  Unfortunately,  these funds cannot be expended with out the enactment of the authorizing  provisions included in S. 2362.  The  proposed  Johnston-McClure  amendments  would  make  several  modifications  to  the  committee  amendments as requested by the ad ministration. These modifications  in clude limiting the scope of the author ization under section 3;  limiting the  expansion of hazard mitigation assist ance under section 6, and providing  that  the  president may  require  a  matching contribution  for  such  ex panded assistance; and striking section  8 regarding loans from the Rural Elec trification Administration.  The Johnston-McClure amendments  to the committee amendments would  also add several Senate passed legisla tive provisions  to S. 2362. These  in clude  the provisions of S. 2841,  the  Omnibus Territories Act,  passed by  the Senate on August 3, 1990; and sec tion 12 of S. 247, authorizing the Ter ritorial Energy Assistance Program,  passed by the Senate on January 25,  further  details  regarding  these measures, I refer my colleagues  to  the appropriate  floor  statements  and committee reports.  Each  of  these  additions was  ap proved unanimously by the Committee  on energy and Natural Resources and  unanimously by the full Senate.

With that  in mind. I would like to quote from the  Wall Street Journal:  World leaders have been wringing their  hands lately over the U.S. fiscal chaos and  soaring oil prices. But the leaders would do  well to pay more attention to the troubled  trade negotiation taking place in Switzer land. Those talks may hold the key to the  future of the global economy.  The stakes are huge. Even a moderately  successful conclusion  to  the  talks, being  held under  the auspices of  the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, would  spark a  $100  billion-a-year expansion  in  world trade, according to Gary Hufbauer of  the Institute for International Economics, a  Washington  think-tank. And  trade  repre sentative Carla Hills says  the U.S. could  enjoy a $200 billion increase in exports to  developing countries over the next decade.  The GATT talks are going to con clude  in  the next  several weeks.

Mr. Speaker,  the  able gentleman  from South Carolina has explained  the provisions of the rule and it would  be redundant for me to repeat those.  Mr. Speaker, I want the Members of  this House to listen to what I have to  say. This is not a fair rule. The Demo crats are trying to muzzle the Republi cans by disallowing them the opportu nity to off er a substitute.  I think it is time that we spoke out  to present a budget alternative that  makes sense.  Reduction in spending without new  taxes, that is the philosophy embodied  in the Republican substitute. The gen tleman from Ohio [Mr. KAs1cH] and  the gentleman  from Michigan  [Mr.  PuRsELLl  labored hard and long with  their task force to produce this substi tute, but the Committee on Rules has  denied the opportunity to debate it on  the floor of the House.  I think there should be a vote up or  down on the Republican substitute.  I have been here 28 years, and very,  very seldom, indeed, have I seen any thing like this before. The Nation is at  the crossroads. We are  facing crisis  and chaos unless something is done.  There is assurance, if the Democrat  proposal  is passed,  that it will clear  the Senate, or that it will be signed by  the President of the United States. If  he vetoes it, then there is no assurance  that the veto will be overridden; quite  the contrary, I  think it will be sus tained.  So here we  are,  just a  few days  before October 19 when this Govern ment of ours will come to a screeching  halt. The Federal employees will be  out of work again, our parks will be  closed, the Interior Department facili ties downtown will be closed, and visi tors will be denied the right to use fa cilities that they should have.  So what do we do here today? The  Democrats being a proposal including  higher taxes to the floor that is abso lutely unacceptable to the Republican  Party.  I  think  that  the Democrats  made a serious mistake when they re fused my amendment in the Commit tee on Rules very early this morning  about 12:30 a.m.  to provide that the  Republican  substitute  be made  in  order.  I urge the Members of this body to  vote down  the previous question,  to  def eat the rule, so that the Committee  on Rules can act again and bring a  rule to the floor allowing the Republi can substitute.

1398,172,21,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Chairman, we  have a responsibility to act. The committee has done a good job in bringing  before us a way in which we can act  and act intelligently.  I feel the greatest mistake this coun try ever made in any one piece of legis lation was  the 1981  tax bill, which  gave great benefits to large corpora tions  and  individuals who  are very  wealthy and got an undue gift from  the Federal Government.  Now,  lest  anybody  accuse me  of  being antirich, at one time when I was  a young lawyer in my firm we repre sented people like Alfred I. Du Pont,  Edward Bok, Charles Doering, among  the most wealthy people in this coun try. I never met one of them that did  not feel  like he should pay his  just  taxes. So do not bash the rich. The  rich are willing to make their proper  contribution. At the present time they  do not do so. This bill will make an  effort in that direction.  Finally, before I close, I want to say  to Members that all the tribulations  we  are having here  today are not  going to solve the fiscal situation of  our country. There is only one way in  which the fiscal situation in our coun try 1can be solved, and that is to elimi nate programs.  We have a lot of programs, and I am  not talking about reducing programs, I  am  talking  about  cutting out pro grams, even good programs. We had  an excellent opportunity  the other  day to cut out the arts and human ities. We also have programs like com munity development funds,  the mass  transit  funds,  and  things  like  that.  These programs are good programs  but are essentially local in nature. The  people  are  in  an  antigovernment  mood. They are antigovernment, and  have an antitax point of view. They do  not want to have big government.  We are not answering. The country  is not giving the answer that it should  to our constituents. The answer that  our constituents want is  less govern ment. They have a  right  to ask for  that. Thomas Jefferson, the founder  of our party, said those who are gov erned best are governed least. That is  something we  ought  to be hearing  today in 1990.  ",1990

1400,172,21,Mr. DELAY.," Mr. Chairman, demagog  long enough and you start believing  your own demagogy. The Democrats  assume  that Americans  are  stupid.  The Democrats say that we are here  because Reaganomics  has destroyed  our economy. Mr. Chairman, Ameri cans are not stupid. They have lived  duri.ng Reaganomics. They remember  that policies like the Democratic pro posal we  have before us  today de stroyed our economy under Carter.  After getting only a small few of his  proposals, President Reagan was  re sponsible for  lowering  interest rates,  arresting  inflation,  and  creating  23  longest  million new  jobs during  the  growth period in our history.  Our deficits are created by spending,  not by too little revenues. Let us reject  demagogy and look at the facts.  Our  revenues have gone up  since  1981 by $500 billion, but our spending  has gone up by over $700 billion. It is  spending that is the problem, not too  few revenues. Revenues have risen by  7.5 percent and spending by 9 percent  over the last 10 years.  Americans  are  not  stupid.  The  Democrats say the rich are not paying  enough. Let us look at the IRS figures.  They do not demagog. They know who  owns what and what they pay.  The top 1 percent of income in this  Nation pay 25 percent of  the  total  income taxes paid in this country. The  top 5 percent of income in this Nation  pay 43 percent. The top 10 percent of  income  in  this country pay over 55  percent of the income taxes collected  in this country.  Indeed,  the biggest  target of  the  Democrat revenge, the 65,000 taxpay ers with over $1 million  in  income,  who represent only 6/lOOths of 1 per cent of all taxpayers, not only paid 11  percent of all the taxes paid, but they  paid 41.3 percent of the total revenue  increase in 1988. This means that the  Democrats and  their allies,  like  the  Kevin Phillipses of the world, are en gaged in the most astonishing and de structive, not to mention irresponsible,  level of distortion on this issue. The  result could be catastrophic for our  economy.  The package before us is based on  demagogy, and not on facts. This is a  very important week for America. We  can choose the failed economics of the  Carter years  that almost destroyed  this country, or we  can  reject  this  package and come back  to  the real  problem, spending. We can take  the  Republican  economics  of  cutting  spending, increasing growth and jobs,  and rejecting raising taxes on middle income America.  Mr. Chairman, this package will de stroy our economy if it becomes law.  Let us vote it down.  ",1990

Mr. Chairman, if I might say to the  gentleman from Texas [Mr. DELAY], it  has been the last 10 years of Republi can policies that have brought us to  the point where we have to confront a  record deficit.

I  also  want  to pay  special  tribute  to  the  chairman of  the Ways  and Means  Committee, the gentleman from  nois  [Mr.  ROSTENKOWSKI],  for  at tempting to do something that would  indeed be much more fair to the vast  majority of the American people.  The alternative Democratic budget  requires  that  those who  benefited  from the Reagan years must help to  pay for the Reagan years. It is that  simple. It eliminates the  tax bubble  for the rich. It imposes a 10-percent  surtax on incomes over $1 million.  D 1740  Who can quarrel with that when the  middle class has been picking up the  tab for the majority of Americans for  so many years?  This package  is much, much more  fair to older Americans. It reduces the  unfair hit on Medicare beneficiaries'  out-of-pocket expenses.  It saves  the  cost-of-living adjustment not only for  Social Security recipients but for Fed eral retirees and railroad retirees, and  it drops a grossly unfair provision con tained in the summit deal that would  impose Medicare  tax on State and  local government workers that already  Illi are paying their share of retirement  coverage.  In addition to that, it is sensitive to  the needs of the unemployed, and it  drops  the 2-week waiting period for  unemployment checks.  In addition, it drops the regressive  gasoline tax. How can anyone quarrel  when the alternative budget will drop  the 9-cent gasoline tax and scales back  the proposed tax on liquor?  I  urge passage of  the alternative  Democratic substitute.  I voted against the budget summit package,  because  it placed an unfair portion of  the  burden of deficit reduction on older Americans  and middle-income Americans.  Mr. Chairman, over the  last 1 O years,  the  period in our history that I refer to as the lost  decade, we saw huge  increases  in defense  spending, enormous  tax breaks  for  the rich,  and enormous cuts  in programs  that benefit  middle-income Americans. During  this period  of voodoo economics our Nation's deficit tri pled. Now we are  asked  to pay  for  this  decade of excess and inequity. Although there  are several items in this package that I don't  like, no better or fairer plan, that deals respon sibly with deficit reduction has been forthcom ing  from my colleagues on  the other side of  the aisle. The deficit is a cancer which threat ens the future of young Americans. Medicare  premiums will not be  increased  in  the  first  year. I am concerned about increases in  the  future but  I believe  that  in  the  future Ameri cans will demand universal health coverage  for all Americans.  I believe health care is the  No. 1 domestic issue and we must address it  comprehensively. I will continue my own fight  to reverse this funding trend, yet the proposal  offered by Chairman ROSTENKOWSKI  is much,  much  fairer than  the $90 billion  in Medicare  cuts that the Republican alternative proposed.  My colleagues claim that there are no cuts  in this package and that is not true. Most of  the committees in this House met painful rec onciliation targets. Yet, the alternative offered  by my colleague from Illinois drops a dramati cally unfair proposal  to  impose Medicare HI  tax on State and  local  retire.es who already  have coverage. The alternative eliminates the  regressive  and  untimely  gasoline  tax  that  could cripple our interstate commerce; it drops  unfair  increases on  tier  II  railroad  retirees.  Contrary  to  earlier  recommendations,  the  package keeps a pledge to our civil servants  for full cost-of-living adjustments for all Feder al annuitants and, still retains a 50-50 lump sum benefit for Federal retirees age 65 or with  30 years of service. The Democratic alterna tive drops the absurd 2-week waiting period  for unemployment checks.  To do  this, our distinguished Ways and  Means Committee chairman simply asks us to  require  that wealthy Americans pay  their fair  share. This package eliminates  the grossly  unfair tax bubble. It increases the Medicare HI  wage cap  from $53,000  to $100,000.  It  re quires the Donald Trumps of this world to pay  a  little more  tax on  their yachts and private  jets. No, Ms. Helmsly,  taxes are not just for  the  little people. Those who benefited  from  the Reagan years must be asked to help pay  for the Reagan years. I urge my colleagues to  support the Rostenkowski amendment.  ",1990

1406,185,21,Mr. LENT.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the Democratic plans.  Mr. Chairman,  the  farce  that we are wit nessing today typifies all that is wrong here on  CAPITOL HILL  America is facing a crisis of grave propor tions. For months, the President sat down with  Democratic and Republican  leaders  in Con gress and  together  they  crafted a budget  package. None of us  liked that program, but  despite my misgivings I voted ""Yes,"" not only  to resolve our budget deficit problem but also  to restore in some small measure the respect  of the American people, which had been lost  during the budget debate.  A majority of my colleagues voted to def eat  that package. Since  then, members of both  parties have worked  to prepare budget alter natives. The Democrat plan  relies more on  taxing the middle class than cutting spending.  The bipartisan alternative developed by  the  Senate and endorsed by President Bush tack les the tough problem of spending cuts with out  resorting  to overburdening  the already  overtaxed middle class.  But guess what? None of us will be able to  choose between  the  two budget plans. No  Member here will be able to indicate whether  he  favors increased taxes or cuts in Federal  spending. And why will we not be able  to  stand  up  and  be  counted? Because  the  Democratic Rules Committee has dictated our  choice: We must choose the Democratic tax  package or nothing at all. We will not have the  opportunity  to support  the bipartisan Senate  proposal because, here  in  the House,  the  Democrats have a majority and  the Republi cans do not. It is as simple as that.  Public opinion polls show that the American  people are  fed up with  ""business as usual""  here in Congress. They are fed up with new  taxes and deals struck behind closed doors;  they object to a process that shuts out choice;  they are tired of the same old tax and spend  policies that got us into this mess in the first  place.  President Bush attempted  to draw us  to gether  to pass a deficit  reduction package.  When that effort failed, the leadership in Con gress sought to divide us along partisan lines  by eliminating any element of choice from our  decision.  Instead of discussing and debating  the relative merits of our two differing propos als, we Republicans find c 'Jrselves shut out of  the process, with no altE-., native but  to vote  this package down.  And that is exactly what we should do. Vote  ""No"".  ",1990

1410,354,21,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Chairman, for the  first time in many years this Congress  is being asked to do something mean ingful about our Nation's budget defi cit and national debt. Along with the  President, we have resolved to make a  $500 billion  reduction  in  the deficit  over 5 years. This measure before us  tonight will accomplish that purpose.  In the midst of all of the controversy  surrounding  these  budget  delibera tions, this bill is a clear declaration of  our firm intention to make meaningful  reductions in spending as well as raise  necessary revenue in order to achieve  our goal.  As one of its goals, this bill intends  that the burden of deficit reduction  will be borne in a fair and equitable  manner among taxpayers. In order to  accomplish  that  goal  and  also  to  ensure  the progressivity of  the  tax  system, the plan contains a number of  provisions aimed at allocating a larger  share of deficit reduction to this Na tion's wealthiest taxpayers. These in clude measures  to burst the bubble,  raise the individual minimum tax from  21  to 25 percent, and to impose a 10percent surtax on individuals with tax able  incomes  over  $1 million. By  adopting  these measures, we are en suring  those  taxpayers most able  to  contribute in our effort to reduce the  Federal budget deficit will do so.  It also should be noted that this bill  does not include any increase in gaso line or petroleum taxes-even on home  heating oil. This bill does not impose  any limitation on itemized deductions.  It does not extend the Medicare hospi tal insurance tax to additional State  and local government workers.  Most important of all,  the bill re duces the Medicare Program by only  $43 billion, instead of the $60 billion  cut originally proposed in the budget  summit agreement. This measure will  protect Medicare  beneficiaries  by  keeping monthly premiums  low and  limiting the increase in the deductible.  At most, the reduction in payments to  providers will  reduce  the  rate  of  growth in a program which is growing  faster than any other portion of our  Federal budget. It is not inappropriate  for us to consider measures to control  these costs.  It is also important to point out that  this measure continues to offer special  assistance for rural hospitals. Over the  5 years of this budget plan, Medicare  will finally eliminate the unfair differ ential which causes rural hospitals to  be paid less for the same services than  urban  hospitals. We  cannot  assure  every rural hospital that this budget  will assure its survival, but this budget  gives them real hope for the future.  Mr. Speaker,  I am convinced  that  the only way we can make a real dent  in the budget deficit is  to take bold  steps. It won't be easy, and it will re quire us all to make some tough deci sions, but this Nation faces no more  important problem than reducing the  deficit. This situation scares the ad ministration. It scares  the Congress.  But we must do something  to deal  with it.

This problem  can be effectively addressed only by a  comprehensive program of  reducing  supply and demand, including the edu cation of our youth.  We must educate our youth, prepare  them  to  resist  the  temptations  of  drugs by warning them of the physi cal, psychological and social dangers  of drug use and that drugs are not rec reational-Drugs are deadly. For those  students who know only a life includ ing drug use, we must teach them that  there  is  a better way.

1452,432,21,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from Wisconsin [Mr. KLECZKA]  is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1990
1453,432,21,Mr. KLECZKA.," Mr. Speaker, when Congress  enacted the Financial Institutions Reform, Re covery and Enforcement Act  [FIRREA]  last  year, a principal purpose was to crack down  on  the highflying activities of savings and  loans chartered by Federal  regulators, and,  most  especially,  those  chartered  by  the  States.  That law placed prudent restrictions on the  ability of State chartered savings and  loans  which use Federal deposit insurance. The leg islation  limited  the amount of  loans  to one  borrower a thrift could make, limited direct in vestment in real estate and  junk bonds, and  set a reasonable standard for mortgage lend ing. In addition, it required the Federal Home  Loan Bank system, of which nearly all  thrifts  are members, to pay its fair share of the costs  of the FSLIC bailout.  Now, aided by some clever  legal advisors  and State  legislatures eager  to  take advan tage of Federal deposit insurance  for thrifts,  minus  the restrictions of FIRREA,  those es sential reforms could be scuttled.  To get out  from under  the  coverage of  FIRREA, some State chartered savings and  loans are simply converting  to an organiza tional  form known as a State savings bank.  This  relieves  them  from supervision by  the  regulator charged by Congress as the princi pal enforcer of FIRREA mandates for savings  and  loans,  the Office of Thrift Supervision,  and  raises  the possibility, depending on  the  prescriptions of the state legislatures involved,  of an exemption from certain FIRREA restric tions.  If a loophole  in FIRREA which allows  the  creation of State savings bank  [SSB]  is al lowed to stand, we may be setting ourselves  up for a repeat of the FSLIC disaster.  What could be the practical effect of a con version  from a State chartered savings and  loan to a state savings bank?  First, conversion  to a State savings bank  would remove them from the FIRREA ""loans  to one borrower""  limitation. This very  impor tant provision, which  requires  thrifts  to have  the same standard as national banks,  is es sential. Otherwise, State law could prevail for  State savings banks, which could mean that a  thrift could have most or all of its lending tied  up with one borrower, a very dangerous situa -tion.  Second, a State savings bank conversion  would allow institutions to  leave  the Federal  Home Loan Bank system, an option which  almost certainly would be exercised by certain  well capitalized thrifts. The problem with this is  that FIRREA required the Federal Home Loan  Banks, which are capitalized by the  thrift in dustry,  to pay  their share of  the bailout.  If  thrifts are allowed to leave at will, they will be  shirking  their contribution  to  that  fair share  payment. If the Federal Home Loan Banks do  not contribute  to  the bailout costs  the $300  million per year mandated by FIRREA,  those  costs will be shifted to the taxpayer.  Third, State savings banks would not have  to meet  the  ""Qualified Thrift Lender""  test.  This very modest provision of FIRREA  re quires  thrifts to have 70 percent of portfolio  assets invested in residential mortgage loans  and related qualifying  investments. Over and  over  during  consideration  of FIRREA, we  heard  that  the  thrift  industry needed assist ance due to the vital role it plays in mortgage  finance. The quid pro quo  involved  is  that if  there is Federal assistance, that mortgage fi nance effort must be maintained at reasona ble levels. This is not an unduly burdensome  requirement. For the quarter ending June 30,  1990,  the composite breakdown  for  the 47  State chartered Wisconsin savings and loans  shows  that approximately 73.8  percent of  assets were mortgage-related-66.3 percent  were mortgage loans and contracts, and 7.5  percent were mortgage-backed securities.  Fourth, FIRREA  limits Federal and State  savings and  loans  to  invest only up  to 400  percent of capital in loans secured by nonresi dential real property. Shifting to a State sav ings bank would lift this limitation.  In at least  one State, for example, State savings banks  are not now subject to any limitations on such  commercial loans. That can be expected to be  repeated.  Fifth, conversion of mutual  thrifts to stock.  OTS  regulations severely  limit  the ability of  mutual managers to purchase stock when a  thrift converts from a mutual  form of owner ship  to a stock  form. Converting  to a State  savings bank removes  this  restriction, which  opens the possibility to windfalls for well-situ ated managers.  Finally, conversion to a State savings bank  raises  the possibility  that  thrifts may exempt  themselves from FIRREA restrictions regard ing  the purchase of  junk bonds, a prospect  which  I know troubles greatly our colleagues  from North Dakota, BYRON DORGAN, The prin cipal author of the FIRREA junk bond provi sions.  I want to stress that not all of these circum stances would occur  in every State  if  this  loophole goes unplugged. Some States might  include restrictions in their laws. Others, how ever, might not. All States, however, would be  rolling the dice with Federal deposit insurance,  and the taxpayer could be asked, once again,  to pick up the tab for mistakes made at the  State level.  A handful of States have allowed for State  savings banks for some time.  Illinois,  Indiana  and Louisiana have enacted legislation since  the passage of FIRREA which allows their es tablishment. The Wall Street Journal reported  today that at least seven other States, includ ing California, Texas and Florida, are consid ering such  legislation. The Commissioner of  Savings and Loan  in Wisconsin  recently an nounced that he will propose such  legislation  next year.  Mr. Speaker, now is not the time for such  conversions. While there is indeed a need for  an overhaul of the regulatory framework, not  only for thrifts, but for banks and credit unions  as well, Congress cannot allow an evasion of  prudent safety and soundness rules  included  in FIRREA. Toward that end,  I will be joining  my Banking Committee colleague, Republican  BRUCE VENTO of Minnesota, in drafting legis 1ation  to plug  this  loophole before Congress  adjourns.  At  this point,  I would  like  to  insert  in  the  RECORD  the Wall Street Journal article  from  today which describes the situation.  [From the Wall Street Journal Oct. 16,  1990]  STATE LEGISLATURES MAY BE CREATING  LOOPHOLE FOR S&LS  (By Paul Duke Jr.)  WASHINGTON.-State  legislatures may be  opening a huge loophole that allows savings  and loans to evade the regulations placed on  them last year, federal regulators said.

This summer, we will  recall,  there  was an earthquake which took place in  the Luzon Province of the Philippines.  Worst hit was  a  resort  community  called Baguio. In late August traveling  with Senator LUGAR in the Philippines,  I  had  the opportunity  to  fly  over  Baguio and look at the damage that  hit that area, and it was devastating.  This was a very hilly area. It points to  the fact  that this kind of research,  with a degree of success, could play a  role  in  responding  to  the crisis not  only here in the United States, but in  other parts of the world.  We, of course, know  the horrible  earthquake which  took place  in the  northern part of Iran and the Soviet  Armenian earthquake, and most  re cently this earthquake that took place  in the Philippines. Thousands of lives  were lost in that Baguio area.  I saw these homes which crumbled  down  these hillsides,  and obviously  construction was not to any standard  at all at that time, but this kind of re search that the gentleman's commit tee is pursuing could play a major role  in addressing the problem internation ally, and I thank my friend.  ",1990
1455,445,21,Mr. CAMPBELL of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for  his point. I would note that this was  7.1 on the Richter Scale, but of excep tionally short duration. Had the Loma  Prieta earthquake been of the dura tion  normally  associated with  an  earthquake of that Richter Scale, we  would have had many more tests of  the proposition that structure deter mines damage. We were extremely for tunate. The next quake that will hit is  more likely to be along the fault struc ture immediately east of  the Bay. I  only look at that with great fear and  at other Cypress overstructures and  other instances where we perhaps are  not learning as quickly as we should.  There  is  another aspect which  is  very  important  in  the damage area,  less-so in the question of saving lives,  but that is are we adequately set up  with our Federal Government institu tions to deal with damage to historic  buildings.  Mr. Speaker, I regret to say my con clusion is we are not. Whereas I have  overall positive  things  to say about  FEMA and certainly nothing but posi tive things about the dedication of the  volunteers who work for FEMA and  gave so much of themselves, I am trou bled in a number of respects.  First of all, FEMA's attitude toward  historic buildings has been that the  restoration can be done so that it is a  serviceable building, but not necessari ly to the level that it is again restored  to the historic structure that it was as  well.  I am also troubled at the delay we  have encountered from FEMA. In my  own district, the Watsonville Hospital  is still awaiting determination whether  the damage to it will be compensated  by FEMA, and in my own district of  Scotts Valley,  a dispute  ranged  for  over 6 months between the Depart ment of Transportation and FEMA as  to who was  responsible  for damage  done to a bridge on a State highway.  Incidentally, at that point let me ap plaud the excellent work of Secretary  Sam Skinner who was on the very first  plane out to the bay area with Vice  President QUAYLE, and in a personal  meeting with me subsequently under took the responsibility of reconstruct ing the btidge in Scotts Valley.  In  moving  to  another  Federal  agency,  the Small Business Adminis tration, again my highest  regard  to  Susan Engeleiter,  the Administrator,  but let me observe some difficulties  with which she had to work.  D 2400  Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that the  limits on SBA loan insurance for an  individual are $100,000 for homes lost  by an individual? For a building of a  commercial nature, $500,000.  Mr. Speaker,  it perhaps does not  compel  as much  compassion  as  it  should when I make the remark that  $100,000 does not go very far in buying  a home in California. Sometimes that  statement  is greeted with  the com ment, ""Well, that is too bad. You are  too expensive out there."" But if you  bear in mind that people who, say, put  their life savings into a home and then  with our rapid appreciation in value  might seen an investment of $30,000  become $100,000 in the space of a year  or two, and. that is actual history in  terms  of  the property values,  you  would suddenly find your ability to re build the home you had far, far con strained by  reason of  the $100,000  limit.

At a special dinner on November 12,  the  Hochbergs will be honored as the second re cipients of the Yigal Allon Award of the Ameri can Friends of the Open University of Israel,  Inc.  For  several  years,  the Hochbergs  have  served on  the executive committee of  the  Open University of  Israel,  Inc.,  and  have  worked  to offer  thousands of  students  in  Israel with the highest standards of academic  studies. Its home study method allows capa ble  and  talented  students  throughout  the  count~ to pursue a higher education  in  the  home environment. This home-based program  allows  capable  and  talented  students  to  choose from 250 courses in a variety of sub jects.  In addition to their commitment and dedica tion  to higher education  in  Israel,  the Hoch bergs  have been  involved  in many other  worthy causes. Irwin is a member of the board  of directors of the United  Israel Appeal and  the board of governors of the Jewish Agency.  Rita is a member of the boards of the Joint  Distribution Committee and the New York As sociation  for New Americans  and  is past  president of Women's American ORT.

KANJORSKI  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 1990  ",1990
1457,588,21,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker, 100 years  ago hard-working Polish  immigrants came  to  Shamokin, PA,  to work in the coal mines. At  that time, mine safety measures were virtually  nonexistent. As a result, there often were seri ous accidents or, in some cases, fatalities.  In those times, there was no such thing as  insurance or workman's compensation. An in jured miner had to depend on his family and  friends to help him and his family.  With this in mind, a group of caring and far thinking people banded  together and  pro posed the formation of a society to help the  injured and  their  families weather  the hardEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ships they might encounter after a death or an  accident.  With the blessing of the local pastor, Rev.  Florian Klonowski,  these seven men: Joseph  Majewski,  Phillip  Dyzert,  Frank  Kolowicz,  Joseph Narwicz, Frank Glazik, Walter Stell mach, and John Kolowicz,  joined together to  form  the St. Francis Beneficial Society on  February 2, 1890.  Under their charter, the members of the so ciety would  ""unite  in  the bond of brotherly  love  to promote charitable purposes so  they  may exist in brotherhood, harmony and unity.""  These goals are  truly admirable and  the  good that they do is to be commended. Even  today,  the St. Francis Benevolent Society re mains one of the oldest and  largest Polish American organizations in Shamokin and the  surrounding area.  Mr. Speaker,  they are  the neighbors we  would all  like  to have and we could  learn  much from their excellent example. I know my  colleagues join me in wishing the society best  wishes and good luck for another 100 years.  WELCOME TO AMERICAN  CONSULTING ENGINEERS  HON. JOHN D. DINGELL  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 1990  ",1990
1458,588,21,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I want to inform  my colleagues  that Dearborn, Ml, welcomes  with pride the fall conference of the American  Consulting Engineers Council  [ACEC]. The  council, a federation of 51 State and regional  councils, is a national professional association  representing over 5,000 private-practice con sulting firms which employ 160,000 engineers,  scientists, technicians, and others who annu ally design over $100 billion  in constructed  public works and private industry facilities.  The members of ACEC have been  instru mental in designing infrastructure and cleaning  up asbestos and hazardous wastes  in all of  our districts. Roads,  bridges,  tunnels,  and  other water  treatment  facilities are all de signed by consulting engineers.  Despite  the  fact  that America's consulting  engineers design virtually every  facet of the  United States constructed environment, over  35 percent of the Nation's population believes  that engineers drive  trains, manage  boiler  rooms, or simply do not know the importance  of the engineer to  the American way of life.  This is why I am bringing their important work  to the attention of my colleagues.  Imagine waking  up  in  the morning  and  reaching for a glass of cold sludge. Engineers  design the systems that bring pure water into  our homes. They also build the systems that  enable us  to control  the  temperature of our  homes and offices, clean up hazardous waste  sites, and construct buildings  that will with stand the forces of storms and earthquakes.  We  rely on consulting engineers  for our  quality of life. They have their work cut out for  them in restoring our transportation infrastruc ture. Nearly one-half of all bridges  in  the  United States do not meet minimum safety  standards. By  the year 2000, approximately  7.5 billion gallons of gasoline will be wasted  October 16, 1990  due to traffic congestion alone. The last major  airport constructed in this country was opened  15 years ago,  in spite of the fact that there  has been a dramatic increase in airline traffic  since deregulation 12 years ago. The need to  improve our infrastructure is outlined in numer ous studies which show that increased spend ing on infrastructure translates directly into in creased productivity. Consulting engineers will  do the design work to make the necessary im provements.  Consulting engineers also make a valuable  contribution toward lowering our trade deficit.  The overseas design and construction  indus try accounts for $24.5 billion  in development  projects. Studies show that if U.S. engineering  firms design a project overseas, generally the  construction  and machinery  also  originate  from  this country. The design  industry has  been able to maintain  its share of the world  market, in spite of growing competition.  Mr.  Speaker,  these  impressive  achieve ments have been accomplished by an industry  in which four out of five are small businesses.  We can be proud that the small business spirit  is so strong  in our country.  I  join my col leagues in the Michigan delegation in welcom ing these fine individuals to our State.  MRS.  ANNA  GREENBERG  RECEIVES  GREAT  AMERICAN  TRADITIONS AWARD  HON. C. THOMAS McMILLEN  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 1990  ",1990
1459,588,21,Mr. MCMILLEN of Maryland.," Mr. Speaker,  on Wednesday, October 18,  the B'nai B'rith  Foundation will present  its Great American  Traditions Award to Mrs. Anna Greenberg of  Annapolis.  Mrs. Greenberg will receive the award as a  result of her years of service to her communi ty, not only  in Annapolis, but wherever she  has lived throughout the world. Recipients of  the award are a part of a select group of  American citizens, who, through their dedica tion to their community serve as role models  to young people.  Through her dedication  to both education  and  the arts  in Annapolis, Mrs. Greenberg's  dedication  to voluntarism has made her the  first women  from Maryland  to  receive  the  award. A native of Annapolis, Mrs. Greenberg  has made many important contributions to her  hometown through her work for the Annapolis  Fine Arts Committee, the Annapolis Sympho ny Orchestra, St. John's College,  the Anne  Arundel General Hospital, the resource coun cil, and the junior league, in addition to being  a  teaching guide  in historic Annapolis. Mrs.  Greenberg's dedication to Annapolis and  the  State of Maryland earned her statewide ap preciation when she was named to the Gover nor's Council on Voluntarism.  Mrs. Greenberg is an asset to the Annapolis  community, and her dedication to voluntarism  is an example to us all.  I congratulate Mrs.  Greenberg on  this occasion, and hope  that  many young Americans will follow in her foot steps as dedicated, active citizens.  ",1990

I would simply make the point that  it  is  outrageous  that  the  arrogant  Democratic leadership  in this House  refused to make in order a Republican  budget that cuts spending when they  have waived  the  rule 62  times,  for  spending  increases  and when  they  brought to the floor yesterday a 260page amendment which nobody read.  And it is outrageous that they will not  make our budget in order.  The SPEAKER pto  tempore. The  time of the gentleman from  Illinois  [Mr. FAWELL] is expired.  IN RESPONSE TO MR.

1468,601,21,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, the gen tleman from Georgia [Mr. GINGRICH]  fails  to acknowledge  that, when his  own President presented a plan on this  floor, he opposed  it. The gentleman  from Georgia fails to recognize that,  when his own President set the stand ard for this Chamber in budget deficit  reduction, his side of the aisle failed to  meet that standard.  Mr. Speaker,  the President of  the  United States set the high hurdles for  us  to  clear. The Democrats  have  cleared the hurdles. The Republicans  are trying to run under them. It does  not work.  I say to the Republicans, ""You have  no credibility criticizing our plan until  you can meet your own President's  guidelines and, failing to do that, all  you can do is carp and criticize on the  sidelines.""

1471,601,21,Mr. GINGRICH.," Let me say, first of  all, I love the spectacle of the left-wing  Democrats defending  the President's  position  despite  the  fact  that  the  President said publicly yesterday that  he would veto their budget. He was  not for the budget they brought up  yesterday because  it raises  taxes on  the working American middle class by  $654 according to the gentleman from  New Jersey [Mr. SAXTON]. The Demo crats raised taxes.  Let me say  furthermore  that our  budget was as close to the President's  mark on cutting  spending as  their  budget was to the President's mark if  they take out the taxes he says he  would veto, and I  think it is outra geous that they refuse to make it in  order, that they gag the Republican  Party, and they gag the people of this  country, and I am just surprised they  are too timid to allow a straight up or  down vote on spending cuts versus tax  increases.

1473,601,21,Mr. MILLER  of California.," Mr.  Speaker, Members of the House, obvi ously the Republican Party is deeply  hurt  this morning by  the press ac counts across the country and the re action  to people across  the country  that they failed yesterday in their at tempt  to have a budget considered.  They failed because their budget did  not meet the test. The test was $500  billion  in  deficit  reduction.  They  failed. They failed because they could  not meet their own President's test.  Mr. Speaker, that was widely report ed last night on the nightly news. It  was widely reported in today's newspa pers. They, as a par.ty, are stung.  Why are  they stung? Because this  President has got to make a decision  on Friday: Is he going to shut down  the Government, imperil people's jobs,  health, and safety, to protect the rich?  Because that is  the only alternative  they have now, my colleagues. Either  they can let the Government run, as it  normally would, or they can choose to  throw people out of their jobs, imperil  their safety, imperil their health for  the sake of making one last fight for  the rich of this country who have not  paid  their  fair share over  the past  decade.  Mr. Speaker,  I would be yelling a  little loud if I were the gentleman, too.  It  is  interesting he wants  to  fight  about the budget today, as opposed to  yesterday when  they could have of fered one.  WHO WAS THAT UNMASKED  MAN?  (Mr. FRANK asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1990
1474,601,21,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  address a security problem we appar ently have in this House.  I heard the Republican leader yes terday speak strongly against any tax  increases, and  that causes me some  concern about  the  security of  this  House because 10 days ago a person  purporting  to  be  the  Republican  leader  stood  here  and  urged  this  House to pass a tax increase. He said it  was urgent that we do that.  Mr. Speaker, when someone, and I  was not here at the time, but I read it  in the RECORD; when a man can pass  hiinself off on this House 10 days ago  as  the Republican  leader and  insist  that we pass taxes, only to be contra dicted by a man I know to be the gen tleman from Illinois [Mr. MICHEL] yes terday, who said no taxes should be  passed, the time has come to deal with  smoking-I mean about security.  Mr. Speaker, my friend from Illinois  was worried about smoking. Let us  worry about whoever it was who 10  days ago came in here purporting to  be  the Republican  leader and said,  ""Pass  this bill with gasoline  taxes,  ",1990
1475,614,21,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may require.  Mr. Speaker, for more than 30 years  I have supported and worked on civil  rights legislation, and today the Mem bers of the House and Senate, after a  free and open conference, following re committal of the conference report by  this body on October 11,  have  re turned a Civil Rights Act of 1990 that  reflects a consensus between the bills  that were passed by the two Houses.  This consensus report contains seven  important changes. These changes are  in addition to the amendments in the  original report that bring all employ ers under the protective cap on puni tive damages and clarify congressional  coverage. These modifications and the  refinements that have been made in  the language of the bill since it was  first  introduced help  to significantly  clarify this momentous legislation.  Mr. Speaker, the bill now contains  language that makes it explicit that a  complaining party must prove which  specific employment practice or prac tices  resulted  in  the discrimination  complained of. This  is a  significant  concession that assures that employers will not be required to Justify the  business necessity  for every one of  their employment practices-a process  that would surely be too onerous.  A further aid to the employer in de f ending a charge of disparate impact is  the new listing of specific types of evi dence that may be offered to prove  that an employment practice  is ""re quired by business necessity"" -such  evidence could include ""testimony of  individuals with  knowledge  of  the  practice."" This  amendment  greatly  simplifies the employer's response to  discrimination complaints.  Other refinements were made to the  bill:  A new provision clarifies that this  bill does not overrule existing case law  involving comparable worth.  The bill now makes clear that dam ages  are  not  available  in  ""mixed  motive"" employment decisions, that is,  actions that are based on both nondis criminatory and discriminatory  fac tors.  Provision  is made  for  additional  challenges to consent decrees.  And, finally, the court has more dis cretion  to determine how attorney's  fees  should be assessed  in a  third  party's unsuccessful  challenge  to  a  court order or consent decree.  The major goals of this civil rights  legislation-overturning the Supreme  Court's restrictive 1989 decisions and  providing a damage remedy under title  VII for victims of intentional discrimi nation-are all preserved.  Mr. Speaker, throughout the process  under  which  this  legislation  was  shaped,  the proponents have made  every effort to meet the concerns of  business people and  the administra tion about the effect and application  of this bill. Over and over again, con cessions have been made, language has  been changed, and clarifications have  been added. Last week, we even took  the extraordinary step of recommit ting the bill back to conference. We  have gone the extra mile, and we have  met every  legitimate concern of the  administration.  Unfortunately, these good faith ef forts at compromise and conciliation  have been met with nothing but politi cal sloganeering and counterproposals  that actually would make  the  law  worse  than  it  is now. And, despite  these efforts,  the President  is  still  threatening to veto this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, there is no need what soever for the President to take this  step. There is no need for this Presi dent, who professes to share the bipar tisan commitment  to civil  rights,  to  become only the third President since  the Civil War to veto a civil rights bill.  There is still time for the President  to do the right thing. However, if he  chooses to exercise his constitutional  power of the veto, and if that veto is  upheld, it should be remembered that  ",1990

As was mentioned earlier, it is diffi cult and I guess  impossible to speak  about some of the things that are in  the budget for intelligence authoriza tions.

1478,666,21,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Chairman, I ap preciate my  colleagues'  indulgence.  FMLA, another rebel movement for merly backed by our CIA members,  have accepted amnesty proposals. Mr.  Chairman, many now occupy high po sitions in government and industry in  Angola.  Mr. Chairman.  let Members now  look at the U.S. role. Sadly, this ad ministration, unfortunately, has not  t:eized the initiative to build upon an  enhanced opportunity  for  peace  in  Angola. Instead, it has escalated arms  shipments to UNIT A and has actively  encouraged the leadership to scuttle  peace plans offered last year by the  Angolan Government with  the sup port of 18 African leaders and the Or ganization of African Unity.  Mr. Chairman, the Soviet Union's as sistance to Angola has been reduced.  The Sovfats have publicly agreed to  end arms shipments to Angola if the  United States would  stop  funding  UNIT A. Angola has agreed that if the  United States ended aid to UNITA and  the Soviet Union cut off arms supplies,  that it, Angola, would not go  to any  other  source  for  arms. Only  the  United States has not taken the neces sary step that would complete this cir cular movement, Mr. Chairman, and  end the arms shipments to both par ties.  The gentleman from California [Mr.  DYMALLY] in a very dramatic and com passionai;e way said, ""I am not placing  blame. Let's stop the arms, stop the  killing, and save the children."" I under score his remarks for the purpose of  emphasis. Mr. Chairman, while the An golan Government  is  attempting  to  renew peace talks with UNITA, an op portunity for peace in Angola is more  possible than at any time in the past.  The United States, UNIT A's principal  backer, has not encouraged them to  Join multinational negotiations. The  United States ignores the fact that the  Organization of African Unity opposes  UNITA and United States aid to them.  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, let me  point out and go back and recount  what has taken place in human terms.  The country has the highest amputee  rate in the world. More of the ampu tees, most of  them are women and  children, and more than 50,000 chil dren are war orphans, and more than  800,000 civilians face starvation result ing from the combined effect of war  and drought. Property damage from  the war is estimated at more than $20  billion. Every 4 minutes an Angolan  child dies. Constantly, the beleaguered  land has the world's highest  infant  mortality rate. Mr. Chairman, compas sion and wisdom cries out  for  the  United States to open up this process.  I believe we ought to end it.  We, as a great and mighty nation,  ought  to be  trying  to move  these  people to the table, not trying to spur  more death and destruction.  D 1610  The cold war is over. A new era is in  front of us and let us march forward  finally.  Wearing my hat as chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus,  let me  assert this. I do not of ten assert race  on the floor casually. Whenever I rise,  I do it seriously because I believe it.  We would not tolerate this  in other  countries, thousands of people dying,  children,  amputees,  orphans. We  would rise up in righteous indignation,  but here blacks are dying.  If peace is good on the other side of  the cold war in Eastern Europe, and I  believe that, and I want to support it  and do, then it is good for Africa and  good for Third World countries as well.  Mr. Chairman and members of the  committee, I ask my distinguished col leagues, all of you, to take this out of  the context of the East-West struggle  and see it in human terms, see the dev astation that is taking place and join  me in adopting this amendment and  ending this madness.  ",1990
1479,666,21,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I guess the assump tion that one should draw from the re marks of the distinguished gentleman  fro::.n California is that because these  are black children, somehow they are  unimportant, but I reject that notion  altogether.  It  is  the black children  that I am worried about, too; but I am  worried about Soviet land mines that  are left behind.  I am worried about  the Communists who are pouring in  $500 million this year, as agai:.,st $800  million last year.  You say the cold war is over. There  is a hot war going on in Angola right  now and one-third of the people are  represented by UNITA, Mr. Savimbi,  and they are dying, too.  So yes, let us stop the killing. You  can  always  stop killing. Surrender,  give up,  turn  it over  to  the Soviet  Union. They are still there. Their per sonnel are there. They are in the front  lines. They have launched an offensive  within the last 2 months and they are  getting ready to do another one.  Yes, stop the killing, but stop the  killing on their side.  Freedom, democracy, human digni ty, human rights, that is what the gen tleman has directed his career toward.  That  is what we want,  to support  UNITA in Angola.  The gentleman  took  the  floor  in  1976, I have his remarks here, and he  made predictions that if we would stop  helping the UNITA, the Communists  would leave. The only reason that the  Communists are in there is because we  were helping one of these factions.  Well, the gentleman prevailed. The  Clark amendment, the Tunney amend ment passed and for 10 years we did  not send a quarter over there. Did the  Soviets leave? They are there today,  15 years later, directing the military  operations of the Communist MPLA.  As for pictures of children with their  legs off, we can show you films of chil dren starving in the UNIT A sections  of the country because the Commu nists will not tell Zambia, they will not  tell Namibia that it is all right to send  United Nations food in there.  Starving kids look just as bad as chil dren with their limbs off.  Now, covert action, covert activities  are somehow unsuitable for a democ racy. Well, we have had covert action  since the days of Nathan Hale, and let  me quote from one of the icons of the  Democratic  liberal  pantheon, Mr.  Clark Clifford, who  testified before  our committee on February 24, 1988.  He was saying how terrible, how un worthy it is for a democracy to engage  in covert activity.  Reminds me of the time Queen Vic toria opposed submarines. It was an  un-British way to fight under water.  Well, I asked Mr. Clifford this ques tion:  I  Let me ask you, I take it when you were in  the Truman Administration, you opposed  the covert activity that helped save Italy in  the post-war years from being taken over by  the communists who were pouring millions  of dollars in there? Your distaste for covert  activity,  take  it, was expressed  in  the  Truman Administration?  ",1990
1480,666,21,Mr. CLIFFORD., No. I heart.ny supported it.  ,1990
1481,666,21,Mr. HYDE., That is one covert activity you  supported?  ,1990
1482,666,21,Mr. CLIFFORD., I sure did. And it was very  successful.  ,1990
1483,666,21,Mr. HYDE.," Then you support the success ful ones, but not the unsucce::;sful ones?  ",1990
1484,666,21,Mr. CLIFFORD.," No. That is not the point.  Here was a  carefully structured plan  to  meet the communist menace in Italy. They  were making an all-out plan to get a com munist  government  in  Italy.  Careful,  lengthy  study  indicated  to us  that  the  proper,  intelligent use of  funds  in  Italy  might prevent that from occurring.  So we did it. We did  it successfully.  would do  it  today. That is a very useful  covert activity.  ",1990
1485,666,21,Mr. HYDE., That is my point. You are not  against all covert activity?  ,1990
1486,666,21,Mr. CLIFFORD.," Oh, my, no.  I  So I cite him as an example of some body who can teach us a lesson on a  very successful salvation of Italy from  being taken over by the Communists  after World War II by use of covert ac tivity.  Now, the amendment that the gen tleman is offering is a drastic amend ment. It absolutely renounces, regard less of what the future might hold,  the  possibility  of  a United States  covert action to support the freedom  fighters in Angola.  Now,  the  gentleman  rejects  that  characterization of UNIT A as freedom  fighters. All UNITA wants is free and  fair elections and a cease-fire. That is  all they want.  ",1990
1487,679,21,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Chairman, $60 mil lion in reported military assistance to  UNITA represents not only an unadul terated waste of taxpayer funds, but  also a step which will continue mind lessly adding  to Angola's staggering  human misery. We have heard of the  indiscriminate use of land mines that  has created the world's largest ampu tee population, estimated  to be up wards of 50,000. The war has left over  ~00,000 dead, over 1 million refugees  and displaced persons. In the next 2  months famine will threaten 1.9 mil lion people.  If there  is no durable  ceasefire soon and no effective remov al of land mines, Mr. Chairman, two  thirds of those at risk of starvation  will likely not be reached. That is over  1 million people. If fighting continues  at current levels, fueled by continued  U.S. military  flows, American  relief  agencies such as Catholic Relief Serv ices and World Vision will fail to reach  thousands in need.  Mr. Chairman, I know that the con cern of those that continue to support  this effort is that somehow we will un dermine  those perceived  to be advo cates of human rights and democracy  in Angola. The government of Angola  has an atrocious record on these mat ters, and American policy ought to be  centered on the development of a gen uine multiparty system with free elec tions  and  respect  to  fundamental  human rights.  However, Mr. Chairman, let us be  equally  clear  that  the notion  that  Jonas Savimbi is the apostle and advo cate of these values is simply belied by  his own historical  record. This  is a  man  that  initially  traveled  to  the  Soviet Union for support in the days  when it was a different kind of Soviet  Union. He  then  turned  to China,  became an avowed Maoist, and subse quently turned to South Africa.  D 1750  The only thing that has been con sistent about this individual over all  these years has been the direct corre lation between his  ideology of  the  moment and his source of financial  support.  Mr. Savimbi tells us today that he  espouses democracy, and  I hope he  does. I genuinely do. But those who  may not be conversant with the histo ry of Angola need to know that this is  a man who historically espoused a one party state and saw himself at  the  helm of that state. During private con versations with me in my office, he ac knowledged  under  questioning  that  indeed he was a socialist, more com fortable with  the Chinese  than  the  Soviet model.  Amnesty  International,  Africa  Watch, and Savinbi's formerly sympa thetic  biographer,  Fred Bridgland,  have all documented repeated human  rights  violations: Witch  burnings,  forced labor, and disappearances and  violent mistreatment  of  prominent  UNITA personalities.  Just 2 weeks ago, yet another dis turbing  account  appeared  in  the  Washington  Post, written  by  the  award winning journalist, Leon Dash,  which added further corroboration to  charges of human rights abuses.  Life in UNITA-held areas has hardly  evolved  into a democrctic model of  broad participation. Power  is  tightly  held  in  the hands of President Sa vimbi; UNIT A's internal structure  is  designed along classic Marxist-Leninist  lines; there is no history of free elec tions, free debate or pluralistic toler ance of opposing parties. Rather, soci ety in Jamba has been described as a  monopolistic personality cult, most re centy in an article by Radek Sikorski  in the conservative National Review.  I don't raise this criticism to make  the Angolan Government look better;  that Government's record can also be  roundly criticized.  I emphasize these  concerns because  it  is UNITA with  which we have a close intimate rela tionship. It is UNITA which receives  U.S. dollars, supposedly in the pursuit  of democracy. Let's stop kidding our selves: U.S. covert aid to UNITA is not  about democracy and human rights.  The question is,  is that the proper  use of American  tax dollars at this  time of fiscal constraint?  Mr. Speaker, contrary to administra tion claims, United States policy has  not brought  the warring parties  in  Angola to the edge of peace and de mocracy. There  have  been  seve:ral  face-to-face, exploratory meetings be tween  the . Government and UNITA,  but these do not amount to a substan tive political breakthrough. For that  to happen, we have to work far more  actively with  the Soviet Union  to  apply  even-handed  pressures  upon  both sides to reach a negotiated settle ment.  Thus far this year, four rounds of  Portuguese-mediated exploratory talks  have failed  to dislodge  the Angolan  Government and UNITA  from  their  mutual deadlock. That is because each  side remains mired  in profound dis trust and bitterness and each contin ues to rely overwhelmingly upon mili tary might, in the vain hope that by  bludgeoning  the other side  through  one more round of fighting, it can im prove its military position before com promising politically. Tragically, con tinued external military flows-United  States, Soviet, South African-only  feed this terrible dynamic.  Mr. Chairman, some dramatic step is  required to push UNIT A and the An golan Government out of their dead lock. The amendment offered by Con gressmen  DELLUMS,  DYMALLY,  and  HAMILTON will do just that. I urge all  of my colleagues in the House to join  me in voting in support of it. It is an  action truly in the interests of all An golans; it is an action in defense of the  interests of the American taxpayer.  ",1990
1488,679,21,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1990
1489,679,21,Mr. WOLPE., I would be pleased to  yield to the gentleman from Illinois.  ,1990
1490,679,21,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman, the gen tleman and I have a different view of  Jonas Savimbi. The gentleman is un willing to concede that he had his ride  to Damascus and has been converted.  I too have talked to the man and I  am convinced of his sincerity. That is  neither here nor there.  All Savimbi and UNITA wants, and  they have been fighting very success fully with darn  little  support com pared to what the Soviets have poured  into the MPLA, $800 million last year,  to our-well, it is still secret. If nobody  else will, I will maintain the secrecy of  the amount. But they want a date for  a cease-fire, a cease-fire that is inter nationally monitored, a date  for an  election that is  internationally moni tored, a change in the constitution so  that it can be multiparty, not limited  to one. For 15 years they have been  waiting for that.  The gentleman from Michigan [Mr.  WOLPE] has influence with the Gov err.ment. Why do you not urge it on  them? As  long  as  the Communists  have all the weapons, even the ones  the Cubans are  leaving behind, and  they have enough to last 15 years, I  am informed, and as long as UNIT A is  starving to death, do you think it is an  encouragement to negotiating democ racy with the Communists if we cut  off aid to UNITA?  Do you really think that?  ",1990
1491,679,21,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Chairman, if I may  reclaim my time to respond to the gen tleman from Illinois  [Mr. HYDE],  let  me say, first of all, the objectives the  gentleman has just described in terms  of the kind of constitutional system  that will permit multiparty democracy  ",1990
1492,692,21,Mr. YATES.," Mr. Chairman, I have a  parliamentary inquiry.  The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman  will state it.  ",1990
1493,692,21,Mr. YATES.," Mr. Chairman, will the  Chair repeat what the time limitations  are?  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair would  answer the parliamentary inquiry of  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  [Mr.  YATES] by saying that the gentleman  offering the amendment has 20 min utes, a Member opposed to the amend ment has 20 minutes and, in the event  of an amendment to the amendment,  as expected by  the gentleman from  Washington [Mr. MILLER],  it will be  permitted 10 minutes  total  time, 5  minutes on each side.  ",1990
1494,692,21,Mr. YATES.," Mr. Chairman, is that  true as well on the amendment of the  gentlewoman  from California  [Mrs.  BOXER]?  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair under stands the inquiry of the gentleman  from  Illinois  [Mr. YATES] now  is  to  relate to the amendment of the gentle woman from California [Mrs. BOXER].  If offered, the gentlewoman's amend ment would be permitted to be debat ed for 60 minutes, 30 minutes on each  side.  The gentleman from New York [Mr.  SOLARZ] is recognized for 20 minutes.  ",1990
1495,692,21,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman, I would  like to control the opposition time.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will  permit  the gentleman  from  Illinois  [Mr. HYDE] to control 20 minutes. The  gentleman from illinois will be recog nized  for 20 minutes  following  the  yielding of time or the use of time by  the gentleman from New York [Mr.  SOLARZ].  ",1990
1496,692,21,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, we  have  just gone  through an interesting and illuminat ing debate on the amendment of the  gentleman from California [Mr. DEL LUMS] which has revealed the exist ence of  significant divisions  in  the  House over how best to advance fun damental  American  interests  and  ideals  in Angola. On the one hand,  there are those Members who clearly  believe that the provisions of Ameri can assistance to UNIT A is both inap propriate and even counterproductive.  On the other, there are those Mem bers who believe with equal conviction  that the continuation of American as sistance to UNIT A is essential if we  are going to bring about a negotiated  settlement of  the  conflict  in  that  country consistent with  the aspira tions of the Angolan people for genu ine peace and democracy.  Mr. Chairman, my amendment is de signed  to create a consensus  in the  Congress  to facilitate an end to the  fighting and the holding of free and  fair multiparty elections through a ne gotiated political settlement, and  is  based  on  the notion  that we  are  always most effective abroad when we  are united at home.  D 1900  The amendment which I have of fered has been cosponsored by  the  gentleman  from  Michigan  [Mr.  WOLPE],  the  gentleman  from New  Mexico [Mr. RICHARDSON], and myself  on our side of the aisle, and by the  gentleman  from  New  York  [Mr.  GREEN], the gentleman from Washing ton  [Mr. MORRISON],  the gentleman  from New York [Mr. HOUGHTON], and  the gentleman from New York.  [Mr.  GILMAN] on the other side of the aisle.  It is, I believe, an amendment which  most Members should be able to sup port, regardless of the position they  took on the Dellums amendment.  Let me explain what  this amend ment  is all about. The amendment  wocld permit a continuation of any  lethal aid we may be providing  to  UNITA,  unless  and until President  Bush reports to the Congress that the  MPLA has put forward a proposal for  the  holding,  within  a  reasonable  period of time, of multiparliamentary  elections  in which UNIT A would be  able  to  participate,  and  that  the  MPLA is also prepared in principle to  accept a cease-fire.  In  the event  the President makes  such a  report  to  the Congress, any  lethal aid we are providing to UNITA,  not the relief aid, but lethal assistance  only, would be suspended for a period  of 3 months. At the end of 3 months,  if the :r-A:PLA has reneged on its com mitment to free and fair elections, if  the Cuban forces are not continuing to  withdraw  from Angola,  and  if  the  MPLA is still receiving arms from the  Soviet Union,  or  from  any  other  source, the prohibition on lethal aid to  UNIT A would be lifted and the lethal  assistance could not be provided.  Consequently, under  the  terms of  this amendment, if the MPLA is un willing to commit itself to a reasonable  timetable for free and fair elections  and a cease-fire, lethal aid can go for ward. Mr. Savimbi will not have lost a  cent, and there will be no prohibition  on P..merican  assistance, even  for 3  months. But if the MPLA does make  that commitment, if the MPLA does  agree to a cease-fire and a reaso::1able  timetable for free and fair elections,  which is exactly what Mr. Savimbi and  Secretary of State Baker say is essen tial in order to get a negotiated settle ment of  the conflict,  then  the aid  could not be provided.  Now, what is wrong with this amend ment?  Someone  objected  on  the  grounds that if the MPLA makes a  commitment to free and fair elections  and a cease-fire and we prohibit lethal  assistance to Mr. Savimbi, the MPLA  might  launch a major offensive  to  wipe UNITA out in the interim.  Not  to worry, because the amend ment provides that if there is a major  offensive during the 3-month period  when lethal aid is prohibited-if it is  ",1990
1497,705,21,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself 10 seconds to say to the gentle man that I find it amazing that it is in flexible and dangerous to give the In telligence Committees more power.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to  the senior member of the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence, the  gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. KAs TENMEIERJ.  ",1990
1498,705,21,Mr. KASTENMEIER.," Mr. Chair man,  I  thank  the gentlewoman  for  yielding me this time.  I  rise  in  support  of  the Boxer  amendment.  I cannot say  that it  is  technically  legal  or parliamentarily  perfect or not, nor can I say that the  chances of it ultimately becoming law  are more than very slight. However, it  does one thing. It does get to the heart  of the matter. Even more so than the  3 hours that we spent on Angola, be cause it is a question, the principle in volved here. The question of policy is  so profound, so significant, that really  all other questions we have debated  today pale in comparison.  It has  to do with  the  relevancy,  really, of  the Committee on  Intelli gence, raised by the gentleman from  Illinois [Mr. HYDE] earlier. How rele vant is our committee? It has to do  with whether or not Congress  can  make any meaningful contribution in  terms of national security or interna39-069 0-91-23 (Pt. 21)  tional security questions. What is our  limitation?  Now, I say this, knowing that since I  have been on the Committee on Intel ligence and the Committee on Intelli gence has been operating in a number  of years under what I consider superb  chairmanship,  including  the  gentle man from Massachusetts, Mr. Boland,  the  gentleman  from  Indiana  [Mr.  HAMILTON], the gentleman from Ohio  [Mr. STOKES], and now my colleague,  the gentleman from California  [Mr.  BEILENSON]. That is not the problem.  The problem is our constitutional limi tation, our total inability to do any thing more than to listen up in room   H-405. When proposals are made by  the executive branch, you  listen  to  them. We cannot speak of them. We  cannot  effectively  challenge  them.  There is no vote, normally, on those  propositions, and  there  is no  third party interest.  D 2050  Except in the most rare  instances,  we hear from the intelligence agencies  only  and  the  executive branch on  these proposals.  There are ways, it has been pointed  out,  that could be  challenged. We  could,  and  it was once done by  a  former Member, Mr. Boland,  chal lenge Central American policy; very  painful, very difficult, once in recent  years.  We can with this particular vehicle,  the authorization bill which contains  money, although we  customarily as  you know do not, we can challenge cer tain policies. Today we have in two or  three particulars, mostly by Members  not now members of the Intelligence  Committee.  Iran-Contra, cited by the gentlewom an from San Francisco, is very much  in point. We have seen Judge Walsh  give up the prosecution this last week.  We have seen little come of it because  the  juxtaposition  of  the  executive  branch and the Congress is at a terri ble disadvantage to the Congress. We  literally have been unable, we cannot  even get a suitable notice provision out  of Iran-Contra. The gentleman from  New York [Mr. McHuGH] has worked  desperately hard for 3 years, frustrat ed at every point, to get a notice provi sion. You would  think we  could at  least get that out of the scandal of the  executive branch in terms of a nation al security question, and we cannot.  So I say a vote for the gentlewom an's amendment is a vote for a new  look at how Congress and the execu tive branch can handle intelligence in  the 1990's.  ",1990
1499,705,21,Mr. BEILENSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume. I rise in opposition to the gen tlewoman's amendment.  Mr. Chairman,  I  understand  the  desire of my colleagues,  the gentle woman from California [Mrs. BOXER]  and  those who support her amend ment to ensure the congressional over sight of  intelligence activities  is  as  strong  as  possible. That  is  a  goal  which the members of the Intelligence  Committee share. In fact, it was the  primary  reason  for  the creation of  these committees 13 years ago.  Congress currently has in place ef fective tools for conducting oversight  of the operation of our intelligence ac tivities. These tools Which are applica ble to covert action programs, as well  as  to all other intelligence activities,  include regular monitoring by the in telligence Committee of the conduct  of ongoing programs and the exercise  by our committee and the Committee  on Appropriations of the power of the  purse.  One of  the  results of  the  Intelli gence Committee's use over the past  few years of the authority it has over  funding decisions has been a signifi cant  reduction  in  the  amount  of  money available to initiate covert ac tions, which  I believe has had  the  effect of ensuring a much more judi cious approach  in decisions by  the  President as  to when to apply  that  particular foreign policy tool.  Obviously,  improvements could be  made  in  the congressional oversight  system, and our committees regularly  engage in working with the adminis tration and with the Senate to develop  changes on which both branches of  Congress can agree.  As I mentioned in my opening re marks on the bill itself some several  hours ago, I expect that this year that  process  will  produce  some  badly  needed improvements both in quantity  and quality of the information given  to Congress when it is notified of the  initiation of a covert action. Those im provements include requirements that  findings be  in writing,  that they be  contemporaneous with the decision to  initiate a covert action, and that they  clearly specify  if the involvement of  non-U.S. Government  third  parties  and agencies other than  the  intelli gence agencies is contemplated. These  changes will not satisfy everyone, es pecially those who have reservations  about the wisdom of covert action pro grams under any circumstances, but  they  are  precisely  the  procedural  changes  recommended by  the  Iran Contra committees. That is what they  recommended. They did not  recom mend  the provisions  in  the amend ment of the gentlewoman from Cali fornia [Mrs. BOXER].  The provisions  they  recommended  are in the Senate bill and will, I hope  and trust, be approved by the confer ence  committee  between  our  two  Houses in the near future, and I be lieve  that  they  represent  the most  that  can be achieved, certainly  this  year.

1507,744,21,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, I  rise  this morning to introduce the budget  reconciliation bill for fiscal year 1991.  I do so with both confidence and hope,  I say to my distinguished friend, Sena tor DoMENicr;  confidence  that  the  committees of this body have jointly  crafted a budget plan that is balanced,  one that is fair, and one that does the  critical work of reducing this Nation's  deficit. I offer this package with the  hope that what has been a long wait  for the American people and a period  of uncertainty and strife for this body  will finally be nearing an end.  In my judgment, Mr. President, the  job before us could not be more plain.  Deficit reduction simply must be ac complished, but we must also do it in a  fair and equitable way. We must move  decisively now to accomplish deficit re duction.  I think it is only fair to note in that  context  that  the closed-door budget  summit, in which I participated, took  some 6 months to reach conclusion on  the issues that we address today. And  I must say, Mr. President, I sincerely  hope that is  the last budget summit  negotiation in which I shall ever have  to participate. It was hard, bone-crush ing work, long, long hours.  The product had much  to  recom mend  it  in the final conclusion but  also the product had some severe flaws  to which I think we will all agree. But  the_ task  that we  undertook  for  6  months  in  the budget  summit has  been picked up and completed by the  congressional committees in both the  House  of Representatives  and  the  Senate in the space of only 10 days.  The foundation and the framework  that was done in the budget summit  has been put to good use by the com mittees in both Houses, and I  think  the committees in both Houses of Con gress are to be congratulated for the  expeditious manner  in which  they  have addressed themselves to the task  of honest and meaningful deficit re duction.  This package, which was produced  through established procedures of the  Congress, has a far better chance of  passage than the agreement that was  passed behind  closed doors by  the  small and somewhat  isolated group  that called itself the summit confer ees. Virtually every Member of  the  Senate has had a hand in the creation  of this package, and every Member of  the Senate has a stake in seeing that  this package becomes law.  If we act swiftly. if we act now and  complete our work, we will send the  clearest possible answer to those citi zens who may be troubled that Con gress cannot do its job and cannot do  it on time. I think we will have drawn  and completed in the space of 2 weeks  the largest deficit reduction package  ",1990
1508,757,21,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  time allocated to the Senator has ex pired.  Under the previous order the Sena tor from Montana is now recognized.  ,1990
1509,757,21,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President,  late  last Friday night, about 12:30  in the  morning, the Senate Finance Commit tee reported out its Finance Commit tee reconciliation package. Included in  that package  is  a  provision which  changes the minimum allocation pro vision in the highway formula from 85  to 95 percent.  Such a provision is not within the  jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.  Also, it has no consequence. in reduc ing budget deficit; it has no revenue  effect. In short, it is completely extra neous to the reconciliation bill.  Consequently, late Friday night, Mr.  President, I as a member of the Fi nance Committee, expressed  this as  one of my reasons for opposing the Fi nance Committee bill; I feel strongly  this matter should be taken up, if at  all, next year  in  the next Congress  when reauthorization of the Federal Aid Highway Program comes before  the Senate Environment and Public  Works Committee.  On Monday of this week, I also ex pressed here on the Senate floor, my  opposition to the formula change.  Mr. President, earlier this morning,  at about 9:30  this morning,  I  came  over to the floor to also rise to speak  for the purpose of making a point of  order against  the  reconciliation bill;  the minimum allocation change is ex traneous to the budget bill and, there fore, should fall under the Byrd rule. I  was  told by the leadership that the  leadership would pref er no  amend ments to be brought up before noon  today and no points of order made  before noon  today. Consequently,  I  left the floor so I could come back at a  later time and make my point of order.  Mr. President, I will make the point  of order at a later time today. There  are two ways to remove this heinous  provision from the reconciliation bill.  One would be a motion to strike. That  takes 51 votes, takes a majority of the  Members of the Senate to prevail. The  other alternative to make a point of  order is that the provision is extrane ous under the Byrd rule. That is the  action I will  take a short time from  now. And  if  the Presiding Officer  agrees and rules that the matter is ex traneous and  falls under  the Byrd  rule, it then falls from the bill unless  someone  then moves  to appeal  the  ruling of the Chair. Such a motion re quires 60 votes.  This will be an opportunity for Sen ators  to determine what  road  they  wish to go down. Do Senators on this  reconciliation bill wish to go down the  road of adding in matters that are ex traneous to budget deficit reduction,  or do Senators wish to go down the  road of respecting the  integrity and  authority of the authorizing commit tees?  I hope that Senators on this point of  order, and particularly on a motion to  waive, if such a motion is made, agree  that we, on this budget reconciliation  bill, will not consider an extraneous  matter.  If we go down the road, either by al lowing this minimum allocation provi sion  to remain  in the bill, or allow  other provisions to be in this bill that  are brought up on  the  floor here  today, I strongly submit that we will  be doing a disservice to the Senate, to  the country, we will become entangled  and we will have a budget reconcilia tion bill which will  include matters  that have nothing to do with budget  deficit reduction. Frankly, I think this  would do a disservice to the American  people.  ",1990
1510,757,21,Mr. REID., Will the Senator yield for  a question?  ,1990
1511,757,21,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I have  very little time remaining, but I will  yield to the Senator.  ",1990
1512,757,21,Mr. REID., I  just want to ask the  Senator a question.  ,1990
1513,757,21,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," If the  Senator will withhold, the Chair ad vises the Senator from Montana that  under  the unanimous  consent  pro pounded by the Senator from Tennes see,  there were no  time  limits  for  other Senators to speak.  ",1990
1514,757,21,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, under  the  unanimous-consent  agreement,  might  I  yield  to  the Senator from  Nevada for  the purpose of asking a  question?  ",1990
1515,757,21,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator can yield for that purpose.  ,1990
1516,757,21,Mr. REID.," I say to the Senator, it is  true that he laid out very well as a  matter of fact why this reconciliation  bill should not have extraneous mat ters on it. It is also true, is it not, that,  just from a sheer point of equity and  fairness,  this should be upheld as a  point of order; for that basis if noth ing else, just on basis of equity, that is  some 27 States are being treated un fairly? Is that not true?  ",1990
1517,757,21,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President,  the  Senator  is absolutely correct. There  will be 27 States who will lose if this  provision is enacted into law. That is  very unfair to 27 States who have not  had the opportunity to debate the al location formula in the due course of  the highway funding bill which will  come up on the next Congress.  ",1990
1518,770,21,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President,  I  join  many others of my colleagues who  have  spoken  their  opposition  this  morning to the proposed changes in  the Federal  Highway Administration  minimum  allocation  formula  con tained  in  the budget summit agree ment.  I  think the adoption of the 95-per cent mmunum  allocation  formula  from its current 85 percent would set a  very dangerous precedent and is bad  public policy. In addition, the 95 per cent proposal  is  ill-timed and com pletely inappropriate as part of this  budget effort when the entire highway  program  is  due  for  reauthorization  next year. As has been so eloquently  stated by my colleagues, the minimum  allocation formula has nothing to do  with deficit reduction and everything  to do with the shape and character of  future national highway policy.  Utah is one of the States that will be  sorely penalized by such a  change.  Utah normally receives more in trans portation funds than are collected in  the State. On the surface  this may  seem unfair. However,  the reality  is  that this is a correct policy and should  be continued.  The State of Utah has been charged  with constructing  large numbers of  miles of highways across unpopulated,  Federal lands that provide no tax base  to the State coffers. Many times these  lands are primarily used by non-Uta hans engaged  in  recreation or com merce. It is not fair that Utah would  be asked to maintain these roads with  a  smaller share of Federal support  that was given to construct them. The  Utah Department of Transportation  estimates  that Utah would  lose  at  least $10 million per year in revenue  under this proposal. That is a  large  chunk of money to my State and its  loss would have a devastating impact  on Utah's ability to keep and maintain  the Federal highways as they should  be.  I do not think this proposal should  be included in any Federal highway re authorization. But I  think it is espe cially onerous and inappropriate that  it has been proposed as part of this  budget reconcilation bill.  ",1990
1519,770,21,Mr. KERREY.," Mr.  President,  I  would like to rise today to add to the  comments of Senator BAucus, among  others, oppose an effort to raise the  minimum allocation of highway trust  fund moneys from 85  to 95 percent.  This provision would  seriously hurt  and be unfair  to  the economies of  largely rural States such as Nebraska.  This provision would  increase  the  minimum  allocation-the minimum  payback 19 States are currently entitled  to receive from  their payments  into the highway trust fund-from 85  to 95 percent. By increasing the mini mum allocation to these 19 States we  would dramatically decrease the pool  of funds available to rural States like  Nebraska to maintain their highway  infrastructure.  Supporters of  the  increased mini mum allocation argue that with the  near  completion  of  the  Interstate  Highway System we need to develop a  more equitable formula for the distri bution of highway trust fund moneys.  Mr. President, I find this argument cu rious because  it neglects  the  impor tance of the ongoing need for rebuild ing and maintenance of that system.  These demands are tremendous and it  would be shortsighted to neglect them  at a time that we need to strengthen  our country's infrastructure.  Further,  to  those  Senators who  argue that equity demands an increase  in  the minimum allocation,  I would  point out  that  this  is an argument  that we  neglect  to  apply when  it  comes  to other forms of Federal in vestments. If we consider the alloca tion of military  spending,  research  spending, spending under  the provi sions of  the  savings and  loan bill,  along with  billions  and billions of  other Federal dollars, it is clear that  behind the equity argument relating  to the minimum allocation formula is  another effort to draw dollars away  from rural America.  For these reasons I applaud the deci sion of the Chair to remove the provi sion  increasing the minimum alloca tion of highway trust fund revenues  from the Senate reconciliation bill.  ",1990
1520,770,21,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Chair is prepared to rule. The provi sion is contained in the title submitted  by  the Finance Committee  to  the  budget reconciliation bill. The provi sion  apportions  highway  funds  be tween the States, which is within the  jurisdiction of  the Environment and  Public Works Committee, and there fore violates  subsection  (d)(l)(C) of  the Byrd rule.  The point of order is sustained, and  the provision, pursuant to the rule, is  stricken from the bill.  Mr. SYMMS addressed the Chair.  ",1990
1521,770,21,The PRESIDING OFFICER., For  what purpose does the Senator from  Idaho rise? Time is controlled.  AMENDMENT NO. 3011  ,1990
1522,770,21,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, I send  an amendment to the desk.  ",1990

Strike section 7405 of the bill (relating to  increase and extension of highway related  taxes and trust fund).  Mr. DOMENIC!. Mr. President,  I  think I have an understanding with  Senator SYMMS  that goes something  like this: He has sent his amendment  to the desk. He will not object if we  now permit  the distinguished chair. man of the Finance Committee to take  up to 10 minutes-is that what the dis tinguished chairman wants, 10 min utes; 15 minutes?  ",1990
1524,770,21,Mr. BENTSEN.," I would like 15 min-  utes.  Mr. DOMENIC!. Up to 15 minutes  for his opening remarks, and Senator  SYMMS  would  proceed  immediately  thereafter with the time as allocated  on his amendment.  ",1990
1525,770,21,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,"  Is  there objection to the request of the  Senator from New Mexico? If not, it is  so ordered. The Senator from Texas is  recognized for 15 minutes. And there after, the Senator from Idaho is recog nized-what was  the  request of  the  Senator from New Mexico for the Sen ator from Idaho?  Mr. DOMENIC!. Immediately after.  ",1990
1526,770,21,The PRESIDING OFFICER., For  what period of time?  Mr. DOMENIC!.  I believe  that  is  controlled by  law. The Senator has  not agreed to relinquish his time. I be lieve he has 2 hours.  ,1990
1527,770,21,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,"  In  other words,  the Senator does not  make any request.  Mr. DOMENIC!. He may relinquish  some, but that is what he has.  ",1990

1532,770,21,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, I will  not ask to waive the point of order, be cause I understand the legitimacy of a  procedural point. But I  shall advise  the Senate I will rise again on that  particular issue, insofar as the formula  is  restructured next year,  and will  strongly support  the  idea  that  the  donor States get a better deal.  Mr. President, what we are doing  here today is dealing with a decade of  indulgence by this country of ours; a  decade of writing $150 billion worth of  hot checks; regrettably the American  people do not understand nor have  they been advised of the depth of the  problem. It has taken us months to  come to this point. One of the reasons  it has taken us so long is that we are  living under the illusion that we can  spend on and on and on, without ever  havingto pay for it.  That is no longer the case. It is im portant that the Congress and this ad ministration help the American people  to understand the economic problems  we face and what these deficits mean  for the future of this country.

1542,783,21,Mr.  SASSER.," Madam  President,  during my years in the Senate, I have  traditionally  opposed  and.  voted  against increases in what is commonly  called a gasoline tax. That is a misno mer of sorts because the so-called gas oline tax is principally a user fee. The  overwhelming majority of the funds  that are collected as a fee on motor  fuels are used to fund the roads and  bridges  and  highways  over which  those who own and operate motor ve hicles travel.  evidence of  that, motor  fuels  which are used on the farm by farmers  in tractors which do not traverse the  highways are not subject to these user  fees or so-called gasoline taxes. But I  have always opposed increases in these  user fees because I have felt that they  worked an undue hardship on  the  people of my State, and I have felt  that  these user  fees were  to  some  extent regressive. And lastly, I have  always felt that this was a source of  revenue that ought to be reserved to  the several States. rather than being  taken as a source of revenue by the  Federal Government.  But  times  change,  and  as  times  change one must change one's views.  The infrastructure in this country is  As  It  in  terrible condition.  is suffering  from  really 12 years of neglect; 12  years in which we reduced the revenue  base of this Government of ours by 20  percent, at a  time when we were in cre~ing defense,  in nominal dollars,  by about 50 percent.  Some effort was made to make up  the difference by reductions in domes tic spending and in domestic discre tionary  spending.  I  suspect we will  hear during the course of this debate a  very learned and persuasive discourse  from  the distinguished chairman of  the Senate Appropriations Committee  who will outline in graphic detail how  this effort to reduce spending by cut ting  the  domestic  discretionary  ac counts has diminished the ability of  this country to compete in the inter national markets and diminished our  ability to at least enhance the quality  of life of our citizens.  But, having said that, as this domes tic  spending has been  reduced, we  have seen the infrastructure, the high ways and the bridges, take the hits. I  had a bridge  in my native State of  Tennessee that collapsed a year and a  half ,ago. Five or six people perished  because this bridge fell  into a  river.  They came over a crest of a hill to tra verse  the bridge and no bridge was  there, and they went into the river. A  whole family was lost. It took days to  find them.  Potholes are all over the Interstate  System. Bridges are shaky and collaps ing. We need to do more on the roads  and highways. So for that reason, I am  going to back a way from a long held  view  that  I would not  support  in creases  in highway user  fees,  a  so called motor fuels tax. I am going to  support it today with reluctance be cause it is absolutely necessary.  Second, 50 percent of this levy will  be allocated to deficit reduction. When  we put it into deficit reduction, then it  no  longer becomes a user fee but it  then indeed becomes a tax.  Now, why would I reverse 14 years of  votes today on the Senate floor to do  that? I do it because this Nation of  ours is facing a financial crisis, a fiscal  crisis, if you will. This Nation of ours  is  slowly but surely going bankrupt  before our very eyes. We have seen  ourselves move from the largest credi tor Nation just 12 years ago to now we  are the largest debtor Nation in the  world.  The external debt of the country of  Brazil pales  to  insignificance when  compared to that of the United States.  We in this Government are mortgag ing our future and the future of our  heirs. And that mortgage is being held  by the Japanese investors, by German  investors, by other foreign  investors  who are coming  in and slowly but  surely purchasing the ability of our  Government to control its own desti ny, to control its own affairs.

1550,796,21,Mr. ARMSTRONG.,"  I  thank  the  chair, and  I  thank my  friend  from  New Mexico for yielding me the time.  Mr. President, this is a very interest ing discussion this afternoo::.1, but I do  not want to lose track of what I think  is  the main question.  I believe  the  main issue is, do we want to raise taxes  as America's economy lurches into a  recession? is raising taxes in the teeth  of a recession a good idea? That is the  main issue.  This bill, which appears on the desks  of Senators,  is several  inches  thick,  but you can boil it down to its main es sentials pretty quickly.  There is about $169 billion in taxes  and user fees in here; $180 billion in  defense cuts and savings of one kind or  another, savings which, by the way,  will occur, whether or not we adopt  this package. Later,  I want  to  talk  about whether this package is the only  alternative  and whether  there  are  other ways to get there. I will tell you  that 180 billion dollars' worth of cuts  will occur whether we pass the pack age this day, this week, or ever.  Then there is $65 billion in assump tion about interest rate savings. Those  are the three big pieces of it. We have  a $500 billion package here, and over  $400 billion of it is in just those three  pieces:  a  tax  increase, defense cuts,  and  an  assumption  about  interest  rates savings. Make no mistake, this  highly  touted piece of  legislation  is  first, last, and always a big increase in  taxes, an increase in the income tax,  an increase in the gasoline tax, the to bacco  tax, and the tax on beer and  wine, and on boats, airports, airplanes,  telephone  taxes, and an  increase  in  the health insurance tax, and a lot of  other increased taxes and fees.  In fact, Mr. President, I hope my col leagues will take a moment sooner or  later to look through the summary of  the Senate  reported bill. There are  $142 billion in explicit taxes, and then  a  list of the savings which are pro posed in addition to the tax increases.  When you look at the savings, it turns  out that they are, for the most part, or  at least in large part, fees.  For  example,  under  agriculture,  scored as a spending reduction, is the  APHIS fee; then there is the bank in surance  fund  increase; Coast Guard  user fee; railroad safety inspection fee;  National Weather Service fee; tourism  user  fee;  uranium  enrichment  fee;  EPA service fee; Nuclear Regulatory  Commission fee; Army Corps recrea tion fee; and the list goes on and on  and on.  That is in addition to the limitation  on itemized deductions, the practical  effect of which is to raise $30 billion  more  from  income  taxpayers. The  motor fuel  tax  increase goes up 9 ¥2  cents, more  than double  that  tax.  There are other taxes, which I have  mentioned, on tobacco, alcohol, auto",1990

1552,809,21,Mr. BYRD., Yes.  ,1990
1553,809,21,Mr. GORE.," Mr. President,  only for a brief comment.  Mr.  President,  there was  just  a  major study by one of  the  leading  technical  institutes of higher educa tion in the United States, which fo cused on the precise point the distin guished  President  pro  tempore  is  making at this very moment. A team  of management analysts, economists,  and scientists joined forces to analyze  all of the factors that can be said to  influence national productivity growth  in nations around the world.  This is a controversial field of study,  but it has grown increasingly sophisti cated in recent years. And this particu lar team ended up by  identifying as  the one factor most influential in de termining the relative rate of produc tivity growth  in nations around  the  world, the level of nondefense public  investment, such as in infrastructure.  I have been one who has argued that  we should expand the definition of in frastructure to include not only roads  and bridges, as has been the common  definition in the past, but now fiber  optic  cables  and  information  infra structure and the like.  In any event, I was intrigued by this  study and  the close correlation be tween the conclusions of this team of  experts and the point being made by  the distinguished President pro  tem pore, which  just now provoked  this  brief intervention.  I thank my colleague for his courte sy in yielding.  ",1990
1554,809,21,Mr. BYRD.,"  I  thank my  distin guished colleague from Tennessee for  the emphasis he has placed upon the  importance of nondefense public  in vestment and how it relates to produc tivity growth.  Let us take now the human side of  infrastructure. This  chart  indicates  the  relative standing of  the United  States among a total of 16 nations, in  respect to education spending-grades  K through 12, for the year 1985.  We do very well with postsecondary  education. Students come from other  countries  to  the United States  to  study. But from K through 12, we are  cheating our kids. On this chart, we  find that in K through 12 spending, as  a percent of gross national product, in  1985 the United States ranked 14th in  a  list of 16 nations-14th-spending  just 4.1 percent of the gross national  product. The lowest was Ireland with  3.8; and Australia, 3.9. The rest of the  countries spent a higher percent of  the gross national product on chil dren's education  from  kindergarten  through the 12th year.  Let us see how that reflects on the  achievement in science. On the left of  the chart is the rank in order for 10year-olds, grades 4 through 5. This is a  list of 15 nations. The United States is  No. 8 in a listing of those 15 nations.  By the time they reach the age of 14  and are  in grades 8 and 9, see how  they have gone down. In a  list of 17  nations, the United States is in a  tie  with two other nations for 13th place.  Singapore, Thailand, and the United  States are all tied for 13th place, with  only Hong Kong and the Philippines  at the bottom. And the other coun tries  listed above  the United States  are: Italy, England, Australia, Norway,  Poland,  Korea,  Sweden,  Finland,  Canada, The Netherlands, Japan, and  Hungary-Germany does not show up  on the chart because, it is my under standing,  there were no  figures  for  Germany; they were not available at  that point.  Isn't  this a drab, dreary picture of  what we are doing to our kids? When  it comes to spending Federal funding  for the education of our kids in grades  K through 12, look what it is ultimate ly doing to meet the country's need for  scientists.  This  is a chart  that projects  the  supply and demand for science and en gineering  Ph.D's per  year  in  the  United States. The green indicates the  number of  science  and  engineering  Ph.D.'s that are coming out of the res ervoir of U.S. citizens and permanent  residents annually.  Observers will note that the line is  fairly  level  beginning  in  1988  and  going to the year 2006, fairly level, at  about 10,000 to 12,000 Ph.D's per year  that  are  being  turned out  in  the  United States from  the reservoir of  U.S. citizens and permanent residents.  And  the yellow  coloring  represents  foreign  students who  come  to  the  United States to get their science and  engineering Ph.D.'s, but half of them  return  to  their native countries. So,  considering  that  there may be half  who remain here, it means that we an nually produce in this country some thing  like  from 11,000  to 13,000 or  14,000 Ph.D's from  this reservoir of  U.S. citizens and permanent residents  and foreign students. The red coloring   represents the projected demand for  science and engineering Ph.D.'s show ing that the year 2006 the demand in  the United States will be for about  23,500 or 24,000 Ph.D's per year. And,  of course as I have indicated, we will  meet only a little better than half of  that need by the year 2004.  Mr. President, I have taken the time  of the Senate to address three defi cits-the trade deficit, the Federal def icit, and the investment deficit.  Unless we do something to address  the horrors that these charts portray,  we are a Nation that is headed for a  fall. The reconciliation bill before the  Senate makes a start toward address ing these problems that I have been  talking about.  And there are efforts in this Senate  today, by way of amendments that are  being offered,  to  tear  the package  apart.  I attended the summit. I never want  to attend another. I do not expect to  ever attend another one, even though  I may live to be as old as Methuselah,  and he lived to be 969 years old. I do  not want to attend any more summits.  As the summit here is what we did.  Everybody put on  their green eye shades and they looked at figures and  formulas.  I  took  the position  there,  and  I  take  the position here,  that  while we not only have to deal with  the Federal deficit, and the meeting of  targets, and shaving a little here, shav ing a little there, and shaving a little  somewhere else, what we are  really  talking about actually is a 5-year plan  for the Nation. So we ought to take  off our green eyeshades and, in addi tion to discussing the figures, the tar gets, the outlay levels and all of those  important  things  regarding Gramm Rudman-Hollings, we  also want  to  think about this country and where we  are going for the next 5 years.  I  tried  to bring  the summit away  from the green eyeshades, away from  a  total concentration on figures and  targets-important though they are using pencils and erasers, and cutting  a little here and a little there, meeting  this  Gramm-Rudman  target,  and  meeting that Gramm-Rudman target,  and all that, but also to stop and take  a look at the forest and not just at the  trees and to consider the fact that we  are actually considering a 5-year plan  for this country. Where are we headed  in  this country? And where are we  going to be at the end of the 5-year  period?  I happen to believe that this country  still has the spirit to which de Tocque",1990
1555,822,21,Mr. SYMMS.,"  If the Senator will  yield for a reply to that, it would be  either we  table the Mitchell amend ment, and no Senator likes  to  table  the majority leader's amendment, or if  we  just vote  it up or down, vote  it  down and  then  the Symms amend ment is still the pending business.  We can vote on that. I cannot con trol that course. I believe the Republi can leader may have a second-degree  amendment to offer to the Mitchell  amendment.  ",1990
1556,822,21,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President, if  I have any remaining time, I observe  to the Senator, first of all, that I think  he is to be congratulated for attempt ing  to bring  this  issue before  the  Senate. It is an important issue; it is  an issue which affects the lives and  economic well-being  of millions  of  American families.  I  think the overwhelming majority  of them will be on the Senator's side.  But I  think if they fully understood  the round-the-barn, back-door process  that we have to go through to get a  vote on this, they would be as upset  about it as some of the Senators are  tonight.  At this point, we do not have any  choice. The only way to get to where  we want to go is either to vote down  the Mitchell amendment or vote  to  table it. But I hope when it is all over,  however it turns out, there is not any  Senator that has the temerity to go  home and say to constituents ""No, on  the gas tax, I did not vote against the  Symms amendment on the gas tax; I  was just voting on procedural amend ments or voting on another subject,  just a parliamentary situation.""  Every  Senator  should  recognize  what they are voting on is the gas tax  amendment and that is what they will  be recorded on when the time comes.  ",1990
1557,822,21,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President,  I am  happy to yield 10 minutes to the Sena tor from Wyoming.  ",1990
1558,822,21,Mr. WALLOP.," Mr. President, I shall  not use 10 minutes but I would like to  echo the words of the Senator from  Colorado. Whether  or  not  people  think that his amendment is responsi ble, given the emergency, as we have  all been led to believe exists, the fact  is  that  those of us who support  it  ought to be by rights entitled to a vote  on  it. We will not be.  I understand  that. But the more awkward thing for  someone who is a Senator, who claims  to have pride in representing his State  and people of America in this so-called   world's greatest deliberative body,  it  seems a shame we are not going to be  permitted to deliberate on that specif ic amendment.  It also seems a shame to this Sena tor that the situation as described by  the Senator from Idaho as it relates  specifically  to  the  distribution  of  funds to the highway trust fund and  to deficit reduction is simply not quite  the case, and Americans should under stand it.  We cannot devote a proportion of  the money to the highway trust fund  and then cap the amount of moneys  that can be appropriated from  that  fund and in all honesty, and I say that  word specifically, in all honesty claim  that you are doing anything for the  highway trust fund for the Senators'  States. For the Senator from Tennes see who was worried about a bridge  that fell in his State and killed some  people, it is not going to be affected or  helped or aided in any single way by  the action that the Senate is about to  undertake tonight.  So, to be honest with the American  people, that seems a difficult thing for  the Senate to do and the Congress to  do in these days. We really should tell  them that what we are doing is raising  their taxes on the gasoline that they  buy, not to  improve their highways,  their roads,  their infrastructure, and  all the things that the Senator from  West Virginia spoke of, but in fact to  spend more money on more programs  such as that we passed last night when  we started a brand new program and a  brand  new  spending  program  for  Americans, and I am speaking in par ticular about that volunteers in service  to America bill.  Curiously enough, the volunteers are  all paid volunteers, too, and that is an other one of those curious uses of the  English language that the Senate has  become quite adept at trying to per suade Members they are doing some thing  to appeal  to  their generosity  when,  in fact,  they are appealing to  their avarice.  But it is not the right thing for this  Senate to do, to deny any Members of  the Senate the opportunity to vote on  the gas tax. My State is affected more  than any other State by the gas tax.  We have to drive farther to work be cause we have fewer people and an  enormous territorial expanse, and sta tistically our people drive farther to  work than do all the rest of Ameri cans.  But even if it were not the case of  just Wyoming, I would ask the Senate  tonight to examine who it is that is af fected by the gas tax. Who drives the  oldest cars? Not the richest Americans  that our colleagues on the other side  would have us believe they are trying  to ding and to get to pay their fair  share. It is  the bottom edge of  the  middle class that has the oldest cars  that consume the most gasoline and  who, by and large, drive the farthest  to work.  Think of the carpenter who lives out  in Olney, MD, who is under subcon tract in a project in the District. He  has to drive every day or he does not  have a  job. You are taxing his liveli hood and not to give him better roads  or to give him better transportation.  Or the nurse who may come in from  40 or 50 miles outside of Washington  to work in a hospital in Washington.  These are the people most affected by  this rise in the gas tax.  Yet our leadership is saying tonight  that we do not deserve a vote on that,  much the same way the leadership in  the House denied the Republicans an  opportunity to present to the House of  Representatives  an  opportunit~  to  vote on the means of securing the re duction  in the deficit that this pro gram does without taxes.  Why? Because  it had a chance of  passage.  Somehow or another we have -fixat ed ourselves on some sort of guilt trip  that somehow Americans are overin dulged by their Government. I remem ber days  in  the Finance Committee  when they used to talk about tax ex penditures. And the theory of a  tax  expenditure is very simple. The theory  of a tax expenditure is that everything  you earn belongs first to the Govern ment and you get to keep what you  keep by grace of that Government, not  in support of that Government but by  grace of that Government. And that is  ",1990

The  income standard  is  based on 133¥3 percent of the State's  single AFDC payment standard for a house hold of similar size. But for 20 years  there has been an exception. States  . have had the option of calculating the  income standard for medically needy  single adults based on the AFDC pay Finance  Committee  reconciliation  package our provision clarifying how  States set income tests for single indi viduals  in  the Medicaid medically  needy program. This is good news for  the 2,000 low-income and disabled Ver monters whose Medicaid benefits have  been threatened since the administration requested a change in the income  tests last year.  In its fiscal year 1990 budget, the ad in writing a ministration  proposed  a  regulatory  change that would remove an option  States have had for the last 20 years  allowing  them  to set more generous  income levels for single adults in the  DEAR LLoYD: We are writing regarding the  Finance Committee's upcoming  consideration of the FY 1991 budget reconciliation  legislation.  Last year, the Administration proposed in Chairman BENTSEN for including in his  its FY 1990 budget a regulatory change regarding the medically needy income levels  for one-member families under state Medicaid programs. This regulation would have  had the effect of rendering thousands of  single aged, blind, and disabled adults ineligible for Medicaid in at least 17 states.  With your assistance,  language was  included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 which placed a one year  moratorium on the implementation of the  proposed regulation. In February of 1990,  twenty-two Senators  joined  letter to Secretary Sullivan requesting that  he review and reconsider his proposal  to  change the regulations with respect to the  medically needy  income  levels. Secretary  Sullivan acknowledged our correspondence, Medicaid medically needy program.  but we are unaware of any effort within the  Administration to date to give this matter  serious reconsideration. Because this ban is  due to expire on December 31, 1990, we are  seeking your assistance  in  resolving  this  issue permanently.  As you may recall, current regulationswhich have been in effect for more than 20 medically needy  years-state that in determining the medically  needy  income  levels  for  a  person, states may utilize a methodology  that is 1331/a percent of the amount ""reasonably related to the highest money payment which would ordinarily be made under the  state's AFDC plan to a family of two without income and resources."" Thus, even if a ment for a household of two instead of  state has an AFDC payment  level  for a  family of one child, since that level is not  related  to  the  reasonable maintenance  needs of a medically needy adult, a state medically needy household of one ormay set different levels to take into account  the greater needs of an adult. This practice  is wholly consistent with current law.  The Administration's  proposed  regulations would forbid states from implementing  the ""reasonable  relatedness""  requirement  when such states have an AFDC payment  standard for one person. Since all states more single individuals. For thousands  have  such AFDC payment standards, no  state would be permitted to continue its current policy.  Lloyd, we would very much appreciate  your including a provision in this year's reconciliation  legislation  that would protect  the single person medically needy  income  level  in those states which, as of June 1.  1989, had relied upon the current regulations. We have included draft language for  your review.  Since this provision  is codifying current  practice and regulations, we do not believe manently resolve the issue.  that  its  inclusion will  result  in  increased  costs. This provision is very similar to one  adopted in section 4106 of Public Law 100203,  which  protected California's  adult  couple medically needy income levels. CBO  found no  increased costs associated with  that provision, which also sought to codify  existing practice. we are currently in the  process of requesting a cost estimate of our ministration  proposal from CBO and will share the results with your office as soon as it's available.  of elderly and disabled Vermonters, re ceiving medical care under the medi cally  needy  program  has meant  a  chance to live independently and avoid  nursing home care.

1592,952,21,Mr. HUBBARD.," Mr. Speaker, constituents of  mine continue to ask why I have voted against  the recent budget proposals that have come  before us over the past 2 weeks. Consistently  I have answered that my constituents cannot  bear the burden of higher Federal taxes.  Yesterday,  this Chamber adopted a budget  resolution which, according  to  its sponsors,  shifts the tax burden  to the Nation's wealthi est taxpayers.  I opposed  this budget resolu tion because  I did not buy  that argument.  Others, too, have not bought it.  I draw my colleagues' attention to an excel lent editorial which appeared in today's edition  of the Paducah Sun, the largest newspaper in  my western Kentucky congressional district.  The editorial points out that a family earning  an average annual  income of $25,000 would  pay about $183  in additional  taxes. while a  family with  an  annual  income of  $36,000  would owe $280 in additional taxes.  I think that we would all agree families earn ing $25,000 or $36,000 a year are  far  from  being among America's wealthiest taxpayers.  I  congratulate  the  newspaper's  editorial  page editor. Don Gordon, and the other mem bers of the staff at the Paducah Sun for their  insight into this timely matter.  I would ask my colleagues to read this edi torial and consider  its points closely  in  the  event that we have the opportunity to consid er another budget resolution which would be  fairer to America's working middle class.  The editorial is as follows:  HOUSE POISED TO HIT MIDDLE CLASS  House Democrats. apparently emboldened  to abandon all restraint in the face of thier  opposition's weakness, have gone from a po sition of ""soaking the rich"" to one of soak ing nearly everybody who earns a paycheck.  A  tax plan that has emerged from  the  House Ways and Means committee and re portedly enjoys broad party support in the  House would hit all but the poorest taxpay ers. For instance, families earning an aver age of about $25,000 would pay about $183  more per year. For those averaging about  $36,000,  the additional  tax bill would be  $280.  From protectors  like  American middle class.  these, deliver  the  October 17, 1990  One way the House tax writers would in crease  the  revenue  take  is by depriving  wage-earners of their tax protection against  inflation next year. It seems many members  of Congress are interested in cost-of-living  indexing only when it protects entitlements,  not earnings.  The entire budget process started down hill when President Bush  repudiated his  own no-new-taxes pledge and it has been ac celerating ever since.  And now  the administration apparently  has abandoned the field completely to the  Democratic  congressional majority,  and  that's sure to be bad news for American tax payers.  If the budget had been squeezed dry of  unnecessary and wasteful spending, the tax  plan might go down better. But of course  spending continues unabated and anyone  who believes Congress won't find ways to  spend the new revenue envisioned  in  the  House  tax package hasn't been watching  that august body in action in recent years.  President Bush, whose performance in the  budget fiasco over the past several weeks  does him no credit, can yet redeem himself  by using his remaining weapon. It's called a  veto.  WORKING TOGETHER IN  HIGHER EDUCATION  HON. JOSEPH M. GAYDOS  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 17, 1990  ",1990
1593,952,21,Mr. GAYDOS.," Mr. Speaker,  there  is  little  doubt that funding for education. especially for  higher education  through student assistance,  is one of the critical  issues facing us  today.  What's more,  with  reauthorization  of  the  Higher Education Act of 1965 coming up next  year,  it  is  likely  that the debates on student  aid, both loan, and grant programs, will inten sify.  One of the elements of the debate focuses  on providing assistance for middle income stu dents who are increasingly not eligible for the  more  traditional Stafford Guaranteed  Loan  Program and the Pell Grant Program.  Another element focuses on finding ways of  realistically controlling student defaults in  the  loan programs, with a special emphasis on  those students in the career training sector of  higher education.  Today, I want to address those issues. First,  I will touch on a singular effort by Pennsylva nia's State  treasurer. Catherine Baker Knoll,  to support a special loan program in the Com monwealth primarily for students from middle and upper-middle-income families.  Then  I will describe a new program devel oped by a career  training school as a step  toward  guaranteeing  repayment  of  student  loans.  And,  finally,  I will  focus on some positive  contributions that career training schools, their  faculties, and  their students. make  to  their  communities.  Just a short while ago, a unique agreement  was reached between the Pennsylvania treas urer and  the State's designated guarantee  agency  for  the  title  IV  student  loan  pro grams-the Pennsylvania Higher Education  Assistance Agency-that will ensure the con",1990

",1990
1604,1082,21,Mr. JEFFORDS.," I think it is impor tant that while we are on this impor tant piece of legislation we also give  some consideration to the impact the  Middle East crisis will have as the days  unfold. The purpose of my amend ment is to hopefully allow us to be in  position when we return next spring to  be able to devise a plan that will get us  off of the dependency on oil from the  Middle East.  It is a relatively simple amendment  that I am offering and yet its ramifica tions could be quite dramatic. What  my amendment does very simply is it  says that we should take a  look at a  program that will get us in a position  where we can use our indigenous re sources,  to be able to substitute our  motor fuels for  indigenous resources  such that we can on an increasing per centage get rid of more and more of  .  the imported oils and necessity for our  motor fuels.  The Middle East is not something  that is going to go away. We thought  it was. We had a crisis  in the mid 1970's and we at that time considered  all sorts of options we should consider  to get us in a position where we would  no longer be dependent upon imported  oil. For instance, the amendment I am  offering  today was offered at  that  time. It had over 100 cosponsors in the  House. It passed out of two full committees and one subcommittee in an   effort to have a program to get us out  of that dependency. However, OPEC  folded in the sense of its ability to con trol oil and we ended up with that pro gram not being approved.  What this program say  is that we  have enough indigenous resources in  th N t'  is  a ion wi  th th  e proper program  to manufacture our o~ motor fuels  and that we should do this.  Now, how do we do  this? Well, we  tried a program in the 1970's which  did not work, and I want to make sure  people understand  this  is not  that  kind of a program. We mandated a  supply. We sai? let us create a Synfuels Corporation  to produce a  syn thetic substance to get rid of the need  for  the  importation. That failed,  it  failed miserably because you cannot  mandate a supply and make it work  unless you have huge subsidies.  My program goes the opposite direction;  it  says we will mandate  the  demand. We will reassure those who  want  to manufacture or  to produce  something  that will  replace  the  im ported oil that there will be a market  for it.  Now, it also will work in concert with  the clean air bill for  the program I  have proposed, which was printed on  Tuesday in the RECORD, says we should  also give extra incentive to those fuels  which are cleaner so that at the same  time we get ourselves off of the de pendency of Mideastern oil we will  have distribution systems available to  enable us also to have the clean fuels  necessary to also clean up the air.  I  have  discussed  this with  the  Energy Committee personnel and I be lieve that it is acceptable to them.  I would also like to ask unanimous  consent to add Senator CONRAD BURNS  as a cosponsor of this amendment.  I would be happy to at this point  yield to the Senator from Idaho.  ",1990
1605,1082,21,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from Idaho.  Mr. McCLURE. Thank  you, Mr.  President,  I  thank  the Senator  for  yielding the floor at this point.  I ask unanimous consent that I be  added as original cosponsor of  the  amendment.  ",1990

1607,1095,21,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, I believe  that the reconciliation bill asks  too  much of middle  income  taxpayers,  who are having a hard time making  ends meet, at the same time that it  does not ask enough of the wealthiest  members of our society, who benefited  the most  from  the decade  of  the  1980's. That is why I oppose the gasoline tax increase in this bill. It is the  wrong tax at the wrong time.  The  Gore-Mikulski  amendment  would improve the reconciliation bill  by eliminating the additional burdens  that are placed on Medicare recipients  by  the provisions  in  this bill. This  amendment would  also  ""burst  the  income tax bubble"" so that the high est  income  taxpayers would pay the  highest marginal  income  tax rate.  I  have long supported doing that. Fun damental fairness requires no less.  However, the Gore-Mikulski amend ment includes a 6-cent gasoline tax in crease. Although this is less than the  amount in the reconciliation bill, it is  still, even at 6 cents, the wrong tax at  the wrong time. That is why I will vote  against  the  Gore-Mikulski  amend ment. However,  I will  support  the  amendment which Senator HARKIN in tends to offer to raise  the taxes on  those with incomes over $1 million and  reduce the Medicare cuts in this bill.  Mr. BENTSEN addressed the Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER  (Mr.  BURDICK). The Senator from Texas.  ",1990
1608,1095,21,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, what  we are trying to do is take care of a  . decade of indulgence, a decade when  we wrote $150 billion and more in hot  checks year after year, piling on the  debt for future generations. But now  those hot checks are coming due. I can  recall seeing a kid with a T-shirt that  said, ""How can I be broke? I still have  checks."" That has been the attitude  that we have seen for a dozen years  now.  Last year, I walked out of the budget  summit meeting and said  there was  too much blue smoke and mirrors, too  much  creative  accounting;  that  it  would not work. Time has proven that  right. We did not have too much trou ble putting  together a  solution  last  time because the agreement did not  call for a credible cut.  It was tough this time putting the  budget together because we have done  a credible cut. We are talking about  some $40 billion in the first year. We  are talking about $500 billion over the  next 5 years. We have had 5 months of  negotiation in the budget summit, and  11 days of intensive negotiation in the  Finance Committee between Republi cans and Democrats.  I went down and visited with  the  President to talk to him about a 33percent rate. We had some indecision  in the White House for a while as to  whether  he would  or whether he  would not support that proposal, de pending on which day. We  restruc tured the plan to try to accommodate  for that.  Do I think the wealthy should pay  more  in  this country? Yes,  I do.  I  watched what  happened when we  looked at the last decade as to who  gained  income and who did not.  I  looked at the average family, middle income  family  from  the 40-percent  quintile to the 60-percent quintile. Av erage family  incomes  increased by 3  percent. The top six-tenths of 1 per cent increased by 87 percent. Ability to  share  the burden, and capability of  paying taxes has to be a part of the  consideration.  I  think we  ought  to  break  the  bubble. I think the top rate ought to  be 33 percent. I think that is the way  to address the problem, but the Presi dent of the United States says he will  not  sign  such  legislation. My good  friend,  the  ranking member of  the  committee, has said that just within  the last few hours, he has been told  that  the President would veto such  legislation.  This is a compromise. So we came  through the back door to try to see  that those who are best able to share  this burden of cutting this deficit pay  their fair share. I must say I  think  most of them are ready to and expect  to.  So we took itemized deductions and  wiped  those out  to  the extent  they  exceed 5 percent of adjusted gross  income for those people over $100,000.  We brought together a package that  raises some $29 billion with that pro posal. Then we took the health insur ance payroll tax, which is at a 1.45percent rate on the first $50,000 or so  of income. I originally proposed rais ing that cap  to $125,000. We finally  compromised at $89,000, a substantial  increase, and picked up some $19 bil lion in that process. Then we put a tax  on luxury goods. When we finished,  we had an increase of over $50 billion  that hit those who could best afford it  in this country.  It is a compromise, trying to put a  package together. Here we have had  almost 16 hours of debate. It is not a  perfect bill, but a bill I think that will  do the job and increase the progressiv ity of our tax system.  As I look at what we brought out of  the  summit, with  those with  the  lowest  income having an increase in  taxes of some 7 percent, and those at  the  top having an  increase  in  their  taxes of 1. 7 percent, I note that that is  not the case with the one we brought  out of  the Finance Committee. We  had 15 out of 20 members of that com mittee, bipartisan, a majority of both  sides, vote for this compromise. But it  has progressivity. Instead of a 1.7-per cent increase for  those who are the  wealthiest,  it is now 3. 7 percent. In stead of a 7-percent increase on the  poorest, it is zero. They are held harm less. Those are the positive things that  have  been  accomplished with  this  package.  We are up against tight deadlines.  What we have tried to do is put to gether a package the President would  sign. We have substantial divergence  from what has come out of the House,  and we will go into conference and, ob",1990

1613,1108,21,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from New Mexico.  Mr. DOMENIC!. Madam President,  let me just state to the Senate, I un derstand that in opposition we have  Senator ROTH, who wants to speak for  about 10 minutes; and we probably  will yield back time so we can get on  with things. I yield myself 3 minutes.  First,  let me say  that  I  have  to  oppose  the  amendment,  simply be cause we have been busy trying to put  together a package of deficit reduction  proposals, including revenue measures  and other savings,  reforms, and the  like, for nigh on 5 months. And every  time we got to a point where we could  not move ahead, it had to do with this  issue. If not precisely, almost.  It was capital gains; no capital gains;  raise the brackets; do not raise them.  Frankly, I believe that we would be  performing a rather idle act to tell our  conferees to do what we know will not  succeed.  We  have  defeated  a  number  of  amendments on the basis that if we  went to conference with those, there is  no way to get a deficit reduction pack age.  Having said that, I say to my good  friend  from Georgia and  the senior  Senator from Oklahoma, it is refresh ing-I have already stated my position  and why I must be there, but let me  say to them-it is refreshing to hear  two U.S. Senators talk about the lack  of growth and sustained productivity  as a major American problem. We are  blissfully thinking that because Amer ica has succeeded in the past, we are  just going  to continue competing  in  this world; our productivity is going to  continue upwards; inflation is going to  come down.  I am very appreciative, as one Sena tor,  that two Senators  talked about  the fact  that we ought  to seriously  look at what we can do to make Amer ica have a better chance of producing  jobs, investment, and growth.  When I  first became involved as a  designated negotiator,  I  had objec tives. I  think they were the same as  the President's: Get the deficit down  as much as possible in a way that is  least damaging to the American econo my;  reform  the budget  process  so  whatever you do  is believed by  the  American people. We hope to do that  before the day is out today. Next was  to do what we could to enhance Ameri ca's competitiveness and opportunity  to grow, invest and save.  What we are going to end up with is  part of the package. We are going to  get  the  deficit  down  substantially,  hopefully. They may get interest rates  down, and by cutting the deficit that  much, we may be encouraging savings  because we will not be spending sav ings on debt, at least to the extent  that we reduce the deficit. I am very  hopeful  that will  happen. The  re search and development tax credit and  a  few of the others that are in the  package indeed are necessary.  I do not believe it is possible now to  get something as significant as a real  workplace capital gains in this pack age. I personally would like to see that  happen.  I  do  not  believe  it will  happen.  I close by saying, with reference to  the Tax Code and all the talk about  the rich and the poor, I want to thank  the  distinguished  Senator  from  Oregon, Senator PACKWOOD,  for his  very enlightening remarks this morn ing.  I hope people listened to them.  ",1990

1617,1121,21,Mr.  JEFFORDS.," Mr. President,  I  want  to  speak  in  support  of  the  amendment, although I did agree with  the Senator from Ohio that we needed  to increase the maximum penalties be cause inflation had put them in a situ ation where they were somewhat ridic ulous, compared to the seriousness. I  also supported criminal penalties. I do  not support them in this bill, and I do  not support the minimum if it is not  necessary to reach our quota that we  had before our committee. As I under stand it, it is not necessary to do so be cause by doing that, by putting the  minimums in here we allow substan tial penalties for trivial things.  In my mind, we will interfere with  the process of trying to reconcile dif ferences between business and OSHA.  If we err, we should err on the side of  tampering as  little as possible with  these very basic problems  that we  have  to deal with  in  this particular  area. So I urge that the Hatch amend ment be adopted.  ",1990

1621,1121,21,Mr. HATCH.," In sum, Mr. President,  this is the small business amendment  of the year. Penalty floors of $5,000,  $1,000, and so forth are going to drive  small businesses wild. They cannot  afford to defend this type of thing in  legal proceedings. Minimum penalties  cut away  the flexibility  that OSHA  needs to be able to do its job.  I can tell you right now last year  OSHA, under its egregious policy, pe nalized several businesses in the multi million dollar  range. They are not  loathe to do that when it is appropri ate. The thing that caused OSHA to  fall into despise a few-years ago is that  it had forsaken the cooperative spirit  Congress envisioned it to be, and had  turned into a burdensome bureaucracy  that  interfered with small business.  OSHA had  turned cooperation  into  confrontation. Nothing can be worse  than what they are trying to do here  because a  return to confrontation is  what we will accomplish if we knock  these floors away. And for what? We  are within the committee's budget rec onciliation instructions by eliminating  these senseless penalty floors.  The  statement  I  read  into  the  RECORD from the National Federation  of Independent Businesses covers this  matter about as well as it can be cov ered by saying that this is a detrimen tal approach  toward small business.  This amendment will  alleviate  that  detrimental approach.  I have to tell you, OSHA has a good  role  to play  in ensuring workplace  safety and health. And, it does play a  good role with positive results. It pe nalizes those who should be penalized.  But, now it has the flexibility to tailor  those penalties to the circumstances.  Workplaces all over America are bene fiting  from  the  cooperative  spirit  OSHA has worked to achieve. Small  business people are not oppressed and  abused like they were before this type  of cooperation started. It is working  now, but,  the reconciliation package  would  jeopardize that by mandating  unreasonable penalties that are going  to be assessed, must be assessed  in  every case. What I am saying is that  the small business person does not have  the power, the money, the means or the  force to be able to do anything about it.  So it just forces the bureaucracy to  once again put us back to the situation  20 years ago, or 10 years ago when ev erybody, every small business person  hated OSHA. The days when OSHA  did not work for us, but against us.  The days when everybody fought ev erything, and in the end, what hap pened was small business was crushed  into a noncooperative spirit.  This  is what my  amendment  is  trying  to prevent. This amendment  will help to do that. It is  the small  business amendment, and I think ev erybody here ought to stop and con sider that.  I hope our colleagues will  look at  this particular issue and realize it does  not deserve to pass. It does not deserve  to be in this reconciliation bill. And,  frankly, we ought to stop it right now,  particularly since we can do so without  falling  below our  reconciliation  in structions.  I reserve the remainder of my time.  ",1990

1625,1121,21,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Two  minutes fifty seconds.  ,1990
1626,1121,21,Mr. KENNEDY.," First of all, Mr.  President, the chairman of the Budget  Committee has made it very clear that  the Labor and Human Resources Com mittee  is not in compliance with its  budget  instructions  if we knock out  these various  floors  for OSHA civil  penalties.  Second, where did the Human Re sources Committee  find  the savings  necessary to comply with its instruc tions? We had to do it by penalizing  every young person in America who is  on  a  student  loan  program. You  cannot have it both ways. If you knock  out $300 million in revenues here, it is  going to be paid for  in another way  and it is going to be taken out on the  backs of the young men and women of  this country, make no mistake about  it.  We are talking about minimum civil  penalties for those employees who are  violating the law-not innocent indi viduals, but violators of the law. I dis pute  the statement of  the Senator  from Utah  that  the  record  in  this  country in terms of workplace health  and safety and  loss of  life has  im proved in the last 5 years. It has not,  and the record shows it.  What we are talking about are mini mum penalties for serious violations,  willful violations, repeated violations  of minimal health and safety stand ards-violations which can and do cost  workers  their health and even their  lives.  Mr. President, the minimum penal ties  specified  here  are  only  the  amounts that must be assessed when  OSHA finds a violation. We are not  preventing  the agency  from settling  cases for  lower amounts. This is  the  initial assessment. Once a  fine  is as sessed, the agency retains discretion as  to how it is going to eventually get a  settlement.  The fact is that current OSHA pen alties amount to a minor slap on the  wrist for those businesses in this coun try that willfully, seriously, knowingly,  repeatedly  violate minimum health  and safety standards, and as has been  39-059 0-91-36 (Pt. 21)  ",1990

In  addition, this package takes $17 billion  directly out of the pocket's of benefici aries by raising the part B deductible  for doctor bills to $150 per year, an in crease of $75; maintaining the part B  premium at 25 percent of program  costs; and imposing a 20-percent coin surance for labs fees.  One of the most problematic Medi care cuts is the increase in the part B  deductible.  Medicare  beneficiaries  would have to pay $150 out of their  own pockets before Medicare would  pay for their doctor bills. This is twice  the current level of $75 a year.  Increasing  the part B  deductible  hurts only  those Medicare benefici aries who are sick and require health  care. Seventy-five percent of seniors  are expected to pay the full deductible  every year because of their immediate  health care needs. It takes needed outof-pocket income away from our Na tion's sick seniors and disabled people  in the same way as a cut in the Social  Security COLA.  Our proposal would eliminate the in crease in the part B deductible. This  would be offset by imposing a small  surtax on taxable income over $1 mil lion a year, making this amendment  budget  neutral.  The  amendment  would  reduce  the Medicare cuts by  $6.2 billion over 5 years.  The Medicare Program has been cut  more  than any single domestic pro gram in recent years. Changes to Med icare enacted over the past 6 years are  projected to be almost $12 billion. Ad ditional excessive cuts in Medicare will  undermine the system, reducing qual ity of care and potentially limiting the  availability of health care to people.  A $75 per year increase in the part B  deductible will adversely affect sen iors, and particularly low-income per sons. The projected average yearly  Social  Security COLA  increase  is  about $325. The part B deductible in crease translates to an over 20 percent  COLA cut for a person paying the full  deductible. Congress would not be able  to get enacted a COLA cut of that  degree. As I stated earlier, 75 percent  of seniors are expected to pay the full  deductible of $150 per year.  The cost to the average senior citi zen under the Medicare part B pro gram has been growing over the last  20 years. Seniors already lose part of  their Social Security benefit to high  Medicare costs. The current total out of-pocket  costs  for  seniors-$803  a  year-is  greater  than  an  average  monthly Social Security check of $600.  This reduces the average total Social  Security benefit by 11 percent a year.  Social Security is the major source of  income for the majority of seniors in  this country. Social Security provides  over one-half of total income for 61  percent of beneficiaries and contrib utes almost all of the income, 90 per cent or more, for one-fourth of Medi care beneficiaries.  Low-income people will be more ad versely affected by these cuts. They  are more likely to rely on Social Secu rity. In the finance bill, we accelerate  Medicaid  coverage  for  those below  poverty by 1 year and give States the  option to cover seniors with incomes  up to 125 percent of the poverty line.  This  option  is  not  enough. Only  210,000 near poor seniors are antici pated to receive benefits. There are,  however, 2.3 million near poor seniors  with incomes above poverty but less  than 125 percent of the poverty level.  The House requires Medicaid cover age, with full Federal financing,  for  low-income seniors with incomes up to  125 percent of  the poverty  level.  I  fully expect us  in the Senate-House  conference to come out with greater  ",1990

1642,1160,21,Mr. CONRAD.," I ask unanimous con sent  that an  article  entitled  ""N.D.  Farmers  Could  Lose Millions""  be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  the  [From the Grand Forks (ND) Herald, Oct.  18, 1990]  N.D. FARMERS COULD LoSE MILLIONS  <By Philip Brasher)  WASHINGTON.-The budget-squeezed farm  bill could cost North Dakota farmers mil lions of dollars in income next year, at a  time when a bumper crop worldwide has  pushed wheat prices to Depression levels.  Cuts  in federal price supports will cost  North Dakota 25 percent of its government  farm subsidies, drive down land prices and  push many struggling farmers out of busi ness, said Dwight Aakre, an economist at  North Dakota State University.  Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., who made a  last-ditch  attempt Wednesday  on  the  Senate floor to soften the blow, predicted  that North Dakota would lose more than 30  percent of its government farm support.  House and Senate negotiators finished re writing the 1990 farm bill Tuesday to ac complish $13.6 billion in spending cuts re quired by a deficit-reduction plan for the  next five years.  ""The hope  is  that will be offset by  in creases in the marketplace, but at this point  I don't see that as likely to happen,"" Aakre  said Wednesday.  North Dakota got $470 million in govern ment farm payments in 1989, mostly in crop  subsidies. That represented about 17 per cent of its total agricultural income of $2.8  billion that year, and that is a small share,  Aakre said.  Normally, federal payments account for  about a quarter of farm earnings, Aakre  said. Direct farm income, in turn, accounts  for about 10 percent of the gross state prod uct.  The compromise farm bill is designed to  save money  and  drive U.S.  agriculture  toward a more free-market policy-by reduc ing  the  acres  eligible  for  subsidies  and  giving farmers flexibility to rotate crops in  response to market demands.  However, experts say  the new  freedom  will be of less use  to Great Plains wheat  farmers because of the limited number of  crops they can plant.  A farmer in North Dakota who normally  plants  1,000  acres  to wheat would  lose  $5,200 because of a 15 percent reduction in  subsidized acres required by the farm bill.  On top of that,  the legislation requires  wheat farmers to idle another 15 percent of  their land in 1991 because of overproduction  this year that has driven wheat prices down  to near $2 a bushel.  ""It is sad to see the president and biparti san leaders (of Congress) willing to abandon  this country's commitment  to our family  farmers,"" said Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.  ""This  farm bill  is guaranteed  to drive  farm  income down and  restrict  farmers'  access to affordable credit,"" said Randolph  Nodland, a Dunn Center, N.D., grain farmer  who  is president of  the National Family  Farm Coalition.  The bill could unintentionally handicap  some of its stiffened environmental meas ures by encouraging producers to drop out  of the farm program, Nodland said.  ",1990
1643,1160,21,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President,  I  re spond  to  the distinguished Senator  simply by saying that if the Senate  chooses to adopt the amendment of fered  by  the distinguished Senator  from North Dakota, we will simply be  reducing the deficit reduction in this  overall package by $6 billion. I do not  believe the Senate wants to do that.  We have  rejected  time  after  time,  today and yesterday, motions to strike  specific provisions  that simply  took  money out of  the deficit  reduction  package and did not replace  it with  anything else.  So, Mr. President, I urge the Senate  to stand by its previous judgments on  these matters and vote to def eat the  amendment offered by my friend from  North Dakota.  ",1990

1665,1173,21,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, I won dered if our time here tonight was well  spent. The distinguished Senator from  New York has told us that on this vote  we reelect the President. If we do that,  we are doing the Lord's work, and I re joice in being part of it.  Mr. President, we have had a refer ence here to the budget process being  an oxymoron.  Mr. President, I submit if we went  out to any household in America we  would  find  that  they had a budget  process, and that budget process would  not be an oxymoron. I submit that in  any business in America, be it large or  small, they have a budget process that  is not an oxymoron.  In fact, we stand on the single spot  in the United States of America where  budget process is an oxymoron, and as  a result we are the laughing stock of  the Nation.  Mr. President, it is interesting that  after all of these remarks, we are fi nally debating, in my humble opinion,  the one part of the bill that I know is  in the interest of the people who do  the work, and pay the taxes, and pull  the wagon in this country.  Mr. President, let me outline the so called outrages we are talking about in  this amendment. The first outrage is  that we have three caps on spending  each year for 3 years, and what the  cap says is if you violate that cap, 15  days after you pass the spending bill  there  is  an across-the-board adjust ment that cuts spending back to the  level  that you said  in  law  that you  would adopt.  Mr. President, if that were submit ted to a vote of the working people of  this country, it would be adopted by  an overwhelming margin.  I hear our colleagues say there is no  enforcement,  there  is no  sequester.  Mr. President, we have more seques ters in this bill, more enforcement in  this bill by far than we have ever had  before. We have three caps that are  absolutely enforced with a mandatory  offset. We have a  sequester for  the  first time on entitlements and under performing  funding  measures. We  have  the Gramm-Rudman sequester  process strengthened with an ironclad  enforcement.  Mr. President, what we are trying to  do here  is  to do something that we  have all been concerned about. It is  easy to make promises, it is easy to  write budgets. It is very hard to live up  to  those promises  in  those budgets.  There is no  ironclad guarantee. You  cannot build legislatively a four-sided  fort where you can draw  the draw bridge up and go back to sleep. But  what we have here  is  the strongest  process we have ever had before, a  stone wall to our back in the gunfight  of those who really want to do some thing about spending.  Mr. President, I have heard the lan guage stretched to the breaking point,  but how anybody could possibly be lieve  that  by  having  binding  con straints on spending, we move  this  great Republic  toward  the financial  crises of Argentina, I find that totally  incomprehensible, and obviously I do  not believe it to be the case.  Let me say, Mr. President, that the  current vehicle that we operate on, as  imperfect as it is has worked. Let me  remind my  colleagues  that  before  1985, when on the floor of the Senate  we adopted the Gramm-Rudman-Hol lings balanced budget law, the 20 years  prior to the adoption of that law saw  Federal spending grow by 11 percent a  year.  With all of its failings since that law  went into effect, Federal spending has  grown by half of that rate. The Feder al Government was spending 23.9 per cent of GNP the day that law passed.  Today  the Federal Government  is  spending 22.4 percent of GNP.  And let me let you in on a secret.  With  this agreement fully enforced,  with moderate growth at least 80 per cent of the level we have achieved in  the last 6 years, Government spending  as a percentage of GNP in 1995, at the  end of that fiscal year, will be 18.3 per cent, 24 percent smaller than it was  when Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was  enacted in 1985.  Mr. President. I ask for 1 additional  minute.  ",1990
1666,1173,21,Mr. STEVENS.," Is the Senator going  to save time for those who want to ask  questions?  Mr. DOMENIC!. I yield 1 additional  minute, and say to the Senator I clear ly intend to.  ",1990
1667,1173,21,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator is recognized for 1 additional  minute.  ,1990
1668,1173,21,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, we do  not have a perfect device in front of  us. We have a device that is aimed at  trying  to deal with runaway entitle ments; we  have  a  device  aimed at  trying to control spending and help us  ",1990
1669,1186,21,Mr. BYRD.," If it is beyond the con trol of Congress that that is breached,  it will not be a sequester.  ",1990
1670,1186,21,Mr. GRAHAM.," So if, for  instance,  the recession that many people think  we are in or heading toward were to  result in-",1990
1671,1186,21,Mr. BYRD.," Gramm-Rudman allows  an exemption, if thel'.e are two succes sive quarters.  ",1990
1672,1186,21,Mr. GRAHAM.," If serious decline in  revenues or if other external events  cause that deficit to be greater than  $242 billion, there is no consequence in  terms  of mandatory  restrictions;  is  that correct?  ",1990
1673,1186,21,Mr. BYRD.,"  It depends  on what  causes the severe decline in the reve nue. If it is caused by a number of  things beyond the control of the Con gress, we would not be held responsi ble. If it is the fault of Congress, then  there would be sequester.  ",1990
1674,1186,21,Mr. GRAHAM.," I guess my concern  is, to put this in a sense of a family, if  you had a family, and let us say the  main source of income was real estate  commissions. They are living on a level  of $50,000 a year that was their spend ing ceiling because that is what they  had been taking in.  Now it gets to a tough year in the  real estate business. Instead of having  commissions of $50,000, you only have  commissions of $35,000. The  family  would have to make some adjustments  to bring its spending from  its tradi tional levels down to what would ac commodate this new reality of family  income.  If we were that family and had a  sudden differential or spread between  our traditional spending levels-what  we hoped and expected and what the  new reality of our income is-what are  we going to do?  ",1990
1675,1186,21,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I say to  the Senator we cannot operate like a  family, No. 1. No. 2,  this is an agree ment whereby,  if we  live up  to our  part of what is expected, we hope to  be able to cut the deficit by $40 billion  this year and $500 billion over  the  period of 5 years. Now that is about  the best we could do. Let me respond,  then I am going to sit down. That is  about the best we can do. That was  discussed  at  the  beginning  of  the  summit. And if anybody wanted to cut  it $1  trillion,  it was felt  that would  push  this country off  the precipice  into a recession or even a depression.  So that was the figure that was de cided upon as being prudent and real istic and efficacious. And that is what  we are striving to do here. That is a  pretty good-sized step. And if we live  up to our part of the agreement, we  hope to achieve it and, if something  happens beyond our control, then we  will be held harmless on appropria tions.  ",1990
1676,1186,21,Mr. GRAHAM.," It seems to me that  puts a  tremendous amount of obliga tion on us to have confidence that the  economic assumptions upon which we  are entering this are realistic to con servative. That is, if we start with eco nomic assumptions that f..re unlikely  to be realized, then we have a suspi cion we are going into this transaction  but the results are not going to be as  they appear on page 3.  What are the economic assumptions  upon which the maximum deficit re ductions for the 3 years that we are  about to enter are predicated?  ",1990
1677,1186,21,Mr. BYRD., That falls a little out of  my purview.  ,1990
1678,1186,21,Mr. SASSER.," As I indicated earlier,  I  think, in response to a question of  the Senator from Louisiana,  for  the  first 3 years, the Gramm-Rudman-Hol lings targets are merely advisory. We  are not seeking to hit those targets at  all. All we are seeking to do and all we  pledge to do under this agreement is  simply to reduce the deficit by a set  amount over 3 years.  If the economy declines precipitious ly or falls out from under us, we are  still just obligated to reduce the deficit  by  those set amounts over 3 years.  Clearly, if there is a severe economic  downturn,  then all bets are off and  there has to be some sort of change in  policy emanating from the executive  branch in conjunction with the legisla tive branch.  ",1990
1679,1186,21,Mr. GRAHAM.," Let me ask the ques tion a little different way. Are the eco nomic assumptions upon which these  maximum deficit targets, are they the  same economic assumptions that 0MB  utilized in its-",1990
1680,1186,21,Mr. SASSER.," If I could  interrupt  the Senator, I think I could shorten it.  The economic assumptions on which  these deficit numbers are grounded in  this budget agreement are based on  the latest CBO economic assumptions.  And that would be as late as June. We  have not received any new CBO eco nomic  assumptions  since  then,  al though we expect some in the not too  distant future. These deficit numbers  are not based on the 0MB economic  assumptions that some were criticizing  a few weeks ago.  ",1990
1681,1186,21,Mr. GRAHAM., Does the staff in the  committee have a set of those CBO  economic assumptions?  ,1990
1682,1186,21,Mr. SASSER., I am sure they could  be furnished to the Senator; yes.  ,1990
1683,1186,21,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I  thank  all Senators for their attention. I will  shortly yield. I thank those who asked  questions.  I  thank  the distinguished  majority  leader  and  Republican  leader. I thank all other Senators who  have been very patient.  I feel we have gone some distance in  attempting  to allay  the concerns of  the Senators.  I  think Senators who  have listened to this debate, although  I would not give it much of anything  like 75 percent or above a grade C in  my responses, at least I think they feel  that  I  share  their  frustrations and  their concerns, and perhaps they may  be a little bit overly excited. All this is  not going to Hades in a handbasket if  I can help it.  What we have done, I think we have  protected the legislative branch, pro tected  the  appropriations  process.  There has not been any shift of power  to the executive branch from the legis lative here. We simply have an agree ment and we are attempting to enforce  it. That requires some discipline on  our part.  In the final analysis, we hope that  this will redound to the good interests  of the American people. There will not  be an opportunity to debate the point  of order. There will not be an opportu nity to debate the waiver of the point  of order.  I would like, while I retain the floor,  to yield to the majority leader if he  has something to say.  ",1990
1684,1186,21,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President,  I  thank the distinguished President pro  tempore and chairman of the Appro priations Committee for what I think  has been a most informative discussion  here this evening. I, who sat through  much of the budget summit process,  learned a great deal  from  it and  I  know that all the other Senators did. I  also  thank him for  the  tremendous  effort he put into the preparation of  this agreement, as he puts it very suc cinctly, a way  to enforce an agree ment.  It is my hope, Mr. President, that we  can now bring this to a conclusion. I  hope that every Senator feels he or  she has had ample opportunity to ex press his or her views, ask questions,  and understand it. There comes a time  when we simply have to take action  and complete that action. I hope we  can do that shortly, I say to the chair man.  I  hope  all Members  of  the  Senate are prepared to vote. I know  the distinguished Senator from North  Carolina is prepared to make a point  of order, and I understand the chair man will move to waive that point of  order.  I urge my colleagues to join us in the  motion  to waive  the point of order.  This is an essential part of this agree ment. This is a deficit reduction pack age which includes reduction over a 5year period, and this is the means by  which we attempt to ensure that the  reduction will  occur  over  a  5-year  period. Obviously, no one of us can  fully foresee with great precision what  is going to occur next year, let alone 5  ",1990
1685,1199,21,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, I voted to  waive the Budget Act to permit consid eration of the amendment to the rec onciliation bill offered by the Senator  from Tennessee, Senator GORE  and  the Senator from Maryland, Senator  MIKULSKI.  The amendment would make signifi cant improvements in the fairness of  the tax package included in the deficit  reduction plan, by reducing  the  tax  burden on the elderly and on the aver age taxpayer and increasing the share  of deficit reduction costs to be borne  by wealthier taxpayers. It is for that  reason that I support the amendment.  I  should note, however,  that even  with  the Gore-Mikulski  amendment  there would remain serious problems,  including a gasoline tax increase even  though it would be smaller as a result  of the Gore-Mikulski amendment. For  this reason I reserve final judgment on  approval of the overall budget plan.  ACCELERATED DEATH BENEFITS FOR THE  TERMINALLY ILL  ",1990
1686,1199,21,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President,  many victims of terminal' illness suffer  not only from the disease  itself, but  from the overwhelming economic con sequences of their condition. AIDS pa tients and those stricken with cancer  often lose their jobs. Their health care  costs mount. They can't pay  their  rent. Some become homeless or are  forced to forgo life-sustaining or life improving care. The tragedy of their  illness is compounded by the tragedy  of economic ruin.  personal and therefore nondeductible purpose. This  rationale has no relevance in the corporate context,  since corporations generally make only business ex penditures, and since  there  is no distinction be tween personal and other types of corporate inter est deductions.  In the past year many life insurance  companies have been offering people  an advance on their death benefits in  the  event of  a  terminal  illness  to  ensure that they will have funds avail able  to pay health care costs, mort gage payments,  living expenses, and,  in general, allow  them  to  live  their  final months with dignity and as com fortably as possible.  Insurance com missioners in 43 States have now ap proved  the  addition  of  accelerated  death benefits to life insurance poli cies, thereby providing the terminally  ill with critical financial resources in  their final months.  While death benefits are excluded  from  income  tax under current law,  the law needs to be clarified with re spect to the payment of accelerated  death benefits to the terminally ill. In  addition, because the right to receive  accelerated death benefits does not  significantly  alter  the  fundamental  terms or economics of the policy, clari fication is needed that the addition of  the accelerated death benefit provi sion, at no cost, will not cause the poli cies to fail to be treated as life insur ance policies for tax purposes.  Mr. President, I understand that the  procedures  surrounding  this budget  reconciliation bill have precluded the  consideration of  the clarification of  this tax issue which  is  important to  thousands  of  terminally  ill  people  throughout the country. I would ask  the chairman of the Finance Commit tee, Mr. BENTSEN,  if, at the earliest  possible date, his committee could con sider this needed and worthwhile tax  clarification.  ",1990
1687,1199,21,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, I am  aware of the accelerated death bene fits  issue and of  its  importance for  those Americans affected. Let me say  to the Senator from Connecticut that  I applaud his efforts in helping the  terminally ill and I assure him that I  will look closely at this issue as soon as  possible in the next Congress.  THE DAC PERCENTAGES  ",1990
1688,1199,21,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, a great  deal of concern has been expressed by  the Members of  this Chamber over  the $8 billion to be raised from the life  insurance industry and its millions of  policyholders  through  the  so-called  DAC proposal. A number of our col leagues are concerned that an increase  in the tax of up to 50 percent on some  companies  is  excessive,  and might  threaten the financial vitality of some  of those companies.  As you know, at least 13 members of  the Committee on Finance were pre pared to offer an amendment during  committee deliberations to lower the  applicable DAC percentages. Unfortu nately, our ability to act on this impor tant issue was affected by our inability  to receive official revenue estimates on  certain compliance measures.  ",1990
1689,1212,21,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, after a  great deal of considerati.on, I have de cided not to support this budget pack age. While it is clear that major deficit  reduction is long overdue, I have many  concerns  about  the  course  that  is  charted by this particular piece of leg islation.  While  this package  is better  than  the one put forward by the summit ters, I am still very concerned that it  will place an undue burden on middle and low-income Americans and on our  senior citizens. The  increase  in  the  Medicare  deductible would  be  the  equivalent of a 20-percent cut in the  COLA for an average older person on  Social Security. The  increase  in the  gas tax hits hard at the average work ing person at a time when they have  already seen huge  increases  in  the  amount they must pay for gasoline. It  asks less of a sacrifice from those with  high incomes than it does of those of  more modest means. In short, it is not  the direction  I  think we  should be  heading in.  I am particularly concerned about  continuing  efforts  to  jury-rig  the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings approach to  budgeting. This system, which has al ready been adjusted once, has failed to  bring about a  balanced budget.  In stead, it has led to many successful ef forts  to  find ways around  its con straints, and to mask the true nature  of the budget problems we face. The  proposal we have before us creates a  whole new maze of across-the-board  cuts-a budgetary approach most of us  said should never be implemented be cause it cuts good programs and bad  ones indiscriminately-and provides a  whole new set of  incentives  to  find  clever ways to avoid facing our budget ary problems head-on.  It is clear that we must move for ward to enact a budget. The proposal  advanced by the House of Represeuta tives is a major improvement over this  bill. It reduces the cost to senior citi zens, cuts the gas tax, and extends a  more fair share of the overall cost of  reducing the deficit to those who are  able to pay. I would strongly urge the  conferees on  this package  to move  toward the House package. Until we  make  substantial  improvements,  I  cannot in good faith support the pack age that we have in front of us today.  ",1990
1690,1212,21,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I rise to  express my support for the fiscal year  1991  omnibus  budget  reconciliation  resolution.  The reconciliation resolution is  im perfect-but an  improvement on the  budget summit agreement of October  7. The solid deficit reduction it pro vides, the clarification of government  priorities,  and  the  fairness  of  the  burden sharing more  than outweigh  its flaws.  The resolution preserves the overall  summit agreement on deficit  reduc tion. It is the largest deficit reduction  package ever considered by the Con gress,  including deficit  reduction of  some $40 billion in fiscal year 1991 and  $500  billion  over  fiscal  years  1991  through 1995.  Mr. President,  the budget clock  is  ticking. At the present time, we face a  crisis-a crisis in Government, a crisis  in the economy, and a crisis in confi dence in the institution of government  itself.  Our Government  is paralyzed, and  across this country American citizens  are outraged. Rightfully so.  If this were a European parliament,  the government already would have  resigned in disgrace.  America  is  saying,  ""Enough  al ready."" After  10  years  of  debate,  phony budgets, soaring deficits, and  political indulgence,  the Government  is imploding.  It  Our country must have a national  budget, which means  compromises  must be made. If we don't enact a rec onciliation bill, the growing deficit and  the ongoing paralysis in budgetmaking  will continue to erode our ability to  govern.  Once and for all, we must begin eras ing  the  Federal  deficit  that  has  plagued this country for the past 10  years. Now  is  the  time  to end  this  fiscal insanity.  Mr. President, this is a fair and bal anced package.  is  a  compromise  package. It represents tough choices.  It will involve some sacrifice. But it is  real and it is right.  As I said earlier, it is not a perfect  reconciliation bill. But in my 16 years  in the Congress, I have yet to see the  perfect budget plan. Every Senator  who wants to vote against it can say it  does not do something exactly the way  that Senator would like to see it done.  This budget plan isn't perfect to this  Senator either. But it is a real begin ning toward serious deficit reduction.  This budget will help us address the  problems of the next century and put  our Nation back on track. This budget  truly  is  about our Nation's future:  Without  a  solution  to our budget  crisis, we will continue mortgaging our  children's future.  Mr. President, a budget is not simply  an accounting document; it should re flect the priorities for our Nation.  We not only need to have the deficit  reduced-we also must  invest in the  next generation.  In that regard, I would like to high light a few of the improvements that  have  occurred  since  the  budget  summit agreement. I am particularly  delighted that the bill incorporates a  two-part approach  to Federal assist ance to meet the child-care needs of  millions  of  families  across  the  Nation-a grant program  to States  fashioned by  the Labor Committee  and an expansion of tax credits devel oped by the Finance Committee.  As my colleagues know, a great deal  of time, energy, and deliberation have  gone into developing child care legisla tion. During  the  1988  Presidential  campaign, George Bush announced his  support  for  child  care.  Everyone  agreed that we needed child care legis lation-but we  lacked consensus on  what that legislation should look like.  On June 23, 1989-15 months ago-the  Senate passed S. 5, the ABC bill, after  8 days of heated debate. Subsequently,  the House passed its version of child  care  legislation, and since  that  time  the Senate, the House and the admin istration have debated the best way to  meet  the  child-care  needs  of  the  Nation.  Over the weekend, with the encour agement of the distinguished majority  leader, for the first time we reached  agreement on a new and expanded  ",1990
1691,1381,21,Mr.  SARBANES.," Mr.  President,  today I am introducing together with  my colleagues from Maryland, Virgin ia,  and Pennsylvania-Senators MI KULSKI, WARNER,  ROBB, HEINZ,  and  SPECTER-legislation  to  reauthorize  and enhance the Chesapeake Bay Pro gram. This  legislation,  entitled  the  Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act of  1990, not only continues the tremen dously successful program authorized  in  the 1987 Water Quality Act, but  provides  for  an  expansion  and  strengthening of  the cooperative ef forts to restore and protect the Chesa peake Bay. An identical bill is being in troduced today in the House.  Why is this legislation needed? For  two reasons. First, the existing author ization for the Chesapeake Bay Pro gram, along with other Water Quality  Act programs, expired on September  30, at the end of fiscal year 1990. The  program along with other Water Qual ity Act programs are being continued  through authorities and  funding  in  the appropriations process. However,  there is still much work that needs to  be done on the bay and the need for a  new authorization is clear and compel ling. Second, with the signing of the  Chesapeake Bay agreement in Decem ber 1987,  the bay area  jurisdictions  and the Federal Government commit ted  to  an  ambitious  program  to  achieve  improved water quality and  living resources productivity. The bay  area States have moved  swiftly  to  enact legislation and dedicate funding  to meet their commitments under the  agreement. In order to assure effective  implementation of  the pact at  the  Federal level, it is essential that new  authorities and resources be provided.  The Chesapeake Bay Restoration  Act provides those new authorities and  additional resources. It authorizes $20  million a year for the next 4 years for  the Chesapeake Bay Program-an in crease of $7 million over the previous ly authorized level. It establishes new  initiatives to address key issues such  as toxic pollution, the decline of the  bay's living resources, and population  growth and land use. This legislation  reauthorizes the programs established  in the 1987 Water Quality Act-a $3  million authorization for EPA to ad minister the program and a $10 mil lion authorization  for grants  to  the  bay area States which has been used  primarily for nonpoint source reduc tion efforts. In addition,  this legisla tion authorizes the resources and guid ance for the Federal agencies neces sary to begin implementing the strate gies called  for under  the 1987 bay  agreement.  The legislation was carefully crafted  over the past 7 months with the assist ance of  the bay area States-Mary land, Pennsylvania, and Virginia-and  the District of Columbia, the Chesa peake Bay Commission,  the Citizens  Advisory Committee,  the  Scientific  and Technical Advisory Committee,  the Local Government Advisory Com mittee,  the Alliance  for  the Chesa peake Bay, the Chesapeake Bay Foun dation, the bay area congressional del egation, and many others. It repre sents a consensus on the highest prior ity needs as identified by the agencies  ",1990

1694,1420,21,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, on Oc tober  24  in  the  capital of Rhode  Island, a gala celebration will mark  the 80 continuous years of service of  the First Providence Boy Scout Troop.  I would like to salute today the 20 men  who have served as Scoutmaster to the  troop,  the 16 men who attained the  honored rank of Eagle Scout under  their leadership, and the hundreds of  parents,  friends,  and  fell ow Scouts  who have made possible  the  troop's  achievements throughout its remarka ble history.  The First Providence Troop was or ganized in 1910 and listed 64 Scouts in  its first charter. Five troops comprised  the Rhode Island Boy Scouts in that  year and all were on the steps of the  state house when their flags were pre sented to the wife of the Governor on  May 23, 1911. During that summer,  the  first  summer camp devoted  to  Scouting was  in operation on Pru dence Island in Narragansett Bay. A  source of great excitement  for  the  boys was the transmission, while they  were there, of the first wireless mes sage ever dispatched from the island.  The  approach  of World War  1  brought national  recognition  to  the  Boy Scouts of our country, and  the  chartering of the organization as the  Boy Scouts of America by Congress  was accomplished on June 15, 1916. A  year  later,  the Rhode  Island Boy  Scouts, including the First Providence  Troop, voted to merge and become the  Greater  Providence  Council,  Boy  Scouts of America.  The fundamental purpose of Scout ing is       to  promote,  through  organization  and cooperation with other agencies,  the  ability of boys to do things for themselves  and others, to train them in Scoutcraft, and  to teach them patriotism, courage, self reli ance and kindred virtues, with emphasis on  the Scout Oath:  On my honor I will do my best to do my  duty to God and my country and to obey  the Scout Law; to help other people at all  times,  to keep myself physically  strong,  mentally awake and morally straight.  These  are  the precepts  the First  Providence  Troop,  Boy  Scouts  of  America has held fast, and has trans lated into action through 80 wonderful  years. Many are the men, women, and  children of Providence who could rise  up in thanks to th(; Scouts for their  many gifts of food and clothing and  the countless acts of community serv ice.  The leaders of the troop can be jus tificably proud, for the result of their  selfless  devotion  to  the  youth  of  Rhode  Island has been  a  host  of  ""strong, mentally awake and morally  straight"" men.  Today  the  troop's  membership reflects a cross-section of  the diverse population of my State many of its members are newcomers to  the United States-and  in  scouting,  they  are  enthusiastically  learning  good  citizenship  and duty  to  their  fell ow Americans.  We  join with  the First Providence  Troop in the hope that its thousands  of alumni and  friends will guide  it  toward the year 2010, when it may cel ebrate a century of Scouting.e  JOHN HOUTARI'S TRIBUTE TO  THE  INTERNATIONAL  SPACE  YEAR IN 1992  e ",1990
1695,1420,21,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. Presi dent, in 1985, the Congress first pro posed that 1992 be declared the Inter national Space Year, commemorating  the 500th anniversary of Columbus'  voyage to the New World and the 35th  anniversary of the International Geo physical Year that started the space  age. Our dear friend, the late Senator  Spark Matsunaga,  introduced  the  International Space Year  resolution  during  the 100th Congress,  and on  July 31, 1990, this proposal was finally  approved.  A major focus of the International  Space Year is global participation in  space exploration. Poets such as T.S.  Elliot have commented on the human  drive to explore:  We shall not cease from exploration  . And the end of all our exploring  Will be to arrive where we started  And know the place for the first time.  I am certain that space exploration  will teach us a great deal about our selves, and I am pleased that Congress  has taken this step to foster worldwide  support for space activities in 1992.  I am particularly proud of a constit uent of mine, John Houtari of Zim merman, MN, who has put his consid erable energy and talents into promot ing the International Space Year. Mr.  Houtari has composed a poem, ""First  Steps,""  that  represents  the  finest  goals of cooperative space activities. I  encourage my colleagues  to consider  this poem as the theme of the Interna tional Space Year. ""First Steps,"" is an  eloquent and fitting tribute to human  efforts to reach beyond the boundaries  of our planet.  Mr. President, I ask that Mr. Hou tari's poem, ""First Steps"" be entered  at this point in the RECORD.  The poem follows:  FIRST STEPS  (by John Huotari)  A shrine beneath a vivid sky  As sharp as broken glass,  Stands silent on a sunlit shore  Immune to seasons' change,  And footprints in its shadow lie,  All 'round its gleaming mass,  Imprinted there forever more,  Where none would think it strange.  Where wave will never wash away,  Where wind will never blow,  A precious jewel of history  Beyond our reverent reach,  So that our children's children may  Look back on us, and know  Our hungering for mystery,  Our legacy to each.  First footsteps in a brand new land  Too vast to comprehend,  Impressed in soil and soul, our claim  Recorded and enshrined,  And writ that all may understand,  Upon the altar's end,  These ringing words of hope: ""We came  In peace for all Mankind.""  This symbol on a blazing plain,  Beneath a crescent Earth,  A guiding beacon shall become  To every human mind.  And when we need no more remain  Upon our world of birth,  We'll say to those we meet: 'We come  In peace to All we find.'e  CIRCLES OF POISON   ",1990

1706,1446,21,Mr. BALLENGER.," Mr. Speaker, at  this time of economic anguish here in  the United States, on the verge of a re cession, the worst thing we can do is  raise taxes. Your reconciliation pack age  includes $93.6 billion  in  tax  in creases that will shrink credit, raise in terest rates, and guarantee recession.  With  layoffs occurring everywhere  in the United States, you would think  this sacrifice asked of the American  people would be supported by a de crease in the size of the Federal Gov ernment. With our troops in the field,  the only cuts in the Democrat package  are in defense. The rest of the Govern ment continues to grow.  This  is  obviously  the opposite of  what  the American voter wants.  I  hope the voters recognize this before  the election and before the depths of  the recession created by this package.  THE RIGHT THING TO DO ON  THE BUDGET  (Mr. HUTTO asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute, and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1990
1707,1446,21,Mr. HUTTO.," Mr. Speaker, there is  much frustration throughout America  and there is much frustration here in  the Congress. We must get a budget.  We started the process night before  last, I think, with a good budget reso lution.  When many of us voted against the  resolution a week or so ago, and  it  went down overwhelmingly with votes  on both sides of the aisle, two of the  major points for voting against it were  the hard hits on Medicare and our  senior citizens, and also the onerous 10  cents a gallon on gasoline. We correct ed that in the budget resolution which  passed this House of Representatives  night before last.  It appears that the other body does  not want  to do anything about  the  bubble and taxing the higher income  and wealthier Americans.  I  think most people feel that it is  the right thing to do, to have an equi table distribution of this burden; so I  hope that before we go home, that we  will have done the right thing for all  our constituents and place this burden  where  it belongs. None of us  likes  taxes, but we need to place it in the  right places, and I believe this House  has taken the right step in doing that.  I  hope  the other body will  follow  through.  HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD  STAND TALL  (Mr. HEFLEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute, and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1990
1708,1446,21,Mr. HEFLEY.," Mr. Speaker, there is  a  lot of finger pointing that goes on  around here about who wants more  taxes. Let us look at reality for just a  moment.  Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the  Constitution states ""All bills for rais ing  revenue  shall originate  in  the  House of Representatives,"" the same  body  controlled by  the Democratic  Party for the past 36 years.  When  the President  called  for  a  budget summit this year,  it was  the  Democratic leadership that demanded  additional  taxes be considered as  a  condition of their participation;  Chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee, DAN ROSTENKOW SKI, has stated that raising income and  excise taxes was the best solution he  could find to balancing the budget;  Senator HOLLINGS, chairman of the  Senate  Commerce  Committee,  has  called for instituting a 5-percent value  added tax as a means of balancing the  budget and getting our economy back  on the right track; and  ToM FOLEY, Speaker of the House,  and GEORGE MITCHELL, majority leader  of  the Senate, have  repeatedly and  strongly endorsed raising taxes.  Apparently, congressional leadership  has an obsession with increasing taxes.  When they speak of tightening belts,  making the tough choices, and show ing political courage, they are not talk ing about cutting spending, they are  talking about raising taxes. We need  to remind them that it does not take  courage  to  spend  someone  else's  money.  Earlier this summer, I cosponsored  the Armey no new  taxes  resolution  that was overwhelmingly adopted by  my Republican colleagues. In that res olution, we promised  to oppose any  tax increase, regardless of what form  it took and regardless of how many  concessions we  received  in return.  I  intend to keep that promise, and I call  on the rest of my colleagues to do the  same.  THE CIVIL RIGHTS BILL AND  QUOTAS  (Mr. WASHINGTON asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute, and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1990
1709,1446,21,Mr. WASHINGTON.," Mr. Speaker,  this morning  the President has  the  civil  rights bill on his desk. Under  American  law,  there  is  a  universal  standard. Whomever claims something  to be true must prove that thing to be  true, not claim it, prove it. If the civil  rights bill is a quota bill, then why do  not those who claim it is a quota bill  prove that it is a quota bill and stop  hiding behind that?  If there is a veto of this bill, I think  the President, Mr. Speaker,  should  send a clear message to the American  people. It would only  take  three or  four  sentences  to  explain how  and  under what circumstances  this won derful bill is a quota bill. In plain Eng lish, they ought to be able to prove it.  Mr. Thornburgh and Mr. Gray have  between them, Mr. Speaker, 61 years  of experience in practicing law. Surely  they can come up with more than con clusions  that  this  is  a  quota  bill.  Surely they can come up with three or  four sentences, Mr. Speaker.  They are giving the President bad  legal advice. There is no in between.  There is no crying wolf.  The President has said, Mr. Speaker,  that we should read his lips. He said  he wants  to sign a civil  rights bill.  There is only one man in the mirror,  Mr. Speaker. His mouth moves so fast  . I cannot hear him, but I can see what  he does, and what his actions do say  that he does not want a civil rights  bill,  and what  he  does  speaks  so  loudly, Mr. Speaker,  I  cannot hear  what he says.  CORRECTING THE SYNAR  AMENDMENT ON GRAZING  (Mr. RHODES asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute, and to revise and extend his  remarks.)   ",1990
1710,1446,21,Mr. RHODES.," Mr. Speaker, I hope  the Chair and the House do not mind  if I change the subject for at least a  brief moment.  On Monday  the House considered  the Synar amendment which affected  grazing fees charged to graze cattle on  BLM lands. I think many Members of  this House based their vote on repre sentations of fact  that were  inaccu rate. Among the things that the gen tleman from Oklahoma [Mr. SYNAR]  used to press his argument were fig ures relating to grazing fees charged  by States to allow grazing on State owned  lands, and among  the States  the gentleman quoted was the State of  Arizona, where he said the State of  Arizona charges $5.99 per animal unit  month to graze on State lands.  Mr. Speaker, I am today inserting in  the RECORD a letter from the commis sioner of the Arizona State Land De partment which states that in fact in  1990  the  fee  charged  is  $1.39  per  animal unit month, and the highest  fee ever charged since 1950 was $1.43.  I do not think the gentleman from  Oklahoma  [Mr.  SYNAR]  deliberately  ",1990
1711,1459,21,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 1 V2 minutes  to  the gentleman  from Oregon [Mr. AUCOIN].  Mr. AuCOIN. I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I urge the defeat of  the Solomon resolution. We can never  as Americans forgive the atrocities of  Tiananmen Square, but we serve no  constructive  purpose  today,  my  friends,  by  passing  the  Solomon  amendment.  This  resolution would hurt  those  who have the greatest stake in United  States-China relations, the individuals  and the businesses in southern China,  which are the most reform-minded in  that  country.  There  are  reform  minded peoples who yearn for a better  day, and I think we do them no service  by playing into the hands of the hard  liners,  and  I  think  the  Solomon  amendment unwittingly would.  Second,  the gentleman  from New  York has made a very good point, and  I want to repeat it for Members today,  as someone who led the first Members  from the House on a trade mission to  China in 1979. The point the gentle man from New York made was simply  this: if you look at what has happened  in Eastern Europe, it was those coun tries who had  the closest economic  link with the United States that were  first to throw off communism and to talitarian rule. You cannot introduce  free market economics without liberal izing the political system of a country.  Europe has taught us that; 1989 was a  lesson in history on this point, and we  will be breaking that lesson of history  if we cut off relations with China in  this way. Do not use  this chopping  block. Do not take this step. Def eat  the Solomon amendment.  D 1150  ",1990
1712,1459,21,Mr. RUSSO.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman  from Illinois [Mr. Russo] is recognized  for up to 3 minutes.  ",1990
1713,1459,21,Mr. RUSSO.," Mr. Chairman, China  does not deserve MFN status because  of  its  restrictive emigration policies.  Asia Watch and Amnesty Internation al have both said that its emigration  policy has become even more restric tive since  the massacre last year at  Tiananmen Square.  The Chinese Constitution does not  guarantee freedom of emigration. It is  ironic  that  this  administration has  asked the Soviet Union to codify an  emigration  law before  it  is granted  MFN  status. What does Gorbachev  have to do to get MFN status, massa cre his own citizens in Red Square like  the Chinese did?  That is wrong. That is wrong.  To  this day  the Chinese Govern ment continues  to carry out secret  executions  of  political  prisoners.  There are 10,000 or more political pris oners now being held in Chinese jails.  There are numerous procedural and  monetary barriers to the emigration of  Chinese students and other groups.  One requirement, a so-called cultiva tion fee, would require students to pay  the equivalent of 8 years of pay  in  order to go abroad for self-financed  graduate studies. That is how much  they want their students to emigrate  to the Western World.  My colleagues, religious persecution  continues. Buddhist monks and nuns  are being imprisoned and expelled.  China uses the 20 million prisoners  in its  jails to provide forced, unpaid  labor to Chinese businesses, and some  of  the  fruits  of  their  labor  reach  American ports.  By supporting this corrupt regime in  Beijing we  tacitly endorse this prac tice.  I ask my colleagues to vote in favor  of this resolution of disapproval, and I  commend my good friends, the gentle lady from California [Ms. PELOSI], the  gentleman from New York [Mr. SOLO MON], and the gentleman from Massa chusetts [Mr. MARKEY]  for a job well  done.  Mr. Chairman, I yield whatever time  I  have  left  to  the gentleman  from  Massachusetts [Mr. MARKEY].  The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman  from Massachusetts [Mr. MARKEY]  is  recognized for 1 minute.  ",1990
1714,1459,21,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Chairman,  thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  let me make  this  point: The  Jackson-Vanik  provision  worked in the Soviet Union. It contrib uted mightily to bringing the Soviet  economy to its knees and its political  system to its senses.  Even  today  in China  they occupy  the  country  of  Tibet,  committing  atrocities  that  far  exceed  anything  that the Soviet Union ever did in Lith uania. Even today the Chinese are still  engaging in relations with the Iraqis,  helping them in their chemical weap ons program. We cannot allow that to  continue. They have had an ongoing  program  of  cooperation with  the  Iraqis in the development of the Is lamic nuclear bomb which could be  used against all civilization, the Israe lis and the American soldiers.  As  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  pointed out,  they have continued to  repress their country, executing over  500 people just in the last year for po litical purposes.  This is not liberal-conservative, it is  not Democratic-Republican. The gen tleman from New York [Mr. SOLOMON]  is correct, and he should deserve and  receive our support on the floor today.  ",1990
1715,1459,21,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  intend to close on our side and I re serve the balance of my time to close  debate.  ",1990
1716,1459,21,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield such time as he may consume to  I  ",1990
1717,1472,21,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to  join  the gentlewoman from New York [Ms.  SLAUGHTER]  in supporting  this  rule.  We have before us a modified open  rule which, in my view, is slanted more  toward  open,  rather  than  toward  modified; and, more than that,  it  is  agreed to by the leadership on both  sides of the aisle, and that is the way  it should be if we are going to have  any kind of modification or anything  other than a  fully open rule. It will  make in order consideration of all four  amendments to  this bill which were  presented to the Committee on Rules  by both Democratic and Republican .  Members. Mr. Speaker, the House just  passed my  resolution which  disap proves most-favored-nation status for  China, and, should that bill for some  reason not make it through the Senate  or be vetoed by  the President,  this  kind of legislation, H.R. 4939, is badly  needed.  Mr. Speaker, this bill would make re newal of China's most-favored-nation  trade  status  next  July  conditional  upon  improvements by  the Govern ment of China in its respect and pro tection for the basic human rights of  its people. Many of us feel that the  conditions set forth in H.R. 4939 are  not strong enough, and, accordingly,  four Members  will  be  presenting  amendments to this bill.  The gentlewoman  from California  [Ms. PELOSI], who was so active on the  previous bill that just passed, has pro posed a tougher set of conditions over all, and the gentleman from Virginia  [Mr. WOLF] has proposed adding the  issue of religious freedom to those con ditions,  something which  is  terribly  important. In addition, the gentleman  from  Illinois  [Mr.  PORTER]  has  an  amendment concerning the future of  Hong Kong and the need to respect  the essential human rights of the 51/2  million citizens of Hong Kong. Finally,  the gentleman from Washington [Mr.  MILLER]  has an  interesting  amend ment setting forth some guidelines for  conduct by American businesses oper ating in China today.  The rule makes  in order consider ation of all four of those amendments.  I commend all four of the Members  for their amendments. They are good  amendments,  and  adoption  of  the  amendments will certainly make the  bill something we can all support.  I also thank the Committee on Rules  and the leadership of the House for  opening up the process on this particu lar bill. Nobody is being gagged on this  very, very important subject. We have  four well-reasoned  and worthwhile  amendments to vote on.  So, I strongly support this rule, and  I see no reason for a recorded vote.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York. Mr.  Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I  yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California [Ms. PELOSI].  ",1990
1718,1472,21,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentlewoman from New York [Ms.  SLAUGHTER] for yielding.  I, too, want to add my support for  the rule and commend the Committee  on Rules for their sensitivity on this  issue of  importance  to Members of  Congress. Because of the hard work of  the Committee on Rules we are able  today  to  bring  to  the  floor  four  amendments which I believe will be a  vast  improvement  to  the Pease bill.  The Committee on Ways and Means  worked very hard on the Pease legisla tion. I  think it is good legislation.  I  think it could be better, and those of  us who are not members of the Com mittee on Ways and Means will be  today given our opportunity to present  some additional strengthening amend ments to the Pease bill.  Mr. Speaker, I  think, when that is  accomplished and the House of Repre sentatives  votes  overwhelmingly  in  favor of the Pease bill, we will, in addi tion to the statement that was made  earlier today, be sending forth a very  good package of two options to be con sidered in our trade policy with China.  I know the rule is not controversial.  I do not want to take up any more of  the House's time, but I do thank the  committee again, as  far as my own  amendment  is concerned, and also  I  commend the good work of the gentle man from Virginia [Mr. WOLFE],  the  gentleman from Illinois [Mr. PORTER]  and the gentleman from Washington  [Mr. MILLER] in crafting their amend ments to this bill which I believe will  make a big improvement to it.  Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York. Mr.  Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time.  ",1990
1719,1472,21,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  back the balance of my time.  Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York. Mr.  Speaker, I move the previous question  on the resolution.  The previous question was ordered.  The resolution was agreed to.  A motion to reconsider was laid on  the table.  The SPEAKER pro  tempore <Mr.  MAZZOLI). Pursuant to House Resolu tion 503 and rule XXIII, the Chair de clares the House in the Committee of  the Whole House on the State of the  Union for the consideration of the bill,  H.R. 4939.  D 1251  IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  Accordingly  the  House  resolved  itself  into  the Committee  of  the  Whole House on  the State of  the  Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 4939) regarding the extension of  most-favored-nation treatment to the  products of the People's Republic of  China, and for other purposes, with  Mrs. BYRON in the chair.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the  rule, the bill is considered as having  been read the first time.  Under the rule, the gentleman from  Illinois  [Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI] will be  recognized for 1 hour, and the gentle man from Minnesota  [Mr. FRENZEL]  will be recognized for 1 hour. The ma jority time will be under the control of  the gentleman from Florida [Mr. GIB BONS].  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Florida [Mr. GIBBONS].  ",1990
1720,1472,21,Mr. GIBBONS.," Madam Chairman, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Madam Chairman, this is essentially  a replay of the last vote we had. This  is just a little different. Let me try to  explain the difference.  This bill, if it becomes law, will put  additional burdens upon the President  in granting MFN to China next year,  not this year.  In  the Committee  on Ways  and  Means  and  the  Subcommittee  on  Trade, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.  PEASE], a very distinguished member  of our committee, took it upon himself  working with others on the committee  to draft what he thought was a sensi ble  imposition of additional human  rights requirements upon the Govern ment of China.  The administration worked with us,  expressing concern all the time about  making this bill so tough that no one  could comply with it.  There are  some  real problems  in  China. All Members  know  that.  I  thought when we wrote the Pease bill,  adopted  it as a  committee bill and  brought it to the floor, that perhaps  we had reached an agreement with the  President that he would sign the bill.  Now,  all Members who have been  around here any time know how every  President plays his power. He does not  tell you point blank yes or point blank  no. He prefers  to play his cards as  they come to him.  When I appeared before the Com mittee on Rules seeking a rule fur this  bill,  I had  received, and so had all  Members of the Congress received, a  statement  from  the White House  about this bill.  As  in all statements you get from  the White House on subjects like this,  you get a rather ambiguous statement.  But this statement was very clear in  one point.  It said  if  this bill were  ",1990
1721,1485,21,Mr. GIBBONS.," Madam Chairman, I  yield 3 minutes  to  the very distin guished gentleman  from New York  [Mr. WEISS].  (Mr. WEISS asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1990
1722,1485,21,Mr. WEISS.," Madam Chairman, I rise  today in support of this legislation to  ensure that the Chinese Government  has met certain human rights condi tions before MFN trade benefits may  be renewed next year.  The leaders of China are quietly at tempting to spruce up their nation's  tarnished image. Only 15 months have  passed since they ordered the massa cre of hundreds of demonstrators in  Beijing, yet they are actively courting  international approval. They are coop erating with the United States in the  Persian Gulf and Cambodia and, just a  few weeks ago, they played host to the  Asian Games in Beijing.  We  may  commend  these  steps  toward reconciliation with the interna tional community, but we must not  forget the human rights tragedy that  continues to unfold in China and the  brave young people  sympbolized by  the picture of the man in front of the  tanks.  The  Chinese  leadership  has  launched a nation-wide anticrime cam paign  to stem political unrest, and  Chinese prisoners are being executed  by the hundreds without adequate ju dicial procedures.  The human rights organization Asia  Watch estimates that as many as 1,000  people remain in prison in China for  political and religious activities. The  vast majority of  these prisoners are  being held without proper charges or  trials. Most have been detained  for  nothing more than peaceful political  expression.  The fate of these prisoners remains  shrouded in secrecy. The Chinese Gov ernment claims that 881 people have  been  released since January of  this  year, yet the names of these prisoners  have not been released.  Representative JOHN MILLER and I  have initiated a congressional project  in conjunction with Asia Watch  to  support these prisoners of conscience  in China. The Chinese Political Pris oner Adoption Program is designed to  ensure that the courageous men and  women who  remain  imprisoned  for  their outspoken defense of  freedom  are not forgotten here in the United  States.  So far, we have had an impressive re sponse. Over  70 Members  of  the  House-both Democrats and Republi cans-are already participating in the  program. But with so many still im prisoned in China, there is much work  to be done. For those of our colleagues  who  are  not  yet  involved  in  the  project, we invite you to join us.  We must let  the Chinese Govern ment know that we have not forgot ten-and will not forget-the coura geous people who continue to suffer  because of their commitment to demo cratic reform in China.  I rise today in strong support of the  Pease legislation, and also of the ef forts of several of our colleagues  to  make  improvements  in  the  bill  through a series of excellent amend ments. I especially want to commend  the amendment offered by Congress woman PELOSI, which draws attention  to the plight of political prisoners in  China. Her amendment would require  that, before MFN status may be re newed for China, the President must  certify that the Chinese Government  has fully accounted for, and released,  political prisoners associated with last  year's prodemocracy movement.  I strongly support the amendments  offered by Ms. PELOSI, Mr. WOLF, Mr.  PORTER, and Mr. MILLER of Washing ton. These amendments, together with  the  excellent  legislation offered by  Mr. PEASE, will send a strong signal to  the leaders of China.  D 1440  ",1990

Madam Chairman, I  rise  in strong  support of this bill and especially the  amendment of the gentlewoman from  California  [Ms.  PELOSI]  and  the  amendment  that  I will  off er with  regard  to religious  freedom and the  amendment that the gentleman from  Illinois [Mr. PORTER] will offer and the  amendment that the gentleman from  California [Mr. MILLER] will offer.

Many people in Hong Kong understandably  dread the day their home reverts to Chinese  control. They are  fearful  that  the  freedoms  they have enjoyed, and which have resulted in  impressive economic growth and prosperity,  will come to an end.

As you may  know, the epicenter of the earthquake was lo cated 4 miles north of Aptos, CA.  It wreaked  havoc in the communities of Santa Cruz, Wat sonville, and Hollister. Billions of dollars' worth  of damage was caused by  the earthquake.  While many families and businesses have re covered  from damage and have moved on,  many others are still  trying  to deal with  the  economic and psychological damage of Octo ber 17.  As many of you know,  the downtown area  of Santa Cruz, specifically the Pacific Garden  Mall, was virtually destroyed. Before the earth quake  there were  600  businesses  in  the  downtown area; 206 of these businesses were  destroyed or dislocated because of the earth quake. The  city estimates  that 1,400  jobs  were lost because of the earthquake.  Some good news in the rebuilding process  was  the awarding of an economic develop ment grant  for  the development of the  jail house project in Santa Cruz. This project in volves the development of an old jailhouse in  ",1990
1729,1576,21,Mr. COLEMAN  of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker,  today I am introducing legislation for the relief  of Mr. Marcelino Serna of El Paso, TX. My bill  would make Mr. Serna eligible for the award  from the Army of the Congressional Medal of  Honor by stipulating that the regulation which  says that a nomination for that award must be  filed within 2 years of the acts ""above and  beyond the call of duty"" should be waived in  this case. In my judgment, Mr. Serna deserves  that medal just as surely as anyone who has  ever been so honored.  Marcelino Serna served  in  the U.S. Army  from 1917 to 1919. He was born in Chihuahua  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  City,  in  the Mexican state of Chihuahua,  in  1896. He  is now 94 years old and has held  U.S.  citizenship  since  1924.  Seventy-one  years ago, Mr. Serna was awarded the Army's  second highest award for valor in combat, the  Distinguished Service Cross. He was decorat ed with the highest military medals of Italy and  France. The descriptions of his exploits on the  battlefields of Belgium and France read  like  casebooks of heroism.  In  recovering  from  wounds suffered toward  the end of the war,  he was personally decorated by Gen. John  ""Black Jack"" Pershing.  Some have speculated that Mr. Serna was  not award the Medal of Honor either because  he was a buck private for most of the war, be cause he was not a citizen of this country at  the time, or because he could not speak Eng lish well.  I hope that none of these reasons  was ever given by anyone in a position of au thority in these matters. They are insulting and  they have no basis in law.  This bill, once enacted, would begin to right  a wrong-and to correct an oversight.  I urge  the committee of jurisdiction  to  take up  the  legislation as rapidly as possible so  that the  Army may look at the merits of this case.  AN  INTERESTING AND PROMIS ING RECYCLING INITIATIVE  HON. FRANK HORTON  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 18, 1990  ",1990
1730,1576,21,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  call attention to an  interesting and promising  recycling  initiative undertaken by  the Green  Bay Packaging Co., the Xerox Corp., and IBM.  These  three companies have developed a  practical use for recycled waste office paper.  The product  is called Eco-White and  it  is  used  in  the manufacturing  of  cardboard  boxes. At the request of Xerox and  IBM,  the  Green Bay Packaging Co. developed a proc ess to convert used office paper into the white  linerboard material used as the outer surface  layer of corrugated shipping containers.  American companies  throw away an esti mated 4.5 million tons of office waste paper  each year. Eco-White could put a substantial  dent in that figure. It draws its supplies from a  market which has only been minimally tapped  since only 5 percent of offices in this country  are currently  involved  in  recycling programs.  One hurdle preventing more firms from partici pating  is  the  lack of demand  for  recycled  fibers. Eco-White will create that demand.  Furthermore, the repulping process used to  turn copier paper into Eco-White is better for  the environment. By avoiding de-inking,  the  process  saves 25  percent of energy and  water use and results in a 200-percent reduc tion in solid waste.  Perhaps  the most important aspect of the  Eco-White process is  that  it  is private-sector  driven. Eco-White is an example of what can  be accomplished by the private sector when  left to find their own solutions to a burgeoning  problem.  I would like to salute the three corporations  responsible for this product: Xerox,  IBM, and  the Green Bay Packaging Co. By working toOctober 18, 1990  gether  to address  the solid waste problem  which confronts not just them, but all Ameri cans, these three have performed a valuable  public service.  It is not surprising that two of these compa nies, Xerox and IBM, are winners of the Mal colm Baldridge Quality Award.  Both  firms  needed  to demonstrate an exceptional com mitment to quality in order to win this distin guish award. With  the development of Eco White, it is apparent that both are as commit ted to public service and the environment as  they are to quality.  BETTY T. EGAN  HON. BILL RICHARDSON  OF NEW MEXICO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 18, 1990  ",1990
1731,1576,21,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, on the oc casion of National Business Women's Week, I  would  like my colleagues to join me  in con gratulating Betty T. Egan, who was  recently  chosen Santa Fe Business Woman of  the  Year by the Capital City Business and Profes sional Women.  Widowed as a young mother, she followed  her dream of  life  in  the West  to Santa Fe,  where she founded Rancho Encantado in Te suque north of the city. It has grown into one  of the major resorts in the Southwest  Mrs. Eagan was the first woman fire chief in  the country as head of the Tesuque Volunteer  Fire Department. A grandmother  for many  years,  she  is  credited with  fostering  the  growth and continued educational excellence  at Tesuque Elementary School.  She  is an active member of the American  Red Cross, and is one of only two women to  serve on the American Hotel and Motel Asso ciation resort committee. She has become a  familiar figure in the Santa Fe community, and  is an  inspiration to many of our young busi nesswomen and working mothers.  Mr. Speaker, as we salute working women  this week,  I suggest  to my colleagues  that  Betty Egan is a superior example of success  and grace in adversity.  DAWN GOERING A  SUPERWOMAN  HON. SHERWOOD L. BOEHLERT  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 18, 1990  ",1990
1732,1576,21,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker, ask the aver age person what his image of a hero is and  you would probably get a pretty  typical  re sponse: ""Faster than a speeding bullet, more  powerful  than a locomotive, able to  leap tall  buildings in a single bound.""  Mrs. Dawn Goering of Rome, NY is such a  woman. Energy and enthusiasm faster than a  speeding bullet; a desire  to succeed more  powerful than a locomotive; and  through her  enthusiasm  and  teachings,  she  lifts  those  around her higher  than  the  tallest building.  Sure she's a superwoman, and what's more  ",1990
