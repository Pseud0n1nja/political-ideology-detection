0,House,101,-0.082,11,1,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker, we  cannot see it, we cannot hear it, we  cannot feel it. We cannot even detect  it on radar. I am not talking about the  B-2 bomber today, I am talking about  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. It is about  as effective as placing a stop sign at  the Indy 500. It has done absolutely  nothing. Now it is beginning to rip off  the Social Security trust fund.  Mr. Speaker, I plan to introduce leg islation this week that would simply.  repeal Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. It is  a  turkey that should be shot down.  The American people cannot vote for  the Director of the Office of Manage ment and Budget. They vote for us. It  is our job to straighten this out.  Mr. Speaker, we  started Gramm Rudman with a $200 billion deficit.  Today we have a $204 billion deficit  and a bunch of IOU's in the Social Se curity account. Think about it.  THANKS, ""COLUMBIA,"" FOR A  JOB WELL DONE  <Mr. VOLKMER  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1990
1,House,101,-0.196,11,1,Mr. VOLKMER.," Mr. Speaker, it is  with a great deal of pride that I con gratulate the crew and all of NASA for  the  success  of  the  just-completed  flight of space shuttle Columbia. This  record-setting  flight ended Saturday  with a  remarkable night-time  touch down.  We can all be proud of the extraordi nary recovery our space program has  experienced in the last 3 years. And  this latest flight adds another dimen sion to that success.  This was  the  longest  flight by a  shuttle-11 days. This was the heavi est load in shuttle history-115 tons at  touchdown. But possibly the most re markable aspect of this flight was the  capture of an 11-ton satellite which  was  then  returned  to Earth  in  the  shuttle's cargo bay.  Those of us who have been early and  constant supporters of the space pro gram  and  specifically  the  shuttle  projects watched with pride as the five  members  of  the  shuttle  crew  per formed perfectly.  My congratulations go  to the crew  members and those on the ground who  once again have proven to the Nation  and to the world that America's supe riority  in  space has been  regained.  Thanks Columbia for a job well done.  D 1320  PRESIDENT  CRISTIAN!  STOOD  UP TO BOTH THE LEFT AND  RIGHT IN EL SALVADOR  <Mr. DREIER of California asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.)  ",1990
2,House,101,0.478,11,1,Mr. DREIER of California.," Mr.  Speaker, when one thinks of all the  developments which have taken place  since we adjourned last November 22  there are many issues which could be  discussed; of course successfully get ting rid of that narco-military dictator  Manuel A. Noriega in Panama, seeing  the crumbling of the Eastern bloc and  of course a wide  range of domestic  issues.  But I would like to on this first day  of the second session of the lOlst Con gress say  that  I believe one of  the  most  important developments which  took place during  the congressional  recess was taken by the duly elected  President of El Salvador, a man who  represents  the  first  transition  from  one  democratically  elected  govern ment to another in the history of that  country. What he did, Mr. Speaker,  was he very clearly stood up to both  the left and the right by working to  bring to justice those who are respon sible for the tragic massacre of Father  Ignacio Ellacuria and the five other  Jesuits.  We need to provide firm and strong  support to President Cristiani and this  fledgling democracy.  THE  HOUSE  SHOULD  OVER WHELMINGLY OVERRIDE THE  PRESIDENT'S VETO  (Mr. MORRISON  of Connecticut  asked and was given permission to ad dress the House for 1 minute and to  revise and extend his remarks.)  ",1990
3,House,101,-0.396,11,1,Mr. MORRISON of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Speaker, tomorrow this House will  vote on an override of the President's  veto of legislation to provide protec tion for Chinese students here in the  United States.  I urge my colleagues to overwhelm ingly vote in favor of this legislation  which passed the House in November  by a vote of 403 to 0.  This is not just routine immigration  legislation; this is human rights legis lation and we must answer for Amer ica the question of which side are we  on?  The President has lost his way. He  has kowtowed to the killers in Beijing.  He has forgotten that the proud flag  of America stands for human rights  and democracy. This legislation stands  for  that proud  tradition and  those  proud values.  We,  the Congress, must speak on  behalf of  the American people and  teach the lesson that in a democracy  wrong decisions by the leader can be  redressed.  We have accountability; it is the ac countability we were  sent here  to  bring to our Government.  On behalf of  the  people  of  the  United States the House should over whelmingly say  to  the Chinese stu dents and the Chinese people, ""We be lieve that the future of China lies in  democracy and freedom and we stand  up for that future.""  DECISION  TO  ORDER  27 ,000  ARMED TROOPS INTO PANAMA  MAY HAVE BEEN AN ACT OF  WAR  <Mr. BATES asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1990
4,House,101,-0.279,11,1,Mr. BATES.," Mr. Speaker, amid the  debate on the President's decision to  send  troops  to Panama we must,  I  think, question the manner in which  that decision was carried out. Were  the appropriate articles of the Consti tution considered and followed when  the  decision was made  to  invade  Panama? The power to declare war is  granted solely to the Congress of the  United States by the Constitution. If  existing  conditions  protecting  this  right are inadequate, additional meas ures must be developed and certainly  the War Powers Act is inadequate.  ",1990
5,House,101,0.585,24,1,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding,  and  I  also  thank her  for  taking this special order.  The Chinese students in the United  States, I believe, as the gentlewoman  has well explained, require protection.  Many of them have been active in a  democracy movement  in China, and  many of  their  relatives  have been  active, and they are afraid that they  are going to be forced to go back and  suffer  the persecution  that we wit nessed  in Tiananmen Square. And  that repression continues.  I  think  everybody  in  the United  States felt horrified when  they saw  those  tanks  go  into  Tiananmen  Square,  and  they  found out  subse quently  that  they  literally  ground  young Chinese  students who were  seeking democracy  into meat on the  streets.  D 1450  In addition  to  that, Mr. Speaker,  these young people used the United  States as a model. Their Statue of Lib erty that they showed in Tiananmen  Square was modeled after our Statue  of Liberty; their Statue of Democracy  rather.  Mr. Speaker, we should feel a close  kinship  for  those Chinese  students  who are here in this country studying,  and who want  democracy  in  their  country, and who want to make sure  that that happens at some point in the  future and who do not want to have to  go back prematurely and suffer the  consequences of their call for democ racy.  So, Mr. Speaker, I support the legis lation of the gentlewoman from Cali fornia [Ms. PELOSI]. I will vote to over ride tomorrow. We do not always see  eye to eye. This issue cuts across party  lines. It cuts across philosophical lines.  On both sides of the aisle, whether we  are liberal, conservative, Democrat, or  Republican; I think that we are going  to find tomorrow that there is going to  be overwhelming support for the legis lation of the gentlewoman from Cali fornia [Ms. PELOSI] on overriding the  President's veto.  So, Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the  gentlewoman  from  California  [Ms.  PELOSI] for that.  I would  like  to say  just one more  thing, Mr. Speaker. I am a big sup porter of President Bush and Vice  President QUAYLE.  I  think my voting  record will  indicate  that  I  support  them as much, or probably more than,  most people in the House, and I really  support the administration and,  like  most people  in  this country,  think  that  they are doing an outstanding  job.  However, Mr. Speaker, I was a little  bit chagrined when I saw the head of  the NSC, Mr.  Scowcroft, General  Scowcroft, and one of our assistant  secretaries, Mr. Eagleburger,  go  to  China and start working toward open ing up a normal relationship so soon  after the Tiananmen massacre when  there  have  been  no  appreciable  changes in the attitudes of the Chi nese Government toward their people.  The repression continues, and the re pression will continue until the world  brings  pressure upon  that Govern ment to make positive change.  So, while  I have great admiration  and support  for  this administration  and all  the  things they are doing,  I  would say this is one place where I  take strong exception to  the actions  that have been taking place vis-a-vis  our relations with China. We should  let the Chinese Government know in  no uncertain terms that this type of  action is  intolerable, that the people  of the United States of America and  the people of the world will not stand  idly by and accept this kind of action  and that we are going to do everything  we can to bring pressure to bear upon  it, economic pressure, or whatever it  takes, for them to bring about positive  change.  Mr. Speaker, we have seen in East ern Europe countries that have been  under the boot, the heel, of commu nism for 40 years move  toward free dom and democracy, and we should be  helping them, and we will be helping  them, and at the time we are helping  these countries, these fledgling democ racies, head  for  full democracy and  participation in the world community  we should not be opening our arms to  a  repressive  totalitarian Communist  government in China.  Mr. Speaker,  tomorrow  I will  be  very, very happy to vote with the gen tlewoman  from  California  [Ms.  PELOSI] to override this veto, and I ap preciate her yielding this time to me.  ",1990
6,House,101,-0.491,24,1,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I appreci ate  the  remarks  of  the gentleman  from  Indiana.  [Mr. BURTON].  I  also  thank him for signing the Dear Col league in support of the override and  for his help on this issue.  Mr. Speaker, this is not a partisan  issue, as the gentleman from Indiana  [Mr. BURTON] so ably pointed out. It  has never been intended to be anti the  President. It is an issue that passed  the House and passed the Senate with out one negative vote, 403 to 0 in the  House of Representatives. I am very  proud of the bipartisan support that  we were able to gather for the bill be cause it is a reasonable bill, and it does  precisely what it sets out to do, to pro tect the students. So, it is just a dis agreement on tactics.  Mr. Speaker, I  think we all would  like  to  look  forward  to  a  brilliant  future with China,  a  future bright  with cultural, economic, and political  ties, but it has to be done at least with  some  integrity  from our standpoint,  and I think that sending the message  that this bill would send is a clearer  message  than the message  that was  contained  in  the  toast  that General  Scowcroft made  when  he  visited  China. Because the issue of safety is so  critical and so fundamental to this bill  that we must protect the students be cause they cannot go back unless it is  safe,  I was  particularly  concerned  about the choice of words of General  Scowcroft when he lifted his glass to  toast the authorities in Beijing when  he said, ""There are forces in both of  our societies which would  strive  to  thwart or redirect our efforts to coop eration. We must take action to stop  those negative forces.""  Mr.  Speaker,  I  found  that  toast  frightening,  equating us with  them  and that we must take action to stop  those negative forces. I think a better  message to the Chinese authorities is  that when people speak out  in  the  United States of America on behalf of  democracy that we are not going  to  send them home to a situation where  people get killed for speaking out for  freedom, as the gentleman from Indi ana [Mr. BURTON] described in his re marks.  Also I think the gentleman from In diana [Mr. BURTON] mentioned East ern Europe, and I  think that is very  relevant here because the day or two  before the President left on his trip  for Malta, taking with him all of our  hopes and aspirations for peace in the  world and all of our good wishes for  that,  the Secretary of State said  in  effect, and I think these are his exact  words, but in effect he said that we  must support the prodemocratic move ment in Eastern Europe and help out  so that it can proceed and succeed.  So, Mr. Speaker, that gave us hope  that maybe the President would sign  the Chinese student bill the next day  because that is what we were doing helping  a  prodemocratic movement  proceed and succeed. However, as far  as  I know,  the  last official act  the  President performed was not to sign  the Chinese student bill, and he sent it  back to the House unsigned. It was a  little disappointing.  Mr. Speaker, I think that one of the  disadvantages  that we have  is  that  people are thinking in old ways. They  are  thinking,  ""Well, we've not had  human rights as an item on the table  in our relationship with China. It has  been an issue in Europe, so it will con tinue to be an issue in Europe, but in  China it isn't an issue.""  I know that the President, and the  Vice President, and the Secretary of  State, and General Scowcroft all care  about human rights  throughout  the  world. There  is  no question  about  that. But I think that this has to be a  recognition that history is in a hurry.  It is in a hurry in Eastern Europe, it is  in a hurry in China, and we cannot  revert  to old ways of dealing with  China.

9,Senate,101,-0.301,63,1,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  to  inform my  colleagues  that  today marks  the  1,774th day  that  Terry Anderson has been held in cap tivity in Beirut.  As we enter the second session of  this Congress, I ask that we continue  to pay attention to Terry Anderson's  captivity-it has been nearly 5 years and to the ordeal that persists for his  family.  HEARING ON CHINESE  STUDENTS AND CHINA POLICY  ",1990
10,Senate,101,-0.443,63,1,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, this  morning the Subcommittee on Immi gration and Refugee Affairs held a  hearing  on  Chinese  students  and  human rights in China. The testimony  received was really quite disturbing and extremely relevant to our upcom ing vote on overriding the President's  veto of the Emergency Chinese Immi gration Relief Act.  The subcommittee heard from Am bassador Winston Lord, our Ambassa dor to China during the Reagan ad ministration, who expressed criticism  of the administration's policy toward  China, and urged Congress to override  the President's veto of the Emergency  Chinese Immigration Relief Act.  We also heard very troubling state ments from Chinese students in Amer ica who have been threatened and har assed by their own Embassy officials  for even minimal participation in pro democracy  activities  here.  Chinese  Embassy officials have demanded that  students  involved  in  the democracy  movement submit written confessions  and self-criticisms of their pro-democ racy activities, and many have been in formed that they will be branded for  life as traitors and counterrevolution aries if they do not.  The students reported that the har assment has in fact increased since the  President vetoed the bill on November  30.  Finally, the subcommittee received a  legal analysis from the Congressional  Research  Service which  highlights  some of the points on which the ad ministration's actions  on behalf of  Chinese students may be subject  to  court challenges. The  legal analysis  was published yesterday by the Ameri can Law Division of CRS.  Mr. President, I ask that Ambassa dor Lord's statement before the sub committee and that of Dr. Hai Ching  Zhao be included in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the state ments were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  OPENING  REMARKS  BY  WINSTON  LORD,  SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, JANUARY 23,  1990  Mr. Chairman, Members of the Commit tee:  Thank you for inviting me to comment on  the Emergency Chinese Immigration Relief  Act of 1989 <H.R. 2712).    Strengthening America's relations with  China has been my mission for two decades.  Thus I come to the debate concerning Chi nese students in this country in the broader  context of American policy  toward China  and our long range national interests. My  journey to this Committee, I confess, has  been a troubling one.  As  a concerned citizen,  I  am generally  against Congressional micromanagement of  foreign policy and the rigidities often intro duced by tactical legislation. As a bipartisan  public servant for twenty years, my inclina tion  is  to  support  a President's foreign  policy whenever I can. As a Republican who  admires President Bush, served him and ap plauds his overall foreign policy, I particu larly regret having to oppose this Adminis tration.  Nonetheless, with  considerable  ambiva lence and reluctance, I am here to urge the  Congress to override the President's veto.  This I strongly believe: fairly or unfairly,  the vote on  this  issue will be  interpreted  abroad and at home not just as a decision on  how best  to protect Chinese students  in  America, but more fundamentally as a refer endum on our posture toward the current  Chinese regime.  This is the reality: fairly or unfairly, the  veto, if sustained, would reinforce the mind set and mandate of those who have proceed ed from massacre to repression; those who  predict America will be lulled by cosmetic  gestures  and  return  to business-as-usual;  those who dismiss the Chinese as a people  apart from the global winds of change.  This, too, is the reality: the legislation, if  enacted, would send a powerful message of  encouragement  to  those  in China whose  voices have been silenced and to Chinese  citizens everywhere who seek a freer, more  open country.  As for the legal arguments, they are com plex and difficult for the amateur to judge.  On balance I think they also favor override.  Clearly the President shares the Congres sional concern about the dangers to Chinese  students and believes his means accomplish  the same ends as the legislation at hand.  Many lawyers as well as members of Con gress assert, however, that his administra tive action could be challenged  in court.  Furthermore, reliance on INS instructions  carries less weight symbolically, if not legal ly, than an executive order or Presidential  determination.  Whatever the ultimate  legal  judgments,  there is no question that today Chinese stu dents feel uncertain, uneasy-and vulnera ble. It is best to remove all doubts through  the  unambiguous means  of  legislation.  Those who have lived in China where laws  do not protect the individual seek security  in the laws of the United States. Passage of  legislation would fortify the students psy chologically as well as legally.  The  President's  administrative  action  laudably  extends protection beyond  stu dents. The Congress, if it cannot amend this  bill, should urgently review  this aspect to  ensure that there is no risk to Chinese here  who are not students.  The crucial consideration, however,  re mains the diplomatic context of the looming  vote.  In response to series of major American  initiatives,  the Chinese  regime has made  only minimal moves while still pursuing its  overall policy of suppression, rollback of re forms and attacks on foreign influence. The  passage of this legislation would make clear  that Americans are not fooled by smoke and  mirrors, that we are a serious people.  The Chinese people share the same aspi rations as Eastern Europeans and others  around the world. They, not the hardliners  in Beijing, represent the future of China and thus our long term national interest.  Their day is not distant. I believe there will  be a more moderate, humane government in  Beijing before  this  legislation  is  due  to  expire. Whenever such a government does  take hold and once again makes China invit ing, the Congress should repeal this bill. We  should  then  encourage  the  students  to  return to their homeland and work to lift its  horizons.  Surely  the President,  through his veto,  does not wish to send the wrong signals to  China or to the students here. But this is  the inescapable consequence of the recent  pattern of Administration actions  toward  Beijing. If the veto and accompanying ad ministrative instructions were carried out in  the context of a firm, balanced policy of  condemnation and connection,  the Presi dent's position would probably not be mis construed. But in the wake of the misguided  Scowcroft missions  and other unilateral  American steps, defeat of  this  legislation  would be assessed by both Beijing and the  world as one more step toward unrequited  normalization. Unfair perhaps, but reality.  This need not have been the case. Until  the announcement of the December Scow croft trip, the balance of our overall China  policy seemed about right. I, for one, con sistently supported  the President  for six  months, including in my November testimo ny before  the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee. Although  I  sounded much  harsher criticism of Chinese policies than  the Administration,  I  thought  that  the  President was  correct  to  stress our  long  term concerns while maintaining selective  sanctions.  In my view the Scowcroft journey-in sub stance and style-destroyed that balance. In  the process it also shattered the broad bi partisan consensus on China policy that we  had enjoyed for twenty years through five  administrations. Rather than reiterate my  reasoning I ask that my December 19, 1989  Washington Post article be included as part  of  the record.  I wrote that editorial <and  had previously supported  the Administra",1990
11,Senate,101,-0.212,128,1,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I first  want to  thank the chairman of the  committee,  Senator BURDICK,  from  North Dakota. The Senator has been  very, very solid, and very, very wise in  his handling of the committee, bring ing groups together. It is through the  stewardship of his chairmanship, Mr.  President, frankly, that we are here.  Mr. President, we are beginning the  1990's on a positive note. Here it is,  January 23, 1990. At long last, after a  decade of delay, we will enact a new  Clean Air Act. It has taken leadership  beginning with that of the President.  President Bush, who broke the polit ical gridlock, proposed a comprehen sive bill; our Majority Leader, GEORGE  MITCHELL, from Maine, who has been  our  leading  clean  air  advocate  for  years; the chairman of our committee,  QUENTIN BURDICK from North Dakota,  whose able leadership brings us here;  and certainly  that of Senator JOHN  CHAFEE  from Rhode  Island,  a  very  strong advocate of strong environmen tal  laws for many years-he,  too,  is  ",1990
12,Senate,101,-0.262,167,1,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I rise to  introduce the Department of the Envi ronment Act  of  1990,  a  bill  that,  among other  things,  transforms  the  Environmental Protection Agency into  a new Cabinet-level department, the  Department of the Environment.  I am pleased that the distinguished  ranking member of the Governmental  Affairs Committee, Senator ROTH,  is  here to join me in this introduction,  since the bill is a product of a  joint  effort involving ourselves, our staffs,  and the administration.  I am also pleased  to announce as  original cosponsors Senators LIEBER MAN, KOHL, LEVIN,  LAUTENBERG,  and  BINGAMAN.  Mr. President, 20 years ago, the Con gress created the Environment Protec tion Agency as a response to what was  perceived as a serious and growing pollution problem  that  threatened  the  health and well being of the American  people. We have made progress  in  many areas,  though not enough  to  become complacent  in any area.  In  some  areas,  problems  have  gotten  worse. Twenty years ago, few persons  thought about the long-range  trans port of pollutants across international  boundaries; of acid rain falling in con tinental  Europe  because  coal was  being burned  in England; of ocean  dumping of toxic substances that wash  up on distant shores; of radioactive  particles  falling  from  the  sky over  France,  Germany,  Belgium,  and  Poland from a nuclear accident in the  Soviet Union; of destruction of  the  stratospheric ozone  layer,  that pro tects  us  from  damaging ultraviolet  rays, from the release of millions of  tons of chlorofluorocarbon compounds  in our spray cans, refrigerators and air  conditioners; and of the possibility of  a potentially disastrous warming of  the Earth from emissions of carbon di oxide resulting from  the burning of  fossil fuels.  Last November, the Administrator of  EPA attended an international meet ing with environmental ministers from  67 other countries to discuss and adopt  an agreement in principle on the stabi lization of carbon dioxide emissions.  Like  it or not,  international agree ments  to  achieve  environmental  progress are now a necessary feature  of  sound  environmental  protection  policy.  These global concerns-stratospheric  ozone  destruction,  the  creation  of  ozone ""smog"" from deteriorating for ests, acid  rain, desertification, ocean  pollution, and trafficking in hazardous  waste, as well as the national pollution  problems stemming from development  and  industrialization  have  induced  every major  industrialized nation  to  create a ministerial post for environ mental protection with the only excep tion being the United States, where  environmental concerns are handled  by subcabinet officers.  As we approach the end of the 20th  century,  it  is  time  for  the United  States to move aggressively in a lead ership position across the board in the  solution of global environmental prob lems. To do otherwise is to consign the  quality of life of all Americans to the  policy decisions of others-and what  else  should one call  that except a  threat to our national security?  It is a fact of diplomatic life that the  seriousness with which one views an other government's concerns is influ enced by the stature of the person ar ticulating  those concerns. A subcab inet EPA does not send the appropri ate signal to the rest of the world as to  the priority and leadership to be given  by the United States to the cause of  environmental protection. If this were  the only argument in favor of elevat",1990
13,Senate,101,0.2,193,1,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President,  today  I  am offering  legislation  on  behalf of myself and Senator HATCH to  eliminate a provision that permits pen sion funds to receive less than compre hensive audits.  Our private pension system is based  on the concept of fiduciary responsi bility and full disclosure. The integrity  of our private pension system is essen tial. In 1988 employer pensions paid  the Nation's retirees more than $222  billion in benefits, compared to $148  billion paid to retirees by Social Secu rity. Independent audits play an im portant role in securing full disclosure  for plan beneficiaries.  Currently, under the Employee Re tirement Income Security Act, pension  funds are only required to receive lim ited scope audits. A limited-scope audit  means that pension fund managers are  allowed to instruct auditors not to ex amine assets held in government-regu lated entities, such as banks or insur ance companies. The bottom  line  is  that some pension plans are currently  receiving  less  than  thorough audits.  Absent  thorough and comprehensive  audits, the integrity and assurance in tended by ERISA for pension benefici aries will not be achieved. This is 'be coming  an  increasingly  important  issue because of the trend of deregula tion of our financial institutions, and  the growing size of private pension  funds. As our society ages, these funds  will  take on an even greater signifi cance.  The importance of full disclosure is  not solely limited to plan beneficiaries.  All taxpayers have a very real interest  in assuring that private pension plans  receive a  thorough and  independent  audit. Under ERISA, the majority of  private pension plans are insured by  the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corpo ration. Like a variety of other Federal  insurance plans, the PBGC is a Gov ernment-sponsored  enterprise. Over  the past decade we  certainly have  learned the importance of maintaining  tight regulation and requiring full dis closure of  industries and enterprises  enjoying Federal insurance.  Our  pension  insurance  system  is  strong today. It is only with the type  of  continued vigilance  provided by  thorough audits and meaningful regulation that we can assure the integrity  of  the  private  pension  system  for  future beneficiaries.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the bill be print ed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the    S.2012  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION  I.

14,Senate,101,0.382,193,1,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased today to cosponsor legislation  introduced by Senator NANCY KASSE BAUM  to eliminate a provision in cur rent  law  that permits  limited scope  audits of private pension plans under  the Employee Retirement Income Se curity Act of 1974 [ERISAJ.  I  agree with Senator KASSEBAUM  that our pension insurance system is  strong today. I also share with Senator  KASSEBAUM and the Secretary of Labor  the concern that we remain vigilant in  our efforts to ensure the continuing  integrity of our Nation's system.  This bill  represents an  important  step in that regard. Further, I under stand that the Secretary of Labor is  currently reviewing a number of pro posals  aimed  at  improving  and  strengthening ERISA enforcement. I  look forward to working with the ad ministration in the coming months in  developing  appropriate measures  to  further ensure the continued strength  and integrity of private pension plans.

15,Senate,101,0.068,206,1,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, today  I join Senator DoLE as an original co sponsor in introducing a  joint resolu tion which will honor the lOOth anni versary of the birth of Dwight David  Eisenhower by designating October 14,  1990, as ""Dwight D. Eisenhower Day""  and calling for a joint meeting of Con gress to commemorate this centennial.  In furtherance of this national cele bration,  the Eisenhower Foundation,  an organization devoted to promoting  the goals, ideals, and legacy of Dwight  Eisenhower, the Dwight D. Eisenhow er Society, which conducts programs  to highlight the work of Eisenhower,  Gettysburg College, and other organi zations will host a  series of events  during the year to celebrate this anni versary. The activities will include a 4day symposium comprised of interna tional  scholars,  government  leaders,  and military  leaders  at Gettysburg  College  in October 1990, as well as  presentations, seminars, art exhibits,  and other events in honor of President  Eisenhower.  Raised in Abilene, KS, President Ei senhower developed  his  interest  in  military history early in his childhood.  He began an honorable career of mili tary service with his enrollment in the  U.S. Military Academy at West Point  in 1911. Following graduation in 1915,  Eisenhower spent several years serving  his country in ranking military posi tions. After World War I, he re~mmed  the permanent rank of captain and  soon was promoted to major. Receiv ing a series of promotions, Eisenhower  continued  his  loyal  service  to  the  United States throughout World War  II. In 1944, his superior military skill  was recognized with the award of the  rank of five-star general of the U.S.  Army.  Dwight  Eisenhower  subsequently  went on to serve as president of Co lumbia University and as the Supreme  Commander of  the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization [NATO]. On No vember 4, 1952, the country recognized  Eisenhower's ability  and  vision  by  electing him the 34th President of the  United States. He was  reelected  4  years later.  As President of the United States,  Eisenhower was known for his staunch  anticommunism. His personal dislike  of this oppressive system evolved into  a policy of aiding any country threat ened by Communist aggression or sub version-the Eisenhower doctrine.  In  1961, Eisenhower delivered a farewell  address which articulated a four-point  agenda for  the Nation. The  themes  identified by Eisenhower almost 30  years ago are among the most pressing  issues of our time, typifying Eisenhow er's wisdom and foresight.  It is fitting that Gettysburg should  honor Eisenhower since his connection  to the town can be traced back to 1915  when he  first  traveled  there  as  a  senior cadet at West Point  to study  military tactics. Three years later Ei senhower returned as commander of  Camp Colt,  a  deserted Gettysburg  campsite which underwent  transfor mation into a training center for the  newly formed Tank Corps. Upon com pletion of his duty, Eisenhower  left  the area, but returned once again in  1946 to receive an honorary doctor of  laws degree from Gettysburg College.  In 1950, President Eisenhower pur chased land in Gettysburg and built a  home for his family, in which he lived  at various times during his Presidency  and thereafter. He later served as a  trustee of Gettysburg College  from  1961 to 1969. The Eisenhower farm in  Gettysburg today is maintained by the  U.S. National Park Service as a continuing tribute to the significant con tributions of Dwight Eisenhower.  Last October at Gettysburg College,  which  sponsored one of  the many  kickoff ceremonies nationwide for the  Eisenhower centennial, David Eisen hower, grandson and biographer of  the  former  President,  shared  his  thoughts about his grandfather and  Gettysburg:  Dwight D.  Eisenhower's  identification  with Gettysburg was profound. This was  the place I knew him best and the place he  felt natural and at home. I always hoped  the town and the college would respond in  the way they have today.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  to  join in supporting  this  important  resolution to recognize the service of  President Dwight D. Eisenhower on  the lOOth anniversary of his birth.

FEDERAL EMPLOYEES RECOGNITION WEEK  e ",1990
16,Senate,101,-0.435,206,1,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr.  President,  today I am introducing a joint resolu tion to designate the week beginning  March 5, 1990, as Federal Employees  Recognition Week. I have introduced  similar  resolutions  in previous Con gresses to honor the men and women  who work in jobs that are so critically  important to the strength and vitality  of our Nation. The  individuals who  make up the Federal work force have  made significant contributions to im prove the quality of life and provide  essential services for Americans and  indeed  for  others  throughout  the  world. I again want to commend the  more than 3 million men and women  who perform those jobs.  Federal workers continue to be the  source of growth and development in  America, helping Americans achieve  strong, energetic, and prosperous com munities. I am proud that our Govern ment has such a highly qualified and  competent work force. If our Govern ment did not have such knowledgea ble, capable hardworking individuals,  America would not be in the forefront  of medical and scientific research and  the development of new  technology:  Great achievements have been made  by Federal employees over the years  in these areas.  In my view, the Nation as a whole,  and perhaps the entire world has ben efited  from  the accomplishments of  Federal workers. The men and women  who work  for our Government are  positive about their work and the op",1990

Al has been oper ations manager, and he holds  the  longest  tenure in the school district. His service to the  schools of San Mateo County represents the  highest and finest tradition of public service.  Mr. Speaker, Al Teglia was born in the city  of Colma  in San Mateo County of Genoese  immigrant parents in 1931. He grew up in Daly  City, attended Jefferson High School and then  the College of San Mateo. Upon graduation  he began work with  the San Mateo Union  High School District.  Al has served the people of our peninsula in  a number of key posts. He has been elected a  Daly City Councilman for three terms, and he  held the office of Daly City mayor three times.  Al  is a member of  the San Mateo Council  Transportation Authority, the SamTrans Board  of Director, and numerous other boards and  commissions serving the citizens of our penin sula. He also was elected to three terms as  members of the board of trustees of Jefferson  Union High School,  president of  the San  Mateo County School Boards Association, and  delegate  to  the assembly of  the California  School Boards Association. Al  T eglia  has  served  our  peninsula  community  on  the  boards of  the San Mateo County Historical  Society, the Daly City-Colma Historical Socie ty,  the San Mateo County Arts Council and  many other organizations.  In 1988, he received  the Columbus Award  of  the San Mateo County  Italian American  Federation, and  in 1985 was given  the Hu manitarian-of-the-Year Award  from  the San  Mateo County Easter Seal Society. He has  been honored by  the Daly City Jaycees,  the  Hispanic Concilio of San Mateo County and a  number of other community groups and orga nizations.  Mr. Speaker,  I invite my colleagues  in  the  Congress to  join me  in paying well-deserved  243  tribute  to my constituent and dear  friend, Al  Teglia, on the occasion of his retirement from  the San Mateo Union High School District.  It  is also our sincere hope, however, that Al will  continue his dedicated and active involvement  in community service for the residents of our  peninsula.  TRIBUTE TO DR. RALPH WYATT  ADAMS  HON. WILLIAM L. DICKINSON  OF ALABAMA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 23, 1990  ",1990
18,,101,0.398,245,1,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr. Speaker, as we move  into the new year, I would like to note the ac complishments of a special Alabamian who  retired  in 1989, Dr. Ralph Wyatt Adams of  Troy, AL.  Born on June 4, 1915, at Samson, AL, Dr.  Ralph Adams received his A.B. degree  from  Birmingham-Southern College, then the LLB.,  LLD., and J.D. degrees from the University of  Alabama. He  is married  to Dorothy Kelly  Adams and they have three grown children.  On September 1, 1989, Dr. Ralph Adams  retired  from  the duties of both president of  Troy State University and chancellor of  the  Troy State University  system. He  had  as sumed  the duties of president of Troy State  University on October 1, 1964, after complet ing a  long, honorable  tour of duty with  the  U.S. Air Force,  the U.S. Air Force Reserve,  and  the Alabama Air National Guard. He re tired  from  the military as a major general on  June 3, 1975.  Dr. Adams served under President John F.  Kennedy as head of  the Alabama Selective  Service System,  then under President Gerald  R. Ford as a member of his Presidential Clem ency Board. He has also served as chairman  of the council of presidents for the Alabama  Commission on Higher Education,  the Ala bama State Personnel Board, and  the Ala bama State  Insurance Board. He has also  served as president of the Alabama Associa tion  of College  and University Presidents.  Indeed, a  list of his positions of responsible  leadership could be continued at great length.  Through his performance as a community  and academic leader, Dr. Ralph Wyatt Adams  has distinguished himself by securing many  noteworthy honors. He was Man of the Year  for Troy, AL (in both 1968 and 1975); distin guished alumnus of Birmingham-Southern Col lege in 1978, and designated one of the top  100 Most Effective College Presidents by the  Exxon Education Foundation in 1986. For his  dedication  to  the enhancement of the multi cultural education program on his campus at  Troy State University, Dr. Adams received the  Order of the Rising Sun from the Government  of Japan in May 1989.  Dr. Adams has attracted many scholars of  international acclaim  to address Troy State  University students, and through his close as sociation with the English-Speaking Union, Dr.  Adams was named  to  the National Board of  Directors of the English-Speaking Union in the  USA. Ever since 1972, Troy State University  has provided a full 1-year scholarship to a stu dent from England. The criteria for receipt of  ",1990
19,,101,-0.479,258,1,Mr. MINETA.," Mr. Speaker, this past decade  has seen a desire  to  review and reconsider  some momentous events which occurred 48  years ago. Given this Nation's common thirst  for the future and disinterest in the past, such  a reconsideration is as unique as it is fruitful.  These events of a previous generation were  powerful  enough  to  pull  the  attention  of  today's historians, lawmakers, civil libertarians,  and artists. As a result, we are now  taking  steps to redress some wrongs committed long  ago and thus to reaffirm our great Constitution  and the freedoms guaranteed therein.  Our reflections on the past must include ac knowledgement of  those  few who had  the  vision and strength, when these wrongs were  executed, to stand up in protest. George Knox  Roth was one of this small group. He, and a  few  others,  spoke  out  and  fallowed  their  hearts and  their principles,  rather  than  the  winds of popularity. They suffered  for  their  stand.  On February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt  signed Executive Order 9066, which was  to  lead to the wholesale abrogation of civil rights  of thousands of loyal Americans of Japanese  ancestry. These acts and the tragedies which  thus resulted were the result of wartime hyste ria,  racial prejudice, and a failure of political  leadership.  At  the  time of  the evacuation and  intern ment of  this group of  loyal Americans,  few  voices were. raised  in protest. Often,  those  who spoke in favor of the freedom and rights  of Americans of Japanese ancestry and of  their belief in the loyalty of these hard-working  citizens were  themselves ostracized as were  those of Japanese ancestry. George Knox  Roth spoke out, and saw his personal life de stroyed.  Such a stigma can cling  for years. many  years. To this day I receive mail from people  who have not yet realized  the difference be tween Americans of Japanese ancestry and a  long-gone government of Japan. These letters  still attempt to place a stigma on  the shoul ders of Americans of Japanese ancestry.  The costs of such senseless prejudice are  high-to the people ostracized as well as  to  those others who spoke out for justice. Our  Nation, however, pays the highest price of all  through  the  loss of human  resources,  ideas  and contributions. We pay the price in the ero sion of progress toward  the  ideals which we  seek and in the undermining of the institutions  and principles on which our Nation is built.  January 23, 1990  Mr. Speaker, we should be especially grate ful to those voices who struggled for what was  right. We must recognize their cries for justice,  cries unclouded by fear, or anger, or ambition.  It has taken many years for this Nation to  face up to a shameful wrong. But only by ad mitting this wrong can we begin to hope that  such a tragedy never again occurs.  On March 9, George Knox Roth will be 83  years old. I ask my colleagues to join me in a  salute  to George and  to his  leadership. His  stand caused him  to suffer many sacrifices  over  the  years. We  cannot  rectify  those  losses, but we can thank him for his unwaver ing vision. Without the efforts of men like him,  the tragedy of the evacuation and internment  would never have been redressed.  Thank you.  NEW YEAR ADDRESS OF CZECH OSLOVAK PRESIDENT VACLAV  HAVEL  HON.

Hudgens, who died January 5 at age  76 at Community Hospital in Mayfield, KY.  Mr. Hudgens, a beloved and highly respect ed Bardwell, KY, resident, was a former sheriff  of Carlisle County, the father-in-law of the Car lisle County superintendent of schools, Robert  Edward Watson of Bardwell,  a veteran of  World War  II  and  a member of Bardwell  United Methodist Church.  Mr. Hudgens, who was affectionately  re ferred  to as  ""Shug"" by  friends, was always  very helpful to those of us who called on him  for assistance. Shug Hudgens and his family  were very helpful  to me as early as 1967  when I was a 29-year-old candidate for State  senator. He was preceded  in death by his  lovely and  talented wife, Martha Turner Hud gens.  Surviving  are  three  daughters,  Brenda  Watson and Ann Carter, both of Bardwell, and  Phyllis Hughes of Virginia; a son, Joe Hud gens of Bardwell; a sister, Mona Coil of Padu cah, and several grandchildren.  My wife Carol and I extend to the family of  Arnold L. Hudgens our sympathy.  TRIBUTE TO CPL. IV.AND. PEREZ  HON. CLAUDINE SCHNEIDER  OF RHODE ISLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 23, 1990  ",1990
21,,101,-0.026,271,1,Ms. SCHNEIDER.," Mr .. Speaker, Cpl.  Ivan  Perez of Pawtucket, RI, died a hero's death in  combat. He paid the highest price and made  the ultimate sacrifice  for  the United States.  We owe him an eternal debt of gratitude.  In the early morning hours of December 20,  1989, Corporal Perez rode into battle. He was  in the first Bravo Company platoon to attack  General Noriega's headquarters-the Coman dancia. During  the ensuing  firefight, Perez,  who manned the .50 caliber machinegun atop  an armored personnel carrier, was killed  in  combat. His bravery helped our Armed Forces  to quickly knock out Noriega's headquarters  and neutralize any organized opposition.  Our gratitude  to Corporal Perez  is strong  and unquestioned. However,  Ivan Perez won  the gratitude of another set of people: The  Panamanians.  During  my  recent  trip  to  Panama,  I saw firsthand the ravages of Gen eral Noriega and felt the palpable relief of the  Panamanian people. Ivan Perez was a libera tor-he died so that millions could live without  tyranny.  Today, I am introducing a bill to make Cor poral Perez an American citizen. I understand  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  that Corporal Perez planned to apply for citi zenship upon leaving the Armed Forces. I feel  that it is the least we can do to make him a  citizen posthumously.  Today, I salute Cpl. Ivan D. Perez as a great  American and a fellow Rhode  Islander. May  his memory live forever.  CITIZENS FEDERAL SAVINGS:  THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT S&L'S  HON. WILLIAM LEHMAN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 23, 1990  ",1990
22,,101,-0.483,271,1,Mr. LEHMAN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, if all  savings and  loans were operated  like  the  Miami-based Citizens Federal Savings,  there  wouldn't be a need for bailout bills and crimi nal prosecutions.  Founded by my old  friend,  the  late David  Stuzin and brilliantly guided through the past  turbulent decade by his son Charles, Citizens  Federal has enjoyed several years of profit ability; successful expansion  into markets  in  states outside Florida; and a capital  reserve  that exceeds Federal standards by one  third  at a time when a quarter of all U.S. thrifts are  unable to meet the minimum.  The Miami Herald  recently  profiled  this  Miami institution and its remarkable CEO, and  I would like to commend this artiCle to the at tention of my colleagues.  During  these days of  savings  and  loan  scandals, closings and failures, Citizens Fed eral should be a model for every savings and  loan.  [From the Miami Herald, Jan. 15, 1990]  THE Goon CITIZENS  (By Gregg Fields)  Was  there  ever  a  better  citizen  than  Jimmy Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life?  He was a  tireless community worker. He  was a selfless civic booster. He was-gasp!-a  savings and loan executive.  an S&L executive himself, Charles  Stuzin hasn't found the public to have such  warm  regard  for  thrift executives  lately,  however.  ""So after I  tell them I'm a thrift execu tive, I tell them I'm also a lawyer,"" chuckles  Stuzin, chairman of Miami's Citizens Feder al Savings.  In realjty, if there are worthy successors  to  Stewart's mythical  legacy,  they  are  Stuzin and Citizens Federal, say competi tors, analysts and former co-workers.  Citizens is boasting seven years of improv ing operating profits in an era when even  healthy  savings  associations  are  losing  money.  It surpasses new  federal  capital  standards by a  third at a  time when 760  thrifts-a fourth of  the U.S.  total-can't  meet the minimum. It is looking expansively  toward  the future at a  time when many  S&Ls are trying frantically to lop off the  excesses of the past.  The key to success: In the 1980s, Citizens  went against the grain and stayed conserva tive.  Instead of entering bidding wars for  consumer deposits, it quietly sought inves tors seeking unexciting but safe  returns.  When  thrifts  from  around  the  country  spent enormous sums of money  to enter  Florida, Citizens expanded in the unglamor ous Midwest.  As  269  Perhaps most significantly, as S&Ls were  buying  junk bonds and building country  clubs, Citizens stuck stubbornly to the basi cally dull business of home loans.  ""In an industry that's collapsing, Charlie  Stuzin  is a  real beacon,"" says Bill Allen,  chairman of Citizens competitor Atico Sav ings. ""He's gone out and made money the  old-fashioned way. And  his  integrity  is  beyond reproach.""  Along the way, Stuzin became a national  figure within his industry. It is an industry  whose foundations are being badly shaken,  he concedes. ""I think half the thrift indus try will disappear,"" he says. ""I'm talking  about the healthy ones.""  When asked whether Citizens will be a  survivor, or an acquisition, he shrugs. ""Inde pendence isn't important.""  A FATHER'S ADVICE  Independence was  important  to Stuzin's  late father, David. An accountant by trade,  he moved from New York City  to South  Florida and becatne a bank auditor.  ""He  realized  there weren't  that many  S&Ls, and  there were none  in Hialeah,""  says his widow, Ruth. Stuzin got his federal  charter in 1952, setting up shop in Hialeah.  ""At that  time, building was beginning to  boom,""  recalls Ruth Stuzin.  ""He  always  said, 'Don't forget the purpose of the busi ness: hotne loans.' ""  The family still owns 44 percent of the  company.  The younger Stuzin was interested in the  business. Dad decided he should  learn  it  from the ground floor. ""I started when I  was 15 as a teller,"" says Charles Stuzin. ""I  worked in every department. That's how I  learned the basics.""  An accounting degree from the University  of Florida polished his numbers knowledge.  A law degree, with a specialty in real estate,  gave him insight into home lending.  DEREGULATION STRATEGIES  But nothing could have prepared him for  the thrift industry crisis of the mid-1980s,  Stuzin says. In the early 1980s, market con ditions  forced S&Ls  to pay high  interest  rates on deposits while  they earned  low  yields  on  fixed-rate  mortgages.  Losses  ensued.  Citizens survived, but a fourth of Florida's  S&Ls didn't.  In the mid-1980s, empowered by deregula tion, many S&Ls voluntarily bid up rates on  deposits because they could now pump the  deposit money  into high-interest commer cial loans rather than mortgages.  The  problem: High-interest  loans  made to less creditworthy customers.  Citizens saw disaster looming. ""The indus try was paying  too much  for deposits,""  Stuzin said. ""That means you've got to get  higher rates on your loans to earn a profit.  And that means you have to make riskier  loans.''  The dilemma: Citizens couldn't afford to  bid for deposits, but it couldn't afford not  to. No thrift can survive without new depos its.  are  A SHIFT TO INVESTORS  With regulators' blessings, Stuzin found a  solution. Rather than take money in from  consumers, he turned to investors. He sold  notes  and  short-term  commercial  paper  backed by letters of credit from the Federal  Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. Safety-seeking  investors snapped up $400 million worth.  ""We were the first in the Southeast to do  these things,"" says Stuzin. ""It kept our cost  of funds normal.''  ",1990
23,Senate,101,0.262,284,1,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, it was  my profound pleasure to be among the  guests invited to the inauguration of  L. Douglas Wilder as Governor of the  Commonwealth of Virginia on Satur day, January 13.  That gathering was, indeed a histor ic occasion in the history of my State  in The History of the American politi cal system. All who attended the cere mony  were  moved  by  Governor  Wilder's remarks.  I was particularly impressed by the  Governor's  pledge  to  demonstrate  during the next 4 years that he will be  beholden to but one special interest:  The welfare of Virginians, all Virgin ians.  I  wish Governor Wilder  success  during his tenure. For, as I  told him  that day, to the extent he succeeds, all  Virginians succeed.  Mr. President, it is my pleasure to  ask unanimous consent that the text  of Governor Wilder's excellent inaugu ral address be printed in the RECORD at  the conclusion of Senator ROBB'S re marks.  ",1990
24,Senate,101,-0.2,284,1,Mr. ROBB.," Mr. President, it is with  a great deal of pleasure that I  join  with my  distinguished  senior  col league, Senator WARNER,  in  asking  that  the  remarks of Virginia's new  Governor on the occasion of his inau guration be included in the RECORD.  January 13, 1990, was a great day for  the Commonwealth of Virginia and for  the Nation. Much has been made of  the historic aspect of the event, and to  be sure that day marks an important  milestone  in  this Nation's progress.  But  I  see  the election of Lawrence  Douglas Wilder as the 66th Governor  of Virginia as the natural and logical  extension  of  Thomas  Jefferson's  notion of an aristocracy of merit, as  Virginians proved once again that we  look to the most qualified, most expe rienced individual to lead us.  Senator WARNER and I were present  as Governor Wilder delivered his inau gural address. We commend it to you  for its reflection of the sweep of histo ry which led to the particular moment  and its appreciation of the challenges  that Virginia and the Nation face as  the 20th century comes to a close. I  am  happy  to  join with  Senator  WARNER in asking that it be reprinted  in the RECORD.  EXHIBIT No. 1  TEXT OF GOVERNOR WILDER'S INAUGURAL  ADDRESS DELIVERED AT THE CAPITOL  <Following is the text of Gov. L. Douglas  Wilder's inaugural address>  Mr. Justice Powell, Mr. Justice Carrico, to  the  lieutenant governor,  to  the attorney  general, members of the General Assembly,  distinguished  guests,  family  and  friends,  and my fellow Viginians, we gather here  today for what is both a culmination and a  continuation of the democratic process.  Four years ago,  I stood on this spot to  assume  the second highest office  in  the  commonwealth. Today,  because  of  your  faith in our efforts, I stand before you as  chief executive of this state. And now-in  keeping with  the sanctioned privilege ex tended to all governors-it is my honor to  address the people of this commonwealth,  and to express to my fellow citizens the pro found gratitude and deep sense of purpose  that I feel in fulfilling your expectations.  Candor and honesty would have me admit  to you that I was not blessed with the fore sight to know that this moment was in the  offing when I stood here in 1985. Having  been tested in the political crucible of trial  and cross-examination,  I  have been  ren dered a verdict by having had delivered unto  me the greatest outpouring of votes ever ac corded any candidate for this great office.  For that, I shall be eternally grateful. And be assured-I shall demonstrate that grati tude during the next four years by being a  governor who will be beholden to but one  special interest: the welfare of Virginians,  all Virginians.  ""THE BEST OF MY ABILITIES""  But my gratitude  is not of such recent  origin. It is said ""To whom much is given,  much shall be expected."" I will be the first  to admit that I have been the beneficiary of  much  through no endeavors of my own.  While I have indeed worked hard and per formed to the best of my abilities, I have  also had a few breaks along the way.  Indeed in every walk-in every period of  my life-there have been many more deserv ing and  justly entitled to  the fruits  that  wholesome opportunities present. And yet,  for many, those chances never came and the  bell of fulfillment never  tolled for  them.  Providence indeed has directed my course.  And I shall remain ever mindful of my good  fortune.  In recent years, Virginia  too has been  blessed with good fortune. The progress and  the prosperity we have enjoyed during this  period has enabled us  to reclaim  the re spected achievements of times past.  In looking to our accomplishments in edu cation, economic development, the environ ment, employment, housing or transporta tion, we  find  that Virginia  ranks among  those states  in  the vanguard of  forward  looking movement. Not surprisingly, the en suing pride in seeing our state climb in rank  among our sister states in the nation and in  preeminence among  the Southern states,  cause Virginians everywhere  to  feel good  about our cause, our mission, and our suc cess in forging Virginia's New Mainstream.  COMMITMENT TO LOOK AHEAD  That commitment to looking ahead and  not behind-of building  rather  than destroying; of bringing people together rather  than pitting them against each other-also  calls for me to address you with measured  sobriety in facing conditions in the common wealth today, and I will comment further in  that regard when I address the General As sembly on Monday.  But for this moment, let me assure you  that I do not intend to participate in bring ing  to  a  halt  the momentum  to which  people of Virginia have grown accustomed,  supported and enjoyed.  Cicero in parting observation, noted that,  ""A commonwealth is not any collection of  human  beings ... but  an  assembly  of  people joined in agreement on justice and  partnership for  the common good, and a  community where civility must reign and all  must  live  peacefully  together."" And we  know what happened  to Cicero's Rome  which could not pass on the heritage of its  past to the people of its future. But we have  done so; we can do so. And we shall do so.  There are times when the people of our  state and of our country can feel the resur gence of the dominance of the  individual  spirit which proves daily to be unconquer able. Whirlwinds  of  rebellion  shake  all  shores where  tyranny once ruled, and we  are redeemed in our deeply held and treas ured beliefs in the development of the high  possibility of every individual who breathes  the sweetness of liberty's air.  At this time-and in the place where so  many great names in American history have  trod-we renew this celebration of freedom  in the full and certain knowledge that with  it comes great responsibility.  Without question, much tighter economic  times which loom in the days ahead will test  to the fullest our ability to make hard deci sions, to lead, and to govern.  INCREASED FREEDOM  But progress will be possible.  Opportunity can be expanded.  Freedom can be increased.  Resources employed in the past for the  finer things in life can be-and will have to  be-deployed for  the more serious of our  needs.  For we know that freedom is but a word  for  the man or woman who needs and  cannot find a job.  Freedom-as  it has been written-is  a  dream deferred when 'it ""Dries up  like a  raisin  in  the sun, and stinks  like  rotten  meat.""  Freedom is meaningless when a woman's  right to choose is regulated outside the dic tates of her own faith and conscience.  Freedom is impotent when there is intol erance to those who hold moral and politi cal beliefs different from our own.  Freedom  is  restricted when  labor and  management cannot reach agreements.  Freedom is impossible for the uneducated  who try to live in today's complex world.  Freedom is restrained for business and in dustry when our network of transportation  is allowed to deteriorate.  Freedom for  the police  is denied when  their resources are unduly limited.  Freedom for the people is assaulted when  lawful authority is abused.  Freedom for the next generation is mort gaged when we destroy our environment.  And-as has been proven throughout re corded history-freedom is nowhere to be  found when the people are overtaxed and  overregulated.  As we salute the idea of freedom today, let  us pledge to extend that same freedom to  others tomorrow.  ",1990

26,Senate,101,-0.319,362,1,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, I wish  to bring to the attention of my col leagues an article on the sugar indus try which appeared in the December I  January issue of Farmline, a U.S. De partment of Agriculture publication of  the Economic Research Service. We so  frequently read attacks on the sugar  program from both within and outside  our Government by people who have  very limited knowledge of the program  and the industry. It is indeed refresh ing to find a balanced and informative  article from an authoritative source.  As you know, the 1990 farm bill will  be before us this year. The sugar pro gram is an essential part of the farm  bill and I am confident that your un derstanding of the need for and the  merits of  that program will be en hanced by  reading  this article. Mr.  President, I hereby request that it be  placed in the RECORD.  The article follows:  [From Farmline, December 1989-January  1990]  SUGAR PRODUCERS, USERS COULD GAIN A  FAIRER MARKETPLACE  Trade barriers that have long protected  the sugar  industry worldwide and  in  the  United States are being reevaluated, both in  the U.S. Congress and in the 97-nation Gen eral Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  CGATT). The outcome may  be  a  freer  market for the heavily traded commodity.  Sugar, produced in about 100 countries, is  one of the world's most traded and protect ed  food commodities, says economist An nette Clauson of USDA's Economic Re search Service. Sugar  is an  ingredient  in  most food items and plans an essential role  in the food chain. It is also an important  source of revenue to most countries. There fore,  the concern  for, and protection of,  sugar is worldwide.  ""Most major  sugar-producing  countries  maintain more than one sugar policy to pro tect  their producers and consumers  from  market price fluctuations,"" says the econo mist. Such programs include domestic and  import price controls, export controls and  subsidies, minimum prices to farmers, and  production quotas. The current U.S. sugar  program  includes  import controls and  a  minimum price to producers.  ""Sugar, historically, has been one of the  most volatile of all commodity markets,""  says Clauson. For example, monthly world  raw sugar prices have ranged from 2. 7 cents  to 41.1 cents per pound in the 1980's. ""When  supplies are low, prices rise sharply, impact ing consumers. Conversely, when supplies  are high, prices are severely depressed, im pacting producers. One factor that cannot  be controlled is the weather, making har vested acreage, yields, and sugar recovery  rates unpredictable from year to year,"" says  the economist.  ERS analysts say that quotas <restricted  imports> are necessary to protect domestic  sugar  producers  from  competition with  world sugar when prices are depressed. The  U.S. program maintains a domestic price for  raw sugar high enough to avoid defaults on  processors' Commodity Credit Corporation  c CCC) loans.  ""Only about a quarter of world sugar is  traded  in  international markets, and an  even smaller amount, about 15 percent, is  currently traded at world prices. This is an  important point, since many people believe  that unlimited quantities of sugar can be  bought at  the  'world price.'  In  reality,  world-priced sugar is a small uncommitted  amount that is sold for whatever price it  might bring,"" says Clauson.  Consumers pay the cost of world sugar  protection at different rates, depending on  where purchases are made. Little of  the  sugar traded in the world market is sold at  world market prices, says Clauson. Almost  all is sold at prices reflecting the domestic  sugar policies of the trading countries.  For example, according to a survey con ducted by U.S. agricultural attaches in 1988,  sugar prices varied  significantly  in  each  country.  In Canada, where world market  sugar is available, the government provides  a guaranteed return to growers in the form  of income support payments. Retail prices  in Ottawa were  low, about 17  cents per  pound, although prices varied and averaged  29 cents a pound in other cities, according to  a Canadian  government  survey. At  the  other end of the spectrum, in Japan, which  has substantial duties, sugar sold at 89 cents  a pound. The U.S. maintains a price support  program protected by  import quotas, and  the price to consumers in 1988 averaged 38  cents per pound.  Sugar-exporting nations  have  criticized  the United States for maintaining its sugar import restrictions, including a formal chal lenge brought by Australia  through  the  GATT dispute settlement process against  the allegedly  improper  implementation of  U.S. import quotas. The European Commu nity also filed a complaint through the same  GATT process against the United States for  its use of the Section 22 authority of the  Agricultural Adjustment Act  of 1933  to  impose import restrictions on sugar-contain ing products.  IMPLICATIONS OF GA'IT PROPOSALS  GA TT negotiators have debated proposals  to restructure and decrease trade distorting  agricultural subsidies. In April 1989, GATT  negotiators reached framework agreement.  Clauson says that although no major issues  were resolved, the language appears flexible  and strong enough to suggest substantive  long-term  reductions  in  import barriers,  supports, and subsidies.  The framework agreement did not include  specific language on the level of reductions  or a schedule for such reductions. Since ag riculture will be one of the toughest resolu tion areas, says Clauson, trade negotiators  are expected to propose more specific inten tions by January 1, 1990. Trade negotiators  plan to discuss long-term reform proposals  and complete the negotiations by late No vember or early December 1990 in the Uru guay round.  Clauson points out that the language on  import access and support  levels  in  the  framework  agreement works within  the  scope of  its members' existing legislation,  and their existing rights and obligations as  members of GATT. For the short term the  language of the agreement ensures that:  ""Current domestic and export support and  protection levels are not exceeded, except as  required by current law.""  For the United States, the current 18-cent  per pound loan rate specified in the 1985  farm bill could not be increased and addi tional  protection measures  and  import  quota  restrictions  could  not  be  added,  except under existing legislation.  Clauson explains that the U.S. sugar pro gram offers nonrecourse loans for raw cane  sugar and refined beet sugar. A price objec tive, called the Market Stabilization Price,  and the quotas on imported sugar allow a  domestic price  to be maintained that en courages processors to redeem loan collater al, rather than to forfeit the sugar to the  federal government.  ""Participants shall be deemed  to be  in  compliance with this undertaking so long as  the access opportunities granted to individ ual products in 1989 and 1990 are not less  than those granted in 1987 and 1988.''  Clauson says the wording is unclear on  whether the intent is the maximum, mini mum, or some average. If some averaging  method is used, the U.S. raw /refined sugar  import quota levels in 1989 and 1990 would  not be reduced below  the combined 1987  level of 1.0 million short tons and the 1988  level of 1.06 million short tons. The escape  clause, ""within the scope of existing legisla tion,"" permits reduction of the import quota  level  if necessary  to avoid  forfeitures of  sugar to the CCC.  ""Support  prices  to  producers  are  not  raised above the level prevailing at the date  of this decision.""  This means that the 18-cent loan rate for  sugar cannot be increased in the short term.  Changes in support limitations and access  restrictions beyond 1990 will likely be dictat ed by the Uruguay round.  One of the changes in import quotas of  sugar committed to the United States was  announced in September 1989. The quota  ",1990
27,Senate,101,0.301,375,1,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President, I rise  today in support of S. 1046, the Merri mack River Study Act of 1989. Senate  approval of this bill will be a major  step in the direction of long-term pro tection for  this remarkable river re source, which begins in Franklin, NH,  at the confluence of the Pemigewasset  and Winnepesaukee Rivers and flows  southward into eastern Massachusetts  to the Atlantic Ocean. Passage of S.  1046 will be a major victory for the  communities who organized to protect  the river from encroaching develop ment. As part of a 2-year effort, the  Merrimack River Coordinating Com mittee. working with all local commu nities and the various interests, built a  consensus on the long-term protection  of the Merrimack. The legislation we  are considering today represents that  consensus. This measure has the sup port of Governor Gregg and all the  communities along the proposed study  segment.  I want to thank the Senate Energy  and Natural Resources Committee for  taking rapid action on this measure. I  would also like to express my apprecia tion for the work of the chairman and  ranking member of the Subcommittee  on Public Lands, Senators BUMPERS  and WALLOP.  I ask unanimous consent to have a  letter from the mayor of Concord, NH,  ",1990
28,House,101,0.377,427,1,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank my leader for yielding me the  time. I am going to vote to override  the  President's veto  today.  I  an nounced  that last week.  I  feel  that  Members do have a constitutional obli gation to do that.  I  am also going  to vote  for  the  motion of the gentleman from Illinois  CMr. MICHEL]. I want to explain brief ly why  I  think  it  is  reasonable  to  spend a week or two asking the Com mittee on Foreign Affairs and  the  Committee on Intelligence and other  committees to review things.  I found myself just as we prepared  to come back home and we were all  out around the country, we were look ing around and talking to people. As I  sat in Douglasville, GA, in Carrollton,  GA, in Jonesboro, GA, I had a chance  after Christmas to listen to people.  Then I said, now we are all going to  come to Washington. It suddenly oc curred  to me one afternoon, and  I  think this is an important thing for  Congress to realize, that the world had  changed dramatically  since we  left  here in November. Romania had lost  its dictatorship in an extraordinarily  bloody cycle of events. The Soviet  Empire changed substantially. The Az erbaijani rebellion all occurred since  then.  The  process  of  change  in  Panama had been decisive with an  American victory and a victory  for  freedom and against the drug dealers.  Place after place around the planet,  things changed.  In China there is a process going on.  I thought what could better illustrate  the willful ignorance of Congress than  to  rush  back  to Washington,  and  within 24 hours of arriving, decide  that it could not stop and investigate,  it could not have closed hearings to re ceive any testimony by the administra tion, it could not contemplate; but in stead, relying on newspaper reports,  relying on Christmas cards from Chi nese students, relying on the passions  of the moment as we remembered it  the day we left, when we voted.  There  is no question  in my mind  that the President has made a mis take. There is no question in my mind  that in fact if we are going to vote to  override the veto, it should be an over ride.  I  just found  it intriguing that we  had to schedule this the opening week  and that it had to be characterized by  some people as a partisan scheduling  on the part of the Democratic leader ship to score one on the President.  Let me just say two things in closing  about all this: In the first place, a man  with 80-percent approval can probably  be overridden and he will not be crip pled dramatically. He might shrink to  the levels of Roosevelt,  to the more  normal levels of Eisenhower and Roo sevelt. In the second place, we will not  dramatically change things.  I  just want  to note  for my col leagues, I hope the Democratic leader ship does not plan to start a whole  series of partisan snipings, of which  this week's schedule is an example. I  think it is regrettable that they pulled  the  resolution  on  Panama, which  should have been here and we under stood yesterday was going to be here. I  think that would have been bipartisan  and positive and the American people  would have supported it.  I think it is regrettable that it was  decided to schedule this, and that it  has been described so openly in the  press as a partisan effort.  So, Mr. Speaker, I am going to vote  for this motion on two grounds. First,  to send the signal that on an issue  that is still going to be relevant in 2  weeks, an issue where the President al ready personally by administrative fiat  has taken care of any concerns of the  students, has already protected them,  that it would not have been inappro priate for Congress to wait 2 weeks to  let  the committees  report. And  the  truth is the committees could not have  reported during  the previous period  because  they were not here. They  could not have gotten a quorum and  had a meeting.  Symbolically, first I think it is useful  for  the  legislature  to  try  to be  in formed occasionally, especially when  the world is changing as fast as it has  in the last 60 days.  Second, I want to send a message to  my friends in the Democratic leader ship. It is going to be a long season if  we get to petty partisanship, if we pull  a  resolution on Panama that should  have commended the President of the  United States, that should have ap plauded the men and women in uni form who did the right thing, if we  pull that and leave standing only a  veto override in the narrowest of parti san ways.  Mr. Speaker, I hope my friends on  the Republican side will vote for this  motion,  and  those Democrats who  think Congress should slow down and  take a look and get briefed occasional ly, they may want to vote this way too.

30,House,101,-0.213,427,1,Mr. JONES of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  in these past few months we have seen  historic images of change and courage  and hope. We have seen the image of  free people celebrating on the ruins of  the Berlin wall. We have seen, too, the  image of a young Chinese man facing  a convoy of tanks in an act of defiance  that spoke for all mankind. And we  have seen the darker image of Ameri can diplomats lifting a cynical toast to  the brutal Communist ideologues who  had crushed  the  life out of  their  brightest children.  Today we have the opportunity to  create another  image-as we,  repre senting the sentiment of a Nation, reaffirm through law the basic decency  of the American people, and the basic  fairness of our moral imperative. Let  us send a clear and simple marker  about the American character to the  butchers of Beijing.  In doing so, we will also send to free dom  loving people  throughout  the  world  an  unequivocal message: we  stand for human rights. Let us def eat  the motion to refer,  let us override  this unfortunate veto, and let us lift  no more toasts to tyrants.  0 1520  ",1990

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the motion which I  think is well in tended and I understand the minority  whip's proposition that we could take  2 weeks  to  look at  this. There  is,  though, I believe no one in this body  who believes that looking at this in 2  weeks would change  the opinion of  any Member of this body who repre sents the people of this country who  were outraged,  justifiably so, by the  events in Tiananmen Square.  I suggest to you that perhaps people  told Andrei Sakharov to wait, take 2  weeks  to  consider whether human  rights violations were worth standing  up against. Perhaps the people in Ru mania were told that as well.  Vaclav Havel, who spent 5 years in  prison  in Czechoslovakia,  I am sure  was told many times, ""wait.""  It is time to act now, it is time, with  a clear and I hope unanimous voice,  state to  those in China as we have  done over and over again, not on a par tisan fashion but together, the Soviet  Union and  the Communist bloc  in  Europe, ""We stand in united opposi tion to violations of human rights in  the Soviet Union.""  Indeed  our  President,  President  Reagan  said  that  the  then Soviet  Union at the time he said it was the  evil empire. It is perhaps China that  now stands most dramatically in that  position.  This is not a time to temporize, this  is not a time to delay, it is a time to  act. Let us speak with a strong voice  and override this misguided veto.  ",1990

The need for such legislation is ap parent given our Nation's projected  ""shortfall of 560,000 scientists and en gineers by the year 2010."" This short fall is aggravated by the underrepre sentation of minorities,  the  handi capped, and women in science, all of  whom will constitute, in the aggregate,  85 percent of the work force by the  year 2000.  [Washington Post, Jan. 9,  1990, p. Al 71  What we have, therefore, is a  two prong problem: On the one hand, we  currently don't have enough scientists  and engineers for research and devel opment purposes; and on  the other  hand, the future pool of working-age  Americans who could possibly fill that  gap have been traditionally underrep resented in those fields. To ensure our  Nation's economic competitiveness, it  is incumbent upon us as legislators to  find ways of increasing the representa tion of women and minorities in sci ence and engineering. This point  is  eloquently made by National Science  Director Erich Bloch who has stated  publicly that:  The  large  numbers of minorities  and  women in the country provide an opportuni ty-one we  cannot  afford  to miss. Our  motive should be pragmatism as much as al truism-the need to develop all our human  resources.  My own recognition of the relation  of minority education initiatives to our  Nation's economic  security  is what  prompted me to introduce, on March  22 of la.st year, H.R. 1561, The Hispan ic-Serving Institutions of Higher Edu cation Act of 1989. My distinguished  colleague  and  senior Senator  from  Texas, Finance Chairman LLOYD BENT SEN introduced the companion bill, S.  1669, on September 22 of  la.st year.  Senator BENTSEN and I introudced this  legislation because we believe that in  this age of constant technological ad vances and increasing global competi tion, our educational system is faced  with a tremendous challenge that the  Congress must help  that system  to  meet. That's one of the reasons why I  included  a  provision  in H.R.  1561  which would authorize postsecondary  institutions to increase the representa tion of Hispanic-Americans  in math,  science, and engineering, for although  ""Hispanics comprise 9 percent of the  population       only 2 percent of all  employed scientists and engineers"" are  Hispanic.  In fact, increasing representation of  Hispanic-Americans in these fields was  one of the specific strategies outlined  in a Federal report entitled-""Chang ing America: The New Face of Science  and Engineering.""  That was the title of the final report  of the task force on women, minori ties, and the handicapped in science  and technology, which was statutorily  established during the 99th Congress  for the purpose of issuing recommen dations on how to shore up our scarci ty of workers with scientific expertise.  The same task force  recommended  that the Federal Government take the  lead  in  launching programs  to help  the American education system to im prove math and science instruction:  The Federal Government  is  the  largest  single employer of scientists and engineers.  It finances one-half of all research and de velopment performed in the United States.  It has a special responsibility to be a pace setter.  By taking the lead in math and sci ence promotion, the Federal Govern ment would be indirectly encouraging  private  industry and State and local  government to do the same. Some of  ",1990

Mr. Parrell is retir ing after 16 years at  the Wilkes-Barre VA  Medical Center and has worked with the Vet erans' Administration, now Department of Vet erans Affairs, for the past 34 years.  Mr. Parrell began serving our area veterans  on March 31, 197 4. He has overseen the op erations of a 405-bed medical facility, two sat ellite outpatient clinics, and a 120-bed nursing  home. The Wilkes-Barre Veterans' Administra tion Medical Center provides care to veterans  living in 19 counties in Pennsylvania, 3 in New  York, and 2 in New Jersey. As director, Mr.  Parrell was responsible  for  the management  of all resources necessary to serve the veter an population serviced by these facilities.  A northeastern Pennsylvania native son, Mi chael Parrell was born  in Hazleton, PA and  graduated from Hazelton High School. He at tended  George Washington  University  in  Washington, DC, and served  in  the military  from December 1942 to December 1945 with  the Army Corps of Engineers.  From 1946 until 1951, Mr. Perrell worked in  the insurance division of the VA district office  in Philadelphia, PA. He began as an underwrit er training officer, became assistant chief of  the underwriting section and supervisor of the  underwriting unit, and finally held the position  of administrative assistant of the underwriting  section.  Mr. Perrell worked with the VA department  of  insurance  in  the Washington, DC central  office from 1951 until 1963. In this department  he served in a number of capacities including  methods  examiner,  management  analyst,  senior evaluation  survey officer, evaluation  staff chief, and executive assistant to depart ment head.  In July of 1963, he became the  executive assistant  to  the director of  insur ance service  in  the department of veterans  benefits.  In 1964, Mr. Perrell began working with the  department of data management  in  the VA  central office. He served as associate director  of systems operations service, executive as sistant to the department head, and as direc tor of planning and budget staff.  Prior to becoming director of the VA Medi cal Center in Wilkes-Barre, Mr. Parrell served  in a hospital administrative trainee position at  the VA Hospital in Washington, DC.  Mr. Michael Perrell has dedicated his  life  not only to the veterans of the 11th Congres sional District but  to  veterans across  the  country.

EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  HAVEL'S NEW YEAR'S ADDRESS  TO THE NATION  HON. JOHN J. LaF ALCE  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 24, 1990  ",1990
53,,101,-0.357,479,1,Mr. LAFALCE.," Mr. Speaker, 2 months ago  Lech Walesa, in addressing a joint session of  Congress, began his remarks with the words,  ""We, the people."" Those words, lifted as they  were from our Constitution, dramatically char acterized Poland's triumph of democracy.  Just 6 weeks later, another Eastern Europe an leader in another Eastern European coun try,  echoed  similar  sentiments,  telling  his  people about his dreams from ""a republic of  the people,  [and] which serves the people.""  That man was Vaclav Havel, The country was  Czechoslovakia. The occasion was his New  Year's address.  Recently,  I led a congressional delegation  to central Europe, and had  the great honor  and  privilege  of meeting and  talking with  President Havel.  I would like to take this op portunity to share his New Year's message to  the  people of Czechoslovakia,  one which  could aptly serve as a timeless message for  the freedom-loving people of all nations.  HAVEL NEW YEAR'S ADDRESS TO NATION  Dear fellow citizens. For the past 40 years  on this day you have heard my predecessors  utter  different  variations  on  the  same  theme, about how our country is prospering,  how many more billion tonnes of steel we  have produced, how happy we all are, how  much we trust our government, and what  beautiful prospects lie ahead of us. I do not  think you appointed me to this office for  me, of all people, to lie to you.  Our country is not prospering. The great  creative  and  spiritual  potential  of  our  nation is not being used to its full potential.  Whole sectors of  industry are producing  things in which no one is interested, while  the things we need are in short supply.  The state, which calls itself a state of the  working people, is humiliating and exploit ing the workers. Our outdated economy is  squandering energy, of which we are  in  short supply. A country which could once be  proud of the standard of education of its  people spends so  little on education that  today it occupies 72d place in the world. We  have laid waste and soiled the rivers and the  forests that our forefathers bequethed to  us, and we have the worst environment in  the whole of Europe today. Adults in our  country die earlier than in most other Euro pean countries.  Allow me to tell you about a little person al experience of mine. Flying to Bratislava  recently, I found time during various meet ings to look out of the window. What I saw  was the Slovnaft Coil refinery] complex and  the Petrzalka suburb  immediately beyond  it. That view was enough for me to under stand  that our statesmen and politicians  had not even looked, or did not even want to  look out of the windows of their planes.  None of the statistics available to me would  have enabled me to understand more quick ly or more easily  the situation we have  gotten overselves into.  But not even all of that is the most impor tant thing. The worst thing is that we are  living in a decayed moral environment. We  have become morally  ill, because we have  become accustomed to saying one thing and  477  thinking another. We have learned not to  believe in anything, not to have consider ation for one another, and only to look after  ourselves. Notions such as love, friendship,  compassion, humility, and forgiveness have  lost  their depth and dimension, and  for  many of us they merely represent some kind  of psychological idiosyncrasy, or appear to  be some kind of stray relic from times past,  something rather comical in the era of com puters and space rockets. Few of us man aged to cry out that the powerful should  not be all-powerful, and that the special  farms which produce ecologically sound and  high-""quality  foodstuffs  for  them  should  send their produce to the schools, children's  hostels, and hospitals, since our agriculture  is not yet able to offer this to everyone.  The previous regime, armed with its arro gant and  intolerant  ideology,  denigrated  man into a production force and nature into  a production tool. In this way it attacked  their very essence and the relationship be tween them. It made talented people who  were capable of managing their own affairs  and making an enterprising living in their  own country into cogs in some kind of mon strous, ramshackle, smelly machine whose  purpose no one can understand. It can do  nothing more than slowly but surely wear  itself down, and all the cogs in it.  When I talk about a decayed moral envi ronment, I do not mean merely those gen tlemen who eat ecologically pure vegetables  and do not look out of their airplane win dows. I mean all of us, because all of us have  become  accustomed  to  the  totalitarian  system, accepted it as an unalterable fact,  and thereby kept it running. In other words,  all of us are responsible, each to a different  degree, for keeping the totalitarian machine  running. None of us is merely a victim of it,  because all of us helped to create it togeth er.  Why do I mention this? It would be very  unwise to see the sad legacy of the past 40  years as something alien to us, handed down  to us by some distant relatives. On the con trary, we must accept this legacy as some thing which we have brought upon our selves. If we can accept this, then we will  understand that it is up to all of us to do  something about it. We cannot lay all the  blame on those who ruled us before, not  only because this would not be true, but also  because it could detract from the responsi bility each of us now faces-the responsibil ity to act on our own initiative, freely, sensi bly and quickly.  Let us not delude ourselves: not even the  best government,  the best parliament, or  the best president can do much on their  own, and it would be profoundly unjust to  expect them alone to put everythillg right.  Freedom and democracy, after all, mean  that we all have a part to play and bear  joint responsibility. If we can realize this,  then all the horrors which the new Czecho slovak democracy has inherited will sudden ly cease to appear too terrible. If we can re alize this, hope will return to our hearts.  In putting right the general state of af fairs, we already have a sound footing on  which to build. The recent times, and espe cially the last 6 weeks of our peaceful revo lution, have shown what an enormous gen erally humane, moral, and spiritual charge  and what high standards of civic maturity  lay dormant in our society under the mask  of apathy that had been forced upon  it.  Whenever anyone talking to me began to  put  categorical  labels  on  our people,  I  always pointed out that society  is a very  mysterious creature, and that it  is never  ",1990
54,,101,-0.225,492,1,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, I offer my  best wishes  to Frances Hesselbein as she  leaves her post as the National Executive Di rector of Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. this month.  As a former Girl Scout myself, I have a deep  affection for the program.  Mrs. Hesselbein led the Girl Scouts for the  past  13  years,  and  saw  the  organization  through many changes. She has worked to in crease membership  throughout  the eighties,  including dramatic  increases  in  racial/ ethnic  minorities.  She  is  an  excellent manager,  leader and is unsurpassed in her dedication to  community service.  Mrs. Hesselbein has been an excellent role  model for the youth of America. She worked  to change their lives for the better, and to pro vide equal access for all to her dream. She fo cused on each individual to help them attain  their own potential and be the best they could  be.   Mrs. Hesselbein's contribution to the educa tion of our youth will always be remembered,  and although she will be missed, she will for ever be a part of the Girl Scouts, and I would  like to thank her for all the effort and good will  she has put into shaping the future of the Girl  Scouts, and the youth of America.

55,,101,-0.044,492,1,Mr. GREEN.," Mr. Speaker, as a Member of  Congress privileged to represent Chinatown in  New York City, I should like to announce that  Saturday, January 27, marks the beginning of  the Chinese New Year. The Chinese year  4688  is  the Year of the Horse, a totem of  stamina, speed, and reliability.  The Chinese New Year season is a time of  kindness and goodwill to all, and a time of for giveness and reconciliation. It is celebrated on  the first day of the first month of the lunar cal endar. The celebration lasts several days, be ginning with  family observances and ending  with gala festivities. For the Chinese,  it is a  time of closing the business of the old year,  clearing debts, and cleaning house.  The Chinese community is a source of im mense pride  to our city, and  their culture  brings enrichment  to  the  lives of all New  Yorkers. I am proud to celebrate with them at  this special time and wish them a very happy  new year.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  January 24, 1990  ""FIXING"" THE NOTCH  HON. CASS BALLENGER  OF NORTH CAROLINA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 24, 1990  ",1990
56,,101,0.464,492,1,Mr. BALLENGER.," Mr. Speaker, the Social  Security ""notch"" continues to be an issue that  causes concern and misunderstanding among  senior citizens. The most misunderstood point  of all, however,  is  that  legislation  to  fix  the  notch will actually be given serious consider ation.  While many Members are eager to sponsor  proposed fixes, few are willing to actually put  this measure to an up-or-down vote. The lead ership of the House, by refusing to bring this  measure  before Congress,  protects  those  Members who seek to gain political mileage  from their sponsorship of legislation. In public,  sponsors can pretend  to support ""fixing  the  notch,"" while knowing full well the legislation  will never come to a vote in the House.  In the 1 OOth Congress, I signed a discharge  petition calling for a vote on notch legislation.  I have again signed a discharge petition this  Congress. It is time to take this matter off the  back burner and subject it to full and vigorous  debate,  resolving  the so-called notch  issue  once and  for all.  I urge  the cosponsors of  notch  legislation  to  join me and others  to  force a vote on this issue.  DORIS MORTON, A ""WE THE  PEOPLE ... "" LEADER  HON. WILLIAM H.

57,,101,-0.288,492,1,Mr. NATCHER.," Mr. Speaker, we must not  neglect  to pass on  to our youth  the under standing of  the  fundamental principles and  values of our democratic institutions that leads  to a reasoned commitment to their preserva tion and  improvement. The events that have  occurred around  the world during  the past  several weeks makes  this more  important  than ever.  I am pleased to commend the efforts of one  of our educational leaders in my congression al district whose dedication  to  the  improve ment of the civic education of our students  has been exemplary. Through  the dedicated  and voluntary efforts of Doris Morton,  thou sands of our students have participated  in a  program designated as ""We the People . . .  Bicentennial Programs on the Constitution and  Bill of Rights."" This curriculum introduces stu dents to the philosophical ideas of our found ers, the historical background of the Philadel phia Convention, and the issues and debates  that shaped the writing of our Constitution. In  this program, students learn how our Govern ment  is organized and how  it protects  the  rights and liberties of all citizens. Finally, and  most important, students learn of the respon sibilities which accompany  the rights of citi zenship in a democracy.  It is a pleasure for me to express my admi ration and appreciation to Doris Morton for her  impressive contributions  to  the development  of competent and responsible citizenship.  INTRODUCTION  OF  A  JOINT  RESOLUTION  DESIGNATING  ""NATIONAL WATER  RECREA TION SAFETY WEEK""  HON. JOHN J. RHODES Ill  OF ARIZONA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 24, 1990  ",1990
58,,101,0.407,492,1,Mr. RHODES.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing a  joint  resolution designating  the  week of May 20, 1990, through May 26, 1990,  as ""National Water Recreation Safety Week.""  This resolution is inspired by the drowning  death of one of my constituents, K.C. John son, of Mesa, AZ. He died in a boating acci dent on an Arizona  lake. This  senseless,  needless accident caused his family to estab lish the K.C. Johnson Memorial Foundation to  assist families whose loved ones have died in  drowning accidents. The foundation also pro vides public education regarding the dangers  of water-based recreation and safeguards that  should be taken in our recreational waters.  Drowning  is  the second  leading cause of  accidental deaths of persons 5  through 44  years of age  in America. Alcohol and drugs  are involved in 2 out of 3 of those accidents.  The highest drowning rates occur among chil dren under 5 years of age. On average, 1,200  deaths occur each year in the United States  as a result of boating accidents.  These are preventable accidents that need lessly claim  the  lives of our children and  young adults. This resolution will help increase  public attention  to  the dangers as we ap proach the peak water recreation season this  coming summer.  I invite all of you  to  join in  cosponsoring this legislation to help carry out  the education and public awareness work of  the K.C. Johnson Memorial Foundation,  the  National Water Safety Congress and similar  organizations across the country.  SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS  Title  IV of Senate Resolution 4,  agreed to by the Senate on February  4, 1977, calls for establishment of a  system for a computerized schedule of  all meetings and hearings of Senate  committees, subcommittees, joint com mittees, and committees of conference.  This title requires all such committees  to notify  the Office of  the Senate  Daily Digest-designated by the Rules  Committee-of  the  time, place, and  purpose of the meetings, when sched uled, and any cancellations or changes  in the meetings as they occur.  As  an additional procedure along  with the computerization of this inf or mation, the Office of the Senate Daily  Digest will prepare  this  information  for printing in the Extensions of Re marks section of the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD on Monday and Wednesday of  each week.  Any changes in committee schedul ing will be indicated by placement of  an asterisk to the left of the name of  the unit conducting such meetings.  ",1990

60,Senate,101,0.322,518,1,Mr. SIMPSON.," Under the direction  of the President of the United States,  nothing is going to happen to the Chi nese students. So if we can start with  that basic premise maybe we can get  something resolved.  George Bush was our Nation's Am bassador to the People's Republic of  China for a year and a half. He knows  the players. He knows who is in favor.  Who is not in favor. He knows who the  hardliners are, the conservatives, the  imperialists. He knows the moderates.  He knows those who want change in  their country, and he knows them by  name. He knows more about China  than anyone in this body, bar none, on  either side of the aisle. Let us keep  that in context.  And you know  if we are going  to  come into this cooking on all boilers I  can do that, too. I did a little of that  yesterday. I was severely reprimanded.  However, it seemed appropriate at the  time because we were  talking about  partisanship. I said, you know, there is  a partisan tinge to this, and do not let  anybody miss it.  First, I do not think it comes from  the fine sponsor in the House, NANCY  PELOSI. I think she is very sincere and,  in essence, a progressive person trying  to do her very best for a remarkable  constituency. But, as we  say, when  they had their visit up in Harvard on  January 3 and 5, she fell in with evil  companions because up there at that  little session was John Sasso, who is  the  fellow  that personally cut  JoE  BrnEN's bicycle tire, and he is an indi vidual who is a raw partisan.  She was there in the best interests  of her constituency. Senator KENNE DY'S person was there. Also there were  Congressman GEPHARDT's person, Con gressman BARTON'S person, or maybe  the Congressman himself. It was a bi partisan group. Also  there was Rick  Schwartz, who is an advocate of any thing that has  to do with opposing  anything in our immigration or refu gee policies that are at least sensible.  It was called a group to plan strate gy  to override  the President's veto.  That is what it was and what they met  for. They did not meet  in a  social  event on  the banks of  the Charles  River at Cambridge. That is that. I be lieve Congresswoman PELOSI when she  tells me that she did not sense a severe  partisan tinge to this.  But after hearing Senator DIXON I  am reminded of that old story of the  woman of the WCTU,  the Women's  Christian Temperance Union gaining  force in the thirties promoting prohi bition. She was railing and exhorting,  bringing down the fire, the brimstone,  and the terror from the cliffs, heavy  stuff, on the evils of booze and the  degradation, depravation  and  ruina tion of the family with the grain and  the grape and how they had led to the  grave. She said ""Our Lord would never  have stood for it."" The guy in the back  loosely composing himself, his breath  familiar to all around him, said, ""How  about that time when He turned water  into wine down there at the wedding  in Cana?""  Well, she drew herself  to her full  proportion and she said, ""I'd thought  more of Him if He hadn't done it.""  I think I sense that here. ""I would  have  thought a whole  lot more of  George Bush if he had not done it.""  But he did do  it, because he knew  what he was doing.  And why did he do it? I hope we can  get away from hearing too much more  about champagne toasts. That seemed  to trigger a lot of glands in the United  States. Somebody ought  to  talk  to  Brent Scowcroft  and  get,  as Paul  Harvey said, ""the rest of the story.""  Why did Scowcroft go on a secret  mission  to  the People's Republic of  China? Because if he had gone public ly they would have repudiated him to tally.  I  thought George Bush, our  fine  President, expressed it beautifully yes terday when he said, ""What would you  think would have happened if I called  the fine majority leader,"" who accused  the President of kowtowing.  I  think  our fine majority leader has stepped  up his gunfire. If he wishes to do that  we have a lot of people to return the  f µsillade  over here. We have  some  skilled people  to do  that well.  I am  surprised at the renewed partisanship  and intensity of our majority leader.  He  threw another gratuitous shot  into  the game  this morning,  some thing about George Bush seeing the  light on the EPA Cabinet position. He  didn't know how he came about to re verse his position. He did that yester day.  If that is what we are in for we have  some remarkable cannoneers on this  side of the aisle. But he opened that  door and if that is what he wants to do  fine. He called it kowtowing.  What is the purpose of bringing this  up on the first and second day when  we come back if it is not partisanship?  Somebody please  tell me.  I want to  hear that, and I know I will hear it in  the debate. We can wait 2 months and  find out what happened,  and  in 2  months  if nothing happens then we  can do it to him in spades.  Let us review why Scowcroft went to  the People's Republic of China. He  went secretly. And what George Bush  said yesterday I think is so important.  He said, ""What if I had gathered the  majority leader, and the other Mem bers of their party together and said  weeks ago, what would you think if I  send somebody secretly to China, and  if I did that we might get them to lift  martial law? We might get them to re""It is  lease and give amnesty to 561 people.  We might be able  to get the Peace ~  Corps back underway in that country,  those remarkable carriers of democra cy? We also  then would reopen the  Fulbright  programs  and  other  ex change programs. What would you  think, should I do that?""  I bet you from my 10 years of know ing the majority leader and the assist ant majority leader and others in that  party  they would have  said,  worth the risk, Mr. President; try it.""  I think all of us in this Chamber will  admit that that is the way that would  have been handled. And I think any body would honestly  say  the same  thing.  So he did it and then this drumfire  of patter because it looks good, it looks  very good for a free swing at the Presi dent and his policy. This is a freebie;  you cannot lose a nickel on this one.  So Brent Scowcroft went, and he  went so he could give them the busi ness, and he went  to  tell  them the  President of  the Vnited States was  trying to be reasonable, diplomatic that being his nature as a diplomat and  that when  the Congress  came  back into session they were going to do  a number on the Chinese Government.  Brent Scowcroft told them, ""And the  Congress will do a tremendous number  on you, and if you do not believe it,  you are lost in the swamps.""  That is what he told them. He said,  ""We  are  repulsed  and  revulsed by  what you did in Tiananmen Square.""  That is what he told them.  And amidst all the clinking glasses  somebody  left out a very  important  part of the speech, where he said, and  you can get a copy of that if anyone  cares  to do  that, ""It would not be  honest of me to come here if I did not  tell you that we have profound areas  of  disagreement.  Your  complaints  against us in your official organs are  repugnant to us. And it is not what  the administration did to you that is  causing you pain. It is what the Con gress  is doing to you that is causing  you your pain and you are going to get  it in spades.""  That is what he told them.  So, we have the reason it is just a cu rious debate is that we have a mixture  here, and we do not seek purity over  here, but I can tell you this, we have  people who feel very strongly on our  side of the aisle that this is an oppor tunity  for  those who  still  believe  deeply  in  the  transgressions of Red  China, that is deep in their bosom, our  strategy with regard to Taiwan and its  recognition,  that  is  there  in  their  bosom, very real.  There are some who look upon this  as  the greatest opportunity of out reach into the Asian community and  the Asian fundraising community that  we would ever know, a new part of  Fort Knox. I understand that. There  ",1990

62,,101,-0.355,544,1,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to urge my colleagues to join in  overriding the President's veto of H.R.  2712,  the  Chinese Adjustment  of  Status Facilitation Act.  Last  summer,  the world watched  with respect and admiration as Chi nese students staged a peaceful pro de mocracy rally in Tiananmen Square.  The world watched in awe as a  lone  student-armed only with moral cour age-stood in front a tank and brought  the military might of  a  repressive  regime to a halt.  Later, we watched with horror as  the tyrants who rule China ruthlessly  crushed the students' cry for freedom.  We now know that only weeks after  that night in Tiannanmen Square, our  National  Security  Adviser,  Brent  Scowcroft,  secretly met with  those  same  tyrannical  rulers. And only 2  months ago,  just as the walls of re pression were coming down in Eastern  Europe, we watched the National Se curity Advisor of  the United States  raise a glass to toast the Chinese lead ers whose own repressive tactics stand  in stark contrast to the wave of free dom  and  democracy  sweeping  the  world. Those visits-and  this veto send  the message  that  the United  States values friendship over freedom.  The President's inadvised veto puts  Chinese students here in the United  States  in grave danger and  it puts  their families  in China in danger as  well.  The President's proposal to handle  this  issue  through  administrative  means is simply insufficient. In fact, it  puts the students in more danger. The  students believe that to be the case.  First of all, it rests on shaky legal  ground. A recent Library of Congress  legal analysis concludes that-in the  absence  of  specific  legislation-the  President may not have the legal au thority  to  impose his administrative  remedy.  Second, it requires Chinese students  here in the United States to apply for  an extension of their visas. The Chi nese Government regards such an act  as a rejection of Chinese citizenship in fact as an act of treason. The Chi nese Government has already contact ed students warning them not to apply  for the President's program.  I believe we owe these brave young  students better than that.  The  legislation we are considering  today will off er  real protections  to  Chinese students. First, it waives the  2-year  home  country  residence  re quirement for nationals of  the Peo ple's Rebublic of China. Thus,  stu dents who have demonstrated for free dom can apply for  residency  in the  United States without  returning  to  China.  Second, it presumes continuous U.S.  residence for the purpose of status ad justment or changes of status for stu dents who were in lawful nonimmigra tion status as of June 5, 1989.  Third,  it allows Chinese  students  lawfully in the United States on stu dent and exchange visas to work, to  make a living.  Mr. President, this is real protection  for the students. This is real security  for them. And by giving them auto matic coverage they will not have to  take any individual actions which will  endanger their families in China.  Mr. President,  the model  the stu dents chose for their rally was one of  the most inspiring symbols of Ameri can freedom-the Statue of Liberty.  The President's veto of H.R. 2712 flies  in the very face of everything that  statue stands for.  At the foot of the Statue of Liberty  lies a broken chain which represents  tyranny. What lies at the foot of the  President's veto is the broken hopes of  these Chinese students in the United  States who so bravely demonstrated  for an end to tyranny in their home land.  Mr. President, we  should override  this veto. Not to do so is to send a mes sage to the Chinese Government that  repression  is acceptable. That is  the  message President Bush wants to send.  It is the wrong message.  ",1990
63,,101,0.322,544,1,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr.  President,  I  yield 3 minutes' time to the Senator  from Texas [Mr. GRAMM].  ",1990
64,,101,0.551,544,1,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, what is  at issue is not whether these students  are going to be sent back into an op pressive country to face punishment  from a totalitarian government. Both  our actions and the President's actions  have guaranteed that the students are  not going to be sent back against their  will.  Quite frankly, Mr. President, I am  delighted the students are here. I want  to see more come. If things should  turn out so they should decide not to  go back, we are  talking about over  40,000 people, the smartest people in  China. And if that intelligence is com bined with the ingredient that Amer ica provides best-freedom-I have no  doubt that there are Noble Prize win ners in this group of students, I have  no doubt  that  they can contribute  greatly to America and to the world. I  look forward to that contribution.  What is at issue here is not are the  students going to be sent back. Wheth er we override the veto or whether we  do not, they will not be sent back and  we all know that. What is at issue here  is whether we are going to make the  decision or whether we are going to  allow the President to make it.  I  think it is  interesting, Mr. Presi dent,  that 30 years ago  this debate  probably would never have occurred.  If President Eisenhower had picked up  the  telephone and called Sam Ray burn and Lyndon Johnson and said, ""I  know there is concern about the stu dents; I want to assure you they are  not going to be sent back; I am going  to issue an Executive order; I believe,  based on my experience with dealing  with the Chinese, that that is the best  way to do it,"" my belief is-and I think  history, if we  look back at it, would  probably indicate that I am correct that Speaker Rayburn and Majority  Leader  Johnson would  have  said,  ""That is fine with us, Mr. President, if  that is what you think is best.""  What we have seen, as we all know,  is  that partisanship has not died at  the Nation's shores, and we have a  continuing attempt  in Congress  for  each of us to play as if we are Presi dent. I am swayed by the President's  opinion. I personally do not agree. My  guess is,  if I were President, I would  sign this bill. If I were President, I  ",1990
65,Senate,101,-0.313,557,1,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, I am  voting to override the President's veto  of H.R. 2712, a bill to allow Chinese  students  to  remain  in  the United  States rather  than be sent back  to  China to suffer intimidation and per secution by a repressive regime.  For me, this is not simply a vote on  the Pelosi bill. This  is a vote on a  policy that is ineffective, and against  the broader  interests of  the United  States.  The President has based his China  policy on the mistaken and dangerous  assumption  that the present  leader ship, President Yang Shangkun and  Premier Li Peng, are proreform. They  are not. They are antiref orm. And  they are weak and unstable to boot. It  is not in our interest to legitimize this  regime any more than it is in the in terests of the long-suffering Chinese  people. The President apparently does  not understand this. Instead, he sends  virtually the highest ranking officials  in the Government on a secret mission  to Beijing. He vetoes the Pelosi bill.  He creates an atmosphere where those  with real claim to asylum are shunned.  Where NED money for some modest,  legitimate prodemocracy activities  is  blocked. And he signals to our allies  that a resumption of military sales or  ""business as usual"" is fine.  What has he received in return? A  so-called lifting of martial law in Tian anmen. A visa for a new VOA corre spondent. A promise to begin discus sions on the resumption of the Ful bright Program. And, most recently,  the announced release of 573 people  who  had  been  arrested  since  the  events in June-of more than 10,000  thrown in jail. That is an average of 80  released each month-at which rate it  would take more than 10 years to re lease all those now held. This, it seems  to me, is a meager return for the blow  the President has dealt to the legiti mate  aspirations  of  the  Chinese  people.  The President is backing the Beijing  government, not the Chinese people.  In doing so, he is backing the wrong  horse. The demonstrations in Beijing  last spring showed the regime's lack of  legitimacy. And the unforgiveable use  of force against those peaceful demon strators showed that the regime knows  this. When events in Eastern Europe  resonate among the Chinese people,  the Chinese Government cracks down  harder,  vowing  that  the  fate  of  Ceausescu will not be  the  fate of  China's military dictator and so-called  president, Yang Shangkun. Party or ganizations have been revived in facto ries. Surveillance of students has intensified. Political indoctrination, for gotten for years, is back. The discon tent of the people is palpable.  This ferment has affected even the  leadership, which was never united  about the proper response to the dem onstrations, and which remains divid ed now.  But the internal instability and do mestic woes of the Beijing government  do not necessarily mean that its dicta torial rule will evaporate  in days or  months or years.  This awareness seem to be what mo tivates  the President  to  ignore  the  events of the last year. ""After all, the  present leader may be in power for a  long time. They are strategically im portant. We cannot afford to upset or  isolate them.""  This calculation is shortsighted. No  government can  last forever against  the will of its people. Neither Noriega,  nor Marcos,  nor  the Shah  could  remain in power, no matter how much  money they poured into their security  apparatus. And if, in the short term,  we won friends  in our fight against  communism, we did so at a far deeper  cost  to  our  good will  among  the  people-who always eventually got the  reins of government back. The fall of  Ceausescu should send a strong mes sage to the White House; it surely did  to the forbidden city.  For  some-including  perhaps  the  President, his National Security Advis er  and  the Deputy  Secretary  of  State-this  eventuality  presents  a  problem. They do not know how to re solve  the  long-term  issue, but know  they need  the short-term gain. So,  they  embrace  the Marcoses,  the  Shahs,  the Li Pengs, and  the Den  Xiaopings. And they scorn the naivete  of the congressional leaders who ques tion their realistic approach.  But, as  the Chinese sage Lao Tse  said, we need not leave our home to  see the world. Our foreign policy can  and should be guided by the principles  we believe in most deeply-that a gov ernment should represent, not repress,  its people. And our policy  toward a  country must reflect what is best for  its people: representative political in stitutions, an environment  that can  nourish individual economic artist and  basic social justice.  The repression of the prodemocracy  demonstrators  in Tiananmen Square  was brutal and unforgiveable. If the  President is right in saying that China  is too important to isolate, he is wrong  to legitimize the government by trying  to  please  it. On  the  contrary,  he  should recognize that the present Chi nese Government  is  acting out of  weakness, not strength. That under standing should guide our response.  Clearly, our first and most appropri ate  response has been  to freeze all  military sales and cooperation, to sus pend significant export licenses, and  ",1990
66,Senate,101,-0.266,583,1,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, yes terday, we began consideration of leg islation to reauthorize the Clean Air  Act. There are few issues Congress has  considered this decade more important  to all Americans  than legislation  to  improve our air quality.  Today, we are more aware and better  informed of  the  important environ mental  challenges  that  face  our  Nation and planet. We are more famil iar with terms such as global warming,  ozone depletion, acid rain, and carbon  monoxide. With this familiarity comes  responsibility. Responsibility  to  take  the necessary action to reduce threats  to our air resources and to begin to  clean up  the mess we  have made.  Today, we take that action.  I congratulate the majority leader,  the chairman of the Environment and  Public Works Committee and the floor  managers of this bill for their efforts  to bring clean air  legislation  to  the  Senate's attention. This action is long  overdue.  NEW MEXICO  Clean air is a particularly important  issue to the citizens of New Mexico. I  am proud of the efforts we have made  in my State. We are blessed with clear  skies and scenic vistas. We hope  to  keep  it  that way. Our utilities and  copper smelters have made the expen sive capital improvements necessary to  reduce harmful S02  emissions. Our  largest city has embarked on a.n ambi tious course of action to attack both  the CO  and  ozone  problems. New  Mexicans are willing to make the sac rifice necessary to preserve air quality.  IMPROVING THE BILL  Mr. President,  I  support clean air  legislation. S. 1630 gives us a compre hensive approach to address clean air  issues. However,  there are provisions  of this bill that must be improved. Let  me review a few of these areas.  ACID DEPOSITION  I strongly support the provision in  title IV of the bill which requires 107  utility plants to reduce their S02 emis sions by January 1, 1995.  In earlier  versions of S. 1630, only 20 plants-in volving 70 boilers-were covered. If the  20-plant option had been adopted, the  resulting  emissions  requirements .  would have meant that the 20 plants  could only use  scrubbers. No other  technology would have been able  to  meet the emissions targets. With 107  plants and a more equitable emissions  ",1990
67,Senate,101,0.687,596,1,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President,  con stituents are writing us in anger that  their Social Security taxes are being  used for other purposes than for sav ings  toward  their  own  retirement.  They don't really mind pay as we go fi nancing for Social Security, because  all of us agree we want to take care of  promises made to current beneficiaries  and those soon to retire.  But it makes people mad that Social  Security taxes are used to conceal the  true size of the deficit in other Federal  funds accounts. They want real sav ings.  President Roosevelt and  the 74th  Congress established Social Security  with  the ""public  relations promise""  that every American would be paying  taxes to save for his or her retirement,  and that is what every American today  wants: Save the money, don't spend it.  I am introducing legislation today to  fulfill  the promise of the 74th Con gress. The Social Security Benefits En hancement Act would create a new  family savings plan benefit as part of  the Social Security system.  The Social Security Benefits En hancement Act is a marriage of the  best  ideas  from  those who  say we  should cut the Social Security tax and  restore  payas-we-go  financing wedded to the proposal by President  Bush to increase our national private  savings rate and create family savings  plan accounts for every American.  I support both of these great, cre ative ideas. Let's have honest account ing  in Government by cutting  the  Social Security tax and let's increase  the national private savings rate,  to  enhance retirement benefits.  The Social Security Benefits En hancement Act would repeal the un necessary 1988 and 1990 tax increases.  Revenues  from  those  tax hikes are  only serving to conceal the deficit in  the Federal funds accounts by collect ing too much currently in the Social  Security trust funds.  The Social Security Benefits En hancement Act would use those sur plus funds to increase the private sav ings rate of every American family,  rather than spending it for other Gov ernment programs. This is what our  constituents want.  Social Security current and future  benefits would not be affected-the fi nancing problem facing Social Securi ty 25 years from now will still confront  a future Congress, as it does today.  Even  today we know some  future  Congress will have to find a way to  redeem the Treasury securities in the  OASDI  trust  funds. Even now, we  know that future retirement benefits  depend on taxes collected in the very  same year benefits are paid out. There  is no saving in the public sector; it's a  contradiction in terms.  Under the Social Security Benefits  Enhancement Act,  there will be real  savings. The future financing problem  for  common  benefits will  be  un changed-but every American family  will also have a Social Security family  savings plan in addition to currently  authorized Social Security benefits.  These SSFSP accounts will make  every American family better prepared  for retirement, for home ownership,  and for financing higher education for  their children. Overall benefits are en hanced.  The Social Security Benefits En hancement Act provides for every em ployer to establish, as part of his pen sion plan, a special account to collect  the surplus that is today going to the  Government for general spending.  Self-employed individuals would be  authorized to set up their own savings  plan, under proper supervision, and  workers whose employers do not par ticipate would have special accounts in  the U.S. Treasury.  Every  year,  the  Social  Security  trustees would calculate how much of  the Social Security tax is needed to  pay  the coming year's benefits, and  the surplus-if any-would be author ized to be paid by the employer,  in stead of  to  the Treasury,  into  the  Social Security family savings plan ac counts that every private pension fund  in America would have, and which this  proposal would establish.  Federal Government employees al ready enjoy a thrift savings plan with  most of the features I would put in  the Social Security Benefits Enhance ment Act. I think the average Ameri can worker  should have  the  same  family savings opportunities as part of  his or her retirement pension system  as the Federal Government employees  enjoy.  I ask unanimous consent for the text  of my bill to be printed in the RECORD  following my remarks.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 2026  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION  1.

68,Senate,101,0.391,609,1,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President,  today I rise along with Senator BIDEN  to introduce the Civil Justice Reform  Act of 1990. This  legislation  is de signed to reduce litigation costs and to  increase the administrative efficiency  of the civil  litigation process  in the  Federal courts.  Over recent years, the workload of  the Federal  court  system  has  in creased  dramatically. At  the  same  time, we must assure that the man power  and  equipment necessary  to  meet this increased workload is provid ed. Unless we do so, the result will be a  feeling among members of the bench  and bar that civil litigation in the Fed eral court system is much too costly  39-059 0-91-20 (Pt. 1)  and takes far too much time to resolve  disputes.  Based  upon  these  concerns,  the  Brookings Institute organized a  task  force which produced the ""Justice For  All Report,"" which makes several rec ommendations to reform the civil jus tice process. The task force was com posed of a vast array of  individuals  that  represent  competing  interests  within our civil  judicial system. The  legislation we are  introducing  today  embodies their recommendations and  should provide a  necessary  starting  point for consideration and discussion.  Among other things, the bill directs  each of the Federal district courts to  develop and  implement civil  justice  delay  and  expense  reduction plans  within guidelines set forth by Con gress. The district courts have been  given flexibility to create procedures  and policies commensurate with  the  characteristics of their own particular  dockets.  Specifically, the bill creates a case  management and  tracking system in  which  cases  are  assigned  to varied  processing paths, each of which have  separate time frames for the comple tion of discovery and for trial. A pre mium is placed on setting early and  firm trial dates. Time guidelines are  set for completion of discovery and  necessary motions. An  emphasis  is  placed on early, active, and continuous  docket control by the court. Addition ally, this bill creates a voluntary alter native dispute resolution program. Fi nally, this legislation provides for im proved and expanded case manage ment training for district court judges.  Mr. President, it  is appropriate to  consider  procedural  changes which  would reduce the costs and delays con fronted by those who seek to resolve  their disputes through the civil litiga tion system.  We must ensure that the public has  confidence in our Federal court system  to  resolve  their  legal disputes. For  these reasons, I am pleased to intro duce the Civil Justice Reform Act of  1990.  By Mr. SYMMS (for himself, Mr.  BINGAMAN, Mr. JOHNSTON, Mr.  McCLURE, Mr. BUMPERS, Mr.  WALLOP,  Mr.  BAUCUS,  Mr.  BURNS, Mr. DIXON, Mr. DOMEN ICI, Mr. GARN, Mr. GORTON, Mr.  GRASSLEY,  Mr.  HATCH,  Mr.  HELMS, Mr. KASTEN, Mr. LoTT,  Mr. LUGAR, Mr. STEVENS, Mr.  WILSON, Mr. SIMON,  and Mr.  HATFIELD):  S.J.

69,,101,0.113,648,1,Mr. MACHTLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  yesterday,  we voted on  the question of overriding  the  President's veto of H.R. 2712,  legislation  to  provide statutory authority to protect Chinese  nationals studying here in  the United States.  There are many reasons I felt it was important  to support the override.  Some will argue that the President's direc tive offers equally as much protection as that  offered under H.R. 2712, legislation Congress woman PELOSI has sponsored-and of which  I am a cosponsor. This may be true from the  administration's mine, or my neighbor's point  of view. But,  then again, we are  not  the  people who would be most affected by  this  decision.  I am not threatened with return to a country  whose leadership conducted a bloody massa cre against my  friends and countrymen; nor  am I troubled with the threat of an unfair trial,  and the potential of my summary execution at  the hands of the government; nor am I threat ened with  reprisals against  family members  abroad who have been forced to write letters  condemning me as an incendiary or a revolu tionary.  The answer to the question of who is most  affected by a decision on whether or not to  override the President's veto is obvious-it is  the Chinese students  themselves. And  it  is  them who  I  think we  should most closely  listen  to as we make decisions  for  their  fu tures, and formulate policy responses to their  concerns.  That message made clear,  I ask you  to  listen  to  the  following excerpt  from a  letter  drafted by a group of Chinese nationals study ing in the United States. They write:  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  We are extremely afraid of our security if  we were forced to return to China. Because  most of us have either participated or been  actively involved in a wide range of peaceful  activities  to  support  the  pro-democracy  movement  in China. The Chinese  fascist  regime has vowed  to persecute those who  dare  to call  for democracy,  freedom and  human rights. We have certainly met the  standard of ""well  founded  fear of perse cution"" if we were forced to return to China  Therefore, we beg you to pass legislation  to eliminate our fears ... We believe that if  the visa status of the 40,000 well-educated  Chinese students and scholars can not be re solved  legislatively,  then  the majority of  them will either apply for political asylum  with  the  INS whose administrative  func tions will be heavily burdened by the  in creased case load, or others who fear for re prisals against their families in China due to  their filing of asylum applications  in  the  U.S. will simply stay here and become ""ille gals"" who cannot perform  their qualified  functions and would be a waste to society as  a whole.  And  I am pleased that the vast majority of  the House of Representatives  joined me  in  making this message heard by voting to over ride the veto of H.R. 2712, and to provide the  Chinese students with  the  legislative remedy  they have called for.  NEWSLETTER AND SURVEY ON  THE FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICIT  HON. ANTHONY C. BEILENSON  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 25, 1990  ",1990
70,,101,-0.44,648,1,Mr. BEILENSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to share with our colleagues a newsletter on  the Federal budget deficit that I wrote for my  constituents  last  fall, and  the  results of  the  questionnaire I sent to them as a followup.  I was personally encouraged  by  the  re sponse to both the newsletter and the ques tionnaire. After  the newsletter was sent, we  received a great many  letters, phone calls,  and comments at community meetings  from  constituents expressing  their grave concerns  about the deficit as well as their willingness to  accept unpopular spending cuts and  tax  in creases to bring this problem under control.  The response to the questionnaire, sent to  over 200,000 households of voters, was even  more gratifying. We  received over 8,000  re sponses-most of which were filled out by two  persons-to  this  rather  time-consuming  survey.  In both part I, ""General Spending Pri orities,"" and part II, ""Specific Choices for Re ducing  the Deficit,""  the respondents showed  strong support  for cutting defense spending  and  raising  taxes-the  two principal ways  available to reduce the deficit.  Seventy-seven percent of  the respondents  believe  that the Federal Government should  spend less on defense, and a majority believe  we should spend more on assistance to  the  poor, on public investment and infrastructure,  and on environmental protection. Near majori ties also want more spending on benefits for  the elderly and on  law enforcement. But,  im portantly, by nearly 2 to 1,  these voters are  January 25, 1990  willing to pay more taxes to fund increases in  these programs.  Asked to choose among specific options for  reducing  the deficit over the next 5 years, a  majority of the respondents selected enough  program cuts-mostly  from defense-to cut  the 1994 deficit by $52 billion, and enough tax  increases to cut that year's deficit by another  $47 billion, assuming  those measures were  enacted now. This response demonstrates the  willingness of the voters of the 23d Congres sional District of California  to accept much  greater spending cuts and tax increases than  President Bush or Congress have  thus  far  been willing to support.  The newsletter and questionnaire follow:  SPECIAL REPORT: THE FEDERAL BUDGET  DEFICIT-SEPTEMBER 1989  (BY CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY C. BEILENSON)  OUR NATION'S MASSIVE BORROWING  IS DRAIN ING OUR RESOURCES AND MORTGAGING OUR  CHILDREN'S FUTURE  The federal government's rapidly growing  mountain of debt, caused by our enormous  annual budget deficits, continues to be the  most  serious  and  threatening  problem  facing our nation.  This report is the first of two newsletters  I am devoting entirely to the subject of the  budget. It discusses why the U.S. govern ment's debt grew so dramatically, how our  annual deficits are hurting the U.S. econo my and our international position, and what  the obstacles are to dealing seriously and re alistically with our budget problem. My  next newsletter will  be  a  questionnaire  giving you the opportunity to choose what  steps  you  personally would  support  to  reduce to deficit.  Why so much attention to this one issue?  Because the threat that these deficits pose  to our nation's economic health profoundly  influences every decision the President and  Congress make  about  every other  issue.  Until we bring these deficits under control,  our options for dealing with every other na tional  problem  are  severely  limited-we  can't even begin to adequately address the  drug crisis, homelessness, gaps in our health  care system or any of the other major social  problems that virtually everyone agrees we  should be confronting. Defense policies, too,  will continue to be shaped more by budget  pressures than by an objective evaluation of  our national security needs.  PILING UP THE NATIONAL DEBT  Budget deficits are not something new;  the  federal  government has  spent more  money than it has taken in almost every  year since World War II. But the deficits  after 1981  have  averaged $180  billion  a  year-nearly  three  times  the size of  the  largest single deficit prior  to 1981. And,  these deficits have occurred at a time when  the  government  has  had  no  legitimate  reason to borrow so heavily: our nation has  been at peace and, for the last seven years,  enjoying what has become the longest eco nomic expansion of the post-World War II  period.  As a result of these huge recent deficits,  our national debt has soared from $930 bil lion in 1981  to $2.8  trillion today. In the  eight years of Ronald Reagan's presidency,  we  tripled the total amount of debt that  had been accumulated during the previous  two hundred years of U.S. history, from the  beginning of George Washington's presiden cy to the end of Jimmy Carter's.

72,House,101,-0.402,713,1,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker, yes terday President Bush wrote that his  budget's chief emphasis was on  the  future.  In  the  last century Charles  Dickens also wrote about the future.  In the Christmas Carol, Scrooge asked  if Tiny Tim would live. He was told if  the shadows of the future remained  unaltered, Tiny Tim would die.  In the Bush future, budget author ity for housing the elderly and handi capped children like Tiny Tim would  decline by $201 million from the fiscal  year 1991 baseline, but there is more  relative growth in the defense spend ing than in fiscal year 1986.  In the Bush future, budget author ity for child nutrition programs for  children like Tiny Tim would decline  by $460 million from the fiscal year  1991 baseline, but there is more rela tive growth in defense spending than  in fiscal year 1987.  In the Bush future, budget author ity for Medicaid for children like Tiny  Tim would decline by $88 million for  fiscal year 1991 baseline, but there is  more relative growth iri defense spend ing than in fiscal year 1990.  This budget is not dead on arrival.  President Bush may be able  to  live  with it, but it's going to kill Tiny Tim.  URGING  CONSIDERATION  OF  .

74,House,101,-0.133,739,1,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  I  thank  the chairman of  the whole  Committee on Agriculture for calling  this special order. I want to pay him  special tribute for his advocacy of agri culture and rural issues in this coun try. No Member of Congress has done  more  to alert  the American people,  both  urban  and  rural Americans,  about the needs and hopes and aspira tions of folks  in rural America than  the gentleman from Texas CMr. DE LA  GARZA].  His  charts  showing  the  amount of money spent on agriculture  as compared with the entire budget, in  showing what a small percentage of  our dollars are actually spent on agri cultural programs, are renowned in a  variety of circles in this country as he  has shown how little we invest in agri culture compared with the dividend we  receive from the producers of food and  fiber.  The  items  that my  subcommittee  has jurisdiction on, wheat, corn, other  feed grains, and soybeans, are among  the biggest crops  in this country in  terms of value.  When we entered the beginning of  this 5-year farm bill we had tremen dous problems in agriculture. Some of  those still exist, particularly  in  the  high plains in western Kansas, Okla homa, and Texas. Problems in agricul ture, of course, remain in many parts  of this country.  We lost tens of thousands of farmers  to low prices. There was an epidemic  of low prices, agricultural foreclosures  and farm dislocations during the first  4 or 5 years of this decade.  The 1985 farm bill was not perfect  and some of us had problems with it.  In fact, I even voted against the bill  because I was worried what it might  do to the budgetary problems of this  country.  Still that 1985 farm bill did provide a  safety net for wheat farmers and for  corn farmers. Had it not been for that  bill, lots of additional folks would have  gone under. The purpose of the bill  was a safety net. It provided that func tion.  It is my hope that if we go forward  into the 1990 farm bill, we will recog nize  that we need  to continue that  safety net. We need to resist efforts to  dramatically reduce the impact of that  safety net, so that farmers, particular ly younger farmers getting into agri culture for the first time, can stay in  business and can be productive con tributors  to  this nation's economic  strength.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  think  that will  happen because I sense that there is a  bipartisan  feeling, Republicans  and  Democrats in this body, who want to  see American agriculture sustain itself,  who are not willing  to unilaterally  disarm  to our competitors overseas  until such time as we see that they in  fact want to lay down some of their  more difficult positions in trade.  So it is my hope that we will produce  a 1985 farm bill that does not reduce  target prices and that in fact contin ues this safety net that we have pro duced for so long.  In addition it is my hope that we will  continue the export enhancement pro gram which has done  so much  to  enable our producers to be competitive  in the world, particularly in the areas  of the grains and soybeans.  This export enhancement program  has allowed us  to compete with the  Europeans in providing sales of these  products to the Soviet Union, to third  world nations, and in fact to countries  all over the world. Without that pro gram there is no doubt that we would  have not made a lot of sales that we in  fact did make.  I would point out, however, that we  have found that there have been some  problems in the administration of that  program, particularly during the last  couple years of the previous adminis tration. It is my hope that Secretary  Yeutter and those other folks who are  running the department now have rec onciled  themselves  to some changes  which are necessary to restore confi dence that that program is working,  that there are no preferential deals to  perhaps some of the large internation al grain companies, and that honesty  prevails in the operation of the export  enhancement program.  I  think that is happening.  I have  confidence now that under Secretary  Yeutter and some of the folks within  the administration are doing their best  to make sure that that program is an  effective program.  The final thing I would talk about is  not specifically inside the jurisdiction  of my subcommittee. It relates, howev er, to the Food Stamp Program.  The Food Stamp Program has prob ably done more than any other Feder al program to ensure that we do not  ",1990

It is a very dif ferent world from the one that con fronted us in 1950, far different even,  from that which existed in 1989. It is a  more hopeful world. The toppling of  Communist dictatorships  throughout  Eastern Europe holds the prospect of  a safer, more prosperous future.  The United States has an urgent  need-a compelling national interest to promote  the process of peaceful  change underway  today  in Eastern  Europe.  U.S. spending priorities must reflect  this need. I am disappointed that the  President's budget message and his  State of the Union Address, fail to re flect this urgency.  For decades now we have poured lit erally  trillions of dollars  into stem ming  the  tide of  communism with  tanks and bombs and fighter planes.  While we must maintain a stable con ventional ~nd nuclear deterrent, new  global reallties oblige us to shift our  priorities. We need, too, to use our dol lars to nurture the seeds of democra cy, help to provide the support that it  so desperately needs  to survive. For  just a fraction of the cost of confront ing communism militarily, we could  complement our military efforts with  other more productive initiatives.  We need a comprehensive plan  to  promote  and  secure  democracy  in  Eastern Europe. I believe the timidity  of the Bush administration's approach  is unacceptable.  I am therefore today calling for new  initiatives patterned after  the Mar shall plan  to  aid Eastern Europe.  These countries were originally includ ed in that 1947 plan that fueled the re covery of Western Europe, making the  Common Market nations a bastion of  democracy and economic success. Because of the intervention of the Soviet  Union, Eastern European  countries  were excluded from the Marshall plan  at that time. It is now long past time  for them to join their Western neighbors in a comprehensive effort to build  a more peaceful, more democratic, less  confrontational Europe.  Congress has already taken a solid  first step in setting forth the blueprint  for such a program. Last November,  1~ we passed the landmark Support for  Eastern European Democracy Act of  1989 CSEEDl. This legislation provided  some  assistance-currency  stabilization, food aid,  investment funds-for  Poland  and Hungary  as  they  em barked on the initial stages of reform.  Now we need to look beyond. We must  prepare  ourselves  for  changes  throughout Eastern Europe, and  in  other areas of the world, as communist regimes continue to fail.  8  30  55  40  ~~  50  p~litical  _I am therefore pleased to join today  with Senator PELL  to  introduce  a  SEED II bill designed to expand last  year's measure to cover all of Eastern  Europe.

When Senator SIMON, Senator PELL,  and I worked together in drafting the  SEED legislation last fall, only Poland  and Hungary had yet thrown off the  yoke of communism. Now, Rumania,  Czechoslavakia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia,  and East Germany have all made sig nificant strides in ending Communist  domination and in taking steps toward  greater democracy in their countries.  We must have the foresight and deter mination to match the people of East ern Europe and  join with  them  in  turning a hopeful vision into a pros perous, democratic reality.  The  pace  of  reform  in Eastern  Europe over the past few months has  been overwhelming. While these coun tries struggle to reshape their econom ic  and  institutions,  their  Western neighbors struggle with them  to formulate a vision of the future and  to  determine what  their own  role  should be. One thing is clear: Commu nism is a bankrupt philosophy. There  can be no turning back to the repres sive policies of  totalitarian commu nism  in Eastern Europe. Yet  there  remain a host of questions to be an swered,  difficulties  to be overcome  and decisions to be made.  '  The  issues  facing Eastern Europe  are extraordinarily divisive. The ques tion is no longer how to reform, it is  how much  to  reform, how  soon  to  reform, and in what manner and order  to proceed. These questions will not be  answ~red quickly or painlessly, for re shapmg a  society and an economic  system requires consensus as well as  determination and skills-and consen sus is still extremely elusive.  The erosion of Communist control  has revealed another set of unresolved  conflicts. Ethnic tensions in Bulgaria,  Hungary,  and  Romania-indeed  throughout the Eastern bloc-threat en to weaken the nascent democracy  movements.  Nationalist  sentiments  revive old territorial claims and fears  of renewed militarism. The change in  governments  is  necessarily  accom plished by the uncertainties surround ing the fate of the Warsaw Pact and  the  security  of  the Soviet Union.  These  issues not only make change  more difficult, but they can potential ly destabilize all of Europe.  Such  questions  obviously  concern  NATO and the West as much as they  concern Moscow and the Eastern bloc.  What role should the Western coun tries be playing-both vis-a-vis Eastern  Europe and the Soviet Union? At what  point  should  our  support  extend  beyond warm  rhetoric? Should our  ",1990
88,Senate,101,-0.397,843,1,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President,  in all  the tributes to Martin Luther King,  Jr., there is one unusual one written  by Larry A.  Still  for  the Chicago  Metro News,  talking  about Martin  Luther King, Jr., as a college student.  I had the privilege of working a little  with Dr. King. As a young State legis lator, Dr. King asked me to come and  speak at the second anniversary of the  bus boycott in Montgomery, AL, at the  Bodextra Avenue Baptist Church.  I  had  the opportunity of spending 2  days with him at that point, and to  join in the early efforts for civil rights  in this Nation.  But, too often, perhaps, we focus on  Martin Luther King, Jr., as an already  emerged national leader. He did not  emerge overnight, and the column by  Larry Still should be encouragement  to students around the Nation.  I ask to insert this article into the  RECORD at this point.  The material is as follows:  [From the Chicago Metro News, Jan. 20,  1990]  MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., THE COLLEGE  STUDENT  <By Larry A. Still)  1989-90 could possibly be the second gene sis of when the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr. connects with college students.  For me however,  the greatness of Dr.  King grows stronger each year. Maybe this  is because I have continued to be drawn to  his life as doer, as well as dreamer.  Some veteran civil  rights activists have  said that King was not a saint, but a human  being. Yes, he was human, but what a  human being he was for all times.  Not every student will receive a Ph.D. in  Systematic Theology from Boston Universi ty as he did. Or graduate from Morehouse  College at  the age of 19. But  there are  enough parallels in Dr. King's collegiate ex perience and that of many college students  today.  In an earlier column, I spoke of the impor tance of new student orientations.  I mention this for two reasons; 1) at his  orientation/convocation, Martin King met  Dr. Benjamin Mays, one of  this nation's  greatest educators and 2>  like most fresh men, young Martin wasn't sure what he  would do career wise.  He participated in extracurricular activi ties; the glee club, the Young Men's Chris tian Association, the NAACP, the student faculty discipline committee.  Today, many multi-cultural students like  Martin, do become  standouts with  their  schools' newspapers, radio stations, student  governments and other social and academic  organizations.  Martin was a commuter student. He lived  at home. Today, the number of commuter  students, part time students and other non traditional  students  in higher  education  have completely changed the face of Ameri can colleges and universities.  After Morehouse, he won a scholarship to  Crozer Theological Seminary  in Chester,  Pennsylvania. While there, he enjoyed the  social life in nearby Philadelphia, attending  parties  and making  friends. Always  the  scholar he read Henry David Thoreau, Karl  Marx, Mahatma Gandhi, to name a few.  He next attended Boston University. Like  many students, he met a special friend, a  talented  and  pretty  young woman  in  Boston, who later became his wife and con fidant.  On August 28, 1955, Emmett Till, a 14  year old Chicago boy visiting relatives  in  Mississippi, was  kidnapped  and  lynched.  Two months earlier, Martin Luther King,  Jr. was awarded his Ph.D. from Boston Uni versity.  Today, racism continues to impact on col lege students. It is partly up to students and  officials to turn these negatives into motiva tors and positive reinforcers.  The  bonding  between Dr. King  and  today's students is coming about via the de mystification of this great world  teacher preacher <cut in the mold of Dr. Mays>.  Dr. King, the dreamer, may be a pretty  tough act for young people to follow, but  Dr. King,  the college student doer, may  touch more student scholars during  this  crucial developmental stage.e  INDEPENDENCE  ANNIVERSARY  OF THE FREE UKRAINIAN RE PUBLIC   ",1990
89,,101,0.47,856,1,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  take this time to congratulate a constituent of  mine, Army Pvt. Abel Velasco. Private Ve lasco participated  in  the successful  ""Oper ation Just Cause"" in Panama.  Abel, stationed at Fort Ord, had planned to  spend Christmas with his  family  in Brawley.  On  December  20  he  was  deployed  to  Panama. Private Velasco's mission while  in  Panama was to confiscate weapons and cap ture anyone linked to General Noriega.  For his service in Panama, Abel was award ed the Army Commendation Medal, which rec ognizes ""superior judgment and tactical exper tise far superior to his contemporaries.""  I am  including  for  the RECORD an article  that appeared in the Imperial Valley Press re garding Private Abel's experience.  I know my  colleagues join me in saying ""Thank you for a  job well done.""  [From the Imperial Valley Press, Jan. 24,  1990]  LATE CHRISTMAS FOR VELASCO  (By Lori Johnson>  Christmas came a month late but with  extra joy when Army Private Abel Velasco  came home to Brawley Saturday after par ticipating in the United States invasion of  Panama.  On Dec. 20 the Velasco family's tradition al Christmas plans were dashed when 19year-old Abel Velasco was shipped out as  part of the force sent to Panama to capture  Manuel Noriega and  free Panama of his  control.  He was deployed the day before he was to  come home  for Christmas on such short  notice he did not have  time  to  tell his  family.  ""I had no warning at all,"" said Velasco. ""It  was like 'pack your bags and go.' ""  ""It was  scary.  I  didn't know what  expect,"" he said.  Instead of tamales and a joyous family re union, Velasco found himself on Christmas  day in the midst of combat in Panama City,  working as an Army translator.  to  January 30, 1990  Velasco said there were so few bilingual  soldiers that he was taken from his platoon  to work directly with his captain.  ""My job was to find out information on  key personnel in the Noriega forces,"" said  Velasco.  Armed with a M16 rifle, Velasco said he  accompanied officers as they stormed build ings and homes of apparent Noriega associ ates. He said their mission was to confiscate  weapons and,  if possible, capture anyone  linked to Noriega.  He said he also helped to restore order in  the streets that was plagued with looting.  ""It's hard to explain,"" said Velasco. ""You  have to be there to know what happen. Pic ture L.A. with no law and  throw a  little  jungle in there. Everyone was doing what  they wanted to do.''  But Velasco was  reminded often of the  danger. ""There was sniper fire,"" he recalled.  When asked if anyone close to him was  wounded or killed in combat he declined to  comment. He said he was told by his superi ors not to talk about it.  Of  the  experience, Velasco  said,  ""You  don't really appreciate what life  is about  until you are put into this type of situation.  You learn to value life. You learn to appre ciate everything; a shower, a bed.""  Velasco had also been sent to Panama last  spring to restore order after riots started  when Noriega overturned the elections.  Valasco was awarded ""The Army Com mendation Medal"" for his participation in  ""Operation Just Cause."" He was chosen  from his company of 125  to  receive  the  medal. The certificate accompanying  the  medal stated, ""During this combat action,  <Velasco)  demonstrated  super  judgement,  initiative and tactical expertise far superior  to his contemporaries.""  Velasco, a native of Brawley, entered the  Army after he graduated  from Brawley  Union High School in 1988. He now is sta tioned in Fort Ord in Monterey.  The mission in Panama wasn't easy for his  mother and father Richard and Rachel Ve lasco of Brawley.  His mother recalled what she told her son  on the phone, ""As long as I hear your voice,  everything is OK.'  Although his mother spoke to him about  four times when he was in Panama, she still  worried.  ""Sometimes I would look at the news and  start crying,"" she said.  She said Christmas was especially hard.  ""We always make  a wish on Christmas  night,"" said Mrs. Velasco. ""We always have  a toast. But someone was missing.''  Mrs. Velasco recalled a telephone conver sation with her son. He asked her if they  were going to have a Christmas dinner when  he returned. She answered, ""Yes mijo. We  are.""

90,,101,0.16,869,1,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am honored to join my colleagues, Congress men Gus YATRON and DOUG BEREUTER, as  an original sponsor of a resolution calling for  the timely consideration of the Convention on  the Rights of the Child. The convention was  adopted by the 44th General Assembly of the  United Nations on November 20, 1989, and  must now be ratified by the Member States at least 20  in order to make  it binding. The  U.S. Government  is currently  involved  in an  interagency review of the convention.  The  convention,  hammered  out  after a  decade of debate by the international commu nity, enumerates many of the legal and moral  protections which should be guaranteed by  the State. A number of the protections do not  go far enough and the document certainly is  not absolutely perfect but,  for  the first time,  nations would commit themselves to protect ing a broad range of rights for children.  As Congressional Representative  of  the  United States Delegation  to  the United Na tions, Mr. Speaker,  I had  the opportunity to  present the U.S. statement on adoption of the  convention on November 10, 1989,  in New  York.  For consideration by my colleagues,  I  in clude my speech at this point in the RECORD.  DEFINING THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN  After 10 years of constructive dialogue,  seemingly endless consultations, and finally  an agreement, the Commission on Human  Rights has presented the Convention on the  Rights of the Child to the UN General As sembly for adoption. The United States par ticipated actively in the drafting of the con vention. We believe that it represents a no table step forward in the needed promotion  and protection of the rights of children. Al though the convention is far from perfect no agreement ever  is-the United States  strongly believes in the enumerated commit ments and goals of the convention, and it is  our hope that the General Assembly will  adopt the text without change.  The Government of Poland deserves much  of the credit for the conclusion of this con vention. The version we have before us  today represents many years of debate and  revisions  to  the Government of Poland's  first draft; but if it were not for the initial  ",1990

92,House,101,0.246,882,1,Mr. QUILLEN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  the main purpose of  the voter registration bill is supposed  . to be to make it easier for people to  vote.  In that spirit, yesterday in the Rules  Committee, I offered an open rule in  order to make it easier for Members to  vote on amendments to the voter reg istration bill. But instead of welcoming  my proposal to allow Members to vote,  the Rules Committee by a party-line  vote turned down my open rule pro posal and  instead reported  the rule  before us today, which closes off all  amemdnents except for one package to  be considered en bloc. There  is no  shortage of amendments to be consid eredr In the Rules Committee yester day,  the gentlewoman from Nevada,  [Mrs. VUCANOVICH] asked to have an  amendment made  in order to insure  that this legislation would not burden  the States with a  lot of extra costs.  The gentleman  from Colorado  [Mr.  HEFLEY]  presented  three  separate  amendments. One was designed to en hance voter participation. A  second  was designed to ensure that voter reg istration rolls are accurate. A  third  would protect the integrity of the elec toral process.  Mr. Speaker, these are all reasonable  proposals which deserve to be consid ered separately on their merits, not  jammed into an en bloc package where  only one vote will be allowed on a  large group of amendments.

93,House,101,0.227,895,1,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, at  the outset I would like to thank the  gentleman from New York for having  this subject discussed today. I think it  is a very timely issue.  Mr. Speaker,  the winds of change  are blowing around the world. From  the Soviet Union to Eastern Europe,  democracy is on the move along with a  growing respect for justice and human  rights. The Berlin Wall, once thought  to be a permanent fixture dividing the  free world and the Soviet empire, has  crumbled  into  souvenirs.  Impressive  progress is also being made in resolv ing  the problems of South Africa,  Angola, Cambodia, and Central Amer ica. One problem, however, seems to  resist resolution. One dilemma resists  the application of fairness, justice, and  sensitivity to human rights. Cyprus is  that problem.  Since 1974,  the tragedy of Cyprus  has been with us. The cruel Turkish  invasion of  that  island  caused  the  death of thousands. Over 1,600 Greek  Cypriots are still missing along with a  number of American citizens. One of  them  is Andrew Kassapis,  a  young  Michigan residenf who was taken from  his family's home on Cyprus and never  seen again.  That military action resulted in the  displacement of 200,000 Greek Cypri ots who became refugees in their own  land. When they were forced out of  the northern part of the island, they  left behind land, homes, and personal  property worth millions  of  dollars.  Some of that property has been carted  off to Turkey. None of those families  have been compensated for their huge  losses.  In addition to illegally occupying the  northern tier of Cyprus with 30,000  troops, who  are  still  armed with  United  States  supplied  equipment,  Turkey dispatched 60,000 Anatolian  settlers to the island. Even the Turk ish Cypriots  resent  the presence of  those ""non Cypriots"" on  that once united island. What is being done to  solve the Cyprus problem?  The United Nations-sponsored inter communal talks broke down  in July  when Mr. Denktash objected to how  the United Nations presented a draft  outline to him. The outline provided  food for thought about how the talks  should proceed and how the two par ties to the dispute could work together  to settle the dispute. In recent weeks,  Secretary General Perez de Cuellar in vited both Mr. Denktash and Presi dent Vassiliou  of  the Republic  of  Cyprus  to  the United Nations  for  talks. Again, Mr. Denktash was offend ed by the way in which the Secretary  General  issued  the  invitation. Presi dent Vassiliou, who has shown amaz ing  flexibility and determination  to  pursue peace talks, willingly accepted  the  invitation. Mr. Denktash should  worry more about solving the Cyprus  problem  and  less  about  diplomatic  niceties. This is the time for forward  movement  in  the peace  process  if  there is ever going to be peace on that  divided island.  The key  to peace on Cyprus  is  in  Ankara. It is time for Turkish authori ties to talk with Mr. Denktash about  the reality of Cyprus and the need to  settle that longstanding problem.  As  the gentleman pointed out, we  ought to be looking at the amount of  money we are giving Turkey. In fact, I  would like to see it sharply reduced to  be used as leverage, as the gentleman  talked about, to force the two parties  to get together to resolve these issues.  As changes occur at breakneck speed  around the world, Turkish and Turk ish Cypriot authorities are increasing ly seen by  the world community as  dragging  their  feet on  a  fair  and  timely resolution of the Cyprus con flict. Turkey  is  the only democratic  nation in Europe that has its troops  occupying a  foreign country. Turkey  wants to join the European Communi ty, but surely must realize that Eu rope's  doors will  be  closed  until  Ankara makes progress on the Cyprus  problem.  It is  time  to  resolve  the  Cyprus dilemma and make the green  line part of history along with  the  Berlin Wall. It is time to aim for the  goals set by President Bush a  few  years ago when he said, ""We seek for  Cyprus  a  constitutional  democracy  based on majority rule, the rule of law,  and the protection of minority rights.""  I urge my colleagues to work togeth er with me in Congress to bring about  a peaceful  resolution of  the Cyprus  problem.  Until  there  is  honest  progress made on a resolution of that  problem, Congress should ensure that  ",1990

95,Senate,101,0.52,947,1,Mr. NICKLES.," If the Senator will  yield  for  just a quick question. He  mentioned residual risks, that there is  a drop dead provision, and if they do  not meet that requirement, the 1 in  10,000, if they are not able to reduce  below  that  level,  that plant would  have to shut down by the year 2005, I  think you said, would be the first year.  The year for the tier 2 reductions in  auto emissions is 2003. My statement  and my plea would be: Why do we not  do  the first part of this bill, pass a  clean air bill, and then in 1997 let us  look at tier 2 on auto emissions, let us  look at residual risks, after we have  had a chance to analyze a few years of  experience for the maximum achieva ble controllable  technology and  the  tier 1 tailpipe standards?  In other words,  let us not pass in  this bill what we do not really know  how to define, what is going to happen  on auto emissions by the year 2003  and residual risks by the year 2005.  Let us pass what at least we think we  can do now.  Basically this is the approach taken  in  the administration's proposal on  emissions and on  toxics,  let us pass  those phases now and let us take an other look in 1997 or maybe 1996 and  see what kind of progress we have  made,  see what  is  achievable. Why  pass something now, my question is to  the Senator, that is setting drop dead  dates to firms  if they cannot invent  certain technology by the year 2005?  Why set mandates now on the auto in dustry that are really expensive-esti mates vary-or currently impossible to  meet by the year 2003? Why do we not  look at that again 6 or 7 years from  now?

97,,101,0.739,986,1,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker,  in opposition  to  the recent surge of approval for the Canadian  Health Care Program, I would like to emphaEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  size the resulting  loss of quality care for pa tients in need of immediate attention. The illu sion in Canada, that theirs is essentially a free  system, is driving both doctors and patients to  the borders.  I believe any cost-effective pro gram orchestrated by the Government is real istically going  to be more concerned with  meeting  the guidelines and  restrictions set  forth  on paper  rather  than  caring  for  the  needs of a particular patient.  The following article by Leona Rubin Kras now, ""'Free' Health Care Doesn't Mean Qual ity Health Care,"" illustrates the frustration and  cost  of  coping with  the  faulty Canadian  system. Her  experience with  childbirth  in  Canada began with overcrowded clinics and  not being able  to see a doctor, and ended  after she had endured 57 hours of labor, a  Caesarean section, and five different doctors.  Not only was she  lacking  information about  prenatal care and counseling, but she  later  came to the United States where she was di agnosed with having anemia. The difference  between our  two systems,  it seems,  is not  merely financial. Our health is a dear price to  pay for what some call a cost-effective gov ernment health plan.  FREE HEALTH CARE DOESN'T MEAN QUALITY  HEALTH CARE  <By Leona Rubin Krasnow)  The U.S. media are stressing the advan tages of the Canadian health-care system.  Those who have received medical care in  Canada know that the media are mistaken.  A segment of a  recent MacNeil/Lehrer  NewsHour  dealt with  a  comparison  of  health  care  in  the United States  and  Canada. The program seemed to stress that  U.S. health care is not cost-effective. Mean while, Canadian patients interviewed for the  show were happy to receive ""free"" and, in  their opinion, adequate medical care from  their government.  I lived in Canada for a year-and-a-half and  had my  first child  there. The Canadian  system was inadequate in several areas, in cluding prenatal care and counseling, man agement of labor and delivery, and postna tal followup. I saw a physician only twice in  nine months; first  to confirm that I was  pregnant and later so medication could be  prescribed to combat swelling in my hands  and legs.  The common procedure in Canada was for  a pregnant woman to visit a clinic once a  month. The clinics always were crowded,  and waiting periods of three to four hours  were common. I got the impression that the  doctors and other medical personnel were  not personally involved in my welfare. To  them, I was just a number in the waiting  room.  When I went to the hopsital to have my  baby, I was wheeled into the delivery room  and back into the labor room three times.  During the 57 hours I was in labor, I was at tended by five different physicians; whoever  was on call was my doctor.  My care was not totally free. My husband  received a phone bill for $3.57 because he  called an obstetrician in Sudbury to ask his  advice. The specialist recommended a Cae sarean section. When I awoke from the an esthetic, hospital personnel wouldn't allow  me to see my baby. They said I couldn't be  moved yet and that the infant was in an in cubator. I was sure that he had died until  they brought him to me the next day.  Two weeks later, I went to the clinic. My  baby and I spent five or six minutes with  January 31, 1990  the surgeon, who checked us briefly and  gave me a pamphlet about baby care. That  was our final visit. If I had problems or  questions, I could call a doctor, but only be tween 4:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. Since everyone  tried to call during that time period, it was  practically impossible to get through. In an  emergency, I was to go to the hospital emer gency  room.  However,  as  a  first-time  mother, I sometimes had a simple question  about diaper rash or some other common  problem;  it would have been nice  just to  have someone knowledgeable to talk to.  I was extremely tjred for weeks, but I as sumed that my fatigue was caused by my  difficult labor and Caesarean section. When  ny son was five months old, we took him to  New York  to meet his grandparents. My  mother said I looked terribly pale and took  me  to her doctor. He  found  that I was  anemic, and he was shocked that none of  my Canadian doctors had done a blood test  or prescribed iron pills for me. He also was  surprised that none of those physicians told  me that I might need a Caesarean section  because my pelvis was small.  Indeed, my  mother and older sister had required Cae sarean sections for the same reason.  I realized the difference between the U.S.  and Canadian health-care systems when I  had my second baby in the United States. I  didn't have to wait three hours every month  to see my obstetrician. He was patient, reas suring and understanding; he made me feel  like a special person. I knew he would be  there for me when my time came. I also had  a wonderful pediatrician whom I could call  any time to ask questions about the baby.  Next week, I have to go to the hospital for  a cervical biopsy. My doctor apologized for  delaying this procedure one week because  he was going on vacation. I would have had  to wait much longer if the United States  had a socialized medical-care system similar  to that in Canada. I have every confidence  in my doctor and in the care I will receive. I  never will return to Canada's nightmarish  health-care system, even if it is free.  MILITARY TRASH INTO CASH  HON.

98,,101,0.419,986,1,Mr. PACKARD.," Mr. Speaker, I want to rec ognize the success of a Federal statute, sec tion 2577, title 10, United States Code, which  provides incentives for military bases to estab lish effective waste recycling programs.

Since  this  law's enactment many bases  have improved their recycling efforts reducing  our waste stream, preventing pollution, and  conserving natural resources.

TOM CAMPBELL  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 31, 1990  ",1990
100,,101,0.256,999,1,Mr. CAMPBELL of California.," Mr. Speaker,  last fall  it was necessary for me to return to  California after  the Loma Prieta earthquake.  Consequently,  I was not able to cast a vote  on four issues which came before the House.  It has recently come to my attention that my  preferences on  those bills had not been  re corded. Hence, I would now like to clarify, for  the  record, how  I would have voted had  I  been present.  The first vote was rollcall 292, pertaining to  H.R.  3299,  the budget  reconciliation bill.  I  would have voted  in  favor of  the Frenzel  motion  to  instruct  the House conferees  to  recede from the House position on provisions  that would  lose revenue,  increase spending,  or have no budget effect. The repeals of the  Catastrophic Coverage Act and section 89  employee-benefits were excepted.  I believe  that  the Frenzel motion would have been  good budgeting and a positive step  toward  achieving the budget reconciliation goal.  The second vote, rollcall 293, was passage  of H.R. 2494,  international development and  finance authorization.  I believe  that  the bill  provided  for too great a potential  for simple  dole-kind of aid to foreign nations with no re quirement  for adequate economic  infrastruc ture. My vote would have been no.  The third vote, rollcall 294, pertained to the  cargo preference requirements in H.R. 3402,  aid  to Poland and Hungary.  I would have  voted  for  the  substitution  to  the Grandy  amendment. The substitution would have re sulted in a reduction in the percentage, from  75 to 50, of United States food-aid shipments  to Poland required  to be shipped on United  Stated  flag-merchant  ships.  Cargo  prefer ences have the dual effect of increasing the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  cost of the aid and  lessening the amount of  money which can be used for the actual aid.  The beneficiaries of such a policy are a very  small group of U.S. shipowners and their em ployees. The provision is anticompetitive and  in a very real sense takes food money away  from hungry people who need it.  The last vote, rollcall 295, was passage of  H.R. 3402, aid to Poland and Hungary. I would  have voted yes for the bill. However, I would  have preferred less money for direct govern mental subsidy and more for capitalistic incen tives.  ROSA PARKS-AMERICA'S  FREEDOM CHAMPION  HON.

LOUIS STOKES  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 31, 1990  ",1990
102,,101,-0.578,999,1,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker, last November, I  was appointed to serve on the Harvard AIDS  Institute Advisory Council. The council is com posed of concerned leaders who will be ac tively supporting the work of the institute in its  effort to bring AIDS to the forefront of national  attention and to provide new perspectives on  the AIDS crisis. The goals of the institute in clude  the development of an AIDS vaccine,  the prevention of the further spread of the epi demic, and helping developing countries  re spond to the epidemic.  During the advisory council's initial meeting,  Dr. June E. Osborn, who serves as chairman  of the National Commission on AIDS and also  as dean of the University of Michigan School  of Public Health, delivered a thoughtful and in sightful speech entitled,  ""AIDS  in  the Year  2000."" Dr. Osborn's remarks addressed  the  cultural, social, and political aspects of  the  AIDS epidemic. Her comments on our coun try's health care system and the social conse quences of the growing AIDS epidemic seem  particularly relevant as we begin our legisla tive session.  I am pleased to share Dr. Osborn's remarks  with my colleagues and hope they will take a  moment to consider her analysis:  AIDS IN THE YEAR 2000  <By June E. Osborn, M.D.)  I  am not much of a  futurist, and  the  charge to anticipate vistas of the year 2000  has caused me considerable unease in the  past. It still does-but the peculiar traits of  the human immunodeficiency virus make it  unpleasantly easy to offer some predictions.  As our insight sharpens, the median interval  between onset of  infection and advent of  AIDS keeps growing  longer. For a while  there, during the past couple of years, the  consensus about average time elapsed from  infection with HIV  to diagnosis of AIDS  seemed to have settled at 7 years. The fra gility of that figure was intuitively obvious,  since the epidemic has been recognized for  only 8 years; but I clung tightly to it, taking  heart from modelers who seemed to rein force the epidemiologists, and hoping that  ongoing studies would soon show curves to  be peaking or leveling off <or whatever>.  I am afraid my optimism had the better of  me, for recently it is becoming clear that  the likely interval is 10 or even 11 years.  Since that is the median interval, there will  be many people who will  take  longer  to  become ill; indeed, there is good news from  the AZT front that suggests that we may be  able to extend the duration of asymptomat ic HIV infection even further. And  if all  that is true, we aren't really being futurists  when we discuss people who will be caught  up  in the epidemic by the year 2000.  In  point of fact, we are talking about people  who became infected last week!  Of course, there is not as much informa tion as one would like, ideally, to tell us how  many of them there are. We have only gen eral descriptive clues about who they are.  On the positive side, we have the knowledge  that might allow us to stop further spread  next week, which would surely help mat",1990

106,,101,0.372,1103,1,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, William Korey, di rector of international policy research for B'nai  B'rith, has written an article in the New York  Times warning  of pogroms against Soviet  Jews.  I believe our colleagues will  find his  views both informative and disturbing. At this  point, I wish to enter his article into the CON GRESSIONAL RECORD.  A FEAR OF POGROMS HAUNTS SOVIET JEWS  <By William Korey)  At the historic Congress of Jewish Organi zations held in Moscow  in December, the  most talked-about worry was the real possi bility of pogroms in the near future. This  month's slaughter of Aremenians by Azer baijanis in Baku, which has repeatedly been  described as a pogrom, suggests that during  the nationalist unrest  across  the Soviet  Union Jews could again become mob vic tims. Thus, Jews, recalling the bad old czar ist days, are particularly worried by  the  Kremlin's continued cold silence about their  fears.  When delegates from 126 Jewish cultural  organizations  in 70  cities assembled,  the  most important speech stressed a ""sharp up surge of public anti-Semitism,"" which is the  flip side of glasnost.  Severe economic dislocations and political  instability,  the analysis noted,  aggravate  tensions and permit the Jew to be a scape goat for the problems of perestroika.  WISE WORDS OF ADVICE  ON  THE  REAL MIKHAIL GORBA CHEV  Thursday, February 1, 1990  ",1990
107,,101,0.378,1103,1,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, during a  recent speech at Time Magazine's ""Man of  the Year"" dinner,  former President Richard  Nixon analyzed the real Mikhail Gorbachev his goals, his power, his weaknesses and his  challenges. The historic events of  the past  year are  incredible and Mr. Gorbachev has  played a major role in their continued unfold ing. Unfortunately, some  in  the West have  become  carried  away with  ""Gorby-mania""  and, to borrow President Nixon's analogy, are  thinking  too much with  their hearts and not  their heads. These are time of great hope, but  they are also  times with difficult challenges  demanding strong,  level headed  leadership  and policy.  I strongly suggest that my colleagues care fully study President Nixon's very  insightful  analysis. After examining his comments, I be lieve others will agree with me that President  Nixon's points are very much on the mark and  worth  incorporating  into  our  thinking  and  policy for the new decade.  [From the Washington Times, Jan. 31,  Documentation was not difficult to come  by; more  than 50 desecrations of Jewish  cemeteries, some 1,000 anti-Semitic rallies,  and vitriolic hate leaflets in the thousands  distributed everywhere. Moreover, some 60  goons from Pamyat, a chauvinist Russian  national movement, greeted the delegates  with cries of ""Yid!"" and ""Jewish prostitute!""  Beyond  these  hate-spewing  vulgarities,  and reinforcing  them,  is  the defense and  promotion  of  Pamyat  and  anti-Jewish  stereotypes by prominent and conservative  nationalist publications.  Then, too, there are newly formed patriot ic and religious organizations that would os tracize the Jew as ""alien"" and ""cosmopoli tan"" <a resurrected Stalinist era code word  meaning ""traitor""), and populist novelists  fill their books and essays with flagrant ap peals to bigotry.  Only the Young Communist League news paper has carried as Cassandralike warning.  Written by  the Lithuanian Jewish writer  Grigory Kanovich, a member of the Con gress of People's Deputies, the article de scribed ""clouds of pogroms  . . . gathering  over our heads."" He expressed dismay that  ""as this incitement to murder takes place  before  the eyes of  all,""  the authorities  ""ignore the thugs and inciters.""  From President Mikhail Gorbachev not a  single word has come-no  repudiation of  Pamyat or of omni-present Jew-baiting. Last  year, when Mr. Kanovich,  joined by  two  members of the Academy of Sciences, Vitaly  Ginzburg and Oleg Gazenko, submitted to  the presidium of the Congress of People's  Deputies a petition calling for a condemnation of anti-Semitism, and for creating a  special committee to follow up on the issue,  the petition was buried.

As our constituents turn  to us for guidance, we must be pre pared to provide leadership as well as  adequate answers to their questions.  One such answer lies in our Nation's  youth. It we can develop a nation of  energy-literate students we  are one  step closer to a citizenry of informed  adults.  I  rise  today,  along with  a  number of my colleagues, to assist in  this energy education effert by intro ducing a joint resolution to designate  March 23,  1990 as National Energy  Education Day.  Congress  launched NEED  in 1980.  Since then, the project has grown to  include 38 State committees and over  150 regional committees.

Based on the theory that students  retain more knowledge when actively  engaged, NEED incorporates coopera tive  learning and  the most current  educational research into a year-round  study of energy  topics.  In addition,  students use NEED as a vehicle  to  heighten their community's awareness  of many complex energy issues.

111,House,101,-0.023,1181,1,Mr. CONTE.," Mr.  Speaker,  one  Member  after another got up  last  week to bash the President's budget.  The noted budget philosopher and  social critic Mr. Russo let us know in  his immortal words that it ""stinks and  lies."" The powerful chairman of the  House Budget Committee said Presi dent Bush is ""playing games with the  budget."" A thoughtful Member from  Kansas  told us  that  the President  wanted to kill Tiny Tim.  The critics say this budget's spend ing priorities are wrong. They say it's  full of smoke and mirrors. And they  say if they were in charge, that would  all change. We'd get us the cleanest,  tightest,  deficit  reducingest  budget  we've ever seen.  Well, last fall they were in charge.  And what did we get? Last November's  reconciliation bill-a scandalous meas ure  full  of  sham  savings,  special  favors, one-time revenues and mystery  amendments nobody ever saw or ex amined. Moving agriculture deficiency  payments  from  fiscal  year 1990  to  fiscal year 1989. Delaying Medicare  payments for 2 days to claim a half  billion dollar savings. Shifting the post  office  off-budget,  for  $1.7  billion.  Those clouds of  smoke and  jagged  chunks of mirror made up a quarter of  the savings.  That was the best part of it.  The worst was sequestration. And  the Budget Committee-the home of  the  loudest  bashers  of  this  year's  budget-stood by and let  it happen.  Committees  that  failed or even  re fused to meet their savings targets like Merchant Marine and Fisheries  with the Coast Guard user fee-got off  scot free, and committees which met  their targets got hit with a sequester.  Maternal and child health care,  re search on cancer, student aid-they all  got hit. That bill was a shame and a  scandal on the whole Congress.  Now, this year's budget isn't perfect.  No one expects it to be perfect-it's  the first step in a year-long process.  We all have an interest, and we all  want to change it in our own way.  That's fine. But nobody's going to  get anything done by standing here at tacking the President of the United  States and pretending the Ways and  Means Committee or the Budget Com mittee is as pure as driven snow.  Let's cut the nonsense, get off the  soapbox and get to work.

117,House,101,-0.308,1233,1,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  first  would like to thank Chairman ANDER SON  for his expeditious handling of  this bill. Plans are afoot to allow the  American-Soviet Youth Orchestra to  perform on the Capitol Grounds. A lot  of preliminary work, preparatory work  has to be undertaken. It is very impor tant that we get  this permission as  soon as possible.  Chairman ANDERSON has been very,  very helpful in moving this bill for ward.  As has been said by other speakers,  the American-Soviet Youth Orchestra  is sponsored by the Conservatory of  Music at Oberlin College, which is in  my district, and by the Moscow Con servatory of Music and the Soviet Min istry of Culture.  Its mission is  to help young musi cians and  their  audiences  to  learn  from each other and to live together  in  the same spirit of harmony that  their music engenders.  First Lady Barbara Bush  is  the  American honorary chairperson of the  orchestra,  as  you have heard,  and  Raisa Gorbachev  is  the  honorary  Soviet chairperson.  Mr. Speaker, this is the second year  that the finest young musicians from  both the United States and the Soviet  Union will be selected for the orches tra, which will make concert tours in  both countries.  This year in the United States, for  example, they will be playing here in  Washington and in my hometown of  Oberlin, also at Epcot Center and at  the Hollywood Bowl.  In many communities where  they  perform, the musicians join with the  local educational and other  institu tions to give chamber ensembles and  master classes.  The effort is intended to reach and  influence  a  grass-roots  constituency  and  to  familiarize  people  through  music with language, the customs and  political systems of another country.  D 1330  The orchestra does need the permis sion of Congress to perform on the left  lawn.  This  concurrent  resolution  simply provides that permission, and  does not have funding as an objective.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to  thank the gentleman from California  [Mr. ANDERSON] and his committee for  their expeditious  treatment of  this  resolution. I  just want to say that I  think  this  is a  small but important  step toward increasing understanding  between  the United States and  the  Soviet Union. As we all know, there  ",1990
118,House,101,0.371,1246,1,Mr. THOMAS of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself 6 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, let me rise in support  of a piece of legislation which is less  than its critics have claimed it to be,  and, frankly, more than some of its  supporters believe it to be. It is a piece  of legislation which, although compre hensive at the Federal level, provides a  significant amount of individual deci sionmaking for States and areas where  clearly  the States should have  that  kind of individual decisionmaking.  I, too, as my colleagues, the gentle man from Washington CMr. SWIFT],  the chairman of  the subcommittee,  with whom I have enjoyed a long and  mostly positive working relationship,  feel compelled primarily to talk about  what this bill is not, since most of the  criticisms of the bill are in fact criti cisms which the bill does not deserve.  For-example, I would urge all my col leagues to be very, very careful about  material that has been disseminated in  terms of cost. There  is  in fact one  piece of  information  from  a  study  group which says that the cost of H.R.  2190  to  the Federal Government  is  $200 million. If we would examine the  documents, I think we would find that  the actual amount is $200,000.  Now, we are often accused of drop ping zeroes in spending money in various areas, but I would hope that when  we report on this bill, we would under stand that it is not a $200 million cost  but a $200,000 cost.  During debate on the rule there was  an accusation that the bill is virtually  useless because of its vagueness, for  example, in section 106. There is no  specificity  in  terms of  the kinds of  criminal  convictions  under  which  someone would be denied the right to  vote. There was a discussion about the  fact that if they meant a felony, they  should have said, ""a felony,"" and if  they meant  a misdemeanor,  they  should have said, ""a misdemeanor.""  They said this bill is too vague to be of  any use, ""and look at all the mandat ing that is required.""  I would urge my colleagues to read  the entire section in dealing with the  information on death, criminal convic tion, or mental incapacity, because it  is stated over and over again in the  bill, after that kind of vital statistic in formation is transmitted to the official  voter registration list for adjustment,  it is under State law. The decision as  to which criminal conviction removes  someone from the voting list is to be  determined under State  law. What  kind of mental incapacity is to be de termined as to what removes someone  from the voter list is to be determined  under State law.  If someone wants to argue that we  are vague in that area, I guess they  can argue on a specificity basis that we  are vague. We do not have the Federal  Government dicatating what specific  criminal convictions are going to keep  someone  from  or  remove  someone  from the voter list. We had no inten tion of doing that. We had no inten tion of involving ourselves in an area  where the State ought to make that  decision, and in fact the bill says that  the States should make that decision.  We also had some of our colleagues  upset by the fact that in their particu lar States fishing and hunting licenses  are sold at 7-Eleven's and other kinds  of convenience outlets, and that all of  a sudden the Federal Government is  mandating that the local 7-Eleven reg ister voters. I would entertain some one's examination of the bill and the  terminology that was used in an at tempt to get government agencies to  involve themselves in the voter regis tration area, requiring absolute neu trality under Federal penalty of law,  in a neutral way offering the opportu nity to register people, not in private  enterprise areas, but for example, as  the bill says, in ""fishing and hunting  bureaus,"" agencies of the government.  Now, we have an outreach program  for the private sector to be involved if  they so wish. In California we have  been able  to  involve fast food  fran chises and outlets  in a  number of  other areas in offering an opportunity  to  register people  to vote.  I  think,  given today's lifestyle of people, it is  not  inappropriate  that  the Govern ment try to be as outreaching and for ward-looking as possible, including the  private sector, in extending people an  opportunity to register.  Mr. Chairman,  another complaint  levied against the bill is that it is sup posed to increase voter turnout, and  some say, ""We really don't think it is  supposed to increase voter turnout or  we don't think it will."" I will ask them  to turn to the purposes of the Act. No.  1, it says, ""to increase registration of  citizens as voters."" It is not that the  registered voters are necessarily going  to turn out.  I say to my colleagues that I think  we have a vast amount of work to do  in the area of an honest and fair ap portionment, in the area of campaign  finance, and in putting back into the  picture local people so they can feel as  though they have a chance to influ ence an election. All of those are items  that would affect turnout.  What  this bill  intends  to do and  indeed does is to get people in a con venient way registered and, more im portantly,  in an orderly fashion,  re moved from the rolls so that what we  have are accurate rolls. I think a rea sonable program to get people to vote  is to, first of all, have an accurate roll  from which  one  can make  those  choices, not one which is exceedingly  difficult to get on or impossible to get  off, but one which is reasonable and  orderly in putting people on and rea sonable and orderly in removing them.

120,House,101,-0.446,1246,1,Mr. MFUME.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman from Washington CMr.  SWIFT] for yielding time to me, and I  rise  in very  strong support of  the  measure before us today.  Mr. Chairman, I join my colleagues in strong  support of this momentous and historic piece  of legislation, H.R. 2190, the Voter Registra tion Act of 1989. This bill will make voter reg istration more accessible  to  the . millions of  Americans who, for a number of reasons, do  not have the means to register.  Five years ago we celebrated the 20th anni versary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to  mark the significant progress we have made  in allowing our citizenry  the opportunity  to  vote. With the passage of the 1965 act, many  blatant and  sinister obstacles administered  through  the  repressive Jim Crow  laws were  dismantled. Yet, today many Americans-par ticularly minorities and  low-income persons are still locked out of the electoral process as  other impediments prevent full participation in  the electoral process on election day.  Mr. Chairman, the United States has one of  the worst voter turnout records among indus trialized nations.  In  the Presidential election  year of 1984, only 53.1 percent of the voting  age went to the ballot box, and in 1986 only  37.1 percent. And only 50.8 percent of the  population voted in the last Presidential elec",1990
121,House,101,-0.578,1259,1,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support  of H.R. 2190, the National Voter Registration  Act, which seeks to remove existing barriers  to voter registration, and encourage eligible in dividuals to register to vote.  In the 1988 Presidential election, voter turn out was only 50 percent of  the U.S. voting  age population. The United States consistently  has the lowest voter participation rates among  the Western democratic nations. Even in de veloping nations, such as Namibia, where the  people had to walk for miles, and stand in line  for hours under the broiling sun, to vote in a  free  election,  voter participation  rates  are  higher than the United States. The participa tion rate in the recent election in Namibia was  over 90 percent.  Today, 60 million Americans are not regis tered to vote. As democracy spreads across  the world,  throughout Eastern Europe, and  indeed, even into the Soviet Union, we must  make every effort to remove barriers to par ticipation  in our great democracy.  If we are  intent on  remaining  the shining beacon of  freedom and democracy that has inspired mil lions of immigrants to come to  this  land  for  over 200 years, then we must open the voting  booth to every American.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2190 will encourage  voter  registration by making  the  registration  process as easy and quick as possible, while  ensuring the  integrity of the voting rolls and  the election process. H.R. 2190 will mandate  mail-in  registration, and  registration at many  Federal and State offices, such as public  li braries,  public assistance offices,  city and  county clerks' offices,  and  public  schools.  H.R. 2190 also provides for a process known  as motor-voter registration, which would allow  citizens to register to vote when applying for  or renewing their driver's license.  Each of the registration methods called for  in  the bill  is a proven method of increasing  registration  in a efficient and cost-effective  manner. Linking voting registration with appli cation for a driver's license would reach about  90 percent of the voting age population.  This bill will not  increase voter  fraud, as  some opponents have claimed. Many of these  opponents used this same argument 25 years  ago, in the debate over the Voting Rights Act,  which  eliminated  discriminatory  registration  practices, and extended  the right to vote to  many black Americans  for  the  first  time.  In  fact, several features of the bill would actually  decrease the likelihood of voter fraud, includ ing  the  requirement  that  the voting  lists be  verified periodically.  In addition,  the bill  in cludes penalties  for people who  fraudulently  register.  In short, Mr. Chairman,  this will make  tre mendous progress  toward  increasing voting  registration and  voter participation.  It  is a  measure which is long overdue.  ",1990
122,House,101,-0.308,1259,1,Mr. BRENNAN.," Mr. Chairman,  I urge my  colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 2190,  the National Voter Registration Act.  This  measure,  in expanding opportunities for eligi ble  individuals  to  vote,  eliminates barriers  individuals  which now stand between many  and the voting polls.  The  right  to vote  in a Federal election  is  guaranteed  in  the Constitution. By putting  Federal and State Government in  the active  position of encouraging individuals to register  to vote, we further enhance that constitutional  right.  In  the past Presidential election,  studies  found  that only 50 percent of eligible voters  chose to cast a ballot. While I recognize that  many citizens freely choose not to vote, we  must ensure all available efforts are made to  lessen barriers which deter voting. This is not  a Democrat  or Republican  issue-but an  American issue. The values we hold so impor tant can only be secured through the electoral  process. This  legislation helps  to promote  greater voter participation-a goal we should  all share.  In my own State of Maine, we have proven,  through our policy of same-day  registration,  that citizens who  register are citizens who  vote. By linking voter registration with driver's  license application, over 90 percent of those  eligible to vote would be given ample opportu nity to do so. Alternately, mail registration and  on-site registration would give nondrivers the  opportunity to register and vote.  The National Association of Secretaries of  State, who oversee  the processes of voter  registration  in  their  respective States, have  endorsed this legislation as one that is work able.  I enclose  for  the  record a letter from  Maine's secretary of state, G. William Dia mond, in support of H.R. 2190.  I urge my colleagues to join me in support  of this legislation.  STATE OF MAINE,  OFFICE OF SECRETARY OF STATE,  Augusta, ME, January 29, 1990.  Hon. JosEPH E. BRENNAN,  Longworth House Office Building, Washing ton, DC.  DEAR JoE: I have been informed that the  Universal Voter Registration Act  <H.R.  2190) will be up for a vote on either Tuesday  or Wednesday of this week.  I believe this legislation to be long over due and would hope that you might consid er supporting it.  In sum, I find it a very positive initiative  which will not only assist  the disinfran chised  and  unregistered  in Maine,  but  Maine's numerous  elections' officials  as  well.  Thank you for your consideration-please  call if you have any questions.  Sincerely,  G. WILLIAM DIAMOND,  Secretary of State.  ",1990
123,House,101,0.208,1259,1,Mrs. MEYERS of Kansas.," Mr. Chairman,  rise to express my strong support for efforts  to increase voter registration and voter partici pation in the United States.  Any democracy has as  its  foundation an  active, well-informed electorate.  It should be  the goal of the States and the Federal Gov ernment to encourage registration and partici pation.  This is why I will vote for H.R. 2190, the Na tional Voter Registration Act. But while  I will  vote for the bill, and while  I strongly support  voter outreach efforts, I do have reservations  about four of the bill's provisions.  The section of the bill of primary concern to  me would  require States to designate State  offices and agencies as voter registration lo cations. Included in the bill's list of these reg istration  locations are State offices selling  hunting and fishing licenses.  In some parts of Kansas, hunting and fish ing licenses are sold at bars and bait shops.  While proponents of the bill say that States  would have discretion  in designating  these  registration points, opponents say that the bill  language would not allow State discretion.  I believe this section of the bill should be  clarified to ensure that the States can desig nate the State agencies and offices they con sider necessary and appropriate voter regis tration locations.  I would also prefer that the motor-voter pro visions of the bill would not automatically reg ister those who apply for a driver's license.  A better system, in my view, would attach a  separate voter registration application  to the  driver's license application. An individual wish ing  to  register  to vote could  then sign  the  voter application and be registered.  Whatever the procedure,  I believe that an  individual should demonstrate some small in dication of interest to show that the right to  vote means enough to him  that he will  take  action on his own.  I am also concerned  that  this bill prohibit  States from retaining some previously enacted  antifraud laws, including requiring notarization  of signatures.  Voter fraud is not a problem in Kansas, but  it certainly has been in other States. And the  individual States know best how  to prevent  the particular kind of fraud in their areas.  And  finally, Mr. Chairman,  I want  to relay  the concerns of my secretary of state, who  wonders how he will pay for the extra book keeping and computerizing this bill would re quire.  The State of Kansas will have to spend ap proximately $1.3 million to comply with the bill.  It  is unlikely  that  the $50 million  in Federal  funds authorized by the bill will cover the cost  to  the States-cost incurred complying with  Federal mandates.  So while I believe this bill is a good one, I  also believe it can be improved greatly in the  Senate  or  in House-Senate  conference.  I  hope the final version of the bill provide the  States with the flexibility they need to adminis ter the Federal election laws.  The CHAIRMAN.

125,,101,0.581,1272,1,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, I think  the House may want to look carefully  at this motion to recommit, because it  really does speak to the question a lot  of Members  have  about  this  bill.  Namely, the possibility of fraud. This  particular motion  to  recommit  sug gests that we ought to tighten up the  fraud provisions in the bill  in three  specific ways: No. 1, we ought to have  better mail verification, which would  permit State officials to require verifi cation of information on mail registra tion forms; second, under this particular motion, what we would  do  is  remove the middleman, assuring that  nonelection officials, middlemen, so to  speak, would not be processing voter  applications; third, under this bill, we  have the election crimes that would  actually be specified. It adds specific  fraudulent activities to the list of Fed eral voting crimes of bribery,  filing  false election information, and postal  fraud. These are all things that if they  were adopted, we think would tighten  up the ability of this bill to have voter  registration without potential fraud.  ",1990
126,,101,0.371,1272,1,Mr. THOMAS of California.," Mr.  Speaker, as most Members know, I am  in support of the bill, and I was op posed to the en bloc amendments.  As Members examine the specific in structions under the motion to recom mit, I think Members will find there  are six specific instructions under the  motion  to  recommit. Two of  them  have to do with specifics that are con tained in the bill itself. The four that  come under  the enforcement provi sion,  before Members  stand  up,  I  would say and argue that this is some thing similar to the en bloc amend ments if they are basically going to  gut the bill. I would caution Members  that  the  four  specific  instructions  under the motion to recommit on en forcement were contained in S. 1711, a  bill which passed the U.S. Senate on  October 5, 1989, 100 to 0.  I have attempted to try to maintain  a bipartisan position on this side. The  Senate, in a bipartisan acceptance of  the enforcement provisions in a bill on  the Senate  side,  S.  1711,  believed  unanimously that these were reasona ble enforcement provisions.  ",1990

128,Senate,101,0.361,1298,1,Mr. BURNS.," Mr. President, I  rise  today on an issue that is near and dear  to the hearts of all Americans. I rise  today to congratulate the Governor of  Montana, Stan Stephens, for signing a  proclamation recognizing this week as    ""Firearms Ownership Week,"" and  it  will be recognized as such in Montana.  This  proclamation  brings  to  the  awareness of Montanans of not only  the constitution in the State of Mon tana  but  the Constitution  of  the  United States of America. It is one of  those sacred rights that has kept this  society  and  this Nation  strong  for  some 200 years plus.  As we go down through history and  we recognize what is going on in the  world around us, we  recognize  that  these rights are sacred and should be  upheld at all times, those constitution al rights and the recognition of the  Governor of Montana, I applaud him  for his actions in this proclamation.  I yield the floor.  THE CLEAN AIR ACT  ",1990
129,Senate,101,0.31,1298,1,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, I am very  pleased the Senate has begun debate  on the reauthorization of the Clean  Air Act. I applaud the President for  making it a top priority and I applaud  him also for his initiative to increase  substantially the planting of trees in  this Nation which can have an important impact and a favorable impact on  the quality of our air and of our envi ronment.  Mr. President, I represent a beauti ful State. We want to protect it and  preserve it for our children and their  children. Missourians want clean air  and I share that goal and I am here to  work for it.  The bill before us is S. 1630, report ed in December by the Senate Envi ronment and Public Works Commit tee. It regulates a tremendous variety  of air emissions with complex regula tory schemes and ambitious deadlines.  It would toughen current laws regulat ing auto tailpipe emissions and pollu tion in highly urban areas. It would es tablish new regulatory programs for  the control of sulfur dioxide emissions  from utility plants <acid rain) and haz ardous air emissions from manuf actur ing facilities. S. 1630 would also regu late emissions from municipal inciner ators. Finally,  it would  require  the  phaseout of the production and use of  all chlorofluorocarbons.  Mr. President, while I am strongly  supportive of clean air legislation, I  have some concerns about this specific  bill which I would like to outline.  My first concern is  title IV, which  creates a new and far-reaching acid  rain control program. This issue has  been debated for a long, long time. We  need to get it behind us and Missouri  is willing to do its fair share.  I would like to note however that we  are acting on the problem before we  receive a final report of the National  Acid  Precipitation Assessment  Pro gram. The report is due in September.  It seems unfortunate and a little bit  strange to me that after we spent $400  ",1990
130,Senate,101,-0.142,1324,1,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, I  first  compliment my colleague from Con necticut for the remarks he just made.  I  associate myself with his  remarks  both about the merits of the bill and  also about  the particular merits of  title X which he explained in great  detail and great accuracy and clarity.  Mr. President, I am often asked as  chairman of the Intelligence Commit tee to name the greatest threat to the  national  security  interests  of  the  United States.  For many, many years I think that a  person in my position when answering  that question would have talked about  the nature of the Soviet threat, would  have talked about the missile threat  aimed  against  this  country, would  have  talked about the power of the  Warsaw Pact to launch a conventional  attack across the borders of Western  Europe and Eastern Europe. We would  have thought of our national security  interest in terms of ability to garner  intelligence  in  terms of balance of  military forces.  Mr. President, with all the changes  that are taking place in the world, in cluding the incredible debate that is  now taking place in Moscow, even as  we meet today, in terms of a restruc turing of the Communist Party of the  Soviet Union, the changes that have  occurred in Eastern Europe, seeing the  virtual  elimination  of  the Warsaw  Pact as a military force to be reckoned  with, if I were to be asked that ques tion today, I would answer it very dif ferently  than  those who were my  predecessors would have answered it 5  or 10 years ago.  I would have to say that the greatest  threat to the national security of the  United States  is  represented  in our  failure to fully develop the human re sources of  this country. We under stand that the Soviet Union has been  a  in  the military  sense. It is not an economic superpow er. It is certainly not a superpower in  terms of the appeal of its philosophy  to the rest of the world. What we have  sometimes failed to understand is that  there has been an ironic and symbolic  relationship between  the power and  influence of the United States in the  world and the power and influence of  the Soviet Union.  Now that the military threat from  the Soviet Union is perceived as rapid ly declining by the other nations of  the world, we have  to  realize  that  those nations will no longer automati cally be so anxious to follow the lead  of  the United States  in matters of  international importance. The NATO  countries were willing  to follow our  lead  because  they were  concerned  about the Soviet threat and the threat  from  the Warsaw Pact  and  they  wanted the protection offered by the  shield of American military strength.  In  the Orient,  the Japanese were  perfectly content to spend only about  one-seventh the proportion of military  expenditures as we were spending in  this  country but  they wanted  the  shield of American military protec tion. And they were willing to follow  our lead  in international matters of  ~uperpower only  great importance because they wanted  to continue to benefit from that Amer ican military protection against what  they perceived as the threat from the  Soviet Union and  the Eastern bloc.  Now that they are no longer so con cerned about  that  threat,  they are  going to be much less willing to follow  the lead of the United States in world  affairs.  How  then will  the United States  reassert its role in the world? What  kind of role, Mr. President, will we  play in world affairs in the 21st centu ry? The 20th century in many ways  has been the American century. It has  been American ideas and ideals that  moved the world to change. It was a  symbol of this country, the Statue of  Liberty, that was raised in Tiananmen  Square that moved the world to sup port student demands for change in  that country. It was American  ideas  and ideals used by Lech Walesa, when  he began his speech to us at the joint  session of Congress, with  the words  ""We, the people."" That further moved  the world to support change in East ern Europe.  But what of our role in the next cen tury? In the next century, the influ ence of this country will have to be ex erted in different ways,  in terms of  moral  influence  of  our  ideas  and  ideals;  it will have  to be exerted in  terms of hopefully major exchange  programs between our students and  students of other nations so that we  can teach the next generation of lead ers in other nations of the world about  our system of government, our form of  society,  our  sense  of  fairness  and  human dignity. But it also will rest  upon the ability of the United States  to protect economic growth.  Mr. President, we are in a far differ ent situation than we were in 1950, for  example, when we still had great mili tary strength, indeed almost a monop oly on military strength in the world,  and we  led the world in a way that  perhaps no other nation has ever led it  in history. At that time we had the 10  largest banks in the world. Today, we  do not have any of the top 20 banks in  the world. At that time, we had a 68percent share of the world's assets and  almost  a  70-percent  share  of  the  world's markets. Today, our share of  the value of world assets is about 20  percent and our share of world mar kets is about the same.  So if we are going into a totally new  world environment in which the influ ence of this country is no longer going  to be founded upon and based upon  our military strength but upon our  economic  strength  and  our moral  strength, what  then must we do  to  equip ourselves for this world that we  are going to be living in in the 21st  century,  for example,  if we have a  dropout rate in this country of 29 per cent of all of our 18-year-olds who do  ",1990
131,Senate,101,-0.352,1337,1,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I rise in  strong support of S. 169, the National  Global Change Research Act of 1989. I  am pleased to have worked with Sena tor HOLLINGS on the development of  this very  important  legislation  that  will  enhance our knowledge of  the  greenhouse effect and ozone depletion  by requiring a  long-term coordinated  research effort.  Scientific uncertainty on global cli mate  issues has  led  to an  intense  debate and has hampered efforts  to  set policy. Researchers agree that con centrations  of  carbon  dioxide  and  other greenhouse gases in the atmos phere raise the temperatures of the  Earth and that the concentrations of  these gases are increasing from burn ing fossil fuels. But scientific predic tions of the magnitude of the tempera ture rise range from 3 or 4 degrees  Fahrenheit to as much as 9 degrees.  And the timeline varies from already  occurring to the middle of the next  century.  Despite some uncertainties, there is  overwhelming consensus  that global  warming  is  a  serious problem  and  action to address this cannot wait. The  potentially alarming consequences, in cluding droughts,  flooding,  and sea  level  rise, as well as  the associated  health risks, cannot possibly be trans lated into a research-only attitude for  responsible scientists and policymak ers. The U.N. Environmental Program  and the World Meteorological Organi zation have already organized repre sentatives  of  30  countries  into  an  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change CIPCCl  to develop a strategy  on global climate change.  Here  in  the United States, nearly  half of the National Academy of Sci ences joined with 49 Nobel laureates  to urge President Bush  to  take  the  threat of global climate change seri ously and to begin to take action. In  addition,  the President's own policy  advisers have suggested a greater need  for  action. Unfortunately, President  Bush once again fell short of his cam paign promises and  failed  to  show  leadership in his address to the IPCC  yesterday where he committed only to  study  the problem and not  to  take  action. This is reminiscent of the past  decade when the Reagan administra tion refused to acknowledge that the  country was suffering from acid rain  and  insisted on study versus action.  Will we have to wait for another 10  years of administration-backed studies  before we see any real progress on this  devastating problem?  The Clean Air Act will  give  the  Senate an opportunity to show some  real  leadership by  taking actions  to  curb greenhouse gases.  I hope  that  yesterday's speech by  the President  does not undermine the Senate's ef forts to keep these strong provisions in  the clean air bill  that  is currently  pending before Congress.  There  is a greater consensus  that  chlorofluorocarbons  CCFC'sl  and  other manmade chemicals destroy the  Earth's stratospheric ozone layer. This  ozone  layer shields  the Earth from  harmful radiation. Not only has this  effect been substantiated, but it has  been measured. While it was once be lieved that ozone destruction was con fined to areas over Antarctica, we now  know that this is a problem over popu lated regions of the Earth, leading to  increased incidences of cancer. About  50 nations have now signed the 1987  Montreal Protocol that sets  interna tional targets for reducing these com pounds. I am pleased that the Senate  clean air bill goes beyond the Montre al Protocol in phasing out ozone-de stroying chemicals.  One of science's greatest challenges  will be to provide the information nec essary  to develop sound policies on  global change. The  task  is difficult,  but as a member of the Senate Global  Environmental Task Force and  the  Senate Commerce Committee,  I  am  committed to seeing that the United  States leads the way. This very impor tant piece  of  legislation moves  us  closer to scientifically sound policies  by setting national priorities and es tablishing national goals  for global  change research.  ",1990
132,Senate,101,0.287,1363,1,Mr. COCHRAN.,"  This  amendment  incorporates  the  thrust of my legislation-the Student  Athlete Right-to-Know Act-as report ed by the Senate Labor and Human  Resources Committee.  Mr. President, we  have all heard  about both the highlights and pitfalls  of participating in intercollegiate ath letics. Many high school and college  athletes dream of playing for a Divi sion I team and, perhaps, of a profes sional sports career. Yet only 1 out of  every 100 high school athletes will re ceive a scholarship to play at a Divi sion I college. Most of those lucky few  can expect a pressure-packed environ ment where academics and athletics  collide in a world with heavy demands  and  little  time. And even  fewer of  those who do play in this high pres sure league will ever make it to the  pros. In 1986, 12,000 men played col lege basketball, but only  161 were  drafted by the NBA. Of the 161 who  were drafted, only a few will play more  than 3 or 4 years.  Single-minded devotion to athletics  among our Nation's schools and colleges  can  lead  to  exploitation  and  abuse  of  the  student  athlete. The  result can be a  sad story. Too  fre quently the student athlete, failing his  or her courses or not carrying a full  course load, exhausts eligibility, loses  an athletic scholarship, and drops out  of school-with no education, no train ing, and only a few memories for com fort. A  recent General Accounting  Office report indicated that the grad uation rate of basketball and football  student athletes who attend division I  schools is very poor. It is my under standing that at one division I institu tion, the graduation rate was a pathet ic 7 percent for students on basketball  scholarships  during  the  decade  of  1972-83.  Mr.  President,  that  should  not  happen. With the proper balance be tween academics and athletics, sports  can provide the means to an education  that might otherwise be unattainable.  Many athletes have applied the disci pline of the arena  to  the classroom  and have gone on to satisfying careers.  We need more success stories built on  good habits and opportunities seized.  That is why I  introduced the Stu dent Athlete Right-to-Know Act  in  the Senate. This is a consumer inf or mation bill for student athletes and  their families. Student athletes about  to enter college should be consumers  of  education  and  participants  in  sports, if our priorities are in order. As  such, they are entitled to the relevant  and basic consumer information that  is an essential element of an informed  choice. The choice of which college or  university to attend is likely to be one  of the most important decisions of a  young person's life. A potential stu dent athlete and his or her family are  entitled to a direct an valid answer to  the question, ""If I enter your college  or university as a freshman on an ath eltic scholarship in my sport, what are  the  chances  that  I  will  graduate  within a year of those in my entering  class?""  This amendment  requires  colleges  and universities to report graduation  rates,  including the graduation rates  of student athletes broken down by  sport, race, and sex and the proportion  of students who earn a degree within 5  years, reported by sport, ra.ce, and sex.  The information is to be made avail able to high school student athletes,  their families, and high school guid ance counselors and principals, to aid  the student athletes as  they choose  the schools they will attend.  Mr. President, since the legislation  was reported by the Labor Committee,  the NCAA  in January-in a  nearly  unanimous  vote-adopted  require ments consistent with this legislation.  I applaud their action. But while the  NCAA  action  is  important, Federal  legislation  is  still  needed  because  many  student athletes don't go  to  ",1990

134,Senate,101,0.275,1415,1,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President,  today  I  am  introducing  legislation  along with Senators DECONCINI and  COATS which,  if enacted, will benefit  the law enforcement community and  save  the  taxpayers' money. My bill  will provide full law enforcement au thority to all criminal investigators in  the Offices  of  Inspector General  COIGJ. Full law enforcement authority  includes making arrests,  issuing  search warrants and carrying firearms.  I currently serve, Mr. President, as a  Commissioner on the National Adviso ry Commission on Law Enforcement,  as do Senator DECONCINI and Senator  COATS. The Commission was  estab lished by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of  1988 to study pay, benefits, and other  issues related to the recruitment, re tention, and morale of Federal law en forcement officers. One of the recom mendations of the Commission is re lated to the belief that it is difficult to  recruit and retain criminal investiga tors for the OIG's because they lack  full law enforcement authority.  By law, the statutory OIG's are all  charged with  responsibility  for con ducting investigations of programs and  operations in their agencies. Although  the statutory law enforcement respon sibilities of all OIG's are  identical,  they do not have uniform authorities  to exercise  law enforcement powers.  At present, the OIG's employ approxi mately  1,900  criminal  investigators  CGS-181l'sl. Fewer than half of these  special agents exercise some  limited  form of enforcement powers through  existing or delegated authority.  Like ""traditional"" law enforcement  agencies  [FBI, DEA,  IRS, Customs,  Secret Service-whose criminal investi gators  are  also GS-181l'sl,  special  agents of the statutory OIG's investi gate fraud, public corruption and re lated offenses. Like the traditional law  enforcement  agencies,  they  conduct  their investigations through review of  records,  use  of  informants,  surveil lance,  undercover  operations,  ap proved  electronic  monitoring  and  interviews with hostile witnesses and  subjects. These investigative subjects  and witnesses are often  involved  in  narcotics sales, illegal weapons trans actions and other activities commonly  associated with violent crimes such as  assault and battery, unlawful use of a  weapon, rape, murder, resisting arrest  and extortion.  Unless employees of traditional law  enforcement agencies, Mr. President,  OIG special agents must  frequently  enter high-crime areas to gather inf or mation or serve subpoenas without the  protection of firearms. Frequently, in formants or witnesses who cooperate  with the Government require protec tion, or an investigator must monitor a  meeting between an informant and a  subject.  Sometimes suspects attempt to flee,  known  fugitives are encountered or  subjects admit  to crimes during an  interview, and OIG agents are unable  to arrest them or take other immedi ate action to detain them. More often,  cases were unreasonably delayed or  agents placed  themselves at risk by  acting in the absence of full law en forcement authority.  ",1990
135,,101,-0.631,1467,1,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, to date, over 71  Members of the House have sponsored H.R.  3880, the Medicare Benefit Improvements Act  of 1990.  The bill would provide new mammography,  hospice, home health, and respite care bene fits to the Medicare program.  The bill is endorsed by the National Alliance  of Breast Cancer Organizations. Following  is  their letter which helps explain the importance  of this legislation:  JANUARY 18, 1990.  Hon. FORTNEY P. STARK,  Chairman, Subcommittee on Health, Wash ington, DC.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN STARK: We have been  informed that you and Congressmen Gradi son and Waxman plan  to  introduce The  Medicare Benefit Improvements Act of 1990  1465  in the second session of the lOlst Congress,  legislation that would provide Medicare re imbursement for screening mammography.  The National Alliance of Brea.st Cancer Or ganizations and our 180 member organiza tions across the country wish to extend our  congratulations, and our support.  As you know, breast cancer has reached  epidemic proportions in the United States,  striking one out of  ten women. It is  the  most  common  form  of  cancer  among  women, and until 1986, it was the leading  cause of death from cancer in women. In  1989, there were an estimated 143,000 new  cases of breast cancer. La.st year, approxi mately 43,000 American women died from  the disease, the majority of them over 55  years of age. The premature death of a  women from cancer is always tragic. Yet the  greatest tragedy of all is that many of these  deaths could have been prevented  if  the  cancer has been detected earlier.  We have the technology to detest breast  cancer when  it  is  still  in  its very early  stages. Mammography is a highly safe and  reliable procedure which can detect tumors  before they can be felt-when the chances  of cure are over 90%. Yet very few women  undergo regular mammography screening,  and currently, many insurance policies do  not cover  the cost of mammography for  screening purposes.  For more than a decade, scientists have  known that diagnosing and treating a breast  malignancy when  it  is preclinical <micro scopic) and non-palpable <too small to be  felt) will save the lives of thousands of our  female citizens. A randomized screening pro gram conducted by the Health Insurance  Plan of New York in the 1960s proved that  the 10-year death rates of women older than  50 who were  diagnosed  to  have  breast  cancer after being examined by mammogra phy and a clinical examination, were more  than 30% lower than those of women who  were examined but not mammographed. In  November 1987, these life-saving benefits of  mammography  were  described  Dr.  Myron Moscowitz, director of a screening  center in Cincinnati, at a hearing before the  House Subcommittee  on Health  of  the  Ways and Means Committee.  If these life-saving benefits of mammogra phy have already been proven, why are  about 50% of new patients diagnosed after  the cancer has already spread? This ques tion was answered by several polls conduct ed by the American Cancer Society and the  American College of Radiology. Most doc tors are reluctant to order mammography  because of its cost <as high as $200), while  radiologists-the  specialists who  interpret  mammograms-argue that dedicated equip ment, the salaries of trained and certified  technologists, supplies and overhead are the  same, whether they do one mammographic  examination each day or 50. It is a proverbi al vicious circle: women are not being re f erred  for mammography because of  its  high cost; the reason the examination is so  expensive is that too few women are being  screened.  Cost containment is the argument which  can defeat proposed mandatory coverage for  breast  screening,  even  though  this  is  a  penny-wise and pound-foolish policy: it costs  many more taxpayers' dollars to treat ad vanced breast cancer than it does to detect  the  disease  by mammography  screening  before it has spread. Of course, no dollar  value can be put on the pain, suffering and  premature death that inevitably follow a di agnosis of advanced breast cancer. It is im perative,  therefore, that all insurers cover  by  ",1990
136,,101,-0.27,1480,1,Mr. LEHMAN of California.," Mr. Speaker,  since 1987, California State University Fres no's Ag One booster  foundation has recog nized an outstanding member of the agribusi ness industry in a community salute. For sev eral years, the Ag One foundation has promot ed education excellence in agriculture through  awarding scholarships to outstanding students  majoring in the field of agriculture. In many re spects, the Ag One scholarships has been the  framework for helping to maintain interest by  students choosing a career in agriculture. The  foundation  continues  this  tradition with  the  outstanding agribusiness persons scholarship  endowment.  I am pleased to help the Ag One foundation  honor  the 1989  recipient of  this community  salute: Dick Markarian. For more  than  60  years, Dick has been a leader in our commu nity. No one has been a more forceful, articu late, and loyal advocate for Central Valley ag riculture than Dick Markarian.  Dick knows farming from the ground up. He  has been a fearless champion of farm issues  and causes as divergent as labor, water, pes ticides,  land use, and marketing orders. He  has counseled politicians and elected officials  at all  levels. All who know and have worked  with Dick  have  enormous  respect  for his  energy and commitment.  To me, Dick has been a supporter, a coun selor, a critic, and a friend. He can always be  counted on for an objective opinion. His only  bias is to do what's right for agriculture. You  can agree or disagree with Dick Markarian but you can't ignore him.  It is appropriate, and frankly over due, that  our community pay tribute to the contributions  Dick has made. The Ag One Scholarship En. dowment Fund is a fitting way to honor Dick  Markarian, and I am proud to play a small role  in helping to honor this outstanding agribusi nessman, friend, and community leader.

Our  parties  are  unifying  forces  which provide reliable, consistent, and  coherent  communication with  the  American voters. However, our parties  are losing the struggle for influence  because their hands are tied by contri bution limitations. Under the current  system, parties have no more ability to  make direct contributions to their own  nominees than special interest politi cal action committees.  Mr. Speaker, to strengthen our polit ical parties and ensure that more chal lengers can run competitive races, we  should remove all limits on political  parties' contributions  to candidates.  Of course, full disclosure and report ing to the Federal Election Commis sion must be required.  Let's take away the special interest  influence and give it back to our citi zen-based political parties, and there fore  to the American people, where  the power and accountability belong.

Today it is my pleasure to introduce  legislation that would extend this pro tection  to  the  lower portion of the  Merced River. This section was put in  as a study section by the lOOth Con gress so that the local county of Mari posa would have the opportunity to  develop a domestic water system com patible with the requirements of the  Wild and Scenic River Act. The legis lation I propose today would accom plish this goal.  This legislation is supported by the  Wilderness  Society,  the  Merced  Canyon  Committee,  the Mariposa  County Board of Supervisors and the  Mariposa County Water Agency.  The pristine quality of  the  lower  Merced River make it a worthy addi tion to the Wild and Scenic River Act  so that present and future generations  can enjoy and experience its beauty.

140,House,101,-0.351,77,7,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. Speaker, there  is even more bad news for the country  and  the American  taxpayer on  the  S&L bailout.  At the same time that the estimated  cost of the bailout is skyrocketing from a nightmarish $160 billion to an  unimaginable upper range of $500 bil lion-the President is planning to re place the one experienced manager we  have on the job. That would be a mis take.  William Seidman has been a voice of  integrity and intelligence in the cess pool of the S&L scandal.  Mr. Speaker, the country needs Mr.  Seidman  running FDIC more  than  ever. Without him, the costs are likely  to go even higher.  That  is why 23 members of  the  Banking Committee sent you a letter  yesterday, urging you to not let Mr.  Seidman leave.  Why should this country abandon  the service of one of the few credible  regulators who  have  experience  in  cleaning up the S&L mess?  When S&L time bombs are going off  all over the country we simply cannot  afford  the 6 months  to  train new  senior regulators, the people who must  defuse those time bombs.  It has been 9 months since the S&L  bailout was passed. In that time the  administration has ignored the prob lem as if it would go away if no one  paid attention.  I am deeply concerned that this ad ministration is blaming the messenger  for bad news. Getting rid of Mr. Seid man may temporarily cool the politi cal heat. But the fire will burn even  worse without him.

143,House,101,-0.358,90,7,Mr. BRYANT.," Madam Chairman, I  would like to first commend the gen tleman from New Jersey [Mr. RoE] for  his pioneering efforts in this area. I  believe history books will tell future  readers who was responsible for press ing forward in such an innovative area  that has caused such an enormous  contribution, which we  are on  the  verge of making today.  Madam Chairman,  the  supercon ducting super collider is the moon shot  of the 1990's. The fact of the matter is  it comes at a time when America's pre dominant role in the world scientific  community is threatened. What I am  speaking about is the fact that today  it is very appropriate we are taking up  the super collider issue, because the  front pages of newspapers all over  America read that the government of  Japan is targeting yet another Ameri can technology.  Today, the United States holds the  lead in the world in an advanced com puter technology known as massively  parallel processing, a software technol ogy that allow thousands of processors  to work together at high speeds.  D 1430  Now having achieved dominance in  supercomputing, the Japanese are now  announcing  that  they are  targeting  the United States in the area of paral lel processing. What does that have to  do with the SSC?  The fact of the matter is that the  project is one of the primary forces  driving progress in American parallel  processing efforts, and it will give us  vanguard  technology  in many other  areas as well.  I believe this will be the showcase  project of our Nation's science pro gram for the future, and it should be.  Building the collider will help preserve  America's technological lead, not only  in  the area of  the superconducting  super collider, but many others as  well.  Finally I want to make this point: A  superconducting super collider is going  to be built somewhere no matter what.  Two overseas accelerators with ca pacities greater  than America's cur rent largest, Fermilab, are currently in  the planning stages, one in the Soviet  Union and one in Switzerland. The su perconducting super collider would be  stronger  than  both,  if  built. But  should the Soviets or the Europeans  build  accelerators  and  the United  States decides not to build, the United  States will lose many of the world's  top scientists.  I  submit we have al ready received a great deal from the  super collider  research.  I  submit  it  would be false economy not to go for ward at this time and to keep our lead  in the area of scientific research in the  world.  ",1990
144,House,101,0.635,90,7,Mr. ARMEY.," Madam Chairman,  I want  to  take a few minutes to tell you why I strongly  support the SSC and will oppose attempts to  attach harmful amendments to H.R. 4380.  I  welcome  open  debate on  the SSC. This  project is eminently defensible and worthwhile.  In  fact  I would compare the SSC  to past  projects  in  its potential  to contribute  to the  betterment of our civilization and our under standing of the underlying principles of the  world which surrounds us. History books are  full of examples of similar excursions and ex plorations intended to expand the frontiers of  knowledge about our planet and beyond.  The Nation has a long tradition of support ing scientific research and exploration. For ex ample, President Jefferson sent Lewis and  Clark out West to explore the uncharted fron tier. The information they came back with pro vided the next generation of westward travel ers with a preview of  the conditions  they  would encounter, terrain, weather, and native  American tribes.  A more recent example is the Space Pro gram. President Eisenhower supported  the  creation of NASA to explore the wonders of  space. Each phase of NASA's existence has  built upon our knowledge and allowed our  country  to  lead  the way  into outer space.  Could our communications satellite systems  which benefit the entire Nation, and the world  for that matter, have been placed  into orbit  without the benefit of the scientific foundation  laid down by NASA in the 20 years between  1960 and 1980? The answer shouldn't sur prise anyone. Most of the innovative products  and services which we  take  for granted  in  1990 are  in some way beholden  to  the re search which was done 20 or 30 years ago  during the early days of our space effort.  The superconducting super collider  is es sential to the scientists of tomorrow and will  equip those scientists with the basic research  which will  provide  the United States  the  knowledge and the tools to continue our suc cess in so many fields well into the 21st cen tury. The dollars  this Nation,  the State of  Texas, and foreign contributors will  invest to  make the SSC a reality will help maintain our  leadership in high-energy physics and will lead  to advances  in communications, electronics,  computers, and countless other fields.  We have a responsibility to provide a firm  foundation  for the next generation of Ameri cans. The collider is an integral piece of that  foundation. More than that, we have a duty to  uphold our historical  tradition of leading the  way into the future through ambitious explora tion.  I am proud the collider will be built in Texas.  But the collider itself is more important than  where it will be built Individual scientists, uni versities, and  companies  from  around  the  country will participate  in building and using  the collider. This is truly a national project and  I am proud to support it.  Some have  raised questions about  this  project. A few Members have doubted Texas'  financial commitment.

149,,101,0.227,142,7,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, a political  sea change  in moving  throughout Eastern  Europe that is bringing democracy, and a less ening of tensions in that region.  In response  to these dramatic changes, NATO is trying to  redefine  its  role  in a new Europe  that will  surely be less threatening to Western interests  than  in previous years. Our European . allies  are planning  force  reductions and America  also envisions  troop and equipment cuts  in  Europe in response to the improving political  climate on that continent.  These dramatic changes have prompted me  to question why Turkey needs yet more mili tary equipment during this period of improving  relations between the former members of the  Warsaw Pact and NATO. I also ask this ques tion in light of Turkey's instransigence on the  Cyprus problem. Given these concerns, Con gressman YA TRON and I recently introduced a  resolution of disapproval concerning the pro posed sale of sophisticated attack helicopters  to Turkey. Given Turkey's poor track record in  using  U.S.-supplied military  hardware  on  Cyprus,  there  is concern that those helicop ters might be transferred to that island in clear  contravention of the will of the U.S. Congress.  Although we did not call for further committee  consideration of the resolution, both of us are  deeply concerned about Turkey's  failure  to  lend a hand in solving the Cyprus dispute.  It is my understanding that the administra tion may propose further sales and transfers  of modem equipment  to Turkey during  this  period  of  reduced  tensions. Should more  equipment transfers be envisoned by the ad-.  ministration, Congressman YATRON and  I will  vigorously oppose them and will call for com plete committee consideration and, possibly, a  House vote on these necessary and ill-timed  requests. Turkey must understand that there  are Members of Congress who question why  that nation should be  rewarded with more  U.S.-made military equipment while Ankara  drag$ its feet on the Cyprus issue.  The story of that small nation  is a tragic  one. For 16 years, 30,000 well-equipped Turk ish troops have illegally occupied the northern  side of the island. Ankara has consistently re fused to reduce its forces there. Many Greek  Cypriots were killed in the 197 4 invasion and  thousands are missing and remain unaccount ed for. Among the Americans who are missing  is Andrew Kassapis, a young Michigan resi dent who was taken  from his family's home  on  that  island and never seen again. Over  200,000 refugees fled to the south during the  invasion and  lost  their homes and posses sions. As if this were not enough, Turkey later  sent 60,000 settlers to northern Cyprus to live  in  the abandoned properties. Ancient Greek  Cypriot churches in northern Cyrus have been  looted and defaced and priceless mosaics  have been stolen and sold to art dealers in  Europe. Although Turkey had a major role in  creating the tragedy of Cyprus, it has played  only a minor part in the search for a solution.  Ankara claims  that  it wants a negotiated  settlement on Cyprus. But the Turkish Govern ment has done little to move the peace proc ess  forward. Not only have  the Turkish au thorities refused to reduce military force levels  on  the island,  they have used modem U.S. supplied military equipment on Cyprus. Origi nally intended for NATO defensive purposes,  use of this material in this manner is in viola tion of U.S.  law. Turkish  troops  remain on  Cyprus in clear defiance of the requests of the  United Nations, the European Community, and  the U.S. Congress.  Is there any wonder that  our allies call Turkey the only European nation  that is an occupying power and deny Turkey  membership in the European Community?  Turkey, the political and financial supporter  of  the Turkish-Cypriot  community  on  that  island,  is  the only country in  the world  that  recognizes the so-called Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus. Turkey has failed to exercise  sufficient influence on Mr. Rauf Denktash, the  leader of  the Turkish-Cypriot community on  Cyprus, to encourage him to seriously pursue  a peaceful solution to the problems that divide  the island.  Last summer, Mr. Denktash rejected a U.N. prepared draft outline which provided general  guidance  as  to  how  intercommunal  talks  should proceed. He also derailed the Secre tary General's most recent  talks on Cyprus  and has yet to agree to resume the negotia tions. U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar  deserves our admiration for his good offices  and  for his energetic  commitment  to  the  peace process for Cyprus. President Vassiliou  of Cyprus has also displayed remarkable sta temanship and  flexibility  in  trying  to resolve  the Cyprus problem peacefully and has indi cated  that he  remains  ready  to work  for  peace.  As an ally of the United States that has re ceived millions of dollars  in U.S. economic  and military assistance over the years, Turkey  must play a more positive role in  the peace  process.  It should begin by withdrawing  its  troops  from Cyprus and by encouraging Mr.  Denktash to return to the intercommunal talks  and seriously negotiate for peace. Until I see  a change of heart on the part of Turkey and  the  leader of  the Cypriot community,  I will  oppose a ""business as usual"" approach  to  our relations with Ankara.  In particular,  I and my colleagues will con tinue to maintain the 7:1 O ratio in the levels of  U.S. foreign military financing for Greece and  Turkey. That ratio will also be applied to levels  of excess U.S. defense articles made avail able to both countries. The ratio enables our  government to meet its military and security  commitments in that region while insisting that  progress be made  in  the peace process on  Cyprus. The concept of a ratio began in 1978  when Turkey sought and won a resumption of  U.S. military assistance to Ankara. In spite of  the promises and expectations at that time,  thousands  of  Turkish  troops  remain  on  Cyprus. My expectations about troop levels on  Cyprus have not yet been met and there is no  reason to abandon our insistence that Turkey  comply with the terms of the agreement.  With peace breaking out all over the world,  it is time for men of good will to focus their  energies and attention on Cyprus and settle  this oft-neglected dispute.  It  is certainly not  the time to further fatten Turkey's already for midable military arsenal.  OPPOSED TO MILITARY  EQUIPMENT TO TURKEY  HON.

150,,101,-0.174,142,7,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to call at tention to the Pentagon's proposal to sell five  AH-1 W attack helicopters to the Government  of Turkey.  I have joined my good friend and  colleague, the ranking minority member of the  House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congress man WILLIAM s. BROOMFIELD in opposing this  sale. Although the implementation of the sale  of  these defense articles  is  inevitable, Tur key's unjust occupation of over a third of the  sovereign state of Cyprus makes it necessary  that we  in Congress continue  to speak out  against the administration's efforts to strength en military ties with Ankara.  Mr. Speaker, we should be consistent  in  promoting a policy toward Cyprus based on  the same principles we have supported for the  rest of the world-human rights,  representa tive government, and nonaggression. Unfortu nately, this has not been the case.  The dispute on Cyprus is not one which fits  into the traditional East-West regional conflict  which we are now seeing resolved. Executive  branch officials have  tended  to view Cyprus  as a symptom of a larger problem between  Greece and Turkey. The notion of the U.S.  pressing for a settlement to a dispute which  may antagonize one of our friends has never  been well-received at the State Department or  the Pentagon. Even when it is clear that one  country-Turkey-is the aggressor, the policy  of  benign  neglect  remains  the  preferred  option.  Mr. Speaker, I hope that by calling attention  to this helicopter sale, Ankara will be remind ed that its occupation of Cyprus will continue  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

153,House,101,-0.004,181,7,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker, I am  honored to be the primary sponsor of  H.R. 3802, which calls upon the Con gress and the President to set aside  the month of May 1990,  as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.  I  am  indebted  to my  colleague,  NORMAN Y. MINETA of California, for  joining me in this effort. He has been  supportive of this legislation from its  outset and was an original cosponsor  of  the first  resolution  for Heritage  Week. As one of his last legislative ac tions, my good friend, the late Senator  Spark Matsunaga, introduced the com panion bill, S. 2111, in the U.S. Senate.  With  252  cosponsors, H.R.  3802  would amend Public Law 95-419 and  expand  the Asian-Pacific American  Heritage observance period  from  a  week to a full month.  On June 30, 1977, I had the unique  honor  and  pleasure of  introducing  House Joint Resolution 540 and later  House Joint Resolution 1007, which,  for the first time in this Nation's his tory,  asked  the Congress  and  the  people of  the United States  to set  aside a period in May as Asian-Pacific  American Heritage Week. More than  13 years ago a woman came to my  office and told my administrative as sistant, Ruby Moy, and me a very com pelling and persuasive story. Today, I  share the origin of this landmark leg islation.  The  celebration  of Asian-Pacific  American Heritage Month has a very  deep and personal place  for Jeanie  Jew and her family. Their story began  sometime in the 1800's when a young  man, M.Y. Lee, left Toishan, Canton,  China, to find a better life in America.  Mr. Lee was one of the first Chinese  pioneers to help build the Transconti nental Railroad. He  later became a  prominent  California  businessman.  When the Chinese were having diffi culties in Oregon, Mr. Lee traveled to  Oregon and was killed during  that  period of unrest. It was a time of anti Chinese and anti-Asian sentiment.The  revelations about Mr. Lee  and  the  story of Asian Americans led this one  woman to believe that not only should  Asians understand their own heritage,  but  that all Americans must know  about the contributions and histories  of the Asian-Pacific American experi ence in the United States. Jeanie Jew,  the creator of the idea for a heritage  month, is the granddaughter of M.Y.  Lee, that early pioneer.  The original  resolution designated  the week beginning May 4 as Asian Pacific American Heritage Week be cause that week included two signifi cant occasions in the proud history of  Asian Americans. May 10,  1869, or  ""Golden Spike Day,"" was the day on  which the Transcontinental Railroad  was  completed,  largely by Chinese  American pioneers. May 7, 1843, marks  the date of the first arrival of the Jap anese in the United States. Both dates  will fittingly be included in Asian-Pa cific American Heritage Month.  I want to commend the two women  who made  this event possible. Mrs.  Jew turned a personal tragedy in her  family history into a positive force.  Asian-Pacific  American  Heritage  Month will now be observed by all  Americans. I also want to thank Ruby  Moy, my administrative assistant, for  her efforts to pass this legislation. She  holds the highest professional position  to a Member of Congress. She  is a  second generation Asian American.  In 1977, Mrs. Jew and Ms. Moy co founded the Congressional Asian Pa cific Staff Caucus,  an organization  which collectively worked for the es tablishment of the first heritage proc lamation and supports yearly efforts  to  perpetuate  its  recognition. The  caucus, a group of professional staff  members of Asian descent, periodically  discusses and reviews  legislation and  issues  of  concern  to Asian-Pacific  Americans.  Sometime ago, Jeanie Jew discussed  the idea of issuing a series of com memorative stamps with several Mem bers of Congress including me. In light  of this years historical change  to a  month-long observance, it is fitting to  again request the U.S. Postal Service  issue a series of postage stamps com memorating our Nation's Asian-Pacific  American  heritage.  These  stamps  could depict Heritage Month, individ uals, subjects, or places that are signif icant in Asian-Pacific American histo ry in the United States. As a senior  member of the House Post Office and  Civil Service Committee,  I urge the  Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee  to consider issuing a stamp at the ear liest possible date.  I hope my coLeagues will join me in  supporting these stamps and in recog nizing the history and contributions of  Asian-Pacific Americans, particularly  during Asian-Pacific American Herit age Month.

154,House,101,-0.479,181,7,Mr. MINETA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 3802,  legisla tion which designates May as ""Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.""  I would like to thank Mr. SAWYER,  chair of the Subcommittee on Census  and Population and Mr. RIDGE  for  their effective leadership in bringing  this bill to the House floor today. I  would like to express my appreciation  to the gentleman from New York CMr.  HORTON]  for his  tireless efforts on  behalf of this legislation.  Our great friend and distinguished  colleague, the late Senator Spark Mat sunaga, authored  this  legislation  in  the other body. This bill is a tribute to  Spark's memory and  to his achieve ments as a  statesman, an educator,  and a patriot.  During the last decade,  there has  been increasing visibility of the accom plishments of Asian-Pacific Americans  which  have  benefited  this  great  Nation. The designation of this month  is a formal recognition of the impor tant role that the Asian-Pacific Ameri can experience plays in our country's  history and future.  ",1990
155,Senate,101,-0.123,246,7,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr.  President,  I  would like to commend my colleagues  for their work on this complex and im portant issue. The distinguished Sena tors from Arkansas, Senators PRYOR  and BUMPERS, and my senior colleague  from Louisiana, Senator  JOHNSTON,  have been very active and diligent in  addressing  the  uncertain  situation  faced by our Nation's farmers. Like wise, the chairman of the Committee  on Environment and Public Works,  Senator  BURDICK,  and  our  distin guished  ranking member,  Senator  CHAFEE,  have been most helpful  in  joining with us to clarify the operation  of  the section 404 program of  the  Clean Water Act and its effect on agri cultural operations.  In recent days we have worked with  the Corps of Engineers, the Environ mental Protection Agency, the Depart ment of Agriculture, and the White  House in a cooperative effort to see to  it that farmers receive equitable treat ment  under  the  404  program,  to  ensure  that  the  regulatory agencies  share a common understanding of the  application of the program to agricul tural activities, and to improve the ef forts of the Federal Government to  communicate  effectively  with  our  farmers on the kinds of activities that  are, and are not, within the scope of  the program.  Mr. President, the documents that  we are including in the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD today will, I hope, significant ly clarify for both the farm communi ty and the regulators at the field level  the scope and extent of the section 404  program and its application to normal  farming activities. The corps and EPA  have committed to work actively with  the  Department  of  Agriculture  through  its Cooperative Extension  Service to help those involved in agri culture to better understand the 404  program and  to see  to  it  that our  farmers do not inadvertently violate  the law. Congress has provided specific  exemptions from the 404 program for  normal farming, ranching, and silvicul tural  activities. With  the  recent  changes  in  the wetland delineation  methodology, it is particularly impor tant that our farmers, many of whom  have never previously been affected by  the  complex  regulatory  program  under section 404, be well  informed  and be assured that continuing their  normal farming practices will not re quire new burdens or subject them to  potential violations of Federal law. I  commend these documents to the at tention of all of my colleagues.  ",1990
156,Senate,101,-0.426,259,7,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President,  last  week, the administration made a seri ous mistake when it failed to identify  trade  in auto parts and accessories  with Japan as a  trade  liberalization  priority under the Super 301 provision  of the 1988 Trade Act. Indeed, by fail ing to name any new trade liberaliza tion  priorities,  the  administration  strayed  in no uncertain  terms from  the intent of Congress. The confer ence report to the Omnibus Trade and  Competitiveness Act of 1988 clearly  stated that the changes made to Super  301 in conference were ""not intended  to result in the identification of only  token practices and countries.""  The administration's decision sends  the wrong signal to Japan at a key  moment for both the auto parts and  semiconductor industries. Ambassador  Hills Justified her decision on auto  parts in part by arguing that negotia tions are in process on this topic in the  structural  impediments  initiative  talks. Mr. President, auto parts negoti ations with  Japan  have  been  in  progress in one form or another since  1986. After nearly 4 years, American  companies continue to wait for signifi cant results. Without further action  by  their Government,  I  am afraid  their wait will be in vain.  The structural  impediments  initia tive, however well  intentioned,  is at  root little more than another in a long  series of promises of future progress  by  the  Japanese Government. The  structural impediments initiative talks  provide  no mechanism  to measure  whether general  promises  translate  into changes in behavior and increases  in American sales. The auto parts in dustry has already  lived  through 4  years of promises. It is unacceptable to  ask it, as the administration in effect  has, to live through another 4 years of  empty promises.  The industry does not have 4 more  years  to wait;  it  is already on  the  threshold of a serious crisis. Produc tion by  foreign  auto  companies  in  North America rose from zero in 1980  to over a million cars in 1988. It is ex pected  to double again-to approxi mately 2.5 million cars-by the end of  this year. At the same time, GM, Ford,  and Chrysler have been slashing pro ductive capacity. As a  result,  in the  space of less than a decade, foreign  auto manufacturers have taken over  more than one-fourth of all auto pro duction in North America.  This change in the auto industry in  the 1980's has powerful implications  for the parts industry in the 1990's. A  1989 study by the General Accounting  Office for Chairman BENTSEN  found  that Japanese car companies  in the  United States rely on their family of  affiliated suppliers for over 60 percent  of their components. By contrast, the  Big Three source nearly 90 percent of  their  components  from  traditional  American companies. Since the trans plant assembly operations coming on  line are by and  large replacing Big  Three production, the traditional auto  parts industry stands to lose as much  as in the next 2 or 3 years as the Big  Three have lost in the past five.  It would be one thing if American  firms were destined to lose this busi ness  on  competitive  grounds. But  there is evidence that the same unfair  trade  practices  that  have  blocked  United States exports to the Japanese  market are now blocking United States  sales to foreign subsidiaries in our own  market. In addition,  there is signifi cant  evidence  that  Japanese  parts  firms  are  underpricing  traditional  American firms in the United States  market, despite an adverse foreign ex change rate, because they earn higher  profits from a captive home market  that is maintained by blocking foreign  access. This is an all too familiar pat tern of Japanese industrial success. Fi nally, for cyclical reasons, auto sales  are expected to be weak in the near  term, and a  recession would compli cate matters even further.  Accordingly, as the foreign share of  auto  assembly  in North America  grows, the threat to traditional Ameri can upstream industries, like the parts  industry, will grow unless steps are  taken to ensure that: First, the trans plants make procurement decisions in  the United States on the basis of the  same competitive principles as the Big  Three;  and  second,  Japanese parts  companies lose the artificial advantage  of a closed home market.  Mr. President, we cannot allow the  anticompetitive  practices  that  are  common  in Japan  to  take  root  in  American soil. The best time to influ ence this matter is now, as the trans plant assembly operations are coming  online and still forming their supply  relationships. We must exert the nec essary pressure before the die is cast.  The stakes are too high-in terms of  Jobs and our technological and indus trial base-to take a wait-and-see atti tude for another few years.  For this reason, I am pleased to in troduce with bipartisan and industry  support a bill sending the clear mes sage that the U.S. Government will  not be content merely to conclude an other round of negotiations. It expects  early, meaningful results and will take  concrete steps to measure such results,  or the lack  thereof,  in  the market place.  The bill requires semiannual reports  containing data detailing the extent of  increases in auto parts sales by tradi tonal United States firms to Japanese  assemblers in both the United States  and Japanese markets. The  lack of  data  in this form has hindered the  market oriented sector specific negoti ations process since  its  inception in  1986. Without it, progress cannot be  measured  accurately. And without  meaningful public accountability, Jap anese companies are under less pres sure to mend their ways.  The bill creates Department of Com merce and International Trade Com mission reports to produce data on tra ditional United States company ex ports to the Japanese market and sales  to foreign  transplants  in the North  American market,  respectively. The  Commerce Department report is not a  new report; it is a refinement of the  existing reporting requirement of the  auto parts provision of the 1988 Trade  Act, the so-called Quayle amendment.  In addition to these two reports, the  bill requests a study from the Depart ment of Justice to determine whether  there is sufficient validity to reports of  anticompetitive  practices  by  trans plants in the U.S. market to warrant a  more formal antitrust investigation.  Finally, the bill calls for a section  301 investigation with respect to auto  parts trade with Japan.  Again, Mr. President,  the adminis tration made a  serious mistake  last  week  in  failing  to maintain strong  pressure on Japan in the critically im portant area of auto parts trade. Con gress should respond by taking these  actions  in view  of  the  long  track  record of minimal progress on United  States-Japan auto parts  trade,  the  large share of our bilateral trade defi cit attributable  to auto parts-over  one-fifth-the lack of available means  in the structural impediments initia tive to measure results, and the fact  that the industry is at a critical Junc ture due  to  the continuing replace ment of Big Three plants by trans plant operations and a possible reces sion.  Indeed,  this  is  a  pivotal moment  both for the U.S. auto parts industry  and for U.S.  trade policy. Mr. Presi dent, this bill is no substitute for the  need to extend and strengthen Super  301, which I will continue to work on  with my colleagues. Rather, the bill is  an effort  to  take more  immediate,  practical steps to prevent a crisis in an  ",1990

Even  with her confidence, she  remained  in awe  over the big city and indeed, the wonders of  the world.  As an intern in the office of her Congress man, Julie began to explore the Nation's Cap ital and all that makes our Government work.  Her  first professional  responsibility was  to  serve as receptionist to California Congress man  RICHARD  LEHMAN.  She  eventually  became executive manager for ""Rick's Kids""  as she carried out program coordination for an  endless string of congressional interns.  Highlighting Julie's stay in Washington was  her selection as California's Cherry Blossom  Princess and participating  in  the pomp and  pageantry of the 1982 Cherry Blossom Festi val. Julie also celebrated her 21st birthday  during  her Washington  tour  and  Arthur  became a part of her life. None of us will ever  forget him coming down with ""Parvo,"" or that  frantic car ride to the veterinary hospital, and  finally a call from Dr. Connell saying ""We've  saved Arthur.""  In a very special way,  that  week  reflects  the blossoming of a young  woman, a growing sense of life's possibilities,  and a new level of caring.  Julie came to realize that while there was  so much to see and do  in this world,  there  was also much to learn.

159,Senate,101,0.322,350,7,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, yesterday,  my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle unveiled their campaign finance  reform plan. I congratulate them on  their efforts.  Although the plan's legislative lan guage  is not yet available-and al though I have not seen a  list of co sponsors-I know  that virtually  full  public financing of Senate campaigns  is one of the plan's key elements. I  also understand  that  the Democrat  bill does absolutely nothing to curb  labor union soft-money abuses.  PUBLIC FINANCING  Last Tuesday,  the Senate Republi cans unveiled their own campaign fi nance reform initiative. The initiative  now has 34 cosponsors, and I expect  additional cosponsors to come onboard  next week.  I am pleased  that the Republican  bill rejects public financing outright.  No excuses. No burdens on the Ameri can taxpayer. And no taxpayer financ ing of politicians.  If history  teaches us anything,  it  teaches us that public financing is bad  public policy, and it is very, very ex pensive.

160,Senate,101,-0.216,363,7,Mr. DECONCINI.,"  I ask unanimous  consent that the statement of Prime  Minister Prunskiene, as presented to  the Helsinki Commission on May 3,  1990, here in the U.S. Senate be print ed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the state ment was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  REMARKS OF THE PRIME MINISTER OF LITHUA NIA, KAZIMIERA Pl\UNSKIENE TO THE HEL SINKI COMMISSION, THURSDAY, MAY 3, 1990  For some  time now, Lithuania and her  Baltic neighbors have been reminding the  world of the fact of their existence and, by  doing so, have aroused worry as well as in terest.  The Lithuanian question did not arise be cause it was arbitrarily willed by someone or  in order to frustrate someone else's will and  desires. The restoration of an independent  Lithuanian state was a legal act, expressing  the nation's self-determination and its right  to full sovereignty. By international agree ment, this is a political right of all nations.  The most important preconditions for the  restoration of independence were:  1. The Lithuanian nation's long-standing  desire, shared by the other two Baltic na tions, for independent statehood, which was  given expression by its democratically elect ed parliament.  2. The refusal of other states around the  world to recognize the annexation of Lith uania by the Soviet Union.  3. Political changes under Mr. Gorbachev  which permitted the Soviet Union itself to  declare the Hitler-Stalin pact null and void.  The act entitled ""On the Restoration of  an  Independent Lithuanian State"" which  was passed by the Lithuanian parliament on  March 11 begins to establish our state sover eignty. We have enacted a legal, de jure sov ereignty which will require much effort and  a certain amount of time in order to be real ized de facto.  By no means does the Lithuanian parlia ment and government believe that de facto  independence can be grabbed unilaterally  and quickly, especially when dealing with  the Soviet Union with its deep-rooted impe rial traditions.  Lithuania does not want to burden Mr.  Gorbachev with her problems, complicating  his situation and raising a danger to his  leadership or to perestroika, a danger that  has been dramatized  around  the world.  Lithuania also does not want to shift her  problems onto the West. Nevertheless, these  three sides-the Soviet Union, Lithuania  and the West-are drawn together through  the Lithuanian issue. How the question is  solved will depend first of all on the people  of Lithuania themselves, on their unity, de termination, calm and so long as the eco nomic blockage lasts, on their stamina and  enterprise as well. The people are showing  the world tht they do have those qualities.  The roles of East and West in the resolu tion of the Lithuanian question are compli cated by a series of factors:  1. The Soviet Union does not have a bal anced equilibrium of political  forces. Al though  the  influence of  the democratic  forces is increasing, it is not yet equal to the  other side. The democratic forces are only  starting  to  consolidate  and  often  clash  among themselves. From what I have ob served, Mr. Gorbachev does not make full  use of support from the democratic forces  to overcome the reactionaries.  2. The western nations, thanks to whose  non-recognition policy Lithuania was able to  preserve  the legal continuity of her inde pendence, became accustomed to her factual  dependence. They valued Mr. Gorbachev's  perestroika as a way of ensuring human and  national rights to the point that the process  began to be valued more than the goal-the  realization of these rights.  It is difficult for the West to perceive that  pressuring the Soviet Union on the Lithua nian question helps rather than hinders Mr.  Gorbachev to be a consistent practitioner of  democracy more than that, to overcome the  reactionary forces which oppose not only in dependence for the Baltic states but also po litical and economic reforms in general. The  West's position now, during a period of eco nomic difficulties for the Soviet Union, can  be one of the most important arguments for  a decisive  turn to reform. This argument  would have been  ineffective several years  ago, for it is only now that the people dare  to contradict the government and raise de mands.  Lithuania  is undergoing a great testing,  but so too is the Soviet Union as well as the  West. What sort of Russia or Soviet Union  will emerge depends  in part on how  the  Lithuanian issue will be resolved. This is un",1990
161,Senate,101,0.589,415,7,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President, I  would like to voice my strong support  for. the pending amendment to section  3<e> of the impact aid statute.  We are all familiar with section 3 of  Public Law 81-874, which provides fi nancial assistance for local education  agencies in areas where Federal activi ties increase the number of children a  district must educate. Section 3 pay ments are allocated based on enroll ment of  two  types of students: stu dents whose parents live and work on  Federal property <category A>.  and  students whose parents live or work on  Federal property <category B>.  However, section 3<e>, which author izes phase-out entitlements to school  districts losing a substantial number of  Federally connected children due to a  reduced Federal  presence,  is  often  overlooked. Specifically,  section 3Ce>  provides eligible school districts with a  3-year phase-down of hold harmless  payments to minimize the trauma of  large scale Federal reductions. These  payments are calculated at 90 percent  of the prior year's category 3<A> and  3CB> entitlement.  The fact that section 3<e>  is often  overlooked  is  somewhat understand able  considering  that more  than a  decade has elapsed since it was last ap plied.

WILLIAM D. FORD.  Since November 3, 1964, Mr. FoRD  has been a diligent Representative of  his home State of Michigan. Among  other accomplishments, his service on  the Post Office and Civil Service Com mittee is worthy of merit and procla mation of praise before his peers. Mr.  FORD has served as chairman of the  Committee on Post Office and Civil  Service since 1980, and during  that  time he has vigorously promoted the  U.S. Postal Service and civilian agen cies and has adamantly demanded im proved pay and benefits for those em ployed by our Postal Service and other  Government agencies. He has led his  committee to the forefront of public  service and,  in so doing, has earned  the respect and admiration of those  with whom he has worked. The offi cial unveiling of Mr. FoRD's portrait on  March 21, 1990 was a timely occasion  to honor a man who has done so much  for his Government and his  fellow  man.  In recognition of these auspicious ac complishments, I urge my colleagues  to support House Concurrent Resolu tion 272.

As part of the celebration of Small Business  Week, I wish to congratulate a small business man  from my district, Mr. Arthur Brady of  Arthur Brady Associates, Inc. in Party Amboy,  NJ. Mr. Brady has been named the ""Regional  Small Business Subcontractor of the Year for  for  this  Region  II,"" having been nominated  award by a client, Hughes Aircraft.  A decade ago, Arthur Brady established a  commercial materials  testing  laboratory with  one employee. His company, Arthur Brady As sociates, has grown since 1980  into a firm  with 1 O employees who operate not only the  testing lab but also a manufacturing division to  make solder for electrical equipment, specifi cally for printed circuit boards.  ""A dynamic team of creative problem solv ers"" is how Mr. Brady describes his employ ees, but is clear that such creativity and dyna mism flows from the company's founder. Mr.  Brady, who previously worked  for AT&T and  General Motors as a chemist, is originally from  Jamaica, and has become an American citi zen. He has worked hard to publicize his com pany's products and has built a client base  which includes such customers as ITT, Allied  Signal, DuPont, and  IBM. His success stems  from quality service, fair pricing, and consist ency in the delivery of a good product. These  attributes have enabled  the Department of  Defense to qualify his company for the Quali fied Products List, a designation within DOD  of high-quality products.  He has contributed  to his community not  only by the product he provides but through  the jobs he has provided  in both Middlesex  and Union County, NJ.  I am proud  to con gratulate Mr. Brady and his employees on  their efforts and wish them continued success  in the future.  ",1990

As a small businessman  myself, let me say I am especially honored to  have this opportunity to recognize the industri ous spirit of my small business peers.  As American's, we have all benefited from  the  innovation and  industry of our entrepre neurs. It is only appropriate that we set aside  this week to celebrate their accomplishments  and  recognize  the attributes of  their enter prise. The success of American small busi ness is at the heart of our Nation's unprece dented history of peace and prosperity. Our  acclaimed traditions of ingenuity and produc tivity are embodied by the daily efforts of our  small business people, and are envied by  people the world over.  As  the walls of  isolation and oppression  crumble throughout the globe, it is appropriate  that this year's theme suggests the continu ation of American business leadership into the  21st century. Today, opportunity for innovation  and  industry  is  tantamount. New challenges  associated with  the emerging democracies  and  the need  for environmental  technology  beckon for American ingenuity. As legislators,  we must encourage small business participa tion, and enlist their expertise as we assist in  the transition of Eastern Europe to democrat ic, free enterprise states.  I  thank my colleague, Congressman  IRE LAND, for taking the initiative to recognize the  small  business  community.  I  for one,  am  pleased to add my support for Small Business  Week, and  I hope that my colleagues in the  House will add their support as well.  GENERAL LEAVE  ",1990

FA Sebring Elementary began their MilJion  M'lllUtes Reacing Program at the begjnning of  the 1989-90 school year. The goal of the pro gram was to get the 40 students of Sebring  Elementary  read  for  1 million minutes  during  the school year.  If a student reads  more than 100 minutes in a month their name  would be put in a drawing for the book of the  month. Area businesses and the local parent  ~tion donated the book and also a bicy cle which was given as a grand prize.  The students kept track of the minutes read  by placing  stickers  in  the hallway of  the  school. This enabled  the students  to keep  track of their total minutes read as well as vis ualize what a million really looks like.

Mrs. Robinson was  a  true  leader of our community and her presence will  be sorely missed. She was an inspiration to all  who knew her.  Raised in Yonkers, NY, she began her ex traordinary  lifetime  of  service when  she  became active in voter registration campaigns  as a teenager. She developed a strong sense  of moral, social, and political awareness as a  young person  that was  to guide her  in her  quest for justice and equal rights for all Ameri cans.  She was a  founding member of  the  first  black democratic club in Yonkers as well as  the Nepperhan Community Center which she  began in her home.  In  the early 1950's, she was a volunteer  chaperon for the Yonkers Service Club, where  she escorted  young  people  to U.S.  army  bases and West Point to entertain military per sonnel. She was also a  foster mother  for  unwed mothers, sharing her home with young  women in desperate need of a helping hand.  In the early 1960's, May Robinson was ar rested  for taking part in a demonstration at  Yonkers City Hall where a sit-in was being  staged to aid 40 families left homeless by fire.  In 1963, she organized a caravan of 10 buses  for the Civil Rights March on Washington. She  was also elected as the first Black delegate  from what was then  the 25th Congressional  District to a National Democratic Convention.  In 197 4,  the National Urban League ap pointed her to head its voter registration pro gram  in Yonkers. Mrs. Robinson continued  until her death  to campaign  for candidates  who are proponents of peace, women's rights,  nuclear freeze, and equality and justice for all.  Mr. Speaker, May Robinson made outstand ing contributions  through her  involvement  in  organizations  that make  our  community a  better place to live. Mrs. Robinson was an ex traordinary American, and she will be greatly  missed. Her service to our Nation has left an  imprint-a better world for future generations.

172,,101,-0.429,597,7,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to pay tribute to the Kew Gardens Synagogue  Adath Yeshurun, which will mark its golden ju bilee with a dinner dance on May 13 at the  Beth Sholom Synagogue in Lawrence, NY.  The Kew Gardens Synagogue is one of the  oldest Jewish congregations  in  the central  Queens area of New York City. Those who  established  the synagogue came  from many  different ethnic backgrounds, including many  who escaped  the Holocaust  in Europe and  were able  to come  together  to establish a  congregation that has been a place of prayer  and charity for the past 50 years. In that time  the synagogue has witnessed its congregation  grow  from a modest 14 congregants  to  its  now thriving community of 380 active mem bers.  The Kew Gardens Synagogue throughout its  50-year history has been more than a house  of worship. Founded by the late David Levine,  it has fulfilled the need for community services  for Jews and gentiles alike. The services the  synagogue provides to the community include  a nursery school, youth activities such as little  league baseball and sports programs  for all  children, sabbath youth groups, educational  and cultural programs for men and women, in cluding  study groups and  cultural  lectures  given by reputed individuals from outside the  synagogue. The synagogue has also devel oped  special  programs  to  support  single  parent families, and assist recent  immigrants  from the Soviet Union in adapting to life in the  United States.  The many programs and activities were ex pended through the years under the steward ship of many dedicated men and women.  I  would especially like to honor: board of trust ee members David Weil, Richard Koppel and  Amon Hiller; Vice-Presidents Gregory Bin kiewicz and Hymen Arbesfeld; Treasurer Eli  Mirzoeff; Financial Secretary Noah Diamond;  Correspondence Secretary Simon Mietles; and  Recording Secretary Nathan Rahimi  for their  timeless dedication over the years to the Syn agogue and the Kew Gardens community. At  present,  the synagogue  is  led by President  Fred Friedman  in partnership with Rabbi Dr.  Barnard Rosenweig, the spiritual leader of the  Kew Gardens Synagogue. These men, with  the help of the other members of the syna gogue, have worked diligently to adapt to the  ever changing needs of  the Kew Gardens  community.  The Kew Gardens Synagogue has survived  many trials and tribulations during its first half  century, but it has survived and prospered as  a place the community turns to in times of joy  and need. I would like to ask my colleagues to  join me in congratulating Kew Gardens Syna gogue Adath Yeshurun on its 50th anniversary  and to extend the hope that the next 50 years  will be as successful as its first.  9727  FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF  CHERNOBYL  HON. STENY H. HOYER  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 8, 1990  ",1990
173,,101,-0.379,597,7,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, with each pass ing anniversary of the April 26, 1986, Cherno byl nuclear disaster, we learn more and more  about the devastating toll on  the surrounding  population and environment. Within  the  last  few months, information about the full extent  of  this  tragedy, previously concealed by  the  Soviet Government, is slowly coming to light.  The devastating consequences .of Cherno byl, Mr. Speaker, are found everywhere. The  consequences are  found  in  the poisoning of  the  surrounding  environment,  with  many  places unfit  for human habitat;  farm animals  born  deformed;  deadly  crops,  berries  and  mushrooms. They are found in the astounding  economic consequences which, according  to  estimates by Soviet economists, amount  to  over $300 billion.  But much more  importantly,  the  conse quences are  found  in  the devastating effect  on human beings. They are  found  in  lives  lost-some 300, according  to Yuriy Shcher bak, a deputy chairman of the U.S.S.R. Su preme Soviet's Environmental Subcommittee.  They are  found  in  the deterioration of  the  health of thousands upon  thousands among  the surrounding population  in Ukraine, Byelo russia and  the Russian republic, as  the  inci dences of leukemia, thyroid cancer and other  radiation-related  illnesses among the popula tion have grown dramatically and continues to  grow. The consequences are also  found on  the faces of these surrounding populations faces which display fear, uncertainty, and anx iety about the future. Indeed the psychological  effects of Chernobyl-both on  those who  were  uprooted  and  evacuated  from  their  homes and  on  the many  thousands who  stayed unknowingly when  they should have  been evacuated-may be as traumatic as the  physical effects. And, Mr. Speaker, the conse quences are found in a crisis of trust in official  Soviet bodies  that confused or hid  the  full  tragedy of Chernobyl.  At long last, Soviet officials are beginning to  recognize  the profound crisis of  trust  that  Chernobyl engendered and are beginning  to  address its effects. The Ukrainian ministry of  health, with its new head, Yuriy Spizhenko, is  increasingly  revealing  Chernobyl's medical  consequences. And on April 22, the U.S.S.R.  Council of Ministers accepted a new 16-bil lion-ruble plan  to assist Chernobyl's victims  over the next 3 years.  That the truth is emerging about Chernobyl  and some action is being taken is due to per sistent pressure by independent groups such  as green world and  the popular movement  Rukh  in  Ukraine which  fought  to  break  through the Soviet Government's ""conspiracy  of silence."" In the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, 80  miles  from Chernobyl, 70,000 people  turned  out for a commemorative meeting on the April  26 anniversary sponsored by Rukh. Leaders  of the demonstration called  for a drastic re duction of  the nuclear energy  industry and  ",1990
174,Senate,101,-0.297,649,7,Mr. SANFORD.," Mr. President, I rise  today in recognition of the outstand ing  achievements  and  contributions  the small businesses of America have  brought to our society. The zealous  and  innovative spirit which  led out  pioneers across this uncharted conti nent leads our small business owners  today in a business climate that offers  new challenges and practices in this  new global marketplace.  The theme for this week is ""Small  Business: Leading America  Into  the  21st Century"", I believe it is appropri ately named as  the small businesses  are demonstrating their creative and  inventive talents in adapting to global  markets and new product designs. In  the wake of the political changes in  Eastern Europe  are  new  economic  freedoms. The changing Eastern Euro pean  countries  are  turning  to  the  small  business  community  in  the  United States to study how the free  enterprise system works  in a demo cratic society.  I am very proud of the accomplish ments of small business in the United  States. With over 20 million  small  businesses  in America  today,  small  businesses employ 6 out of every 10  working people. Small businesses also  ""account for the majority of new jobs  and are more immediately responsive  to changing demographics, economic  patterns, and shifting markets than  larger firms.''  The pioneers and the entrepreneurs  of small business should be commend ed this week, and should be remem bered as we draft and pass legislation  which affects the business community.  In speaking with business leaders in  North Carolina I have come to under stand  how  our  spending  priorities  affect our small businesses.  I  have  heard complaints from small business  owners that there  is a  lack of ade quately skilled and literate workers. I  have heard  complaints  from  small  business owners that there is insuffi cient roadway systems for consumer  and manufacturer accessibility. I have  also heard complaints from business  leaders about the increasing costs of  capital.  I would hope that we  in Congress  adopt the spirit of the small business  person and strive to be creative and in novative in providing funding for our  human  resource and education pro grams to ensure that our public is lit erate and employable. And I also hope  we possess the courage of the pioneers  as we work to deal with the increasing  Federal deficit and growing budget  problems.  Lastly, Mr. President, I would like to  congratulate  every  small  business  person in America, and express my ap preciation to them for their determi nation and their many achievements. I  especially would  like  to extend my  congratulations to Mr. Tony A. Pope,  president of Catawba Transportation  Group,  Inc., of Claremont, NC,  the  State  small  business winner  from  North Carolina. Mr. Pope, through his  family business, exhibits the dedica tion and drive that is so characteristic  of small business leaders. I hope that  we continue  to  recognize  the many  benefits  brought  to  our  society  through the small businesses of Amer ica, and try our best in Congress to  emulate their courage and conviction  to purpose.

175,Senate,101,-0.326,662,7,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  I am proud to join Senator KENNEDY,  Senator DODD and other colleagues in  supporting the Homelessness Preven tion  and Community Revitalization  Act of 1990. This bill is a compassion ate measure designed to extend sup port and assistance to families and in dividuals who are hovering on  the  brink and at grave risk of becoming  homeless.  Homelessness is a national tragedy.  No State, no community is  immune .  Repeatedly, we  see  in  the national  news the tragic picture of families and  individuals living on the streets of New  York and Washington. We read about  families struggling to raise children in  temporary  shelters. The Affordable  Housing Institute estimates that be tween 4 to 14 million families live ""on  the knife edge of homelessness."" Un fortunately, West Virginia has its own  stories of homeless people. We also  have too many families struggling in  substandard housing, on the brink of  homelessness.  Americans recognize the tradegy of  homelessness. National surveys show  that people want  to do  something  about  this problem. For example, a  recent Washington Post-ABC News  poll indicated that 2 out of 3 Ameri cans believe homelessness is a major  national problem, and 7 out of 10 said  that they would even pay more taxes  to build shelters for the homeless in  their areas.  ':'his legislation is an important step  toward combating homelessness. It fol lows the old saying, an ounce of pre vention is worth a pound of cure. The  bill seeks to prevent homelessness by  offering  support  and  assistance  to  those most vulnerable-families living  in public housing, individuals suffering  from chronic or debilitating  illness,  and others in need.  This measure  seeks  to  establish  family support centers in or near low income housing. The centers would  provide a wide variety of services to in dividuals and families to prevent vul nerable people from slipping into ho melessness. The centers would offer  health and nutritional services, drug  and alcohol counseling, family crisis  and  domestic  violence  counseling,  child development programs, job train ing, education and parenting classes.  These are basic needs that should be  met.  The bill also includes home health  services targeted to low-income hous ing and neighborhoods to provide sup port services necessary to give people  the option of living at home rather  than entering a nursing home or insti tutional care facility.  I am a strong  proponent of home health care. With  some help-a visiting nurse, periodic  visits by a homemaker, or respite care  relief for the primary caregiver-many  Americans would be able  to stay in  their own homes rather than enter a  nursing home or some type of institu tional care. People want  to stay  in  their own homes. It is more comfort ing. It is more compassionate. It is an  important health  care  option  that  should be expanded.  This bill  is an  important, positive  step toward preventing homelessness.  I am pleased to support this measure  which is aimed at helping low-income  families and individuals stay off the  streets, and I believe it is a wise invest. ment.  I  also  recognize  that our Nation  must invest in more affordable hous ing to meet the needs of families, sen iors and others struggling to keep a  roof over their heads. There is much  to be done  to prevent homelessness  and  revitalize our communities and  neighborhoods.  The  Homelessness  Prevention and Community Revital ization Act is a solid step forward.

176,Senate,101,-0.351,662,7,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, today I  join my distinguished colleagues, Sen ator KENNEDY, chairman of Labor and  Human Resources Committee,  and  Senator DODD, chairman of the Sub committee on Children, Family, Drugs  and Alcoholism, in introducing the Ho melessness Prevention and Communi ty Revitalization Act of 1990. This im portant  legislation will off er much  needed  assistance  to  the  growing  number of Americans who are home less.  Mr. President, the problem of home lessness  is growing  in my State of  Iowa. A study by researchers at Drake  University for the State of Iowa which  was released this past December, iden tified a much  larger homeless and  near  homeless  population  in  Iowa  than in previous studies. The study  found that 15, 713  Iowans are home less. And what  is  the largest group  within the homeless population? Trag ically, it's children. 8,405, or well over  half of all homeless Iowans are chil dren. This study also found that the  number of people who are near home less-those who would be homeless  without entitlements such as fuel or  rent  assistance-has  reached  over  68,000. Of these near homeless, over  25,000 are children.  Homelessness  is  a very  complex  problem with many interwined causes.  Another recent study  indicates  that  homelessness  in my State is  largely  rooted in economics. A 1986 report by  ",1990
177,House,101,0.496,701,7,Mr. ARCHER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker. House debate on day  care has now continued for more than  2 years. We have argued about day  care quality and  regulations,  about  new bureaucracy. about supply short ages,  about  committee  jurisdiction,  and about money.  Even though the House passed a bill,  significant differences of opinion exist  within  this body  regarding most of  those issues.  But I think the House did settle one  issue emphatically. It does not support  the ABC provisions of the Senate bill.  My motion  simply  instructs  the  House conferees on  that particular  issue  to  support  the existing clear  House  position  by  rejecting  those  Senate provisions. It underscores the  existing  clear House  position. No  more. No less.  It's very troubling to hear now that  the conferees being named today may  not, in fact, constitute a working ma jority in support of the House position  on this cornerstone issue. That's why  this motion to instruct is so important.  The House  rejected  the ABC ap proach for good reason. The Federal  Government already has 28 day care  programs.  We do not need a 29th, in the form  of a redundant new preschool program  which has the potential to create an  elaborate new bureaucracy at the Fed eral and State levels.  We already have a preschool grant  mechanism that has been in existence  for nearly 30 years. The title XX grant  program-which is part of the Social  Security Act-provides the States with  $2.8 billion  to spend on social pro grams of  their choice.  In practice,  every State but one spends title XX  money on day care.

181,House,101,0.346,727,7,Mr. WHITTAKER.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume. I will reserve the balance of my  time at the conclusion of my speech  for other speakers.  Mr. Speaker, as an original cospon sor of this transportation legislation, I  am proud  to  reaffirm  the Nation's  commitment to Amtrak as part of our  national transportation system. As we  begin to survey the condition of the  Nation's transportation infrastructure,  and to consider the economic and envi ronmental costs of various forms of  transportation, Amtrak's role as a pas senger carrier of high energy efficien cy and low environmental impact be comes  even more  important  than  before. I know that in my own part of  the country, with the severe shrinkage  of the intercity bus system, Amtrak  has become even more important as a  vital transportation link for our small and medium-sized communities, many  of which do not have air  transport  service.  In fact,  there  are  literally  scores of such communities around the  country, where Amtrak is one of the  few  remaining  transportation  links  connecting these towns with the rest  of the Nation. More than one out of  every  five  communities  served  by  Amtrak has no air service; another one  in five has no bus service. For these  towns, Amtrak is truly a vital connec tion to the economic and social fabric  of the Nation.  I also want to stress that Amtrak is  almost unique  among Federal pro grams, in that it has managed to in crease its level of service to the public,  while  cutting  its  Federal  funding  roughly  in half  in constant dollars  over the last decade. How many other  Federal efforts can we name that have  achieved that kind of efficiency and  productivity? These results are also a  tribute  to  the outstanding manage ment skills of Graham Claytor, Am trak's president during most of that  time period.  Sadly, I have to acknowledge that  despite the bipartisan support for this  Amtrak legislation, the administration  is on record as opposing it-primarily,  and to all appearances, exclusively, be cause of a provision giving the Inter state  Commerce  Commission  the  power to screen takeover. bidders who  are not already in the railroad busi ness, before they are allowed to pro ceed with a bid for control of a major  rail carrier.  I can only say that I have to con clude that much of this opposition is  due to being misinformed. This provi sion, which closely tracks a bipartisan  bill drafted in the Energy and Com merce Committee, only closes a non sensical gap in the current law. A com pany or an individual who wants to go  into the railroad business on a small  scale by buying even a few miles of  track from a major railroad must seek  ICC approval. But if the same person  or company wants to enter the rail road business by taking control of a  major railroad in a single stroke, the  ICC has no effective means of scruti nizing the bidder and protecting the  transportation system from a possible  railroad bankruptcy or similar disas ter.  The  takeover  provision  in  the  Amtrak bill addresses this situation in  a moderate, carefully  targeted way.  First, the ICC is not put in charge of  determining  the outcome of control  contests: It is merely authorized  to  screen multiple bidders for fitness; the  takeover contest will be determined by  the shareholders and the marketplace.  Second, the ICC is given a limited 90day window in which to conduct this  screening-not the 21h years that are  available  in mergers or acquisitions  within the railroad industry. Finally,  although the ICC should consider the  effect of a given proposal on employ ees, there is no statutory requirement  for  so-called  labor  protection  pay ments to displaced employees. In con trast to this moderate provision, cur rent law gives employees displaced by  a multicarrier merger or acquisition up  to 6 years of full pay, as a matter of  Federal law. I think these facts speak  for themselves: This is a very moder ate piece of legislation that leaves the  critical aspects of takeover contests in  the free market, while protecting the  public from the possible loss of critical  in our national  transportation  system.  One final note, Mr. Speaker. We are  likely to hear a good deal from certain  links  quarters about this takeover provision  rolling back the Staggers Act or rereg ulating the railroad industry. That is  flatly untrue. As one of the staunchest  defenders of the Staggers Act against  efforts to roll back the genuine im provements  in market-oriented  rate making, I know reregulation when I  see it. And in this case, the takeover  matter, we are dealing with provisions  of the Interstate Commerce Act whose  coverage was not affected one iota by  the Staggers Act. Instead, we are cor recting an anomaly in the statute that  was there long before 1980, but which  became all  too apparent within the  last year or so  as major  railroads  became the targets of noncarrier take over bids. So I ask that our Members  reaffirm their support for this meas ure, as they did last September by a  vote of 296  to 93, and continue  to  evaluate this bill on its merits, not on  the basis of slogans and rhetoric.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the  conference report.  0 1640  ",1990

More  In reflecting that belief and the im portance of the family in the future of  our Nation, George Bush, in lliinois,  speaking  to a group of Republican  women in September 1988, said,  We need to assure that women don't have  to worry about getting their jobs back after  having a child or caring for a child during a  serious illness. That is what I mean when I  talk about a gentler nation.  Let me note that he used the word  assure. Unlike some of his advisers, he  did not say we should urge employers  to do it, he did not say we should hope  employers do it. Obviously urging em ployers will not assure that women or  male care providers in the family will  get their jobs back. The only way we  can do that is by legislation, and the  only way we can do that by legislation  is to adopt this rule and the bill that is  before us today. The President's advis ers should read his  lips and under stand that we need this bill to assure  that care providers are protected.  0 1820  There are some here who suggest  that we are creating some extraordi nary new precedent by this legislation.  I submit that that is not the case at  all, that in fact we have provided re employment mandates in past situa tions.  For example, the Jury Systems Im provement Act of 1978 provides  job  protection for employees who report  for Federal jury service. Many States  have  adopted  similar  legislation  to  protect those who are called for jury  service in the State courts. Under the  Federal veterans' reemployment rights  statute, draftees, reservists, and mem bers of the National Guard are provid ed  certain  employment  protections  while they are away on duty. Persons  inducted  into  or  enlisting  in  the  Armed Forces must be considered as  having been on furlough or leave of  absence during their military training  and. service. The law also prohibits ter mination because of any obligation as  a member of the Reserves.  In other words, Mr. Speaker,  the  idea of the right to return to one's job  after leave has ample precedent in our  Federal statutes. Let us build on that  precedent and extend that right to our  Nation's families, who are entrusted  with no less an important responsibil ity that nurturing the future genera tions of this country.  If we are going to do that, then we  must pass this rule today and we must  pass this bill tomorrow.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the bal ance of my time.  ",1990

186,,101,-0.271,792,7,Mr. BOSCO.," Mr. Speaker, today I have in troduced  legislation which  I believe is crucial  to remedying a chronic problem affecting the  health and vitality of our Nation's air  traffic  control system. The Air Traffic Controller  In centive and Retention Act will attract and  retain qualified personnel to handle safely and  expeditiously the ever-increasing amount of air  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  traffic in our congested skies. My bill is aimed  at boosting system capacity through increased  productivity of the key component of the air  traffic control system:  the controllers  them selves.  It is time that we faced up to facts. The air  traffic control work force has not been rebuilt  to prestrike levels, especially in the number of  full performance level controllers [FPL's]. For  yet another year, the Federal Aviation Admin istration will  fall approximately 2,000 FPL's  short of the congressionally mandated level.  Under the FAA's pay demonstration project,  we have been  trying  to attract and  retain  qualified controllers at some of our most be sieged air traffic control facilities. However, in  order for this project  to succeed, controllers  must often be siphoned off from other busy  and strained facilities which have no control lers to spare. We only have so many fingers  or controllers to plug the holes in this leaking  dike, and we are running out of them.  In  spite  of  promises  to  provide  better  screening  and  education,  the  deplorable  washout percentage at the FAA's Oklahoma  City Academy shows no sign of declining.  More frightening still is the employment crisis  that looms ahead. Beginning  in 1995, almost  half of the controller work force will be eligible  to retire; there are few compelling reasons for  these controllers  to stay on. Sixty-thousand dollar annual salaries are  the exception, not  the rule. Younger controllers are resigning at  an alarming  rate. Last year, at the Oakland  Terminal Radar Approach Control, 17 FPL's  quit-more than a  third of  their actual FPL  work force.  Implementation of  the new National Air space Plan will require so-called bubble staff ing to handle training on new equipment and  concurrent operation of  the air  traff control  [ATC] system. The ATC system cannot shut  down while controllers  learn  to operate  this  new  technology.  And  the  so-called  labor  saving equipment of the NAS plan  is contin gent upon greater reliance on existing FAA  personnel.  The lessons of the past 9 years are clear.  While we have been fighting a series of pro tracted skirmishes at individual air traffic con trol facilities, we have been losing the overall  battle to provide safe and effective and traffic  control. We must be able to attract and retain  the  best  possible  people  throughout  the  Nation, not just at a few  locations.  I believe  my legislation will accomplish this goal by rais ing the controller pay differential from 5 to 15  percent, offering premium pay  for Saturday  work, and eliminating the age limitation on vol untary retirement for controllers with 20 years  of service.  I believe  that  this money would be well  spent. We are currently wasting millions of  dollars on ill-suited controller candidates who  fail at the academy or who cannot certify at  their air traffic control facilities. We are losing  to  retirement and  resignation, controllers  in  whom the Government has invested between  $100,000 and $200,000 and whose value  to  our safety and  the economy  is  inestimable.  This is unacceptable.  Half measures and public  relations cam paigns will no longer do. We must attract can didates who have the qualifications and apti tude  to make  it  through  the academy and  May 9, 1990  pass muster in  the air traffic control system.  We must ensure  that controllers stay  in  that  system as productive and active members  doing what they do best: separating aircraft.  We must build and sustain a vibrant work  force committed to excellence in order to in crease  the margin of safety and system ca pacity. That is exactly what my legislation will  do and  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.  I would like to thank the National Air Traffic  Controllers Association  for  their assistance  over the past months. Their observations and  expertise were most helpful and I look forward  to working with  them as well as  the entire  aviation community, and the U.S. flying public  to make this legislation a reality.  CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR  HEAD START JUSTIFIED  HON. DOUG BEREUTER  OF NEBRASKA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 9, 1990  ",1990
187,,101,0.231,792,7,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, Head Start is  a favorite program among Members of Con gress, and for very good reason.  It is a pro gram that works! Studies of Head Start reveal  that children who participate  in  the program  do better in school, are less likely to drop out,  and make better social and emotional adjust ments to the learning environment.  Often times Members of Congress have to  sell big ticker items to their constituents, who  are concerned about the size of the Federal  deficit and the damage that deficit may do to  the  financial  security of  future generations.  The budget submitted by President Bush  re quested an increase of $500 million for Head  Start,  to a  record high  total of $1.9 billion.  There  is no question that whatever levels of  funding for Head Start Congri;iss approves will  be Federal dollars well spent.  This Members' constituents in Beatrice, NE  know about  this effective program as well.  Thanks  to  the  following  excellent editorial  from  the Beatrice Daily Sun,  this Member's  support of the Head Start Program at home is  made all the easier.  [From the Beatrice Daily Sun, May 4, 19901  LARGER HEAD START PROGRAM IMPORTANT  (By Kent Thomas)  Without any specific numbers to back me  up, I still believe that the large majority of  toddlers who attend and enjoy pre-school  will go on to become above-average students  and make a success of their lives.  Sure,  there will be exceptions,  for any  number of reasons, but I think the general ization is valid.  The  pre-school  experience  is  probably  more  important for children of disadvan taged families than others because it pro vides a learning opportunity that might not  otherwise be possible. Often, young people  in poverty-stricken or broken homes don't  get the chance to learn as much at home as  they should.  Which brings us to the Head Start pro gram, called by Helen Blank of the Chil dren's Defense Fund ""the most popular low income  program  because  of  its  unique  nature in addressing so many problems at  ",1990
188,House,101,-0.347,818,7,Mr. MOODY.," Madam Chairman, as  an economist, I just want to make two  brief points about this bill. One, it is  cost effective to pass this bill, and two,  it is not anticompetitive.  On cost effective, let me make this  point briefly: as long as there is a wel fare system in our country, and there  always will be, and thank goodness we  have a  safety net, as  long as  that  exists,  then someone on a very  low  income who  is working who has to  leave that job and be fired because  they want to take care of the first few  weeks of their child's new life, that  person may not get back to work for  quite a while.  We  all  know  that  the  longer  a  person is off work, the harder it is to  regain employment. So  that person,  yes, the employer may have the lack  of a mandate, so-called, but society  picks up an extra welfare bill. It is ex pensive to put people on welfare. That  balances very close for some people at  the low income level.  So we should do everything we can  to make sure people for whom welfare  is an alternative in fact have every in centive to stay on the job. So it is cost  effective from a budgetary point of  view.  No.  2,  competitiveness. Over  100  countries,  our  trading  competitors,  have this provision. In fact, many of  them  have  paid  family  leave,  not  unpaid, as this would be.  I  think  it  is a  slander on United  States business to say that our busi nesses need an extra margin, an extra  edge, in order to be competitive. I do  not believe that. I  think the United  States business can compete on the  same footing with Japan and Germa ny and Korea and France and England, all those countries that have this  provision. Why is it uncompetitive for  us to have it when our business in fact  is productive.  This is not anticompetitive. It puts  us on the same playing field and it is  humane for our own people. So on eco nomic grounds alone, not to mention  compassion  grounds,  pro-family  grounds,  this measure  should  be  passed.  ",1990
189,House,101,0.283,818,7,Mr. GRANDY.," Madam Chairman, I  yield myself 5 minutes.  Madam  Chairman,  as  we  begin  round two on the parental family and  medical leave debate this morning, let  me call to mind the words of our de parted  retired  colleague, Mr. Gene  Taylor of Missouri, who had a pretty  good way to assess the value of legisla tion. He had three criteria. One was  who does it really help;  two  is how  much does it really cost; and three, if  it  is  really necessary, how have we  gotten along without it for this long?  Let us begin with who  this really  helps. Well,  the gentlewoman  from  New Jersey [Mrs. RoUKEMA] has said  dual family incomes, and that is prob ably true. But can it be argued that it  helps single  family  income earners,  either single parents or parents with  one person earning income, or those  families with $11,000 or less annual  income?  Probably not, because  they are at  the  lower end of the spectrum and  cannot afford  to  take  that benefit.  These are not just my words. The New  York Times today in an editorial has  said as much.  Let me ask who it really helps in  terms of families, in terms of bonding.  Does this really help a young working  couple with kids older than newborns  who might be more concerned with  the first 10 years of life than the first  10 weeks, who might need additional  child care benefits over and above  what we are trying to do in H.R. 3? No,  because their ability to negotiate that  benefit will probably be proscribed by  this mandate.  Will it help that young child that  might have a congenital birth defect,  let us say kidney disease? Yes, sure, 12  weeks of unpaid leave is valuable, but  is it as good as extra medical coverage  that might pay for the dialysis ma chine or the transplant?  Who are we  really  trying  to help  here? Who is really going to take ad vantage of this legislation? How much  does it really cost? Five dollars per em ployee. Of course, that is up from $4  last year, and that is based only on the  cost of health care, which, by the way,  grows at 30 percent every year.  But that does not figure in the quad ruple damages which will be assessed  under this bill if you are found in vio lation. It does not figure in litigation.  It does not figure  in the retraining  costs, the costs of going out and re",1990
190,House,101,-0.404,831,7,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Chairman,  today  the  House of Representatives has a historic op portunity to help American families. By pass ing the Family and Medical Leave Act we are  recognizing  the  relationship between  family  obligations and professional responsibilities.  This is a vote for the American family, an in stitution that has come under hard times lately  and  truly needs and deserves  this kind of  boost.  The substitute that will be offered by Repre sentatives GORDON and WELDON presents a  generous compromise that both protects the  leave provisions of the bill and takes into con sideration the concerns raised by the business  community.  As someone who has spent many years ad vocating the strengthening of our foster care  and child welfare systems,  I strongly support  this bill. At a time when American families are  breaking apart because of drug use, divorce,  and child abuse,  this legislation eases some  of  the conflicts and burdens many  families  face.  The provisions of this bill are especially criti cal to adoptive and foster families. Presently,  there are over 31,000 children in the United  States waiting to be adopted; some 240,000  children are presently  living  in  family-foster care situations. These children and their adop tive or foster parents need time to bond and  become a family.  A  large portion of these children  living  in  foster care are older and have been the vic tims of sexual or physical abuse. Adjusting to  a new family is not easy, but being able to  take time off from a job to bond with a new  child can help ease the transition.  Caring for a new family member can be tre mendously stressful. By denying parents the  opportunity to take a short leave to get their  family  together, we compound  this stress.  Imagine the conflicts a new parent must ad dress if they have to choose between getting  to know their newly-adopted child, who is ex periencing  emotional  trauma  after  being  placed in the home, and keeping the job that  allows the parent to put food on the table, to  clothe, and to protect that youth.  We cannot, and should not, continue to ask  parents to choose between earning a living or  fulfilling their obligations to their families.  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of  the Gordon-Weldon substitute. American fami lies are depending upon us.  ",1990
191,House,101,-0.321,831,7,Mr. SYNAR.," Madam Chairman, today I rise  in support of the Family and Medical Leave  Act because it strikes the proper balance be tween family and work responsibilities.

192,House,101,-0.631,870,7,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, we are facing two  serious long-term crises that we must begin to  address-global warming and the budget defi cit. The good news is that there is one solu tion  to achieving  the twin goals of reducing  global warming and  the budget deficit.  It  is  market-oriented and it works. The solution is a  carbon tax.  The problem of the budget deficit is well known and unquestioned. Headlines are filled  with talk of budget summits and the need to  raise billions of dollars to avoid massive dis ruptions in Government services. The amount  of money needed  to stave off dire conse quences mounts  relentlessly. Virtually every  number dealing with the predicted size of the  deficit has been underestimated.  Let's tum to global warming. Virtually every  serious climate scientist says we need to act  immediately  to  reduce carbon dioxide emis sions. The major conclusion from 300 scien tists and policy makers from 46 countries and  the United Nations at the World Conference,  Toronto, canada, June 1988 was ""Humanity  is  conducting  an  unintended,  uncontrolled,  globally pervasive experiment whose ultimate  consequences could be  second only  to a  global nuclear war. Far-reaching impacts will  be caused by global warming and sea-level  rise, which are becoming increasingly evident  as a result of continued growth in atmospheric  concentrations of carbon dioxide and other  greenhouse gases.  It  is  imperative  to act  now.""  Agreeing with this call to action is the Inter parliamentary Conference on the Global Envi ronment  in  their May 2, 1990, declaration.  Representing  42  countries,  they  issued  a  series of declarations, including calling for re ductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 50  percent from 1990 levels  in  the year 2010.  November  7,  1989,  President  Bush  an nounced that ""the United States has agreed  with other industrialized nations that stabiliza tion of carbon dioxide emissions should be  achieved as soon as possible."" The Group of  7 Summit July 16, 1989, said,  ""We strongly  advocate common efforts to limit emissions of  carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,  which threaten to induce climate change, endangering the environment and ultimately the  economy.  Mr. Speaker, heeding these calls to action, I  am introducing a carbon tax. A carbon tax is  an effective market-oriented tool that will ben efit both  the environment and the economy.  My tax on chlorofluorocarbons [CFC's], which  became law on January 1, 1990, has clearly  led to a change in CFC use and has dramati cally increased recycling of CFC's. In addition,  it is contributing billions of dollars to the U.S.  Treasury. A carbon tax could have the same  positive effect on reducing carbon emissions  while simultaneously reducing the deficit.  Advocates of a market-based approach are  many. Professor of Economics at Yale Univer sity William Nordhaus said in the March/ April  issue of EPA Journal ""Consumption of fossil  fuels has many negative spillovers besides the  greenhouse effect, such as  local pollution,  traffic congestion, and so forth. In addition to  slowing global warming, carbon  taxes would  restrain  the consumption of fossil  fuels, en courage R&D on nonfossil fuels like methane,  lower oil imports, reduce the trade and budget  deficits, and  raise  the national saving rate.""  The Economic Report of the President, Febru ary 1990, says ""a fee or a tradeable allow ances scheme would  lead  firms and  individ uals to consider the social cost of greenhouse  emissions in their private decisions. Because  market-based  approaches  are  flexible  and  provide incentives that affect decisions at all  points  along  the  production-consumption  chain and across all industries, they automati cally  focus on  those activities where emis sions reductions can be achieved at the least  cost.''  Industry segments have expressed strong  support for a carbon tax. Helen 0. Petrauskas,  vice president for environment and safety en gineering at Ford Motor Co., appearing before  a Senate subcommittee on April 4, 1990, testi fied ""* * * Government should also consider  a  'greenhouse' or carbon  fee that might be  applied  to all  fuels  that emit carbon dioxide  when burned * * * at whatever source."" At  the same hearing Dr. Marina Whitman, vice  president at General Motors, said, ""Wouldn't it  make better sense  to create  incentives  to  induce all emitting sources  to  reduce  their  emissions rather than focus attention virtually  exclusively on one particular activity  in  re sponding to the concern about global warm ing? Because ~ is a byproduct of all types  of fossil fuel combustion, wouldn't a fee struc ture tied to the level of carbon content of vari ous fossil fuels be the fairer approach, as well  as more effective?""  President Bush, speaking before the  Inter governmental Panel on Climate Change on  February 5, 1990, challenged ""As we work to  create policy and agreements on action, we  want  to encourage  the most creative ap proaches. Wherever possible, we believe that  market mechanisms should be applied-and  that our policies must be consistent with eco nomic growth and free market principles in all  countries."" The carbon  tax meets  the chal lenge of a free market approach. The burning  of carbon currently does not pay its societal  cost. The tax will ensure that it does.  Mr. Speaker, the carbon tax that I am intro ducing today is modest in its effort to address  carbon dioxide emissions. The tax will bring  about a substantial reduction in growth of U.S.  carbon dioxide emissions over  the next 1 O  years. The tax is the equivalent of putting a  $25 a ton charge on carbon in fuels.  The carbon tax will be phased in over a 5year period. The tax on coal will be $3 per ton  starting in 1991, rising  to $15 by 1995. The  tax on petroleum will start at $.65 per barrel  rising to $3.25. For natural gas, the tax starts  at $.08 per MCF rising to $.40 when phased  in.  The amount of money raised by the carbon  tax is $6 billion in the first year. The carbon  tax will  rise by approximately $6 billion per  year, contributing more  than $30 billion per  year to deficit reduction when fully implement ed.  Mr. Speaker, as the global military threats  fade, we must focus on  the  two things that  threaten our national security-environmental  destruction and the budget deficit. There is no  doubt .that a carbon tax can lead the charge in  attacking the heart of both of those problems.  CONGRESSMAN  ANNUNZIO  SA LUTES NATION'S POLICE OFFI CERS  ",1990
193,House,101,-0.398,870,7,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise to call  to the attention of my colleagues in the House  of Representatives that the week of May 13  through 19 will be observed as National Police  Week, and I would like to take this opportunity  to pay tribute to the law enforcement officers  across our Nation who protect our children  and our families and keep our cities and our  country safe.  Once a year it is quite fitting for us to recog nize these public servants who daily put their  lives on  the  line  to protect us  from  theft,  murder, and drug-related crimes which have  afflicted our Nation. Their efforts are often  taken  for granted and  go  unnoticed,  and  therefore  the celebration of ""National Police  Week"" gives our country a chance  to say  ""thank you.""  In 1984 when  I became chairman of the  House Administration Committee, one of my  first actions was to move for swift passage of  legislation to build the National Law Enforce ment Officers Memorial. This memorial, which  is now being built solely with private contribu tions  from about one-half million  individuals  and 200 corporations, is testimony to the re spect and admiration our society has for our  law enforcement officers, who are at the front  line of protecting our homes and our families.  This memorial, which is being constructed at  Judiciary Square, is expected to be completed  in the spring of 1991 and is a stirring tribute to  the men and women who have made the ulti mate sacrifice for our safety.  March 15 is also  the 75th anniversary of  Peace Officers Memorial Day. Signed  into  public law by President Kennedy on October  1, 1962,  this  legislation pays  tribute  to  the  Federal, State, and municipal officers who  have been killed or disabled  in  the  line of  duty, and recognizes the tremendous service  and sacrifice given by  the brave men and  ",1990
194,Senate,101,0.1,896,7,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President, I want  to call my colleagues' attention to a  matter which I believe is of great importance.

196,,101,-0.291,974,7,Mr. DONNELLY.," Mr. Speaker, the Subcom mittee on Select Revenue Measures of  the  Committee on Ways and Means is currently in  the process of considering modifications  to  the tax treatment of life insurance companies.  At issue is a true measure of a life insurance  company's  income  for purposes of imposing  the Federal income tax.  As a member of that Subcommittee, I have  been closely  involved  in  this process, and  I  have been paying close attention to potential ly disturbing trends in the industry. Clearly, our  Subcommittee has two obligations during our  deliberations: the first is to enact sound, legiti mate  income  tax policy. The  second  is  to  insure that life insurance company policyhold ers are protected.  To that end,  I would like to have printed in  the RECORD an article from the July 10, 1989  issue of Forbes magazine entitled  ""You Bet  Your Life."" The article points out that all may  not be well in the life insurance industry, and  highlights some disturbing trends that all of us  should be aware of during  this debate. We  should be cautioned by  the debacle  in  the  savings and  loan  industry and  further cau tioned by  the  fact  that  the Federal Govern ment has no protection available to life insur ance company policyholders who lose their in vestment if the company through which  they  own their policy goes bankrupt.  Perhaps the time has come for greater Fed eral regulation of the insurance industry gen erally. Certainly,  the Federal  tax  laws are an  appropriate place to start. Nonetheless, I think  that the Forbes article bears close attention,  and I urge my colleagues to study it carefully.  [From Forbes Magazine, July 10, 1989]  You BET YOUR LIFE  <By Gretchen Morgenson>  Of the 155 million Americans who own  some form of life insurance, few are fully  aware of  the  industry's eroding  financial  base and its rising rate of failures. This ig norance  is not bliss. Unlike customers at  banks and  savings and  loan  institutions,  people who trust their money to life insur ance companies are not protected by a fed eral bailout mechanism.  No, we're not predicting massive failures  among  life companies, as happened with  savings and loans and,  to a  lesser extent,  commercial  banks. But only  an  ostrich  would ignore signs of a seriously deteriorat ing situation.  ""The freewheeling approach of some  in  the insurance industry may put these com panies on a crash course similar to the route  taken by many of our nation's S&L's,"" says  Thomas Wheeler, chief executive of Massa chusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., the nation's 11th-largest life insurer. Mass Mutual  is widely  regarded as one of  the sounder  companies, and Wheeler is referring to life  companies that have been taking excessive  risks in their investment portfolios.  Life insurance isn't supposed to be a risky  business. But since 1987 some two dozen life  insurance companies have defaulted. This  marks a sharp departure from the previous  two decades, when the failure rate was run ning at about one life insurer per year.  So far, the failed companies have been rel atively small. The annual bailout costs have  jumped from less than $9 milion in 1982 to  about $70 million on average in the past two  years. Most of the losses  to policyholders  have been made good by healthy insurance  outfits under various state guaranty fund  systems. But if the failures mount, this pro  bono publico policy will give way to simple  self-preservation.  If the problems were  limited  to a  few  highfliers, they could be fairly easily con tained. Unfortunately,  they are not. The  same high-risk strategies and  investments  that forced some small insurers into insol vency are now nagging some of  the big name life companies like Equitable Life As surance Society, Travelers  Insurance and  I.C.H. Corp. Across  the  industry, balance  sheets have weakened dramatically. Five  years ago all the life insurance companies  followed by the rating agencies were rated  Aaa; today only 40% have that top rating,  according to Moody's Investors Service.  What are the trouble signs? Perhaps the  most alarming is shrinking capital and sur plus accounts, which are meant to cushion  against unforeseen risk. One key measure  compares capital with portfolio risk. Using  100 as an adequate level of capital needed to  compensate for portfolio risk, an index com piled by Moody's shows a steady decline,  from 110  four years ago  to 96  today see  chart, opposite).  Another dicey development  is  the  fact  that more and more mutual life insurers are  being  forced  to  reduce dividends paid  to  their policy holders-a clear indication of a  profit squeeze. Last year Mutual of New  York, with $24 billion in assets, reduced its  dividend by 3.5%. Manufacturers Life Insur ance Co., with $19.9 billion in assets has cuts  its rates 4.3% over the past two years.  It is hardly reassuring to note that many  insurance companies are starting to employ  questionable accounting  techniques to  im prove the look of their net capital positions.  Late last year, for example, two large life in surers  entered  into unusual  transactions  with Citibank. General American Life Insur ance Co. of St. Louis ($5.1 billion, assets)  and Washington National Insurance of Ev anston,  Ill.  ($1.9 billion, assets> sold Citi bank future premiums worth $75 million  and $30 million,  respectively. These sales  had the effect of boosting both companies'  net capital positions because  the  insurers  immediately booked as assets the $75 mil lion and $30 million they received from Citi bank. But what  the bookkeeping entries  didn't show was  that both  insurers had  mortgaged some of their future cash flow.  Indeed, a few months ago the New York  State  superintendent of  insurance  ruled  Forum  Insurance  that the sale of future premiums is really a  loan, and so an amount equal to the premi um sale should appear as a liability on the  insurer's balance sheet. The superintendent  found the Citibank deals ""inconsistent with  statutory accounting principles."" But  the  sales have not been officially disallowed, nor  have the insurers restated their financials.  These transactions are nothing more than  an effort to mask capital depletions. With out them, Washington National would have  shown a $13 million statutory loss in capital  for 1988, and General American would have  had a $4 million decrease.  The stakes are mounting. The amount of  money that changed hands in these transac tions was relatively small. But word has it  that similar premium sales are being consid ered by two industry giants. Equitable Life  Assurance Society and  the Massachusetts  Indemnity & Life Insurance Co., a subsidi ary of A.L. Williams. Warns Joseph Belth,  editor  of  newsletter,  ""When these guys begin to play games like  this, you may be getting closer to a disas ter.""  What's behind the balance sheet deterio ration? A classic profit squeeze. Life insur ance marketing and sales expenses have  continued to rise over the past few years,  but the nation's increasingly sophisticated  consumers are demanding products such as  universal life policies and annuities, leaving  insurers with slim profits, at best. Gone are  the days when simple whole  life policies  made up the bulk of an insurer's business.  Life  insurers, pitted against mutual funds  and brokerage firms for America's invest ment dollar, have in some cases resorted to  wildly aggressive tactics.  A case in point is Equitable, the giant in surer that got into big trouble with guaran teed investment contracts. Back in the late  1970s and early 1980s premium inflow from  consumers was slowing down, so Equitable  took  in money , to manage  from pension  funds at huge companies like General Dy namics and General Electric. To attract the  business, Equitable-and others-promised  higher long-term rates of returns than their  investment managers  could  realistically  hope to generate.  Other examples are I.C.H., a publicly held  Louisville, KY company that's big in univer sal life policies, and Integon, a sizable annu ity seller that troubled Southmark agreed  to sell in May. Both have seen the quality of  their  capital  bases  decline  significantly.  Knickerbocker Life Insurance, a 70-year-old  company out of El Paso, failed in May. The  company, which came up $22 million short  in receivership, was a big seller of annuities  with overly optimistic payout rates.  Low-profit and no-profit products-com bined with cutthroat competition-have hit  life  insurers hard. Nationwide,  the  indus try's returns on  surplus capital-roughly  equivalent to returns on equity for nonin surance companies-have steadily declined  from 15% in 1984 to 9.5% today.  Balance  sheets  have  deteriorated,  too.  During the 1980s, life insurers invested bil lions of dollars in junk bonds. Many compa nies were virtually forced to go for the high est yields because of the guaranteed invest  This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

PAT WILLIAMS  OF MONTANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 10, 1990  ",1990
198,,101,-0.315,987,7,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Speaker, today, I am in troducing, with my colleague from Pennsylva nia Mr. GOODLING,  the National Summit Con ference on Education Amendments of 1990.  Congress  enacted  the original  education  summit conference  legislation  in 1984. The  purpose of that legislation was to have an in clusive, organized discussion about proposals  for education  reform and about how  those  proposals could be implemented. That discus sion was to involve concerned individuals rep resenting all areas of education, business,  labor, and  the public.  It was be an  inclusive  approach, recognizing  that if we as a nation  are going to solve the problems facing educa tion, we must involve as many people as pos sible in the consideration of how those prob lems can be solved.  Since  the  initial enactment of  the summit  legislation in 1984, a number of events have  occurred. Congress has taken the necessary  steps to implement the summit. It has appoint ed  its Members  to  the summit's executive  committee.  The  Congress  appropriated  $500,000  to carry out  the activities of  the  summit. But  to date the all-inclusive summit  envisioned by Public Law 98-524 has yet to  come about.  The amendments we  offer  today  to  the  1984 law will conclude as Congress intended.  This  legislation changes  the composition of  the original executive committee. And, given  the action  to date by  the President and  the  Governors, it amends the summit's agenda to  include a consideration of  the now existing  goals and recommendations. Finally the legis lation encourages the critical determination as  to how  these goals might be  implemented,  and what levels of government have responsi bilities to bear in that implementation.  Mr. Speaker,  if we are to be successful in  reforming education in this Nation, we need to  involve the people who are to carry out those  reforms. The  legislation Mr. GOODLING and  I  introduce today is the final  legislative step in  that direction.  RUTHLESS ASSASSINATION OF  DR. KAZEM RAJAVI  10117  HON. JIM BATES  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 10, 1990  ",1990
199,,101,-0.279,987,7,Mr. BATES.," Mr. Speaker, I am certain many  of you, with great sadness, have  learned of  the  ruthless  assassination  of  a prominent  human  rights activist, Dr. Kazem Rajavi, by  the  Iranian  regime's mercenaries  in  recent  weeks. Dr. Rajavi, an outstanding international  representative of the  Iranian people's resist ance for peace and freedom, was the brother  of Mr. Massoud Rajavi,  the president of the  National Council of Resistance of  Iran, who  has perspicaciously  led a popular resistance  against the Tehran clerical tyranny for almost  a decade.  Dr. Rajavi devoted the last 19 years of his  life to unrelented activities against the dicta torships of the Shah and Khomeini. He often  attended  various  international  conferences  and forums to expose the unabated violations  of human rights in Iran and to defend the very  rights  that the  Iranian people had  fought  for  and sacrificed so many  lives  for under  the  Shah's tyranny.  After  the  fall of the Shah, Dr. Rajavi was  Iran's first Ambassador to the U.N. headquar ters in Geneva. However, shortly after his ap pointment, he resigned his post in protest to  the repressive policies and  terrorist activities  of the ruling clerics in Iran. He then intensified  his campaign against mass executions, arbi trary arrests, and the medieval tortures exer cised by the clerics in Tehran. Since the for mation of the National Council of Resistance  in 1981, Dr. Rajavi had been representing the  Iranian Resistance  in many  international as semblies, and every year headed  the  resist ance delegation to the U.N. General Assembly  in New York and  the Commission of Human  rights  in Geneva. His constant and effective  efforts, prompting international attention to the  horrible situation in  Iran, resulted  in condem nation of the Iranian clerical despotism by the  United Nations and a variety of other human  rights organizations in the past few years.  Dr. Rajavi was a resident of France  from  1957  to 1968, and subsequently  resided  in  Switzerland, where  he was  given  political  asylum. He received six doctorate degrees in  the fields of law, political science and sociolo gy from the universities of Paris and Geneva,  where he held professorship's post in the last  10 years.  Due to his active and effective role in con demning  the medieval autocracy  ruling  Iran,  the  regime's authorities despised him  and  plotted his murder. On many occasions, he  was reportedly threatened with death by the  Khomeini regime's terrorist-diplomats and per sonal envoys of Rafsanjani, the Iranian Presi dent,  to Europe. Nonetheless, he constantly  and bravely confronted Khomeini's agents in  the various organs of the United Nations, en gaging  in a  full-fledged struggle  for human  rights and for helping to establish a democrat ically  elected government by  the National  Council of Resistance of Iran.

In 1790  the Hebrew congregation in Newport,  RI, was  so  fearful  of  persecution,  there was an escape door and tunnel  put in the middle of the temple. Our  first President, George Washington,  took up his pen and wrote to this har assed  congregation. His words  and  vision  give  me  goosebumps,  they  convey the very essence of America's  foundation being grounded in religious  tolerance. I include the text of George  Washington's letter:  To  the Hebrew Congregation  RI.  Gentlemen, while I receive with much sat isfaction your address replete with expresAUGUST 17, 1790.  in Newport,  sions of affection and esteem, I  rejoice in  the opportunity of assuring you that I shall  always  retain a grateful  remembrance of  the cordial welcome  I experienced  in my  visit to Newport from all classes of Citizens.  The reflection on the days of difficulty  and danger which are past is rendered the  more sweet from a consciousness that they  are succeeded by days of uncommon pros perity and security. If we have the wisdom  to make the best use of the advantages with  which we are now favored, we cannot fail,  under the just administration of a good gov ernment  to  become  a  great  and happy  people.  The Citizens  of  the United States of  America have a right to applaud themselves  for having given to Mankind examples of an  enlarged and liberal policy, a policy worthy  of imitation. All possess alike liberty of con science and immunities of citizenship. It is  now no more that toleration is spoken of, as  if it was by the indulgence of one class of  people, that another enjoyed the exercise of  their inherent natural rights. For happily  the Government  of  the United  States,  which gives to bigotry no sanction, to perse cution no assistance, requires only that they  who live under its protection should demean  themselves as good citizens, in giving it on  all occasions their effectual support.  It would be inconsistent with the frank ness of my character not to avow that I am  pleased with your favorable opinion of my  administration, and fervent wishes for my  felicity.  May the children of the Stock of Abra ham, who dwell  in this land, continue  to  merit and enjoy the good will of the other  inhabitants, while  every one  shall sit  in  safety under his own vine and fig tree, and  there shall be none to make him afraid.

We  have enjoyed his services for many,  many years, for 20 years as a consult ant to the attending physician, and for  the past 4 years as the attending phy sician of  the Congress.

211,,101,-0.553,1182,7,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, Friday, May  18 marks the release date of a book about a  remarkable American. ""Goya, Come Home"" is  the biography of Coya Knutson, Minnesota's  first woman  to be elected  to a  full  term  in  Congress.  The title of the book refers to a letter from  Goya's husband, asking her  to give up her  congressional career after 4 years and return  to Minnesota. The  letter was  leaked  to  the  press and grabbed the attention of the voters  in Goya's rural district.  It also brought on her  defeat in the next election.  In her short  tenure  in Washington,  from  1955 through 1959, Goya Knutson's career is  studded with remarkable accomplishments:  She was the first woman appointed to the  House Agriculture Committee. Acting on  the  counsel  of my  predecessor, Congressman  John Blatnik, Coya wrote  to Speaker Sam  Rayburn and Majority Leader John McCor mack asking for the appointment.  Rayburn appointed her  to  the committee  over the protests of its chairman, Representa tive Harold Cooley. The Speaker responded to  Cooley's objections by  telling  the chairman,  ""Coya Knutson did  the  impossible by getting  elected and she's going  to get her pick of  committees.""  Knutson  and  Cooley  later  became good friends.  As a member of the Agriculture Committee,  Coya was a champion of the family farm. She  was  instrumental  in establishing credit pro grams  for  farm  improvement and expansion.  She worked for price supports for sugar beet  farmers and supported soil conservation pro grams. She helped enlarge the Federal school  lunch program as a solution  to farm surplus  problems. Her first speech on the House floor  pleaded  for maintaining  farm price supports,  declaring  that  ""adequate  farm  income  is a  task we must achieve for the economic health  and welfare of the country.""  In 1957, Americans looked upward and saw  the Soviet Sputnik orbiting  the Earth. Our  post-war bubble of euphoria burst and new ini tiatives in education were needed. Goya Knut son introduced the ""Dollars for Scholars"" Pro gram to help worthy students afford a college  education. ""Even though education  is a right  in a democracy,"" she  told her House col leagues, ""we have seen destitute students go  by unnoticed. The opportunity for capable stu dents to go to college is the latest horizon to  be faced."" Her program was written into title II  of  the National Defense Education Act of  May '14, 1990  1958 and  enabled a generation of young  people to receive college degrees.  She proposed an omnibus education bill  that would channel one-fourth of the defense  budget into elementary and secondary educa tion. Although  this bill-nicknamed  the Paul  Bunyan bill, after  the north country  lumber jack who accomplished great things-did not  pass during her term in office, a modified ver sion of it passed during the Kennedy adminis tration and became the first large-scale Feder al Education Program.  The first Federal grant to support cystic fi brosis research was the result of Goya's work.  H.R. 12331, passed May 5, 1958, appropri ated $1 million  to  fight  this disease, at  that  time  the  third  leading  killer of children. A  major portion of the funds was awarded to the  University of Minnesota, and Coya was hon ored  for her efforts by  the Minneapolis-St.  Paul chapter of  the Cystic Fibrosis Founda tion.  It was Goya Knutson who proposed a Fed eral  income  tax checkoff  to support public  funding  for Presidential campaigns. Like  the  Paul  Bunyan  bill,  this  legislation  did  not  become  law until after Coya had  left Con gress.  These accomplishments are chronicled  in  ""Coya Come Home,""  the biography of Coya  Knutson by Gretchen Urnes Beito.  I recom mend  this  book  to my  colleagues  in  the  House.  Goya Knutson was a dedicated and able  legislator. She was a champion of working  people and  family  farmers. She worked  to  educate our children and keep them healthy.  She was cut from the same cloth as Senator  Hubert Humphrey, with whom  she worked  very closely. Her accomplishments and  the  spirit with which she achieved them make me  proud  to continue  the  tradition of service  to  the people of Minnesota in Congress.  Goya Knutson  is  now a 77-years-young  grandmother,  living  in Bloomington, MN. She  will be the guest of honor at a special recep tion hosted by Governor and Mrs. Rudy Per pich at the Governor's residence on May 18,  to celebrate the release of her biography.  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, please join me  in paying  tribute to a very special  lady, Con gresswoman Coya Knutson.

214,Senate,101,0.078,1260,7,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce a joint resolution to  commemorate the 50th anniversary of  the National Federation of the Blind.  The National  Federation  of  the  Blind was  founded  in Wilkes-Barre,  PA, on November 16, 1940 and is the  largest organization of  the blind  in  America. It has a membership of over  50,000 is organized in every State and  the District of Columbia, and has local  chapters in almost every community.  Since  its inception,  the purpose of  the federation has been to achieve se curity, equality, and opportunity for  the blind, as well as serving as a vehi cle for self expression of the blind.  National recognition of the 50th an niversary of the National Federation  'lf  the Blind will  also  honor  the  memory of  its founder, Dr. Jacobus  tenBroek. Blind himself, Dr. tenBroek  was a noted scholar of constitutional  law and legal history at the University  of California at Berkeley during the  1950's and 1960's. He pioneered  the  philosophy  that  blindness  was  a  ""normal characteristic,"" and it is not  any more limiting to a person than a  thousand other conditions. His exem plary work in the field of constitution al  law and  legal history personified  this  philosophy  and  improved  the  public image of blindness.  For 28 years, Dr. tenBroek was the  able  leader of  the organized blind  movement in this country and around  the world. In 1968 Dr. Kenneth Jerni gan succeeded him, first as president  and later as executive director of the  National  Federation  of  the Blind.  Through the inspiration and ability of  these exceptional  leaders  the public  perception of blindness has improved  over the past 50 years. The f edera tion's goal, ""changing what it means  to be blind,"" is now coming true.  Mr. President,  the  lOlst Congress  marks a watershed in the fight of the  disabled and blind persons to gain re spect and independence. Last fall, the  Senate passed the Americans with Dis abilities Act and I hope Mr. President,  that the House of Representatives will  soon follow so that we may enact this  important legislation into law.  Mr. President,  there are scores of  talented blind individuals who are not  seeking assistance, but simply an op portunity to become productive mem bers of our society. The National Fed eration of the Blind's programs help  blind  people  to  become  productive  members  of  society.  It  is  for  this  ",1990
215,House,101,0.351,1286,7,Mr. ROTH.," Mr.  Speaker, more  Americans are killed  in  the Philip pines, and the Philippine Government  does nothing. No one is apprehended  nor punished. There is nothing new in  that.  I have a question: we have 40,000  Americans in the Philippines to pro tect the Philippines. Protect the Phil ippines  from who?  If the American  people ever get  the truth about  the  hundreds of millions,  the billions we  are pumping  into the Philippines  to  keep  these unneeded bases,  they are  going to be totally outraged and total ly incensed. The Philippine people do  not want nor need  the bases. The  American people do not want nor need  the bases.  It is time to live in the 21st century.  It is time to save billions. It is time to  start a new page in history. It is time  to do the will of the people. It is time  to close the bases in the Philippines.  THE REALITY OF THE BUDGET,  TAXES, AND SPENDING CUTS  <Mr. DORGAN  of North Dakota  asked and was given permission to ad dress the House for 1 minute and to  revise and extend his remarks.)  ",1990
216,House,101,-0.267,1286,7,Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota.," Mr.  Speaker,  reality  is knocking at  the  front door of the White House. This  intrusion in a fiscal policy dreamland  comes from  radically bloated budget  deficit projections,  a  result  in part  from a softening economy, and in part  from the exploding cost of the savings  and  loan  industry scandal  that has  rocked this country.  The talk now of budget deficit sum mits,  taxes, and spending cuts  is  a  grim reminder of both a fiscal policy  desperately off track and, in the case  of the savings and loan industry mess,  of an administration  that  failed  to  govern effectively resulting in perhaps  the costliest  financial  failure  in  the  history of America.  Those who assumed  their posts  in  the Reagan administration during the  1980's, and who were part of the team  to  ""get  government  off America's  back,""  created  a  type of  economic  casino in which the fat cats were gorg ing, playing  their speculative games  while  the American  taxpayers were  being set up to pay for the losses.  If ever  there's  a  lesson describing  the need for careful government regu lation in sensitive industries such as fi nancial  industries,  that  lesson came  from  the incompetence of the 1980's  when the American people were stolen  blind and a good number of the so called regulators were driving the get away car.  The cost of the savings and loan in dustry bailout  is  now  estimated by  some to be over $300 billion. Is it any  wonder that the President and others  have finally decided it is now time for  some sober discussion a  ut how to fix  this country's  fiscal policy mess? Let  us hope it is not too late, and let us  hope as we fix this mess, we prevent  the savings and  loan bailout scandal  and others like it from ever occurring  again.  D 1220  OVERALL GOAL OF LIMITING  SPECIAL INTERESTS  <Mr. WALSH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1990
217,House,101,0.208,1286,7,Mr. WALSH.," Mr. Speaker, as we are  all aware, the preamble of our Consti tution begins with the following three  words, ""We the people     .""

""  the  the  We have been charged by our con stituents through their votes, to repre sent their concerns and interests, and  to do the business of this Nation.  However, the American people have  come to believe that special interests  have  replaced  their  interests. That  any  influence  that  they might have  had in the voting booth is lost at polit ical fund raisers.  A former Democratic colleague was  quoted in the book, ""Honest Graft,"" as  saying, with  respect  to  the current  state of campaign  financing,  and  I  quote, ""The process buys you out.""  I am aware of the fact that it takes  more  than a  firm handshake and a  nice smile to mount an effective cam paign. But we must begin the neces sary dialog between the respective par ties to correct the problems affecting  the system.  Effective  campaign  reform must  remove any semblance of impropriety  by those who currently serve, and pro vide  a  competitive  environment  for  those who seek to serve in this body.  I believe the American people want  reform now.

219,House,101,-0.304,1299,7,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in strong support of House Resolution  365 regarding the human rights situa tion  in Cuba. Today,  Fidel Castro  stands alone as  the only dictator  in  Latin America. In a year that has been  marked  by  democratic  openings  around the world,  the Cuban regime  has  clung  to  its  singular  hold  on  power, denying its citizens the right to  change  their government,  to  speak  freely,  to associate  freely,  to  travel  freely-in short, to enjoy basic human  rights.  The resolution focuses particular at tention on the plight of Cuban human  rights monitors who have been arrest ed and detained by the Cuban authori ties. Last April,  five members of the  Cuban Human Rights Party were ar rested for announcing a demonstration  aimed at calling for glasnost in Cuba  during the visit of Soviet leader, Mik hail Gorbachev. According  to  the  State  Department's  human  rights  report, the Human Rights Party lead ers were held  in  incommunicado de tention for 3 days,  tried in a closed  proceeding and convicted of ""illegal  association."" Amnesty  International  has criticized the Cuban Government  for  trying Cuban  citizens  for  the  peaceful expression of their views.  The resolution before us condemns  the Government of Cuba for engaging  in a consistent pattern of gross viola tions  of  internationally-recognized  human  rights  against  the  Cuban  people and deplores the continued sys tematic harassment of Cuban human  rights activists.  I want to commend the sponsor of  the  resolution,  the gentleman  from  New Jersey CMr. SMITH], as well as my  subcommittee chairman,  the gentle man from Pennsylvania [Mr. YATRON],  and my full committee chairman, the  gentleman from Florida CMr. FASCELL]  for  their  continuing  leadership  on  human rights concerns  in Cuba and  around the world.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  I  yield 3 minutes  to  the gentleman  from California [Mr. LAGOMARSINO].  ",1990
220,House,101,0.378,1299,7,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  as an original cosponsor of House Res olution 381,  I want to commend my  colleague and good friend on the For eign Affairs Committee, Mr. CHRISTO PHER SMITH, for his leadership on this  issue.  This resolution condemns  the gov ernment of Fidel Castro for its consist ent  pattern  of  gross  violations  of  human  rights  against  the  Cuban  people.  Those of us who have followed close ly events in Cuba find particularly repugnant Castro's total disregard  for  the protection of civil  liberties and  basic human rights of  those  individ uals who  testified before  the Cuba  working group of  the U.N. Human  Rights Commission.  After the United States finally suc ceeded in getting United Nations ap proval in 1988 for a review of human  rights practices  in Cuba-with Con gressman SMITH playing an influential  role in that effort-the government of  Fidel Castro yielded  to  international  pressure and allowed the U.N. delega tion to go to Cuba. They were prom ised free and unhindered access to the  people of Cuba and were also assured  that those Cubans who presented tes timony  to  the U .N. working group  would not be punished.  The outcome of the U.N. review pro duced little in the way of condemna tion of Castro's human  rights prac tices, but Castro made sure that those  cooperating with  the U.N. working  group were made  to suffer. Many of  those human rights defenders in Cuba  interviewed were  then punished by  Castro with  imprisonment,  harass ment or intimidation.  Although  some  diehard  Castro  apologists refuse  to acknowledge the  historical  pattern of human  rights  abuses and  repression of  the Cuban  people,  one  particularly  telling  ac count of years of torture and punish ment  is  contained  in  the  book  ""Against All Hope"", written by Ar mando Valladares. His book depicting  his 22  years  in Cuban prisons  is  a  scathing indictment of human rights  abuses by the Castro regime. In a way,  it was poetic  justice  that Armando  Valladares was leading the U.S. dele gation  to  the U.N. Commission on  Human Rights when the decision was  taken to investigate Cuba.  Castro's totalitarian regime is virtu ally  isolated  now  that  democratic  changes  are  sweeping  through  the  world. His  efforts  to maintain  his  power and control over the people of  Cuba are reaching ever more desper ate proportions as witnessed by his  feeble attempts with reprisals against  Radio Marti and TV Marti.  It is imperative that we in the Con gress forcefully and convincingly con demn  the orchestrated campaign of  terror carried out by Castro against  those who seek  justice for  those de f ending human rights in Cuba.  I urge my colleagues  to give  their  strong support  to House Resolution  381, condemning Castro and the Gov ernment of Cuba  for human  rights  abuses.  D 1350  ",1990

Res. 508)  designating May 1990 as ""Take Pride  in America Month,"" and ask for its im mediate consideration.  The Clerk read the title of the joint  resolution.  ",1990
222,House,101,0.301,1312,7,Mr. SKEEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in support of House Joint Reso lution 508, a bill which designates the  month of May as Take Pride in Amer ica Month. I appreciate the support of  the gentleman  from California  [Mr.  MILLER]  for his help  in passing this  resolution.  As American citizens we own almost  40-percent of our country. These lands  including  forest, parks, wildlife pre serves,  beaches,  city  parks,  play gounds, and historic monuments are  managed by Federal, State, and local  government agencies.  Although most people take pride in  our la.nds, others act as  if the lands  belong to ""everyone"" and ""no one"" has  the responsibility to care for them.  Unfortunately, many of  these na tional  treasures have been subjected  to  careless misuses  and  deliberate  abuse by visitors to these sites. Some  of the abuses are malicious and bla tantly destructive, like defacing a stat ute in a public park.  Other actions are thoughtless behav ior, such as littering, or plucking flow ers  from  community  flowerbeds.  Either way, the costs are significant.  And sadly, some of the damage is  ir reparable. In fact, more than 80-per cent of  the prehistoric  ruins  in  the  Southwest  have  been  vandalized,  looted or damaged. And the National  Park Service  reports  that vandalism  costs  park  and  recreation  agencies  more than $50 million per year.  As  this Nation  has  grown  and  become more industrialized and urban ized, many people have forgotten or  never learned about how  to care for  the land and leave it better for those  who follow. That is the primary goal  of the ""Take Pride in America"" cam paigna partnership of public and pri vate organizations committed to edu cating our country's citizens on  the  wise use of the resources that belong  to all Americans. The ""Take Pride""  program seeks to promote stewardship  of our public lands, artifacts and his torical monuments.  In every State, volunteers are  in volved in a broad spectrum of grass roots activities including outdoor stew ardship  and  self-policing  programs,  and hotlines to report vandalism, wild life poaching, theft and other destruc tive  ~ctivities. Others help care  for  parks,  highways,  trails,  shorelines,  campsites  and playgrounds  through  cleanup, maintenance and general as sistance when needed.  It is that kind of volunteer support  that ""Take Pride in America"" month  will salute. I'm pleased that a majority  of this distinguished body has taken  this moment to recognize the efforts  of the thousands of volunteers in the  ""Take Pride"" program, by declaring the  month of May  as  ""Take Pride  in  America"" month.  Mr. Speaker, one of the daily news papers in my district, the Alamogordo  Daily News, recently wrote an editori al in support of ""Take Pride in Amer ica"" month, and explained activities of  citizens of Otero County in support of  the ""Take Pride"" program. I include it  for the RECORD.  Americans have been blessed with a  beautiful, abundant  land and a  rich  cultural  heritage.  If future  genera tions are to share in these blessings,  we must take an active role in preserv ing them.  [From the Alamogordo <NM> Daily News,  Mar. 27, 19901  ""IT'S TIME TO TAKE CARE OF TREASURES""  It's no secret that Otero County is rich in  natural treasure. The mountains, forest and  the White Sands make Otero rich in a spe cial way.  Many  congressmen,  including Rep.  Joe  Skeen, are trying to spur Americans to pro tect  the natural  treasure in Otero and  in  the rest of the nation. A joint resolution is  being introduced  in Congress to make the  month of May  ""Take Pride  in America""  month.  ""Americans  have  been  blessed with  a  beautiful, abundant land and a rich cultural  heritage,"" said Skeen. ""If future generations  are to share in these blessings, we must take  an active role in preserving them.""  Many of our national treasures, according  to Skeen, have been subjected  to careless  misuses and deliberate abuse by visitors to  these sites. Some of these abuses are mali cious and blatantly destructive, like defac ing a statue in a public park. Other actions  are thoughtless behavior, such as littering,  or plucking flowers from community flower beds.  Skeen also reminds us that more than 200  incidents  of  archaeological  vandalism  to  U.S. Forest Service land were documented  in 1985 alone. The National Park Service re ports that vandalism costs park and recre ational agencies more than $50 million per  year.  Skeen says ""Take Pride in America"" pro motes a partnership of public and private  organizations committed  to educating our  country's citizens on the wise use of the re sources that belong to all Americans.  Several groups  in Otero are already  in volved in projects to preserve our resources.  ""Take Pride in America"" has the potential  to urge others to get involved in preserving  our national  treasures.  It may also help  remind those careless in the past to be more  responsible with  those  treasures  in  the  future.  ",1990
223,,101,-0.161,1468,7,Mr. DARDEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to bring  to  the attention of my colleagues  the good  work of Camp Sunshine  in Georgia. Camp  Sunshine is a camp for children with cancer,  and  it has served  the youth of Georgia  for  almost a decade. This camp is  like no other.  Camp Sunshine provides an opportunity  for  children with cancer to get away from the ev eryday anxiety and stress that most children,  indeed most adults, will  never know. This  camp  is an experience which  these children  eagerly anticipate each year.  It is a bright ray  or hope in  lives that could easily be clouded  by  the overwhelming realities of the physical  and emotional challenge  to overcome hope lessness.  But Camp Sunshine  is a special place. A  visit  to  this camp would convince you  that  these young campers have a unique appreciaMay 15, 1990  tion of the joy of living. Swimming, horseback  riding, singing, crafts, games, and many other  traditional camp activities are pursued with en thusiasm that can be matched nowhere else.  Other than the summer camp, Camp Sunshine  provides activities throughout the year.  Recently I met with a group of Camp Sun shine kids visiting  the Capitol. These young  people were seeing this great city, as they are  seeing  life  itself, with an attitude of wonder ment and curiosity that is contagious. I eagerly  look forward to the annual visit of Camp Sun shine. This  year's  visitors were: Trent Al dredge, Ryan Bacon, Dee Jay Beck, Bryan  Bridges, David Bryant, Dan Crockett, DeAnna  Drain, Barbara Griffin, Kristin Groom, Holly  Hendrix, Andres  Jimenez, David Kenemer,  John Kimsey, Wendell Long, Marcus Missa vage, Robrico Phillips, Ramon Scott, Karl  Smart, Stephanie Taylor, Fukima Tigner, Molly  Wheatley, Neil White, and Dixie Yandle.  The women and men who make this camp  a  reality are not well known, but  they are  heroes  to  the children and  their  families.  I  commend  the  cochairman  of Camp  Sun shine's board, Dorothy H. Jordan and William  B. Schwartz, Jr., and the entire board of direc tors  as well  as  the  officers: William  B.  Schwartz  Ill, Mary Beth Fain, Mo Thrash,  Thomas Beard, and executive director Sally  Hale.  Mr. Speaker, in closing I want to include the  following  lines  from Camp Sunshine's 1989  publication, Sunny Daze:  Camp Sunshine is a place filled with kind  words,  reassuring hugs and warm smiles.  Where the pain you've known and the con flict you've experienced give you strength to  walk through life facing each new situation  with courage and optimism. A place where  the lives you have touched and those that  have  touched yours are always a part of  you. An experience that leaves you some how better.  PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL  DAY  HON. GEORGE E. BROWN, JR.  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 15, 1990  ",1990
224,,101,-0.506,1468,7,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr. Speaker, May  13  through May 19  is National Police Week  and today is Peace Officers Memorial Day. As  you know, Congress is asked on a daily basis  to approve and promote commemorative days  for any number of  special  reasons. While  many of  the professions and occasions we  are asked to remember are truly worthy of the  honor, it would be hard to find a group more  worthy of note  than  the peace officers who  put their lives on the line every day.  I have  learned first hand how quiet, subur ban communities such as  those  I am privi leged to represent, are being infiltrated by the  violence and destruction of drugs, gangs, and  automatic weapons. One might expect orga nized violence in the large urban cities in our  country, but the drug trade and gang violence  have moved to center stage for most law en forcement officers no matter where  in our  country they work.  ",1990
225,Senate,101,0.466,49,11,Mr. MACK.," There are scholars on  both sides who  indicate that in fact  these artificial barriers do exist and  that each one of them can force up  the cost of housing and as a  result  push millions of families out of the op portunity to afford their own home.  Just as a way of example, earlier this  month we held a conference in Tampa,  FL, on the affordable housing  issue.  One of the individuals who spoke at  that conference shared with us what  was called the affordability profile for  Hillsborough County.  I make two points from it. First, it  showed that if interest rates were to  drop from 10.5 percent to 8.5 percent,  some 31,000 additional families would  be able to afford a home of $68,000 in  value; or at the price of $60,000 an other 54,000 families-not individuals  but families-would be eligible to pur chase that home.  We also  saw  that as  the price of  housing-that is  if you could impact  the housing, if you reduce the cost of  housing by 15 percent, the number of  families eligible, again, would increase  by 32,000.  My point there is that I think each  of us needs to be aware of the fact  that while we may not be addressing  the question  of  affordable  housing  when we are dealing with a series of  other issues, the fact is that what we  have done through interest rates, envi ronmental regulation, building codes,  growth  management,  Davis-Bacon,  have an impact, driving up the cost of  the homes, and around the country we  are  forcing  people  away. We  are  making it almost impossible for them  to own their own home.  The  second  point. There  are  no  stereotypes  living  in public housing.  People living in public housing today  are young and old;  they are black;  they are white; they are educated and  they are uneducated; they are people  who have aspirations and those who  have no aspirations at all. In addition  to  that,  there are people who are  living there because, frankly, they do  not want  to give up. They are not  going  to  allow  the  community  in  which they are living to be taken over  by undesirables.  Meeting Reverend Washington  in  Orlando, again brings  that  to mind.  Reverend Washington was offered the  opportunity to leave this project that  was basically funded because of certifi cates,  project-based  certificates. He  would not leave. I asked him the ques tion, if your church was prepared to  build you  a  home  and move  your  family  from  that project  into your  own home, why would you not leave?  His response was he was not going to  give up. He was not going  to move  away. He was not going to desert the  children who lived in that project. He  felt that strongly.  So again I make the case that there  really  are  no  stereotypes  living  in  public housing. Oliver Hill would be  another example. Oliver Hill up  in  Tallahassee has the potential of being  another Bertha Gilkey  or Kimmy  Gray.  The third point, some issues need to  be revisited. In Jacksonville, FL, at a  meeting with  the  tenants of public  housing,  a  young,  very  large man,  stood up in the back of the room and  in essence pointed a finger at me and  said:  Senator.  the kinds of policies and  the  issues that you all are pursuing up in Wash ington are acting as a disincentive for me to  work as opposed to encouraging me to work.  I said, ""What do you mean by that?""  He said, ""my wife and I went out,  each of us got a part-time  job."" He  said, ""Do you know what happened?  The end result of getting a part-time  job was  that I had fewer dollars  to  take care of my children as a result of  working. What would you do?"" he said.  ""Would you work or would you not?""  There  is  the  issue of whether we  should be requiring people to pay 30  percent of their income toward public  housing. Some make the argument it  should be less than that. Some make  the argument there ought to be some  kind of transition period that would  allow people to accumulate funds so  that  they could move  toward home  ownership.  I  raise  the  issue  about  whether eligibility for public housing  or publicly assisted housing should be  50  percent  of median  income,  or  whether  it should be 80 percent of  median income.  At 80 percent of median income, you  in fact have a different environment  for the people to live in. There is a dif ferent society, if you will. There is an  opportunity for  role models for  the  children. So I  think those are some  issues at which we ought  to  take a  look.  The fourth point that I made was  that we spend too much time on the  issue of bricks and mortar, the idea of  building more  buildings  and  not  enough  time  on  people.  Secretary  Kemp has proposed the idea of Oper ation Bootstrap, which basically says  we should look at the housing and the  problems of housing in a much broad er perspective. We ought to  look at  ",1990

232,House,101,0.691,179,11,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker,  when this Nation began its experiment  in self-government a  little over 200  years ago, there were no questions in  anyone's mind that the foundation of  our society was and is the Judeo-Chris tian ethic. This set of standards or  principles governed our  society and  the decisions  of  the U.S. Supreme  Court for roughly 150 years, and then  in this century a new prophet came  along by the name of John Dewey. He  set out to reform public education in  America by changing the very base on  which it is founded, and he has been  successful beyond his fondest dreams.  He, by the way, was an original signer  of the Humanist Manifesto in 1933. He  brought to this country the philoso phy of moral relativism of secular hu manism.  Mr. Speaker, these two philosophies  are in conflict today in this country.  Our distinguished colleague, the gen tleman from Illinois [Mr. HYDE], has  described this as a cultural war, and  that it is. There is a cultural war going  on in America today between the phi losophy of the Judeo-Christian ethic  and the philosophy of moral relativ ism.  The reason that the proponents of  the philosophy of moral  relativism  have difficulty in bringing themselves  to recognize the existence of a stand ard  in  this case, a standard dealing  with the flag of  the country,  is be cause people who believe that way do   not accept the existence of standards.  The philosophy of moral relativism  says that there is no God in heaven;  God did not create  this world. Any  man at any time can decide for him self or herself what they are going to  do, and they will tolerate no restric tions on their conduct at all.  0 1410  That philosophy is what drove the  decision, in my opinion, of the U.S. Su preme Court by telling us that we do  not have standards in protecting our  flag. That philosophy drove the deci sion in 1962, which said we are going  to take opening day prayer out of the  schools of America. That philosophy  drove the decision in Roe versus Wade  in 1973 that said we are not going to  recognize the right to human life in  America.  Then one of the most ridiculous de cisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in  1981 when we said we will no longer be  able to post the Ten Commandments  on the walls of the public classrooms  of America. That is the philosophy of  moral relativism that is driving  this  debate, and I say there are standards  that exist in our society.  Television commentator Ted Koppel  said  it very well  in addressing  the  graduating class of Duke University:  When Moses  came  down  from Mount  Sinai, he did not bring the Ten Suggestions.  He brought  the Ten Commandments and  the people  that run  the political system  today of this Nation are unwilling to accept  that fact.  I  say  affirm  the  Judeo-Christian  ethic. Affirm the existence of stand ards and vote for this constitutional  amendment.  No person should underestimate the signifi cance of a congressional vote on a constitu tional amendment  to prohibit desecration of  our Nation's premiere symbol of liberty without  license, the United States flag.  Our Supreme Court has ruled a second time  that the Constitution does not permit the Gov ernment to prosecute someone who burns the  flag. Many Americans  feel differently. These  Americans take pride in the heritage and his tory  represented by  the Stars and Stripes.  Many reflect back on  loved ones who gave  their lives for their country. Others new to this  country are grateful for a nation which exists  to provide them refuge  from oppression and  gives them a haven of opportunity.  I,  for one, am deeply disturbed over  the  entire controversy. The fact that the Supreme  Court has even had to consider such a case  is revealing about the cultural morass we find  ourselves in these days.  What a miserable state of existence we find  ourselves in when Congress is perfectly willing  to use Federal tax dollars to fund pornography  and obscenity spewed  forth by  the National  Endowment for the Arts, but we cannot seem  to muster the same enthusiasum  to allow a  community  the  right of self-determination  to  let a child utter a sincere prayer  in public  school to his or her Creator. We seem to care  little about the garbage which bombards our  youth daily. Yet, suggest that some miscreant  not be allowed to burn or desecrate the Amer ican flag and we have a national emergency.  We have had multiple generations raised to  believe that all standards are relative and that  all  liberties are civil and, hence, malleable.  The flag vote is a vote about a standard and  reasonable  limitations  in a  free society. Hu manists, or as Judge Robert Bork calls them  ""moral relativists,"" reject even modest limita tions on  personal conduct so  long as no  person is physically hurt.  We Americans will begin to make progress  on  the war against drugs,  teenage pregnan cies, and crime when we admit to ourselves  that the seriousness of these issues in Amer ica is more of a spiritual problem than one in volving a lack of necessary laws or enforce ment of laws.  Specifically, should we be surprised that the  last generation born in America is having diffi culty in saying no to drugs, which is the ob servance of a standard  in how we  treat our  own body, when as a society we booted the  Creator of standards in human conduct out of  the public education system?  Restoring voluntary prayer  in school  is an  essential step in educating our children on the  existence of standards and values as  the  foundation cornerstone for life.  It is no small thing that a majority of Demo crats  in  the  Judiciary Committee  voted  to  report the flag amendment unfavorably to the  House. They are simply reflecting  the moral  relativism which  infects the leadership of the  Democrat body politic. The Committee voted  18  to 18  to  report  the bill unfavorably-18  Democrats  versus  14 Republicans  and  4  Democrats. They voted 1 7 to 19 to report the  bill  favorably-this  time  three  Democrats  joined the Republicans. And finally, the com mittee voted 19 to 17 to report the bill without  recommendation-five  renegade Democrats  joining the Republicans.  We are a great Nation only when we prop erly weigh our rights against our responsibil ities. Maintaining  the sanctity of our national  symbol is a responsibility we cannot afford to  abdicate. All that is lost in doing so is the  li cense for some ingrate to throw a public tan trum. I believe society can afford such a loss.  ",1990

234,House,101,0.419,192,11,Mr. PACKARD.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of the amendment.  Mr. Speaker, for over 200 years, the Ameri can people have considered a total unaccept able act to burn the flag of our country.  For 200 years, we have considered it a vir tual act of treason  to burn or desecrate the  flag.  But now, we live in a liberal, permissive so ciety that appears willing to allow flag burning.  Virtually every Member of this Congress has  voted to protect the flag. The vast majority of  the American people want to protect the flag.  If the Supreme Court won't do it,  the Con gress and  the States should.  It will do no  harm to the Bill of Rights. Vote for the amend ment.  There are some actions that are unaccept able in our society. Maliciously throwing blood  on this building that symbolizes the bastion of  democracy is an unacceptable act.  ",1990
235,House,101,0.28,192,11,Mr. SCHUETTE.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding this  time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of an  amendment  to  the Constitution  to  prohibit the burning of the American  flag.  The  decision  today  before  this  House is about the stars and stripes,  about the burned and battered, about  the American flag, the national torch  or an emblem of freedom or a flame of  infamy? That is the decision we make  today in an historic way.  The  amendment  is  a  statement  about what is right in America, and  anything less than that says, ""Don't  worry, be happy. It's all right.""  This is a statute. Its day has come  and  gone.  Everyone  knew  that  it  would not fly. It is a charade, it is a  camouflage. So it has disappeared, it  has vamoosed.  There are two points that I would  share with my  colleagues. This  is  about action and conduct, not speech  and expression. We are outlawing and  prohibiting the burning of the Ameri can flag.  The def endent  in  the Texas case  said words to the effect: ""To America,  to the Red, White and Blue, we spit on  you."" We are not prohibiting that. But  we are going to act.  Second, is the Bill of Rights being  trampled  on? No. Before  last year  there were  laws on the books  in 48  States, including Michigan, that pro hibited the burning of the American  flag. Did that kill our right of expres sion? Did it freeze our speech? No. So  we are not impacting on the Bill of  Rights.  What has happened is that a year  ago 5 people in a nation of 200 million  made a decision, and they were wrong.  Was the Court right when they denied  basic  rights  to African-Americans  in  this country? No. Was the Court right  when they treated African-Americans  like property instead of people. No.  When they were wrong, we made a  change. Was  the Court  right when  they denied child labor laws to people  and a humane working environment?  No. We made a change.  The point here  is  that when  the  Court is wrong, as it is here, we must  change it. If we want to stop the burn ing of  the flag, we need an amend ment.  Mr. Speaker,  I  encourage my col leagues  to  vote  for  this  narrowly  drawn,  tightly  crafted  amendment  that restores our decency and what is  right about America.  Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in support of a  constitutional amendment to protect the U.S.  flag from acts of desecration.  I do not do so lightly, or without being abso lutely sure that this amendment is apporpriate  and necessary.  The Stars and Stripes, or  the burned and  battered? The American  flag, or the national  torch? An emblem of freedom, or a flame of  infamy?  That's the  fundamental question  for Amer ica. That's the  fundamental question  for  this  House as we  take part  in  this historic deci sion. The proposed amendment  is a state ment of pride in America, a staple of respect  for our country, our people, our values. Any thing less will send the message: Don't worry,  be happy, everything is OK.  The cover of  the sham,  the charade,  the  camouflage of a Federal statute, which every one knew wouldn't fly, is gone. We are left, as  some of us argued  last year, with voting  to  ensure protection of our flag with a constitu tional amendment, or  to  insist  that our  flag  can be destroyed without punishment.  Two points must be considered:  First, this issue is about action and conduct,  not speech and expression. It was the action  of Joey Johnson, who challenged  the Texas  law prohibiting flag burning,  that we will ban.  It's not his words or his speech that we want  to outlaw. Joey Johnson burned the American  flag, and that's wrong. He also said: ""America,  the red, white, and blue, we spit on you.""  I  find that wrong, repugnant, offensive. But we  are not outlawing his use of those words  in  the form of political protest, as vile as we find  them  to be. We are simply making sure  that  he can never again destroy the American flag  without facing appropriate punishment.  Second, we must consider the Bill of Rights.  Some say we are  trampling on  it with  this  amendment. That's not true. Remember that  only a year ago there were laws in 48 States,  including my home State of Michigan,  that  made it a crime to burn a flag. Did those laws  curtail  our  speech? Did  they  outlaw  Joey  Johnson's speech? No. Did  they destroy our  ability to express political dissent? No.  Have people's values changed since  last  year, values  that hold  it  is wrong  to destroy  the flag and right to punish those who do? No.  What's changed since last year is that our  ability to prohibit flag burning has been taken  away by a decision wrongly made by the Su preme Court. These Justices are people, and  people make mistakes. The Court has been  wrong before.  Was  the Court correct when  it denied  the  rights and guarantees secured by our Consti tution that African-Americans should be treat ed as people, not property? No, of course not.  But that's how our Justices ruled  in the Dred  Scott case. Was  the Court correct when  it  ruled against child labor protections meant to  guarantee a humane and just working environ ment that did not abuse our youth? No. The  Court was wrong  then,  just  like  the Court is  wrong today.  The  question  before  us  is whether we  should  live with  the Court's erroneous deci sion? Should we view the destruction of our  flag as a  right, a privilege, an action  that  simply cannot be stopped? Should we consid er the destruction of our flag, as some have  argued, to be unimportant, a trifle matter that  means little to our society?  No,  today Congress draws a  line. Today,  we'll make history. Today, we'll finally find  it  within ourselves to say enough is enough. We  can protect our  flag without destroying  the  values that is symbolizes; we can protect our  flag and enhance those values.  What  is right and what  is wrong? For too  long we as a nation have allowed  the  lines  that distinguish  right  from wrong  to become  blurred. We have allowed those who claim to  protect our liberty to grossly distort our soci ety's values. We have reached a point where  people worship liberty and totally disregard re sponsibility. We  live  in a time when  there  is  too  little  respect  for people, our  laws, and,  yes, for our flag.  In the decision today, if you want to prohibit  flag burning  in America,  to protect  the  flag  and douse the torch,  to salute the Stars and  Stripes, not  those who burn and batter,  to  honor an emblem of freedom, no a flame of  infamy, you vote for what is right. You vote for  responsible behavior. You vote  for  respect.  You vote for the amendment.  ",1990
236,House,101,-0.357,192,11,Mr. LAFALCE.," Mr. Speaker, almost  2,000 years ago a man was born that  many considered God, and almost 200  years ago a Bill of Rights was born  and freedom of speech was enshrined  ",1990
237,House,101,0.556,218,11,Mr. SHUMWAY.," Mr. Speaker, as a  gross political opportunist,  I  rise  in  strong support of the amendment.  Mr. Speaker,  last year, we enacted a so called content neutral statute to prohibit dese cration of the flag. Since  it was the only op portunity we were offered to express our com mitment to protecting the flag, I supported the  measure,  saying,  ""only  time will  tell  if  this  measure is sufficient.""  Well,  time has  told: The statute did not  stand  the constitutional  test. We now have  three choices. We can pass another simple  statute, knowing  full well  that  it,  too, will be  struck down. We can approve a constitutional  amendment, knowing  full well  that  it  is  the  only effective way  to ban desecration of the  Stars and Stripes. Or we  can do nothing,  knowing full well that such inaction will result  in  further abhorrent destruction of our  fore most symbol. To me, the choice is simple.  I can't speak for all of my colleagues, but  my own constituents have made their collec tive viewpoint clear: protect  the  flag, period.  Since recent history has made it clear that the  mandate can only be met by amending  the  I  support  such  an  strongly  Constitution,  amendment.  Opponents of the amendment process have  painted  a  somewhat  repugnant  picture  of  amendment supporters. We are portrayed as  politically motivated, righteously wrapping our selves in Old Glory to disguise some devious  ulterior motive. That is a specious and offen sive agrument. As I stated earlier, my constitu ents have said ""protect the flag.""  I tried set tling  for  the  statute approach;  the  statute  failed. It is simply a matter of producing an ef fective solution.  Those same opponents also contend  that  amending the Constitution in this manner will  erode the First Amendment, and will open the  door  to all kinds of potential abuses.  I dis agree. There  is no erosion of First Amend ment  rights here. We are simply protecting  one  item,  the  flag,  from one act, physical  desecration.  If amending  the Constitution  in good  faith  were such a dire step, our founding  fathers  would not have provided us with the means to  do so. They were astute enough to make the  Constitution a dynamic document, capable of  adapting to changing times and the accompa nying changing needs. To be  fair,  I sincerely  doubt  that  they ever  imagined an American  citizen would see fit to be disrespectful to the  flag to which he, or she, had sworn allegiance.  And,  frankly,  I sincerely doubt  they would  have viewed  such an act as  ""freedom of  speech.""  Adoption of  this amendment very clearly  puts  the  enforcement mechanism  into  the  hands of the people. First, they can encour age their State legislators to ratify the meas ure. Secondly, they can call upon those same  legislators  to  take appropriate action  to pro tect the flag.  Freedom of expression is a responsibility as  well as a liberty.  It does not include the right  to cause panic by falsely yelling fire in a public  place, nor does it sanction slander or obsceni ty.  In my view, desecration of the American  flag,  for which so many courageous Ameri cans have made sacrifices, is not freedom of  expression.  It  is a  travesty, and  it must be  stopped.  ",1990
238,House,101,0.23,218,11,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in  support of the constitutional amend ment and suggest there is some differ ence between cussing somebody and  hitting them in the mouth while you  are doing  it. That  is  the difference  here.  To me, there is a difference between  saying something abusive about  the  flag, although I would object to that  too, and an act of physical violence.  Burning the flag is not just talk, but a  physical assault. I make the same dis tinction as cussing a person, which is  not punishable, and hitting him in the  face while doing it, which  is punish able.  I feel the Supreme Court could have  made a distinction between an act of  ",1990
239,House,101,-0.319,231,11,Mr. ROSE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in op position to the amendment.  Mr. Speaker, last year marked the bicenten nial anniversary of the greatest event in our  Nation's history:  the estabishment of a  true  democracy  under  the Constitution  of  the  United States of America. As a native of Fay etteville, NC, I look with genuine pride on the  part may State and my home city played  in  this important year. I would like to briefly take  my colleagues back a few years and share a  little of this proud history.  Mr. Speaker, Thomas Jefferson's declara tion of independence was anticipated in North  Carolina  by  nearly  14 months, when  the  Mecklenberg Resolves  and Declaration  of  1775 called for independence from Great Brit ain. The seeds of revolution took root early in  North Carolina, and  that desire  for  freedom  prospered during  the  fight  for independence  and the subsequent birth of our Government.  With good  reason North Carolinians proudly  proclaim our State ""first in freedom.""  The assembly for the First Congress in New  York in March of 1789, and George Washing ton's inaugural in April did not mark the end of  the struggle for independence and a constitu tion;  two States remained outside the Union.  Neither Rhode Island nor North Carolina had  ratified the Constitution.  The previous year, on July 21, 1788, our  ratification convention had assembled at St.  Matthew's Church in Hillsborough, NC. Feder alists  at  the Hillsborough  assembly  urged  speedy ratification, but the Tarheels were not  to be rushed. The convention proceeded with  an article-by-article examination and debate of  the proposed Constitution. Opponents of the  document, argued chiefly that the power and  sovereignty of the States would be imperiled,  and that a Bill of Rights was absolutely neces sary to prevent Federal  infringement on  indi vidual freedoms. It was evident that the major ity at Hillsborough was willing to ask the tough  questions about the future of their new found  freedom. After 1 O days of spirited debate,  North Carolina decided to neither adopt, nor  reject, the Constitution.  Meanwhile, events were moving forward  in  the First Congress. This remarkable body ac complished  perhaps more work  of  lasting  value in less time than almost any of the 100  Congresses which  have  followed. Perhaps  most important of the many achievements of  the First Congress was passage of the Bill of  Rights, which provided the needed impetus for  a  second North Carolina Convention-per haps now it was time for the Tarheel State to  enter the Union. The Assembly convened on  November 2, 1789, and authorized a second  convention, to meet at Fayetteville, NC,  in 2  weeks time. By November 16, 272 delegates  had assembled to consider the Federal Con stitution, and the Bill of Rights. This time, Fed eralists were in a clear majority; after 4 days  ",1990

241,House,101,0.49,257,11,Mr. DORNAN of California.," Madam  Speaker,  I  said  earlier  during  the  debate, because I was only afforded 2  minutes,  and  the  constitutional  amendment  to  protect Old Glory  means a  lot to me. I am 57 years of  age, and as a reporter, a correspond ent, I went to Vietnam 10 times, and I  witnessed the full measure of devotion  that some men gave,  their lives, and  some Army nurses fighting for what  that flag stands for, and I would like  to have had 5 minutes, 10 minutes  during the debate today.  I am not feeling bad about it at all,  because HENRY HYDE spoke every word  from his intellect and his heart that I  wished I could have spoken today. My  wife called me  right afterward and  said our friend, HENRY,  truly walked  into the pages of this Nation's history  today, and that he did.  I would just like to briefly talk about  just one thing that I wanted to men tion on the floor today, and I gave re spect to all those who put all their ef forts  into  trying  to make  the  first  amendment  inviolable,  and who  I  think disregarded the fifth article of  the  original Constitution  of which  James Madison was the father, which  provides  for amending  the Constitu tion by telling a story that happened  on one of my visits to Vietnam.  But before I do that, I want to ex plain why I am not taking the 60 min utes. Last night I was supposed to be  part of an all night session, a series of  1-hour  special  orders  like  this  minu te one I am doing now, to discuss  crime in this country. I had prepared  my hour special order, and I  joined  the effort  late, so  I had  the  tough  watch 3 to 4 a.m.  I was seeing off my son, my daugh ter-in-law, little baby Haley, who is 2  years of age, and my daughter-in-law  is about to deliver in about 2 months  my eighth grandchild, and on the way  back from  the airport my wife said  why did I not stop off at home, have  some dinner, and get a nap. When I  went to sleep, she deliberately turned  off  the alarm, making me  feel  like  Peter,  one  of  the  apostles  at  the  Garden of Gethsemane, because when  I woke up early in the morning I saw  that my colleagues were here, and I  had not answered my watch.  But the unsung heroes of that all  night session on crime worked behind  me here, this excellent staff, the re porters who worked all night long and  all day, and anybody expecting my 60minute special order  tonight,  I had  said I was going to do that not think ing that I had slept on my watch late  last night, and these good folks were  there all night long. So out of respect  for them I will do the 60 minutes on  the flag next week, and just tell this  one story.  5First of all, something shocked me  today. I am not squealing on my fellow  colleagues, but I think Americans out  there should know  this, particularly  young people.  I asked 100 Members,  left, right, Republican, Democrat, lib eral,  conservative, male,  female,  if  they knew what flag or pennant flies  above the United States flag. Not one  single  Congressman  on  this  floor  knew, not one could give me a correct  answer. They could not come up with  an answer at all.  The closest anybody came was Rev.  BILL GRAY, of Pennsylvania. He looked  at me  quizzically  and he  said,  ""A  Christian flag?"" What Christian flag?  But he was close. I told him, ""You are  close, the only one that has had any  inkling at all.""  I  informed all of the pages on my  side of the aisle, and now while they  are attending their high school years  they will know something  that 100  Congressmen do not know on  this  floor, and I  think that I am safe to  assume that what one Democrat told  me is true, that not a Member of this  body knows that the one pennant over  the flag that flies above Old Glory is a  religious flag, but not Christian. It can  be Jewish also. It is a white pennant,  an isosceles triangle, a  long pennant,  and it has on it the cross of Jesus  Christ, the Jewish star of David, and it  flies on ship mastheads and on bases,  Army posts, Air Force posts all around  this world, Marine Corps posts, and it  says, ""The chaplain  is on ship,  reli gious services are taking place on the  base or on the post,  the chaplain is  here,  the  rabbi,  the  chaplain,  the  priest, or the minister.""  Now the reason I know this well is  because I have debated the Nation's  loudest  atheist,  Madalyn Murray  O'Hair, who wants us to either elimi nate  that pennant completely or  to  put it beneath the flag. But it teaches  us a lesson that we do have our prior ities  straight  in  the United States:  God, family, and country.  0 2040  And we are not going to protect by  constitutional amendment ever, what  some Members tried to terrify us with  today,  religious symbols, because we  represent all  sorts of  religions and  they are all protected. What protects  them? This secular symbol behind me,  Old Glory.  Because  in  that  first  amendment that we heard about over  and over again, and  I  have had  it  memorized since I was a school child and it was not the first amendment, it  was originally  the third amendment.  The first two were about pay, and one  of them I wish would have been left  on there. It says no sitting Congress  can vote  itself a pay raise  to begin  until after there has been an interven ing election so  that the people can  judge whether or not the Members in  39-059 0-91-9 (Pt. 11)  ",1990
242,,101,-0.552,270,11,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to introduce the Model Good Samaritan  Food Donation Act.  Its purpose is to provide  States with a comprehensive model  for  re moving one of  the major disincentives  to  those who would donate food and other gro cery products to charities assisting the needy.  Through the efforts of the Second Harvest  National Food Bank Network and similar char ities engaged in feeding the needy, Good Sa maritan  laws have been enacted  in all 50  States which provide limitations on  liability to  those who donate  food. A 1989 study  indi cates that these statutes vary significantly in  the degree of coverage  they provide,  the  types of donors who receive  this protection,  and the types of product donations which are  covered by these laws.  Since many of the companies that are po tential  food and grocery item donors are na tional in scope, standardized liability protection  would result in greater confidence on the part  of  the  industry and more donations being  made available at both the national and local  levels. In order to provide guidance to States  that wish to provide comprehensive, standard ized coverage to those who support the non profit sector's admirable efforts to assist those  in need,  I am proposing enactment of  the  Model Good Samaritan Food Donation Act.  This bill will require no government expendi tures, I believe that it will be an important re source to those charities that are trying to so licit donations of food and other necessities to  support their efforts.  If enacted on  the State  level, especially  in  the many States whose  current good faith donor statutes do not con tain some of the important provisions included  in  this act,  the Model Good Samaritan Food  Donation Act will remove a significant barrier  to private sector support of the nonprofit sec tor's efforts.  The Model Good Samaritan Food Donation  Act has  the support of a wide spectrum of  nonprofit groups,  including  the Second Har vest Network, which  consists of 200  food  banks serving over 39,000 charities, and  the  food and restaurant industries.  Many in the charitable sector rely heavily on  private product donations  to serve  those  in  need. In thousands of communities throughout  the country, the private and nonprofit sectors  have worked together to ease the plight of the  homeless,  the hungry, and others  in need.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  This act will, at no cost to the Federal, State,  or  local governments, assist  their admirable  efforts. I ask you to join me in supporting their  efforts by supporting this act.  THE COMPREHENSIVE LONG TERM CARE INCENTIVE ACT  HON. JOHN J.

244,House,101,0.203,387,11,Mr. GUNDERSON.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by extend ing my thanks and commendation to  the distinguished chairman of our sub committee, the gentleman from Michi gan  [Mr. KILDEEl. When  someone  asked me whether or not I wanted to  manage  this  legislation on the floor  today, I said, absolutely. This is  the  first  time I can remember of that a  Republican bill has come out of the  Committee on Education and Labor.  That is a unique and historic experi ence in and of itself, but more impor tant, I think, it truly is a sign of the  fairness and statesmanship of our col league, the gentleman from Michigan  [Mr. KILDEEl. As the gentleman from  Michigan was  telling me beforehand,  he easily could have  taken this bill,  made it a committee bill, except that  he chose to be fair to the gentleman  from New Jersey [Mr. RINALDO] as the  original author. The gentleman from  New Jersey [Mr. RINALDO] and I both  thank the gentleman for that kind act  of generosity.  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to lead  the effort on the floor today for quick  passage of House Concurrent Resolu tion 333,  legislation  to  express  the  sense  of  Congress  concerning  the  White House Conference on Aging.  In April, I was visited in my office by  Barbara Thoni and Mary Simpson of  the Barron County Office on Aging.  They traveled all the way to Washing ton from Barron, WI, simply  to ex press their support for congressional  action on this issue. I'm very pleased  today to be able not only to make good  on my promise to them to support the  bill, but to go a step further by leading  the floor effort to pass it.  Why is this legislation so important  to  senior  citizens  advocacy  groups?  Why would my constituents travel so  far to express their views on it? Be cause without passage of the bill, the  chance exists that we would miss hold ing  a White House Conference on  Aging for the first time in over four  decades.  The first White House Conference  on Aging was held in 1951, when Presi dent Truman invited groups to Wash ington for discussions on issues of im portance to seniors. Since that time, a  conference has been held once every  10  years,  in  1961,  1971,  and  1981.  These conferences have established a  tradition  of  nonpartisan  dialog  on  issues  affecting  senior citizens. The  conferences involve the full participa tion of individuals, State and local gov ernments, and public and private orga nizations.  Are  the conferences useful?  In a  word-yes. Past conferences a,re cred ited with contributing  to  the enact ment of  the Medicare and Medicaid  Programs, the establishment of a cost of-living-allowance  [COLA]  index for  Social Security beneficiaries, and en actment of the Older Americans Act  which established the Administration  on Aging.  The administration has not  ruled  out holding a White House Conference  on Aging in 1991. Unfortunately how ever,  the administration has not yet  indicated to our seniors that they can  count on such a conference next year.  This  legislation  lends an  important  bridge between concerned seniors and  the administration.  And 194 Members of the Congress  have cosponsored House Concurrent  Resolution 333. While  the President  has the authority to convene a confer ence next year, our bill is a bipartisan  effort to register the strong support of  Congress for the conference. Our sen iors deserve this opportunity. And the  numerous  advocacy  organizations  across  the country-like  the Barron  County Office on Aging in my area are gearing up for this opportunity to  focus efforts on  the aging  into  the  1990's.  Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of  my time to the gentleman from Iowa  [Mr. TAUKE], a member of the subcom mittee, who has worked long and hard  on this and other Older Americans Act  programs.  ",1990
245,House,101,0.27,387,11,Mr. TAUKE.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  my  colleague,  the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin, for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I want to take just a  moment to seize  this opportunity to  focus  some  attention on what  the  agenda might be for the White House  Conference on Aging in 1991.  There are two issues that I think are  critical  that should be addressed  in  that conference that have not been re ceiving  as much  attention  as  they  should. The first is the issue of equity  for older women under the Social Se curity Program. The gentleman from  New Jersey [Mr. HUGHES]  is chairman  of the Committee on Aging and Re tirement Income, of which I am the  ranking member. In that subcommit tee, we have been looking at the ques tion  of  Social  Security  equity  for  women. There is no question but that  during the time when the Social Secu rity Program was put together that we  had a much different kind of structure  in our society than we do  today. At  that  time we  had  the  traditional  family. Father goes  to work, mother  stays at home with the children and  cares for the children.  Obviously, a lot has changed in soci ety  today and we do not have very  many families  that any  longer meet  that traditional framework or that tra ditional model. As  a  result, we  see  many inequities in the Social Security  Program that are particularly harmful  to those women who leave the work  force for a period of time in order to  provide care for children or for sen iors, to those women who are divorced  and to those women who are widowed  at a relatively early age.  In our subcommittee, for example,  we  spent some  time  looking at  the  question of  the dropout years. The  dropout years, as they are called, are  years when a woman would leave the  work  force  in order  to  care  for  a  family, maybe it will be a child, maybe  a spouse, maybe an ill parent.  Now, if a woman has worked for 35  years, but in the midst of that 35 years  maybe took out 7 years to care for an  elderly parent or a child, and there is  another who has also worked 35 years  and they have had identical earnings  records during those 35 years, but the  second one did not take time out to  care for a spouse or family member,  the first woman who did the caring  would  find  that her Social Security  benefits when she  retired would be  much less than the second one. Why?  Because she would have  those zero  years, those dropout years, that would  be averaged in with her earnings over  the previous 35 or the other 35 years,  and  that would mean her  average  annual earnings would decline.  0 1340  Mr. Speaker, we should not so bla tantly penalize people who are put in  a position where they have to care for  individuals. If anything, we should be  encouraging it, not discouraging that  kind of activity. That is an issue that  needs to be addressed.  It seems  to me  the White House  Conference on Aging should spend a  little time focusing on that.  It has been very difficult  to get  public-policy makers to focus on the  issue here in the Congress.  The second issue that I think needs  attention  is  the health care  issue.  I  serve on  the Health Subcommittee,  and we spend a lot of time looking at  the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.  But we are always looking at them in  terms of the annual budget resolution.  We pass a budget resolution, then we  try to adjust the Medicare and Medic aid  Programs  through  the Budget  Reconciliation Act to meet the goals  ",1990

Mr. President, if I could just make a  suggestion  to my  friend  from Dela ware, I hope that the Senator will not  introduce his amendment.  I want to  look at  it.  is  something  that we  should look at next year. Maybe we  can come to some kind of a compro mise next year and pass it through.  I would think that if he would intro duce his amendment now and have a  debate on  it,  then we would be  just  wasting more  time  in a meaningless  fashion in the U.S. Senate.  I would like to suggest to my friend  and colleague from Delaware that at a  minimum-and he will use his own  judgment, as he always has-he print  his  suggested  constitutional  amend ment in the RECORD so that it can be  made a part of the RECORD and then  let us come back,  as we  rationally  should, and visit the matter another  day.  I yield the floor.  ",1990
249,,101,0.275,465,11,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President, we  all know  that the world's forest  re sources, particularly in the tropics, are  fast disappearing. At the recent Inter parliamentary  Conference  on  the  Global Environment, I cochaired the  working group on deforestation and  desertification.  I  said  there, quoting  the Food and Agricultural Organiza tion, that the world was losing 54 acres  of  tropical  fores ts per minute,  that  those acres were being cleared for ag riculture,  grazing,  fuelwood,  human  settlement, for export and for other  purposes, and that those lost trees and  other forest resources were not being  replaced.  Now, just 2 months after our confer ence, I find that I must revise what I  said  there about  the extent of  the  damage to our forests. Unfortunately,  it is even worse than we thought. Ac cording  to  a  recent  report by  the  World  Resources  Institute,  whose  work I rely on a lot for keeping myself  abreast of the world forestry situation,  we are losing our tropical forests at an  average  rate of 85  acres a minute.  That is very depressing.  This  forest  destruction  forever  denies to humankind the benefits de rived  from  species  of  animals  and  plants that disappear in this process,  including  especially  plant  species  which may be essential for improved  food crops, as well as those which may  form the basis for biotechnological ap plication, medicine, and other scientif ic uses.  Land cleared through deforestation  is in many regions unsuitable for ongo ing agriculture and exhausted within a  few years. So cutting down trees in the  tropics often leads  to no permanent  gain, but rather to a cycle of floods,  disruption of hydrological cycles, soil  erosion, and, ultimately,  in some  in stances, desertification.  Very  importantly-and  this  is  the  area in which I am particularly con cerned-deforestation, especially from  burning, also results in significant re lease of carbon dioxide into the atmos phere, thus contributing to the green house effect that causes global warm ing.  The reasons for these forest losses  are, as we know, very complex. They  have to do, in part, with world trade,  international debt, and other macro economic causes. But these losses also  stem from poverty,  from population  growth, from pollution pressures, and  from  inequities  in  land distribution.  These factors lead to precipitate and  usually  counterproductive  landclear ing  for marginal  agriculture.  It is  counterproductive because, after a few  years of crops, the cleared land loses  its nutrients and becomes barren and  useless.  We are talking about lots and lots of  very poor people who have  to work  very hard for their daily bread, and  who, understandably most likely never  heard of biodiversity or global warm ing, and, if they did, would most likely  say they have more important things  to think about.  So what is the right balance between  the  long-term  income of  the whole  ",1990

251,Senate,101,-0.395,491,11,Mr. LEVIN.," Madam  President,  I  thank the Chair.  I  thank my friend  from Delaware.  Madam President, I believe we can  and should protect both the flag and  the first amendment; the flag because  it is a unique symbol of our Nation,  and the first amendment because it is  a unique testament to freedom.  My preference was to have done that  by Federal statute. I believe that such  a statute would have struck the best  balance between  the clear desire of  most Americans to protect the Ameri can flag from burning or other forms  of mutilation, and the clear need to  protect  the  cherished  liberties  for  which it stands.  I had hoped that the Supreme Court  would uphold the statute that I and 60  other Senators voted for in this Cham ber a few months ago. I voted for that  statute because it would have given us  national statute protecting the symbol  of our national unity. It provided for  that protection, and yet had no impact  on the first amendment because the  motive, intent, and purpose of the flag  burning was irrelevant. The action of  the burning was prohibited regardless  of intent or effect.  However, as we all know, that stat ute was recently declared unconstitu tional by a five to four decision of the  Supreme Court. So today the Senate is  faced with a choice: Do we continue to  pursue the protection of the American  flag or, do we say that the Supreme  Court's most recent decision striking  down a statute passed by a majority in  Congress should be the end of our ef forts?  I said before the passage of the stat ute last year, and I still believe, that if  the Supreme Court struck down that  statute, then we should take the next  step of basically authorizing that same  statute by a carefully worded constitu tional amendment.  That is why I am a cosponsor of the  Biden substitute to Senate Joint Reso lution 332, which offers  the Senate  the opportunity to vote on a carefully  constructed, narrowly drawn constituto  the  protect  tional  amendment  American flag.  The Biden substitute does that. I am  afraid  that Senate Joint Resolution  332 does not. But I am not ready to  give up on efforts to protect the Amer ican flag. Neither am I  ready to say  that the only way to cross through a  forest  is  to  fell  every  tree  in  that  forest, when cutting a narrow path  would just as effectively provide pas sage.  I believe we should pass a narrowly  drawn constitutional amendment, the  Biden substitute, one that protects the  flag, while also carrying out our re sponsibilities  to protect  the  liberties  that  it  represents.  I  believe,  as do  many people  I have spoken with  in  Michigan and here, that Senate Joint  Resolution  332  is  not  a  narrowly  drawn  constitutional  amendment  to  protect the flag. Instead of moving us  carefully along a path to protecting  the flag, Senate Joint Resolution 332  will weaken  important safeguards of  the Bill of Rights.  First,  let us  look at  the  face of  Senate Joint Resolution 332.  In  its  preamble  the  resolution  states,  ""Whereas, physical desecration may  include, but is not limited to such acts  as,"" and then it goes on to describe a  number of acts.  Madam President, on its face,  this  resolution does not say ""what you see  is what you get,"" but rather in effect,  it says ""what you see is an inkling, a  taste, of what you might get."" On its  face, Senate Joint Resolution 332 is an  invitation to the Federal Government  and to the States to go broadly beyond  the resolution's own words.  In addition, Senate Joint Resolution  332 states that, ""Physical desecration""  includes ""displaying the flag in a con temptuous manner."" Madam  Presi dent, I agree that there are some ac tions which most people would con clude are examples of ""displaying the  flag in a contemptuous manner,"" but  there are certainly other instances of  displaying the flag which are obvious ly open  to wide  interpretation as  to  whether the manner is contemptuous  or not.  Second,  the  testimomy offered by  the  Justice Department  last  year  before the Senate Judiciary Commit tee  included numerous references  to  the broad flexibility that the Federal  Government and States would have in  enacting  legislation pursuant  to  an  amendment such as Senate Joint Res olution 332.  On August 1, 1989, William Barr, As sistant U.S. Attorney General in the  Office of Legal Counsel, stated the fol lowing on page 13 of his testimony re garding  the Dole-Dixon amendment  which was identical with Senate Joint  Resolution 332:  The amendment would define the frame work within which the legislative authority  of the Congress and the States could be exercised. Within  this  framework, however,  the Congress and  the States would have  wide  latitude  to  prohibit  that  conduct  toward the flag that they believe deserves  proscription.  On page 14, the Assistant Attorney  General said:  While we believe  the amendment would  certainly permit the legislatures to define  ""flag"" in this <narrow) manner, legislatures  would be free to adopt a broader definition,  as Congress itself has done.  On page 17, Mr. Barr stated, ""There  are an  infinite number of  forms of  desecration. I will not attempt even a  representative listing here.""  On page 20 of his testimony, the As sistant Attorney General concluded by  saying,  ""By way  of  summary,  the  Dole-Dixon amendment confers  sub stantial discretion on Congress  and  the States to determine precisely the  degrading acts  toward our flag  that  are to be prohibited.""  Madam President,  ""wide  latitude,""  ""broader  definition,""  ""infinite  number,"" ""substantial discretion,"" are  not words normally used to describe a  narrow  constitutional  amendment.  But those are the very words that the  administration used  last year  in de scribing a constitutional amendment,  which is identical to Senate Joint Res olution 332, which is before us today.  What is particularly ironic is that on  June 21 of this year, in his testimony  before the Judiciary Committee, Mr.  J. Michael Lutting, Acting Assistant  Attorney General of  the Office  of  Legal  Counsel,  stated  that  ""the  amendment is appropriately narrow in  scope."" He also stated that ""Congress  and the States would have to deter mine which types of physical desecra tion  to  for bid. The  range of  their  choice is fairly narrow, because physi cal desecration entails actual contact  with the flag.""  Madam President,  in  less  than 1  year,  the  administration  spokesmen  have shifted  in  their description of  what can be prohibited under  this  amendment from ""infinite number"" to  ""fairly narrow."" The first amendment  has endured for 200 years, and now we  are asked to consider an amendment,  Senate Joint Resolution 332, which  has  traveled at warp  speed,  in  less  than 1 year, from being described by  the administration in terms of being  ""infinite""  to being described by  the  same  administration  as  ""fairly  narrow.''  I find it hard to understand how an  amendment capable of such elastic in terpretations by the same administra tion over such a short period of time  can  be  referred  to  as  ""carefully  drawn.''  One final point, Madam President,  with respect to the testimony offered  on behalf of Senate Joint Resolution  332 by the administration, which high lights its potential for broad interpre tation and application. As Mr. Barr  ",1990
252,Senate,101,-0.241,543,11,Mr. BRYAN.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to congratulate one of Nevada's  most valuable  citizens. Ms.  Pamela  Calhoun, a teacher at Diedrichsen Ele mentary School, has been named our  Nation's 64th Point of Light by Presi dent Bush for her service to the com munity of Sparks and  the State of  Nevada. I want to join with our Presi dent and salute Ms. Calhoun for her  efforts to help make Nevada energy ef ficient and to preserve our State's nat ural beauty.  Mr.  President,  Pamela Calhoun's  outstanding work for energy conserva tion first became known to me 4 years  ago. As a result of her success, I  re quested as Governor, that she teach  other Nevada educators about energy  conservation to help spread the mes sage that each of us can help make  Nevada a more beautiful and energy  efficient State. Ms. Calhoun  seized  that opportunity and as a result, her  efforts have developed into a commu nity based curriculum  that  reaches  many more students than she could  possibly reach on her own.  But the core of her work remains a  group called ''Energy Awareness in the  Northern Nevada Community"" at Die drichsen Elementary School. This or ganization consists of a core of 50 stu dents  in grades K-12, who,  in turn,  mobilize a student population of more  than 600 young people. Students  in  the group work to educate the public  on issues such as pollution, littering,  recycling, conservation and energy al ternatives. They hold community recy cling  and  litter cleanups, distribute  educational fliers about pollution, and  publicize  energy  alternatives. More over, the students do not confine their  efforts to the Sparks community, but  have expanded  to surrounding rural  areas as well. Ms. Calhoun's other ac tivities include working with her fifth  grade science class, and the Science Energy Club  for sixth graders. She  also helps with energy fairs, retreats  and awards ceremonies, such as  the  one today for which she brought her  award winning students to Washing ton.  Mr. President, at a time when we, as  a nation, are finally coming to grips  with a scarcity of both financial and  natural resources, it is increasingly im portant that we harness the energy of  our citizens. The efforts of Ms. Pamela  Calhoun and her students,  together  with  the  support  of  the Washoe  County School District and its super intendent, Dr. Marvin Moss,  have  served to keep Nevada as beautiful and  prosperous as ever. I want to congratu late Ms. Calhoun and all  those who  have helped this cause, for their in valuable work.e  BUMPER CROP OF MARIJUANA  e Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President,  my colleagues well know  that April  showers bring May flowers, but this  spring  in Kentucky  the  rains have  brought much more. For marijuana  growers  in  the eastern part of my  State,  the wet weather has been a  boon for their illegal business.  An article that appeared in the Cou rier-Journal entitled ""Authorities Face  Bumper Crop of Marijuana"" best ex plains  the challenges Kentucky  law  enforcement  officials  face  this  summer. Pot plants, usually measuring  18  inches high  in early June, have  been found to measure in excess of 4  feet. As Trooper Darrell Tolson stated:  ""It's going to be a great year for mari juana. We might even have a bumper  crop.""  I would  like to point out that the  tireless efforts of our law enforcement  agencies and the Civil Air Patrol are  vital to the eradication to this illegal  crop.  Mr. President, I ask that the article  appear in the RECORD for the benefit  of all my colleagues.  The article follows:  [From the Lexington <KY> Herald-Leader,  June 11, 1990)  AUTHORITIES FACE BUMPER CROP OF  MARIJUANA  <By Frank Langfitt)  The war on drugs faces a somewhat larger  opponent  this  summer  in Eastern Ken tucky.  Wet weather in May and early June  is  producing healthier marijuana crops from  Clay to Lawrence counties, said state police,  U.S. Forest Service agents and marijuana  growers.  A farmer in the Crane Creek section of  Clay County says his 600 marijuana plants  are bushier and 4 to 5 inches taller than  usual for this time of year.  ""The wet weather is a blessing,"" said the  unemployed coal miner, who asked that his  name not be used.  Trooper Darrell Tolson, who  is used  to  finding  the  illegal plant 18  inches high  during early June, has found some measur ing 4 and 5 feet tall in Breathitt County.  ""It's going to be a great year for marijua na,"" Tolson said, ""We might even have a  bumper crop.""  Rain fell 22 days in May in the region, for  a total of 5.08 inches-1.56 inches more than  normal, said the National Weather Service  at Jackson in Breathitt County. As of Satur day, 2.56 inches in rain had fallen in June.  Normal accumulation for the month is 3.78  inches.  Rain has lightened the workload for mari juana growers, who often have to carry jugs  of water through the mountains to irrigate  their fields. But for some law enforcement  officials, it has been a headache.  Cloudy weather has grounded airplanes  the U.S. Forest Service uses to spot marijua na fields among the bright, green stands of  hickory walnut and red maple in the Daniel  Boone National Forest.  Agents and their vehicles have had to con tend with muddy mountain  trails, often  leaving tracks that tip off farmers, said Bill  Dixon, a special agent for the Forest Serv ice.  The Forest Service,  the U.S. Drug En forcement Administration state police and  local  sheriffs' offices began cutting and  burning marijuana plants in early May. The  Forest Service has budgeted $300,000 and  plans to use at least 100 people to cut down  the plants during the summer and the fall  harvest seasons.  Leslie and Clay counties' sheriffs' depart ments report cutting at least 1,000 plants  apiece.  The federal state and local task force said  it cut 596,512 plants last year in Kentucky,  one of the five major marijuana producers  in the United States. Only Hawaii and Mis souri exceeded the Bluegrass State in mari juana cut, said John Preston Sutton, chief  of the Cannabis investigation section of the  federal drug agency.  Most of the marijuana cut in the state was  grown  in  and  around  the  660,000-acre  Daniel Boone forest, which runs through 21  Eastern Kentucky counties. It grows more  marijuana plants than any national forest  in the country.  A 10-foot-high plant in Eastern Kentucky  produces  about  a  pound  of marijuana,  which  can  sell wholesale  for  $1,000  to  $1,500, growers said.  About 90 percent of the crop  is sent to  cities in the South and Midwest, said Andy  Sadler, an agent for the Forest Service.  Eastern Kentucky farmers primarily grow  marijuana on the ridges and slopes of the  Cumberland Mountains  to  hide  it  from  police and  thieves.

253,House,101,0.339,569,11,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  My good friend, the gentleman from  Minnesota  [Mr. PENNY]  likes  to de scribe  this amendment as providing  earnest money  toward  the  budget  summit. I would like to put the em phasis on ""earnest."" We in Congress,  indeed, must get serious about the def icit. We are not serious when we use  gimmicks  to make  the deficit  seem  smaller, and we are not serious when  we move ahead in adopting spending  bills without  authorization  behind  them. We are not serious when we all  admit that the deficit must come down  by at least $50 billion this year, and  yet we keep increasing spending.  How much does this bill raise? Well,  let Members take a close look at some  of those numbers. In the Commerce  Department, the only authorized pro gram that would have reduced spend ing in this bill is the Census Bureau.  That  is not because  the committee  really tried to save any money, it is be cause the Census is over, and there is  nothing to spend the money on, 1991.  All the other authorized programs in  Commerce  increased,  some by more  than 20 percent. Surely we can do  better at saving money here. In the ju diciary,  the only savings  that  I can  identify is a $1.4 million reduction in  judicial retirement fund. All other pro grams increased, and the total increase  is 15.8 percent. We can do better. The  Department of Justice has a 40.9-per cent increase. I fully endorse providing  the Justice Department with the re sources needed to do its work, particu larly with the S&L which is one of the  reasons that the gentleman from Min nesota exempted that department or  that category. But can we really justi fy that large an increase when we are  facing a deficit crisis?  When we do these kinds of things,  how  can we  expect  the American  people to take Congress seriously in its  efforts to reduce the deficit. Surely we  can reduce the spending in this bill by  2 percent. It is, as my friend the gen tleman from Minnesota says, a modest  but earnest amount. It is a figure that  will say to our constituents and to all  persons and to the budget summiteers  that we are, indeed, serious about re ducing the deficit. I do not want to see  taxes raised. A 2-percent reduction ex empting S&L is the best that we can  do, and the least that we can do.  ",1990
254,House,101,0.332,569,11,Mr. ROGERS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the amendment.  I hope not to take the full time, but  let me say  this.  I will be voting for  some of these 2-percent cuts, on some  of the bills where it is over last year's  amount, or where it is over the Presi dent's request. Neither one of  those  apply to this bill.  This subcommittee has already cut  enough from this bill to where we cut  the President's request. We are below  what the President requested. We are  below what last year's spending level  was. We are below the Congressional  Budget Office numbers, the CBO base line. We are below all of those, even on  the amounts that are appropriated in  the bill.  Now, Members are going to get their  chance later this year to make a great  big killing  in all  the bills when  the  Senate conference comes back with a  big ""whack"" and Members will have a  lot of funds if they like cuts later this  year. But please do not cut the work  of a  subcommittee who has already  done the cutting. Frankly, cutting on  things  that I would not  like  to cut  anyway-the Justice Department, the  war on drugs, and the savings and loan  prosecutions, and the Commerce De partment, that tries to sell American  goods overseas. Please do not cut this  bill. There will be plenty of opportuni ties later on.  Now, as the chairman has indicated,  to the extent that the Marshal Service  is  involved  in  the savings and  loan  prosecution effort, we are cutting the  savings and  loan prosecutions here.  Make no mistake about it, if Members  want  to go back home and defend  themselves on it, go ahead and cut this  amount of money from  the prosecu tion of savings and loan criminals. No  2,  if Members want to go home and  def end themselves on cutting moneys  from  the  drug war,  vote  for  this  amendment, because that is precisely  what Members are doing. Members are  cutting $8 million  from where  the  money needs to go, and that is to the  local  communities,  to  your  police  force,  and  to your  sheriff's depart ments. These State and  local drug  grants will  cut  $8 million  by  this  amendment. So Members are cutting  the drug war. Members are cutting  international trade promotion because  the  International Trade Administra tion,  carrying America's  trade war  overseas, will be cut by  this amend ment. Members will be cutting weath er service, cutting the U.S.  Informa tion Agency, sending America's mes sage of freedom around the world.  We will have a chance to vote for  cuts later on. Please do not cut the  programs that mean so much to Mem bers and their constituents in America  at this moment.  D 1420  ",1990
255,House,101,0.446,569,11,Mr. THOMAS of Wyoming.," Mr.  Chairman, I move to strike the requi site number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of the amendment.  I will speak very briefly, and I do not  rise to talk about the details but only  to suggest, as do other Members, that  I go home every weekend and I talk to  people about spending, and they say  that we need to be responsible, they  say we need to slow down our spend ing, and they say we need to cut our  spending.  We find ourselves here surrounded  by agencies that, of course, never have  enough money and never will. But our  job  is  that of selecting alternatives.  There is not one of us in our families  or in our businesses who cannot adjust  to a 2-percent cut.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  commend  this  amendment  to my colleagues, and I  support it strongly.  ",1990

257,House,101,-0.051,569,11,Mr. PENNY.," The amendment would make a 2  percent across-the-board cut in the discretion ary accounts  in  the Commerce-State-Justice  appropriations bill (H.R. 5021 ).  With more  than  a  $160  billion  Federal  budget deficit for this fiscal year, we  in Con gress  should  relish  the opportunity  to  trim  these  spending bills  in a  fair and prudent  manner. The 2-percent cut would achieve sav ings of approximately $200 million. While this  may seem  like peanuts compared  to the bil lions of dollars appropriated every year,  it  is  one step in the right direction.  Remember  that we have  to be held ac countable for our actions. And quite frankly,  I  do not want to be left carrying the water for all  the spendaholics who refuse to face the cold  hard facts that the House overspends. Every  appropriation bill can stand this modest cut.  It's time to put up or shut up.  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Penny Upton amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment offered by the gentle man from Minnesota [Mr. PENNY].  ",1990
258,House,101,0.238,582,11,Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska.," Mr. Chair man, the amendment in the nature of  a substitute that I am now offering to  S. 280 fixes a bad, irresponsible bill.  My amendment conforms with cur rent law by providing for a usual and  customary study, pursuant to sections  5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act,  of the entire length of the Niobrara  River  included in the 1982 National  Park Service ""Nationwide Rivers In ventory.""  My amendment  is environmentally  sound and  logical.  It proposes  that  253-miles,  not  just  an  arbitrarily  named 76 miles, of the unique Nio brara River be studied for designation  in the Wild and Scenic Rivers System.  In  addition,  because  5<a>  studies  have most often failed to answer all of  the questions surrounding a potential  designation, especially in cases like the  Niobrara where a majority of private  land is involved, my amendment also  provides for a  thorough management  plan to be formulated for the area.  The  administration  supports  this  amendment. Interior Secretary Lujan  and OMB Director Darman will rec ommend that S. 280 be vetoed should  this amendment fail today.  This  is  not  just  another  simple  scenic river designation. Because the  land along the Niobrara River is ex tensively privately owned, it is a prece dent-setting piece of legislation.  My amendment is supported by an  overwhelming majority of Nebraskans.  In a statewide poll conducted June 1112, 1990, 63 percent favored studying  the river, as I propose, before designa tion. Only 27 percent favored instant  designation  and  immediate Federal  intervention.  As I do, the majority of Nebraskans  want to be sure that the Department  of  the  Interior,  the  agency  to  be  charged with managing the river as a  national component, has the informa tion it needs to effectively and correct ly  administer  the  river or portions  thereof as components of the national  system.  My amendment gives  the National  Park Service 30 months to complete a  comprehensive,  formal,  and  useful  study of  the Niobrara River. The  agency said in testimony and consulta tions that it recommends, and I quote  from a April 5, 1989, Senate hearing,  ""two to three complete fiscal years"" to  conduct the normal suitability study  set forth in the law.  If my study amendment is enacted, I  fully expect that 30 months from now,  we will be designating parts of  the  Niobrara River as components of the  Wild and Scenic Rivers System.  But my amendment provides mecha nisms for making sure the concerns of  all will have been appropriately ad dressed in a carefully developed man agement plan.  The  study  provided  for  in my  amendment also may determine that  portions of the river are so ecologically  fragile that they should be designated  as wild, a designation that would in volve more restrictions and protections  than a scenic label.  A study may determine  that some  segments should be designated as rec reational,  a  designation  that would  entail less restrictions and protections  than a scenic label.  The bottom line is that a study must  be performed to determine which seg ments of the river need formal protec tion, how best  to protect  those seg ments, and who-local, State, or Fed eral Government-should be responsi ble  for managing and  implementing  the protection plan.  In my  statement  during  general  debate, I offered the hard, indisputa ble evidence-the Niobrara River has  not  been  studied  for  the  purpose  before us today. But let me repeat to  drive this important point.  Quoting from a Department of the  Interior  letter written  earlier  this  month: ""Out of the 108 rivers desig nated by Congress since 1968 as com ponents  of  the National Wild  and  Scenic Rivers System, none has been  designated without  some  form  of  study by the National Park Service,  Forest Service, Bureau of Land Man agement, or other agency. The Nio brara has had no formal study whatso ever.""  I want to point out for my colleagues  that this is not the identical amend ment offered and defeated  in both  subcommittee  and  full  committee  markups. I have made minor, but sig nificant improvements.  Most significantly, I have changed  the amendment  to meet  the charge  that  it  contained  a  loophole  that  would allow for the Norden Dam to be  constructed along the Niobrara River  in the future.  The Norden Dam  is  a  long-dead  project being used by proponents of  immediate designation  as  a  smoke screen to detract from the issue and  provide a tenuous and irrelevant argu ment to further their position.  Although this is not a debate about  the Norden Dam, I have made every  effort to address the concerns of my  colleagues.  I urge support for my amendment.  Everyone agrees the river should be  protected;  that  is  not  the  debate  before us today.  This is a crucial procedural debate  about  fairness and conforming with  current  law, which my  amendment  does.  The Niobrara River  is not  threat ened by any immediate or near-term  development or adverse uses. We have  time to follow the law we enacted and  do this the right way.  Let me close by summarizing why  you should vote yes on this amend ment:  Vote ""yes"" for expert study before  ""instant"" Federal designation.  Vote ""yes"" for studying 253 miles of  a beautiful river-not just blindly des ignating 76 miles.  Vote ""yes""  to do  the  job we were  sent here  to do-represent our con stituents-and  to  save your district  from the political steamroller driving  this bill.  Vote  ""yes"" on  ment.  the Smith amend D 1600  ",1990
259,House,101,-0.472,582,11,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the Smith amendment.  This amendment is designed to once  again postpone and def eat the protec tion and designation of the Niobrara  River. Not  content with  trying  to  eliminate the 76-mile scenic designa tion of  the Niobrara, Mrs. SMITH'S  amendment would strike all the provi sions of the bill, including those unre lated to the 76-mile designation.  Opponents of designating the Nio brara Scenic River have taken to call ing this ""instant"" designation. Well, 25  years is anything but instant and that  is exactly how far back proposals to  designate the Niobrara River go. The  gentlewoman would have us believe  designation just came up and is now  suddenly being thrust upon the area.  The fact of the matter is Federal and  State agencies have  inventoried and  studied this river for many years and  reported on its outstanding resource  values.  ",1990
260,,101,-0.218,660,11,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Speaker,  this country re cently  lost one of  its great civic  leaders-a  pillar of the civic community of the cities of  Austin and Dallas and the State of Texas, and  an outstanding spokesman  for our disabled  veterans-William O'Brien Cooper, known  to  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  those close to him as ""Bill."" He died recently  in Paris, France, at the age of 81.  In recent years, Bill Cooper lived in my dis trict in Austin, TX, and he was just as active  and effective a  leader as he was  in earlier  years with the Dallas and Texas Junior Cham bers of Commerce, when he served as presi dent of each group. He  loved to take part in  youth projects,  like  the establishment of a  summer camp for predelinquent boys.  Bill's service to his Nation began, like many  young men of his day,  immediately after the  attack on Pearl Harbor. Bill enlisted  in  the  Tank Corps of the U.S. Army, serving with the  12th Armored Division from 1942 to 1946. His  service earned him the Bronze Star, France's  Medal of Liberation, and numerous World War  II campaign medals.  When the war ended, Bill became interest ed in the needs and problems of war veterans  and their dependants. He provided great as sistance to World War II vets through his work  with  the Federal Government  in  veterans,  housing, and reemployment programs, serving  in the Southwestern States of Arkansas, Lou isiana, Oklahoma,  and Texas  for 4  years  before entering private business.  Through his business career, Bill continued  to work on behalf of veterans, especially the  disabled. He held positions of  leadership at  the local, State, and national levels in the Dis abled American Veterans, becoming  its na tional commander in 1960. Under his leader ship, new emphasis was placed on broaden ing the range of services available to disabled  veterans and  their dependants. Through  the  efforts of Bill's administration, the DAV veter ans service grew to be one of the most out standing programs of its kind in the Nation.  The past national adjutant general of  the  Disabled  American  Veterans,  Denvel  D.  Adams, credited Bill Cooper not only with the  organization's success but  it's very survival.  ""Bill was one of the generals that led the DAV  out of  the  throws of bankruptcy"" when  the  DAV was on the brink of financial ruin, Adams  said. Upon  learning of Bill's death, past na tional commander Billy Kirby described Bill as  ""a man who was everything the DAV stands  for, a true gentleman. He never once sought  to get anything out of  the DAV. He only  sought  to give what he could give, how he  could best serve his fellow man.""  Following his tenure as national commander  of the DAV, Bill was chosen by the U.S. De partment of State to become the Director of  the Agency  for  International Development  to  the Sudan, a position he held until 1967. For  his efforts with the Agency, Bill was honored  by the Sudanese on numerous occasions for  his personal contributions to the economic de velopment of the country.  Bill continued his lifelong work on behalf of  veterans and  earned worldwide  recognition  while  serving as Secretary General of  the  World  Veterans  Federation  from  1967  to  1976. The Federation includes associations of  war veterans,  former  resistance  fighters, de portees, prisoners of war, and war victims  from 49 countries on 5 continents. Under Bill's  leadership, the Federation worked to promote  the interests of all people disabled by war.  For his important contributions as WVF Sec retary General, Bill was  inducted  into  the  Order of Orange-Nassau, one of the highest  June 26, 1990  honors  the country of  the Netherlands can  bestow. During Bill's induction into the Order,  the Dutch Secretary of State for Foreign Af fairs described Bill as ""a man who not only  advocated but translated into his daily life the  principles of freedom, peace, and human dig nity.""  Mr. Speaker, from a personal standpoint, I  have lost a dear and  loyal friend. Bill Cooper  and I were not only good friends when it came  to veterans matters, we were close personal  friends.  For  the  last 15 years or so, Bill  lived  in  Austin and was active in civic and political af fairs. He never let up on his activities, carrying  on with the vigor of a much younger man and  remaining extraordinarily  loyal  to his  friends  and his causes. Somehow you knew that Bill  Cooper would always be  there  to do some thing  for you or  for a good cause-not just  waiting  to be asked, but  taking  the  initiative  ahead of time.  Mr. Speaker, Bill Cooper's death is an ines timable  loss  to veterans  in  this country and  around the world. I have visited his family: his  wife Lucille of Austin, TX, his son, Don, and  daughter-in-law, Eva, of Alexandria, VA, and  two grandchildren, Paul and Stephanie.  I feel  a very personal  loss with the passing of this  remarkable, warm and kind man.  BUSH  ADMINISTRATION  FUSES  TO  ENFORCE  APARTHEID SANCTIONS  RE ANTIHON.

In other words, we  are  the only Nation on Earth  that  makes its people choose between their  families and  their  jobs. During  the  past 25 years, the American work force  has  changed dramatically,  and  this  has wrought an immense burden on  our families. Two-thirds of mothers of  children under the age of three work  outside the home-in a nation where  affordable, dependable child care  is  extremely difficult to find. In the tra dition of legislation like the minimum  wage, Social Security, and health and  safety  regulations,  the Family  and  Medical Leave Act addresses an urgent  social need-the need for our society  to  recognize  that  its  citizens  are  people, as well as workers.  In addition, the bill strikes a balance  between  the needs of business and  those of working  families.  It allows  workers to take 12 weeks off-without  pay-for family or medical emergen cies, yet  it permits employers  to re place workers who have not returned  after  those  12 weeks.  In  a  nation  which prides itself in its family values,  surely we can permit our citizens to be  with their loved ones during times of  illness, with  their  children  in  the  formative months after childbirth.  I sincerely hope that the President  will sign this family bill into law.

I certainly rise  in strong sup port.  The conflict that has wrecked the  country of Lebanon for 15 years now  has affected not only Americans of  Lebanese descent, as the gentlewoman  from Ohio  and myself,  but many  Americans. We know that the people  of Lebanon do want peace. They are  not the ones responsible for the taking  of American hostages or any hostages  in that country. Indeed the people of  Lebanon are being held hostage them selves to outside powers that only fuel  the flames of fighting in that country  for their own selfish purposes.  The gentlewoman stressed very well  that this $7.5 million goes to private  to any  voluntary organizations, not  militia leaders.  The  gentlewoman mentioned  the  trip to Lebanon that she took late last  year, which I had the honor to  join  her. At that time we were able to see  that the devastation has not only af fected the western Moslem section of  Beirut but now is affecting the eastern  Christian sectors of Beirut as well.  The devastation  in  the Christian  sector, for example, has been worse in  the last 3 or 4 months than in perhaps  the last 15 years of fighting in that  country.  So this is money desperately needed  by the people of Lebanon, the people  that  love  the American people,  the  people that love our country, want to  be our friends.  This is only a pittance, I believe, of  what we can do  in return for  their  friendship, for our desire to seek peace  in the country,  to see the territorial  sovereignty of Lebanon and the recog nition of all  the boundaries of  the  countries  in  the  region,  to  live  in  peace, free from continued devastation  and human suffering.

269,House,101,-0.429,738,11,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself 5 minutes.  Mr.  Chairman,  my  amendment,  whch is offered together with the gen tleman  from Michigan  [Mr. BROOM FIELD],  is designed to permit the pro gram of nonlethal assistance  to  the  non-Communist  resistance  forces  whom we have supported for many  years in Cambodia to continue, while  simultaneously prohibiting any assist ance  directly  or  indirectly  to  the  Khmer Rouge.  The amendment would strike a pro vision  in  the  bill  before Members  which would prohibit any and all as sistance, even nonlethal assistance, to  the non-Communist resistance forces  in Cambodia. Mr. Chairman, I  think  we have three main objectives which  we need to consider in Cambodia. The  first  is  to prevent Pol Pot and  the  Khmer  Rouge  from  returning  to  power. The  second  is  to bring  the  fighting  in  that country  to an end.  The third is to make it possible for the  people of Cambodia, at long last,  to  have the opportunity for self-determi nation.  Mr. Chairman, I will submit that the  provision in the bill which completely  prohibits any assistance whatsoever to  the non-Communist resistance forces  would strike a deadly blow against our  efforts to prevent the Khmer Rouge  from returning to power,  to make a  free and fair election possible, and to  bring the fight in Cambodia to an end.  Indeed,  I would suggest  that  if our  amendment  is defeated and the lan guage in the bill is preserved, it would  play  right  into  the  hands  of  the  Khmer Rouge. It would play into the  hands of the Khmer Rouge by greatly  diminishing the prospects for a politi cal settlement of the Cambodian con flict which would bring the fighting to  an end, which would facilitate the in troduction of a  large United Nations  peacekeeping force, and which would  make possible an  internationally su pervised free and fair election.  In a free and fair election, Pol Pot  and the Khmer Rouge would have no  chance whatsoever. The anti-Khmer  Rouge elements in Cambodia will not  need Roger Ailes  to make negative  spots  in order  to def eat the Khmer  Rouge  in  an  election. However,  if  there is no political settlement and the  fighting continues, then Pol Pot and  the Khmer Rouge, who have 40,000  men still under arms and constitute  the most formidable and fanatical of  the various Cambodian factions in the  field, could very easily battle their way  back to power in Phnom Penh over  the next few years.  The reason that the defeat of this  amendment and the adoption of the  language  in  the bill would diminish  the prospects  for  a  political  settle ment, thereby playing into the hands  of Pol Pot, is that it would greatly di minish  the  incentive which Vietnam  has to agree to a political settlement.  We are now closer to achieving a polit ical settlement of the Cambodian con flict than at any time in the last 15  years. The five permanent members of  the Security Council are essentially in  agreement on how to do it, by bringing  in the United Nations, and by having  an internationally supervised free and  fair election. China is behind it, the  Soviet Union is behind it, the United  States is behind it, but Vietnam and  the puppet government in Cambodia  are not. If we now abandon the non Communists, we will  be  sending  a  signal to the Vietnamese that time is  on their side, and their incentive  to  make the concessions necessary to get  a  settlement will  be greatly dimin ished.  Now, it will be said by the opponents  of my amendment  that  the aid we  have given to the non-Communists in  the past had ended up in the hands of  the Khmer Rouge. That is simply not  true. I have looked into it. I have had  closed briefings on it, and there is not  a shred of credible evidence that any  of our aid to the non-Communists in  the past has ended up in the hands of  the Khmer Rouge. If it were true, I  would be leading the fight to cut off  this aid to the non-Communists, but it  is not true. It will also be said by oppo nents of my amendment that Prince  Sihanouk, who we are trying to help,  is a front man for the Khmer Rouge.  This  is hogwash. The best evidence  that it is hogwash is the fact that 1  month ago the Japanese convened a  conference  in Tokyo  to move  the  peace process on Cambodia forward.  All  the  Cambodian  factions  were  present, and at the end of the confer ence they had a communique calling  for a cease-fire and a political settle ment. Hun Sen signed  it, Sihanouk  signed it, Son Sanr signed it, but the  Khmer Rouge did not sign it. If Sihan ouk  is  a  front man  to  the Khmer  Rouge, why would he be signing agree ments opposed by the Khmer Rouge  and which exclude the Khmer Rouge  from power?  I urge Members, as does the adminis tration, as do all of the ASEAN ambas sadors, to support my amendment and  prevent  the Khmer Rouge from  re turning to power.  ",1990

275,Senate,101,0.261,816,11,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I  rise  in strong support of  the Cranston D' Amato substitute amendment to S.  566, the National Affordable Housing  Act.  First of all, I want to commend HUD  Secretary Kemp, Senator CRANSTON,  Senator D' AMATO, Senator MACK, and  others for working out a compromise  that,  if enacted, will  truly empower  the poor, create a ladder of opportuni ty out of poverty and bring the dream  of homeownership closer to all Ameri cans.  This agreement represents a dramat ic shift in the policies and priorities of  the original committee-reported hous ing bill. The agreement emphasizes  empowerment strategies that help the  poor over housing production. It pro vides more  flexibility  for State and  local governments to meet low-income  housing needs. And finally this legisla tion  includes  reforms  that will put  FHA back on the road to solvency.  I would also like to commend the ne gotiators  for  including most of  the  changes that I had suggested in my  proposed amendments.  One of my chief reservations about  S. 566 was that it did not target assist ance to the very poor. Only one-quar ter of the proposed HOP Block Grant  Program would be  targeted  to  the  worst-case  families-those with  in comes of less than 25 percent of an  area's median income. At a time when  these worst-case housing needs will  grow to 4.5 million by 1995, we must  target  scarce housing  funds  to  the  truly needy.  My amendment would have required  that 100 percent of HOP funds be used  for  the  benefit  of  very-low-income  families-those with incomes below 50  percent of an area median income and that families be selected for HOP  assistance on the basis of current pref erence  rules  for  low-income housing  programs. The  compromise  amend ment would target 90 percent of HOP  funds to very low-income families.  I am also pleased that the compro mise package restores the vital compo nents  of  the President's Operation  Bootstrap Program. Operation Boot strap  is  an attempt  to  apply  new  thinking  to America's housing prob lems. Under this program, public hous ing authorities would be required to  link vouchers and supportive services.  The recipients of housing aid will si multaneously be provided with  the  services they need in order to achieve  upward mobility-services  like  job  training, child care, and  transporta tion.  Operation Bootstrap  is a wholistic  approach to moving the poor toward  self-sufficiency. It is built on the basis  premise that Government assistance is  a two-way street: If the taxpayers pro vide  them housing assistance,  recipi ents should do everything they can to  achieve self-sufficiency and  join  the  economic mainstream.  Under  the  compromise, Operation  Bootstrap would be available  to all  PHA's, and it would be mandatory for  families with members  capable  of  working.  I  believe  that  low-income  families have an obligation  to work  ",1990

I  look at the State of my distinguished  friend from Illinois, and I can remem ber Continental-Illinois Bank  going  bankrupt.

We are going to  step in not just to save the depositors,  but to save the shareholders of that  bank.''  I agree with that; I thought that is  what we should have done. I support ed that. But then I watched the banks  in Texas get in trouble, eventually. I  watched  the biggest holding compa nies in the State of Texas getting in  serious  trouble.  I  saw  families  that  spent  their  lives,  and  their  fathers  before  them,  in  the banking institu tion. They were conservative bankers,  and I watched them go broke. The reg",1990

279,Senate,101,-0.276,881,11,Mr. REID.," Many States, particularly  those in the Sun Belt, have large per centages of citizens living in manufac tured housing. Specifically,  they live  in housing  that before  1976 would  have been referred to as mobilehomes.  Some 26 percent of those in manufac tured homes are  retired, 29 percent  hold blue collar jobs, 23 percent have  income less than $10,000 and 35 per cent have income between $10,000 and  $19,999. In my State of Nevada, fully  18 percent of the population is housed  in mobilehomes. The numbers  are  similar  throughout  the South  and  Southwest. In Arizona it is 9.3 percent  and in Florida 16 percent. These sta tistics indicate mobilehomes are an at tractive housing alternative  for mil lions of Americans particularly those  of modest income.  Since  1980, manufactured  homes  have accounted for 14.2 percent of new  housing production and 29.4 percent  of all new single-family homes sold.  Approximately 10 percent of all Amer icans now live in mobilehomes. Under  existing law, mobilehome residents of  low-and very low-income who qualify  for section 8 rental assistance may use  the  benefits  for  both  homes  and  spaces, popularly known  as  ""pads.""  Despite  this authorization,  the pro gram is not working as intended.  In Nevada,  fair market  rents are  often set too low to assist with space  rentals. HUD  inflexibility on the es tablishment of fair market rents for  space rents has prevented section 8 as sistance  from  benefiting  a  large  number of otherwise qualified  low income individuals. Yet I believe the  National Affordable Housing Act con tains  one  possible  solution  to  this  problem.  Section 52l<b)(2) of the bill permits  the establishment of alternative fair  market  rent  schedules  that  reflect  rent variations within a market area. I  ask that,  in conference,  the Senator  from California make  explicit  that  such alternative schedules could  re flect  the actual cost of mobilehome  space rents within the market area of  a public housing agency.

I  just cannot comprehend how we can sit here  in Congress and authorize one pork barrel  project after another, and  then  turn around  and  tell  the American people  that we must  raise their taxes!  One example of unthinking runaway spend ing occurred recently when the Education and  Labor Committee authorized $12 million for a  new building for the Washington Center, which  offers  internships and academic seminars  to  college students.  I am pleased to report that  some of us in the House were able to at least  stall that effort last week.  Obviously,  in certain cases, sponsoring an  intern  is  justified. However,  this  particular  project demonstrates the blindness with which  some of my colleagues choose to spend the  taxpayers' money.  In effect, the aurhorization  would allow for the building of a private uni versity. Furthermore,  the belief  that  it would  aid  underprivileged  students  is  unfounded:  Only about  16  percent of  these  students  would receive scholarship funds. At a time of  huge budget deficits, we have no business  spending $122 million in this manner.  Such a lack of responsible spending has to  end, now! Those participating in the so-called  ""budget summit"" need  to be  reminded  that  there is far too much existing waste to justify  any new taxes!

282,,101,0.552,1024,11,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay tribute to a true American  for his valiant  efforts  for his  country and his  friends. Ed  Ramon, a Shoshone-Comanche  Indian resid ing  in my district, earned 42 military decora tions during his two tours in Vietnam as heli copter pilot. One has to ask why a man would  go back for a second tour in Vietnam. ""It was  because my buddies were still  there  fighting  and dying,'' he  told me.  ""I  thought  I could  make a difference,'' said Ramon.  To the many young men who he evacuated,  Ed Ramon did make  the difference-the dif ference between  life and death-the biggest  difference in the whole world.  Like so many soldiers returning  from Viet nam, Ed found a new perspective on life. Do mestic problems, dealing with his memories of  Vietnam,  and  his brother's suicide due  to  postwar depression instilled the desire to pub lish an anthology of poems about his experi ences.  His collection, entitled  ""Scars and Stripes  Forever,'' has the ability to provide strength to  many veterans who have found themselves in  this same postwar situation.  I applaud Ed  for all  the work he has done  for his country and for his fellow soldiers. On  May 30, 1990, at Driller's Park in Tulsa, OK, I  will have the honor of presenting Ed Ramon  with many of his decorations earned  in Viet nam. I am proud to be acquainted with a true  American like Ed Ramon.  s. 2615  HON. HARLEY 0. STAGGERS, JR.  OF WEST VIRGINIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 27, 1990  Mr. ST AGGERS. Mr.  Speaker,  today,  I,  along with DOUG APPLEGATE, DON EDWARDS,  LANE EVANS, CLAUDE HARRIS, GEORGE HOCH BRUECKNER, L.F. PAYNE, and JOHN ROWLAND,  all members of  the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee, have  introduced  legislation  that  would allow veterans alleged to owe debts to  the Department of Veterans Affairs to be per mitted the same right that nearly every other  American  citizen  enjoys  in  debt  collection  cases,  to employ counsel  to  represent and  defend against what, in some cases, is an im proper allegation of debt and unwarranted  debt collection efforts.  In April,  the Housing and Memorial Affairs  Subcommittee held an oversight hearing  re garding  the Home Loan Guaranty Program.  Several witnesses at  that hearing discussed  the very difficult position that veterans are in  when their OVA guaranteed home loan is de faulted upon.  Two of our witnesses testified that without  the assistance of legal counsel their attempts  to  fight what  they considered  to be unjust  claims would be impossible.  It is a very diffi cult system to work under without legal advice  since,  in many cases,  the veteran may not  even be aware of an  indebtedness until col lection efforts have begun.  The  legislation  that  I, along with my col leagues on the House Veterans' Affairs Com mittee, have  introduced here  today calls  for  the lifting of the prohibition on allowing attor neys to be employed when the OVA is collect ing debts from veterans. In debt collection the  full weight of  the government can be em ployed  to collect with assistance  inside and  outside the Government, to deny veterans as sistance of attorneys  is  ludicrous. Not only  many debt collection efforts hurt  the credit  rating of the veterans, for active duty person nel it may mean the denial of a security clear ance; the effective end of an otherwise excel lent military career.  One needs to be mindful  that  the OVA  in  debt collection cases cannot be both the vet eran's friend and the agency charged with ag gressively pursuing debt collection. To deny  the veteran the opportunity to have a zealous  advocate is to deny the precis of the funda mental of due process enjoyed by citizens of  our great nation.  This legislation is similar to S. 2615-intro duced by Senate Veterans' Affairs Chairman  Mr.  CRANSTON  and Mr.  ROCKEFELLER,  a  member of the committee. I expect S. 2615 to  receive prompt attention in the Senate.  I urge my colleagues  to  join with me and  allow veterans the right to adequately defend  themselves.

H.R. 5158 authorizes an  increase of $12.3  billion over the fiscal year 1990 budget. This  measure not only increases funds for the De partments of Veterans Affairs and Housing  and Urban Development, but also includes the  National Aeronautics and Space Administra tion, the National Science Foundation and the  Environmental Protection Agency.  Mr. Chairman, our support of this measure  confirms the support in Congress for our vet erans by increasing funding to VA. H.R. 5158  will provide $31.3 billion to fund the Veterans  Health Service and Research Administration.  This includes increases in medical care, medi cal and prosthetic  research, as well as  in creases in compensation and benefits.  In regard to health care programs and per sonnel, H.R. 5158 will  increase  funding by  $1.6 billion more than  fiscal year 1990.

Again, I would point out  to my colleagues that the increase in  this bill are substantial, though they  are largely the increases requested by  the President. We  are $500 million  plus, below, in outlays what the Presi dent  requested. We  are within our  302(b) allocations, both as  to budget  authority and as to outlays. The 2-per cent cut is said to be nominal cut, but  it will have the effect of reducing the  NASA budget by $285 million, which I  would suggest is more than a nominal  cut in NASA. The 2-percent cut is said  to be a nominal cut, will have  the  effect of cutting the National Science  Foundation appropriation by $46 mil lion, which I have to tell the gentle man in that account is more than a  nominal cut. It will leave NASA $1.1  million below the President's request.  It will  leave  the National Science  Foundation  $92 million  below  the  President's request.  The President,  in his statement of  administration policy on this bill, has  criticized  the cuts  that we have al ready made in his request, and I par ticularly urge those of my colleagues  on the Republican side who want to  support the Presidential request of the  National Science Foundation, NASA,  and other agencies, to vote against the  amendment.

289,Senate,101,0.342,1245,11,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr.  President,  much of  this crime bill debate has  been about convicted criminals-their  rights of collateral appeals, for exam ple, and whether they can be constitu tionally put to death by the State for  their crimes.  Other parts of the debate have fo cused on other substantive and proce dural rights of criminal defendants.  This amendment, Mr. President,  different.  It focuses not on the perpetrators of  crime, but rather the victims of crime.  This amendment  is  the product of  independent work on my part, and on  the  part  of my  distinguished  col league, Senator NICKLES. I am pleased  that we have been able to join forces  on this amendment to the crime bill to  provide the only occasion the Senate  will have to support the rights of vic tims.  Our amendment establishes:  is  First, a bill of rights for the victims  of crime;  Second, services  to be provided  to  crime victims, once they have entered  the criminal justice system;  Third, improved means of providing  restitution to the victim of a crime;  Fourth, reversal of a recent Supreme  Court decision  that would allow de crees of bankruptcy  to discharge  a  valid order for restitution on the part  of a convicted criminal; and  Fifth, procedural rights for victims  to have  input  in a  distinct written  statement during the sentencing phase  of a Federal capital case.  Mr. President, we all work in what  has been called the murder capital of  the world-a place where crime scenes  are as commonplace as the neighbor hood ice cream truck on a June after noon.  As  the victims of violent crime  in crease  in  number,  our  senses  get  dulled. We necessarily lose our capac ity to feel any emotion for the pain  that the bloodshed causes victims and  their survivors.  Ironically, as the crimes grow more  outrageous, we are losing our ability to  be outraged, on behalf of crime's vic tims, and society.  In 1982, Congress enacted the Victim  and Witness Protection Act [VWPAJ  to try to address the rights of crime  victims.  This statute is well-intended, and I  was pleased to support it. But it needs  to be beefed up.  Under current law, the crime victim  does not have the right to communi cate his or her views distinctly to the  sentencing judge in Federal cases.  Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure  No. 32(c) provides only that a presen tence  report  be  prepared. Among  other things, the report, which is pre pared by court-appointed officers,  is  supposed to contain:  Information concerning any harm, includ ing  financial,  social,  psychological,  and  physical harm, done to or loss suffered by  any victim of the offense, and any other in formation  that may aid the court  in sen tencing,  including the restitution needs of  any victim of the offense.  Various States, on the other hand,  provide victims with the opportunity  to communicate to the court through  a ""victim  impact statement""  in non capital cases.  My portion of the Grassley /Nickles  amendment would apply this essential  rule,  in a more direct, distinct, and  formal procedure,  in Federal capital  cases.  No doubt, it will be argued that this  amendment is unconstitutional.  In 1987, by a bare 5-to-4 majority in  Booth versus Maryland, the Supreme  Court  determined  that  the  eighth  amendment prohibited a  jury  from  considering such a victim impact state ment during the sentencing phase of a  State capital trial.  But as has been often observed, ""the  Constitution is what five members of  the Court say it is.""  This opinion was written by Justice  Powell, who is no longer on the Court.  The question  is a very close one.  Other members of  the Court have  strongly urged reconsideration. This is  the Senate's way to take up the Su preme Court's offer to reconsider.  I  believe  that  a  distinct  victim  impact  statement-a  truthful  state ment on the loss of the victim and the  impact of  that  loss on  the victim's  family-can be presented to the trier  of fact during the sentencing phase of  the  proceeding without violating  a  convicted  defendant's  constitutional  due process safeguards.  Allow me  to describe  for my col leagues the circumstances surrounding  the deaths of the victims in the Booth  case.  I believe it will explain why I am  proposing this amendment, why I be lieve the Court ought to take another  look at this issue.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND  Mr. President, in 1983, Irvin Bron stein, aged 78, and his wife Rose, aged  75, were robbed  in  their west Balti more home.  The murderers,  John Booth  and  Willie Reid, entered the victims' home  for the apparent purpose of stealing  money to buy heroin.  Booth, a neighbor of the Bronsteins,  knew  that the couple could identify  him. So,  the Bronsteins were bound  and gagged and stabbed repeatedly in  their chests with a kitchen knife.  The Bronsteins' son discovered the  bodies of his parents 2 days later.  A Maryland jury found Booth guilty  of two counts of first-degree murder,  two counts of robbery, and conspiracy  to commit robbery.  The prosecution requested the death  penalty and Booth elected to have his  sentence  determined  by  the  jury  rather than the judge.  Before  the  sentencing  phase  of  Booth's prosecution began, the Mary land State Division of Parole and Pro bation compiled a presentence report  that  described Booth's background,  education,  employment history,  and  criminal record.  At that time, Maryland law also re quired  a  victim  impact  statement  [VISJ be considered during this phase  of the criminal proceedings.  The VIS was  intended  to describe  the effect of the crime on the victim  and his family. Compiled by the State,  the VIS  information was  to be sup plied by  the victim or his or her  family.  The VIS could be read to the jury  during  the sentencing phase or  the  victim's  family members  could  be  called to testify as to the information  contained in the VIS.  ",1990
290,Senate,101,-0.231,1258,11,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr.  President,  I  strongly  oppose  the  second-degree  amendment which essentially eviscer ates  the concept of this amendment  and  substantially negates  the argu ments that many of us made when we  were discussing the Racial Justice Act.  The Racial Justice Act, as you recall,  Mr. President, was a provision in the  original crime bill  that would have  said if a State had a statistical imbal ance as between the composition of its  population or various components of  its population and those to whom the  criminal  laws were applied, and par ticularly the death penalty, then the  States assumed the burden of showing  that they did not have a racially dis criminatory  criminal  justice  system  and would be precluded from utilizing  the death penalty until they had over come that presumption.  Mr. President,  the argument  that  many of us made was  that the Su preme Court has said that there is no  constitutional right to have any par ticular statistical outcome of your jus tice system, that our justice system is  predicated on  individual  justice and  that constitutional  rights are  those  things that relate  to your  individual  status, and there must be a showing of  discrimination in the specific case of  the defendant before the bar.  The whole purpose of this proposal  is to allow for a broad examination of  the justice system, not a narrow exam ination, as the chief justice of Florida  has stated when such a  commission  was established in my State, to look at  issues from the question of are we pre paring a sufficient number and proper ly prepared, trained lawyers that are  representative of  the population of  the State so that they can be available  to the justice system; are we training  persons to work in our justice system  in ways that will give us some assur ance that invidious but not necessarily  unconstitutional  racial  and  ethnic  practices are not being used to distort  the justice system.  It is  important, Mr. President, not  only that the substance of the justice  system be upheld but the constitution al standard be maintained. It is also  important, Mr. President,  that  the  perception, the perception, the view of  justice by the average American man  and woman be  that  this  is  a  fair  system. It is  to that goal that these  studies are directed.  Also these studies are not limited to  the specifics of an individual or class  of criminal defendant. They are  in tended to  look broadly, systemically,  at the process of  the  justice system  within our State.  As I indicated, Mr. President, this is  not a novel idea. States as diverse as  Florida, New Jersey, New York, Massa chusetts, and others have adopted a  proposal to initiate similar studies.  The Senator  from Utah  suggests  that these are going to be out-of-con trol commissions,  that  they will be  turned into sociological laboratories. If  we read the proposal, the amendment  says that these panels have to be es tablished  by  one  of  three  groups,  either  the highest court within  the  State, or by  the  legislature of  the  State, or by the Governor of the State.  None of  those  three convening au thorities is exactly likely to lose con trol of what is expected.  Second, I would point out that it is  up  to  the U.S. Attorney General  to  pass  judgement on  specific  applica tions for these grant funds. So a  re sponsible constitutional body within  the State must initiate, and the high est justice officer in the U.S. Govern ment must  approve  and  allocate,  before  these panels  to  study  racial  issues within a State's justice system,  so they can be funded and can move  forward, at least with Federal funds.  The States that have already initiat ed these studies have done so because  they felt it was in their State's inter est, sufficiently in their interest, that  they would  initiate  and  fund with  their State dollars. I believe this is an  appropriate area for the Federal Gov ernment to further encourage States  to  look  seriously  at  their  justice  system, and with that examination to  take such steps as that State considers  to be appropriate.  I believe and I do not feel I would  have any disagreement with either the  Senator from Utah or South Carolina,  that  this  is  a more appropriate  re sponse  than  the attempt  to convert  our justice system into a mathematical  system, which was the essence of the  original title I of S. 1970.  Mr. President, I  therefore strongly  urge  the defeat of  this amendment,  which would significantly undermine  the very purpose for which this pro posal is made: to encourage a serious  examination of the system of justice  within the State, and through that ex amination to give reassurance to the  public that justice for all is,  in fact,  not only an objective, but a  reality  within that State's justice system.

292,,101,0.196,1518,11,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I, along  with Congressman JOE SKEEN and Congress man BILL RICHARDSON, am  introducing a bill  to make a technical correction  in a land de scription contained in the San Juan Basin Wil derness Protection Act of 1984. A section of  the statute authorizes the Secretary of the In terior to convey to Sumner Lake Corp. certain  land situated in Lake Sumner State Park, NM.  For this  land  transfer to  take place,  the de scription should refer to section 33 instead of  section 34. The original bill inadvertently used  the wrong section number and this was only  recently discovered. The Department of  the  Interior has determined  that  this correction  cannot be effected administratively, but  re quires congressional action.  INTRODUCTION  OF  MOUNT.  SOPRIS TREE NURSERY LAND  EXCHANGE  ..,  HON. BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL  OF COLORADO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 28, 1990  ",1990
293,,101,-0.141,1518,11,Mr. CAMPBELL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I am  introducing  legislation  to allow  Pitkin and Eagle Counties to acquire an 186  tree nursery in the White River National Forest  in exchange for roughly 1,344 acres of patent ed mining claims which are owned by  the  counties.  The  tree  farm has been  targeted  for ex change, transfer or sale by the General Serv ices  Administration  [GSA].  The  counties  intend to use the tree farm to develop recre ational facilities,  for open space, and to build  a senior center. This exchange also protects  the property from  future private development  because  it contains a clause which directs  that all  the proceeds from any sale or lease  would go to the United States.  As you know,  the ski areas of Vail, Beaver  Creek, and Aspen are world  reknown. This  recognition has not been without cost. A tre mendous amount of stress has been placed  on  local facilities and property values are ski  high. The county needs land to fulfill responsi bilities  that  local governments have, but are  often overlooked by the public.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The bill also sets up an orderly process to  address any claims which may arise when the  United States is granted title to the patented  mining claims. This  is necessary  to prevent  any  further  forest management  problems  which could arise.  The Forest Service and  the counties have  been attempting  to complete  this exchange  administratively for many years. Unfortunately,  the cost of clearing the title on every acre of  property makes this  infeasible  in  light of the  stressed Forest Service and county budgets.  This exchange will  serve  a valuable public  purpose-and save the Government money.  MEDICAL  INSURANCE  SAFETY  NET MISSING  FOR MILLIONS  OF CITIZENS  HON. SAM GEJDENSON  OF CONNECTICUT  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 28, 1990  ",1990
294,,101,-0.416,1518,11,Mr. GEJDENSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I am sure  that my colleagues are well aware of the vast  number of  individuals-the poor,  the unem ployed, the working uninsured, and in fact, the  many children-who are without health insur ance coverage. Currently, an estimated 32 to  37 million  individuals  live on  a day-to-day  basis without  a medical  safety  net. They  cannot afford visits to the family doctor, have  no access  to preventive care, no means  to  obtain prenatal  care, and no protection  in  case of a medical emergency. Several worthy  proposals have already been  introduced by  Members of this body which seek to address  the problems of the uninsured.  Mr. Speaker,  legislators and other  individuals  in  the State of Connecticut have also  grappled with  this difficult issue. On May 17,  1990, Gov. William O'Neill approved a  farreaching  plan  to make  health  insurance  cheaper and more accessible  to  the unin sured. As many as 37 disparate groups of in dividuals were  involved in  the drafting of this  legislation, ranging  from citizen-action groups  to insurance industry representatives.  The new law will extend health coverage to  an additional 60,000 Connecticut representa tives, at a cost of $2 million. This is a signifi cant step  toward a  resolution of  the health  access crisis on a State level. I would first like  to commend my colleagues in Connecticut for  all of their efforts in this area. As well, I would  encourage legislators from other States and at  Federal level to give this legislation close con sideration:  AN ACT CONCERNING THE RECOMMENDATIONS  OF THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON STATE  HEALTH INSURANCE  Summary: This bill expands access to and  increases  the  availability of health  care  services and  insurance coverage  to people  currently without health insurance or with  inadequate coverage. It allows expansion of  Medicaid, within available appropriations,  to serve more children, pregnant women, el derly, and disabled people. It also requires  granting presumptive eligibility to pregnant  women applying for Medicaid. The bill ex pands a current Medicaid waiver program  assisting disabled children and adults.  also allows for a Medicaid ""buy-out,"" within  available funds, to encourage Medicaid-eligiIt  June 28, 1990  accept  employment-based  ble  people  to  health coverage.  The bill allows the Department of Health  Services [DOHSl, based on available fund ing,  to contract with  insurers  to develop  both subsidized nongroup health insurance  for children and pregnant women, and in surance for people with disabilities.   DOHS can establish, again based on avail able  funding, a grant program  to expand  access to primary care services.  The  bill  requires  creation  of  ""special  health care plans"" offered by health insur ers and health care centers-HMO's-for a  limited time to small employers who are not  currently offering their employees any cov erage. It is also available to individuals. Spe cial health care plans must be available to  certain low-income individuals through the  existing Health Reinsurance Association  [ERAl.  The bill includes a number of small group  market reforms designed to increase afford ability  and  accessibility  of  insurance  through  creation of  a  reinsurance  pool,  limits on premiums  that can be charged,  limits  on  use  of  pre-existing  condition  clauses, disclosure of specified rating prac tices, and other measures.  Under the bill, the Commission on Hospi tals and Health Care [CHHCl must address  Medicare cost shifting and improvements in  its data gathering.  Finally, the bill creates a Health Access  Commission within  the  legislative branch  charged with monitoring the programs to be  developed under the bill and their effect on  addressing trhe uninsured population.  WELCOMING THE THAI  PRIME  MINISTER'S VISIT TO UNITED  STATES,  AND  ENDORSING  THAI ANTIDRUG EFFORTS AS  A MODEL FOR THE REGION  HON. CHARLES B.

295,,101,-0.514,1518,11,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  last week  the  Thai Prime Minister, Chatichai Choonhavan,  visited the United States. Thai antidrug efforts  serve as a model for Asia.

296,,101,-0.259,1531,11,Mr. JONES of North Carolina.," Mr. Speaker,  today I introduce a bill to provide for the bond ing of non-vessel-operating common carriers,  and for other purposes.  The Shipping Act of 1984 ("" 1984 act"") de fines a ""non-vessel-operating common carri er"" [NVOCC] as ""* * * a common carrier that  does not operate  the vessels by which  the  ocean  transportation  is provided, and  is a  shipper  in  its  relationship with  an  ocean  common carrier."" 46 U.S.C. app. § 1702(17).  NVOCC's hold themselves out to the public to  provide common carriage. They generally con solidate the shipments of small shippers and  take advantage of full container rates that are  offered by ocean common carriers. NVOCC's  assume  full  responsibility  for  the shipments  that  they handle and  issue bills of lading  to  the underlying shippers.  Although NVOCC's act as  intermediaries  like ocean  freight  forwarders, unlike forward ers, NVOCC's are not licensed or bonded by  the Federal Maritime Commission  [FMC] or  otherwise subject to any restrictions on entry.  However, as common carriers, NVOCC's are  subject to the tariff filing requirements of sec tion 8 of the 1984 act, 46 U.S.C. app. § 1707,  and to the prohibitions set forth in section 1 O  of the act, 46 U.S.C. app. § 1709. There are  approximately  1,450 NVOCC's operating  in  the U.S. foreign commerce.  Over the past several years,  the FMC has  received an  increasing number of complaints  concerning the activities of NVOCC's. During  fiscal year 1989; the FMC's Office of Informal  Inquiries and Complaints dealt with 61  infor mal complaints about NVOCC practices. The  complainants  included  representatives  from  many segments of  the ocean  transportation  industry-shippers/importers,  ocean  freight  forwarders, ocean common carriers,  terminal  operators, and ports. Their complaints reflect ed an  increasing pattern of unlawful conduct  by NVOCC's that has had significant adverse  impacts. These problems are often exacerbat ed by the fact that many NVOCC's lack tangi ble assets.  One of the recurring problems is the situa tion where a shipper prepays freight charges  to an NVOCC, but when  the consignee at tempts to obtain release of the cargo,  it dis covers it must first pay the ocean carrier be cause  the NVOCC has  failed  to do so.  In  other  instances, NVOCC's have gone bank rupt and shippers or consignees have had to  pay duplicate charges  to obtain  release of  cargo. NVOCC bankruptcies have also affect ed ocean carriers and inland carriers who are  owed money by such NVOCC's.  In addition,  ocean  freight  forwarders have  indicated  that  NVOCC's have failed to pay them compensa tion for their services.  A bonding requirement for NVOCC's should  ameliorate most of  these problems. A bond,  obtained  through an acceptable surety com pany, would be available to pay any judgment  for damages arising out of an NVOCC's activi16605  ties as a common  carrier providing ocean  transportation services. The bond could also  be used  to satisfy any order of  reparations  issued pursuant to section 11 of the 1984 act.  Consistent with an NVOCC's status as both a  shipper and a carrier under the 1984 act and  its  relationship with ocean common carriers  and underlying shippers, the bill would protect  all who are injured by an NVOCC's activities.  Shippers who  rely upon NVOCC's would be  primarily protected, but so also would ocean  carriers, and others involved  in ocean  trans portation system.  The bond would also be available to satisfy  any penalty assessed against an NVOCC pur suant to section 13 of the 1984 act. All  too  often  the  FMC  has  initiated  proceedings  against an NVOCC,  found  that violations of  the act have occurred, assessed appropriate  penalties, and then had to engage in lengthy,  resource intensive efforts to collect those pen alties. Permitting the FMC to move against the  bond will make its enforcement efforts much  more effective and efficient.  The bill  sets a minimum amount  for an  NVOCC bond-that is, $50,000. The FMC can  set a higher level after notice and comment  rulemaking.  It will have the continuing flexibil ity to adjust the level of the bond as changing  circumstances warrant.  In an effort to achieve parity of treatment,  the bill will affect all NVOCC's operating in the  U.S.  foreign  commerce. This will  include a  larger number of NVOCC's who are  foreign based but who are presently subject to exist ing tariff filing requirements. They will also be  required to obtain a bond from a surety found  acceptable by  the U.S. Department of  the  Treasury.  The bill does not contain distinct penalties  for noncompliance. Inasmuch as the bill pro vides for an additional section to the 1984 act,  the penalties set forth in section 13 of the act,  46 U.S.C. app. § 1712, will apply to any viola tion of the instant provision or of any regula tion issued thereunder. This would result in a  penalty of not more than $5,000 for each vio lation unless it was willfully or knowingly com mitted, in which case the amount of the penal ty would be not greater than $25,000 for each  violation. In addition, the bill would amend the  1984 act so  that  the FMC can suspend or  cancel an NVOCC's tariff if it fails to maintain  the  requisite bond or does not designate a  resident agent  for service of process. As  is  the case with an ocean freight forwarder's li cense under section 19(b) of  the 1984 act,  the FMC will be able to suspend or cancel an  NVOCC's tariff without a formal hearing.  The bill also adds new prohibited acts  to  section 10 of the 1984 act. Ocean common  carriers will be prohibited from accepting any  cargo  from or transporting cargo  for the ac count of an NVOCC  that  is not bonded or  does not have a valid FMC tariff on file. Simi larly, ocean common carriers will be prohibited  from  entering  into  service  contracts with  NVOCC's who are not bonded or are untar iffed. This includes not only service contracts  in which an NVOCC  is  the signatory shipper  but also contracts  in which an NVOCC  is  listed as an affiliate. As a result, ocean carri ers will need to ascertain whether an NVOCC  seeking its services is indeed bonded and tar",1990

298,,101,-0.06,1557,11,Mr. ERDREICH.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing a joint resolution designating April 7  through April 13, 1991, as  ""National County  Government Week.""  County government has become increasing ly  important in most States as a provider of  areawide and local municipal services. In addi tion to running  the jails, the courts,  the elec tions, and collecting the taxes, counties have  become the governments of last resort in pro viding services  for  the poor,  the homeless,  and disadvantaged citizens. My home district  of Jefferson County  is a perfect example of  what  is happening all over  the  country  in  terms of the services provided by county gov ernments.  In 1982,  the budget was around  $100 million. It is now $220 million, $40 million  of which is devoted to providing health care to  low-income patients of the county hospital.  In  promoting  greater  economic  develop ment, Jefferson County has  joined with  the  city of Birmingham and other municipalities to  help existing businesses and  to attract new  ventures. The city of Birmingham and Jeffer son County together built a civic center and a  flagship hotel. The county has also been  in strumental in developing a new research park  and also provides  low-interest loans to small  businesses thus helping to create jobs.  What  is happening  in my home county  is  happening all over the country. The phenome nal growth in services provided by counties is  evidenced by  the corresponding  increase  in  county expenditures. Counties spent almost  $103 billion  last year compared  to only $13  billion  in  1970.  Likewise,  over  1.9 million  people are now employed  in county govern ment nationwide. Certainly, each of you has  felt  the growing  influence of county govern ment in your district.  I am sure you are aware  that many Mem bers of Congress served  in county govern ment at one time in  their careers.  In fact, 74  Representatives are  former county officials.  Another 13 Senators also served  in county  government. I myself served for 8 years as a  county commissioner in Jefferson County, AL,  and have witnessed the dedication and eff ec tiveness of those who work in county govern ment.  In  light of  the  tremendous  contributions  made by county governments nationwide,  I  believe  it  is appropriate  that we designate  April 7 through April 13 as ""National County  Government Week.""  I urge my colleagues to  support this joint resolution.  16631  THE BUSH PLAN FOR LATIN  AMERICA  HON. JOHN J. LaFALCE  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 28, 1990  ",1990
299,House,101,0.336,35,16,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New York  [Mr. LAFALCE], who has  shown the strength of his convictions.  D 1240  Mr. LAF ALCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise  today  in  support of  the  substitute  amendment.  I  said yesterday,  I  say  again today, we need a strong and a  fair civil  rights  law. The recent Su preme Court cases of  the last  term  have created a need for new legisla tion. And even after reversal of these  decisions and restoration of preexist ing  law,  that  is not good  enough.  There  is a need for a stronger civil  rights  law that was passed 26 years  ago in a different time in different cir cumstances.  But let me also express the need for  a fair civil rights bill, a bill that equal ly balances the rigths of a plaintiff  and a defendant, an accuser and the  accused.  We must not unbalance the scales of  justice. That will not  advance  the  cause of civil rights.  Nor will the cause of civil rights be  advanced if what we do today leads to  a veto. And both of these prospects  concern me deeply.  We passed two amendments yester day;  I voted for both of  them. But  there are countless other  legitimate  questions that have been raised about  disparate-impact cases, especially.  I am troubled by the issue of causa tion involving a group of employment  practices, I am troubled by the defini tion of business necessity, I am also  deeply troubled at converting the rec onciliation process under  the EEOC  into  an  adversarial  process  before  judge and jury. That is a fundamental  change in title VII. It has nothing to  do with Supreme Court cases.  Nor am I persuaded that the cap  that was approved last night will pre vent punitive  judgments from being  rendered  by  juries  in  exorbitant  amounts.  There is, for example, no limit on  damages for pain and suffering. The  line between damages for pain and suf fering and punitive damages is impos sible or difficult to discern and very,  very easy to transgress.  Now, there is a substitute before us  today. That substitute is not perfect,  either, but it is a good-faith effort to  advance the cause. It is a good-faith  effort  to serve as a bridge between  polar differences. It does address the  Supreme Court decisions in question,  it really does. And it goes further by  making major  improvements  under  current law.  It contains new and equitable reme dies,  immediate injunctive relief and  up to $100,000 in equitable relief. That  does -not exist  right now,  remedies  that can be used to fight harassment,  retaliation and other on-the-job dis crimination.  Now, I also know, after considerable  discussion with  civil  rights  leaders,  that they have deep concerns about  the substitute that is before us today,  as I have deep concerns about Kenne dy-Hawkins.  Should  the  substitute  pass  before  a  conference  report  emerges, those concerns must be dealt  with. But what do we do today?  I am going to make a suggestion to  both sides. I am going to suggest, in  order to deal with the differences, in  order to deal with the divisions that  we have seen, a vote ""yes"" on the sub stitute and then, whatever happens, a  vote ""yes"" on final passage, on every body's part.  Now, if we vote ""yes"" on the substi tute, we go  to conference with  the  Senate with dozens of differences be tween the House bill and the Senate  bill. And we can work, and I know we  would work, to come out on a biparti san or nonpartisan fashion with a bill  that the President could sign.  So, if the substitute passes, I urge all  of us to vote ""yes"" on final passage.  If the substitute should fail, I have a  concern. There is virtually nothing to  go  to conference on other than the  issue of the cap on punitive damages.  It is identical.  The President has  said  that cap  means nothing, both personally and in  writing. He has said he could not sign  Kennedy-Hawkins.  I  am fearful  that political games manship  could  be  played,  and we  would  be more  interested  in  just  taking the two bills,  ironing out the  differences on the cap in an hour and  sending the bill to the President, and  we would not have advanced the cause  of civil rights.  But if good faith is shown, it is possi ble to forget about the fact that there  is little to conference about. If good  faith is shown, it is possible to still get  together with those who have difficul ties and with the President and come  up with a bill that could receive the  signature of the President or, if not, a  bill on which there would be such a  consensus  that  it would  have  to  become law.  Because of that good faith for which  I would hope, I will vote for the substi tute and urge everyone to. If it passes,  please vote for final passage, do not  vote against it.  If the substitute goes down, please  vote  for  final passage of Kennedy Hawkins. Do not vote against it.  And both sides, whoever gets to con ference, show good faith. Let us have a  civil rights bill that an overwhelming,  at  least  a  two-thirds,  consensus of  both bodies can support. I want very  much to work in that direction.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will an nounce to those Members controlling  the  time  that  the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania [Mr. GOODLING] has 12  minutes  remaining,  the  gentleman  from California [Mr. HAWKINS] has 13  minutes  remaining,  the  gentleman  from Texas [Mr. BROOKS] has 8¥2 min utes  remaining,  and  the gentleman  from Texas [Mr. BROOKS] reserves the  right to close debate.

300,House,101,-0.315,35,16,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Chairman and  my colleagues,  last night and again  this morning I sat through most of the  debate. Last evening about 8 o'clock, I  went out onto the west portico and  watched the sunset for a while. There  were people milling around out there,  a couple of dozen tourists, I suppose,  looking down The Mall at the beauti ful  scene; down The Mall  to  those  monuments  to our  freedoms. They  seemed unaware that in the people's  House behind them, here in this room,  another civil rights debate was occur ing.  It is not that those tourists were un concerned, and I do not denigrate the  debate; I seek, rather, to define it.  We are all of us involved at a stage  in  the  long march of  this Nation  toward civil rights. The steps we are  taking now are small ones. It was not  always so.  In the 1860's and again in the 1960's  blood was  spilled between brothers  and friends, careers were lost, men and  women were killed.  But in those two great tests, one the  Civil War and  the other  the Civil  Rights Act of a quarter century ago,  this Nation  took  gigantic  steps  to  assure simple freedoms. Is it not odd  that the greatest political struggles of  the 200-year history of  this Nation  have been to assure and preserve our  simplest of freedoms?  We are not taking a large step this  week; but small steps are  important  too. These small,  incremental steps,  about which the lawyers understand ably argue, are very important in this  Nation's  long march  toward  civil  rights.  In  the 1960's, our colleagues,  the  Members of the House of Representa tives, voted to change America forever,  to say that never again would a race of  people be relegated to the back of de mocracy's bus.  D 1250  People were not milling around un concerned outside  then. The world  held its breath to see if this Nation  would renew itself.  Today's debate is not about a great  step. It is an incremental change, but  the sides are the same, the arguments  are the same. We can, in a couple of  hours here, vote for the private sector,  which would be a vote for Michel-La Falce, or we can vote for the private  citizen which would be a vote ""no.""

301,House,101,-0.214,87,16,Mr. MCMILLEN of Maryland.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  in support of  the  Swift bill.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the  Campaign Cost Reduction and Reform Act of  1990, and also note my support for the Synar Obey amendment.  Mr. Chairman, for years the cost of Federal  election campaigns have spiraled up and up.  The high price of television advertising, com puters, and polling  is  forcing candidates  to  spend increasing amounts of time or raising  money, rather focusing on the issues.  Representative Sw1FT's proposal  is an ex cellent step forward  to  reforming a system  that is in serious need of change. Most impor tant,  it places a cap on campaign financing.  The Bill  also  reduces  the  influence of  so called fat cat PAC's that do not get most of  their funds from the small contributor. The bill  treats  these PAC's differently,  reducing  the  amount they can give to each campaign. And,  it effectively ends the soft money scam that  has been a big loophole to our campaign dis closure system.  I also want to express my support for the  Synar-Obey amendment which will be offered  to the Swift bill. This additional proposal adds  even more teeth to the Swift bill by reducing  the aggregate PAC  limit to 40 percent of the  spending limit; cuts in half individual contribu tions;  and  increases  the  reporting  require ments  to  the Federal Election Commission.  The measure is also a major improvement to  our system by limiting to 1 O percent of a can didates spending limit, the amount that can be  taken for the fat cat PAC's I must admit that I  have severe reservations about the public fi nancing aspect of this measure-but, on the  whole,  it will  improve  the overall  election  system.  Mr. Chairman, the Republican substitute is  not a genuine attempt at campaign finance  reform, but a partisan proposal  to  improve  their chances for election. They cannot get a  majority of voters to support them at the polls,  so  they want  to change  the  rules  in  their  favor. No spending limits, no restrictions on in dividual expenditures, no decent reform of soft  money.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the  Swift proposal, and  the Synar-Obey amend ment. The American public  is clammoring for  compaign finance reform, we cannot miss this  opportunity today.  ",1990

We have laws that set dates  for us in the budget process, set dates  for us on the appropriations process,  and we do not meet those.  I am  just at a  loss  to understand  what it is about passing this feel-good  resolution about when we are going to  meet  these deadlines, what we  are  going to do for the next 30 days, what  this-what good this possibly has.  Why cannot the Speaker and the mi nority leader, the majority leader and  minority leader of the Senate walk out  of here and have a press conference  and announce when they are going to  come to some kind of an agreement?  You do not need us to say, we are not  a part of the budget summit process.  You do not need us to day do it. We  need it to be done. I do not see why we  are going to put this fig leaf over us  when it is clear it has no authority,  does not do anything.  ",1990

307,House,101,0.421,152,16,Mr. GOSS.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  support of  the  rule  and  commend  Chairman  JONES  for his persistence  and hard work.  Mr. Speaker, tonight we have the opportuni ty to complete some very necessary work that  began more  than 15 years ago and which  lead to the adoption of landmark oilspill pre this House a months  vention  legislation by  ago.  In the 8 months since we passed the oilspill  bill, the conference process has taken place,  and unfortunately so have many disastrous  oilspills. Arthur Kill,  the Mega Borg explosion,  and  now Galveston  Bay  have  repeatedly  awakened  the Nation's  conscience  to  the  he~vy toll our coasts endure from up to 8,000  spills a year. Continuously, our Nation has re vealed itself to be badly underprepared to ef fectively combat oilspills.  This debate  focuses on  the  rule, and not  the bill itself. However, if we defeat this rule  our Nation will be unnecessarily left at risk b;  the 600 to 1,000 oilspills which we can rea sonably project could happen in the next 1 to  2 months. That's neither sound  fiscal policy  nor wise environmental policy.  We have good  legislation before us whose  timeliness cannot be contested. Now  is not  the moment to delay this bill over some  last  minute minutiae.  Our Nations' energy security obviously must  not be held hostage by the threat posed by a  dangerous madman  in  Iraq, and similarly we  also cannot allow our Nation's coasts to be  held hostage  to  the daily barrage of oilspills  against which we need better defenses.  We need the oilspill cleanup trust fund. We  need  the emergency strike  teams. We need  the research and development funds  to fight  future spills. Mr. Speaker, we need an oilspill  bill, and we need it now. I urge my colleagues  to support the rule and the bill.  I  the gentlewo~an  Mr.  PASHA YAN.

308,House,101,0.276,152,16,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker  I rise  in support of the rule for H.R. '1465the Oil Pollution Prevention and Li ability Act.  For the past year,  the Nation has  been faced with the need to clean up  oil spills on virtually all of its coasts.  H.R. 1465 contains the comprehensive  measures-such  as  double  hulls on  tankers-designed to prevent such dis asters and adequately address  them  should they occur in the future.  As has been said on this floor al ready, the contents of this bill are ex tremely vital  to  the  future of  this  country-to its energy future-particu larly in view of this week's events.  Therefore, we must proceed to pass  this  important  piece  of  legislation  now. We cannot afford any delay.  Mr. Speaker, this not a perfect rule,  but I support the rule and I urge my  colleagues to do likewise in the name  of marine safety and protecting the  environment.  ",1990

310,House,101,-0.318,152,16,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the rule and the legislation.  Mr. Speaker,  I rise to congratulate my col leagues who worked so long, and so hard to  hammer out the Oil Pollution Prevention Re sponse, Liability and Compensation Act before  this House, today.  This legislation is a giant step forward in the  protection  of  our Nation's  natural marine  treasures.  Importantly,  for  the people of the  Pacific Northwest,  this  legislation has signifi cant protections for two crown  jewels of our  region-the Columbia River and Puget Sound.  Both  receive significant  traffic  in petroleum  and fertilizer cargoes. Both will get new safe guards against spills, and assurances for more  rapid and effective cleanup under this bill.  I also thank the conferees for their willing ness to consider and incorporate language on  enforcement of contingency planning which  mirrored  legislation  introduced  last spring by  me and two Oregon colleagues-LES AUCOIN  and PETER DEFAZIO. This much-needed addi tion will  give  the Environmental Protection  Agency a significant new hammer-fines of up  to $25,000 per day-to use against hazardous  chemical carriers who refuse to do good-faith  contingency planning  for spills. This kind of  good-faith  planning-planning  that  includes  the  provision  of equipment and  personnel  needed  to do  the  job-greatly reduces  the  bad effects of spills when they do occur. One  need  look no  further than  the Exxon Valdez  ?isaster to see what happens when planning  1s poor, half-hearted, or non-existent: spill im pacts are many times worse, and many times  more expensive to deal with.  This bill helps cure that problem as well as  many others concerning the protection of this  Nation's coastlines and waterways.  I urge my  colleagues to vote for it.  I urge the President  to sign it.  ",1990
311,House,101,-0.153,152,16,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Speaker,  just  briefly, putting aside the merits of the  North Carolina  issue-and  I  think  there is sufficient justification-is this  fact: A vote against the previous ques tion basically, and a defeat of the rule,  is a def eat really of oils pill legislation  for the eighth time, I believe, since I  have been here.  We have sent seven oil pollution bills  to the Senate over the 15112 years that  I have been here. It has taken us the  better part of 1112 years to move this  through to this point, through seven  different committees of the House and  probably one of the most painful con ferences  that has  taken place, and  frankly the conference has been dis banded.  So I would urge you to vote for the  previous question, and for the rule.  ",1990

313,House,101,0.591,360,16,Mr. HEFLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  strong support of this resolution. As cochair man of  the House Task Force  in Angola,  I  have become  increasingly concerned about  the desperate situation  in Angola. Hundreds  and  thousands of people are  in danger of  dying if assistance does not begin within the  month.  This resolution seeks to bring together, for  the  first  time,  the Government of Angola  [MPLA] and  the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] in an act of  humanitarian cooperation.  As my colleagues know, Angola has been  enbroiled  in a bitter civil war for the  last 15  years. This, combined with the recent drought  has created a truly alarming situation. We ask  that the MPLA and UNITA begin discussions  with  international  relief  organizations,  the  United Nations and any countries willing  to  offer assistance,  to create an agreement  to  allow relief supplies to be distributed through out all of Angola by the most efficient manner.  It is my hope, and the hope of many of my  colleagues,  that  the peace negotiations be tween  the MPLA and UNITA, which began  several months ago, will be further faciliated  as they work together to resolve this desper ate crisis. We must do what we can  foster  peace in Angola and bring an end to the civil  war.  I ask the members of this Chamber to put  aside  your  own  political  beliefs  on  this  manner, and  to trust your heart. Do  the hu manitarian  thing. Do  the  right  thing. Vote  in  favor of this resolution.  ",1990
314,House,101,-0.112,360,16,Mr. MCCURDY.," I rise in strong support of the  resolution concerning the tragic famine that is  threatening  the  lives of so many people  in  Angola. This resolution was put together on a  bipartisan basis under  the  leadership of  the  chairman of  the Hunger Committee, Repre sentative TONY HALL, and  it ranking minority  member, Representative BILL EMERSON. It ad dresses what the U.S. Office of Foreign Disas ter Assistance has called the worst humanitar ian crisis on the African Continent.  Mr. Speaker, the importance of this resolu tion  is highlighted by  the  fact  that Angola  faces a famine that could easily rival those ex perienced by Ethiopia and Sudan  in  recent  years. At least 250,000 Agolans face the im mediate threat of starvation, and it is possible  that even more people are at risk. This resolu tion serves as a vehicle to bring this crisis to  the world's attention.  Perhaps equally important, Mr. Speaker, this  resolution  is  a  balanced,  bipartisan  effort  which urges  the Government of Angola and  the UNIT A rebels to set aside political differ ences and work with other countries in south ern Africa to ensure that food is delivered to  all Angolans throughout the country, and to do  so  in  the most efficient and  cost-effective  manner.  It also calls upon the United Nations  to play an active role in developing a compre hensive agreement  for  the safe passage of  relief  supplies,  including  from  neighboring  countries.  Finally, Mr. Speaker,  this  resolution points  out the important fact that this famine is exac erbated by the ongoing civil war in Angola and  uges all parties to the conflict to work toward  a cessation of hostilities and to reach a nego tiated settlement. As chairman of the biparti san House task force on Angola,  I,  too, sup port a negotiated settlement. Indeed, negotia tions are  the only path  to peace  in Angola.  But if Angola is to have a lasting peace and  reduce the possibility of future famines, a vital  component of any negotiated settlement must  be a firm guarantee that Angolans will be able  to determine  their own destiny  through  the  democratic process-a process based on the  consent of the governed  through  free, multi party elections.  Mr. Speaker, Angola  is a country of great  potential.  Instead of experiencing the horrors  of famine, Angola could serve as a breadbas ket  for  the  rest of southern Africa.  It  is my  hope  that  this  resolution will play a part  in  helping Angolans overcome this crisis and join  the community of democratic nations.  ",1990

316,Senate,101,-0.293,516,16,Mr. WIRTH.," Mr. President, I yield  myself such time as I many consume.  Mr. President, the arguments from  those who  oppose  the  amendment  have some interesting inconsistencies.  The argument has been made  that  somehow the military-although they  did it for 9 years prior to 1988-cannot  account  for how much an abortion  costs.  I would be embarrassed if I were the  Secretary of Defense to know his De partment is making that argument. No  wonder  they have accounting prob lems  and  procurement  scandals,  if  they cannot add up simple costs.  The argument  is made that some how we allow people to be transported  on military planes to go someplace else  to have an abortion. Yet they say we  cannot have any public financing for  abortion.  Mr. President, what is transporting  somebody to have an abortion? Is that  transport not occurring on military  aircraft paid for by the taxpayers? Of  course it is, Mr. President.  The  inconsistencies  continue. The  argument  is made  that nobody has  ever been denied leave to go have an  abortion. I never argued that anybody  had been denied leave to have an abor tion. The argument is made that there  have been no complaints on this issue.  Well, I read a very eloquent and very  moving letter. To suggest that there  are no complaints is absolutely untrue.  The  record  is  replete.  I have made  that case over and over again.  The argument  is made  that there  have been no legal challenges. Why in  the world should  there have  to be  legal challenges  from people whose  career is in the military or whose de pendents are worried about endanger ing the career of their spouse who is in  the military? It does not make any  sense whatsoever.  On  the  issue of airlift and airlift  availa.bility, the Senator from Oregon  was absolutely eloquent.

321,Senate,101,-0.419,698,16,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr.  President,  last  Friday  the Senate  adopted Senate  Resolution 315, expressing the sense  of  the Senate  that President Bush  should provide  relief  to  the Philip pines in the aftermath of the devastat ing July 16 earthquake. I  introduced  both Senate Resolution 315 and an  earlier bill, S. 2883, because the Philip pine people are our oldest allies  in  Asia, and are deserving of our help in  this hour of great need.  Earlier today, I had the privilege of  meeting with the Philippine Secretary  of Finance, who advised me that al though  the  initial  relief efforts are  largely complete, the toughest part of  the job remains. Massive repairs must  be undertaken to put the earthquake damaged regicn back on its feet again.  The death  toll will ultimately reach  several thousand. Property losses are  estimated at $300 million. The Philip pine people are pleading for assistance  in meeting this crisis.  I  understand  the Department  of  State is looking for ways to help fund  the rehabilitation efforts and is con sidering using money available under  the authority of  the Foreign Assist ance Act. I commend the administration for moving to lend assistance to  the Philippines,  but  I would  urge  President Bush to act quiclt.ly to pro vide additional assistance under au thority of the Foreign Assistance Act.  Mr. President, we must bear in mind  the overall  situation  in  the Philip pines. The freely elected Government  faces  many  problems  that  have  strained resources to the limit. Unem ployment  and poverty  remain very  high. The Government must still con tend with  threats from  rural  insur gents and rebel elements of the mili tary. On top of all this, a crushing for eign debt takes up to 40 percent of the  national budget for repayment.  Given these facts, an event like the  recent earthquake  is a heavy body blow that could undermine the stabili ty of the Philippine Government at a  time when it is particularly vulnera ble. It is imperative that the United  States act compassionately and quick ly to provide funding  to one of our  most  trusted allies  in  this  time of  need. I urge my colleagues to join me  in this effort.  THE INVASION OF KUWAIT BY  IRAQ  ",1990
322,Senate,101,0.495,711,16,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  with my colleague from Utah, Senator  HATCH, to introduce legislation to com plete the Central Utah Water Project  CCUPl and to increase the authoriza tion ceiling necessary  to accomplish  that task.  Since the Utah congressional delega tion first introduced the CUP comple tion bill almost 3 years ago, we have  endeavored to craft legislation which  is sensitive to the new realities of the  arid west. We've learned that in order  to build water projects, they must be  cost-efficient, environmentally sound,  and in this case, address the legitimate  needs of Native Americans who are  participants in the project.  Our delegation has negotiated with  our Colorado River Basin State neigh bors, environmental groups  in Utah  and here in Washington, Indian Tribal  representatives, Public Power entities,  farmers, and urban water users. We  have not found reaching an agreement  amongst these disparate groups to be  easy. In fact, negotiations have been  protracted and frustrating. Yet, now,  after some 3 years, we do have a bill  which we think meets all of those tests  which  are demanded of westerners  who want Federal water projects.  First, by having the Central Utah  Water Conservancy District construct  the remaining water delivery features,  the cost of construction can be  re duced substantially. This is borne out  by previous experiences where, with  the district in charge of contracting  authority, construction costs were re duced by over 35 percent from projec tions made by the Bureau of Reclama tion. The bill authorizes completion of  both the municipal and irrigation f ea tures of the CUP.  Second, the bill establishes what the  National Wildlife Federation refers to  as one of, if not the most, aggressive  water conservation plans for the Cen tral Utah project of any conservation  plan in the country. Local water dis tricts  have  embraced  the proposed  plan and  look forward  to stretching  out  the  scarce water  supplies  the  project will provide.  The  legislation requires  local cost sharing for  the  remaining construc tion features at a rate of 35 percent.  This  is  a  substantial  sum  for  the  people of Utah to pay. But, Mr. Presi dent  I  believe  this burden  is  one  Utahns will bear in order to assure an  adequate, long-term water supply for  our State.  Finally, the bill will provide for com pletion of the long neglected environ mental mitigation features associated  with the CUP and as I mentioned ear lier, will honor the Government's com mitments to the Ute Indian Tribe. All in-all, this legislation represents a sub stantial change in approach to water  resource development projects.  I be lieve  it reflects  the  realities of  the  1990's while honoring  the  commit ments made by the Government to the  people of Utah in the 1950s. This Gov ernment will be made to keep its word.  Senator HATCH and I, along with our  three House colleagues, are pleased to  recommend this bill to the Congress  and hope that it will be enacted into  law before the lOlst Congress comes  to an end.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that an explanation of the legisla tion be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  EXPLANATION OF THE CENTRAL UTAH PROJECT  BILL  Section 1. Short Title and Table of Con tents.  Sec. 2.

323,Senate,101,0.135,724,16,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President,  the President's veto of the Family and  Medical Leave Act and the subsequent  failure of the House to override that  veto, while a setback, should not be  seen  as  the end of our efforts  to  ensure that working people are able to  care for their families and meet basic  economic needs.  Today, we  are  reintroducing  the  Family and Medical Leave Act. We are  sending a signal that we stand firmly  behind our Nation's families and our  commitment to enact a comprehensive  and sound family leave policy.  What we are saying with this bill is  simple  justice:  A  single  mother  shouldn't be forced to lose her job to  take care of a dangerously ill child. A  father should be able to count on re turning to work after taking care of  his family's emergency at home.  Fairness in the workplace will pay  off for employers, too. Understanding  the problems  that families  face will  bring dividends  in  the way workers  feel about their work. Instead of losing  valuable productivity on the job, em ployers with  leave policies  in place  report gains in productivity and reten tion of a loyal and experienced work force.  The demographic revolution in the  American work force is having a pro found effect on the lives of working  men and women and  their families.  Today, more than half of the 45.6 mil lion children  in  two-parent  families  have both parents in the work force.  The number of women working out side the home has increased 178 per cent since 1950. More than one-half of  all mothers with infants under 1 year  of age now work outside  the home.  Two-thirds  of mothers  of  children  under the age of 3 work outside the  home.  We are not strangers to these statis tics. We have heard them here before.  It is time we face up to the changing  reality of our economy-single parents  and  two wage-earning parents domi nate the work force. It is time now to  take action, to ensure that no longer  will American workers have  to  face  difficult choices as they seek to bal ance family and workplace responsibil ities. The dual goals of  family and  work are  important  to our Nation's   well-being. It is time we support work ing parents by providing flexible leave  options which promote family stability  and. job security.  The Family and Medical Leave Act  being introduced again today will help  ease the tremendous pressures parents  face  in  balancing  workplace  and  family responsibilities. It is essentially  the same bill passed by the Senate on  June 14  this year. That bill was the  result of months of effort and was a  carefully-tuned  compromise  which  sought to take into consideration the  concerns of business and the needs of  our Nation's working families.  This legislation requires companies  of 50 or more employees to allow their  permanent workers 12 weeks of unpaid  leave per year for the birth of a baby  or serious family illness. Data from my  own State of Oregon, which has a  family  leave  standard of 12 weeks,  finds that businesses have had little  trouble in complying with the stand ard.  Under  this bill, only workers who  have been on the  job for a year or  more and who have worked an average  of half time or more during that year  would be eligible for unpaid leave. Em ployees would be assured of reinstate ment  to  the same or equivalent  job  upon their return, and would continue  to receive health care coverage during  their absence. The General Account ing Office estimates the cost of the  bill to be no more than $188 million  per year, most of which will  result  from the continuation of health insur ance coverage for employees.  This bill is a reasonable approach. It  seeks  to meet  the needs of families  while  helping  businesses  plan  for  workers taking leave. An estimated 95  percent of all firms, those with fewer  than 50 employees, would be exempt  from  the  bill's  requirements.  The  Family and Medical Leave Act is not  antibusiness. Indeed, many firms that  already have  leave policies  in place  report improved employee loyalty, re duced turnover and absenteeism, and  enhanced productivity.  It seems clear that business owners  and their employees will benefit mutu ally from an unpaid leave policy such  as envisioned in this bill.  I urge my  colleagues and  the Nation  to  rally  behind  this  long-overdue  policy  to  help our Nation's families strike a bal ance between the needs of their loved  ones and  the demands of  the work place.e  e Mr~ ADAMS. Mr. President,  I am  outraged  that President Bush  has  vetoed the family and medical leave  bill and terribly disturbed that Con gress did not act to override the Presi dent's actions. I want President Bush  to know that he has not heard the last  from us on this issue. Those of use in  Congress who are profamily and who  want to give working America a help ing hand are going  to continue  the  struggle. The reintroduction today by  Senator Donn of the family and medi cal leave bill sends this message out  loud and clear.  I want my colleague  from Connecticut to know that as an  original cosponsor, I am behind him  all the way.  The family and medical  leave bill  that President Bush vetoed  simply  would have ensured that the mother  or father of a newborn child will have  a period of  time  to bond with that  child after birth and  that working  people in this country will not have to  sacrifice their jobs when their elderly  parents or their children are seriously  ill.  Families of America deserve no less  than required  in  this bill. President  Bush must understand that advocates  of family and medical leave will not let  up until this bill becomes Federal law.  He should also understand that the al ready overwhelming support for this  measure by the American public will  only continue to grow.  If we  cannot as a nation demon strate this kind of compassion for our  Nation's families, then I would like to  know how the President proposes to  face  the  tremendous  social,  demo graphic, and economic challenges we  must meet in the nineties.e  e ",1990
324,Senate,101,-0.37,828,16,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Today we send a  message-American women  do  not  have to die unnecessarily. Passage of  the Breast And Cervical Cancer Mor tality Act of  1990  is  another  step  toward ending the apathy and neglect  that have for too long marked our Na tion's attitude toward women's health  issues. Finally, we have said that we  are willing to bring the resources of  the Federal Government into the fight  against these terrible diseases, which  together claim more than 40,000 lives  a year.  I feel as though we have sent a get  well message to Marilyn Quayle and  the first  lady of Baltimore, Dr. Pat  Schmoke.  I am proud to have sponsored the  Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality  Act, along with 52 of my colleagues.  But I hope this bill will be remem bered not for our efforts, but for the  efforts of Rose Kushner, Jill Ireland  and Nina Hyde-all the women who  have  fought  the good  fight against  breast cancer.  To the end, they held within them selves a special kind of courage, that  carried them beyond their own  life and-death struggles and into the fight  for all woman's lives.  Like many woman, I was touched by  their selfless dedication. Their tireless  efforts  and  special  advocacy  for  women's health live on in the thou sands  of women whose  lives  they  saved. I would like to thank my col leagues for joining me in carrying on  their struggle.  Cervical  cancer  will  strike  over  13,000 women in 1990, most of them  poor. Breast cancer  is  this Nation's  second leading cause of death among  women-one in every ten women will  develop it in their lifetime.  Yet, even though an aggressive, com prehensive program can reduce breast  cancer  deaths  by  30  percent,  the  United States has had no such pro gram. Medicare will  not  pay  for  screenings, and in most States neither  will Medicaid. Women are dying need lessly because they do not have access  to basic medical services.  The Breast  and Cervical Cancer  Mortality Prevention Act begins  to  change that. It is an aggressive pro gram, combining education-both of  women and of health care profession als; payment for services; coordination  with private organizations; and proper  followup  in a single package. And it  delivers  these  services  to  the poor  women, who need_ it most.  The purpose of this bill is to ensure  that States with an inadequate avail ability of services and activities related  to breast and cervical cancer will be  better able to provide these services. It  is my hope that the Centers for Dis ease Control will take into account the  severity  of  the  problems  that  the  grants are meant to address and the  current  availability  of  services  in  awarding grants.  Further, it is my understanding that  the Centers for Disease Control has  always attempted to distribute grants  equitably  among  the principal geo graphic regions of the United States,  and it is my expectation that they will  continue to do so in implementing this  program.  This is a thorough and comprehen sive bill-we have seen what happens  when  the  system  doesn't  follow  through. My  clinical  lab  bill was  signed into law almost 2 years ago, yet  women are still dying from misread  pap smears.  And in New York City, 2,000 poor  women were tested for cervical cancer  by  the Department of Health. They  were never told the results. No news is  not good news for these women, some  of them may be dying.  The Breast  and Cervical Cancer  Mortality Act is a part of the larger  legislative package I introduced earlier  this  week,  The Women's Health  Equity Act of 1990. That package ad dresses  the wide  ranging  inequities  that still permeate our nation's health  care establishment.  Women are systematically excluded  from clinical medical studies around  the country. Women have to be sicker  than men before physicians will per form heart bypass operations-their  complaints are ignored. The U.S. Gov ernment's own National Institutes of  Health completely  ignore obstetrical  and gynecological research. As women  enter the 21st century, they are still  the victims of 14th century attitudes.  I am working to change that. With  this bill we have begun to send a mes sage to the Nation's health care estab lishment: we will not be treated like  second-class citizens.  ",1990

327,,101,-0.39,945,16,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am introducing the Small Business Tax Incen tive Act of 1990.  This bill contains several tax incentives for  small businesses, as well as provisions  to  make the Internal Revenue Service more re sponsive  to small business concerns  in  its  promulgation of tax regulations. This bill is in tended  to address  legitimate needs of small  businesses, but within the confines of current  budgetary constraints.  I would  like  to com mend our  colleague,  the Honorable NORM  S1s1sKY, who, as always has been instrumen tal  in advancing  the  interests of small busi nesses.   The bill which I am introducing today incor porates a proposal similar  to one originally  sponsored by the Honorable FRED UPTON and  the Honorable KWEISI MFUME in H.R. 3500 to  provide a new tax credit of up to $5,000 for  expenditures incurred by small businesses for  public  accommodations access.  I want  to  commend both of my colleagues for their bi partisan cooperation across  the aisle  to get  this done. This provision  is  intended  to pro vide  relief  for small businesses  that will be  faced with new obligatio.ns to make such ex penditures under the recently enacted Ameri cans With Disabilities Act. To offset revenue  losses from this provision, the existing cap on  deductions  for  removing  architectural  and  transportation barriers would be reduced from  $35,000 to $15,000.  The bill would also extend permanently the  25-percent deduction  for  health  insurance  costs of self-employed individuals. The current  provision is scheduled to expire after Septem ber 30, 1990.  In addition, the bill would require the Small  Business Administration  to comment  to  the  IRS on the impact of proposed regulations on  small businesses, and  the  IRS would be re quired  to consider these comments and dis cuss  them when  it publishes its final regula tions.  Finally, the bill contains a provision intended  to be of benefit to all taxpayers and to make  the Federal Government more accountable by  requiring  income  tax  instruction booklets  to  contain displays showing the sources and dis position of Federal  revenues. This proposal  was originally put  forward by our colleague,  the Honorable HOWARD WOLPE,  in H.R. 4555,  and  I commend him  for this useful contribu tion.  While my purpose in  introducing this bill  is  to provide  relief  for small businesses,  I am  also committed  that all  legislative  initiatives  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  must be revenue neutral in this time of severe  budgetary constraints. Mr. Speaker, in keeping  with my strongly held view on fiscal responsi bility,  it is my intention that if this small busi ness bill moves forward in the legislative proc ess, it would be fully financed in the course of  the normal budget reconciliation process.  Mr. Speaker, an explanation of the bill ac companies this statement.  EXPLANATION OF THE SMALL BUSINESS TAX  INCENTIVE ACT OF 1990 (H.R. 5455)  1. Treatment of certain expenditures in curred to make public accommodations ac cessible to disabled individuals <secs. 201 and  202 of the bill and sec. 190 and new sec. 43  of the Code).  PRESENT LAW  Under present law, a taxpayer may elect  to deduct certain architectural and trans portation barrier removal expenses for the  taxable year  in which paid or  incurred  rather than capitalizing such expenses: Ar chitectural and  transportation barrier  re moval expenses are defined for this purpose  as expenditures that are paid or incurred by  a  taxpayer  in order  to make facilities or  public  transportation  vehicles  owned  or  leased  in connection with  the  taxpayer's  business more  accessible  to  handicapped  and elderly individuals. In order for such ex penditures to be deductible under this provi sion, the taxpayer must establish to the sat isfaction of the Treasury Secretary that the  facility or public transportation vehicle to  which the expenditures relate conforms to  standards promulgated by the Treasury Sec retary with the concurrence of the Architec tural and Transportation Barriers Compli ance Board. The amount of the deduction  allowed under this provision for any taxable  year is limited to $35,000.  EXPLANATION OF PROVISION  Public accommodations access credit  In general  Under the bill, an eligible small business is  allowed an income tax credit of up to $5,000  for the amount of eligible public accommo dations access expenditures paid or incurred  during a taxable year. The credit is a gener al business credit and, consequently,  the  credit is subject to the rules of present law  that limit the amount of the general busi ness credit that may be used for any taxable  year.  Definition of eligible small business  An eligible small business is defined for  any taxable year as any person that is en gaged in the trade or business of operating a  public accommodation and that is required  by Federal law to make such accommoda tion accessible to, or usable by, individuals  with a disability if < 1) the gross receipts 1 of  the person for the preceding taxable year  did not exceed $1 million, (2) the person had  fewer than 15 full-time employees 2 during  the preceding  taxable year, and  (3)  the  person elects the application of the provi sion by claiming the credit for the taxable  year.  Definition of eligible public  accommodations access expenditures  Eligible public accommodations access ex penditures are defined as amounts paid or  1 The gross receipts of a person for any taxable  year are to be determined after reduction for re turns and allowances made during the taxable year.  For  this purpose, a full-time employee is defined  as any employee of the taxpayer who is employed  at least 30 hours per week for 20 or more calendar  weeks during the taxable year.  23073  incurred by a  taxpayer either < 1)  for the  purpose of removing architectural, commu nication, or transportation barriers which  prevent a public accommodation operated  by the taxpayer from being accessible to, or  usable by,  individuals with a disability, or  (2) for providing auxiliary aids and services  to individuals with a disability who are em ployees of, or using, a public accommoda tion operated by the taxpayer.  The amount of an expenditure is not to be  considered an eligible public accommoda tions access expenditure unless the taxpay er establishes  to  the satisfaction of  the  Treasury Secretary that the removal of any  barrier or the provision of any auxiliary aids  and services to which the expenditure re lates satisfies standards set forth in regula tions promulgated by the Treasury Secre tary with the concurrence of the Architec tural and Transportation Barriers Compli ance Board. In addition, amounts paid or in curred by a taxpayer for the purpose of re moving  architectural,  communication,  or  transportation barriers do not qualify as eli gible public accommodations access expendi tures if the amounts are paid or incurred in  connection with a facility that is first placed  in service after December 31, 1990.  Other definitions and special rules  For purposes of the credit provision, the  terms ""public accommodation,"" ""disability,""  and ""auxiliary aids and services"" are to have  the respective meanings given such terms by  the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990,  as in effect on the date of enactment of this  provision.  For  purposes  of  applying  the  $5,000  annual  limitation on  the amount of  the  credit and in determining whether the $1  million gross receipts limitation and the 15  full-time employee limitation are satisfied,  all members of the same controlled group of  corporations <as defined  in section 52(a))  and all persons under common control <as  defined in section 52(b)) are treated as one  person. Thus, for example, two or more cor porations  that are members of  the same  controlled group of corporations would be  allowed a credit that is not to exceed $5,000  if, treating all such corporations as a single  person, the $1 million gross receipts limita tion and the 15 full-time employee limita tion are satisfied for the preceding year.  In the case of a partnership, the $5,000  annual  limitation on  the amount of  the  credit is to apply at both the partnership  level and the partner level. Similarly, in the  case of an S corporation, the $5,000 annual  limitation on the amount of the credit is to  apply at both the S corporation level and  the shareholder level.  The bill also provides that to the extent  that a credit is determined with respect to  the amount of any expenditure, then no de duction or credit is to be allowed for such  amount under any other provision of chap ter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code and the  adjusted basis of any property with respect  to which the credit is determined is not to  include such amount.  Finally, the bill requires the Treasury Sec retary to prescribe such regulations as are  necessary to carry out the purposes of the  provision,  including  regulations  that < 1)  adjust the $1 million gross receipts limita tion and the 15 full-time employee limita tion in the case of taxable years that are  less than 12 months and (2) apportion the  $5,000 annual limitation among two or more  members of a controlled group of corpora tions  that are  treated as a  single person  ",1990
328,,101,-0.49,958,16,Mr. CLAY.," Mr.  Speaker,  our  colleague  FORTNEY PETE STARK, of California, was right  in both  instances  involving  the Secretary of  Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan.  Mr. STARK was correct in his public apology  on the floor of this House to Secretary Sulli van  for his  intemperate  remark about  race.  The race of the Secretary is not _the issue and  Mr. STARK sincerely regretted the unfortunate  inference.  Mr. Speaker,  the  issue  is  the quality of  health care for the poor, of whom a dispropor tionate number happen  to be black. On  this  issue Mr. STARK  is  imminently correct in this  criticism. of  the  Secretary  of Health  and  Human Services. It is not some random coin cidence  that  poor  and  black  people  just  happen to lack adequate, quality health care.  These citizens are victimized by  insensitive,  callous Government policies and Secretary  Sullivan is defending these policies.  Mr. Speaker, Secretary Sullivan is a person al  friend of mine, but I still  feel obligated  to  disagree with his professional positions  re garding the health care of impoverished Amer ican citizens. Specifically, his opposition  to  universal health insurance, which is based on  the economic theory that the market place will  resolve  our  health  care  delivery  problem,  poses a great problem for me. Almost 40 mil lion poor Americans-most of them depend ents of persons who work full  time, and dis proportionate number of whom are black and  Hispanic-have no access to adequate health  care service. The plight of  these 40 million  Americans does not bode well  for  the  free  market theory. These  individuals  live  in pain  longer and die earlier  than  those who can  afford  health  treatment.  The  free market  policy that Secretary Sullivan supports is not  reaching these 40 million Americans. How can  we be silent when millions of our brothers and  sisters are suffering this deprivation.  Mr. Speaker, I also disagree with the Secre tary's  public  position  regarding  a national  policy of family and medical leave. His insist ence that such a policy would be counterpro ductive inasmuch as it would make American  companies less competitive with foreign com panies, and force  jobs to move overseas,  is  not supported by the  facts. This same argu ment is repeatedly used by ultra-conservatives  in opposition  to every effort  to  improve  the  benefits of American workers. This argument  is seriously  flawed. Already, more  than 100  countries have national  family  leave policies  that far exceed the benefits stipulated in the  Family and Medical Leave Act which PresiAugust 3, 1990  dent Bush vetoed. Japan and Germany, our  major trade competitors, guarantee at least 3  months of paid family leave. U.S. businesses  would not be disadvantaged by a family leave  law. Mr. Speaker, I would think that the Secre tary of the Department of Health and Human  Services should be sensitive  to  the stress  problems created when a worker must choose  between a job and  taking  family  leave to be  present with  a newborn  child  or a dying  parent.  Mr. Speaker,  I was appalled  that six or  seven Members on the other side of the aisle  took to this well and attacked Mr. STARK  in  such a questionable manner. Each of  them.  expressed  indignation about a  racial  state ment and each proceeded to vote against the  Civil Rights Restoration Act which we passed  today. Apparently, some Members are more  indignant about a racial but not racist remark,  than they are about protecting the basic civil  and human  rights of Secretary Sullivan and  his fellow black citizens.  Mr. Speaker,  I hope  that Dr. Sullivan will  expand his one dimensional program regard ing medical care for minorities. I am afraid that  the perception so  far  is  that  if blacks and  other minorities just stopped smoking, all their  health problems would blow away.  DARE PROGRAM-PROVEN  EFFECTIVE  HON. ROBERT H.

329,,101,0.043,984,16,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  take this opportunity to draw the attention of  my colleagues  to a bill  I have  introduced  today, H.R. 5458,  the National Guard Alien  Enlistment Act.  This measure is the result of a careful eval uation and  revision of H.R. 3971,  legislation  granting  lawful  residence  status  to  certain  aliens enlisting in the U.S. Armed Forces.  H.R. 3971  is intended to alleviate the critical  manpower shortage currently  facing several  National Guard and Reserve units throughout  our Nation. On September 21, 1989, an earlier  version of  this measure was  the subject of  hearings before the House Judiciary Subcom mittee on Immigration, Refugees, and Interna tional Law.  In response to comments from the Depart ment of Defense,  the Department of State,  and  the  Immigration and Naturalization Serv ice, I revised the original legislation to narrow  its focus and making it more responsive to the  bill's original intent.  H.R. 3971 was the result of those revisions.  However, once again the legislation has been  revised based upon  the suggestions of  the  Defense Department.  This new measure is virtually identical to the  previous measure with three important excep tions:   First, the alien enlistment program would be  authorized for a limited period of 3 years, and  the Secretary of Defense will  report  to  the  Congress on  the success of  the program at  the close of the 3-year program.  Second, a limit of six States with a person nel strength of less than 95 percent,  instead  of 90 percent, of  the authorized strength of  that State's National Guard as of September  30, 1990, would be eligible.  Finally,  the  new  legislation would  allow  1,000 aliens, rather than 3,000, to enlist in the  National Guard each year  in  those eligible  States.  Mr. Speaker,  I am  requesting  that  the  full  text of H.R. 5458 be inserted at this point in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, and  I invite my  colleagues to cosponsor this measure.  H.R. 5458  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT ENLISTMENTS  IN THE NATIONAL GUARD FROM CER TAIN ALIENS.

331,Senate,101,0.013,1036,16,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President,  it  is  with regret that I respond to the com ments of my distinguished colleague  from Wyoming, because we have his torically been on the same side on SDI  debates. However, his comments  re flect several misconceptions about the  intent and provisions of this amend ment, which I feel compelled to clear  up.  First, I was opposed to any reduction  of the administration's budget request  for SDI. However, I receded to the ma jority view that defense cuts had to be  made and  that SDI should not be  immune to such cuts. In the past, I  have managed  the  floor debate on  behalf  of  the  proponents  of SDI  against attempts to cut back SDI. I be lieve that my record is clear on this  issue.  I agree with the Senator's desire to  see  the program produce an actual,  near-term defense capability. This is  why the amendment funds treaty-com pliant systems at the requested level  and provides almost $50 million in ad ditional funding for theater missile de fense systems. The need for the en hancement of our theater missile de fense work has never been more clear ly demonstrated than by the events of  the past few days.  I am concerned that we do not vio late the ABM Treaty process. If we de velop, test, or deploy a system contain ing space-based weapons, we  clearly  violate  the  treaty;  therefore,  the  amendment calls for deferral of de ployment of the Phase I system, con taining thousands of space-based bril liant pebbles, and adherence to the re strictions on development and testing  of space weapons.

334,House,101,0.287,1335,16,Mr. PARRIS.," Mr.  Speaker,  once  again, Federal employees have become  the scapegoats of our seriously trou bled budget process. Over and over  again, this country's civil servants are  threatened by the legislature tamper ing with their retirement funds, not  receiving cost of  living adjustments,  and  just plain  lack of  respect. The  most recent slap in the face is the pro posal to furlough Federal employees.  Does anyone really believe that it is  fair  to balance  the budget on  the  backs of Government workers?  Furloughing Federal employees for  up to 22 days is not simply a blow to  morale. Our Nation's 2.4 million civil  servants are paying mortgages, feeding  children, and working hard to enhance  their quality of life. And now we pro pose cutting them off at the knees by  taking chunks of their salaries to meet  budget constraints. Even a 2-day fur lough can have devastating effect on a  struggling worker or family.  I  can't  imagine  anything more  unfair to these dedicated people and  potentially damaging  to  the Federal  work force, and, in turn, the productiv ity of this country. At this moment,  Federal employees at the Department  of Defense are working night and day  to sustain our activities in the Persian  Gulf  crisis,  and other Government  workers are engaged in vital activities  all across the country. There are other  ways of solving our budget woes, and  we must find them but an extensive  furlough of essential employees is not  the way. I urge my colleagues to move  decisively  to  reach  a  responsible  budget agreement by October 1.  CONDOLENCES TO  FAMILY OF  U.S. AIR FORCE S. SGT.

345,House,101,-0.355,1504,16,Mr. SMITH of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of H.R. 4985, a bill  to  rename  the  Federal Building in Miami the Claude Pepper  Federal Building.  It was with a deep sense of personal  loss  that I, along with U.S. Congress, the State of  Florida,  and  indeed  the  entire  country,  mourned the passing last year of one of this  century's greatest Americans, Claude Pepper.  I knew Claude for 20 years, and it is impossi ble for me to imagine a more caring, dedicat ed, honest and loved man.  Claude Pepper began his 60 years of public  service in 1929, as a member of the Florida  State House. Claude went on  to become a  U.S. Senator from 1936 to 1951 and, finally a  Member of Congress  from  1962 until  his  death. Throughout his illustrious career, Sena tor Pepper served 1 O U.S. Presidents and  championed many noble causes-none as  dear to his heart, however, as the plight of the  elderly. This powerful commitment began not  when he became older, but at the very start of  his career. Sixty years ago, he sponsored a  bill to permit senior citizens to fish without a  license. Claude's deep  compassion  for all  people-seniors, children, and  the disadvan taged-came not from any political ambition  but from a deep and abiding love and heartfelt  concern.  As Senator Pepper grew older, he refused  to slow down. One could find him poring over  legislation, returning a constituent phone call,  fighting  for an  issue on  the House  floor. As  Time said of him in 1982, ""he is like a vintage  automobile with new parts: he keeps getting  better and more powerful with age.""  The  Federal  Building  in Miami  housed  Claude Pepper's district office  for over 20  years. It was here that he worked tirelessly to  improve the lives of both the young and old,  and  it  is here  that we should pay  tribute  to  him by renaming  the Federal Building  in his  honor. By  keeping Claude Pepper's name  fresh  in  the minds of the people of Florida,  the legacy of this wonderful human being and  patriot will grow for generations to come.  ",1990

347,House,101,-0.564,1543,16,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  introducing legislation to prevent im competent  and negligent physicians  from treating Medicaid patients. The  need for this legislation has been iden tified during the ongoing investigation  of the Medicaid Program being con ducted  by  the  Subcommittee  on  Human Resources  and  Intergovern mental Relations, which  I have  the  privilege  to chair. We conducted an  initial hearing in my home State of  New York, whose problems are similar  to  those of other States with  large  urban populations.  Our investigation is finding that sub stantial numbers of Medicaid patients  are  subjected  to  highly  dangerous  medical treatment by negligent or in competent physicians. Although I be lieve these physicians represent a very  small percentage of our Nation's doc tors, in a State like New York-where  only 15 percent of the licensed physi cians  treat Medicaid  patients-the  poor care provided by those few doc tors can wreak medical havoc on thou sands of patients.  In large urban areas such as New  York City, we have identified patterns  of poor care involving physicians who  are often educated  in Third World  countries and are certified to practice  by  a  loose State medical  licensing  system. These physicians are hired by  unscrupulous entrepreneurs to work in  shared health  facilities, more  com monly known as Medicaid mills. The  care provided by the worst Medicaid  mills is characterized by a wide range  of  improper practices,  including bla tant drug dealing, overutilization of di agnostic tests, and the failure to pro vide even minimal quality of care.  In New York City,  it is estimated  that there is a shortage of 500 physi cians in innercity neighborhoods with  large Medicaid-eligible populations. Of  the doctors who are available, most do  not provide the full spectrum of care  considered to be basic medical practice  in the United States. The majority of  these physicians lack board certifica tion or hospital affiliations, including  more than half of those who provide  care to pregnant women.  It is astonishing that some of these  physicians are  licensed and allowed  into the Medicaid Program in the first  place. But compounding the problem  is  the  inability or unwillingness of  Federal or State Medicaid authorities  to remove dangerous doctors from the  Medicaid system, even after their mal treatment of Medicaid patients has  been identified.  Financial fraud is treated more seri ously by State Medicaid agencies than  negligent medical care. More resources  are spent on fraud investigations than  quality of care reviews. Typically., phy sicians  excluded  from  the Medicaid  Program or delicensed by State boards  are removed because they committed  fraud. Doctors who practice poor qual ity of care are rarely disciplined with  more than a slap on the wrist.  Our review of all Medicaid physi cians referred to the New York medi cal licensing authority for disciplinary  action in 1987 and 1988 found that the  penalties recommended by the State  department of health had been dis missed or lessened in 40 percent of the  cases. Most of  these cases  involved  fraud. The most egregious quality of  care cases  investigated by the State  were not ref erred for discipline at all.  We also found that, of the few doc tors who are excluded from the Medic aid Program, most continue to practice  medicine and eventually return to the  program after the exclusionary period.  The Federal Government need not  condone the leninent treatment given  to dangerous physicians. We should  close the loopholes that allow incom petent physicians  to  treat Medicaid  patients. Today I am proposing reme dial steps that the Congress can adopt  to prevent truly incompetent and neg ligent physicians from treating Medic aid patients.  The Medicaid  Physician  Service  Quality Improvement Act of 1990 will  help State governments keep tabs on  incompetent doctors by requiring that  Medicaid physicians have unique iden tifying numbers for billing purposes.  Under this provision, the identifying  numbers of the physicians who actual ly treat Medicaid patients must be in cluded in the billing, thus preventing  incompetent  physicians  from  using  large health care  firms  to disguise  their participation in Medicaid.  The bill also requires foreign medi cal school graduates to pass a certifica tion exam already required for partici pating  in  the Medicaid Program  in  order to be eligible for Medicaid reim bursements.  To prevent the problem of unquali fied  doctors  providing  specialized  treatment to patients, the bill would  require that physicians providing pedi atric and obstetrical services either be  certified or hospital-affiliated in these  specialities, or have a consulting ar rangement with a physician who  is  certified or hospital-affiliated.  The  legislation would also  require  State governments to conduct quality  of care reviews of high-volume physi cians or health care plans.  Finally, my proposal would require  all State health care agencies to report  all adverse  findings  involving physi cians in the Medicaid Program to the  Federal Government, even when no  ",1990
348,,101,-0.465,1569,16,Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York.," Mr. Speak er, America is now spending at least $1 billion  a month  in search of peace  in  the Persian  Gulf. As we consider  the staggering military  cost of this crisis, we cannot ignore another  huge cost,  impossible to calculate  in dollars,  that Saddam Hussein's aggression has exact ed.  I am talking about the incredible amount  of human suffering endured by thousands of  hostages held against their will in Kuwait and  Iraq.  My heart goes out to the families of these  hostages who desperately scan the news re ports for clues to their loved ones' safety and  whereabouts. My constituents in Batavia, NY,  know this gruesome routine only too well. For  more than 5 years they have sought out every  morsel of news about the fate of their native  son, Terry Anderson, the longest held Ameri can hostage still in Beirut.  This week, on Wednesday, September 5,  1990, Terry Anderson marked his 2,000th day  as a hostage-a grim milestone  in captivity  described as ""a crucifying aloneness"" by the  recently freed Brian Keenan of Northern Ire land. From Keenan, held with Terry for about  8 months, we are given brief, heart-wrenching  glimpses of Anderson's life including  images  of Terry pacing the floor ""in his patched and  repatched and much more patched-but still  very holey-socks."" Keenan  tells how Terry  cherishes letters from his family as well as a  picture of his second daughter, Sulome, born  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  3 months after he was abducted on March 16,  1985.

349,,101,0.33,1569,16,Mr. BUECHNER.," Mr. Speaker, as much as  we may hear the term ""hero,"" once in a while  an act of true heroism will remind us how rare  a commodity heroism is. It is far more impres sive when the source of such an act is a mere  12 years of age. With this in mind, I rise today  in tribute to my constituent, Robbie Sanders of  Florissant, MO,  the boy-hero  from Mccurdy  Elementary, who recently received the Ameri can Automobile Association  [AAA] School  Safety Patrol Lifesaving Medal Citation.  Robbie Sanders had volunteered to partici pate  in his school's safety patrol, and  the  morning of October 11, 1989, marked only his  third day on duty in this responsible role. He  had just walked out into the street, arms out stretched to stop traffic so that several small er students could cross the street. As the stu dents entered  the crosswalk Robbie noticed  that an oncoming car was not slowing down  as it approached.  Rather  than simply avoiding  the car, and  thus  guaranteeing  his  own  safety, Robbie  quickly decided  to remove  the children  from  the car's path, putting his own life in danger.  He took two children  in his arms and pulled  them back to the curb while pushing the other  two students. They all reached the curb, nar rowly avoiding  the oncoming car.  In  those  brief seconds, Robbie saved the lives of these  small children.  The School Safety Patrol Program is an ex cellent  idea which provides a badly needed  service to the community. It helps in ensuring  the safety of younger children, while teaching  responsibility to the older children. The AAA is  to be congratulated for providing the lifesaving  medal citation and  recognizing students  for  their courage-students like Robbie.  Mr. Speaker, perhaps the most remarkable  thing about this  is  that Robbie, while partici pating in a program designed to teach him re sponsibility, has taught all of us a great deal  about courage and heroism. Accordingly, I ask  my colleagues to join me  in saluting Robbie  Sanders and all of the other recipients of the  AAA School Safety Patrol Lifesaving Medal Ci tation.  23697  COMMENDING THE COCA-COLA  co.

Divorce, drugs, and teen deaths are just  a  few of  the many obstacles  that we  read  about plaguing the lifeblood of our future.  Today, however,  I am not here to tell an other horror story.  Instead,  I am here to  tell  you about a program that has been started in  my district to help our children fight back. It is  called Good Grief Project.  The Good Grief Project is a joint effort be tween Hospice Care of Broward, Inc., and the  Junior League of Fort Lauderdale,  Inc.

But it was brought to my  attention before I left my office that I  had  received  a  letter  and  then  a  memorandum attached  to  it from a  Mr. William  B.  Corbett  in  Soda  Springs, ID, where he requested that I  read this to the U.S. Senate.  When I  looked at my remarks that  were prepared that we had worked on  yesterday and looked at his letter, I  thought maybe his letter was more ap propriate. His letter certainly is very  blunt, very direct, and in some ways  some Senators may take it that he lm pusns their motives slightly.  I would only say that, disregarding  those very blunt statements, I  think  there is a message in this letter that is  filled with basic common sense. And,  of course, the comman sense that is in  the letter, is that we do not need a tax  increase. What we need to do is spend  the same amount of money this year  that we spent last year and freeze the  budget and we would have a balanced  budget in a very short period of time  without putting any undue hardship  on any people in the country.  So  I would  just  like  to  read  letter from Mr. Corbett.  this  DEAR SENATOR SYIOIS: The following re marks concerning the present U.S. Budget  fiasco are directed to the entire U.S. Senate.  I would very much appreciate your reading  them before that full body.  Then his letter commences:  DEAR SENATORS: Let me begin by quoting  the  first paragraph  from  the October 6,  1990 Vol 18, No. 39 issue of the Pro Farmer  newsletter  published  by  ""Professional  Farmers of America Inc"".  ""Congress reaches a new low. We have fi nally reached the point where there are so  few statesmen looking after the welfare of  the nation as a whole, and so many back alley politicians who care only about buyfna  enough votes to be re-elected, that Coll81""es&  has lost its ability to govern at all.""  And also, please allow me to paraphrase a  statement made by Abraham Lincoln.  ""You can fool all of the people some of  the  time, and you can fool some of  the  people all of the time, but you cannot fool  all of the people all of the time"".  ,  It appears that fooling all of the people  all of the time is the goal of Congress, and  has been for many many years. There are  220 million plus citizens in this nation, and  perhaps you can fool 20 million of them all  of the time, but the rest are wise to you. I  am writing this memo on behalf of myself  and the several hundred million people who,  I am sure, like myself, are no longer fooled  by your shenanagans.  You make such a big deal out of  this  budget business.  I  suppose  that's to con vince us that you are really trying to do  something worthwhile; but I, and the sever al hundred million citizens that I am speak ing for, know that this budget ""crisis"" can  be solved very simply by freezing the new  budget at the current 1990  level for five  years.

352,Senate,101,-0.492,16,21,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I rise as one of the seven Senate mem bers of the conference committee on  the Civil Rights Act of 1990.  I want to say publicly that the dis tinguished Senator  from Utah has  done yeoman work  in attempting to  bring about a compromise in connec tion with this legislation. He has put  his heart and his soul into it. He has  made a good faith effort. Those who  are more strongly procivil rights than  some of the opponents of this bill have  also made a good faith effort. But the  fact  is  the President of  the United  States has been resolute in his opposi tion.  Having  commended my  colleague  from Utah for the magnificent effort  that he has put into this bill in trying  to bring about a compromise, I am dis appointed  that now  he  speaks  so  strongly against it. I am disappointed  that he tells his colleagues that they  should vote against this bill because  some little details in the bill are not  satisfactory.  I am disappointed to know, and he  tell us, that David Duke and George  Bush and ORRIN HATCH  are against  this bill. Maybe 60 percent of  the  whites in Louisiana did vote for David  Duke. Maybe  they will not vote for  this bill. But I believe the overwhelm ing majority of Americans would vote  .for this bill. I think passage of this bill  is the Senate's way, the Congress' way,  and, hopefully, the President's way of  saying we do not agree and are not  going to yield to the David Dukes of  America..  This conference report embodies the  will of a strong majority of the Senate.  More  importantly,  the  conference  report restores basic civil rights pro tection for millions of Americans.  Women and minorities were victim ized last year in a series of stunning  Supreme Court decisions. Those deci sions  turned back  the clock on our  progress  toward  equal  opportunity.  This bill rights those terrible wrongs  inflicted by the Supreme Court.  At the outset, I must commend Sen for his  leadership  in  connection with  this  legislation. He  has mastered the legal issues in the  bfil. He has spent hundreds of hours  negotiating with the White House and  educating his colleagues. Senator KENator KBlfflmy  NEDY's performance was  a  tour de  force. It is truly one of the finest legis lative efforts I have witnessed in my  tenure in the Senate.  He has been helped  immeasurably  by  Senator  JEFFORDS, my  ranking  counterpart on the Labor Subcommit tee. He deserves great credit. He has  been steadfast in his commitment to  restoring civil  rights protection  for  women and minorities. Many  in his  own party do not support that effort.  But with no reservation, no  lack of  courage, Senator  JEFFORDS  has put  principle above politics. And the same  I might say holds  true  for Senator  SPECTER who  has worked  tirelessly  seeking to fashion a consensus pack age.  It is a fact that we thought we had  worked out  that package. But  the  White House has been determined to  block a consensus. Those who have  the ear of the President have consist ently insisted upon the very last letter,  the very last comma, every single dot  over every i. So they come here today  threatening a veto.  Mr. President,  I do not  intend  to  review the intricate substantive details  of the conference report. By now the  arguments about such  issues as  the  burden of proof  in disparate  impact  litigation-things that people do not  understand-and the composition of a  pleading  alleging  a  discriminatory  group of practices are all too familiar  to those of us who deal with this type  of legalese. But 240 million Americans  do not understand it.  I will tell you who does understand  this bill: The people who are affected  by  this bill,  those who  have been  fighting for an equal share of opportu nity in this country, those who have  not been getting a fair share of the  action,  those who have suffe-red dis crimination over a period of years in  the history of our Nation. Yes,  they  understand it. They do not understand  the wordage. But they understand the  impact.  The real  issues at stake here are  issues of  integrity,  issues of  justice,  issues of fairness. I want to tell Mem bers of the Senate, in particular my  colleagues from Arkansas and Oklaho ma, that this conference report proves  again that the Senate has a sense of  integrity about it. It vindicates one of  the cardinal rules of the Senate, and  that is a Senator is only as good as his  or her word.  As we all remember last July when  we enacted  the Civil Rights Act of  1990, in the Senate, a number of Sena tors were  precluded  from  offering  amendments to the bill. The minority  leader acting fully within his rights  under postcloture procedure blocked  any efforts to improve the bill.  But the chairman of the Labor Com mittee  and  the  majority  leader  pledged that the conferees would fight  for  two particular amendments. The  first amendment by Senator PRYOR  would have made clear that a mere  statistical imbalance in the work force  is not sufficient to make out a viola tion of title VII. The second amend ment by Senator BOREN and others  would have set a cap on punitive dam ages at the greater of $150,000 or com pensatory damages.  Let me make this clear. I personally  oppose any cap on damages. I believe  that  the  jury or the court has  the  right to determine for itself or them selves what that amount should be. I  particularly resent a cap on damages  assessed against a person who has in tentionally  discriminated  against  women and minorities.  I  think it is fair to say, Mr. Presi dent, the majority of Senate conferees  oppose any imposition of any cap. At  the conference it became clear that a  majority of the House conferees vehe mently opposed any cap, as well.  Let us be  realistic. What occurred  was this: pledges have been made on  the  floor of  the Senate  to Senator  BOREN.  to Senator PRYOR, and  to a  group of other Senators  that  those  amendments would be provided for in  the conference report. And those of us  who were on the conference commit tee, even though we did not agree with  those particular amendments, felt that  we were honor-bound to make good on  those pledges. We  fought hard  for  that cap. We argued, we pleaded, we  cajoled, and, yes, it is fair to say that  we  twisted a few arms until we were  successful. We said to the civil rights  community  leadership, ""We made a  commitment, and you are in no posi tion  to  try to prevail against us,  to  keep us from living up to that commit ment.""  They were not in agreement, but the  good soldiers that they are, they rec ognized  that commitments made by  those who are leading the effort on  their behalf are commitments  that  have to be kept. I can tell you that our  efforts were not popular with many  advocates of  this bill or with our  House counterparts. They were not  popular with us, ourselves. But our  credibility was at stake, and  I  am  pleased to say that we honored the  pledges made to assert the will of the  majority of the Senate.  The pledge made on the floor of the  Senate by the majority leader and by  the chairman of the Labor and Human  Resources Committee was  kept.  I  think any caps on damages are un sound  policy,  but  the  conference  report includes both the Pryor and the  Boren amendments. Senators PRYOR  and BOREN and other Sena.tors who  were concerned about those particular  issues have a right to be comfortable  with this conference report.

354,Senate,101,-0.192,120,21,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Mr. President,  I  rise to support the passage of S. 2362,  the Insular Areas Recovery Act, with  amendments to the committee amend ments by myself and my  colleague  from  the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources, Senator McCLURE.  This  legislation was  initiated  in  re sponse  to  storm damage  repeatedly  suffered by our island territories,  in cluding the recent devastation caused  by hurricane Hugo  in the Virgin Is lands. Records of the Federal Emer gency Management Agency show that  there have been 39 disasters in the ter ritories in the past 20 years.  These frequent severe storms have  revealed a systemic problem in our na tional response to disasters in the is lands. The  islands  repeatedly suffer  severe damage from violent storms in  large part because they are not rebuilt  to  withstand  future  storms.   The  Nation currently has a policy of re building storm damaged areas to those  conditions which existed prior to the  storm. In areas of high storm frequen cy, such as the Caribbean and the Pa cific, this has resulted in a very costly  cycle of repeated destruction and re construction.  S.  2362 would help  to break  this  cycle by providing the President, and  the Governors of the Insular Areas,  with additional options for financing  hazard mitigation projects  so  as  to  harden  these  areas  against  future  storms. For a complete explanation of  the provisions of S. 2362, I ref er my  colleagues  to Senate Report 101-363  which sets forth the background and  recommendations of  the Committee  on Energy and Natural Resources re garding this legislation.  The committee reported S. 2362 on  July 12, 1990. However,  floor action  was not  initiated, at  the  request of  representatives in the Virgin Islands.  Given the lateness of the session, how ever, further delay in Senate passage  threatens enactment of  the bill and  the availability of funds to the islands.  Of particular concern are the authori zations for three programs contained  in S. 2362 and for which appropria tions  are  expected.  Unfortunately,  these funds cannot be expended with out the enactment of the authorizing  provisions included in S. 2362.  The  proposed  Johnston-McClure  amendments  would  make  several  modifications  to  the  committee  amendments as requested by the ad ministration. These modifications  in clude limiting the scope of the author ization under section 3;  limiting the  expansion of hazard mitigation assist ance under section 6, and providing  that  the  president may  require  a  matching contribution  for  such  ex panded assistance; and striking section  8 regarding loans from the Rural Elec trification Administration.  The Johnston-McClure amendments  to the committee amendments would  also add several Senate passed legisla tive provisions  to S. 2362. These  in clude  the provisions of S. 2841,  the  Omnibus Territories Act,  passed by  the Senate on August 3, 1990; and sec tion 12 of S. 247, authorizing the Ter ritorial Energy Assistance Program,  passed by the Senate on January 25,  further  details  regarding  these measures, I refer my colleagues  to  the appropriate  floor  statements  and committee reports.  Each  of  these  additions was  ap proved unanimously by the Committee  on energy and Natural Resources and  unanimously by the full Senate. Be cause  they  are  noncontroversial,  I  expect prompt action by the House of  Representatives. S. 2362 as amended  would address a range of issues includ ing hospital renovations; the disposi tion of excess Federal lands, an issue  which has been before Congress since  1984; and the authorization of a Terri torial Energy Assistance Program, as  requested by the island Governors to  help  them respond  to  their growing  petroleum dependence. Because of the  more complex  jurisdictional situation  in the Hoqse,  I understand that the  Interior Committee has worked closely  with other committees to reach agree ment on the enactment of these provi sions.  I  am certain  that Committee  Chairman UDALL, and the chairman of  the Insular Affairs Subcommittee, Mr.  DE Luoo, share my interest in meeting  the diverse needs of the islands which  1990.

With that  in mind. I would like to quote from the  Wall Street Journal:  World leaders have been wringing their  hands lately over the U.S. fiscal chaos and  soaring oil prices. But the leaders would do  well to pay more attention to the troubled  trade negotiation taking place in Switzer land. Those talks may hold the key to the  future of the global economy.  The stakes are huge. Even a moderately  successful conclusion  to  the  talks, being  held under  the auspices of  the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, would  spark a  $100  billion-a-year expansion  in  world trade, according to Gary Hufbauer of  the Institute for International Economics, a  Washington  think-tank. And  trade  repre sentative Carla Hills says  the U.S. could  enjoy a $200 billion increase in exports to  developing countries over the next decade.  The GATT talks are going to con clude  in  the next  several weeks.  I  think it is vitally important that Mem bers of this body should be very much  aware of what is happening, and be in  contact with the U.S. negotiators at  the GATT negotiations.

360,House,101,-0.088,172,21,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Chairman, we  have a responsibility to act. The committee has done a good job in bringing  before us a way in which we can act  and act intelligently.  I feel the greatest mistake this coun try ever made in any one piece of legis lation was  the 1981  tax bill, which  gave great benefits to large corpora tions  and  individuals who  are very  wealthy and got an undue gift from  the Federal Government.  Now,  lest  anybody  accuse me  of  being antirich, at one time when I was  a young lawyer in my firm we repre sented people like Alfred I. Du Pont,  Edward Bok, Charles Doering, among  the most wealthy people in this coun try. I never met one of them that did  not feel  like he should pay his  just  taxes. So do not bash the rich. The  rich are willing to make their proper  contribution. At the present time they  do not do so. This bill will make an  effort in that direction.  Finally, before I close, I want to say  to Members that all the tribulations  we  are having here  today are not  going to solve the fiscal situation of  our country. There is only one way in  which the fiscal situation in our coun try 1can be solved, and that is to elimi nate programs.  We have a lot of programs, and I am  not talking about reducing programs, I  am  talking  about  cutting out pro grams, even good programs. We had  an excellent opportunity  the other  day to cut out the arts and human ities. We also have programs like com munity development funds,  the mass  transit  funds,  and  things  like  that.  These programs are good programs  but are essentially local in nature. The  people  are  in  an  antigovernment  mood. They are antigovernment, and  have an antitax point of view. They do  not want to have big government.  We are not answering. The country  is not giving the answer that it should  to our constituents. The answer that  our constituents want is  less govern ment. They have a  right  to ask for  that. Thomas Jefferson, the founder  of our party, said those who are gov erned best are governed least.

362,House,101,-0.218,354,21,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Chairman, for the  first time in many years this Congress  is being asked to do something mean ingful about our Nation's budget defi cit and national debt. Along with the  President, we have resolved to make a  $500 billion  reduction  in  the deficit  over 5 years. This measure before us  tonight will accomplish that purpose.  In the midst of all of the controversy  surrounding  these  budget  delibera tions, this bill is a clear declaration of  our firm intention to make meaningful  reductions in spending as well as raise  necessary revenue in order to achieve  our goal.  As one of its goals, this bill intends  that the burden of deficit reduction  will be borne in a fair and equitable  manner among taxpayers. In order to  accomplish  that  goal  and  also  to  ensure  the progressivity of  the  tax  system, the plan contains a number of  provisions aimed at allocating a larger  share of deficit reduction to this Na tion's wealthiest taxpayers. These in clude measures  to burst the bubble,  raise the individual minimum tax from  21  to 25 percent, and to impose a 10percent surtax on individuals with tax able  incomes  over  $1 million. By  adopting  these measures, we are en suring  those  taxpayers most able  to  contribute in our effort to reduce the  Federal budget deficit will do so.  It also should be noted that this bill  does not include any increase in gaso line or petroleum taxes-even on home  heating oil. This bill does not impose  any limitation on itemized deductions.  It does not extend the Medicare hospi tal insurance tax to additional State  and local government workers.  Most important of all,  the bill re duces the Medicare Program by only  $43 billion, instead of the $60 billion  cut originally proposed in the budget  summit agreement. This measure will  protect Medicare  beneficiaries  by  keeping monthly premiums  low and  limiting the increase in the deductible.  At most, the reduction in payments to  providers will  reduce  the  rate  of  growth in a program which is growing  faster than any other portion of our  Federal budget. It is not inappropriate  for us to consider measures to control  these costs.  It is also important to point out that  this measure continues to offer special  assistance for rural hospitals. Over the  5 years of this budget plan, Medicare  will finally eliminate the unfair differ ential which causes rural hospitals to  be paid less for the same services than  urban  hospitals. We  cannot  assure  every rural hospital that this budget  will assure its survival, but this budget  gives them real hope for the future.  Mr. Speaker,  I am convinced  that  the only way we can make a real dent  in the budget deficit is  to take bold  steps. It won't be easy, and it will re quire us all to make some tough deci sions, but this Nation faces no more  important problem than reducing the  deficit. This situation scares the ad ministration. It scares  the Congress.  But we must do something  to deal  with it.

That Consti tution provides for three branches of  Government. Our branch of Govern ment is made up of representatives of  the people and  the way  that whole  representative process works  is  that  we represent the needs of our people  in the committee debate and through  our discussion we come to an under standing  of what  the  impact  of  changes  in  the  law will be on our  people, not on our process here, not on  the political ambitions of individuals,  but on people's lives.  Now, the provisions in theseamend ments have been discussed in my sub c0mmittee, in part, in small part, but  they have not been discussed for the  most part.  We cannot  tell even whether our  urban hospitals are going to be helped  or hurt by some of the things that are  thank the gentle being done, and we cannot tell in these  provisions what their impact will be  specifically on our communities and  the people we represent, and that is  wrong, Mr. Chairman.

367,House,101,-0.322,432,21,Mr. KLECZKA.," Mr. Speaker, when Congress  enacted the Financial Institutions Reform, Re covery and Enforcement Act  [FIRREA]  last  year, a principal purpose was to crack down  on  the highflying activities of savings and  loans chartered by Federal  regulators, and,  most  especially,  those  chartered  by  the  States.  That law placed prudent restrictions on the  ability of State chartered savings and  loans  which use Federal deposit insurance. The leg islation  limited  the amount of  loans  to one  borrower a thrift could make, limited direct in vestment in real estate and  junk bonds, and  set a reasonable standard for mortgage lend ing. In addition, it required the Federal Home  Loan Bank system, of which nearly all  thrifts  are members, to pay its fair share of the costs  of the FSLIC bailout.  Now, aided by some clever  legal advisors  and State  legislatures eager  to  take advan tage of Federal deposit insurance  for thrifts,  minus  the restrictions of FIRREA,  those es sential reforms could be scuttled.  To get out  from under  the  coverage of  FIRREA, some State chartered savings and  loans are simply converting  to an organiza tional  form known as a State savings bank.  This  relieves  them  from supervision by  the  regulator charged by Congress as the princi pal enforcer of FIRREA mandates for savings  and  loans,  the Office of Thrift Supervision,  and  raises  the possibility, depending on  the  prescriptions of the state legislatures involved,  of an exemption from certain FIRREA restric tions.  If a loophole  in FIRREA which allows  the  creation of State savings bank  [SSB]  is al lowed to stand, we may be setting ourselves  up for a repeat of the FSLIC disaster.  What could be the practical effect of a con version  from a State chartered savings and  loan to a state savings bank?  First, conversion  to a State savings bank  would remove them from the FIRREA ""loans  to one borrower""  limitation. This very  impor tant provision, which  requires  thrifts  to have  the same standard as national banks,  is es sential. Otherwise, State law could prevail for  State savings banks, which could mean that a  thrift could have most or all of its lending tied  up with one borrower, a very dangerous situa -tion.  Second, a State savings bank conversion  would allow institutions to  leave  the Federal  Home Loan Bank system, an option which  almost certainly would be exercised by certain  well capitalized thrifts. The problem with this is  that FIRREA required the Federal Home Loan  Banks, which are capitalized by the  thrift in dustry,  to pay  their share of  the bailout.  If  thrifts are allowed to leave at will, they will be  shirking  their contribution  to  that  fair share  payment. If the Federal Home Loan Banks do  not contribute  to  the bailout costs  the $300  million per year mandated by FIRREA,  those  costs will be shifted to the taxpayer.  Third, State savings banks would not have  to meet  the  ""Qualified Thrift Lender""  test.  This very modest provision of FIRREA  re quires  thrifts to have 70 percent of portfolio  assets invested in residential mortgage loans  and related qualifying  investments. Over and  over  during  consideration  of FIRREA, we  heard  that  the  thrift  industry needed assist ance due to the vital role it plays in mortgage  finance. The quid pro quo  involved  is  that if  there is Federal assistance, that mortgage fi nance effort must be maintained at reasona ble levels. This is not an unduly burdensome  requirement. For the quarter ending June 30,  1990,  the composite breakdown  for  the 47  State chartered Wisconsin savings and loans  shows  that approximately 73.8  percent of  assets were mortgage-related-66.3 percent  were mortgage loans and contracts, and 7.5  percent were mortgage-backed securities.  Fourth, FIRREA  limits Federal and State  savings and  loans  to  invest only up  to 400  percent of capital in loans secured by nonresi dential real property. Shifting to a State sav ings bank would lift this limitation.  In at least  one State, for example, State savings banks  are not now subject to any limitations on such  commercial loans. That can be expected to be  repeated.  Fifth, conversion of mutual  thrifts to stock.  OTS  regulations severely  limit  the ability of  mutual managers to purchase stock when a  thrift converts from a mutual  form of owner ship  to a stock  form. Converting  to a State  savings bank removes  this  restriction, which  opens the possibility to windfalls for well-situ ated managers.  Finally, conversion to a State savings bank  raises  the possibility  that  thrifts may exempt  themselves from FIRREA restrictions regard ing  the purchase of  junk bonds, a prospect  which  I know troubles greatly our colleagues  from North Dakota, BYRON DORGAN, The prin cipal author of the FIRREA junk bond provi sions.  I want to stress that not all of these circum stances would occur  in every State  if  this  loophole goes unplugged. Some States might  include restrictions in their laws. Others, how ever, might not. All States, however, would be  rolling the dice with Federal deposit insurance,  and the taxpayer could be asked, once again,  to pick up the tab for mistakes made at the  State level.  A handful of States have allowed for State  savings banks for some time.  Illinois,  Indiana  and Louisiana have enacted legislation since  the passage of FIRREA which allows their es tablishment. The Wall Street Journal reported  today that at least seven other States, includ ing California, Texas and Florida, are consid ering such  legislation. The Commissioner of  Savings and Loan  in Wisconsin  recently an nounced that he will propose such  legislation  next year.  Mr. Speaker, now is not the time for such  conversions. While there is indeed a need for  an overhaul of the regulatory framework, not  only for thrifts, but for banks and credit unions  as well, Congress cannot allow an evasion of  prudent safety and soundness rules  included  in FIRREA. Toward that end,  I will be joining  my Banking Committee colleague, Republican  BRUCE VENTO of Minnesota, in drafting legis 1ation  to plug  this  loophole before Congress  adjourns.  At  this point,  I would  like  to  insert  in  the  RECORD  the Wall Street Journal article  from  today which describes the situation.  [From the Wall Street Journal Oct. 16,  1990]  STATE LEGISLATURES MAY BE CREATING  LOOPHOLE FOR S&LS  (By Paul Duke Jr.)  WASHINGTON.-State  legislatures may be  opening a huge loophole that allows savings  and loans to evade the regulations placed on  them last year, federal regulators said.

368,House,101,0.256,445,21,Mr. CAMPBELL of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for  his point. I would note that this was  7.1 on the Richter Scale, but of excep tionally short duration. Had the Loma  Prieta earthquake been of the dura tion  normally  associated with  an  earthquake of that Richter Scale, we  would have had many more tests of  the proposition that structure deter mines damage. We were extremely for tunate. The next quake that will hit is  more likely to be along the fault struc ture immediately east of  the Bay. I  only look at that with great fear and  at other Cypress overstructures and  other instances where we perhaps are  not learning as quickly as we should.  There  is  another aspect which  is  very  important  in  the damage area,  less-so in the question of saving lives,  but that is are we adequately set up  with our Federal Government institu tions to deal with damage to historic  buildings.  Mr. Speaker, I regret to say my con clusion is we are not. Whereas I have  overall positive  things  to say about  FEMA and certainly nothing but posi tive things about the dedication of the  volunteers who work for FEMA and  gave so much of themselves, I am trou bled in a number of respects.  First of all, FEMA's attitude toward  historic buildings has been that the  restoration can be done so that it is a  serviceable building, but not necessari ly to the level that it is again restored  to the historic structure that it was as  well.  I am also troubled at the delay we  have encountered from FEMA. In my  own district, the Watsonville Hospital  is still awaiting determination whether  the damage to it will be compensated  by FEMA, and in my own district of  Scotts Valley,  a dispute  ranged  for  over 6 months between the Depart ment of Transportation and FEMA as  to who was  responsible  for damage  done to a bridge on a State highway.  Incidentally, at that point let me ap plaud the excellent work of Secretary  Sam Skinner who was on the very first  plane out to the bay area with Vice  President QUAYLE, and in a personal  meeting with me subsequently under took the responsibility of reconstruct ing the btidge in Scotts Valley.  In  moving  to  another  Federal  agency,  the Small Business Adminis tration, again my highest  regard  to  Susan Engeleiter,  the Administrator,  but let me observe some difficulties  with which she had to work.  D 2400  Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that the  limits on SBA loan insurance for an  individual are $100,000 for homes lost  by an individual? For a building of a  commercial nature, $500,000.  Mr. Speaker,  it perhaps does not  compel  as much  compassion  as  it  should when I make the remark that  $100,000 does not go very far in buying  a home in California. Sometimes that  statement  is greeted with  the com ment, ""Well, that is too bad. You are  too expensive out there."" But if you  bear in mind that people who, say, put  their life savings into a home and then  with our rapid appreciation in value  might seen an investment of $30,000  become $100,000 in the space of a year  or two, and. that is actual history in  terms  of  the property values,  you  would suddenly find your ability to re build the home you had far, far con strained by  reason of  the $100,000  limit.

370,,101,-0.448,588,21,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I want to inform  my colleagues  that Dearborn, Ml, welcomes  with pride the fall conference of the American  Consulting Engineers Council  [ACEC]. The  council, a federation of 51 State and regional  councils, is a national professional association  representing over 5,000 private-practice con sulting firms which employ 160,000 engineers,  scientists, technicians, and others who annu ally design over $100 billion  in constructed  public works and private industry facilities.  The members of ACEC have been  instru mental in designing infrastructure and cleaning  up asbestos and hazardous wastes  in all of  our districts. Roads,  bridges,  tunnels,  and  other water  treatment  facilities are all de signed by consulting engineers.  Despite  the  fact  that America's consulting  engineers design virtually every  facet of the  United States constructed environment, over  35 percent of the Nation's population believes  that engineers drive  trains, manage  boiler  rooms, or simply do not know the importance  of the engineer to  the American way of life.  This is why I am bringing their important work  to the attention of my colleagues.  Imagine waking  up  in  the morning  and  reaching for a glass of cold sludge. Engineers  design the systems that bring pure water into  our homes. They also build the systems that  enable us  to control  the  temperature of our  homes and offices, clean up hazardous waste  sites, and construct buildings  that will with stand the forces of storms and earthquakes.  We  rely on consulting engineers  for our  quality of life. They have their work cut out for  them in restoring our transportation infrastruc ture. Nearly one-half of all bridges  in  the  United States do not meet minimum safety  standards. By  the year 2000, approximately  7.5 billion gallons of gasoline will be wasted  October 16, 1990  due to traffic congestion alone. The last major  airport constructed in this country was opened  15 years ago,  in spite of the fact that there  has been a dramatic increase in airline traffic  since deregulation 12 years ago. The need to  improve our infrastructure is outlined in numer ous studies which show that increased spend ing on infrastructure translates directly into in creased productivity. Consulting engineers will  do the design work to make the necessary im provements.  Consulting engineers also make a valuable  contribution toward lowering our trade deficit.  The overseas design and construction  indus try accounts for $24.5 billion  in development  projects. Studies show that if U.S. engineering  firms design a project overseas, generally the  construction  and machinery  also  originate  from  this country. The design  industry has  been able to maintain  its share of the world  market, in spite of growing competition.  Mr.  Speaker,  these  impressive  achieve ments have been accomplished by an industry  in which four out of five are small businesses.  We can be proud that the small business spirit  is so strong  in our country.  I  join my col leagues in the Michigan delegation in welcom ing these fine individuals to our State.  MRS.  ANNA  GREENBERG  RECEIVES  GREAT  AMERICAN  TRADITIONS AWARD  HON. C. THOMAS McMILLEN  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 1990  ",1990
371,,101,-0.214,588,21,Mr. MCMILLEN of Maryland.," Mr. Speaker,  on Wednesday, October 18,  the B'nai B'rith  Foundation will present  its Great American  Traditions Award to Mrs. Anna Greenberg of  Annapolis.  Mrs. Greenberg will receive the award as a  result of her years of service to her communi ty, not only  in Annapolis, but wherever she  has lived throughout the world. Recipients of  the award are a part of a select group of  American citizens, who, through their dedica tion to their community serve as role models  to young people.  Through her dedication  to both education  and  the arts  in Annapolis, Mrs. Greenberg's  dedication  to voluntarism has made her the  first women  from Maryland  to  receive  the  award. A native of Annapolis, Mrs. Greenberg  has made many important contributions to her  hometown through her work for the Annapolis  Fine Arts Committee, the Annapolis Sympho ny Orchestra, St. John's College,  the Anne  Arundel General Hospital, the resource coun cil, and the junior league, in addition to being  a  teaching guide  in historic Annapolis. Mrs.  Greenberg's dedication to Annapolis and  the  State of Maryland earned her statewide ap preciation when she was named to the Gover nor's Council on Voluntarism.  Mrs. Greenberg is an asset to the Annapolis  community, and her dedication to voluntarism  is an example to us all.  I congratulate Mrs.  Greenberg on  this occasion, and hope  that  many young Americans will follow in her foot steps as dedicated, active citizens.  ",1990

I think  those who are on the committee, in  the atmosphere  in which we work,  work very well together, with concern  for the best interests of the country.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of  this authorization for the intelligence  community for the next year. I would  encourage my colleagues who have not  made it available to themselves to go  to H.R. 405 of the Capitol and look at  the Classified Annex which is avail able  to Members of Congress  to see  what it is that some of these funds are  expended for.  As was mentioned earlier, it is diffi cult and I guess  impossible to speak  about some of the things that are in  the budget for intelligence authoriza tions. I think it is very important that  Members look at what is happening in  terms of reality and what is happening  in terms of, I think, responsibility by  the intelligence community, and cer",1990

374,House,101,-0.514,705,21,Mr. KASTENMEIER.," Mr. Chair man,  I  thank  the gentlewoman  for  yielding me this time.  I  rise  in  support  of  the Boxer  amendment.  I cannot say  that it  is  technically  legal  or parliamentarily  perfect or not, nor can I say that the  chances of it ultimately becoming law  are more than very slight. However, it  does one thing. It does get to the heart  of the matter. Even more so than the  3 hours that we spent on Angola, be cause it is a question, the principle in volved here. The question of policy is  so profound, so significant, that really  all other questions we have debated  today pale in comparison.  It has  to do with  the  relevancy,  really, of  the Committee on  Intelli gence, raised by the gentleman from  Illinois [Mr. HYDE] earlier. How rele vant is our committee? It has to do  with whether or not Congress  can  make any meaningful contribution in  terms of national security or interna39-069 0-91-23 (Pt. 21)  tional security questions. What is our  limitation?  Now, I say this, knowing that since I  have been on the Committee on Intel ligence and the Committee on Intelli gence has been operating in a number  of years under what I consider superb  chairmanship,  including  the  gentle man from Massachusetts, Mr. Boland,  the  gentleman  from  Indiana  [Mr.  HAMILTON], the gentleman from Ohio  [Mr. STOKES], and now my colleague,  the gentleman from California  [Mr.  BEILENSON]. That is not the problem.  The problem is our constitutional limi tation, our total inability to do any thing more than to listen up in room   H-405. When proposals are made by  the executive branch, you  listen  to  them. We cannot speak of them. We  cannot  effectively  challenge  them.  There is no vote, normally, on those  propositions, and  there  is no  third party interest.  D 2050  Except in the most rare  instances,  we hear from the intelligence agencies  only  and  the  executive branch on  these proposals.  There are ways, it has been pointed  out,  that could be  challenged. We  could,  and  it was once done by  a  former Member, Mr. Boland,  chal lenge Central American policy; very  painful, very difficult, once in recent  years.  We can with this particular vehicle,  the authorization bill which contains  money, although we  customarily as  you know do not, we can challenge cer tain policies. Today we have in two or  three particulars, mostly by Members  not now members of the Intelligence  Committee.  Iran-Contra, cited by the gentlewom an from San Francisco, is very much  in point. We have seen Judge Walsh  give up the prosecution this last week.  We have seen little come of it because  the  juxtaposition  of  the  executive  branch and the Congress is at a terri ble disadvantage to the Congress. We  literally have been unable, we cannot  even get a suitable notice provision out  of Iran-Contra. The gentleman from  New York [Mr. McHuGH] has worked  desperately hard for 3 years, frustrat ed at every point, to get a notice provi sion. You would  think we  could at  least get that out of the scandal of the  executive branch in terms of a nation al security question, and we cannot.  So I say a vote for the gentlewom an's amendment is a vote for a new  look at how Congress and the execu tive branch can handle intelligence in  the 1990's.  ",1990
375,House,101,-0.44,705,21,Mr. BEILENSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume. I rise in opposition to the gen tlewoman's amendment.  Mr. Chairman,  I  understand  the  desire of my colleagues,  the gentle woman from California [Mrs. BOXER]  and  those who support her amend ment to ensure the congressional over sight of  intelligence activities  is  as  strong  as  possible. That  is  a  goal  which the members of the Intelligence  Committee share. In fact, it was the  primary  reason  for  the creation of  these committees 13 years ago.  Congress currently has in place ef fective tools for conducting oversight  of the operation of our intelligence ac tivities. These tools Which are applica ble to covert action programs, as well  as  to all other intelligence activities,  include regular monitoring by the in telligence Committee of the conduct  of ongoing programs and the exercise  by our committee and the Committee  on Appropriations of the power of the  purse.  One of  the  results of  the  Intelli gence Committee's use over the past  few years of the authority it has over  funding decisions has been a signifi cant  reduction  in  the  amount  of  money available to initiate covert ac tions, which  I believe has had  the  effect of ensuring a much more judi cious approach  in decisions by  the  President as  to when to apply  that  particular foreign policy tool.  Obviously,  improvements could be  made  in  the congressional oversight  system, and our committees regularly  engage in working with the adminis tration and with the Senate to develop  changes on which both branches of  Congress can agree.  As I mentioned in my opening re marks on the bill itself some several  hours ago, I expect that this year that  process  will  produce  some  badly  needed improvements both in quantity  and quality of the information given  to Congress when it is notified of the  initiation of a covert action. Those im provements include requirements that  findings be  in writing,  that they be  contemporaneous with the decision to  initiate a covert action, and that they  clearly specify  if the involvement of  non-U.S. Government  third  parties  and agencies other than  the  intelli gence agencies is contemplated. These  changes will not satisfy everyone, es pecially those who have reservations  about the wisdom of covert action pro grams under any circumstances, but  they  are  precisely  the  procedural  changes  recommended by  the  Iran Contra committees. That is what they  recommended. They did not  recom mend  the provisions  in  the amend ment of the gentlewoman from Cali fornia [Mrs. BOXER].  The provisions  they  recommended  are in the Senate bill and will, I hope  and trust, be approved by the confer ence  committee  between  our  two  Houses in the near future, and I be lieve  that  they  represent  the most  that  can be achieved, certainly  this  year.

385,,101,-0.278,952,21,Mr. GAYDOS.," Mr. Speaker,  there  is  little  doubt that funding for education. especially for  higher education  through student assistance,  is one of the critical  issues facing us  today.  What's more,  with  reauthorization  of  the  Higher Education Act of 1965 coming up next  year,  it  is  likely  that the debates on student  aid, both loan, and grant programs, will inten sify.  One of the elements of the debate focuses  on providing assistance for middle income stu dents who are increasingly not eligible for the  more  traditional Stafford Guaranteed  Loan  Program and the Pell Grant Program.  Another element focuses on finding ways of  realistically controlling student defaults in  the  loan programs, with a special emphasis on  those students in the career training sector of  higher education.  Today, I want to address those issues. First,  I will touch on a singular effort by Pennsylva nia's State  treasurer. Catherine Baker Knoll,  to support a special loan program in the Com monwealth primarily for students from middle and upper-middle-income families.  Then  I will describe a new program devel oped by a career  training school as a step  toward  guaranteeing  repayment  of  student  loans.  And,  finally,  I will  focus on some positive  contributions that career training schools, their  faculties, and  their students. make  to  their  communities.  Just a short while ago, a unique agreement  was reached between the Pennsylvania treas urer and  the State's designated guarantee  agency  for  the  title  IV  student  loan  pro grams-the Pennsylvania Higher Education  Assistance Agency-that will ensure the con",1990

388,Senate,101,0.551,1173,21,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, I won dered if our time here tonight was well  spent. The distinguished Senator from  New York has told us that on this vote  we reelect the President. If we do that,  we are doing the Lord's work, and I re joice in being part of it.  Mr. President, we have had a refer ence here to the budget process being  an oxymoron.  Mr. President, I submit if we went  out to any household in America we  would  find  that  they had a budget  process, and that budget process would  not be an oxymoron. I submit that in  any business in America, be it large or  small, they have a budget process that  is not an oxymoron.  In fact, we stand on the single spot  in the United States of America where  budget process is an oxymoron, and as  a result we are the laughing stock of  the Nation.  Mr. President, it is interesting that  after all of these remarks, we are fi nally debating, in my humble opinion,  the one part of the bill that I know is  in the interest of the people who do  the work, and pay the taxes, and pull  the wagon in this country.  Mr. President, let me outline the so called outrages we are talking about in  this amendment. The first outrage is  that we have three caps on spending  each year for 3 years, and what the  cap says is if you violate that cap, 15  days after you pass the spending bill  there  is  an across-the-board adjust ment that cuts spending back to the  level  that you said  in  law  that you  would adopt.  Mr. President, if that were submit ted to a vote of the working people of  this country, it would be adopted by  an overwhelming margin.  I hear our colleagues say there is no  enforcement,  there  is no  sequester.  Mr. President, we have more seques ters in this bill, more enforcement in  this bill by far than we have ever had  before. We have three caps that are  absolutely enforced with a mandatory  offset. We have a  sequester for  the  first time on entitlements and under performing  funding  measures. We  have  the Gramm-Rudman sequester  process strengthened with an ironclad  enforcement.  Mr. President, what we are trying to  do here  is  to do something that we  have all been concerned about. It is  easy to make promises, it is easy to  write budgets. It is very hard to live up  to  those promises  in  those budgets.  There is no  ironclad guarantee. You  cannot build legislatively a four-sided  fort where you can draw  the draw bridge up and go back to sleep. But  what we have here  is  the strongest  process we have ever had before, a  stone wall to our back in the gunfight  of those who really want to do some thing about spending.  Mr. President, I have heard the lan guage stretched to the breaking point,  but how anybody could possibly be lieve  that  by  having  binding  con straints on spending, we move  this  great Republic  toward  the financial  crises of Argentina, I find that totally  incomprehensible, and obviously I do  not believe it to be the case.  Let me say, Mr. President, that the  current vehicle that we operate on, as  imperfect as it is has worked. Let me  remind my  colleagues  that  before  1985, when on the floor of the Senate  we adopted the Gramm-Rudman-Hol lings balanced budget law, the 20 years  prior to the adoption of that law saw  Federal spending grow by 11 percent a  year.  With all of its failings since that law  went into effect, Federal spending has  grown by half of that rate. The Feder al Government was spending 23.9 per cent of GNP the day that law passed.  Today  the Federal Government  is  spending 22.4 percent of GNP.  And let me let you in on a secret.  With  this agreement fully enforced,  with moderate growth at least 80 per cent of the level we have achieved in  the last 6 years, Government spending  as a percentage of GNP in 1995, at the  end of that fiscal year, will be 18.3 per cent, 24 percent smaller than it was  when Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was  enacted in 1985.  Mr. President. I ask for 1 additional  minute.  ",1990

390,House,101,-0.007,1446,21,Mr. HUTTO.," Mr. Speaker, there is  much frustration throughout America  and there is much frustration here in  the Congress. We must get a budget.  We started the process night before  last, I think, with a good budget reso lution.  When many of us voted against the  resolution a week or so ago, and  it  went down overwhelmingly with votes  on both sides of the aisle, two of the  major points for voting against it were  the hard hits on Medicare and our  senior citizens, and also the onerous 10  cents a gallon on gasoline. We correct ed that in the budget resolution which  passed this House of Representatives  night before last.  It appears that the other body does  not want  to do anything about  the  bubble and taxing the higher income  and wealthier Americans.  I  think most people feel that it is  the right thing to do, to have an equi table distribution of this burden; so I  hope that before we go home, that we  will have done the right thing for all  our constituents and place this burden  where  it belongs. None of us  likes  taxes, but we need to place it in the  right places, and I believe this House  has taken the right step in doing that.  I  hope  the other body will  follow  through.  HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD  STAND TALL  (Mr. HEFLEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute, and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1990
391,House,101,-0.766,1446,21,Mr. WASHINGTON.," Mr. Speaker,  this morning  the President has  the  civil  rights bill on his desk. Under  American  law,  there  is  a  universal  standard. Whomever claims something  to be true must prove that thing to be  true, not claim it, prove it. If the civil  rights bill is a quota bill, then why do  not those who claim it is a quota bill  prove that it is a quota bill and stop  hiding behind that?  If there is a veto of this bill, I think  the President, Mr. Speaker,  should  send a clear message to the American  people. It would only  take  three or  four  sentences  to  explain how  and  under what circumstances  this won derful bill is a quota bill. In plain Eng lish, they ought to be able to prove it.  Mr. Thornburgh and Mr. Gray have  between them, Mr. Speaker, 61 years  of experience in practicing law. Surely  they can come up with more than con clusions  that  this  is  a  quota  bill.  Surely they can come up with three or  four sentences, Mr. Speaker.  They are giving the President bad  legal advice. There is no in between.  There is no crying wolf.  The President has said, Mr. Speaker,  that we should read his lips. He said  he wants  to sign a civil  rights bill.  There is only one man in the mirror,  Mr. Speaker. His mouth moves so fast  . I cannot hear him, but I can see what  he does, and what his actions do say  that he does not want a civil rights  bill,  and what  he  does  speaks  so  loudly, Mr. Speaker,  I  cannot hear  what he says.  CORRECTING THE SYNAR  AMENDMENT ON GRAZING  (Mr. RHODES asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute, and to revise and extend his  remarks.)   ",1990
392,House,101,0.407,1446,21,Mr. RHODES.," Mr. Speaker, I hope  the Chair and the House do not mind  if I change the subject for at least a  brief moment.  On Monday  the House considered  the Synar amendment which affected  grazing fees charged to graze cattle on  BLM lands. I think many Members of  this House based their vote on repre sentations of fact  that were  inaccu rate. Among the things that the gen tleman from Oklahoma [Mr. SYNAR]  used to press his argument were fig ures relating to grazing fees charged  by States to allow grazing on State owned  lands, and among  the States  the gentleman quoted was the State of  Arizona, where he said the State of  Arizona charges $5.99 per animal unit  month to graze on State lands.  Mr. Speaker, I am today inserting in  the RECORD a letter from the commis sioner of the Arizona State Land De partment which states that in fact in  1990  the  fee  charged  is  $1.39  per  animal unit month, and the highest  fee ever charged since 1950 was $1.43.  I do not think the gentleman from  Oklahoma  [Mr.  SYNAR]  deliberately  ",1990

394,House,101,-0.502,1459,21,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Chairman,  thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  let me make  this  point: The  Jackson-Vanik  provision  worked in the Soviet Union. It contrib uted mightily to bringing the Soviet  economy to its knees and its political  system to its senses.  Even  today  in China  they occupy  the  country  of  Tibet,  committing  atrocities  that  far  exceed  anything  that the Soviet Union ever did in Lith uania. Even today the Chinese are still  engaging in relations with the Iraqis,  helping them in their chemical weap ons program. We cannot allow that to  continue. They have had an ongoing  program  of  cooperation with  the  Iraqis in the development of the Is lamic nuclear bomb which could be  used against all civilization, the Israe lis and the American soldiers.  As  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  pointed out,  they have continued to  repress their country, executing over  500 people just in the last year for po litical purposes.  This is not liberal-conservative, it is  not Democratic-Republican. The gen tleman from New York [Mr. SOLOMON]  is correct, and he should deserve and  receive our support on the floor today.  ",1990
395,,101,-0.402,1576,21,Mr. COLEMAN of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker,  today I am introducing legislation for the relief  of Mr. Marcelino Serna of El Paso, TX. My bill  would make Mr. Serna eligible for the award  from the Army of the Congressional Medal of  Honor by stipulating that the regulation which  says that a nomination for that award must be  filed within 2 years of the acts ""above and  beyond the call of duty"" should be waived in  this case. In my judgment, Mr. Serna deserves  that medal just as surely as anyone who has  ever been so honored.  Marcelino Serna served  in  the U.S. Army  from 1917 to 1919. He was born in Chihuahua  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  City,  in  the Mexican state of Chihuahua,  in  1896. He  is now 94 years old and has held  U.S.  citizenship  since  1924.  Seventy-one  years ago, Mr. Serna was awarded the Army's  second highest award for valor in combat, the  Distinguished Service Cross. He was decorat ed with the highest military medals of Italy and  France. The descriptions of his exploits on the  battlefields of Belgium and France read  like  casebooks of heroism.  In  recovering  from  wounds suffered toward  the end of the war,  he was personally decorated by Gen. John  ""Black Jack"" Pershing.  Some have speculated that Mr. Serna was  not award the Medal of Honor either because  he was a buck private for most of the war, be cause he was not a citizen of this country at  the time, or because he could not speak Eng lish well.  I hope that none of these reasons  was ever given by anyone in a position of au thority in these matters. They are insulting and  they have no basis in law.  This bill, once enacted, would begin to right  a wrong-and to correct an oversight.  I urge  the committee of jurisdiction  to  take up  the  legislation as rapidly as possible so  that the  Army may look at the merits of this case.  AN  INTERESTING AND PROMIS ING RECYCLING INITIATIVE  HON. FRANK HORTON  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 18, 1990  ",1990
396,,101,-0.004,1576,21,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  call attention to an  interesting and promising  recycling  initiative undertaken by  the Green  Bay Packaging Co., the Xerox Corp., and IBM.  These  three companies have developed a  practical use for recycled waste office paper.  The product  is called Eco-White and  it  is  used  in  the manufacturing  of  cardboard  boxes. At the request of Xerox and  IBM,  the  Green Bay Packaging Co. developed a proc ess to convert used office paper into the white  linerboard material used as the outer surface  layer of corrugated shipping containers.  American companies  throw away an esti mated 4.5 million tons of office waste paper  each year. Eco-White could put a substantial  dent in that figure. It draws its supplies from a  market which has only been minimally tapped  since only 5 percent of offices in this country  are currently  involved  in  recycling programs.  One hurdle preventing more firms from partici pating  is  the  lack of demand  for  recycled  fibers. Eco-White will create that demand.  Furthermore, the repulping process used to  turn copier paper into Eco-White is better for  the environment. By avoiding de-inking,  the  process  saves 25  percent of energy and  water use and results in a 200-percent reduc tion in solid waste.  Perhaps  the most important aspect of the  Eco-White process is  that  it  is private-sector  driven. Eco-White is an example of what can  be accomplished by the private sector when  left to find their own solutions to a burgeoning  problem.  I would like to salute the three corporations  responsible for this product: Xerox,  IBM, and  the Green Bay Packaging Co. By working toOctober 18, 1990  gether  to address  the solid waste problem  which confronts not just them, but all Ameri cans, these three have performed a valuable  public service.  It is not surprising that two of these compa nies, Xerox and IBM, are winners of the Mal colm Baldridge Quality Award.  Both  firms  needed  to demonstrate an exceptional com mitment to quality in order to win this distin guish award. With  the development of Eco White, it is apparent that both are as commit ted to public service and the environment as  they are to quality.  BETTY T. EGAN  HON.

397,,101,-0.321,1576,21,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, on the oc casion of National Business Women's Week, I  would  like my colleagues to join me  in con gratulating Betty T. Egan, who was  recently  chosen Santa Fe Business Woman of  the  Year by the Capital City Business and Profes sional Women.  Widowed as a young mother, she followed  her dream of  life  in  the West  to Santa Fe,  where she founded Rancho Encantado in Te suque north of the city. It has grown into one  of the major resorts in the Southwest  Mrs. Eagan was the first woman fire chief in  the country as head of the Tesuque Volunteer  Fire Department. A grandmother  for many  years,  she  is  credited with  fostering  the  growth and continued educational excellence  at Tesuque Elementary School.  She  is an active member of the American  Red Cross, and is one of only two women to  serve on the American Hotel and Motel Asso ciation resort committee. She has become a  familiar figure in the Santa Fe community, and  is an  inspiration to many of our young busi nesswomen and working mothers.  Mr. Speaker, as we salute working women  this week,  I suggest  to my colleagues  that  Betty Egan is a superior example of success  and grace in adversity.  DAWN GOERING A  SUPERWOMAN  HON.
