            "4": "H52  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE January 6, 2011  b1020  THE TRAGEDY AT MILLARD  SOUTH  (Mr. TERRY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I want to  follow up with my  colleague JEFF  FORTENBERRY\u2019s thoughts.  The school  in my district, Millard  South, endured the ultimate tragedy  when a student, who was suspended, returned with a gun. He walked into the  assistant principal\u2019s office and  shot  her. Ms. Kaspar later died.  My profound  sorrow of  this  incident\u2014the ultimate parents\u2019 nightmare.  My kids attend that school district; so  we were getting the call about the  lockdown. I don\u2019t think there is anything more disturbing to a parent anywhere than when the veil of safety of a  school has been pierced by such violence.  The principal, who was also shot, is  going to survive. He is also a neighbor  of ours, and so I am glad that he will be  fine.  I ask this floor and our colleagues on  both  sides of  the aisle  to  join  the  Omaha community in expressing the  depth of our sorrows. I ask for your  prayers for not only the students of  that school but for all of the teachers,  for the family of the assistant principal  who died, and for the principal who is  fighting for his life right now. I appreciate everyone\u2019s concern.  f  THE HYPOCRISY OF THE  ELIMINATION OF PAYGO  (Mr. MORAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. MORAN. Horrible tragedies like  that cited by the two previous speakers  remind us that there are simply too  many guns too readily available to too  many children. It has got to stop.  On a very different subject, though,  Mr. Speaker, when Ronald Reagan ran  for President, he said that any President who does not submit a balanced  budget should be impeached. He never  did balance a budget. In fact, the only  times that our budget has been balanced was during the Clinton administration as a result of what is called  PAYGO\u2014that  you  don\u2019t  increase  spending without  increasing  a  concomitant amount of revenue; and you  don\u2019t cut taxes without immediately  cutting the same amount of spending.  That worked. We had three successive  years  of  budget  surpluses,  and we  passed on a $5.6 trillion projected surplus to the Bush administration.  Yet, as soon as the new Republican  Congress came in at the beginning of  the  21st  century,  they  eliminated  PAYGO. Two wars, two deep tax cuts  and a massive expansion of Medicare  were never paid for. As a result, we had  a $9 trillion fiscal reversal. When the  Democrats came back in, we reinstated  it; but yesterday the new Republican  Congress  exempted  $5  trillion  from  PAYGO\u2014$4 trillion of unpaid-for tax  cuts and $1.3 trillion of savings we  could have gotten from health care reform.  It  is the height of hypocrisy and  deeply disappointing.  f  THE  14TH AMENDMENT OF THE  CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED  STATES  (Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  Mr. PERLMUTTER. I first want to  extend the sympathies of Colorado and  of the Representatives to our friends  from Nebraska. We suffered the Columbine tragedy a number of years ago,  so we definitely understand how painful something like this is.  Mr. Speaker, the purpose for me rising today is to talk about what has  been given to this country in the form  of the Constitution, particularly in the  14th Amendment.  I would say to my friend from Texas,  \u2018\u2018nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property without  due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal  protection of the laws.\u2019\u2019  Until  we  passed  that  affordable  health care act, people with pre-existing conditions were being denied equal  protection of the laws. We passed that.  They now have freedom from discrimination. Yet my friends on the Republican side of the aisle want to take  away  that  freedom. That\u2019s wrong.  That\u2019s wrong for people in my district  and for millions of people across the  country because they, their kids, their  families, and their  friends have different physical conditions that require  attention and must be covered and not  discriminated against.  f  THE SUPREME COURT NEEDS A  LESSON  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, in a few  minutes, we are going to have the reading of the United States Constitution\u2014  a show for the American public\u2014for  anybody who knows anything about  constitutional law knows that it is up  to nine men and women as to what the  Constitution says.  When the Constitution was originally  drafted\u2014and I love it and I defend it\u2014  it didn\u2019t give women the right to vote,  and  it said slavery was permissible.  Until the vilified Warren Court, in its  correct decision in Brown v. Board of  Education, it said separate was equal,  and we knew it wasn\u2019t. African Americans were held back with Jim Crow  laws.  Five people on the Supreme Court,  not the whole nine, can make decisions  that change the way the Constitution  is interpreted.  Bush v. Gore, an abomination of a  case that determined the Presidency  for  8 years and  took away States\u2019  rights. The Citizens United case funded  the opposition that turned in the majority that the Republicans now have.  Making  corporations  the  equal of  people and putting money into politics  poisoned the political system. The Supreme Court should read the Constitution. They need a lesson.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore.

            "20": "H68  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE January 6, 2011  economy, and with the federal deficit as high  as  it  is,  the House and Senate must keep  looking for ways to tighten our belts. During  the  last Congress, under  the  leadership of  Speaker PELOSI, we voted to freeze the salaries of Members of Congress  in 2010 and  again  for 2011. The  resolution before  the  House  today would save an additional $35  million.  While this resolution saves $35 million, the  Republican leadership will be bringing a health  care reform repeal bill to the Floor next week  that will blow a one trillion dollar hole in the  budget. Not only would the Republican repeal  bill turn back the clock on the significant reforms and consumer protections and  jeopardize health care for millions of Americans,  their repeal bill would also add $230 billion to  the deficit over the next 10 years, and a jaw-  dropping $1 trillion of red ink over 20 years.  These are not my  figures, but  those of  the  non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.  In a word, if cutting $35 million from Congress\u2019 budget is a step in the right direction towards reducing the deficit, adding $1 trillion to  the deficit by  repealing health care  reform  takes us about 28,570 steps in the wrong direction.  I urge support for the resolution before the  House today and strong opposition to the Republican health care repeal bill next week.  Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members  to support this resolution. Let\u2019s make  it a bipartisan effort.

When you look at the data, it\u2019s clear:  deficit spending has occurred at an average, just in the last fiscal year, of  probably $110 billion a month deficit  spending.  Mr. AKIN. Oh, wait. And $110 billion  a month. That used to be the deficit in  a whole year.  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Right.  Mr. AKIN. Wow, we are setting all  kinds of records in the wrong direction.  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. You are  right. And that leads up to this discussion that we are hearing now in the  media which  I  don\u2019t  know where  they\u2019ve  been  over  the  last  several  months talking about the debt ceiling.  Well, the reason we\u2019re approaching and  about to pierce the debt ceiling is this  deficit spending that has occurred from  the previous  leadership here  in  the  House as well as the administration  who is still there.  And as we approach this debt ceiling,  we have got to push spending cuts  more and more and more. And  I\u2019m  thankful that I just was sworn in for  the second time yesterday\u2014  Mr. AKIN. We\u2019re glad to have you  back again, and we thank the good people of Georgia for making a good decision there.  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Well, thank  you. But being appointed to the Appropriations Committee, it is clear, and I  have made it clear to my constituents,  that I am not going on as a spender.  I\u2019m going on as a saver. It seems for far  too long Members would seek to be on  appropriations because they wanted to  spend money. Well, guess what. It\u2019s a  new day, a new era. And it\u2019s a just  fresh day when you have Members  going on to say, Here is how we are  going to save money. So what a great  debate we are going to have in the next  several weeks.  Mr. AKIN. That\u2019s good. Now, let\u2019s get  on to this just a little bit more. Let\u2019s  try to get into the details in terms of  procedurally. Okay, now you\u2019ve got a  new Congress. Republicans are in the  majority, and we\u2019ve got the problem.  When you take a look at the numbers  and we\u2019re spending a third more than  what we\u2019re taking in, we know we\u2019ve  got to do some cutting. But yet one of  the things that people want to pin us  down on, okay, you guys are such big  mouths about cutting spending, what  are you not going to  fund? Because  there is going to be some group that is  going to get mad at you. So how are  you going to it approach it?  And one thing that I know in State  governments  they  do  sometimes  is  E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o they say, Well, what we\u2019ve got to do is,  we\u2019re 10 percent over budget, so we  need to cut 10 percent off of everything. That makes it seem to be fair.  And that would be one way you might  approach what we\u2019ve got going on.  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Oh, you are  absolutely right. I think what we\u2019ve  heard  about  repealing ObamaCare\u2014  yesterday I introduced the legislation  again to defund it, to take away all authorizing funds going to the legislation  as well, which is another step forward.  You know, why don\u2019t we defund some  czars. That\u2019s a whole other discussion  that we\u2019ve all seen.  And then as we move back to those  2008 levels, and we might need to go  even just a little bit further and begin  cutting more and more and more, I  mean, are the decisions going to be difficult? Sure, they are. But that\u2019s why  your constituents and mine elected us  to come here and make those tough decisions.  Mr. AKIN. Congressman GRAVES, let  me lay out two ways you could approach it. If you\u2019ve got just a little bit  you\u2019ve got to cut, you could maybe  take a little bit from everything. But  there\u2019s another way you could take a  look at it when you\u2019ve got to cut one-  third. One way you could do it would  be to say, What are the essential functions that the Federal Government has  to do, and what are things that we really don\u2019t have to do because a State  could do it or the private sector could  do it?  I yield to the Chair.  SWEARINGINOFMEMBERS  FITZPATRICK and FITZPATRICK  The  SPEAKER.  If Representative  SESSIONSof Texas and Representative  of Pennsylvania would  present themselves in the well.  Messrs. SESSIONS appeared at the bar of the House, and  the Speaker administered the oath of  office to them as follows:  Do you solemnly swear or affirm that  you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against  all enemies, foreign and domestic; that  you will bear true faith and allegiance  to the same; that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and  that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which  you are about to enter, so help you  God.  Congratulations. You are now officially Members.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Ms.  BEUTLER). The  gentleman  from Missouri may resume.  Mr. AKIN. So we were just talking  about now you\u2019ve got the situation  with the Federal Government spending  a third more than it takes in. So we\u2019ve  got to  figure out some way of how  we\u2019re going to skin this cat.  And one way is to just try to take a  certain 10 percent or whatever the percentage is. Actually, it would be 33 percent off of everything or whatever. Or  what you could say would be, what are  the things that we have to do, and  HERRERA what are the things that maybe are  nice but we can\u2019t afford it, and what  are the things that may be actually unconstitutional. And  I  suspect when  you\u2019re one-third over budget, it\u2019s going  to be hard to just do a set percentage  across the board. I suspect we\u2019re going  to get into, I think, some very interesting questions about what\u2019s really  constitutional and does  the Federal  Government  really have  to do  that  function? Maybe  it\u2019s  an  important  thing to get done, but maybe the Federal Government shouldn\u2019t do it. So I  just wondered if you wanted to jump in  on that subject.  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Yes, I would  be happy to just add a little bit more  to that.  I think a few approaches you could  take when you ask the question, Is it  duplicative? Is it occurring somewhere  else? Is another agency or Department  doing  it? And  that  is after you\u2019ve  cleared the hurdle. Is it a role of the  Federal Government in general itself?  Then you could also ask, is it something you could devolve back to the  States? Have we usurped the States in  which I would think many Members of  our conference here would probably  agree. In some cases, the Federal Government has overstepped  its bounds,  and it\u2019s time to remove ourselves from  the States and allow the States to take  over.  But you know, from a business owner\u2019s perspective, what if you looked at  the Department heads or the agency  heads, and you said, You go back and  you cut 25 percent and you bring back  your recommendations; and then you  show us a budget estimate with 20 percent cuts and then one with 10 percent,  empower those agency heads to make  those decisions, to analyze their Departments and come back.  b1450  While we\u2019re also on the theme of physicians, we\u2019re  taking a  surgical approach as well as pulling out those unnecessary programs. So that would be  some approaches I would take.  Mr. AKIN. Well, those are some great  recommendations here. To  reinforce  what you\u2019ve said, I didn\u2019t have time to  get some of the charts that we normally have printed, but here\u2019s some examples.  We\u2019ve got 342 economic development  programs. Do you think we really need  342 of them? Talk about duplicative.  That seems to make your point.  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. With unemployment at what?  Mr. AKIN. 10 percent or whatever. 130  programs serving the disabled. Do we  need 130? Maybe it would be better to  consolidate, just do a couple of good  ones.  And then 130 programs serving at-  risk youth. And so these are all of  these things where you say it doesn\u2019t  even make common sense. We have to  really  start getting  into analyzing,  first of all, should we even be doing it,  and then, if we should, do we need hundreds of programs doing  something  that should be done with one or two.  l a e n b j VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:46 Aug 19, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\H06JA1.REC H06JA1         ",
            "36": "H84  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE January 6, 2011  would even attempt to successfully or  even would be unsuccessful to argue  that somehow these protections for the  individual are not worth having.  I think they will go into some obscure interpretation of the Constitution. We\u2019ll see. There\u2019s going to be a  debate on  the  floor. Unfortunately,  there will be no hearings to precede  that, and there will not be a discussion  of the details.  Mr. COHEN. And they will control  the amendments that will be permitted  to be discussed on this floor. I know  Speaker BOEHNERsaid we were going to  be able to have amendments and be  able to have good discourse.  Mr. GARAMENDI. As you know\u2014I  saw you  in Rules Committee earlier  today\u2014it  is my  impression that the  Rules Committee is going to prohibit  any amendments on the  floor. We\u2019ll  see. I mean, that has yet to be decided  by  the Rules Committee. We don\u2019t  know, but surely the one amendment I  would propose is: don\u2019t do it, maintain  the Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights, maintain  these protections that we all need.  There\u2019s not a person in this Nation  that is not subject to the possibility of  an incident that would become a reason for rescission. That\u2019s my experience. Eight years hammering the insurance  industry, you have  got  to  honor your contract. Yet because of  the laws, they were able to wiggle out  of an expensive incident.  Mr. COHEN. When I was a child, I had  polio when I was 5 years old in 1954. I  was fortunate. My father was a doctor,  and so sometimes professional courtesy, but I\u2019m sure he had insurance  that covered my hospitalization. But  there were years later, I think it was 11  years later I had a tendon-lengthening  operation  that was  immediately  related to my polio and necessary on my  Achilles tendon. That wouldn\u2019t have  been  permitted  necessarily  if  they  could use the pre-existing condition  such as polio to have denied coverage;  and whether or not how my  father  dealt with the expense and whether it\u2019s  because he was a physician, I don\u2019t  know; but I\u2019d hate to see children in  the same situation and parents in the  same situation not be permitted to get  that type of coverage later on.  Mr. GARAMENDI. I don\u2019t know  if  you were a Member of Congress at the  time, but we all under this law would  have the same policy that every American would have. We wouldn\u2019t have any  different  policy  than  the American  public would have, and the question  about rescission, and you\u2019re a prime  candidate should you lose office, which  you shouldn\u2019t, to be uninsurable if the  Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights were repealed.  Under the Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights, if  you were to leave Congress, you could  get an  insurance policy because the  pre-existing condition that you have,  polio, and an operation resulting from  the polio would go into play as a pre-  existing condition, and you would not  be able to get an insurance policy.  Mr. COHEN. Let me, if I can, read  something that I\u2019ve had prepared for  today that came from a constituent\u2019s  story, John Hopkins; and I know John  Hopkins. He\u2019s a very important and active member  in my community and  contemporary. He sent me an email,  and Mr. Hopkins requests I share this  story with the House as we consider repeal of the Affordable Care Act. I want  to share it with everybody here on C\u2013  SPAN.  John was diagnosed with two unrelated cancers during his  life. If you  know anything about cancer, getting it  twice for unrelated reasons is almost  unheard of, but it happened to John  Hopkins. Midway through his first bout  with cancer, he was, of course, dropped  from his health insurance plan. He was  left with a medical bill that wiped out  his and his wife\u2019s entire retirement  savings, as well as the value of their  house. They were never able to repay  the debt in their lifetime. When he was  diagnosed with a second bout of cancer  2 years later, he had no health insurance because there was no insurer anywhere in the market who would offer  him a policy because of the pre-existing condition.  He got some coverage in Tennessee  because of a plan called Access Tennessee for uninsurables, but it was limited to $250,000 a year. As we all know,  annual limits are set to be phased out  by 2014 because of this law, and lifetime limits are already a thing of the  past. A quarter of a million dollars  may seem like a lot of coverage; but  when somebody needs something like a  bone marrow transplant to cure their  leukemia, that single treatment would  exceed the annual cap.  My Republican colleagues have decided their first priority as the new  majority will be repealing the Affordable Care Act; and when they vote to  do this, they will be voting for the following: denying Mr. Hopkins the ability to enroll in a health insurance plan  that doesn\u2019t discriminate against him  for daring to be diagnosed with cancer  again. They will deny John Hopkins  the ability to enroll in a health plan  that will actually continue to cover his  treatment after he exhausts the current annual cap of $250,000, an amount  that many cancer patients meet in a  matter of weeks upon diagnosis,  let  alone those who are fighting two cancers over a number of years.  And it will send a message to John  Hopkins and every other single American who has ever been diagnosed or  will ever be diagnosed with a disease  like cancer that they\u2019re on their own  when it comes to coverage, that sure  they\u2019re  free  to get  treatments and  meet with their doctors, undergo laborious and  life-saving  surgeries year  after year, just so long as they can foot  the bill or try to keep it under the annual cap, because when  it comes to  cancer,  budgeting  your  treatment  should  surely  take precedence over  anything else. Right?  Mr. GARAMENDI, I am ashamed that  we are considering repeal of this affordable health care bill; and when I  see these numbers about $250,000 and I  think of the fact that the Republicans  were against any caps on taxes, they  realize $250,000 annual income in many  places is a middle-income salary, but  for  limitations on health care, they  think the  insurance company should  determine that and that\u2019s enough; and  if you have got cancer, it\u2019s not enough.  Another friend of mine Facebooked  me, Jimmy Barrasso. Jimmy worked  for a long time for a company in Memphis. He\u2019s always been successful. He  lost his job with that corporation. Because he had high cholesterol, he had  difficulties getting  insurance, and  it  took him a long time to find private insurance because of that pre-existing  condition. He  just  sent me  this on  Facebook. He was friending me and he  mentioned it, and I wanted to relate it.  There are so many people  in this  country who are getting benefits and  will get benefits and many of the benefits don\u2019t go into effect until 2014, and  the idea that this Congress, the 112th,  as its first act would do such harm to  the general welfare of the American  public is hard to fathom.  b1600  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. COHEN, thank  you so very much. Your closing sentence needs to be repeated. That the  very first piece of legislation taken up  by the new Republican majority in the  112th Congress is to repeal the Patients  Bill of Rights. It\u2019s unfathomable.  Let me now call on FRANKPALLONE,  our colleague from the great State of\u2014  yes, it is\u2014New Jersey.  Mr. PALLONE. Well, first of all, let  me thank you, my colleague from California, and each of the other speakers  here  for the contribution they have  made tonight, and particularly when I  listened to my colleague  from Tennessee  talk  about  those  particular  cases  of  individuals  that were  impacted, because that\u2019s really what this  is all about.  Again, it is amazing to me that the  first act of this new Republican majority is to try to repeal a bill, health care  reform, that really is making a difference for people on a personal level,  particularly with the patient protections.  You know, I thought to myself when  I was coming down here: Who benefits  from repeal? Who could possibly benefit from repeal? Because, as many of  you talked about, all the people who  are going to be harmed by  it, who  would benefit from it? And the only  group I could think of that would benefit from the repeal are the big insurance companies because, if you think  about it, what do they want to do?  They want  to keep  increasing premiums. I read that in your State\u2014I  don\u2019t know, you may have already  mentioned it\u2014Blue Cross/Blue Shield,  whatever, is talking about a 50-something percent increase. I cannot fathom these double-digit increases.  And, of course, as this health care reform kicks in, it\u2019s going to be more and  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:46 Aug 19, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\H06JA1.REC H06JA1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",
            "44": "H92  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE January 6, 2011  the RepubIf we repeal the Affordable Care Act,  which the CBO says will save $1.3 trillion over the next two decades, that\u2019s  money that we aren\u2019t going to have to  borrow from somebody else. They say,  oh, that\u2019s not part of the budget. We  don\u2019t have to compensate for that.  So  it\u2019s  fascinating that they basically set up these two sets of books,  and now they give the power to the  chairman of the Budget Committee,  who in this case is Mr. RYANof Wisconsin\u2014a very thoughtful, honest man.  You give him the power, however, to  make a decision that whatever the CBO  says doesn\u2019t matter. He can deem, or  decide, exactly what the impact of any  provision or any act of Congress is on  the budget. One person.  Now, I come from Kentucky. We\u2019re a  big basketball State. Last week, we  had a game, a big-game rivalry. Kentucky and Louisville played. It didn\u2019t  come out the way I would have liked it  to. But I had to think, when we set up  these rules, that would be like Louisville and Kentucky playing and saying  to Coach Pitino of Louisville or Coach  Calipari  from Kentucky, You get to  make all the calls in this game. Our  players  are  going  to  play. They\u2019re  going  to  compete hard,  but Coach  Pitino, we\u2019re taking the refs off the  field. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to  call fouls. You\u2019re going to make all the  decisions.  That\u2019s  basically what  licans have done.  What they also said and decided in  this process is that the health care reform bill\u2014changing it, repealing it\u2014  will have no impact on the deficit, no  impact  on  the  budget. That\u2019s  fascinating because, for the last year and  a half, when we debated the Affordable  Care Act, they kept talking about how  this was going to balloon the deficit,  how it was going to explode the deficit.  Trillions of dollars it was going to cost  the American taxpayer. Well, now they  say, No, it has no impact at all on the  deficit because you have to understand,  if it costs nothing to repeal it, then  there was no cost to passing it.  So one has to question who has been  honest in this debate. Who has been  honest in this debate?  I understand that finding referees as  to who is right and who is wrong and  what facts are salient and which facts  are accurate has been a difficult process. My colleague Mr. KING said that,  you know, all of a sudden, we keep  talking about this, and expect a liberal  light to go on in people\u2019s heads. Well,  we need some light on this subject because there have been billions and billions of dollars spent to create darkness about the impact of this bill, and  that process proceeds today.  So I think, as we debate this proposal  of the Republicans to do away with  many of the benefits which we are so  proud of and which millions of Americans are beginning to  feel now, we  should have the kind of discussion that  is honest, that is open, and that sheds  light on the subject. No one can do  E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o that better than my colleague from the  great State of Maryland, DONNAEDWARDS.  Ms. EDWARDS. Thank you for yielding, Mr. YARMUTH.  You know, as I listened to this discussion, I thought, I wonder what taxpayers are thinking about with this  discussion. I wonder about those taxpayers who go to work every day but  who, through no  fault of their own,  can\u2019t afford to buy health insurance  even though they work every day and  they pay taxes every day.  I thought, well, under the Affordable  Care Act, indeed, for those people, we  get to, you know, put a little bottom  under them so they can be covered, so  they can, you know, go to work and  take care of their families and can also  have the security of knowing that their  families are going to be covered with  health care.  I thought about the discussion earlier on this floor where our colleagues  on the other side of the aisle talked,  you know, somewhat disparagingly of  the young people who maybe finish college or trade school and go to get jobs,  but there is a gap in health care coverage because they\u2019ve turned 22 or 23  years old. They\u2019re working for a living,  doing what they need to do. They\u2019ve  gone to school. They\u2019ve gotten trades,  maybe, and they can\u2019t afford health  care coverage. So their parents get to  say, You know what? For all of our  peace of mind and for your security,  we\u2019re going to, you know, pay for that  health care coverage under our plan.  Mr. Speaker, as I stand here today, I  think about my son, who has just gotten a job. There was this period, and I  remember when I received that notice  from our health  insurance company.  That notice, you know, was a shocker  to me because it basically said, You\u2019re  done.  Had we not had this provision in the  Affordable Care Act that enables parents like me and other parents around  the country to have the peace of mind  of being able to keep our children, our  young people, our young working people on our health care plans, I don\u2019t  know what working families would do  out there.  Mr. Speaker, I thought also about a  conversation that I\u2019m going to share  with you, a conversation with some  seniors that I had, as I was spending  New Year\u2019s Eve with friends. One of the  seniors said to me, as we were talking  about health care, You know, I have a  medical condition. I\u2019m spending thousands of dollars, and I\u2019ve fallen into the  doughnut hole, and it is really taking a  chunk out of our pocket.  I had the privilege on December 31 of  saying to this family, Do you know  that, as of January 1, as of the next  day,  in 2011, your prescription drug  that has fallen into that doughnut hole  will actually receive a 50 percent discount?  b1710  They had no idea. I was glad to be  able to share it with them. They\u2019re not  my constituents. They live in somebody else\u2019s State, but it\u2019s great to be  able to share that with them. And  that\u2019s the experience many of our seniors all across the country are having  right now as they realize that they  won\u2019t have to bear the burden of out-  of-pocket costs for prescription drugs  that fall through a doughnut hole because they can\u2019t afford  it anymore.  Their young people will be able to be  covered until they\u2019re 26. If you experience domestic violence in a handful of  States, that\u2019s a preexisting condition.  Guess what? Insurance companies will  no longer, as we move into the implementation of our health care reform  bill, be able to call that a preexisting  condition.  And so I will close and allow you  some additional opportunity  in your  time, but I do want to say that it was  really compelling to read the Constitution here on the floor of the House of  Representatives  today, and again, a  very important reminder of our obligation as elected officials to look out for  the general welfare of the people, and I  can think of no better way to do that  than making sure that we protect the  health insurance, the health care that  Americans have been guaranteed because of what we were able to accomplish with the Affordable Care Act.  Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the distinguished Congresswoman  from Maryland for her comments, and I\u2019m actually kind of glad that Congressman  KINGbrought up these major benefits  which are now helping families across  this country.  Ms. EDWARDS talked about the benefit of adding your son or daughter  under 26 to your policy, and Mr. KING  basically  pooh-poohed  that\u2014I  don\u2019t  know if that\u2019s exactly a good legislative term, but kind of ridiculed that.  And then he talked about lifetime limits and how lifetime limits were not  necessarily something that we should  worry about in spite of the fact that almost a million Americans a year, historically, over the last few years, have  gone bankrupt because they either had  no insurance or their insurance was inadequate and they lost everything they  had because of health care costs, because of a cancer diagnosis or serious  accident. These are real-life stories.  These are not abstractions.  And I understand that we have many  colleagues on the other side of the aisle  who believe, with almost a religious  zeal, in certain things like the perfection of the marketplace, in spite of the  fact that we\u2019ve seen time after time  after time in this country, not too long  ago with the financial system, how our  markets often fail, how we have created or allowed to be created enormous  sources of power and concentrations of  economic power in this country that  have basically distorted the marketplaces, and that is very, very true in  the area of health insurance.  We have many, many States in which  one company, one company, one  insurer will dominate the insurance market, 85, 90 percent of the insurance in  l a e n b j VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:46 Aug 19, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\H06JA1.REC H06JA1         ",

Well, I\u2019d say to  my friend from North Carolina that he  was talking about the fact that seniors  will see this doughnut hole, their prescription drug prices go back up, the  costs go back up; but even, I think,  more worrisome than that is the fact  that, under the Affordable Care Act,  those same seniors receive $250.  In my district in Colorado, the suburbs of Denver, 31,000 seniors received  this past fall $250 in assistance to payments of their prescription drugs. Even  with that, we still save the $230 billion  that you were talking about. Yet, when  the Republicans repeal this in kind of  an \u2018\u2018all or nothing\u2019\u2019 situation, do those  seniors have to pay that $250 back,  each of them? I don\u2019t know. I think  they ought to be worried about that,  and that\u2019s why this is such an extreme  measure.  They are taking away freedoms that  belong to the people, that belong to  Americans. They are doing it in a radical and ideological way. When they  said during the campaign, you know,  Let\u2019s put people back to work, and let\u2019s  not spend too much money, they\u2019re  spending more. They\u2019re taking away  freedoms, and  I am concerned  that  those seniors are going to have to pay  that $250 back, per senior. The seniors  should be concerned as well.  This is a radical act, Mr. Speaker and  Mr. PRICE. We have got to fight it. I  hate fighting these battles right out of  the box, but if they\u2019re going to take  these kinds of radical positions, we  have no choice.  With that, I would yield to my friend  from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER).  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you. I appreciate the gentleman\u2019s courtesy for  permitting me to speak just as I appreciate my  colleagues  coming  to  the  floor to spotlight something that each  and every American needs to be deeply  concerned about.  I listened, for example, for the last 4  years, as a member of the Budget Committee, to my dear friend and colleague  Mr. RYANtalk about the skyrocketing  problem  of  escalating  entitlement  under  Medicare.  Absolutely  right.  There are 79 million of the geezer baby  boomers like me who are going to start  collecting Medicare\u201410,000 a day starting this week and continuing  for 19  years\u2014and because of the development  of more improvements in health care,  not only are there more of us, but we  are going to want more complex and  expensive care.  My Republican friends were talking  about an entitlement crisis. The irony  was\u2014and we all heard it on the campaign trail\u2014they talked about slashing  Medicare, which they want to repeal  starting next week. A great deal of  irony.  As  the  independent  scorekeeper\u2014the Congressional Budget Office\u2014has pointed out and as you have  repeated on the House floor, the legislation will, in fact, save several hundred billion dollars. More  important  than that, it puts in place reforms that  will further reduce entitlement spending.  I know my good friend from Vermont  is well familiar with the Dartmouth  Atlas in dealing with health care disparities around the country. I come  from a part of the country where one of  the problems we have is that Medicare  needs to be reformed, which is what we  started in this legislation. They\u2019re relatively modest steps, but they\u2019re going  to save a couple hundred billion dollars. We need to do more. Rather than  repealing these reforms, like stopping  unnecessary hospital  re-admissions\u2014  just that item costs over $12 billion a  year\u2014these reforms could enable us to  bend the cost curve. If everybody practiced medicine the way it\u2019s practiced in  metropolitan Portland, Oregon, which  is half the price of McAllen, Texas, or  Miami, Florida, there wouldn\u2019t be an  entitlement crisis for decades to come.  I appreciate my colleagues focusing  on the hypocrisy and on the recklessness of trying to repeal health care reform that makes a difference  for 32  million uninsured Americans and that  provides more benefit for the seniors  with their prescription drugs. Most important and under-appreciated is that  it would reform Medicare so that, instead of driving us off a cliff over the  next 20 years, it would, in fact, help us  change how medicine is practiced to  provide incentives for value, medical  value, rather than just volume.  Mr. WELCH. Thank you, the gentleman from Oregon.  Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time I have?  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 3 minutes remaining.  Mr. WELCH. All right. Let me just  ask the gentleman from North Carolina, Would you like to make any closing remarks and then yield to the gentleman from Colorado?  Mr. PRICE  of North Carolina.  thank the gentleman.  I would like to just underscore what  our colleague  from Oregon has  just  said.  There  is  so much  concern,  obviously\u2014and for good reason\u2014about the  future of Medicare. The most conservative estimate  I have  seen  is  that  I  health care reform extends the fiscal  solvency of Medicare by 8 years, and  some estimates are much more than  that. So to simply throw that overboard as well as to talk about this  doughnut hole\u2014these thousands of dollars that senior citizens are paying full  freight on for medicines they simply  must have\u2014and this gap in coverage is  ridiculous, and we are finally fixing it.  What  insurance policy do any of us  know about that would have that kind  of gap in coverage?  As the gentleman from Colorado said,  $250 payments  this year.  I mean,  I  guess this raises the question as to  whether  even  that might be  taken  back; but in future years, we are going  to close that doughnut hole, and we are  going to extend the solvency of Medicare. Anybody  concerned about  the  health care for this country\u2019s senior  citizens simply has to be very, very  alarmed about what is going on in this  House right now.  Mr. WELCH. Thank you, the gentleman from North Carolina.  I yield for the final word from the  gentleman from Colorado.  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Sure. I appreciate my friends.  You know, instead of amending or repairing, as Mr. PRICE from North Carolina described it, they want to repeal,  just take it away.  Well, they\u2019re taking away freedoms.  They\u2019re taking away the freedom from  discrimination for prior illnesses, like  my daughter with epilepsy,  like the  daughter who had Crohn\u2019s disease, or  the friend at the gas station. It\u2019s taking away the freedom from cancellation because you get sick, you know,  and lose your insurance. You know, it\u2019s  taking away the freedom to move jobs  so you\u2019re not stuck in a job, so you can  move jobs and not fear losing your insurance. I mean, they\u2019re taking away a  lot\u2014and maybe this $250 that went to  the seniors. It is a radical move to take  these freedoms away, and I hope they  think twice and don\u2019t vote to repeal.  With that, I would yield back to my  friend from Vermont for his final remarks.  Mr. WELCH. Well, I thank my colleagues for being here.  The bottom line is, anytime we pass  a major piece of legislation, we should  have the humility to acknowledge it  can be improved\u2014and we all do. We can  make it better. We can make it stronger. But this totally destroys things  that we have been fighting for decades  to achieve on behalf of the American  people: help for seniors with their prescription drugs, extending the financial  viability of Medicare, changing and encouraging a new way of delivering  health care services, moving away from  fee-for-service, volume-driven  to patient-centered,  performance-based  care, and then insurance reforms that  put the patients in charge, which acknowledge that we are all  in  it together. This takes away the absolute  unilateral power of for-profit insurance  companies  to  decide whether  your  daughter or mine has health care.

            "60": "E18  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014Extensions of Remarks January 6, 2011  For nearly  three decades, Mr. Kurowyckyj  helped manage his  family-owned business,  Kurowyckyj Meats,  Inc.,  in Manhattan\u2019s East  Village neighborhood, a commercial and cultural hub  for New Yorkers of Ukrainian and  Polish descent during  the post-World War  II  era. Founded in 1955 by Mr. Kurowyckyj\u2019s father, the shop became an integral part of the  neighborhood, and a mecca  for gourmands  throughout  the  tri-state  area.  Kurowyckyj  Meats was acclaimed  throughout New York  not only for its delicious, fresh pork products  such as bologna,  frankfurters,  rolled bacon,  sweet  sausages,  spicy  salami,  trays  of  smoked hams, and homemade kovbasa, but  also for its personal customer service. It was  praised by the New York Times as an \u2018\u2018East  Village haven\u2019\u2019 and written up glowingly in respected periodicals  such as Gourmet and  Food and Wine magazines. The shop was one  of the last in the city to operate an original  smokehouse, which lent a unique flavor to the  store\u2019s delicacies. Sadly, the store closed in  2007, a victim of changing times and tastes.  Remembered for his continuous generosity,  Mr. Kurowyckyj made immeasurable contributions  to  the civic  life of his community. For  much of his life, Mr. Kurowyckyj was a dedicated and energetic member of New York\u2019s  Community Board 3, applying his strong leadership abilities and lifelong devotion to Lower  Manhattan  to maintaining and  improving  the  quality of life in the neighborhood he loved.  Among  his many  volunteer  efforts, Mr.  Kurowyckyj dedicated his time and attention to  several local institutions in the community, including the St. George Ukrainian Church. His  enterprising  initiative and dogged perseverance were instrumental in enabling the church  to move into its current location on East 7th  Street, and its site remains a testament to his  efforts.  As a distinguished leader of his community,  Mr. Kurowyckyj not only reached out to local  residents, but  to  recent  immigrants as well.  Upon  their arrival  in  the neighborhood, Mr.  Kurowyckyj provided assistance and knowledge  to help  them establish  themselves  in  New York. His compassion and individual attention exerted a strong positive impact on the  lives of countless individuals.  Mr. Kurowyckyj\u2019s  proud  devotion  to  his  Ukrainian heritage is carried on today by his  wife, Iryna Kurowyckyj, President of the National Board of the Ukrainian National Women\u2019s League of America. Mr. Kurowyckyj  is  also  survived by his  son,  Jerry,  Jr., and  daughter, Oksana.  Mr. Speaker, I salute the life and work of  Mr. Jerry Kurowyckyj and I ask that my distinguished colleagues in this House join me in  recognizing his extraordinary service to others  and  immeasurable contributions  to  the civic  and business life of our nation\u2019s greatest city.  f  REMEMBERING COREY ANKUM  HON. MIKE QUIGLEY  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 6, 2011  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  remember a Chicago hero. On Dec. 23, firefighter Corey Ankum tragically lost his life in  the  line of duty when  the  roof of a South  Shore building collapsed. Corey was just 34  years old.  A former member of the Chicago Police Department, Corey had been a firefighter for just  18 months. He left the Police force to follow in  the  footsteps of his close  relative, Gerald  Glover,  a  veteran  firefighter. Gerald, who  rushed to the scene of the burning building in  South Shore, remembered Corey as someone  who \u2018\u2018loved helping people.\u2019\u2019  Whether it was battling the flames of a burning building or helping to keep neighborhoods  safe, Corey spent his life serving Chicago and  protecting Chicagoans. His selflessness will  live on through his memory, and the lives of  his surviving wife and children.  I join the rest of Chicago in mourning the  loss of one of our own. The city Corey gave  his life to protect will never forget him.  May he rest in peace.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF DR.  BHUPENDRA PATEL  HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 6, 2011  Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge  the achievements of Bhupendra  Patel, M.D., a remarkable man who has dedicated himself in service to others. The Chief of  the Department of Medicine at the Mount Sinai  Hospital in Queens, Dr. Patel is also an important and inspirational voice for the thriving Indian-American  community  of  our  nation\u2019s  greatest city. A selfless advocate for his patients as well as a dedicated and generous  philanthropist, \u2018\u2018Bhupi\u2019\u2019 Patel is truly an example and role model for the community, and I  am proud to call him my friend.  Dr. Bhupendra Patel has demonstrated a  lifelong passion for the study and practice of  medicine. Born  and  raised  in Kenya,  he  earned an MBBS  from Baroda Medical College in India. The political unrest there, coupled with immigration of many of his friends to  the United States, inspired Dr. Patel to conduct his medical internship and residency at  the Long  Island Jewish Hospital, where he  worked as an internist. Dr. Patel continued to  make  important contributions  to  the  field of  medical education by serving as an Assistant  Clinical Professor of Medicine at the renowned  Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.  Throughout his career, Dr. Patel has striven  successfully  to help serve  the needs of  the  growing Asian-American community  in New  York City, serving as  the President of  the  Gujarati Samaj of Greater New York and helping found the Nargis Dutt Memorial Foundation. As President of  the Gujarati Samaj,  Bhupendra Patel helped  raise money  for a  new  community  center  to  serve  the  local  Gujarati community. The Nargis Dutt Foundation that he helped found has committed itself  to improving medical care for cancer patients  throughout  India  for  the past decade, supplying critically needed medical equipment to  healthcare  facilities  there. Dr.  Patel  also  serves  on  the  board  of  \u2018\u2018SHAREing  and  CAREing,\u2019\u2019 an organization in Queens that for  the last sixteen years has provided essential  services to those afflicted with breast cancer,  helping to ensure the quality of their medical  and social services and providing  them with  critical tools to help them in their moment of  need.  Dr. Patel\u2019s activism extends beyond  the  world of medicine. As President of the Indian-  American Center  for Political Awareness, he  has worked not only to improve bilateral relations between  India and America, but  to  increase political awareness of and boost  the  participation of  the  Indian American community. In so doing, he has helped pave the way  for second generation Americans of Indian descent, urging  them  to  remain  involved and  build on earlier progress. Dr. Patel\u2019s considerable  contributions  to medicine and philanthropy have been widely acknowledged; he  has been honored by the Gujarati Samaj of  Greater New York, the Indian Dental Association of the United States, and 100 Black Men,  and was presented  the  \u2018\u2018Outstanding Asian  American\u2019\u2019 award by  former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, as well as the prestigious  2008 Ellis Island Medal of Honor.  Mr. Speaker, in recognition of a lifetime of  service to others, I request that my colleagues  join me  in paying  tribute  to Dr. Bhupendra  \u2018\u2018Bhupi\u2019\u2019 Patel, a great New Yorker and a great  American who made  immeasurable  improvements to the quality of life of his fellow New  Yorkers. Dr. Patel\u2019s  selfless and enduring  dedication to serving others and to the civic  life of our nation serves as an inspiration to us  all.  f  HONORING STATE SENATOR DAVE  ARONBERG  HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 6, 2011  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor of a dedicated public servant,  fierce  consumer advocate, and my dear friend, State  Senator Dave Aronberg.  A native of Miami, Dave attended Harvard  College and Harvard Law School. Shortly after  graduation, Dave began his work with the office of the State Insurance Commissioner taking on  foreign  insurance companies  that refused  to honor World War  II era policies  issued to victims of the Holocaust.  Dave\u2019s passion for public service next took  him  to  the office of  the Attorney General,  where he became an Assistant Attorney General. It was in this capacity that Dave was responsible for prosecuting consumer fraud and  led the lawsuits against \u2018\u2018Miss Cleo\u2019s\u2019\u2019 fraudulent business holdings.  In 2000, Dave was chosen to participate in  the prestigious White House Fellows program  as a Special Assistant to the Secretary of the  Treasury  for  international money  laundering.  During his  fellowship, Dave represented  the  Treasury Department at a global summit on  money laundering and the laundering of terrorist assets in Malaysia. He then traveled as  part of an official White House delegation to  meet with foreign officials and to visit refugee  camps in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.  After his fellowship, Dave returned to South  Florida and in 2002 was elected to represent  the 27th District of Florida in the State Senate.  During his 8 years in the Senate, Dave continued his advocacy for strong consumer protections, was a member of Florida\u2019s Medicaid  task force, and led the fight that successfully  secured  federal  funding  for  the Everglades  Restoration Project.

And if you go to the hospital for low blood sugar, or see a specialist,  it costs several hundred dollars.\u2019 He was previously under his parent\u2019s coverage but now  his own insurance, which \u2018bad as it is,\u2019 he  added, has been further downgraded because  of the economy. \u2018But,\u2019 he said, \u2018I don\u2019t have  much choice unless I get another job, and  that\u2019s not at all easy these days.\u2019\u2019\u2019 Chris\u2014  Frederick, 7/23/2009  \u2018\u2018Frank\u2019s story centers around his fiance\u00b4e.  She\u2019s a breast cancer survivor. The chemotherapy, according to Frank, \u2018cured the cancer but devastated her body. She continues  to have health problems,\u2019 he told me. These  include diabetes and psoriatic arthritis for  which she is treated with methotrexate and  Enbril injections. She had been getting her  medications through PAC  (Physicians Assistance Care of Maryland) but, as Frank explained to me, \u2018Only the diabetes medicines  qualified and those she got through this program were less effective than what she was  previously taking.\u2019 Now that she is working,  she is no longer eligible for the program  (which requires an income of less than $1,400  a month). Her new job offers health insurance but, \u2018the premiums are so high that if  she gets the policy, there\u2019d be no money for  anything else.\u2019 Getting health  insurance,  would \u2018make it impossible for her to live,\u2019  Frank told me. \u2018And, even with the policy,  the medications would be too expensive. Basically,\u2019 Frank summarized for me, \u2018without  healthcare, she has pain and suffering, can\u2019t  get out of bed and so could lose the job.\u2019  That\u2019s terrible, I said. \u2018Oh, it could be worse  I guess,\u2019 he  replied,  shaking his head.\u2019\u2019  Frank\u2014Frederick, 7/23/2009  \u2018\u2018I met Howard and Tauyna over breakfast  at  the Days  Inn. Howard  told me  that  they\u2019ve generally been OK, but even with insurance,  \u2018deductibles have been  increasing  and out-of-pocket expenses also going up.\u2019  But Howard wished to share a story from  twenty years ago.  \u2018It actually relates to  what\u2019s happening today,\u2019 he told me. He was  between jobs, he explained, having left a position with health insurance for a higher-  paying  job  that did not, however, offer  health benefits. Soon after, his wife had a  tubal pregnancy and with the hospital bills  he ended up having to taking out a loan for  $8,000  (\u2018a huge chunk of change  in those  days,\u2019 he added). The doctor forgave his fee  and he was able to negotiate a half-price  with the anesthesiologist. \u2018I sure don\u2019t know  what would happen if it were today.\u2019\u2019\u2019 Howard\u2014Frederick, 7/24/2009  \u2018\u2018Brenda\u2019s story is about her father who  died two months ago. She told her story with  a mix of disbelief and quiet anger though she  was heartened to be able to share with others  what she felt was a true health insurance  horror story. Her late father had diabetes  since 1995. His illness was complicated by  neuropathy and multiple foot infections resulting in an amputation of one great toe.  Earlier this year, his  insurance company,  Group Health, told him that they were dropping him  for medical noncompliance although Brenda, who\u2019s a nurse, said this was  patently a lie and they had medical proof, including doctor\u2019s attestations, that he was in  compliance. And then he had a stroke, which  was compounded with multiple complications. He came down with sepsis, had to have  another amputation, this time below-the-  knee. Though the MD said everything was  OK, the operation was, in fact, a \u2018was a disaster,\u2019 Brenda told me. It turned out he was  left unattended in the hallway, coded in recovery, had a head bleed, was given CPR, put  on a ventilator and admitted to the ICU. He  never regained consciousness. He was taken  to a Palliative Care unit and though he was  put on a morphine drip, he survived for two  more tortuous months. All during this time,  people  from the hospital kept coming by  telling his already grieving wife that she  would be responsible for the bill. \u2018The total  bill is $69,000 and still going up,\u2019 she said.\u2019\u2019  Brenda\u2014Gaithersburg, 7/24/2009  \u2018\u2018Shayla\u2019s been newly enrolled in a PPO.  Supposedly better than an HMO, she had  high expectations. \u2018But,\u2019 she told me, \u2018I don\u2019t  understand why it\u2019s so good. First, you pay  more,\u2019 she explained, \u2018and second, you still  get a bill AFTER the co-pay.\u2019 And then she  told me about the prescription plan, which  requires you to mail away for the medications and it often takes 4 to 6 weeks for delivery. She  shook her head.  \u2018That  just  doesn\u2019t make sense!\u2019\u2019\u2019 Shayla\u2014Gaithersburg,  7/25/2009  \u2018\u2018Keith is one of the founders of the ubiquitous Food Not Bombs organization. His organization has protested around the world  and now he\u2019s in front of the White House delivering his message to all those gathered.  His story is simple: he\u2019s got fibromyalgia,  which he says he acquired after being tortured by the CIA during one of his several incarcerations  for  illegally  delivering  free  food. With his income and this sort of pre-existing condition, he can never get health insurance.\u2019\u2019 Keith\u2014Washington, 7/26/2009  \u2018\u2018Doris, from New York, is here in DC visiting.  \u2018No  insurance, can\u2019t afford  it.\u2019 She  said, \u2018and doesn\u2019t ever go to a doctor.

JIM COSTA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 6, 2011  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  recognize Community Regional Medical Center on the occasion of the grand opening of  Terry\u2019s House, a new, state-of-the-art facility in  downtown Fresno, California, which will provide much needed support and housing  to  allow families to stay close to sick and injured  loved ones  in  the hospital. Located  in  the  heart of the Fresno medical district, this new  15,874  square-foot,  two-story  family house  with twenty guest suites will be the first hospitality house in the Greater Fresno Area.  This residential facility is named in honor of  Terry Richards who suffered and survived a  serious trauma at the age of five when he was  injured  in a  car accident. For nearly  five  months, his mother was forced to travel nearly  80 miles a day to see her son while he was  recovering  in  the hospital. Currently,  family  members of patients must seek accommodations miles from the hospital, and many who  cannot afford lodging sleep in waiting rooms,  in their cars or try their best to find a spot in  a busy hospital. Often, patients\u2019  loved ones  have no alternative but to leave the hospital  and make the long drive home. Now families  have Terry\u2019s House,  their home away  from  home, while their loved ones receive care.  Terry\u2019s House was made possible by  the  tireless work of Terry Richards\u2019 brother, Tom  Richards, a  local community developer and  CEO of the Penstar Group. With the dedication of Tom Richards, Leta Ciavaglia, the Terry\u2019s House Development Council, the Community Regional Medical Center Foundation and  many generous members of the community, a  family dream has become a reality.  Mr. Speaker, I applaud Terry\u2019s House and  its many supporters for their efforts to create  a facility which keeps families together during  times of need. I ask my colleagues to join me  in commending Tom Richards and the community members of Fresno who have worked  unremittingly to make the opening of Terry\u2019s  House possible.  f  THE  WALK  FOR  HEALTHCARE:  HEALTHCARE STORIES FROM ILLINOIS  AND  INDIANA  COLLECTED BY OGAN GUREL, M.D.  HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 6, 2011  Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker,  I submit  the  following stories, collected by Dr. Ogan Gurel.  \u2018\u2018Martha finds it shameful that America  can\u2019t provide basic health care for its citizens, like any other developed country does.  \u2018Civilized nations care for those in need,\u2019 she  said. She especially noted that the connection of health care insurance to employment  status was a big problem. \u2018It doesn\u2019t make  sense. If you get sick, you have a greater  chance of being unemployed.\u2019\u2019\u2019 Martha\u2014Chicago, 6/27/2009  \u2018\u2018Addison, on the right, is Martha\u2019s older  son. He\u2019s a student in college who, with evident pride, told me that in the past election  he had just voted for the first time. As he  embarks on study abroad in Italy this coming fall, he is, despite his glowing patriotism,  embarrassed that health care for all, as he  has learned is the case in Italy, doesn\u2019t exist  here in America.\u2019\u2019 Addison\u2014Chicago, 6/27/2009  \u2018\u2018I met Ron along Martin Luther King  Drive. He was working at painting a fence.  He waved his hand towards the south side  streets beyond and said, \u2018Yes, there\u2019s many  people here without health insurance.\u2019 With  a serious look, he turned back towards me.  \u2018Yes, without health care.\u2019 He shared a story  of an old lady from the neighborhood. She  had a change in coverage that now made it  too expensive to get her insulin for her diabetes. \u2018It was all very fishy business,\u2019 Ron  told me. This lady, on Medicare, was in the  hospital for some time. An insurance salesman came to her hospital bed and convinced  her to change her coverage (Ron couldn\u2019t recall the exact name but he told me it sounded, \u2018Something like Well Care\u2019). What happened was that this \u2018new\u2019 plan didn\u2019t cover  the old lady\u2019s particular type of insulin so,  with her  \u2018brand-new\u2019 private supplemental  insurance plan in place, she ended up now  spending $129 a month, out-of-pocket, for her  medication. The insurance salesman is gone  and now she\u2019s struggling, Ron tells me, on  top of her fight to stay well, to piece together her wrecked insurance and financial  situation.\u2019\u2019 Ron\u2014Chicago, 6/27/2009  \u2018\u2018Stopping by the Chicago Baptist Institute, I met Rev.

            "76": "E34  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014Extensions of Remarks January 6, 2011  SUPPORT OF A RESOLUTION TO  PERMIT DELEGATES AND THE  RESIDENT  COMMISSIONER  TO  THE CONGRESS TO CAST VOTES  IN  THE  COMMITTEE  OF  THE  WHOLE HOUSE ON THE STATE  OF THE UNION  HON. MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO  OFGUAM  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 6, 2011  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution introduced by my good  friend and colleague, Minority Whip STENY  HOYERof Maryland that would restore the voting  rights  for  the Delegates and Resident  Commissioner during Committee of the Whole  proceedings during the 112th Congress.  As  I stated yesterday,  the  rules  for  the  112th Congress  leave  this body  less  transparent and less responsive to our constituents.  Eliminating  the  right  for Delegates and  the  Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole deprives our constituents  with  the understanding of how we stand on  important issues. The fact that our vote in the  Committee of the Whole is symbolic is further  evidence of why such a right does not diminish the role of other Members of the House of  Representatives; in fact, allowing us the right  to a symbolic vote enhances  long-cherished  values of this body.  Moreover, affording us the right to vote in  the Committee of the Whole ensures that equities of our constituents are covered in legislation that is pending or being debated by this  body. In June 2009 the House of Representatives debated and voted on H.R. 2346,  the  Supplemental Appropriations Act  for Fiscal  Year 2009. The bill contained language that  allowed the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay to any of the territories and it did  not provide the Governor of each respective  territory with  the right  to be notified of any  such transfer. Our right to vote in the Committee of  the Whole afforded us  the opportunity  to  raise  this matter before  the entire  body and  subsequent  legislation  that  contained such transfer prohibition language did  expressly include the territories. Our right to  vote in the Committee of the Whole afforded  us all the ability to represent the interests of  our respective territories. Our voice was heard  and changes were made.  Many men and women  in uniform come  from the territories and the District of Columbia. Many have sacrificed for our country, and,  in  fact,  the per capita  rate of deaths  for  servicemembers from the territories is higher  than most states. Yet despite  the patriotism  and service that men and women from the territories show, the new leadership of the House  of Representatives saw it fit to take away one  of our most basic rights\u2014the right to vote and  effectively represent the needs of our constituents.  I also enter into the RECORD letters the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner sent  to the leaders requesting an opportunity to address this rules change prior to the convening  of the 112th Congress. Regrettably, the opportunity  to address  this matter prior  to yesterday\u2019s convening was not presented. Therefore, and based on the action taken yesterday,  I stand in support of the resolution introduced  today by Mr. HOYERand hope that it will be  brought to the floor for a vote in the near future.  CONGRESSOFTHEUNITEDSTATES,  DEAR SPEAKER-DESIGNATE Washington, DC, December 22, 2010.  Hon. JOHNA. BOEHNER,  Speaker-designate, House  of Representatives,  The Capitol, Washington, DC.  BOEHNER: Now  that a summary of proposed Rules for the  112th Congress  is circulating and we  find  that the rule enabling the Delegates and  Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole is slated for elimination,  we write to express our concern and renew  our request for a meeting with you to discuss  this matter prior to January 5, 2011.  You will no doubt recall that we wrote last  month to urge retention of this rule. We reiterate  that  this  symbolic exercise of our  country\u2019s democratic principles has great  meaning to our more than four million constituents, who fight and die alongside their  fellow Americans residing in the 50 States to  secure the right to vote for people residing in  such distant lands as Iraq and Afghanistan.  While this issue has been viewed through a  partisan lens in the past, largely because  none of us is a member of the Republican  Conference, we respectfully submit that this  fact should not be used to preclude us front  exercising this most fundamental function of  representative  democracies,  especially  through a procedure which by its design can  never be determinative of any vote.  Therefore, we ask that you retain this existing rule in the Rules package your Conference is preparing for adoption on opening  day of the 112th Congress. Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. We  look forward to continuing to work with you  on behalf of our constituents, your fellow  Americans residing in the U.S. territories.  Sincerely,  PEDROR. PIERLUISI.  MADELEINEZ. BORDALLO.  ENIF.H. FALEOMAVAEGA.  DONNAM. CHRISTENSEN.  GREGORIOKILILICAMACHO  SABLAN.  CONGRESSOFTHEUNITEDSTATES,  Washington, DC, November 19, 2010.  Hon. JOHNA. BOEHNER,  Speaker-designate, House  of Representatives,  The Capitol, Washington, DC.  DEARSPEAKER-DESIGNATEBOEHNER: As the  Republican Conference prepares its package  of proposed House Rules for consideration on  the opening day of the 112th Congress, we respectfully urge you to retain the rule that  enables the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote when the House resolves  into the Committee of the Whole, and that  provides for an automatic revote in the full  House when the votes of the Delegates or the  Resident Commissioner are decisive.  This rule has been found to pass constitutional muster by the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the District of Columbia. See Michel v.  Anderson, 14 F.3d 623 (D.C. Cir. 1994). It has  not impeded the work of the House during  the three Congresses in which it has been in  place:  the  103rd Congress  (1993\u20131994),  the  110th Congress (2007\u20132008), and the current  111th Congress (2010\u20132011), The rule has been  carefully crafted to allow the Majority to decide when it is appropriate for legislation to  be considered in the Committee of the Whole  and, more specifically, to be subject to delegate voting. Therefore, if the Majority determines that a particular bill is better considered without delegate voting, the Rules Committee can report a rule that provides for  voting to be structured accordingly\u2014as occurred in several instances during the 110th  and 111th Congresses. We deeply appreciate  that your Conference did not seek to repeal  or otherwise alter this rule when the Ranking Republican Member of the Rules Committee offered his Motion to Commit with  instructions at the start of the 111th Congress. We hope that your proposed Rules  package for the 112th Congress will be consistent with that prior position.  There are compelling reasons to retain the  rule. First, we know that your Conference,  like our Caucus, values and seeks to promote  open and transparent government. Our constituents can more effectively hold us accountable if there is a record of how we vote  on legislation considered by the House. Although we recognize that the vote conferred  upon us by this rule is essentially symbolic,  it has genuine meaning for those we represent. The rule obligates us to take public  positions on issues of national importance  that will affect the lives of our constituents.  This  enables  our  constituents  to  better  evaluate the quality of our representation.  In addition, we believe this is an issue of  fundamental  fairness with profound moral  implications. Our constituents are part of  the American family. They pledge allegiance  to the same flag and serve alongside their  fellow countrymen  in our nation\u2019s armed  forces. To deprive their duly elected representatives of this small privilege, which  does no harm to this institution, would send  a message of exclusion to Americans living  in the territories and in the District of Columbia. We implore you not to send that  message.  Sincerely,  PEDROR. PIERLUISI.  MADELEINEZ. BORDALLO.  ENIF.H. FALEOMAVAEGA.  DONNAM. CHRISTENSEN.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  remember the courage and honor the life of  firefighter Edward Stringer. Edward was killed  in the line of duty on Dec. 23, when the roof  of a burning South Shore building collapsed.  He was 47 years old.  Edward often joked that he was the guy running  into burning buildings when everyone  else was running out. That was the case on  the afternoon of the tragedy that took his life.  Worried  there might be a homeless man or  woman seeking shelter  from  the cold  in  the  abandoned building, his commitment  to  the  Chicagoans  he  swore  to  protect was  far  stronger than any sense of self-preservation.  A 12-year veteran of the Chicago Fire Department, Edward worked out of the firehouse  at 63rd and Dorchester. He was a  lifetime  South Sider, a proud Chicagoan and an American hero. His bravery will never be forgotten  by the city he gave his life to protect.  May Mr. Stringer rest in peace.

            "6": "H210  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE January 18, 2011  We are here because we heard the  American people in the last election.  We are here because we believe  it\u2019s  really important to do in office what  you said you would do. We said we  would have a straight up-or-down vote  to repeal this health care  law, and  that\u2019s precisely what we are doing here  today.  Now, Mr. Speaker, why do we believe  this? Because this health care law, if  left in place, will accelerate our country\u2019s path  toward bankruptcy. This  health care law, if left in place, will do  as the President\u2019s own chief actuary  says it will do: It will increase health  care costs. We are already seeing premiums go up across the board. We are  already hearing from thousands of employers across the country who are  talking about dropping their employer-  sponsored health insurance, and we are  already hearing  about  the  lack  of  choices that consumers will get as this  new law is put into place. This new law  is a fiscal house of cards, and it is a  health care house of cards. It does not  make our health care system better. I  would argue it makes it weaker.  There are two ways to attack this  problem, and I want to say in the outset to my friends on the other side of  the aisle we agree that health care  needs fixing. We agree that there are so  many serious, legitimate problems in  the health care system that need fixing. Affordable  insurance,  the uninsured, people with high health care  costs and high health care risks, those  need to be addressed. But we can fix  what\u2019s not working  in health  care  without breaking what\u2019s working  in  health care.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I would simply say this: We believe we can get to  the moment  of  having  affordable  health care for every American, regardless of preexisting conditions, without  having the government take it over,  without $1 trillion of a combination of  Medicare  benefit  cuts  and  tax  increases. We believe in this: Let\u2019s have  health care reform put the patient in  charge, not the government in charge.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield myself an additional 20 seconds to simply  say we believe that health care ought  to be individually based, and it ought  to be patient centered.  There are two ways to go: Put the  government  in charge and have the  government  put  in  place  rationing  mechanisms to tighten the screws and  ration health care; or put the consumer  in charge and have providers compete  for our business as patients, hospitals,  doctors, and insurers. That\u2019s the system we want.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself 4 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I hope the tenor and  substance of the debate we have in this  House over the next few days will be  worthy of the American people and reflect well on this Congress.  Many of us believe we should focus  our efforts here today on measures to  help put people back to work, rather  than on a bill that takes away important patient and consumer protections.  And we don\u2019t think it makes a whole  lot of  sense  to debate a bill  that,  thankfully, will go nowhere in the Senate and would certainly be vetoed by  the President. However, the Republican  majority  is entitled to use  its time  here as it chooses. And while we believe we should be doing that focused  on jobs, perhaps this debate will clear  up many of the myths and misinformation about the health care law that was  signed by President Obama.  I\u2019m interested to hear my colleagues  say that they can identify with all the  problems  in the health care system.  Between the year 2000 and year 2006,  premiums  in  this  country  doubled,  health  insurance  company  profits  quadrupled, and this Congress did nothing. Why not put your plan on the table  first so everybody can see it before you  begin taking away the important patient protections in this bill taking effect just since last March? And within  that 9-month period, that law has made  an important and positive difference to  millions of Americans.  In fact, we wish our Republican colleagues would take a few days, maybe  even just a few hours, to have congressional hearings to listen to those individuals and families. The new Republican majority said it wanted to listen  to the American people, but it has not  invited a single American outside this  Congress to a hearing to testify on the  repeal bill we are debating today.  As a result, we on the other side of  the aisle have had to schedule an unofficial hearing. It\u2019s going on right now,  not 100 yards from where we debate, in  the Capitol Visitor Center. And I encourage all of you to drop by, because  if you do, you\u2019re going to hear some  stories. You\u2019re going to hear the stories from moms and dads of young people who will tell you how they are relieved that their sons and daughters  are no longer kicked off their insurance policies when they turn age 22 or  graduate from college and cannot now  stay on their parents\u2019 insurance plan  until the age of 26. As a result, if their  20-year-old child gets sick or hit by an  automobile or another terrible accident, they can get care without the  family going bankrupt.  You will hear from moms and dads  with kids who have cancer, asthma, diabetes or other preexisting conditions  telling you they\u2019re relieved that finally  insurance companies can\u2019t deny their  children  coverage  because  of  preexisting conditions. And you will hear  from senior citizens who are unable to  pay for the huge prescription costs of  their bills, and then as of January 1 of  this year, they are getting a 50 percent  discount and they can afford to pay for  the medicines their doctors say they  need.  You will hear from small businesses.  The number of small businesses using  the tax credit has exceeded everyone\u2019s  expectation. You will hear from those  small businesses saying they can now  afford to purchase affordable coverage  for their employees and, as a result,  hire more people. You would hear all  that and more.  That is why it is such a mistake, it\u2019s  an historic mistake,  to  take away  these patient protections and throw  these  individuals back over  to  the  whims and the many abuses of the insurance  industry. There\u2019s no  doubt  that the  insurance  industry will be  popping  champagne  bottles  if  the  health care  law was ever to be repealed. Let\u2019s put the interests of our  constituents, patients and consumers  first in this debate.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I yield myself an  additional 30 seconds.  And let\u2019s make sure that as we do  this, we tackle the deficit and the debt.  I listened to my colleague talk about  the debt, but we all know that the  independent,  nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office  in a  letter  to  Speaker BOEHNER dated January  6,  2011, indicated that repealing this bill  will increase the deficit by over $200  billion over the first 10 years and by  another $1.2 trillion over the second 10  years.  b1510  Our colleagues have criticized those  findings, but they\u2019re the same people  who they applauded when the numbers  came back their way.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker,  I yield 2 minutes to a new member of  the committee but a senior Member of  Congress,  the gentleman  from California (Mr. CALVERT).  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in support of H.R. 2, a bill that  would  repeal  the disastrous government takeover of health care.  The more we learn about the new  health care law, the more we understand how devastating it will be to our  economy. Already employers across the  country  have  suffered  increases  in  their health premiums as a result of  the health care law, yet we were told  that the  law would bend the health  cost curve downward.  We were told that the bill would reduce the deficit by $143 billion over 10  years. However, we now know that the  figures given to the CBO did not accurately  reflect  the  law\u2019s  real  costs.  When you add back the $115 billion  needed to implement the law and subtract the bill\u2019s double-counting of revenue and other budgetary gimmicks,  the true cost is a staggering $700 billion over 10 years.  We were told the bill would protect  the uninsured; yet all it does is roll  them onto Medicaid\u2014a low-performing  program that has resulted in more people turning to the ER for their medical  needs.

            "14": "H218  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE January 18, 2011  and Access Reform Today Act of 1993  introduced by Senator Dole and Senator Chafee. The requirement of individual participation was valid  then,  and it is valid now.  For all of these reasons, I strongly  encourage my colleagues to vote \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019  on this misguided repeal bill.  Mr. Speaker, following is my statement in its  entirety:  I rise in opposition to the Republican effort  to deny 32 million Americans health care, to  deny millions of middle-class Americans  the  ability to get health care insurance if they have  pre-existing conditions, and to drive up our national debt by an additional $1.4 trillion over  the next 20 years.  Last March, I had the distinct pleasure and  honor of voting  for  the Affordable Care Act,  which achieves many of the goals I have been  fighting for my entire adult life.  The Affordable Care Act will stave off the 55  percent of personal bankruptcies caused by  health care emergencies. By banning rescissions, banning the \u2018\u2018pre-existing conditions\u2019\u2019 insurance bar, banning annual and lifetime coverage caps, and capping annual out-of-pocket  expenses, this law ensures that nobody will go  broke because they get sick.  When fully implemented more than 32 million additional Americans will have access to  health care coverage. This translates into saving  the  lives of  the 45,000 Americans, who  now die every year because they lack health  insurance.  In addition, the Affordable Care Act extends  greater  rights and benefits  to women. No  longer can insurance companies discriminate  against women by charging women higher  rates  than men  for  the same coverage. No  longer will women be denied coverage because  insurance companies consider pregnancy, C-sections, and being the victim of domestic violence to be pre-existing conditions.  No longer will women go without critical maternity care coverage, access to mammograms,  and other key preventive care services\u2014services that will be available without co-pays and  deductibles. Ending these routine, disgraceful,  and patently unfair practices are a tremendous  victory for women and children.  For America\u2019s seniors, the Affordable Care  Act strengthens the Medicare program. Seniors will no longer pay out of pocket for preventive services, and  the cruel donut hole,  which forces seniors to choose between taking  their drugs or going without, will be closed.  And by cracking down on fraud and waste, the  Act ensures that those who seek to take advantage of our seniors and steal  from  the  Medicare program will no longer have a free  ride.  The Affordable Care Act also benefits America\u2019s young people. Often without the option of  employer-based health insurance, young people now can stay on their parents\u2019 health plans  until their 26th birthday.  And owners of small businesses will get billions of dollars in tax credits to help them provide health coverage to their employees\u2014unless, of course, the Republicans are successful  in enacting a massive  tax  increase on  small businesses by repealing this law.  We did all this and more while reducing the  deficit by what CBO now estimates will be  $230 billion in the first ten years, and $1.2 trillion in the next ten years.  Mr.  Speaker,  when  our  predecessors  passed similarly historic laws such as Social  Security in 1935 and Medicare and Medicaid  in 1965, they knew the measures would require further consideration. In the years since  those  crucially  important  programs  were  signed into law, Congress has made, and will  continue to make, improvements to those programs. And that is the key\u2014to make improvements to the law. Instead of spending our time  looking for ways to build on and perfect the  health care reform law, Republicans want to  take a sledgehammer to it, to throw out everything, without any consideration at all. No matter that our economy still needs our attention.  No matter that millions of Americans remain  out of work.  The Republicans say the bill is an unprecedented or unconstitutional expansion of Congressional power. They are wrong. There  is  nothing radical, dangerous, or unconstitutional  about the Act, through which Congress is regulating the vast interstate health and insurance  markets in a number of ways that protect the  American people. We have the power to enact  this comprehensive plan,  including  its minimum coverage requirement, under the Commerce, Necessary and Proper, and General  Welfare clauses of Article I, Section 8 of the  Constitution.  Similar  attacks  were  levied  against the Social Security Act of 1935. They  were unsound and rejected then and will fare  no better today.  We  require citizens  to participate  in programs\u2014like Medicare and Social Security\u2014  when necessary  to accomplish an objective  wholly within Congressional powers, and there  simply is nothing so surprising or severe in requiring similar participation\u2014by requiring that  those who can obtain insurance do so or pay  a  tax penalty\u2014in our comprehensive  framework for health care reform. Indeed, leading  Republican lawmakers championed individual  mandates as part of their Health Equity and  Access Reform Today Act of 1993. The requirement of individual participation was valid  then, and it is valid now.  For all of these reasons, I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote NO on this misguided repeal bill, and instead, to say \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 to  guaranteeing health care for 32 million more  Americans. To say yes to enabling millions of  Americans with pre-existing conditions to obtain health  insurance. To say yes  to ending  gender rating and rescissions. To say yes to  allowing parents to cover their adult children  on  their health care plans. To say yes  to  strengthening Medicare for our seniors. To say  yes  to growing our economy by supporting  small businesses. To say yes to reducing our  deficit.  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I  yield 2 minutes to the chairman of the  House Administration Committee, the  gentleman from California (Mr. DANIEL  E. LUNGREN).  Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, in the scope of the  American  constitutional  system  of  governance, the Congress is the body  whose power is defined within the context of enumerated powers, and this is  more than a matter of structural mechanics because it goes to the heart of  the issue of governmental power, or if  one prefers the flip side of the coin,  personal freedom and responsibility.  If government has the power to require that you buy item A, it means  that you are less able to buy item B, C,  D or anything else.  Now, economists would call this the  opportunity cost of foregone goods or  services, but the fundamental question  is the question of freedom to choose  how we as individuals will spend the  fruits of our labor.  Certainly the commerce clause lacks  the elasticity that would accommodate  a  requirement  that every American  buy health insurance which conforms  to the dictates of the Federal Government,  as  the  Federal Government  would change it on a yearly basis. Such  an interpretation would render the notion articulated by James Madison and  Federalist 45, that is, one of limited  government, a nullity.  Now, I know we have smart people  here. I know we have those in the administration who believe that this is  totally  constitutional;  but,  frankly,  Mr. Speaker, my bet goes with James  Madison.  He did say that the powers delegated  by the proposed Constitution of the  Federal Government are few and defined. He did say that the Federal Government will be exercising their responsibilities principally on external  objects as war, peace, negotiations, and  foreign commerce and the States would  do much else.  Then, of course, we have the 10th  Amendment, later adopted, which said,  again, that this is a government of limited enumerated powers. Now, either  the 10th Amendment means something,  or it means nothing; and either James  Madison knew what he was talking  about, or he does not.  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to yield 1 minute, and I congratulate the ranking member of Government Reform,  to  the  gentleman  from Maryland, ELIJAHCUMMINGS.  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise  before you in fervent opposition to the  bill we are considering today. I have  heard from many of my constituents  and  small business owners who are  grateful for the benefits of this law.  Children with preexisting conditions  are no longer being denied access to  private  health  insurance. Maryland  small businesses offering health insurance to their employees are eligible for  a 35 percent tax credit.  Further, as ranking member of the  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,  I note that repealing  this law would also eliminate the new  private health plan currently providing  coverage  for many uninsured Americans with preexisting conditions.  I find it repugnant that Republicans  want to strip Americans of this law\u2019s  protections that will save the lives of  our fellow citizens.  I urge a \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 vote on this bill.  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. GOHMERT).  Mr. GOHMERT.

There is a financial  incentive to pay your employees less  because the tax credit that we talked  so much about last year goes away as  you pay your folks more.  In fact, it is almost as if the folks  who wrote this piece of legislation last  year either have no  idea how small  business works or they don\u2019t care how  small business works. Either way, the  current health care  legislation  is a  complete disaster for small business,  and the number one priority for small  business this year should be repealing  of the existing health care and passing  of H.R. 2.  Ms. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker,  in the State of South Carolina as a result of this repeal  legislation, small  businesses in the State of South Carolina will see a tax increase of $540 million.  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE).  Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentlelady for yielding.  Madam Speaker,  I  rise  strong opposition to H.R. 2.  We know that if we repeal this law,  we know the following things will happen: Children with preexisting conditions will be denied coverage; adult  children under the age of 26 will be denied coverage under their parents\u2019 policy; seniors will pay more for their prescription drugs; and small businesses  will once again go back to paying nearly 20 percent more than their corporate  counterparts  for providing the same  health care coverage; small businesses  would lose the incentive for providing  coverage to their employees and an up  to 50 percent tax credit which has already  increased  coverage  at  small  firms by more than 10 percent. They  would lose the ability to grow their  businesses and create  jobs by using  that tax credit to hire additional employees.  This law establishes consumer protections,  incentivizes wellness  programs, and establishes cost controls  and cost-cutting exchanges. For small  businesses, that means driving down  the cost of providing health insurance  and providing assistance for small businesses that are struggling with skyrocketing premiums.  Currently, small businesses pay, on  average, 18 percent more than  large  businesses for the same coverage, and  health insurance premiums have gone  up three times faster than wages in the  past 10 years.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Ms. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.  b1650  Mr. CICILLINE. Small business tax  credits are critical to providing small  businesses the opportunity to provide  insurance to their employees. We made  a promise to those small businesses to  do everything we can to make it easier  for them to thrive in this economy, and  this is a good first step.  I urge my colleagues to vote against  this repeal.  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam  Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from  Tennessee  (Mr.  FLEISCHMANN).  Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speaker, tonight I rise in support of the repeal of ObamaCare.  This is my first speech on the floor as  a Member of Congress, and I thought it  only appropriate that  it be on this  topic\u2014a topic I campaigned hard on  and a topic I believe strongly in.  We must repeal this health care legislation. As a small business owner for  the past 24 years, I know firsthand the  kind of damage this legislation would  do to American small business if it is  allowed to be put in place.  The National Federation  of  Independent  Research  Foundation  conducted a study that showed the employer mandate  found  in ObamaCare  could lead to a loss of 1.6 million jobs  throughout the country, and 66 percent  of those lost jobs would come from the  small business workforce. That same  study showed \u2018\u2018small businesses would  lose, roughly, $113 billion in real output and account for 56 percent of all  real output lost.\u2019\u2019  As a member of the Small Business  Committee, I promise to use my personal experience to fight every day for  small  business  owners  everywhere.  Starting  tonight,  we must  repeal  ObamaCare.  Ms. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. MILLER).  Mr. MILLER  of North  Carolina.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak  against this bill.  Even before the recession, my State  of North Carolina was losing one wave  of jobs after another in our traditional  industries, and we have needed the energy and the job creation that comes  from small business\u2014from people leaving  jobs, whether they  jump or are  pushed, and starting their own businesses. Half the American economy,  our gross domestic product,  is generated by small business. Even more  importantly, small businesses create 75  percent of new jobs.  By providing access to State high-  risk pools and an insurance market for  individuals, the health care reform bill  passed last year will make it possible  for American workers to start their  own businesses without worrying they  are going to lose health care for themselves or for their families.  I do know firsthand what it is like as  a small business owner to buy health  insurance for employees. It is one of  the  greatest  frustrations\u2014trying  to  find something affordable and trying to  figure out what you really bought, and  you\u2019re not going to know until one of  your employees gets sick or gets hurt.  This bill, the bill passed last year\u2014  this legislation\u2014will make it affordable. It will provide tax credits of 35  percent for small businesses to provide  health insurance, and that is going to  go up to 50 percent. That will increase  health care coverage by more than 12  percent amongst small business owners. Even more  importantly, they\u2019re  going to know what they\u2019ve got. It is  going to be insurance that really covers what it ought to cover. It is not  going to be filled with small-print exceptions of one kind of care after another, one condition after another. Employees are going to get the care they  need.  Reform has freed people who want to  start a business to do it without worrying about what kind of shape  it\u2019s  going to leave them in and their family  members in.  I urge my colleagues to vote against  this bill, which will put those small  businesses back into uncertain land.  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam  Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute  to another member of the Small Business  Committee,  the  gentlewoman  from  Washington  (Ms.  HERRERA  BEUTLER).  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam  Speaker, I rise in support of this bill,  and I hope this is only a first step in  the pursuit of making quality, affordable health care available to all Americans.  This year we have the chance to correct mistakes made by both parties.  The ObamaCare bill passed by  the  other party last year was the wrong approach. It increases the debt and the  deficit  for  future generations while  doing nothing to decrease the  inflationary curve of health care. It was the  wrong approach.  No party is perfect. The last time our  party had the majority, while there  were many on our side of the aisle who  worked  diligently  to  reform health  care, the job was left undone. Getting  this right is one of the reasons the people of southwest Washington sent me  to Congress. Now, the good news is that  solutions exist that can fix our health  care system and bring costs down for  middle-income families. Today, we hit  \u2018\u2018reset\u2019\u2019 on health care reform.  I invite my Democratic colleagues to  join me  in advancing solutions that  help small businesses and middle-income  families\u2014solutions  like  small  business health plans, ending junk lawsuits that drive up the cost of everyone\u2019s care, the expanded use of health  savings accounts, and the ability to  purchase  health  care  across  State  lines.  These are patient-centered solutions  that won\u2019t grow government, but are  solutions that will make health care  more affordable and more accessible to  all Americans. I sincerely hope we vote  today to seize this chance.  Ms. VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I  would like to inquire as to how much  time remains on both sides.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York has 121\u20444minutes remaining. The gentleman from  Missouri has 15 minutes remaining.

            "30": "H234  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE January 18, 2011  a report that they released recently entitled \u2018\u2018ObamaCare: A Budget-Busting,  Job-Killing Health Care Law.\u2019\u2019 I have a  copy of it here if anybody wants to get  it. All you have to do is contact the  Republicans.  Mr. Speaker, in the last Congress, we  took up  the challenge of  reforming  health care in this country because the  system was broken and creating tremendous  damage  to  the American  economy. The fact is the health care  law will help the economy. It will result in more efficiency, more stability  of care, healthier Americans, and at  fairer costs. That\u2019s what the law will  do.  Republicans have repeatedly misused  statistics  from  the CBO  to  support  their argument that the  law  is primarily a \u2018\u2018jobs killer.\u2019\u2019 We are truly in  a situation of Republican conclusions  desperately in search of honest facts.  Let\u2019s look at the typical example\u2014  the Republicans\u2019 twisting of the views  of experts to support their view. On the  very first page of the report House Republicans released on January 6 entitled  \u2018\u2018ObamaCare,\u2019\u2019 Republicans state  that according to a nonpartisan CBO  report from August 2010, the law will  result in a loss of 650,000 jobs. Now you  can get that from the CBO. It\u2019s available for people to read. But if you actually go to what they cite from the CBO  report\u2014it\u2019s on page 48\u2014the report really says that the economy will use less  labor because many people will choose  to work less, or retire early, as a result  of the benefits of the new law.  Let me read the exact quote from the  Republican report. It says, \u2018\u2018the nonpartisan CBO has determined that the  law will reduce the amount of labor  used in the economy by roughly half a  percent,\u2019\u2019 an estimate that adds up to  roughly 650,000 jobs. The Republican report, however, deliberately chops off  the last part of the CBO sentence to  substantiate their claim. Here is the  entire  sentence:  \u2018\u2018The Congressional  Budget Office estimates that the legislation, on net, will reduce the amount  of  labor used  in the economy by a  small  amount\u2014roughly  half  a  percent\u2014primarily  by  reducing  the  amount of labor that workers choose to  supply.\u2019\u2019 CBO explicitly makes clear  that jobs will not be lost but instead  that people will choose to work less in  order to have a decent life. With the  new health care law, the American people won\u2019t be drowning in health care  costs and risks to their coverage.  Some evening, on Friday, fly home to  Seattle with me and meet the flight attendants from United Airlines. We have  the oldest base in the country. Most of  those women are working so that they  can have health care benefits for their  family because their husband has a job  and no health care benefits. They\u2019re  not flying for the pension. They\u2019re not  flying for the salary. They\u2019re flying to  keep their health care benefits until  they can get to Medicare.  The Republicans want to  focus on  their message\u2014no matter what  the  facts are. Republicans say that health  care reform is bad for American business. The National Business Group on  Health, a collection of nearly 300 large  employers including Wal-Mart, Lockheed Martin and others, disagrees and  says repeal will be bad, bad for businesses.  I will close by quoting, in a somber  splash of honesty, the economics editor  of the Wall Street Journal. On January  6, just 2 weeks ago, he wrote:  Talking about repeal of the health  care law\u2014remember, this is the Wall  Street Journal\u2014talking about repeal of  the health care law may be a winning  political strategy  for Republicans, a  rare way to please both workers and  business executives, and here is what  they finally end with\u2014as long as they  don\u2019t actually succeed in doing it.  The health care law isn\u2019t a job killing bill. It\u2019s good for business, it\u2019s good  for American taxpayers, it\u2019s good for  consumers, it\u2019s good for everybody in  the society, and I urge my colleagues  to recognize that words really do matter  and  they  should  stop  mischaracterizing the health care law  and confusing the American people.  f  BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman  from  North  Carolina  (Mr.  JONES) is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, today I had  the honor and privilege of visiting the  wounded warriors at Bethesda Naval  Hospital. Each one of the young men I  saw, the oldest being 23, is very special,  as are all of our men and women in uniform.  The medical staff at both Bethesda  and Walter Reed  is  truly amazing.  They have done a wonderful job repairing the broken bodies and spirits of our  young servicemembers.  The number of wounded warriors returning  from war has become more  prevalent with the  increased use of  IEDs by the enemy. More and more of  our young men and women are returning without their arms and legs. Tonight, Mr. Speaker, as a constant reminder of the pain of war, I show you  this picture of a young triple amputee  and his wife. This man gave his body  for this country and will struggle for  the rest of his life. How many more  will have to return home in this condition?  This young man and his wife have  just returned from the hospital. He is  in a wheelchair. He lost an arm and  two legs and he is looking at a beautiful American flag that was on the  wall that had been drawn for him.  It is time we declare victory and get  our troops out of Afghanistan. It is evident that President Karzai does not appreciate our commitment. If he did, he  would not be so corrupt. If he did, he  would not have made the comments  that he now has three main enemies\u2014  the Taliban, the United States and the  international community as stated in  the Washington Post on December 13.  He said that if he had to choose sides  today, he would choose the Taliban.  The Taliban are killing American service men and women.  Mr. Speaker, I have joined DENNIS  KUCINICHas well as many other members of both parties in the hope that  President Obama will keep his promise  to start withdrawing our troops in July  of this year.  b1920  In closing, I would like to urge the  American people to get engaged in this  cause and to let their Members of Congress know how they feel. They must  encourage the Members of Congress to  vote to bring our troops home. The  pain must end, and we can easily declare a victory and bring our brave  men and women home.  Mr. Speaker, as I do all the time on  the floor of the House when I speak, I  ask God to please bless our men and  women in uniform, to bless the families  of our men and women in uniform. I  ask God in his loving arms to hold the  families who have given a child dying  for freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq. I  ask God to please bless the House and  Senate that we will do what is right for  the American people. I ask God to give  strength,  wisdom,  and  courage  to  President Obama that he will do what  is right for the American people. And  three times I will ask God please, God  please, God please continue to bless  America.  f  SMART SECURITY  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a  previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. WOOLSEY)  is recognized for 5 minutes.  Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, our Nation is now in its 10th straight year of  war. The military occupation of Afghanistan is longer than any war in our  Nation\u2019s history. An entire generation  of young people\u2014including my three  grandchildren who came with me to  visit Washington for the swearing in\u2014  is growing up knowing nothing but a  Nation at war.  This war is not just a moral abomination with devastating human costs,  and it is not just fiscally irresponsible  and unsustainable with a price tag of  about $370 billion, though it most certainly is all of that. Perhaps the most  tragic irony of this war is, for all of the  sacrifice, it is not even doing what it  was supposed to do: keeping us safe and  defeating a terrorist threat.  If Iraq and Afghanistan have proven  anything to us, Mr. Speaker, it is that  we need an entirely new national security model; one that emphasizes brain  over brawn; one that uses soft power  instead  of hard;  one  that  protects  America by relying on the most honorable American values\u2014love of freedom,  desire for peace, moral leadership, and  compassion for the people of the world.  With these values in mind, this week I  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:26 Jan 19, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K18JA7.074 H18JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",
            "38": "H242  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE January 18, 2011  run its course so that it was not treatable, 30,000 to 40,000 Americans every  year.  b2020  That is not the way America should  be. We should be providing insurance to  all Americans.  On the floor today, the debate commenced, and I was pleased and a bit curious to hear my colleagues on the Republican side talk about repeal and replace. And as they talked about what  they would replace, I began to say, Excuse me. Wait a minute. What you\u2019re  replacing is already the law in America. The health care bill that became  law this year deals with every American from birth through their school  years, through their years of building a  family,  in  their  employment  and  through their retirement. It deals with  the entire cycle of life by providing the  opportunity for health insurance, improved health insurance, at every stage  of life.  Let me show you how that works. It\u2019s  the Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights, which apparently  our Republican  colleagues  want to repeal. The Patient\u2019s Bill of  Rights is a fundamental reform of the  insurance  industry.  I was  insurance  commissioner for 8 years in California,  and I understand the insurance industry very, very well. And it\u2019s about profit. All too often, the health insurance  industry puts profit before people. In  doing so, they deny coverage. The Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights goes directly to  this issue of insurance companies putting profit before people.  Let me show you where this works.  Children. My very first speech here on  the  floor as the health care debate  came up in 2009, in November of 2009, I  spoke to an individual, a friend of ours  who lives here in Washington, whose  child was born with a very serious kidney problem. The mother was covered  by  insurance through the pregnancy  and through the delivery. The moment  it was discovered that that child had  this preexisting kidney ailment, they  dropped the coverage on the child. The  family  struggled  and  continues  to  struggle to provide care for that child,  limping along trying to get the money  together for the next procedure to provide the services that are necessary\u2014  the transplant.  All of those things should have been  covered by insurance, but with the insurance company putting profit before  people,  they denied  that child coverage. The Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights  stops that and says that every child  has a right to coverage, no longer the  kind of discrimination that took place  here with my friend\u2019s family.  Secondly, young adults. I happen to  have had six young adults. All of them  have passed through the age 23, and  that  period  where  their  coverage  stopped was the scary time for us in  our family, and it is for every other  family in America. At the age of 23, insurance  companies were allowed  to  drop patients\u2019 coverage. And if you\u2019re a  23-year-old and you have any kind of a  preexisting condition, you\u2019re out of  luck. The Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights guarantees that that young woman or man  will be able to get coverage until the  age of 26. And  if they have a preexisting condition, that can no longer  be a reason to deny coverage. The Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights would be repealed  by the piece of legislation that will be  brought to this floor tomorrow.  If you are a woman, you have a preexisting condition. It is called being a  female. And routinely\u2014and I\u2019ve seen  this during my tenure as  insurance  commissioner. Routinely,  the  insurance companies would deny coverage  because you are a woman and you  might get pregnant or you might have  any number of conditions. That will no  longer be the case.  If you happen to have cancer, you  cannot be denied coverage. The Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights protects every  single American when it comes to getting insurance and keeping insurance.  Many other provisions are  in this  bill, and I find it astounding that our  colleagues  on  the Republican  side  would  repeal  the Patient\u2019s Bill  of  Rights and literally open every single  American up to the gross discrimination that the insurance companies have  foisted upon Americans  for decades  putting profits before people.  There are many other parts of the  Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights, but I want to  just take a moment and invite to this  conversation my colleague  from the  great State  of New Jersey, FRANK  PALLONE, who has been fighting this  fight for decades both as a Member of  Congress and as a concerned citizen.  Mr. PALLONE, if you will join with us,  share with us your thoughts and your  experiences, and we will continue on  with this discussion. I yield.  Mr. PALLONE. Thank you. I want to  thank you for all that you do on this  issue. I have seen you come to the floor  so many times over the last year or  more talking about the importance of  the health care reform and now, of  course, pointing out how ridiculous it  is to try to repeal it, which is what the  Republicans are going to try to do tomorrow.  I just want to start out by saying  that we were just home for the Martin  Luther King weekend, and so there was  an opportunity to talk to a lot of people at the various Martin Luther King  events over the 3 or 4 days that we  were home, and the issue is jobs. That\u2019s  all people want to talk about. Everyone comes up to me and says, What are  you going to do about the economy?  What are you going to do about jobs?  Nobody  talks  about  repealing  the  health reform bill.  And what I get basically from my  constituents is they know the health  reform bill passed. They know that it\u2019s  kicking in. A lot of the patients\u2019 protections that you mentioned have already kicked in, and they want to see  how it goes. Even those who were not  necessarily  for  it  in  the beginning  think it is a complete waste of time for  us to be rehashing the debate and talking about repeal because they want to  see what is actually going to happen  with the health care reform. And to the  extent  that  they have  seen certain  things, protections, kick  in,  they\u2019re  happy with it. And what they say to  me is, Look, if over the next few years  if certain aspects don\u2019t work out, then  you can go back and revisit  it and  maybe make some changes. Nobody is  suggesting we can\u2019t make changes on a  bipartisan basis. But this idea of just  repealing it outright when it just went  into effect a few months ago, almost no  one I talked to is in favor of that. They  just don\u2019t think that makes sense.  The other thing that I wanted to say,  and  I keep stressing over and over  again\u2014I actually have this chart, and I  know you pointed to it as well\u2014is: Who  is going to actually gain from the repeal? We know that insurance companies keep raising their prices. We know  that historically they try to discriminate by eliminating people who have  preexisting conditions or by having  lifetime caps on insurance policies. The  only ones that gain from this repeal  are the insurance companies because  essentially they can go back to the situation, to the status quo where they  can  have  double-digit  premium  increases. You know, in your own State  of California, it wasn\u2019t unusual to have  a 30 percent  increase.  I think Blue  Cross just announced a 50-something  percent  increase. And so they make  money by constantly raising premiums  and also by discrimination.  In other words, if you have a policy,  a woman, for example, that has breast  cancer and then she has a recurrence,  well, if she reaches the cap on coverage  for the year or the cap on coverage for  a lifetime, then she has no insurance to  cover her reoccurring cancer.  Or the other thing is that sometimes  they even rescind a policy. If they can  find some way to say that it didn\u2019t  apply to you, they would simply rescind it altogether, and you\u2019d get sick  and wouldn\u2019t have  insurance at all,  even when you thought you had the  greatest need for it.  So I just want to stress, this chart  says GOP patients\u2019 rights repeal would  put  insurance  companies  back  in  charge where children with preexisting  conditions are denied coverage, young  people aged 26 can\u2019t stay on their parents\u2019 plan, pregnant women and breast  and prostate cancer patients could be  thrown off insurance rolls\u2014that\u2019s the  rescission\u2014seniors pay more for their  drugs.  The bill, as you know, has, for those  in the doughnut hole, until this bill  went  into effect,  if you reached the  doughnut hole, then you had to pay 100  percent  for your prescription drugs.  You got a $250 rebate last year. As of  January 1, you have a 50 percent reduction, and that\u2019s going to eventually become zero so you will have complete  coverage under Medicare part D.  So, if you repeal it, seniors are going  to pay more for their drugs. And that\u2019s  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:26 Jan 19, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K18JA7.094 H18JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",
            "46": "H250  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE January 18, 2011  It\u2019s actually costing the taxpayers a  lot of money, Mr. Speaker, because if  people don\u2019t have insurance, that does  not immunize them from getting sick.  b2140  We\u2019re all going to get sick one day.  We\u2019re all going to need medical care.  We\u2019re all going to, at some point, need  the care of a doctor or a nurse. And it  costs money. And if we don\u2019t have insurance, it can\u2019t be paid for. So people  without insurance don\u2019t get access to  the health care system until they get  so ill that they have to go to the emergency room. And at that point, taxpayers have to subsidize that cost. And  so it stands to reason that with 17 percent of our gross domestic product  being spent for medical care in this  country, and the fact that that has an  impact on our interstate commerce, it  means that the Federal Government  certainly has a role to play in regulating the health insurance industry.  And that\u2019s exactly what we did.  I want to now recognize, or flip it, if  you will, back to my good friend from  the Virgin Islands.  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. I want to thank  you, Mr. JOHNSON, for helping to clarify some of the important areas that  are provided for in the Affordable Care  Act. Everyone is entitled to their own  opinions, but not everyone is entitled  to creating  their own  facts. And  I  think what we\u2019re hearing tonight are  the facts.  I would like to yield now 5 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Texas, Congresswoman SHEILAJACKSONLEE.  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I thank  the gentlelady. It is a pleasure to be  able to join my colleagues on the floor,  including  Congressman  MEEKSof New York, who we\u2019ll have the  opportunity to hear from, and I thank  for your continued  leadership, and my colleague on Judiciary Committee, we had  the opportunity  to  contribute  to  the debate  today.  The Judiciary Committee has as its  jurisdiction the Constitution, and our  friends on the other side of the aisle  keep talking about that this is unconstitutional. It baffles me and almost  frustrates me because I\u2019m trying to  grab hold to what the argument is, particularly since we have had Medicare  by the Federal Government since 1965,  and  it has withstood any constitutional challenge, and that was implemented under the Commerce Act.  But frankly, if we have an argument  to make on the Constitution, I will  share with you why this is clearly a  constitutional bill, because we are actually denying people both due process  and equal protection under the  law  under the present system because we  have a nation that is divided between  the haves and have-nots. Forty million-plus, 44 million, now I hear 32 million persons were uninsured. That\u2019s  what grabbed our attention. Those people did not have access to health care.  Clearly, if you look at the Constitution that says that the 14th AmendDr. CHRISTENSEN GREGORY  ment says equal protection under the  law, all people treated equally, and the  Fifth Amendment says can\u2019t deprive  someone of life or liberty without due  process. Well, I can tell you over the  time that we debated this bill we saw  the numbers of people who actually  died because they could not get access  to health care. We are reminded of our  good  colleague,  Congressman  CUMMINGS, who told the story over and  over again of a young teenager, 12- or  13-year-old boy, African American boy,  who had an abscess, a tooth abscess,  and clearly could have been saved, his  life was before him. But he died because his mother did not have insurance or really did not have access to go  anywhere  to  have  this  particular  health matter taken care of. It became  a crisis, and he died.  So I want to say to my friends, these  are the basic points that I want to  raise today while I discuss this question of the 14th Amendment and the  Fifth Amendment. First of all, you  hear the question of how offended people are, I don\u2019t want to be told to buy  insurance. Why should I have to be  forced to buy insurance? Well, as everyone knows, there is a 10th Amendment that says what is not left to the  Federal Government  is given to the  States. States require you to have auto  insurance. If you do not have it, you  are fined. You get a ticket. Because  they have calculated that the burden of  not having health  insurance  is  too  great to bear. And so when we think of  people not having health insurance because they don\u2019t have access, we have  determined  that  the  burden  is  too  great to bear, $143 billion if this bill is  repealed right away, and $1 trillion  over 20 years that we will lose, or the  deficit will be built. And I would imagine it might be more if you determine  the people that will be uninsured who  will go on to the county system.  Does everybody know in these districts around the Nation who are complaining about this bill that your hospitals, your county hospitals that are  burdening your local taxpayers will be  actually compensated  for uncompensated care? I don\u2019t know about anyone  here, but I can tell you my hospitals  are jumping for joy.  And so I just want to point this out.  Children with preexisting conditions  are denied coverage, that is the sickle  cell child, that is the individual with  heart disease. We determined  in our  Democratic Policy and Steering Committee that children are the greatest  that have the possibility of dying because of lack of coverage. And so all of  these children, asthma, parents who  have children with asthma, they are  born, and there are babies with asthma. Do you realize they cannot or  could not get insurance even on their  parents\u2019 insurance? Asthma. How many  children have died with asthma? Particularly in the minority community,  where we have been subjected to poor  quality  living conditions. Maybe the  air quality, because of where we live,  industrial waste, or maybe  it  is because of the quality of the house that  you are  in, asbestos, other ailments  that create conditions that cause respiratory illnesses in children, those are  respiratory illnesses, young people age  26. A young man by the name of Andrew today said he\u2019s been working very  hard, he graduated from college, but  unfortunately the job that he had offered to him has been pushed back because of the economy. He is working to  get more experience as an intern with  no compensation. His family cannot afford to keep him on to pay for independent insurance at this point. But  yet he is being constructive, and he can  be constructive because he can be on  his  parents\u2019  insurance.  Pregnant  women and breast and prostate cancer  patients, in particular, African American women and minority women have  a devastating form of breast cancer.  My father had prostate cancer, and at  the age he was and the atmosphere  that we were in and the medical access  he had at that time, one, he didn\u2019t tell  the family, two, we were uninformed  about this thing called prostate cancer,  and we didn\u2019t find out about it until it  had metastasized. My father actually  had lung cancer and brain cancer.  There  is  a  statistic: An African  American male over 65 that did not  have the proper access to health care  to be able to catch his prostate cancer.  Now this bill will provide for preventive care so that members, no matter  what economic station you are in or  status you are in, you have the ability  to access health care, meaning you can  go to a community health clinic or the  community health centers, excuse me,  or you may be able to buy your own  health  insurance at the rate  in the  amount you can.  There is a complaint here, as I said,  about lacking the ability or not wanting to buy health insurance. Well, I  would argue to that person, the argument I made about the 10th Amendment and automobile insurance, but I  also argue, would you  rather have  these  individuals die or burden  the  massive  public  health  system?  Or  would you rather have them have access to be healthy as opposed to being  sick?  Then something has been said, job-  killing bill. And one of the points that  the Republicans make is 650,000 jobs  lost. They are not telling the accurate  story. The 650,000 jobs lost are people  deciding not to work or to work less  because they now have the ability to  get their own insurance that is not tied  to a job through the exchange. That is  the accuracy of it. It\u2019s voluntary, voluntary separation from a job because I  am independent now to be able to go  into  business,  to  be  a  sole  entrepreneur, a sole proprietor, and still  have my insurance. And so these people  would immediately be thrown off because a pregnant woman would be considered a preexisting disease; breast  cancer, obviously one of the more devastating diseases; prostate cancer.

KAY GRANGER  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 18, 2011  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  offer my congratulations to the TCU Horned  Frogs  football  team  for  their 21\u201319 victory  over the Wisconsin Badgers in the 2011 Rose  Bowl. Quarterback Andy Dalton was named  the Rose Bowl\u2019s Most Valuable Offensive  Player, while  linebacker Tank Carder was  named the Defensive MVP.  The Rose Bowl attendance of 94,118 was  the largest crowd to ever attend a TCU football game. Excluding the NFL, the 2011 Rose  Bowl Game was  the most-watched event  in  ESPN and cable television history. In addition  to an outstanding performance  in  the Rose  Bowl game, TCU posted its third straight top-  10 ranking this season, and its fourth top-10 in  the  last  six  seasons. TCU\u2019s 13\u20130 overall  record was the second undefeated season in  program history.  The 13 wins mark the most victories in a  single season for TCU. As any college football  fan knows, breaking  into a BCS game  is a  huge  accomplishment  for  a  non-automatic  qualifying school, and  I am proud  that  the  Horned Frogs became the first non-automatic  qualifying school to play in and win the Rose  Bowl. With  this  feat, TCU has proven once  again that they can play with any college football team in the Nation.  TCU had five first-team All-Americans: linebacker Tank Carder, defensive end Wayne  Daniels, safety Tejay Johnson,  return specialist Jeremy Kerley and center Jake Kirkpatrick. Jake Kirkpatrick won  the Rimington  Trophy as the Nation\u2019s top center.  Congratulations  to  the  team,  the coaches,  and the staff for an outstanding year and an  incredible  performance  in  the Rose Bowl  game. The Horned Frogs have made TCU  and the entire Fort Worth community proud.

            "4": "S374  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE February 1, 2011  glidepath to enactment. But the American people had a different idea.  Our national unemployment rate was  10.2 percent\u2014the highest in 26 years.  The American people understood that  at a moment of historic economic challenges, the last thing the country needed was another budget-busting entitlement and sky-high taxes.  And just about 1 month later, this  message was delivered again. In a new  shot heard across the world, our colleague, the junior Senator from Massachusetts, SCOTTBROWN, was elected in  a very clear referendum on the Democrats\u2019 health care bill.  The verdict of the American people,  if the previous summer\u2019s townhalls left  any doubt, was now crystal clear.  The push for ObamaCare must end.  Yet, the administration refused to  yield.  They thought the people would eventually come to embrace the elegance of  ObamaCare. If only the messaging was  better, Americans would appreciate all  of the good things that Washington  politicians and bureaucrats had to offer  them.  So after taking time to regroup and  weigh their options, Democrats decided  to defy the American people yet again.  A little over a year ago, the President hosted a summit at the White  House and began his final push for his  federalizing of American health care.  The  resulting  display  was  ugly.  Americans, already  revolted by  the  deals cut in this Chamber to secure the  bare number of votes needed to pass  the bill, now witnessed historic arm  twisting and desperate efforts in the  House  to  deny  the  obvious\u2014that  ObamaCare  represented  an unprecedented intrusion of the Federal government  into the  lives of citizens and  clearly was a massive burden on taxpayers.  And so it passed.  And ObamaCare became law.  And  the administration  set about  writing the thousands of pages of regulations that would govern how American businesses provide health benefits  to their employees.  Fast forward to November of 2010.  The American people did not forget  their snubbing by self-proclaimed progressive Democrats who in fact ignored  the will of the people at every opportunity during the ObamaCare debate.  At voting booths across the country,  they made clear to those congressmen  and Senators who provided the votes  for this job-destroying health care bill  that such high-handed, illiberal behavior was not acceptable in a democratic  republic.  Fast forward one more time.  Yesterday, barely  13 months after  ObamaCare passed the Senate, and less  than one year since it became law, the  entire scheme was struck down in Federal court.  In a triumph for both personal liberty and the American Constitution,  the individual mandate was found unconstitutional  and  ObamaCare  was  struck down.  in  Not part of ObamaCare.  All of ObamaCare.  Not surprisingly, the administration  and its special interest allies responded  with the same derision toward ordinary  American citizens that has been on display throughout this debate. Instead of  acknowledging  the  obvious\u2014that  ObamaCare represents a massive departure  from  any  traditional  understanding of limited government\u2014White  House officials went on the attack,  calling  the decision outside of  the  mainstream  and  ridiculing  its  reasoning.  Really?  Millions and millions of Americans  believe that provisions essential to the  operation of ObamaCare are unconstitutional intrusions on personal liberty  that vastly expand the power of the  Federal government.  They understand that the justification  for  the  individual mandate by  ObamaCare\u2019s proponents essentially removes any limits on the power of the  Federal government to regulate personal and economic decisions.  Twenty-six  states  participated  this challenge to ObamaCare.  Thirty-two Members of this body, including myself, signed an amicus brief  challenging  the  constitutionality  of  ObamaCare.  But, according  to  the administration\u2019s narrative, we are the ones who  are out of the mainstream.  This administration came into office  buoyed by the good will of the American people and carrying banners of bipartisanship.  Two years later, after the politically  disastrous decision to overhaul one-  seventh of the Nation\u2019s economy with  virtually no Republican support, they  are blaming the victim.  After a Federal judge looked at this  tough issue and determined that key  elements of ObamaCare represented an  unprecedented  and  unconstitutional  expansion of the national government,  the problem remains\u2014as it always is  for liberals\u2014the people.  Their views are  just not sophisticated enough  to grasp ObamaCare\u2019s  consistency with a government of limited and enumerated powers.  The Democrats continue  to  think  that  if  only  they  focus  group  ObamaCare better, they will get the  messaging right.  The American people will learn to  love it.  I don\u2019t think so.  The American people get it. I know  my constituents in Utah do.  In an article yesterday in \u2018\u2018Politico\u2019\u2019,  Patrick Caddell and Douglas Schoen  highlighted the reasons for the public\u2019s  deepening disdain for ObamaCare. According to them, it is possible that no  major piece of legislation \u2018\u2018has created  the continued, vehement public opposition  that health care has provoked  since  the Kansas-Nebraska Act  of  1854.\u2019\u2019  In their view, \u2018\u2018[t]here is one big underlying factor that continues to cause  cost  of  many Americans to oppose the health  care bill: Its passage was anti-democratic. If the Republicans\u2019 campaign  slogan of 1854 was the Crime Against  Kansas, in 2010 it would be the Crime  Against Democracy.\u2019\u2019  Americans know that the Senate bill  was 2,074 pages long.  They know it authorized 70 government programs.  They know it delegated regulatory  power  to  the Obama administration  1,697 times.  They know it cut $465 billion from  Medicare at a time when  it already  faced a $38 trillion unfunded liability.  They know the bill took from one already unsustainable entitlement to pay  for a brand new entitlement.  They know it raised taxes by over  $550 billion, repeatedly violating the  President\u2019s pledge not to raise taxes on  middle class families.  They know ObamaCare will destroy  695,000 American jobs at a time when  millions of Americans are looking for  work.  They know the Medicaid expansions  threaten to bankrupt the States, with  CBO estimating that the Medicaid expansion will cost American taxpayers  $435 billion over 10 years.  They  know  the  total  ObamaCare is $2.6 trillion.  And they know we can not afford it.  To borrow from Justice Scalia, the  American people despise ObamaCare  because the American people love democracy and the American people are  not fools. They know that this law was  enacted in a totally partisan manner,  and over the loud opposition of a majority of Americans.  And they know that the partisans  promoting ObamaCare were not, and  are not, forthright when they say it is  budget neutral.  ObamaCare  cuts  hospitals.  It cuts $202 billion from 11 million  seniors on Medicare Advantage.  It cuts nearly $15 billion from nursing homes.  It cuts nearly $40 billion from home  health agencies.  It cuts nearly $7 billion from hospices.  But  these  cuts  don\u2019t  go  toward  strengthening Medicare,  a  program  with catastrophic unfunded liabilities.  Rather, Democrats poured the savings  from these cuts back into a brand new  entitlement program.  Furthermore,  so-called  comprehensive health care reform managed to neglect the pressing need for a permanent  doc fix. Yet, CBO\u2019s most recent estimate is that a long-term doc fix freezing Medicare payment rates at 2011 levels would raise the deficit by $249 billion, not counting an additional $53 billion in debt service obligations.

Mr. President, I  thank the Senator  from Texas very  much  for  letting me make a brief  statement about the amendment I am  about to offer, and apologize for interrupting her comments.  What we have today  is an opportunity\u2014an opportunity\u2014for the majority to reevaluate what it has done on  the issue of health care and to take another path. It is no secret the American people don\u2019t like the health care  bill that was passed last year. If you  have talked with doctors or nurses or  anybody else involved in health care  over the last year, most of them will  tell you they do not like it either. Employers, big and small, have been desperately  trying  to get  the message  across of how damaging this bill will be  to their ability to create jobs. They  tell us the impact of the bill is severe\u2014  higher taxes, penalties for hiring workers, new regulations that have already  run  to more  than  6,000 pages, and  mountains of new paperwork all at a  time when businesses want to create  jobs and millions of Americans are  looking for one.  Don\u2019t take it from me. Here is how  the National Federation of Independent  Business puts it:  Small  business  owners  everywhere  are  rightfully concerned  that  the unconstitutional new mandates, countless rules and  new taxes in the health care law will devastate their businesses and their ability to  create jobs.  Yesterday, a Federal court in Florida  found the crux of the law to be unconstitutional. So we have an opportunity  today\u2014an opportunity  for all  those  who supported the health law\u2014to reevaluate your vote and to  listen to  your constituents, who are desperately  trying to get your attention. You can  say, perhaps, this was a mistake, we  can do this better or you can continue  to dismiss the majority of the people in  this country as not knowing what they  are talking about.  It is not every day that you get a second chance on a big decision after you  know all the facts. Today is one of  those days. For all of us who opposed  the health care bill, today we reaffirm  our commitment to work a little harder to get it right. We can\u2019t afford to get  it wrong.  I urge my colleagues to move beyond  party affiliation. Look at the facts before us. If everyone in this Chamber  evaluated this bill for what it is, we  would repeal it right now, and then we  would begin to work on achieving our  mutual goal of delivering health care  at a higher quality for lower cost. Let  us not miss this opportunity.  AMENDMENTNO. 13  Mr. President, I send an amendment  to the desk, and I ask for its immediate  consideration.

Mr. President, I  am pleased we are starting on the FAA  bill and having an open amendment  process so everyone can be heard. I will  finish my  remarks, as  the  ranking  member of the Commerce Committee,  and then I know Senator STABENOW  wants to speak on the first amendment  that is going to be offered. It is probably unrelated to our FAA bill but nevertheless  is very  important  for our  country.  Let me go back to where I was on the  part of the FAA reauthorization bill  that addresses aviation safety. We do  limit the ability of FAA inspectors to  work for air carriers over which they  have had oversight, and we will require  the conducting of independent reviews  of safety issues identified by employees.  We also need to require enhanced  safety oversight of foreign repair stations,  including a minimum of  two  FAA inspections annually, with exceptions for those that have comprehensive bilateral aviation safety maintenance  agreements with  the United  States, and requiring alcohol and drug  testing at any foreign facilities that  perform maintenance on U.S. commercial aircraft.  Finally, the bill also provides infrastructure investment to our Nation\u2019s  airports. As we all know, you can have  the best planes and the best air traffic  system but they mean nothing without  the proper airport  infrastructure  in  place.  This bill contains many  important  provisions and deserves the support of  the Senate.

            "20": "S390  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE February 1, 2011  that would  then be  substituted  for  what we created and  the President  signed? And  then very quickly one  comes to the realization that there  isn\u2019t an alternative  from  the other  side. There never has been. From that,  it quickly follows that the deduction is  what they want is the present system.  If that is not true, then they can come  down and tell me about that. That is  what  I  have  to  believe  because  I  haven\u2019t heard the new ideas or the alternatives to what it was we worked on  and accomplished over a very difficult  period  of many months  and much  angst, agony, and screaming at townhalls and all the rest of it, which was  worth it.  The bill, although not perfect, was a  real step forward. It looks at the fee-  for-service system, which has always  been a fallacy in the American health  care system, that you automatically  get paid for whatever you do if you are  a doctor, a hospital, or you sell medical  equipment, no questions asked. You  don\u2019t save money, you don\u2019t improve  health care by doing  that. Productivity, efficiency, and excellence are  done by oversight, by accountability,  by asking questions, asking people to  show, through the evidence of what  they have done for a particular service,  that it is better than it was the year  before.  I will mention\u2014unpleasant probably  and not fit for this floor\u2014that one of  the biggest problems we have in health  care today is something called MRSA.  MRSA is in almost every hospital in  the country. Unfortunately,  it emanates  from bathrooms  that are not  kept that clean. So if we don\u2019t do our  bill and  it  is repealed and hospitals  then are not  judged on MRSA and  many other things, such as too many  MRIs in one hospital, too many MRIs  in one town that can only support two  but has seven because you have to  make money off of them but they are  not used very much\u2014all of these have  to be checked and looked at carefully  before people are paid. That is the way  you save money, and that is the reason  the health care bill that was finally  signed saves $1.3 trillion over 20 years  and $240 million or $280 million in the  very first year. It is a cost saver.  So, by definition, if we went back to  the present system, you would have to  start with the fact that we would be  losing those savings and therefore adding it onto our deficit. So we would  have $1.3 trillion more in deficit over 20  years, et cetera, et cetera. It is unwise.  But then cost isn\u2019t absolutely everything. We understand that. The Senator from New Hampshire understands  that. We have to use good judgment.  Then you look at the public option,  which didn\u2019t work, and then you look  at the medical loss ratio. Folks don\u2019t  know what that is\u2014even some in this  body. It is a simple system where you  simply say\u2014and  it will disappear  if  Senator  amendment  passes\u2014that health insurance companies are required to spend 80 percent of  MCCONNELL\u2019s  all\u201485 percent if it is a large institution or, if it is a small business or an  individual,  80 percent\u2014they have  to  spend  that percentage of  their premiums they collect on health care, and  then they have to show to HHS that it  is being  spent on health care  that  makes Americans better or at  least  keeps them where they are. The bathrooms get cleaner, to be crude about it  but actually quite accurate about it.  That is a very good system because it  is not sort of mandating; it is called  oversight. The American people should  want to do oversight over their health  care dollars because it is so much of  their income they have to spend on  health care. The medical loss ratio\u2014a  strange name but a sound principle\u2014is  where 85 or 80 percent of all premium  dollars have to be spent on health care,  and health care cannot just be health  care but better than it was in the previous year or 2 or 3 years. Obviously,  we are not into that system entirely  yet and won\u2019t be until 2014.  Is it possible for me to explain that I  am very disturbed that this bill we are  now wanting to repeal will insure 32  million people who don\u2019t have health  insurance, and then I am saying to myself that there are a lot more than that  who are uninsured in this country, but  that is all we could afford to do because we didn\u2019t have enough money. So  let\u2019s say it is really 45 million and then  decide there are many millions more  than that who are underinsured. You  may be dealing with 50 million people,  and all of a sudden, their prospects for  getting  health  insurance  disappear.  They simply disappear because we repeal the bill.  Now, truth in telling, the 32 million  people\u2014we weren\u2019t going to be able to  get that all done until 2020 because of  the  lack of  funds. We had to do as  much as we could as soon as we could,  but we couldn\u2019t do more than that because we didn\u2019t have the money. Everything was scored by CBO, which is very  tough. But I am astounded by the prospect of the excellent people who are on  that side of the aisle\u2014they are like us;  a different party, but so what\u2014saying  that 32 million would lose their health  insurance\u2014or they were going to get  health  insurance, but now they will  not, so they are on their own.  What happens then? Well, they take  up the practice, which I saw first when  I was chairman of the Children\u2019s Commission for 4 years in the early 1980s or  the late 1980s\u2014we went out to Chicago  in one visit, to Cabrini-Green, and Chicago was a robust health care city, and  the folks out there told me that in that  particular  year,  eight  emergency  rooms  in hospitals had closed down.  Why? Because they were being overwhelmed even then.  Secondly, they are by far the most  expensive part of the hospital. They  cost the most. They drain health care  because of all the emergency service.  People wait 5, 6 hours\u2014we have all  been through  it\u2014and they get their  health care, maybe. It is so inefficient,  so brutal, such an awful system where  more attention, because of health insurance, would allow more cautious,  attentive, logical work to be done on  patients. That is gone. That is simply  gone.  Emergency rooms are important, but  a lot of them are going out of business  because they still cannot afford to stay  open. They are too expensive for the  hospital corporation that makes that  decision. I do not blame them for that.  I know my colleague wants to speak.  I think of when I was a VISTA volunteer\u2014I sometimes talk about that on  the floor\u2014a long time ago. There were  no jobs, no health care. Nobody went to  school because the schoolbus did not  come to pick up any of the kids because we were considered too far away.  It was kind of a bad community. I  latched on to that community. It is the  reason I went to West Virginia and  then stayed in West Virginia.  They depended on a rural community  center. It was right next door, the Lincoln County Community Health Center. It was not a hospital so they did  not have to worry about going up in an  elevator because many of them in very  rural parts of the State have not been  in an elevator before, have not crossed  a traffic light, red or green. That is  new to them. They live in rural places.  They deal with it that way. I suspect it  is true in parts of New Hampshire, although New Hampshire has gotten sophisticated.  People  trust  rural health centers.  Why? Because they are not hospitals.  They are on the first floor. They are an  old Kroger store, an old Safeway store,  an old hardware store. But inside are  doctors, nurses, and now health  IT,  which is in this bill and heavily promoted, which may be coming on its  own, but I doubt it.  This  bill  is  really  important  to  health  IT. They could communicate  with any university, any medical center, not just in West Virginia but in  the world. They can get experts to look  at, let\u2019s say, a mole on a 14-year-old\u2019s  arm. Is that just a mole or is that cancer? I have seen that done. A doctor at  West Virginia University\u2014this was 20  years ago\u2014I can\u2019t believe that\u2014looking at a kid in Moscow with a physician assistant attending. They put the  then-technology on that mole. The doctor in West Virginia was able to analyze  it and say  it  is not cancerous.  That was a wonderful event.  People gravitate to community centers. Poor people gravitate to them.  Rural people gravitate to them. They  are easily accessible. They have very  good doctors. There is a lot in the bill  to help with those kinds of doctors,  those kinds of nurses, the staff, those  kinds of places and the whole health IT  issue which makes the work they do  there checkable, accessible anywhere  else in the State, the country, or in the  world. Those would be gone.  We have $10 billion in our bill for  1,000 new community health centers all  across America.

That is  all in our human nature.  What we have failed to do is to address the real cost drivers. That cost  driver is: There is no connection with  my purchasing of health care with the  actual payment of health care. How do  we know if we connect it, it works?  Go to any place in the country that  has Amish  folks. They do not have  health insurance\u2014none of them. They  do not buy health insurance. What do  they do? They are grand consumers and  very discretionary consumers of health  care because they come forward and  they want to know what they are getting and what it costs before they buy  it, every time. I have delivered over 500  Amish babies, and there was not one  time I wasn\u2019t asked at the time the patient came to see me: What is the price  for this? Will you take a cash payment  up front so I can buy for cheaper? Are  there some other places where I can get  the tests done? Every test I ordered, I  would be questioned on whether they  absolutely needed the test. They were  discretionary  purchasers  and  very  sharp in their discretion on how they  wanted to pay for health care. Consequently,  their  cost  for  the  same  thing was 40 percent less than anybody  who walked in with insurance.  So we have totally missed this connection of market  forces allocating  scarce resources by making discerning  consumers out of  the purchasers of  health care. We have gone exactly the  other way. We have taken people who  are at 133 percent of poverty and said:  You are going into Medicaid, and by  the way, you can\u2019t buy private insurance even if you want to. You have to  be  in Medicaid\u2014a  far  substandard  health care  system. All  the  studies  show the outcomes are poor, even after  you equate for social disparities. We  are going to put 18 million into that  program, and we are going to have a  shortage of over 100,000 primary care  doctors in this country in the next 10  years. So who is going to see them?  Let me give another example. It happened  this weekend. A  patient\u201490  years of age\u2014severely bent over from  kyphoscoliosis, bad aging and kyphoscoliosis, is running a fever and can\u2019t  breathe well. She goes to the ER. She  had seen a physician on Friday. She  had a chest x ray, and no pneumonia  showed. She goes to the ER that night.  She has a pulse ox of 81 percent. Normal is 93, 94 percent. They put her on  oxygen, change her antibiotics, and  send her home.  Well, what happened? Had we not  interceded\u2014I personally as a physician  making a call to another physician\u2014  she would be dead by now because what  she had was a full-blown, raging pneumonia and restrictive lung disease, but  she was sent home from the ER because  a  physician\u2014not  a  doctor\u2014a  physician did not  see her. So consequently she goes back to the ER the  same night and is admitted to the hospital. They take a chest x ray, and all  of a sudden they see this full-blown  pneumonia. She had all the symptoms,  but the person seeing her in the ER  didn\u2019t have the experience to make the  judgment. So is that really what we  want? We want substandard care, so  somebody can go home and die versus  coming to the hospital? Today, she is  200 percent better. She is eating. Her  pulse ox, now on room air, is 91 percent.  We actually saved her life because a  real physician put hands on a patient  and made the right diagnosis. But we  are going to put people into a system  where that doesn\u2019t happen because we  are going to use physician extenders.  That doesn\u2019t mean they are bad; they  just don\u2019t have the same experience,  and people die when they don\u2019t have  the same experience. But we are going  to inflate the utilization of less than a  physician to care for the vast majority  of these people who are going into Medicaid.  These are real examples of what the  consequences are of what we have done.  As I started, I said I don\u2019t doubt the  intent of my colleagues  in terms of  what they were trying to get to, but  the biggest disease Washington has is  fixing the wrong problem. We have expanded health care access under this  bill, but access doesn\u2019t mean you are  going to get care. And when you add 18  million people to the Medicaid rolls,  let alone what is going to happen to  the States, ultimately, with the cost  on the maintenance of effort where  they have Medicaid now and we are  going to go to 133 percent, what you  have done is put the States in a pinch,  and they are in a pinch already.  So my question to my colleagues is,  Where are the things that drive the  costs down? Where  is the discerning  consumerism that allocates scarce resources in the most effective way? In  this bill, it is not there. Nowhere is it  there.  Now, what is there? What is there is  a tremendous amount of new taxes.  There is $52 billion over 10 years on employers who fail to comply with the insurance mandate; 40 percent excise tax  on high-cost health plans, $32 billion;  ban on purchase of over-the-counter  drugs from somebody\u2019s health savings  account, $5 billion; increased Medicare  tax on wages of small businesses, nine-  tenths of 1 percent; a 3.8-percent surtax  on investment income, and that is $210  billion; increase from 7.5 percent to 10  percent of income the threshold after  which you can make a medical deduction;  $2,500  annual  cap  on  flexible  spending account contributions\u2014and I  could go through this and through this.  The point is, we are increasing spending on health care by $2.6 trillion after  this is truly in play. Also, the gimmickry in terms of accounting and the  problems associated with  that have  been discussed on the floor.  One of the things that is there that  concerns me as a physician, getting  back to talking about patients, is cost  comparative effectiveness. It was really cheap to send that 90-year-old person home. There was an ER visit, a little bit of oxygen, a change in antibiotics. That was really cheap. Comparative effectiveness would have said:  Oh, that is OK\u2014except she would have  been dead in 24 hours.  Every physician who is maintaining  their license or their specialty certification studies comparative effectiveness every day. They read it in the  journals. They do it to get recertified.  They know the comparative effectiveness. What they don\u2019t know is that we  are going to mandate what they will  do, what is the cheapest\u2014not what is  the best, what is the cheapest.  Well, I will tell my colleagues, if you  look at heart disease in our country, if  you look at cancer cure rates in our  country, if you look at recovery rates  from massively serious illnesses in our  country from both trauma and otherwise, what you will see is the highest  rate of recovery in the world. We have  the highest 5-year survival rate on almost every cancer by 20 or 30 percent  over every other system in the world.  Do we really want to take that away?  In 2003, I was diagnosed with colon  cancer. I had metastatic colon cancer.  I am so thankful for the health care  system we had that generated new devices, that incentivized great care, and  after a major surgery where half of my  colon  was  taken  out,  radical  lymphadenectomy was carried out, and  6 months of chemotherapy, I stand before you today, 7 years after that. I  want to tell you, had I been in England  or Canada, my cure rate would have  been about 35 percent. Do we know  what it is in this country for somebody  with metastatic colon cancer?  It  is  nearly 70 percent. Now, what created  that? What gave us the technology to  do that? It is because we looked at the  best clinical effectiveness, not the best  price. We said: How do we best and  most effectively get an outcome of  cure?  This bill goes the other way. This bill  is going to be a mandate from Washington on what your doctor can do for  you, and it is also going to mandate  from Washington what price should be  paid. There is no question that, according to the trustees for Medicare, for us  to maintain what has been put in this  bill, Medicare  reimbursement  rates  will fall below Medicaid rates. Do we  really want that to happen? I will tell  my colleagues, for those in my condition, those people who are diagnosed  today with colon cancer, you don\u2019t  want that to happen.  Now, how do we get the cost down?  There is no question that there is tons  of waste in our health care system. We  have not  attacked  in  the way we  should attack\u2014and I can say as a practicing physician that I wasted money  caring for people because I didn\u2019t concentrate on  that  individual because  that individual wasn\u2019t paying the bill.

Marla decided to do something about  it, and she organized protests at the  U.S. Embassy  in Kabul,  rallied  the  media, and not long after was in Washington urging Congress  to help  the  families and  show  that  the United  States does not turn its back on innocent victims of our own mistakes.  It was because of Marla  that we  started a new program, now known as  the Afghan Civilian Assistance Program, ACAP, which is managed by the  U.S. Agency for International Development and implemented by the Afghan  staff of the International Organization  for Migration. Over the past 8 years,  ACAP has provided millions of dollars  in small grants to families and communities that have suffered losses as a result of the military operations. The  funds have been used for such things as  to rebuild a house that was damaged or  destroyed, buy a herd of sheep, start a  small grocery or weaving business, or  provide medical  care  or  vocational  training.  After  the  invasion of  Iraq, Marla  moved on to Baghdad and, to make a  long story short, again thanks to her  advocacy we started a similar program  there. Tragically, on April 16, 2005, she  too became an  innocent victim, and  died, along with her Iraqi colleague  Faiz Ali Salim, in a car bombing. That  program is now known as the Marla  Ruzicka Iraqi War Victims Fund, and  it has helped the families of thousands  of innocent Iraqi victims rebuild their  lives.  Earlier this week  I received  from  USAID  some  descriptions  of  recent  ACAP assistance to Afghan families.  While they describe exceedingly tragic  losses of innocent life, they also illustrate the difference a program like this  makes and why it is so important to  our larger goals in that country. I ask  unanimous consent that they be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  NORTHERNREGION  DAWRIRABATVILLAGE, CHARDARADISTRICT,  KUNDUZ  School teacher Ghulam Sakhi was shot  dead during a firefight between international  military forces and the Taliban. The incident  happened  in  the  village  of Nahri  Suf,  Chardara District, in February 2010. Ghulam  Sakhi was the breadwinner for his family. He  left behind his wife, four daughters and five  sons.  His eldest son Zabihullah is 20 years old  and a student. After the death of his father,  Zabihullah was forced to take responsibility  for his family. He decided to leave school in  search of work. He was unsure how he would  be able to support his family.  ACAP provided Ghulam Sakhi\u2019s  family  with a livestock business, together with the  full range of standard kits, plus a livestock  kit.  Zabihullah  said:  \u2018\u2018After my  father was  killed, life was very hard for us. We asked for  help from Allah. We were very happy when a  worker from ACAP came to interview us and  offered help. We were told we would be given  help setting up our own small business. We  chose a livestock business because my mother, sisters and brothers could take care of  the animals, leaving me with the time to resume my education. We sell the milk from  the cows to a dairy and make enough money  not to be worried. Without this help, my  family would find it very difficult to live.  Now we can earn a living for ourselves.\u2019\u2019  WESTERNREGION  ESHAQSULEIMANVILLAGE, INJILDISTRICT,  HERAT  Widow Zubaida lost her son during an air  strike on her village in October 2001. A total  of 26 civilians were killed and 62 injured in  the incident. Fourteen families suffered serious damage to their property.  ACAP was informed of the incident several  years later and recently completed a monitoring report in order to measure the impact  of assistance on one widow\u2019s life.  Zubaida had received a small  livestock  business. Her children and grandchildren received educational lessons. ACAP also provided Zubaida with the full range of the program\u2019s standard kits, which include household goods, as well as educational, tailoring,  and livestock items.  She told the ACAP monitoring assistant:  \u2018\u2018After the death of my husband in an IED  explosion in late 2000, my son Abdullah was  the only supporter of our family. He was running a shop and we could handle the difficulties of life. Abdullah and I were living in a  small rented house happily but it did not  last long.  \u2018\u2018One year later there was a conflict in  Eshaq Suleiman, where I am originally from.  We were bombarded due to the presence of  Taliban fighters in the area. In the morning  Abdullah left the house to work but he did  not come back again. After the death of  Abdullah I not only lost my son but my only  supporter.\u2019\u2019  She added: \u2018\u2018I was not able to pay the rent  any more so I left the house and went to live  in my daughter\u2019s house. I tried to find a job.  I did everything I could. I worked as a housemaid\u2014cooking, cleaning, and washing. Life  was passing with difficulties but then your  colleague came to meet me six months ago.  \u2018\u2018I received the livestock through which I  now earn my living. Before I felt that I was  a burden on my daughter and resting on her  husband\u2019s shoulder but now I have a source  of income that pays for the house expenditures. Farzanah  and Khalil Ahmad, my  granddaughter and son, are enjoying the education assistances of your office. They are  both attending an English course. I received  all the needed equipment for keeping my  livestock. Receiving  the  assistance  from  ACAP has changed my life and that is why I  am really grateful for this program.\u2019\u2019  Another  victim  of  the  incident whom  ACAP has helped is mother-of-three Rezagul.  She lost her husband in the fierce bombardment. Rezagul has two sons and one daughter. After her husband died, her eldest son  Gul Ahmad, who was 13 at the time, was  forced  to abandon  school  to become  the  breadwinner for the family. He tried his best  to continue his education in his spare time  but it proved too difficult for him.  He was  responsible  for  financially  supporting his mother as well as his younger  brother Basir Ahmad and sister Sima Gul.  He knew that if he did not work full-time  then his family would face severe hardship.  An ACAP field assistant assessed the family\u2019s requirements. A small business grant  was approved which was used to set up a grocery shop. Rezagul\u2019s daughter Sima Gul received English lessons. ACAP also provided  standard kits.  Sima now helps her brother run their family grocery business. She packs the dry fruit  which is sold to export companies. Rezagul  told how she no longer has money worries.  She said: \u2018\u2018My husband was the only financial supporter of the family. Losing him was  extremely difficult. My son did not have a  fixed job.\u2019\u2019 She added: \u2018\u2018We always wanted to  have a family business where my younger  son and I could help in the absence of my  eldest son. But we could not afford that. But  we have been given that opportunity through  your generosity.\u2019\u2019  NORTHERNREGION  OMARKHILVILLAGE, ALIABADDISTRICT,  KUNDUZ  An ISAF air-strike on two oil tankers captured by the Taliban resulted in a high civilian death toll. It is estimated that 70 civilians were killed and dozens injured. ACAP  has helped 59 families affected by the incident. One beneficiary said that assistance  from ACAP helped prevent up to 600 men  from  joining the Taliban. The air-strikes  took place in September 2009 in Kunduz province. The Taliban had hijacked two NATO oil  tankers but one of the vehicles became stuck  in mud at a riverbank. German forces called  in air support and a U.S. Air Force F\u201315E  was dispatched to destroy the tankers. Local  villagers had flocked to the abandoned tankers in order to siphon off fuel. They were  mistaken for insurgents.  One of the affected families which ACAP  helped is that of widow Lailoma. When her  husband was killed in the air-strike, she was  left unable to financially support her five  children.  Lailoma had to rely on friends\u2019 charity  until ACAP stepped in. Lailoma received the  full range of standard kits, which include  household goods, as well as educational, tailoring, and livestock items. Lailoma decided  to use her ACAP small business grant to buy  a pick-up truck. She teamed up with a business partner and now the business generates  enough money so that she can comfortably  support her family.  f  CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY  MONTH  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise in celebration of Black History Month and to acknowledge the  unique contributions of Colorado\u2019s African-American  communities  to my  home State and our Nation.  The history of Colorado\u2019s African-  American communities  is  long, rich  and diverse; it spans from our earliest  days as a territory to modern times. I  think it safe to say that all Coloradans  have benefited tremendously from African-American communities\u2019 hard work  and dedication to continuously making  Colorado a better place to live.  Last year in my remarks on Black  History Month, I made special note of  the diversity of settlers who moved  west  during  the  expansion  of  the  United States. Like other settlers, African Americans moved west in search  of new opportunity\u2014some to be free,  others to become entrepreneurs, traders, and leaders, but all played an active role in the formation of Colorado  as a territory and then a State.

            "44": "S414  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE February 1, 2011  Our deficits are unsustainable and  our debt is out of control. This bill  takes a very measured approach, gives  us time to figure things out. It is not  like the ridiculous proposal over in the  House where we are going to cut $2.5  trillion this year. Anybody who thinks  that is going to happen, I have a tutu  you need to wear down the hall tomorrow. That  is a  ridiculous proposal.  That is impossible to do. But this bill  is possible and responsible. This puts  us on a glide path to say to the American people that our spending is going  to be capped at a certain percentage of  our economic activity in this country.  That is possible, and it is responsible,  and we should do it.  Who  is to blame? Let\u2019s be honest  about how we got here. The biggest factor in our deficits the last 2 years is  our poor economy. I know, I know; you  would think it is the stimulus. You  would think it is TARP. It is not. Political cheap shots but not true. The  biggest fiscal hole we are facing is because of the poor economy.  The biggest increase in spending in  the last 2 years? You would think it  was the auto bailouts or you would  think it was the bank bailout or you  would think it was the stimulus. It was  not. Do you know what the biggest increase in spending was over the last 2  years? Unemployment benefits because  of our bad economy. That was the biggest increase in spending over the last  2 years. Our fiscal hole has grown primarily because of a bad economy over  the last 2 years.  But there also have been bad decisions by both parties over the last decade. When Clinton  left  office,  our  debt\u2014he may have been running a surplus in terms of the deficit, but our  debt was $5.7 trillion. When Bush left  office, he had doubled it from $5.7 trillion to $10.6 trillion. And today it is $14  trillion.  Over the past decade, we have had  two wars we did not bother to pay for,  a  brandnew Medicare  entitlement\u2014  brand  spanking  new\u2014that was  not  means tested. We are buying Warren  Buffett\u2019s prescription drugs. Go figure.  Like we are busted and we are buying  multihundred-million-dollar  billionaires prescription drugs, and we did not  bother to pay for it. We have had increases  in discretionary spending by  both parties that increased our deficit  and exceeded inflation.  I want to talk a minute about the  boogie man of the TARP and the stimulus. I am so sick of that being blamed.  It is so wrong and factually incorrect.  We have tax cuts that go on forever  that have contributed to this. We have  wars that we are fighting that have  contributed to this. We have entitlement programs that are not paid for.  But the stimulus was a one-time expenditure.  It  is not something that  goes on. It has no tail.  Anyone who understands economics  and understands the balance sheet of  the U.S. Government knows this problem was not the stimulus. One-third of  the stimulus was tax cuts. The last  time I looked, unpaid-for tax cuts were  the way of the world. One-third of the  stimulus was tax cuts. Another third of  it, almost, was unemployment benefits.  That is not the problem. And TARP?  Let\u2019s be honest. It was a genius decision in many ways because it stabilized  our financial sector, and it has cost us  a mere fraction of the money that was  used on a temporary basis to make  sure our economy did not twist down  the drain, as it was likely to do had  President Bush not intervened with his  economic team to ask us on a bipartisan basis to do something that was in  the best interest of our Nation.  We can move on as to who  is to  blame because now we have to talk  about tomorrow\u2019s problems. I am proud  the President  is dealing with short-  term spending by his freeze. I am proud  he is working on earmarks and all of  the other things that are a symptom of  the disease around here. But our challenge  is  long-term  spending.  In  the  long term, spending is going to drive  the debt up even higher. Medicare and  Medicaid cuts are going to double by  2021. Social Security  is going to  increase by 70 percent by 2021.  We have to look at those issues and  make sure on a bipartisan basis we do  what is responsible. We have to make  sure these programs\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security\u2014are stable  and secure for my children and their  children. If we cannot agree even on  the modest measures such as the 3-year  discretionary  spending  cap  Senator  SESSIONSand I have been pushing for  over a year,  I question whether we  have  the discipline  to do  the hard  work. Getting control of spending is  very hard, but we have to do it, and we  have to do it now.  First and foremost, we need to focus  on  eliminating  the waste and mismanagement.  That  is what  drives  Americans crazy. It drives people crazy  that we are spending money on duplicative programs and we are not even  checking to see if they work. It drives  them crazy when the Federal Government runs huge deficits and we are  paying out $55 billion in improper payments at Health and Human Services  and $12 billion of improper payments  by Treasury to people who do not even  qualify.  It drives Americans crazy when we do  not make the reforms our auditors recommend. The Defense Department has  1,200 suggestions that have been made  by our government auditors about how  it can manage its money and its programs better, and they have not acted  on almost 1,200 of them. It drives people crazy we are running deficits when  we have Departments such as the Agriculture Department and Homeland Security  that get  failing management  grades  for  8  straight years. And  it  drives people crazy when we are running deficits and we are passing appropriations bills with $15 billion worth of  earmarks.  I have been working hard to try to  clean up all this waste. We have been  working on contract management.  I  have never requested an earmark.  I  voted against every omnibus appropriations bill that has come to the floor  since I have been a Senator, and I have  worked hard for the last year with Senator SESSIONS to cap spending. Now I  look  forward  to working hard with  Senator CORKER and many  of my  friends  in  the Republican Party  to  work on the Corker-McCaskill bill to  put a cap long term on spending in the  Federal Government.  As I say, this is a bold step. It has  risks. And if this bill is distorted and  twisted, it could cost me my Senate  seat. I will say that again. If this bill is  distorted and twisted, it could cost me  my Senate seat. But it is a price I am  willing to pay. It is a price I am willing  to pay for my country and, more importantly, it is a price I am willing to  pay for my grandchildren.  By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr.  and  SCHUMER, Ms. MIKULSKI,  Mrs. GILLIBRAND):  S. 247. A bill to establish the Harriet  Tubman National Historical Park  in  Auburn, New York, and the Harriet  Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park in Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot Counties, Maryland, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today,  on  the  first  day  of Black History  Month, I am proud to reintroduce The  Harriet Tubman National Historical  Park and The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical  Park Act. I am joined by Mr. SCHUMER,  Ms. MIKULSKI, and Ms. GILLIBRANDas  original co-sponsors.  The woman, who is known to us as  Harriet Tubman, was born in approximately  1822  in Dorchester County,  Maryland  and  given  the  name  Araminta, Minty, Ross.  She  spent  nearly 30 years of her life in slavery on  Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore. As an adult  she took the first name Harriet, and  when she was 25 she married John Tubman.  Harriet Tubman escaped from slavery  in 1849. She did so in the dead of night,  navigating the maze of tidal streams  and wetlands that, to this day, comprise the Maryland Eastern Shore landscape. She did so alone, demonstrating  courage, strength and  fortitude that  became her hallmarks. Not satisfied  with attaining her own freedom, she returned  repeatedly  for more  than  10  years to the places of her enslavement  in Dorchester and Caroline counties  where, under the most adverse conditions, she led away many family members and other slaves to freedom in the  Northeastern United States. Tubman  became known as \u2018\u2018Moses\u2019\u2019 by African-  Americans and white abolitionists. She  is the most famous and most important  conductor of the network of resistance  known as the Underground Railroad.

Furthermore, with the reduction  of military force this will only increase, and  possibility lead to unrest among Veterans  and their families.  Thank you,  VINCENTTORREZ.  VINCENTTORREZJR.

The  Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. SPEIER) for 5 minutes.  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in opposition to this continuing  resolution,  a  continuing  resolution  that I call the silly, the dangerous and  the hypocritical. Budgets  are more  than just numbers. They are a statement of our values as a Nation.  As a Congress, we are faced with several serious challenges: growing our  economy, putting people back to work,  investing in the future, reducing the  deficit, and ensuring the most vulnerable in our society are protected. Judging on that criteria alone, this CR  doesn\u2019t pass the laugh test.  It would cut 300,000 private sector  transportation jobs, ensuring our construction workers are receiving unemployment checks instead of paychecks.  It would  stifle our  competition.  It  would stifle competitiveness by making Pell Grants less accessible to students and families. And it would run  roughshod over women, children and  the environment. With  such an extreme proposal,  I assume my good  friends on the Republican side would be  coming forward with ideas to improve  it. But what we\u2019ve gotten this week is  a combination of the silly, the dangerous, and the hypocritical.  In the silly department, we have an  amendment  preventing  funds  from  being used to repair the White House.  Now ironically right now, going on in  the Rayburn Building, are remodeling  of hearing  rooms  that  I guess  the  chairmen of  these committees have  found no need  to halt. How much  money is being spent there?  Or how about the amendment preventing  funds  from  being used  for  President Obama\u2019s teleprompter. Oh,  right. We\u2019re going to cut $3,000 from  the budget. That\u2019s really going to help  us.  I  would  expect  this  sort  of  hyperpartisanship on cable TV, but not  in a budget debate.  Under dangerous, we have: several  provisions gutting environmental protection, rolling back EPA regulations  on clean air and clean water, and reducing our investment in clean energy,  making America even more dependent  on foreign oil. How many more solar  in  panels do we want manufactured  China?  How about  the amendment undermining a third party testing requirement at the Consumer Product Safety  Commission? Great. So let\u2019s have Chinese companies pour in more tainted  toys, more  lead- and cadmium-filled  toys for our kids.  How about the reduction in funding  for our first responders, meaning there  will be less cops and less firefighters in  every single neighborhood in this country?  Or how about the amendment preventing funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, meaning  big banks can call the shots again?  Have we learned nothing from the financial meltdown over the last 3 years?  Or how about the unprecedented attack on women\u2019s reproductive health  which will result in more unplanned  pregnancies and more abortions; not  less.  And  finally, the category my colleagues on the Republican side seem to  relish  the most\u2014hypocritical.  The  party that ran on jobs has authored a  budget that would increase the unemployment rolls. Asked about likely job  losses  in  the CR, Speaker BOEHNER  said, \u2018\u2018Well, so be it.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s like Marie  Antoinette  saying,  \u2018\u2018Let  them  eat  cake.\u2019\u2019  The party that ran on cutting spending didn\u2019t take a scalpel to the defense  budget; they took a toothpick. In fact,  there\u2019s another $2.2 billion in the budget for the V\u201322 Osprey, which is basically obsolete; $495 million  for nine  Joint Strike Fighters; and $450 for a  second engine that the military defense  budget doesn\u2019t want.  And the party that ran on fiscal responsibility has offered a budget that  will balloon the deficit by continuing  tax cuts for the millionaires and billionaires that don\u2019t need them.  I agree with President Obama, that  we must out-innovate, out-educate and  out-build the rest of the world. While  not perfect, the budget he released this  week will take an important step in  that direction. As  for the silly, the  dangerous and the hypocritical CR we  are considering today, I urge my colleagues to vote \u2018\u2018no.\u2019\u2019  Budgeting is a serious process, and  what  we\u2019re  doing  this  week  is  unserious at least.  f  IMPARTIALITY AND THE SUPREME  COURT  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. MURPHY) for 3 minutes.  Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr.  Speaker, on a day that we\u2019re talking  about the continuing resolution, I want  to talk about a body that may someday  be judging the continuing resolution\u2014  the Supreme Court. There is perhaps  nothing more important to the preservation of our democracy than the continued guaranteed impartiality of our  Supreme Court. It\u2019s a uniquely American institution; it\u2019s been given enormous power  to  invalidate American  laws; and it needs to be dispensed with  complete blind justice, blind to outside  influence.  However, this Nation\u2019s confidence in  the blind justice of the Supreme Court  has been badly shaken recently by a series of revelations regarding possible  conflicts of interest by Justice Scalia  and Justice Thomas  in the Citizens  United case. This landmark 5\u20134 decision overturned  restrictions on corporate funding in elections that had  been  in place since 1947, and  immediately thereafter, millions and millions of dollars in shadowy special interest  group  donations  flowed  into  American campaigns. Two of the main  benefactors  of  these  groups  were  Charles and David Koch, billionaire  brothers who operate a Kansas-based  energy business. They spent about $2.6  billion that we know about in the 2010  election cycle and likely a lot more in  anonymous donations.  In addition to funding these outside  groups, they also organize a lot of conferences in which they gather people of  like mind to discuss their radical views  and plot strategies to benefit their interests. Now if I were to ask somebody  on a main street in my district if they  would be comfortable with a Supreme  Court  justice attending a conference  like this, having their plane flight and  the hotel all paid for by the special interests,  I know what  their  answer  would be. They\u2019d say, no way. Yet Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas did just  that and they thought it was just fine.  They didn\u2019t recuse themselves from the  Citizens United decision at all.  But here\u2019s the real problem. This  could be just an isolated problem to  the Citizens United case. Or it could be  much more widespread, with justices  conflicted on several fronts, refusing to  disclose their conflicts or recuse themselves when they have actual conflicts  of interest. But we have no idea, because right now there is no law requiring Supreme Court justices to disclose  their conflicts of interest as is required  of all other Federal justices.  b1120  I don\u2019t believe we should be meddling  in the day-to-day business of the Supreme Court. I get why there is great  wisdom  in separating  legislative and  judicial  functions.  But  there\u2019s  no  undue burden in just requiring sunlight  on Supreme Court proceedings.  So when we return to Washington  after the recess, I will be introducing  legislation to do just that, to implement a few reasonable reforms to add  greater transparency and disclosure requirements on the Supreme Court. I  hope my colleagues will join me.  My legislation will apply the Judicial  Conference\u2019s Code of Conduct to the  Supreme Court, which now applies to  all other Federal judges. It will require  the Justices to simply publicly disclose  why they\u2019ve recused themselves from a  VerDate Mar 15 2010  08:29 Feb 17, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K16FE7.017 H16FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",
            "20": "H956  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE February 16, 2011  The majority argues that we must  pass this extension now without any  process. It has also been alluded to  that there were not hearings in the last  Congress. There actually were. The Judiciary Committee held two hearings  on the Patriot Act in 2009. It has been  said, Oh, there hasn\u2019t been time to hold  hearings in this Congress because the  Judiciary Committee just constituted  itself. Well, they found time to hold 10  hearings on items that have not even  come  to  the  floor. So  surely  there  would have been time for one hearing  on an item that everybody knew was  going to expire and needed to be dealt  with.  Those of us who joined Congress in  the  last session as well as our new  Members this session, many of whom  are on the other side of the aisle, have  not had any classified briefings on how  this authority that has been given to  the Federal Government has been used.  How  can we  exercise meaningful  oversight with regard to these three  provisions of the Patriot Act, and the  Patriot Act in general, if we are not  given the benefit of finding out exactly  how these broad powers that have been  given to the Federal Government have  been used?  If this passes today\u2014and I expect it  might\u2014it is critical that we take the  next 90 days to make sure that Congress can properly execute  its oversight upon the next need for renewing  the necessary provisions of the Patriot  Act. There is a window of time that  will afford the Judiciary Committee to  do its work in a bipartisan way, which  is to include other Members through a  classified briefing to find out how and  when the powers under the Patriot Act  have been used, so that Members of  this body can make an informed decision, an informed decision about how  to move  forward  in 90 days  in protecting our rights as Americans and in  protecting our security as Americans.  The two are not irreconcilable, and we  cannot sacrifice what makes it special  to be an American in the name of security\u2014or the terrorists will have won.  I urge a \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 vote on the rule and  the bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.  GENERALLEAVE  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker,  I ask  unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to  revise and extend their remarks and to  include  extraneous material  in  the  RECORDon H. Res. 93.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there  objection to the request of the gentleman from California?  There was no objection.  Mr. DREIER. I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, we are where we are.  The Senate took our 10-month extension that we passed by a vote of 274\u2013144,  and decided to offer a 90-day extension,  which passed by an 86\u201312 vote.  Even before we saw this extension,  the gentleman from Menomonee Falls,  the  chairman  of  the  Crime  Subcommittee and the former chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, had made a  commitment that he will proceed very  vigorously in the next 90 days to deal  with the questions that my friend has  raised.  I think that many of the questions  that have been raised are valid. That\u2019s  why it is that we need to have this extension, which is scheduled to expire in  one legislative day if we take no action, because I think everyone can acknowledge that the Patriot Act has  played a role in keeping the United  States of America safe.  My two colleagues and I have joined  from the get-go in saying that they  should not have made this measure  permanent, because we were legislating  through the prism of September 11 at  the outset. We felt very strongly that  recognizing the civil liberties of every  single American has to continue to be  a very, very top priority while we look  at what, I think, are the five most important words in the middle of the preamble of the U.S. Constitution, which  are  \u2018\u2018providing  for  the common defense.\u2019\u2019  In his first inaugural address, Thomas Jefferson made it very clear when he  said that a wise and true government  shall restrain men from injuring one  another.  That is why our security has to be of  paramount importance, but it doesn\u2019t  mean it is done at the expense of civil  liberties and the rights of every American.  Well, guess what, Mr. Speaker? The  gentleman who chairs the Crime Subcommittee  is  absolutely  dedicated  within the next 90 days of pursuing  that as vigorously as possible.  b1300  I will say that when this extension  that we\u2019re faced with right now was  passed, last February 25, 1 year ago,  that brought to an end any discussion,  any hearings. That brought to an end  any hearings through the entire rest of  that Congress once the extension was  put into place.  I will  say  that any Member who  wants a classified briefing can request  it, and so the opportunity for classified  briefings on the Patriot Act or any  other measure is there for Members of  this body.  So, Mr. Speaker, it\u2019s clear to me, we  have a 90-day extension that has come  back from the Senate. It will expire in  one legislative day. We want Mr. SENSENBRENNERto begin working with Mr.  LUNGRENand others who have spent so  much time and energy in dealing with  the questions of the lone wolf and roving wiretaps and all that. We need to  have that addressed as quickly possible.  So let\u2019s do it, let\u2019s do it now, let\u2019s  pass this thing in a bipartisan way and  get it done.  I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on  the resolution.  The previous question was ordered.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  question is on the resolution.  The question was  taken; and  the  Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I  demand the yeas and nays.  The yeas and nays were ordered.

            "36": "H972  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE February 16, 2011  further  cuts  because  the  program  didn\u2019t have the funds to work in the  first place.  Madam Chairman, the EPA is working hard to protect us from pollution in  a responsible way that spurs the economy. This CR prohibits any  funding  from being used to carry out the EPA\u2019s  power plant pollution safeguards, the  rules  that  target  the  largest power  plants and prevent them from polluting  our air.  The rules also spur economic growth.  A recent study by MIT found that nearly 1.5 million jobs could be created by  simply  letting the EPA ensure that  over time power companies move towards cleaner power plants. That\u2019s 1.5  million jobs cut by this CR. Furthermore, this provision only harms an industry by giving  it  increased uncertainty and not allowing them to plan  for the future. In some cases, it might  even  lock up permits  from going to  companies that are a normal part of  business. We don\u2019t need sound bites; we  need sound policy.  The Clean Air Act guards the most  vulnerable Americans, those with asthma and other lung disease, children,  older adults, people with heart disease  and diabetes, from the danger, the real  danger of airborne pollutants, including threats from mercury, carbon dioxide and methane. Each year, the act  prevents tens of thousands of ill health  effects,  including preventing asthma  attacks, heart attacks and, yes, preventing premature death. This year  alone, the Clean Air Act will save more  than 160,000  lives, according to estimates by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Forty years of evidence shows that  these health benefits come not only  without harm to the economy but with  benefits to the economy. Since 1970,  the Clean Air Act has cut emissions by  60 percent. At the same time, the economy has grown by more than 200 percent.  Madam Chair, I implore the majority  party to stop making grand gestures  attempting to bully the EPA. Let it do  its job of protecting your family and  my family from dangerous pollution.  Let it do its job to keep our air and our  water clean.  This CR is a polluter\u2019s dream and a  public health nightmare. I urge a \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019  vote.  Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.  Madam Chair, I move to strike the last  word.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is  recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.  Madam Chair, we all  recognize  the  need for us to reduce the deficit and  curtail unreasonable spending, but this  continuing resolution obviously goes  far too  in the extreme direction of  harming our  economy and harming  many of the services that our citizens  have come to rely on to  finish and  bring  their  lives  together, whether  they\u2019re working, whether  they need  health  care, whether  their  children  need education, and this resolution is  harmful for that.  But I want to speak for the moment  on section 1475, which is a rider that is  added to this legislation that will harm  the California economy, harm our ability to plan into the future for the use  of water.  We have a water system in California  that\u2019s  dramatically  oversubscribed,  and we\u2019re in the process now of bringing that together to make sure that we  can meet the future economic needs of  our State and also the needs of the various sectors of that economy, whether  they be the fishing sector, they be the  energy producing sector, the farming  sector or the settlement of our cities.  But with this rider\u2014this rider, first  of all, throws out 18 years of litigation  successfully brought to an end, a long  conflict on the San Joaquin River to  provide for that settlement, a settlement that is agreed to by almost everyone. But more importantly, for the  sake of the long-term water using, this  amendment  defunds  the  biological  opinions that were going forward that  are the cornerstone to provide for the  final elements of the plan to provide  California and the apportionment of  that water for the protection of the  fisheries and the economies in northern  California,  for the protection  in the  water supplies of the Central Valley\u2019s  economy and the needs of the great  urban  areas  of  southern California.  That planning must be completed.  This is as close as we\u2019ve come. After  decades and decades of water wars in  the State of California, we finally have  the opportunity now to bring the various parties  together  from all geographic regions, from all sectors of the  economy, and plan the future of our  State so that we will have the water  that is necessary to secure our economy, to secure our families, to secure  our agricultural areas of the State, and  to provide for the great ecology of the  State of California.  We\u2019ve gone through some disasters, if  you will, because of the droughts, because of water cycles, and my colleague from further north in the State,  MIKETHOMPSON, laid out this. We saw  thousands of  jobs  lost, the  fisheries  decimated because of political water  decisions that were made over the last  several years that decimated the salmon run, not only affecting just the San  Francisco Bay delta but affecting the  coastal regions of our State and the  coastal regions of Oregon and Washington.  These are important fisheries. This is  an important part of our economy. It\u2019s  a renewable part of our economy if we  take care of it, but if we have mindless  riders that are put onto legislation like  the one provided in section 1475, it will  bring an end to these negotiations.  It\u2019s taken a  long time to get the  water parties from the south, the water  parties from industry, the water parties from agriculture, from the environmental community and the government,  the Federal Government and  State government together. They are  sitting at that table and they\u2019re working it through.  Just in the last couple of days, we see  the delta planning organization put  forth its first document to say what  the requirements will be for the conservation habitat plan that all of these  elements from north and south California working on. This amendment  simply kicks  that negotiating  table  over. It drives the parties away from  the negotiation, and California goes  back into water uncertainty, economic  uncertainty,  ecological  uncertainty  that our State cannot continue to have  if we\u2019re going to grow our economy, if  we\u2019re going to come out of this recession.  So I would hope that on passage the  Members would vote against this continuing resolution, understanding the  kind of damage that these kinds of riders that were inserted in the middle of  the night on behalf of a few special interests have the opportunity to really  destroy,  destroy  bipartisan  geographical negotiations  that are  the  most promising in the last 40 years in  the history of our State.  The opposition from so many of the  water users across the State, no matter  where they reside, to this rider is well-  known, to the fishing community, to so  many parts of our economy in the San  Joaquin-Sacramento Bay delta, and to  the future of our ability to get a handle  on  these  water  issues  that  have  plagued us for so many years in California. I would hope that we would reject this provision of this legislation.  b1530  Ms. MATSUI. Madam Chair, I move  to strike the last word.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman  from California is recognized for 5 minutes.  Ms. MATSUI. Madam Chair, we all  believe  in economic growth and  job  creation and environmental stability,  but this resolution goes in the wrong  direction and affects my State and district adversely.  Madam Chair, water in California is  never a dull subject. As we try to repair the delta and prepare our water  system for the generations to come, it  is imperative that we make progress  and not take steps backwards. That  means achieving a healthy delta and  finding a way for water users throughout California to receive their water  without harming the delta. The amendments  to  the  continuing  resolution  that defund and cut funding from the  San Joaquin River Restoration,  the  Central Valley Project Restoration  Fund, and the implementation of the  biological opinion of the delta smelt  and salmon are steps backwards.  The balance that we have been trying  to achieve in California is a negotiation that must not be thrown off balance. Decades of work toward a more  certain future for California water is  only attainable when everyone works  toward a solution rather than throw up  VerDate Mar 15 2010  08:29 Feb 17, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K16FE7.081 H16FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",
            "44": "H980  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE February 16, 2011  today, an agenda that punishes taxpayers and the American people at the  expense and for the profit of private oil  and gas interests in this country.  As we confront this issue, I would  suggest to my colleagues that the legacy of our public lands and our environment, the legacy of our clean air  and water, the public health of our people should be the priority. And if cuts  need to be made, then all cuts should  be placed on the table, all cuts should  be looked at, including subsidies and  including  giveaways  and  deductions  that are not part of the norm with our  public dollars. That would be good for  the taxpayer, and it would be good for  the environment, and it would be good  in reducing the deficit.  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman  from Massachusetts is recognized for 5  minutes.  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the underlying bill.  I was an early and strong supporter  of the President\u2019s bipartisan commission on the debt; and while I do not  agree with all of the commission\u2019s recommendations, I recognize that their  report to the President offered an important starting point for debate on an  issue that affects the  lives of every  American, as well as  future generations.  In the report, the commission warns  against disrupting our fragile economic  recovery:  \u2018\u2018We need a comprehensive  plan now to reduce the debt over the  long  term. But budget  cuts  should  start gradually so they don\u2019t interfere  with the ongoing economic recovery.  Growth is essential to restoring fiscal  strength and balance. We should cut  red tape and unproductive government  spending that hinders job creation and  growth. But at the same time we must  invest in education, infrastructure, and  high-value research and development  to help our economy grow, keep us  globally competitive, and make it easier for businesses to create jobs.\u2019\u2019  The bill before us fails to heed this  sound advice, making shortsighted decisions that will sabotage our short-  term recovery and undermine our long-  term competitiveness. The reckless decisions made in this bill will lead to  lost jobs in my district and throughout  the Nation.  Some of these job losses are obvious.  Deep cuts to COPS and SAFER funding  will ensure that we will lose thousands  of police officers and firefighters protecting our communities nationwide;  but other losses may be less obvious  but just as painful.  For instance, this legislation imposes  deep cuts on the food Food and Drug  Administration.  Every  single  drug,  vaccine, biologic and medical device  must be approved by the FDA before it  can ever be offered to patients. This  means that not only do patients rely  on the FDA but also American pharmaceutical and medical device companies  that need an efficient and effective  FDA to ensure that they can continue  to innovate, grow, and create jobs.  We are lucky to have a medical device industry in this country that is on  the cutting edge of technological advances in medicine. What we should be  doing is modernizing the FDA to make  it more efficient, transparent, predictable, and rigorous; and to do that, we  need to ensure that the FDA has all the  necessary resources to conduct proper  and speedy review of life-saving devices  that not only benefit patients but our  innovative businesses so that many of  them can get to work putting people to  work.  For these private sector firms, cutting FDA  resources means  slowing  down their approval process, driving  some of  them overseas, and  losing  many jobs here in our country as well.  Likewise,  cuts  to  local  funding  included in this bill will harm communities I represent, particularly the deep  cuts to the Community Development  Block Grant program. When  I have  asked leaders in the cities I represent  how we can best help their recovery efforts, the answer has been unhesitating  and unequivocal: CDBG funding.  Last week, the city manager in my  hometown  of Lowell wrote,  saying,  \u2018\u2018This is probably the most valuable  tool that the Federal Government offers cities to address economic development, infrastructure, and community  needs.\u2019\u2019  What is most discouraging about the  attack on CDBG funding is that it does  just what my colleagues say they support: it provides local flexibility, allowing  stakeholders  to decide what  makes  sense  for  their communities,  while ensuring an extremely efficient  use of funds. For example, last year in  the city of Lowell, every $1 in CDBG  funding generated more than $16 in additional funding.  Over the years, Lowell has successfully used CDBG funds to redevelop a  historic building into a much-needed  senior center, turning a blight into a  landmark and prompting the entry of  private businesses nearby. It has used  funds to spur the development of a  mixed-use development that is bringing in millions of dollars in private development and restoring architectural  treasures key to the city\u2019s  identity.  And it has provided seed money to nonprofits like the United Teen Equality  Center, recognized nationally for the  revolutionary work they\u2019re doing every  day to curb gang violence in the city of  Lowell.  All of these actions have improved  the quality of life and created jobs for  Lowell residents, and none might have  been made possible without this modest Federal investment.  So I do not support the underlying  bill, and I encourage its rejection.  Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman,  move to strike the last word.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman  from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.  Ms. MCCOLLUM. I rise today to let  the American people and all MinnesoI  tans know that this continuing resolution is an unprecedented assault on our  public health and environment.  We know that the Federal budget is  in crisis, and we know we must make  tough choices; but those choices must  be prudent, wise, and invest in our future. It should not put the basic health  of Americans at risk. The Republicans\u2019  plan before us proposes to cut $3 billion  from the EPA\u2019s budget, the largest percentage cuts to this critical agency in  30 years.  b1640  The bill also proposes radical policy  language to keep the EPA from carrying out its historic mission\u2014a mission to protect the health of the American people\u2014by  limiting  the EPA\u2019s  ability to enforce the Clean Air Act  and Clean Water Act.  The EPA needs to be allowed to do  its job, and it needs the resources to do  this job. This bill would cause the EPA  to lay off 80 percent of its employees  who are responsible for protecting public health.  State clean water programs are gutted by $2 billion  in the Republican  budget. Our  local  communities  are  struggling with their own budgets, and  these vital  funds allow  for communities to hire engineers, construction  workers, to upgrade water plants and  drinking water projects.  It is the EPA\u2019s investment in clean  water that allows parents to know that  if their child walks up to a drinking  fountain anywhere  in America, they  can have the peace of mind that that  water is safe for their child to drink.  These  irresponsible  cuts  jeopardize  that peace of mind.  The EPA does important work, and  the work  that  the EPA does  saves  lives. I strongly oppose these reckless  Republican cuts and radical deregulation proposals that endanger our communities. Congress needs to make difficult choices. Mr. Chair, I believe that  these are foolhardy choices to shortchange clean air, clean water, and the  health of our families.  On Monday, I received over 1,000 valentines from Minnesotans, and those  valentines were dedicated to the EPA.  My constituents understand the important work that the EPA has done to  protect our water, our land, and their  health over the past 40 years. And it\u2019s  work that they  feel must continue.  This continuing resolution would turn  back all the tremendous progress we  have made in cleaning up our environment, and I firmly reject it and urge  my colleagues to do as well.  Mr. Chair, with that, I yield back the  balance of my time.  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I move to strike  the last word.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman  from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.

            "52": "H988  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE February 16, 2011  The EPA maximum achievable control  technology rule for industrial commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters could impose tens of billions of dollars in capital costs at thousands of facilities across the country.  I, along with a large number of my  colleagues, sent a letter to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson expressing  our concerns with the proposed rule.  It\u2019s my understanding that although  the boiler MACT rule will come out  later this week, upon reconsideration  of the rule, the information gathered  by  the  review  required  under  this  amendment may be useful.  I remain concerned as EPA moves toward a utility MACT rule. Logically, I  bring  this amendment  to  the  floor  today to protect a simple way of thinking. The government should not regulate without sound science to back it  up. Let\u2019s remind EPA to slow down and  allow for reasoning along with regulation.  POINTOFORDER  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I understand the concern of the gentleman  from Texas, and we pledge to work  with him as the EPA comes before our  committee to address this issue, but I  must insist on my point of order.  I make a point of order against the  amendment  because  it  proposes  to  change existing  law and constitutes  legislation in an appropriation bill and,  therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI.  The rule states in pertinent part: an  amendment to a general appropriation  bill shall not be in order if it changes  existing law. This amendment gives affirmative action in effect.  I ask for a ruling by the Chair.  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other  Member wish to be heard on the point  of order? Seeing none, the Chair finds  that this amendment includes language  imparting direction. The amendment,  therefore,  constitutes  legislation  in  violation of clause 2 of rule XXI.  The point of order is sustained and  the amendment is not in order.  Mr. LUJA\u00b4N. Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the last word.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman  from New Mexico is recognized for 5  minutes.  Mr. LUJA\u00b4N. I rise today in opposition to the drastic cuts in this continuing resolution and the amendments  that make further cuts that threaten  to weaken our economy and destroy  jobs.  It is critical that while we face growing budget constraints we do not shortchange  investments that will create  jobs or provide vital services that New  Mexicans rely on.  Unfortunately, many of the cuts proposed in this bill and in a number of  amendments would negatively impact  our communities in New Mexico. For  example, in the wake of the natural gas  outages that left thousands of homes  across the State without heat, this bill  cuts the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps working  families, senior citizens, and disabled  individuals heat their homes.  At a time when New Mexico needs  critical  investments  in education so  that we can prepare our children to be  the next generation of  leaders,  the  House Republican plan makes drastic  cuts to education at all levels. Beginning with early education, Republicans  cut the Head Start program, which  helps build a strong foundation for New  Mexico\u2019s children. The bill also cuts  programs that help poor school districts. With more than one-third of  New Mexico\u2019s students failing to graduate  from high school, we must do  more, not less, to ensure our children  succeed. In addition, the Republican  bill cuts Pell Grants that our young  adults rely on to help make college  more affordable.  Arbitrary cuts to New Mexico\u2019s national labs that are contained in this  bill will hinder their ability to promote  U.S. competitiveness and job creation.  We\u2019re ending our ability to win the  race before we can even begin. Instead  of making these cuts, we need to outpace the competition. We need to out-  educate and out-innovate the rest of  the world in order to grow our economy and put people back to work right  here in New Mexico.  And  as we  debate  the  proposed  amendments in this section of the bill,  I am extremely concerned with amendments that will be proposed today that  make cuts to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  In New Mexico, we  take pride in our beautiful landscapes  and the protection of our water. The  LWCF has helped to protect dozens of  New Mexico  icons,  including Tent  Rocks  National Monument,  Valles  Caldera National Preserve, Rio Grande  River Gorge, Santa Fe National Forest,  and Petroglyphs National Monument,  just to name a few.  These attacks on the Land and Water  Conservation Fund would eliminate a  bipartisan program that has existed for  45 years by preventing revenues deposited in the LWCF account from being  used  for  their  authorized  purposes,  such as protecting public  lands and  promoting recreation.  The Land and Water Conservation  Fund was established by Congress in  1964 as a bipartisan conservation offset  for offshore oil and gas drilling. Under  current law, Outer Continental Shelf  oil and gas leases and royalty receipts  are deposited in a dedicated LWCF account in the Treasury. However, only a  fraction of the annual receipts deposited  in the LWCF have been appropriated, despite a surplus of over $17  billion.  In New Mexico, outdoor recreation is  an integral part of the economy, and I  know when I visit with many of our  colleagues here in the Congress, Democrats  and Republicans,  everyone  is  eager to get out to New Mexico. The  Outdoor Industry Association reports  that recreation contributes about $730  billion annually to the U.S. economy,  supports nearly 6.5 million jobs across  the country, and generates $88 billion  in annual State and national tax revenues.  A recent study by The Trust for Public Land found that every $1 invested in  the LWCF  returns  $4  in  economic  value. Protecting the Land and Water  Conservation Fund will expand opportunities for all Americans to have access to parks and natural areas for outdoor recreation and for hunting.  Protecting the Land and Water Conservation Fund has  immediate  relevance to our efforts to create jobs in  this country, and it is critically important that we ensure funding for this  important Federal  program  is  protected, while also working together to  find a permanent solution to LWCF  funding shortfalls over the long term.  I urge my colleagues to oppose these  amendments and vote  \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 on this  shortsighted  spending bill  that will  hurt families and put more people out  of work. While Republicans say, So be  it, to chopping American jobs, the people of New Mexico deserve better.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will  read.  The Clerk read as follows:  SEC.  1738.

They elected a set of  leaders who understand job creation.  But the EPA has not gotten the message. This Congress has refused to pass  cap-and-trade and yet EPA continues  down the road to try to implement cap-  and-trade  through  regulations when  there is no statutory authority to do  so, and it\u2019s beyond its constitutional  powers.

            "68": "H1004  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE February 16, 2011  of this House. But I proposed it in a  time when we face a national crisis  that goes to our very existence for generations to come, a nation that won\u2019t  be here for our children and our grandchildren.  And when  I  look at  the Presidio  Trust fund and I look at the park\u2014and  it\u2019s a great park. I concede that point.  But the plan for the park was to be  self-sufficient. And upon researching,  going through page by page of this  budget and doing the hard work, my  staff and I have uncovered that this  park is at the point where it can be  self-sufficient on its own.  They receive grants of $80,000 from  the  Cowell  Foundation  for  three  projects. They have a $15 million gift  from the private sector from Evelyn  and Walter Haas, Jr. LucasArts video  games and Industrial Light & Magic  are leasing portions of the park, and  it\u2019s a private revenue stream. This is a  success story. And at this point it\u2019s  time for us to put all our cards on the  table and say, Now that you are standing on your own two feet, when we face  this fiscal crisis, this government now  has to make a responsible decision.  And to me, that responsible decision is  to allow the park to stand on its own  two feet\u2014it has shown plenty of ability  to do that\u2014and save the children and  grandchildren so that we can have a  nation that they can be proud of and  can have a nation that they can live in,  because that\u2019s the point that we are in  our Nation\u2019s history.  So I stand today and ask your support for this amendment. I think it is  the responsible action to do. And I applaud this process, because this process  is being conducted  in the open and  through a vigorous debate, and that\u2019s  what the American people have called  upon us to do. No line of our spending  shall be left under stones. We shall uncover each stone.  I urge all my fellow Members to support this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. MORAN. Madam Chair, I move to  strike the last word.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman  from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. MORAN. I rise in strong opposition to this amendment that would  eliminate  funding  for  the Presidio  Trust.  The Presidio was in continuous use  as a military post from 1776 until 1994.  An Army  installation, the post was  closed in 1994 as part of the BRAC process and transferred to the National  Park Service. In 1996, Congress established the Presidio Trust to govern this  unique national park site and to ensure  its preservation by making it financially self-sustaining. And that\u2019s exactly what has happened.  Over the past 12 years, appropriations as a percentage of the overall  trust budget have been reduced from  over 95 percent Federal funding in fiscal year 1998 to less than 20 percent in  fiscal year 2010. The current ratio of  private investment in the Presidio to  Federal  appropriations  is  already  greater  than  4:1.  Appropriations,  though, are authorized through fiscal  year 2012. That was the deal. After 2012,  the trust itself, by itself, alone, is responsible for long-term operations and  maintenance of the Presidio.  Since it took over management of  the Presidio in 1998, the trust has rehabilitated and leased 97 percent of the  Presidio\u2019s housing units and rehabilitated 75 percent of the Presidio\u2019s 433  very historic buildings. I\u2019ve been there.  I\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s phenomenal what the  trust has accomplished.  Eliminating funds just 1 year short of  its goal violates the spirit of the 1996  law, and it undermines the trust\u2019s ability  to achieve  self-sufficiency. This  would result in higher future obligations,  as  the  Federal Government  might have to assume  full responsibility to maintain the historic properties.  It also sends a terrible signal to communities across the country that may  also  have  innovative  solutions  in  partnering with the Federal Government. They  are  time-controlled;  in  other words, it\u2019s not forever. But they  say  for a certain period of time,  if  you\u2019ll partner with us, we\u2019ll take this  responsibility off your hands.  The $23 million appropriated for the  trust in fiscal year 2010 has created 860  jobs. Federal appropriations  in  this  current fiscal year will help expedite  rehabilitation of historic buildings and  take advantage of favorable construction costs that exist today.  At a recent oversight hearing, the  members of our Appropriations subcommittee  received  assurances  that  the trust will accomplish its financial  stewardship and public use goals. That  was the deal. They said, We\u2019ll meet our  part of the deal, assuming that the  Federal Government will meet its obligation.  As one of the Nation\u2019s oldest and  most  important military posts,  the  trust has had some unique extraordinary challenges since the Defense Department closed out  its  installation,  but the trust is well on its way toward  meeting  its  legislative objectives.  It  should not  be undermined  by  this  amendment.  This has worked well. It\u2019s an example  for the rest of the country. Let it serve  as an example. One more year to go,  and then it will be off our books. The  trust will take over responsibility, and  we will point out that this is the way  to do it, in partnership, where we will  not be perpetually responsible but, in  fact, the private sector will come in,  let the market work and have a national gem, really, a national asset for  everyone to visit and appreciate and  learn from.  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time and strongly urge opposition to this amendment.  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I move  to strike the last word.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman  from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chairman, I  rise in concurrence with the comments  of my ranking member from Virginia.  Funding for the Presidio in this CR is  $8.2 million below the FY10 enacted  level, and $7 million below the fiscal  year 2008 level.  When the government closed down  the Presidio Army base in 1994, it was  transferred to the National Park Service as part of the Golden Gate National  Recreation Area. It could have been  turned over to the National Park Service and run as a historic park, but that  would have cost tens of millions of dollars per year to the taxpayers. Instead,  Congress devised a unique management  and funding model by creating the Presidio Trust to preserve the Presidio and  help  it become  financially self-sufficient. The trust manages 80 percent of  the Presidio lands, including most of  the buildings and infrastructure. The  Park Service manages the remaining 20  percent, including the coastal areas of  the Presidio. The Presidio Trust receives Federal appropriations that are  diminishing each year and, as was mentioned, will cease at the end of FY12,  when it becomes self-sufficient.  This truly is a model of how we can  do these things where they will become  self-sufficient and off the roll of the  taxpayer. But our part of this is we  have to keep our end of the deal. And  so through FY12 we need to make sure  that we keep our word on what was  agreed on in 1996 and let this Presidio  Trust take over and become self-sufficient at the end of the next fiscal year.

            "76": "H1012  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE February 16, 2011  direct loss, mind you, of 800,000 private  and public sector jobs. Instead of doing  everything we can do to halt the loss of  jobs and put people back to work, this  bill takes the wrong approach, putting  our economy and our country back on  the path to recession.  For every job opening in this country, we have 4.7 unemployed people  who are looking for work. Why would  we want to add to their numbers? \u2018\u2018So  be it\u2019\u2019 cannot and should not be our response to this economic crisis, not with  a 9 percent unemployment rate and  over  15  percent  in  communities  of  color, and record layoffs and furloughs  at the State level, and especially not  when Republicans have the temerity to  demand tax breaks for millionaires and  billionaires paid for through borrowed  money. This is just wrong, and it\u2019s immoral.  As a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health  and Human Services, and Education, I  am in strong opposition to these cruel  cuts. Budgets are moral documents,  and they are a reflection of who we are  and what we value. This spending bill  makes  it  clear  that  the poor,  the  young, women, the elderly, teachers,  firefighters, cops, and the communities  that they protect and serve are not valued. Make no mistake, this bill will  harm the most vulnerable among us,  and it represents a wrongheaded approach to reducing the deficit or expanding job growth in our country.  Madam Chair, I am especially concerned about the proposed cuts to education and training programs. Among  the range of cuts include Workforce Investment Act programs, which  last  year helped over 8.4 million job seekers  find  jobs. They got additional education and job training support. This is  being cut.  All told, when counting rescissions of  prior funding, elimination of the requested FY11  funding,  and  the  advanced funding needed to run these employment and training programs, they  will experience nearly a $5 billion cut.  Republican cuts  in  job training will  only prolong the recession, keep unemployment high, and keep more Americans collecting unemployment instead  of training and getting ready for our  21st century job opportunities.  How can we justify cutting job training programs in the middle of an economic crisis? How will my Republican  colleagues respond to the unemployed  in  their communities who come  to  them and ask them for help? Will they  just say \u2018\u2018so be it\u2019\u2019?  Pell Grants. Pell Grants provide vital  funds for students who wish to attend  2- and 4-year colleges but who need  help to pay their expenses. In my district alone, there are 16 institutions  that provide Pell Grants to over 18,000  recipients. This proposal would  cut  Pell Grants by $845, making college  less affordable and accessible for low-  and moderate-income students. More  than 8 million students benefit from  Pell Grants, and many would be hurt  by this cut, especially as schools are  raising tuition fees to meet rising costs  and to deal with tighter budgets.  The bill also entirely eliminates Federal  funding  for Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, which  colleges and universities use to assist  undergraduates who have the greatest  financial need. That program assisted  1.3 million college students last year.  Head Start, under this proposal, is  cut by nearly $1.1 billion. This will effectively knock out 200,000 children,  mind you,  in Republican and Democratic districts from participating in  this critical early education program.  This helps provide health, nutrition,  and supportive services to prepare our  children for school.  The Job Corps program, this program  is cut by $891 million, which will result  in 21,384 jobs lost in communities in  every State, the majority of which are  in the private sector. There will be $1.7  billion lost in economic activity as a  result of this. And 36,000 at-risk young  people will be turned away from Job  Corps, costing the government and the  economy as much as $17 billion over  the course of their lifetimes. Additionally, the cuts will guarantee the closure, mind you, of 75 Job Corps centers  across the Nation in your districts and  in our districts. Slashing one of the  most effective, accountable, and market-driven  solutions  for millions of  youth who  leave our schools unprepared is really the wrong move at the  wrong time.  The majority has stated that they  want to cut the deficit, but, in effect,  they are cutting the social safety net  lifeline for those who need it the most.  This CR leads us down a path that will  result in hopelessness, joblessness, and  desperation, and it destroys the future  for our young people.  I urge my colleagues to meet the  challenge before us and reverse the potential harm that will be inevitable if  this bill is enacted.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I move  to strike the last word.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman  is recognized for 5 minutes.  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Madam  Chair, let me thank the former chair of  the Health and Human Services Subcommittee and now the ranking member, Ms. DELAURO, and the manager  and the chairman of the subcommittee.  I thought, Madam Chairwoman, that  we lived in a country that was a land of  the free and the brave. We had a sense  of pride in the progress that America  has made, and we have always said we  would never want to go back, whether  it has to do with actual equal rights for  women, whether it is civil rights and  the ability to be empowered to vote.  But I stand on the floor today with a  great deal of disappointment because it  seems as if, with this continuing resolution, that will literally stop in its  tracks the functioning of this government. We are really going back.  I rise to support the Lowey amendment because  I  really can\u2019t believe  that this CR is eliminating $327 million  in family planning. It just baffles the  mind that this critical aspect of health  care is now in jeopardy. It is now being  part of turning the clock back. It is  amazing that we would not acknowledge the fact that lives of women have  been saved, lives of young girls have  been saved because they\u2019ve had access  to family planning.  As much as we have fought to be able  to ensure that around the world where  indigent women who have  lost their  lives through the birthing process now  have access to good medical care\u2014and  yes, family planning\u2014so that they can  have live births, now we come here to  the soil of the United States, and to  take $327 million out of the mouths and  the hands of women and children\u2014yes,  children who can be born healthy. Children who are part of the health care  process that these women are able to  secure through the many clinics that  are around this Nation and in this community.  I am disappointed in the games that  are played with Planned Parenthood  and to be able to demonize them with  false and fraudulent tapings and a lot  of bogus arguments about the fact that  they are not in the business of helping  people.  I am disappointed  in using  those tactics because this is a very serious issue. Mrs. LOWEY\u2019s amendment  addresses the seriousness of it because  she  realizes  that  if we were  to go  through with the elimination of $327  million, there would be many, many  lives that are lost.  We have a Planned Parenthood office  in my community. It is mostly focusing its attention on educating the community about healthy births, about ensuring that teenagers are not alone  when decisions have to be made, decisions that will allow for the healthy  birth or determination that is made by  their  faith  leader with their  family.  They will not be left alone. In fact,  family planning and Planned Parenthood extinguishes, I hope for good, the  back alley procedures and, as well, the  rusty hangers that were used in years  past.  Just a day or two ago, we heard of a  horrible abortion clinic that saw the  lives lost of babies and their mothers  because of the dastardly tactics that  were being used. That is not what we  speak of here today. We speak of the  right of a woman to be able to choose  but also to accept the good health care  of family planning.  b2130  We speak of the rights of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence that really ensure that we all  are created equal, with certain inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The Bill of Rights,  which allows us due process, is what is  being denied in this continuing resolution for, as we speak, if that money is  eliminated,  clinics  around America  will have their doors closed.

AMENDMENTNO. 276OFFEREDBYMRS.  MCMORRISRODGERS  Mrs. MCMORRIS  RODGERS. Mr.  Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will  designate the amendment.

The gentlewoman  from Washington  is recognized  for 5  minutes.  Mrs. MCMORRIS  RODGERS. Mr.  Chairman, my amendment is simple. It  increases funding for the part B program of  IDEA, which provides educational grants to States for children  with disabilities, by $557 million, restoring funding for the program to 2010  levels. The amendment is fully offset  by reducing  funding to the Teacher  Quality State Grant program and the  School  Improvement Grant program,  two programs that have received substantial funding increases since 2009.  Mr. Chairman, 35 years ago Congress  recognized that too many special needs  children were being denied an education and the opportunity to maximize their potential and contribution  to our society, and 35 years ago severely disabled children who were confined to State institutions received no  education. Special needs students did  not attend school. They were kept out  of  classrooms,  receiving  little  education.  b2240  Today, more than 6 million children  receive an effective education because  of IDEA. Special needs children are no  longer confined  to  institutions. The  number of special needs students who  graduate high school with a diploma  has increased. The number of children  who go on to enroll in high school has  more than tripled since IDEA\u2019s enactment. And through IDEA, we have increased our Nation\u2019s expectations of  our children. But more can and must  be done.  The  McMorris  Rodgers/Kline/Sessions/Harper amendment ensures that  Congress keeps its promise. Too often  IDEA is overlooked in our education  debates. For example, Congress has yet  to meet its commitment to cover 40  percent of a student\u2019s cost. Barriers to  reliable  research  prevent  effective  teaching. Low expectations continue to  plague our school systems. The reductions to IDEA in H.R. 1 are just another example of the challenges that  IDEA experiences.  This amendment reaffirms that there  is no greater priority in Congress than  ensuring all children have access to an  appropriate education.  I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman  from Connecticut is recognized for 5  minutes.  Ms. DELAURO. Providing a quality  education  for all students,  including  those with disabilities, should be one of  our highest priorities. So I agree with  the goal of this amendment.  But, in fact, we are considering a Republican  resolution,  this  continuing  resolution this evening, and  it\u2019s the  majority party, to which the gentlewoman belongs, which cuts IDEA. It  cuts special education by $558 million.  So now we have an amendment that attempts to undo the damaging cuts to  IDEA, but only by cutting other critical education programs. The damage  done in this bill cannot be alleviated  by robbing Peter to pay Paul. That\u2019s  what this amendment is about.  Let me just mention to you that\u2014  and our colleague spoke about special  education and what it does. But $558  million is where they come from with  regard to education for special needs  kids. What that means is almost 7,000  special education teachers and aides  and other staff who serve these youngsters would not be there. And it is critical. Teachers and staff are critical to  the education of these youngsters. As a  matter of  fact, the Federal Government mandates that local school districts have to provide this education.  And when it was determined that that  would be the case,  it said that the  States would do 60 percent, the Federal  Government would do 40 percent.  What\u2019s happened now is we\u2019ve been at  about 17 percent in terms of Federal  contribution. With the $558 million cut  we go down to about 15 percent.  I would suggest that if there is such  a great urgent need and a great burning desire to be able to provide education to special needs children, that  we do not cut $558 million.  Now, where does the money come  from? As I mentioned, we\u2019re talking  about  other  critical  education  programs. School improvement grants. I  venture to say that everybody is concerned about those schools that are  failing, that there\u2019s got to be student  achievement  at  these  schools. And  that\u2019s what the current Federal law requires, that there\u2019s demonstrable success in student achievement. The funds  for the school improvement grants are  appropriated  precisely  for  those  schools that fail the test and are seeking to implement a strategy for turning around our Nation\u2019s  lowest-performing  schools.  That\u2019s  where  we  would take money  from  in order to  turn a potentially  failing school, to  turn around so that they can go from  the  lowest-performing  to better-performing schools.  The other place that my colleague  takes funds from is something called  the Teacher Quality Grants, an approximately $3 billion program and a  major piece of No Child Left Behind.  This  provides  funds  to States  and  school districts to develop and support  a high quality teacher force.  Aren\u2019t we all about making sure that  those people who teach our children  are qualified to do that? These funds  are  distributed  by  formula  to  all  States. They are relied upon tremendously to reduce class size, to ensure  that classroom teachers have the proper training and credentials to be effective instructors.  There isn\u2019t a day that goes by that  we aren\u2019t talking about school reform,  and at the center of school reform is to  develop quality teachers. And, in fact,  we want to try to link merit pay to  quality teachers, do everything we can,  but my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle would like to take the money  for school improvement grants, teacher  quality grants.  I suggest to you that what you do, if  you are really truly interested in educating special needs children, that you  VerDate Mar 15 2010  08:29 Feb 17, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00084 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A16FE7.062 H16FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",

I consider this an emergency, and I  would ask that this point of order be  waived in order to provide for the thousands of students, Mr. Chairman, that  are now going to stop school because of  the $1,000, $800 they will lose. I\u2019m asking the gentleman for a waiver so that  this is based on an emergency and the  fact there was no offset available that  would not  impact negatively  other  vital programs to make America equal.  I\u2019d ask for a waiver and I\u2019d ask for this  amendment  to be accepted and  the  point of order to be waived.  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other  Member wish to be heard on the point  of order? The Chair is prepared to rule.  The gentleman from Montana makes  a point of order that the amendment  offered by the gentlewoman from Texas  violates section 3(j)(3) of House Resolution 5.  Section 3(j)(3) establishes a point of  order against an amendment proposing  a net increase in budget authority in  the pending bill.  The  Chair  has  been  persuasively  guided by an estimate from the chair of  the Committee on the Budget that the  amendment proposes a net increase in  budget authority in the bill. Therefore,  the point of order  is sustained. The  amendment is not in order.  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman  from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes.  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to  support  the Chu-Moore-Jackson Lee  amendment for the continuing appropriations act, H.R. 1, because we\u2019re  deeply concerned about the cuts to the  Pell Grant  funding contained  in the  continuing  resolution  which  would  slash funding by $845, a 15 percent cut,  and, of course, this amendment would  preserve the Pell Grant program and  maintain the full award level.  I am, you know, again, just a little  bit perturbed, Mr. Chairman. This cut,  like so many cuts in the resolution,  would disproportionately harm traditionally underserved communities. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, Pell recipients are  more likely to be female, first-generation college students, and less likely to  be white than those who don\u2019t receive  the grants. In other words, Mr. Chairman, they kind of look like me.  Minority  students  also  face  disproportionate  unmet  need, meaning  the amount that they still need to pay  for college even after family contributions,  parties,  raising money  from  their  churches,  grants,  nonprivate  loans still will not meet their needs to  go to college. Women sometimes come  into college with more precarious fialready  They\u2019re  nancial  situations.  parents and mothers.  Now, you know, if this country is  prepared to just slide into irrelevancy  in the global economic community because we don\u2019t educate our workforce,  this would be the loss leading legislation to do that. Cutting the program is  so counterintuitive to our remaining a  first-rate power.  And what is our secret weapon in this  country for staying on top? It\u2019s our diversity, our diversity to be competitive. We\u2019re women. We\u2019re blacks. We\u2019re  Asians. We\u2019re Hispanics. We\u2019re Indians.  We\u2019re Hmong. We bring different talents and abilities to the table, and our  ability to educate these young people  comes with our ability to provide a  Pell Grant which  levels the playing  field for all students.  There\u2019s not a politician in this country that doesn\u2019t make part of their  platform that this country has got to  have a highly educated 21st century  workforce. There\u2019s not a politician,  Democrat, Republican, Independent, or  any other stripe, that doesn\u2019t say and  pronounce that education is the key,  and yet we\u2019re not willing to provide the  lubricant so that key can fit into the  lock, and that is the resources to make  sure our students can go to school.  This Pell Grant is that opportunity.  Don\u2019t deny it to students. Don\u2019t deny  it. Don\u2019t deny it, Mr. Chair.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will  read.

It\u2019s more unfortunate that if we\u2019re going to be subject to  a strict  interpretation of the House  rules, I have a list of provisions already  in this young session where time after  time the majority has chosen to waive  the rules since they were first adopted,  when it served their purpose. If our colleagues are serious about cutting the  deficit, they will not  just allow the  amendment to be debated, but they  will vote upon it and pass it.  Mr. Chairman,  the  public  doesn\u2019t  care whether the deficit is reduced by  closing a  tax  loophole or  reducing  spending. I\u2019ll bet it would rather stop  another giveaway to large oil companies rather than cutting programs that  are important to them.

This has been going on for too many  years\u2014too many decades. As a matter  of fact, you can come into a meeting,  and you will probably get the question\u2014even the distinguished President  pro tempore, the Senator  from New  York, would get the question, though  probably a little nicer than I would get  it, and certainly  the other Senator  from New York, who is now leaving the  Chamber\u2014the question usually comes  as: PAT, what on Earth are you doing  back there, saddling us with paperwork  and regulations that are costly, burdensome, and that we don\u2019t even know  about? All of a sudden, on a Wednesday  morning we wake up and we face this  regulatory  dictate.  It  is  counterproductive, and the cost outweighs the  benefit. What is going on back there?  What are you guys doing?  My response: Well, let\u2019s stop there  for just a minute. I am not a  \u2018\u2018you  guy,\u2019\u2019 I am an \u2018\u2018us guy.\u2019\u2019  Clear back in the days when I was in  the House of Representatives and I had  the privilege of serving in that body,  we were all trying to do something  about  unnecessary  and  burdensome  regulations. So  I have had a  longstanding concern with the regulatory  process, and that is the one issue that  is a tinderbox issue. It is one where you  really get an immediate response, with  people saying: Amen. Somebody needs  to do something about that. And they  were  so pleased with  the President  when he came out with the Executive  order, saying: Hey, I am going to do  something about this.  As of January 3, 2011,  less than 6  months after the Dodd-Frank act was  signed into law, regulators have issued  over 1,000 pages of regulatory proposals  and 360 pages of final rules. Talk about  asking Senators whether  they have  read a bill, I know that nobody in the  Senate has read over the 1,000 pages of  regulatory proposals and 360 pages of  final rules on the regulatory reform  act. And many more pages of regulations\u2014upwards of 5,000\u2014are expected.  Regulations such as those put forth  by  the Department  of Health  and  Human Services, along with the Departments of Labor and Treasury, have  resulted  in  the child-only  insurance  market effectively disappearing in 20  States because of the regulations. The  idea was to provide just the opposite  but in 20 States today, that is not the  case.  The Environmental Protection Agency began implementing its greenhouse  gas regulations on stationary sources  of energy that emit 75,000 or more tons  of CO2 a year, which, on its surface,  aims to only regulate those  largest  emitters, such as powerplants and oil  refineries, but it is only a matter of  time\u2014it is only a matter of time\u2014before  stricter  regulations are handed  down that will impact every corner of  commerce.  Let me just say that the EPA\u2014knowing, of course, that Congress said no to  cap and trade\u2014is trying very hard to  go around the Congress to try to put  forth  these  regulations  into compliance with the law.  Last  year,  the Grain  Inspection,  Packers  and Stockyard Administration\u2014and everything has to have an  acronym in Washington, but the one  for that is called GIPSA\u2014published a  proposed rule that would change longstanding rules governing the production and marketing of livestock. This  is an agriculture thing. This proposed  rule goes far beyond what was intended  in the last farm bill. In fact, a number  of items in the proposed rule were defeated here on the Senate floor, and yet  they were put in the proposed rule.  A number of private economic studies show the  loss of gross domestic  product is in excess of $1 billion\u2014much  more  costly  than  the  $100 million  threshold  required  for an  economic  analysis  to  be  completed. Unfortunately, an economic analysis is yet to  be completed.  So I was encouraged, Madam President. I was a happy camper there for a  little bit by President Obama\u2019s commitment to a new regulatory strategy.  But the devil is in the details, and with  staff help, after reviewing the Executive order, I must say I was left with  some larger concerns. I was upset.  The Executive order states:  In applying these principles, each agency is  directed to use the best available techniques  to quantify anticipated present and future  benefits and costs as accurately as possible.  Wonderful. We will have a cost-benefit yardstick applied to all of the regulations pouring out of all the agencies  in  Washington.  The  distinguished  Speaker of the House said the other  day that we had 200,000 more Federal  employees in Washington than we did 2  years ago. I can assure you they are  not twiddling their thumbs. They are  issuing regulations, and they tend to  be agenda-oriented, not really getting  down to sound science or determining  the unanticipated effects of their regulations.  Picking up again on what the President said:  Where appropriate and permitted by law,  each agency may consider and discuss qualitatively values that are difficult or impossible to quantify, including equity, human  dignity, fairness, and distributive impacts.  The partridge in the pear tree was  left out.  Let me read this again.  Where appropriate and permitted by law,  each agency\u2014  As they go through the regulations  to  determine  which  are  counterproductive to this economy, costing  billions in regard to manufacturing and  businesses and harming our economy  where it should not be harmed, they  say, OK, but, but, but\u2014  Where appropriate and permitted by law,  each agency may consider\u2014  values that are difficult or  quantify\u2014  How are you going to do that? How  are you going to quantify values that  are difficult or impossible\u2014  including equity\u2014  Everybody is for that\u2014  human dignity\u2014  I don\u2019t know anyone who is against  that\u2014  fairness, and distributive impacts.  Now, try to figure that out if you are  working in a Federal agency and you  are trying to issue a regulation. If that  isn\u2019t a loophole large enough to drive a  truck through, I don\u2019t know what is.  As the Wall Street Journal captured  so  eloquently  in  their  response  to  President Obama\u2019s  editorial,  \u2018\u2018These  amorphous concepts are not measurable at all.\u2019\u2019 You can\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t  measure them.  On the surface, I think this language  has the potential to be a very large  loophole. This, coupled with an exception for independent agencies such as  the FDIC, the SEC, or the EPA, has the  potential to result in no changes at all.  So we issue an Executive order saying:  Let\u2019s take a tough look at the regulations  that are  so  terribly  counterproductive, and we may end up with  nothing, more especially without the  independent agencies. Note I said the  FDIC. Note I said the SEC. Read Dodd-  Frank, read  financial regulatory reform. Read the reach into the small  community banks and what they are  going to have to put up with and hire  a bunch of bad news bears\u2014employees\u2014to figure out and tell the rest of  the employees how on Earth they are  going to comply with these new regulations.  And my favorite, the EPA, which had  the temerity and the unmitigated gall,  after this loophole came out, to say:  Well, none of our  regulations  even  apply. Our regulations are just fine. I  got news for the EPA. The chairwoman  of the Agriculture Committee, DEBORAHSTABENOW, and I have agreed to  hold a hearing on this to determine  just exactly where we are, and where  we are is not good.  My legislation would close the loophole in President Obama\u2019s Executive  order and would close other existing  loopholes, including those that the administration has been using to bypass  valuable stakeholder input on regulations. Again,  there  is  that word\u2014  \u2018\u2018stakeholder.\u2019\u2019 That is a Senate word.  Those are the people who are getting  smacked right up alongside the face in  regard to the regulations they do not  even know adhere to their business or  what they are about.  The President has also agreed\u2014and  here is the key word or phrase:  Sometimes, those rules have gotten out of  balance, placing unreasonable burdens on  businesses\u2014burdens that have stifled innovation and have had a chilling effect on growth  and jobs.  And this is the part where we ought  to really take a look at it\u2014  The President went on to say, \u2018\u2018At  other times, we have failed to meet our  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:46 Feb 16, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G16FE6.007 S16FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",

They want 10 million more dollars to  strengthen  oversight  on  tax-exempt  hospitals. These are tax-exempt hospitals. Why are  the American  taxpayers being asked to pay another $10  million to hire 84 full-time equivalents  to deal with tax-exempt hospitals? Because, according to the law that was  crammed  down  the  throats  of  the  American people, the IRS is now required to review at least every 3 years  the benefit activities of  tax-exempt  hospital organizations, which number  about 5,100 in this country. They actually say in the budget request by the  IRS, as part of the President\u2019s budget  that was submitted on Monday:  These are new requirements for tax-exempt  hospitals which include a majority of hospitals in the United States.  We are going to  increase taxpayer  dollars going  for more IRS auditors  and make it harder and more burdensome on the tax-exempt hospitals in  terms of paperwork and what they need  to do.  It goes on and on. That is why the  American people are fed up with what  is happening in Washington.  Let\u2019s  talk a  little bit about  the  CLASS Act because there is a whole  component of the budget wanting 30  staff members added to the health department office overseeing implementation of what  is called the CLASS  Act. That stands for community living  assistance services and supports.  The President\u2019s own debt commission\u2014remember,  the  President  appointed this commission about a year  ago to say: Let\u2019s look into the debt.  People thought that was a bold move, a  bipartisan move, a lot of people coming  together to take a look at this debt.  For a year, the President said: We have  a debt commission looking into this, so  he did not deal with the debt. Now that  the debt commission came out with its  report in December, the President has  mostly ignored it. Yet the debt commission\u2014it was bipartisan, chaired by  Erskine Bowles, a former Chief of Staff  of the White House for Bill Clinton,  and Al Simpson, a former Senator from  my State of Wyoming\u2014came out, took  a look at the health care law, and specifically honed in on this CLASS Act.  One of the Members of this Senate, a  colleague on the opposite side of the  aisle, someone who voted for the health  care law, called it a Ponzi scheme that  Bernie Madoff would be proud of.  The President\u2019s budget commission,  the  bipartisan  budget  commission,  looked at it, and they have significant  concerns about the sustainability of  the program and called for the program  to either be repealed or reformed because it is not sustainable. They have  raised concerns. People on both sides of  the aisle have raised concerns. Yet the  Secretary of Health and Human Services has, in her budget, money for 30  additional staff members added to the  health department offices. Why? To go  over the details of this act that people  say ought to be repealed because, as it  says, the details of the CLASS Act\u2014  they want to spend $93.5 million informing and educating people about  the CLASS Act. I can tell them right  now it is unsustainable, it is irresponsible, and it is something that should  be repealed. Yet the Department of  Health and Human Services wants to  spend over  $93 million of  taxpayer  money to inform and educate the public about this component of the health  care law that people on both sides of  the aisle think needs to go away.  Finally, as someone who believes this  health care law is bad for patients, bad  for providers\u2014the nurses and doctors  who take care of those patients\u2014and  bad for the taxpayers\u2014what we saw in  the President\u2019s budget that came out  Monday, coming out for next year, is it  is asking for over 1,000 new IRS agents  to go ahead and implement the various  components and responsibilities that  have been put on their heads by this  health care law. This is only the beginning. The entire health care law does  not really come fully into play until  2014. That is when Americans are going  to have more IRS agents, more money  being spent looking into their own personal lives, looking into what kind of  insurance they have.  Is it acceptable to the government?  Is  it government approved? That  is  why Senator GRAHAMand I have introduced  legislation  called  the  State  Health Care Choice Act, to let States  decide. Let States decide if Washington  ought to be telling the people in their  States that they must buy, that every  individual must buy government-approved insurance. Let the States make  that decision. Let the States opt out if  they would like. Let the States decide  if all the businesses  in their States  must provide government-approved insurance  to  their workers. Let  the  States decide as to Medicaid, a program for low-income Americans which  is  being  expanded  significantly  by  cramming 16 million more Americans  into Medicaid. Governors all across the  country in a bipartisan way are saying:  Our States cannot afford this.  A New York Times story shows Jerry  Brown  from California  and Andrew  Cuomo  from New York complaining  about the mandates Medicaid is putting on their States, the additional  burdens in terms of taxes and the mandates and what it is going to do to the  people of the State who are trying to  educate their kids and the cost and the  pressure on education dollars because  they are getting shifted to Medicaid,  the cost of dollars shifted away from  public safety, from firefighters, police  officers, other public safety officers. As  to this health care law, I think people  at the State level ought to decide that,  no, we don\u2019t want this to apply to us.  That is why I come today, again as a  physician who practiced medicine  in  Wyoming for a quarter of a century,  took care of thousands and thousands  of patients and families, trying to help  people get better, all in a way that now  I think is being taken in the wrong direction by this health care law, and  why I think we want to continue to  look for ways to make sure people get  the care they want from the doctors  they need at a price they can afford.  The health care law that was passed by  this body fails in all of those respects,  and now we see, with the President\u2019s  budget, a request for money for another thousand IRS agents, not to help  people get better, not to help people  get the care they need from a doctor  they want at a cost they can afford\u2014  no, not at all\u2014but to audit the health  care of the American people.  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  UDALLof New Mexico). The clerk will  call the roll.  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call  be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without  objection, it is so ordered.  EFFECTSOFTHERECESSION  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise  to briefly do three things. No. 1, there  are a lot of politicians and pundits and  economists who are proclaiming all  over the country that the recession is  over. They have some economic models  by which they determine that the recession is over. I suggest those pundits  and economists and politicians take a  look at the booklet we recently produced in my office. It is called \u2018\u2018Struggling Through the Recession\u2014Letters  from Vermont.\u2019\u2019  We have also received letters from  other States, people in other States as  well. We sent out a request for people  to tell us, as we enter the third year of  this recession, what  is happening  in  their  lives. We got,  from my small  State, over 400 responses. That is a lot  from a small State. We probably received an equal number from around  the rest of the country.  The problem I had with these letters,  some of them are so painful to read  that it is hard to read more than a few  at a time because you get sick to your  stomach hearing what good and decent  and  hard-working  people  are  going  through.  I wish to take a few moments to read  a handful of the letters I am receiving  from Vermont, in answer to the question: Is the recession over?  This comes from a young lady from  central Vermont. She says:  I have been fortunate to hold onto my job  throughout the past 3 years, especially since  I have about $42,000 remaining on my school  loans.  One of the recurring themes we hear  from all over Vermont\u2014and I suspect  it is true in New Mexico and all over  the country\u2014is a lot of young people  are graduating with a heck of a lot of  debt. The jobs they are getting are not  sufficient,  in terms of pay, to help  them pay off that debt.

I urge my colleagues to support the Snowe-Collins-  Coburn-Brown  amendment  to  strike  this language.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  clerk will call the roll.  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent  that the order for the quorum call be  rescinded.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  WHITEHOUSE). Without objection, it is  so ordered.  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have  been working through this bill. I congratulate our manager, Senator ROCKEFELLER, who is one of the most experienced people in the Senate and is a  good manager. He has worked well with  Senator HUTCHISON, comanager of the  bill.  We  have  made  significant  progress. We have a few amendments  on which we are trying to work a way  to the end of this. I hope we can work  out an agreement to complete this legislation maybe as early as tomorrow  morning sometime.  If we can\u2019t, the  first cloture vote is tomorrow, and we  will see what happens after that.  Everyone  should understand.  It  is  Wednesday. Tomorrow is Thursday. I  know a  lot of people have arrangements because we have a home work  period the following week. We want to  go home, if at all possible, late tomorrow night or early Friday morning, but  we can\u2019t do that if there is work left to  be done on this bill. I hope we can work  something out so we can finish tomorrow. It would certainly be doable.  We know what we have left. Work on  the different issues has been extremely  difficult and time-consuming, but we  have settled most everything on the  Senate floor, as we are supposed to do.  There will be no more rollcall votes  tonight. We hope we can move forward  to complete work on this most important  piece  of  legislation  tomorrow.  This  legislation  is extremely  important for our country.  Let\u2019s keep in mind, this deals with  people. Almost 300,000 jobs will be created or saved with this legislation. I repeat what I have said on the Senate  floor once before. McCarran Airport in  Las Vegas is the sixth busiest airport  in the country. The manager of that  airport, Randy Walker, when asked  about this bill last week, said: If it  passes, we will finally be able to stop  using World War II technology to land  and have airplanes take off.  It is not just McCarran in Las Vegas.  At every airport in the country it is  the same thing, World War II technology. We will be able to have a passengers\u2019 bill of rights. It is a very fine  piece of legislation that has been years  in the making. We are too close to the  end of this to walk away. We have to  finish this bill. It means jobs, real jobs,  not make believe jobs.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The  clerk will call the roll.  The  legislative clerk proceeded  call the roll.  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent  the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  MANCHIN). Without objection, it is so  ordered.  to  f  MORNING BUSINESS  Mr. REID.

DuBois,  Henry  Moscowitz, Mary White Ovington, Oswald  Garrison  Villard,  and William  English  Walling;  Whereas the NAACP is the oldest and largest civil rights organization in the United  States;  Whereas  the  NAACP  National  Headquarters is located in Baltimore, Maryland;  Whereas the mission of the NAACP is to  ensure the political, educational, social, and  economic equality of rights of all people and  to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination;  Whereas  the NAACP  is  committed  achieving its goals through nonviolence;  Whereas the NAACP advances its mission  through reliance on the press, the petition,  the ballot, and the courts;  Whereas the NAACP has been persistent in  the use of legal and moral persuasion, even  in the face of overt and violent racial hostility;  Whereas  the NAACP has used political  pressure, marches, demonstrations, and effective lobbying to serve as the voice, as well  as the shield, for minorities in the United  States;  Whereas after years of fighting segregation  in public schools, the NAACP, under the  leadership of Special Counsel Thurgood Marshall, won one of its greatest legal victories  in the decision issued by the Supreme Court  in Brown v.

Mr. Chairman,  it  is my  strong belief  that  the pre-eminent  reason a  majority of Northern Michigan\u2019s citizens selected me to be their representative in Washington was to do everything possible to rein in  out-of-control Federal spending. My focus has  been to support such efforts while working to  ensure that policies coming out of the Nation\u2019s  Capital\u2014tax, monetary, and regulatory\u2014serve  to encourage private enterprise so Northern  Michigan has the chance to experience economic growth.  My first 44 days in office have taught me a  great deal about the budget process and the  \u2018\u2018spending ways of Washington.\u2019\u2019 Each day we  have been in session I have typically had 5\u2013  10 meetings with organizations, companies  and Washington reps all seeking to keep their  programs free of any spending cuts. No one in  Washington has asked me to spend less. In  fact,  it seems  in every Washington meeting  while there occasionally is a recognition of the  doom America  faces  if  the current spending  continues, each meeting usually closes with  an expected  refrain  \u2018\u2018. . . yes we need  to  spend less but not our program.\u2019\u2019  By contrast, during my first visit home, just  about everyone in the First District asked me  to make sure the Federal Government spends  less. In Northern Michigan there seems to be  a strong consensus that Federal budget red  ink can no longer continue at record pace.  Here are my guiding \u2018\u2018spend less\u2019\u2019 principles  in this 112th Congress:  Shared Responsibility: Before there is any  comprehensive entitlement reform effort, every  Federal department should be prepared to live  with less money in 2012 than it received in  2011.  Sunlight and Transparency: All spending decisions should be made in a fully transparent  legislative process. No backdoor earmarks, no  special interest amendments. If a program has  merit  its supporters should defend  the program in public floor debate.  Tighten the Revenue Spigot: Simply sending  more money  to Washington  is not going  to  solve  the problem of unchecked spending;  every year the U.S. Treasury receives more  money; every year  the Federal Government  spends more than it takes in. Consequently,  increasing taxes is not the answer.  If not now, when? I have publicly promised  to  limit my career  in Congress  to  just  three  terms. America\u2019s future is more important than  any one of us in Congress, certainly more important  than any political  job.  I\u2019d  rather do  what I think is right than simply keep this position. I trust the voters.  In my view,  the debt  is not a Republican  issue or a Democrat issue. It is an American  issue.  The  failure of previous Congresses  to act  means America now faces a $14 trillion debt.  For every dollar Congress allocates the U.S.  Treasury has to borrow up to $.40 to pay for  it. That means indebting ourselves to countries  like China and mortgaging our children\u2019s  future.  Let me be clear, this will not be easy. To  stem the tide, many tough decisions will need  to be made. Northern Michigan\u2014like the entire  country\u2014has a backlog of worthy projects and  its people have benefited from admirable public programs. The reductions in H.R. 1 affect  every community in the nation. These are hard  decisions for Congress to make, and not everyone will be happy with everything that has  been proposed. This is understandable, but I  believe  these  reductions are necessary  to  show that Congress is serious about returning  our country to a sustainable financial path.  The Continuing Resolution to be considered  on the House Floor this week is just the first  step. Fortunately, the President\u2019s budget proposal  is merely a suggestion  that Congress  can  improve upon.  In my view, Congress  needs to offer a more fiscally sound budget for  FY 2012.  Additionally, it is my view that Congress will  need to consider reforming entitlements programs. Social Security and Medicare are important programs  that millions of Americans  depend on. Without reform, both of these programs face bankruptcy. In my opinion, Congress needs to consider solutions to avoid this  crisis that ensures benefits under Social Security and Medicare are not reduced for those  Americans currently receiving benefits.  And  I  think most of my colleagues agree  this is not a time to play politics. The inflamed  rhetoric and scare attacks on cutting grandma\u2019s benefits have no place here. This week\u2019s  vote will not take away benefits for anyone receiving benefits. Instead, Congress will have  completed the first step and as the Constitution dictates, the Senate and the President will  have their say.  f  TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM \u2018\u2018BILLY\u2019\u2019  LYON  HON. JO BONNER  OFALABAMA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 16, 2011  Mr. BONNER. Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to pay  tribute  to a  longstanding business  leader  in  South Alabama, Mr. William \u2018\u2018Billy\u2019\u2019 Lyon, who  recently passed away at the age of 80.  A native of Mobile, Mr. Lyon graduated from  Murphy High School in 1944 and attended the  Citadel  in Charleston, South Carolina before  joining the Navy in 1945, where he served on  the USS Chicago. Following  the end of  the  war, he attended Auburn University and  the  University of North Carolina.  A natural entrepreneur, Mr. Billy became a  homebuilder with a lifelong passion for commercial and  residential  real estate development in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida and Georgia.  He developed scores of  local  residential  subdivisions, including Brookwood, Blacksher  Downs, Tuthill Lane Estates and Carriage  Hills, and sold lots to nearly every builder in  Mobile. He also partnered and developed numerous commercial shopping centers, including Mobile\u2019s Bel Air Mall, which opened  in  1966.  He was one of the founding board members  of Commercial Guaranty Bank  in Mobile,  which later became SouthTrust Bank, and also  served on the Boards of Bel Air Corporation,  Mobile Gas Company, First Southern Federal,  Altus Bank, the Drug Education Council, and  the Alabama School of Math and Science.  Mr. Billy was the longest active member of  the Home Builders Association of Mobile and  received the E. L. Jones award in 2002. He  witnessed and played a vital role in Mobile for  many  years,  helping  countless  individuals,  bankers, builders, realtors, friends and associates along the way.  On behalf of the people of South Alabama,  I extend my condolences to his wife, Patricia;  their  two  sons, BJ and  Jimmy;  their  four  daughters, Tricia, Nancy, Victoria and Ashley;  nineteen grandchildren and their entire family.  You are all in our thoughts and prayers.  f  HONORING DR. MICHAEL COLLINS  HON. MIKE QUIGLEY  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 16, 2011  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor the distinguished career of Dr. Michael  Collins. For more than 25 years, he has exhibited a drive and work ethic on and off the ice  that serves as  inspiration  to his colleagues  and friends.  Dr. Collins, a Chicago native, attended the  University of Notre Dame. In South Bend he  played varsity hockey and shoveled furnaces  to pay the bills, but still graduated in three and  a half years. Upon graduation, Michael spent  several years driving a cab, and working construction before entering medicine. After  returning to college for another two years to take  pre-med courses, he attended the Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine followed by  five years at the Mayo Clinic. He is now a full-  time, board-certified orthopedic surgeon.  In addition to his medical practice, he has  written professionally for more than 30 years.  His  first book, Hot Lights, Cold Steel, continues to be a best-seller in the medical memoir field. Since its publication, Michael has lectured extensively on  topics relating  to medicine and writing.  Dr. Collins\u2019 hard work and accomplishments  have earned him national attention, and  in  2010  he  received  the  American Hockey  Coaches Association Lou Lamoriello Award.  The Lamoriello Award  recognizes a  former  college hockey player or coach who goes on  to a distinguished career in or out of hockey.  Michael and his wife, Patti, have raised 12  children and today he still plays hockey twice  a week. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to  join me in recognizing Dr. Michael Collins and  his  life of achievement. His career has  inspired many and continues to impress.  f  RECOGNIZING TIFFANY MCKINNIE  AS THE 2011 WASHINGTON COUNTY EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT PERSON OF THE YEAR  HON.

BENNIE G. THOMPSON  OFMISSISSIPPI  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 16, 2011  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Oscar Price Jr.  Mr. Price who was born in Robinsonville, MS  on July 24, 1953 to the late Oscar, Sr. and  Dora. Encouraged by his parents, Oscar Jr.,  learned the value of education at an early age.  Oscar attended  school at Christian Spring  Church where he was taught by the late Edna  Pullam Carpenter. Soon after, Oscar attended  school at Shallow Baptist Church and  later  transferred to Rosa Fort Elementary during the  early 60s. Price  furthered his education, attended grade school, middle school, and completed his coursework in 1972. He worked on  farms and returned to school to graduate from  Rosa Fort High School, Class of 73. Oscar  completed various technical courses and educational training to advance in a competitive  job market.  Oscar, at an early age, confessed Christ at  Good Hope #1 Baptist Church under the leadership of Reverend R. Douglas. Price participated in various church activities that taught  good morals, sound values, and respect  for  others. Price earned the role of becoming a  junior deacon at his church. He served his  church family and community through volunteering and participating in events. Later, Price  became a Deacon at Good Hope where he  continues to worship. In addition, to this spiritualistic  accomplishment,  Price  has  now  served as the Chairman of the Deacon Board  for over twenty years.  Oscar\u2019s employment career began on local  farms.

The cost of an arms race in the Mideast and an arms race in the world  with new nuclear weapons far surpasses  anything we can imagine\u2014as are the  revenues we can get from oil.  So I ask my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill, the SECURE Act,  so we can secure our own energy future, so we can lower gas prices, so we  can create thousands of jobs right here  at home: from drilling on these rigs,  from developing the pipe, from building  the rigs, from so many other supply  chains of what we have in this Nation  to do this, and above all, so we keep  our domestic oil at home rather than  pay for our own dollars to go to other  nations.  We can drill for our oil and our own  jobs, and we can boost our own economy; or we can continue to be dependent on unstable nations, rising prices  and, sadly, paying for both sides of the  war on terror. It is a sobering thought  for Americans to think that every time  they go to put gasoline in their tanks  they\u2019re funding both sides of the war  on terror.  That alone should be enough to make  us change our approach. That alone  should be enough to say let\u2019s use our  oil and our resources instead of propping up the economies of other nations.  That alone should be something that  motivates us  to make  sure we are  working on  these  issues. Hopefully,  that means we can melt this moratorium on our own domestic oil production.  The choice is ours. I hope all of my  colleagues will choose to support jobs  of the United States of America as opposed to supporting those dollars that  are just going to other countries.  f  EAT THE FUTURE OR LOSE THE  FUTURE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. COHEN) for 5 minutes.  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, by recklessly slashing more than $60 billion  from the budget, the Republican majority is trying to assume the mantle of  fiscal responsibility. Yes, fiscal. Sometimes we  in politics have problems  with pronunciations, and sometimes we  have problems with concepts. There are  two  \u2018\u2018fiscals.\u2019\u2019 There  is the  \u2018\u2018fiscal\u2019\u2019  dealing with dollars, F-I-S-C-A-L, and  there is the \u2018\u2018physical,\u2019\u2019 P-H-Y-S-I-C-A-  L. They are trying to assume the mantle of fiscal responsibility.  Within the $60 billion, there are certainly some cuts that should be made  that would be cost effective, and there  are other cuts that weren\u2019t made that  should have been made from the Defense Department, farm subsidies and  other places. Many of the programs  that were cut or that were severely underfunded are programs that have a  significant  financial  return.  In  fact,  many of these underfunded or eliminated programs actually save the government  far more money than they  cost.  Penny wise and pound foolish.  So the Republican claims that they  are  saving  the Federal Government  more than $60 billion is simply untrue.  Yes, they are eliminating $60 billion  from the budget, but in reality they  are increasing the deficit in other areas  that do not appear in the budget\u2014or  certainly not this year.  As Paul Krugman would say: Eat the  future or lose the future. They\u2019re not  concerned about the future. It\u2019s about  today; and if it\u2019s the future, it\u2019s the  2012 election.  The problem is that the Republicans\u2019  so-called \u2018\u2018budget hawks\u2019\u2019 fail to look  at  this holistically. The only costs  they see are numbers on a page that  they want to hold up as talking points.  b1020  This slide shows some of the cuts.  The Food and Drug Administration received funding $241 million below 2010  and $400 million below the administration\u2019s 2011 budget request. That\u2019s the  Food and Drug Administration. Remember thalidomide babies? Remember Fen-Phen? Remember the problems  with meat, chicken, poultry, and spinach?  Food Safety and Inspection Service:  It makes cuts of $88 million below the  2010  funding  levels and  $107 million  below the administration\u2019s 2011 budget  request.  The National  Institutes of Health:  Cuts appropriations for the NIH by $1.6  billion below FY 2010 and $2.5 billion  below  the President\u2019s  budget. You  know  the  National  Institutes  of  Health\u2014they\u2019re trying to find cures for  Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s and diabetes and cancer. Oh, let\u2019s cut them by  $1.6 billion.  Clean drinking water: The Republican bill slashes the Clean Water and  Drinking Water State Revolving Fund  by 56 percent. EPA: The bill includes  an undesignated $300 million recision  to EPA.  Medicare: Cuts appropriations for the  Centers  for Medicare  and Medicaid  Services by $458 million below fiscal  year 2010 and $634 million below the  President\u2019s budget request.  However, what they  failed to consider are the benefits associated with  these costs, many of which generally  exceed the cost. And by failing to consider money saved, the Republicans are  increasing the deficit and  increasing  cost.  Nowhere is this failure in fiscal policy more apparent than when it comes  to the physical health of the American  people. The Republican\u2019s  continuing  resolution will increase the deficit dramatically as a result of unseen health  care costs associated with the degradation of the air we breathe, the water we  drink, and the food we eat.  Now the physical impact of the Republican cuts. The FDA: $241 million.  The Republican majority is working to  undo this historic improvement and reduce food safety by cutting FDA\u2019s food  safety programs by about $241 million.  In the United States, an estimated 76  million people get sick each year with  food-borne illnesses and 5,000 die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention. All of  the  medical costs and economic losses associated with food-borne illnesses add  up to a staggering price of $152 billion,  says the Pew Charitable Trusts. By  slashing funding from the FDA\u2019s food  safety programs, more and more people  will get sick, and the $152 billion annual pricetag is going to climb even  higher. That doesn\u2019t sound like a responsible physical or fiscal policy to  me.  Clean water: Although more than 70  percent of  the Earth  is covered  in  water, only about 1 percent of all the  water on the planet is safe to drink.  H.R. 1 will reduce that 1 percent by allowing major corporations and developers to pump toxins into our water,  and by failing to invest in the necessary  infrastructure  to maintain,  treat, and deliver safe drinking water.  It reduces the Drinking Water State  Revolving Fund by 56 percent, a program that leverages significant private  finances by providing low and no-interest loans to States to fund drinking  water  infrastructure  improvement  projects.  Leaking  pipes  and  deteriorating  mains lead to costly bacteria contamination and cause chronic health problems to thousands of Americans.  As you can see, the physical health of  our Nation  is being threatened, not  just the fiscal health. We need to be  concerned about the physical health of  our children and be concerned about  how the long-term effects of this will  be.  f  A TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN  STEVE HORN  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  California (Mr. DREIER) for 5 minutes.  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, the week  before last, just before we adjourned,  we got the sad news of the passing of  our good friend and former colleague  Congressman Steve Horn.  Steve Horn was without a doubt one  of  the most  intelligent and accomplished Members to ever serve in this  body, and at the same time, Mr. Speaker, he was one of the kindest and most  decent Members. He got his bachelor\u2019s  degree from Stanford University, his  master\u2019s from Harvard, and went back  and got his Ph.D. at Stanford University. He served in strategic intelligence  in the early 1950s in the U.S. Army Reserve, and then he got involved in public service in a big way. He served in  the Eisenhower administration, and he  went on to become legislative assistant  to California Senator Tom Kuchel.  From that point  forward, he dedicated himself to public service, and he  expanded that greatly. He got into education, and  for nearly  two decades,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:41 Mar 01, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K01MR7.005 H01MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",

Mr. BOEHNER. What helps make the  People\u2019s House so special is its people.  Every day, the staff members here give  their time and energy not just doing  the job, but fulfilling the mission of  keeping this body closest to the American people.  Members come and go, but some dedicated  public  servants  connect  the  House\u2019s history to its future. Pat Kelly  is a shining example of this.  Like many Americans, Pat joined the  family business right out of college.  She went to work for her mother, Congresswoman Edna Kelly, who was the  first woman to represent Brooklyn. Pat  went on to serve as a legislative assistant for other members of the New York  delegation and the Rules Committee.  For more than 30 years now, Pat has  had a bird\u2019s-eye view of the House as  editor of the Daily Digest of the CONGRESSIONALRECORD. The Digest serves  as the  \u2018\u2018table of contents\u2019\u2019  for each  day\u2019s proceedings on the House floor  and in all of the committees. And Pat\u2019s  job is a daily feat of precision\u2014and patience\u2014that requires pulling together  information from dozens of offices. And  I know all of Pat\u2019s colleagues admire  her thoughtfulness and attention to detail.  Today she is retiring after 54 years of  service to this  institution. And  it\u2019s  clear that Pat has not merely recorded  the House\u2019s history\u2014she\u2019s been a rich  part of it, too.  When the House paid tribute to Edna  Kelly in 1998, Pat was quoted as saying  of her mother that she was a great person to emulate. Well, let the same be  said of Pat, and may all current and future public servants be inspired by her  example.  Pat, we\u2019re sorry to see you go. On behalf of all the Members of the House  and staff, thank you for the dedication  to this institution, and thank you for  your service.  f  HONORING PAT KELLY  (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker,  I  am  pleased  to  join  the Speaker of  the  House to honor a committed public  servant, a woman of this House, a key  thread  in the  fabric of the congressional staff, who retires today after 54  years of service: Pat Kelly. Fifty-four  years of service.  Since arriving as a committee staffer  in 1957, Pat Kelly has worked behind  the scenes on behalf of the American  people\u2014never asking  for recognition,  never looking for the limelight.  The  daughter  of  Congresswoman  Edna Kelly, Pat said she came to Washington because, in her words, \u2018\u2018I just  felt the urge to do something.\u2019\u2019 And for  more than half a century, she did far  more than her fair share.  Pat Kelly has served in many roles  on Capitol Hill. In all, she helped Members to do their jobs and worked tirelessly on issues important to her and  critical to our country\u2019s future.  Few issues played a larger role for  her than the fight for women\u2019s rights.  In 1962, she helped her mother pass the  first equal pay bill and watched with  pride as President John F. Kennedy  signed it into law.  As a legislative aide to former Congresswoman Martha  Griffiths,  Pat  fought for the Equal Rights Amendment\u2014continuing the march for equality, advancing the cause of justice for  all women. Thank you, Pat. We\u2019re all  in your debt.  Through it all, whether the legislation succeeded or failed, she stood by a  simple mantra:  \u2018\u2018It\u2019s  important  for  women to be involved.\u2019\u2019  For the past 22 years she has served  as editor of the House Daily Digest,  tracking committee activities and getting the word out on what\u2019s happening  on Capitol Hill. In that role she has  noted, \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve been through the turnover  to Republicans and back to Democrats,  and tried to help each and every one of  them do their jobs.\u2019\u2019  Helping others do their jobs, working  in a bipartisan way\u2014this was the essence of Pat Kelly\u2019s career and service.  Pat Kelly\u2019s  54 years  serving  the  House of Representatives is a reflection  of her own dedication to Congress and  the country, and represents the commitment, devotion to duty, and passion  for service of all of our congressional  staffers.  Thank you, Pat, for giving so much  to the House, for all of your work, and  for fulfilling your promise to \u2018\u2018do something\u2019\u2019 for all Americans.  Yes, I join the Speaker in saying you  will be missed. We are sorry that you  are leaving. We wish you much success  and, with deep gratitude, send you our  love and best wishes.  f  MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE  A message from the Senate by Ms.  Curtis, one of  its clerks, announced  that the Senate has agreed to the following resolution:  S.

There isn\u2019t any economic theory that  I\u2019ve  ever heard of  called  \u2018\u2018cut and  grow.\u2019\u2019  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an  additional 30 seconds.  Mr. DICKS. So, again,  it was the  Democratic Congress that cut the $41  billion. And every reputable economist  says what you did in H.R. 1 is going to  have a negative effect on the economy.  And so I hope you all think carefully  about what you\u2019re about to do.  Again, it takes compromise. You\u2019ve  got to work with the other body to  come up with a reasonable solution  here, or we\u2019re going to have problems  with a government shutdown. And you  can say whatever you want, but we  don\u2019t need the government shutting  down when we\u2019re in two wars, a war in  Afghanistan and a war in Iraq, and a  global war on terror. We don\u2019t need to  shut the government down.  b1310  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 30 seconds only to say that\u2019s  why we\u2019re here  today, as  the gentleman knows, so that there is no government shutdown. And I could not be  more proud that we\u2019re here taking that  responsibility exactly as seriously as it  is.  It\u2019s very difficult to have a conversation about jobs when we have carbon  regs coming down the pipe that will destroy jobs and we have financial regulations coming down the pipe that will  destroy jobs and we have health care  regs coming down the pipe that will destroy  jobs over and over again. My  folks are saying \u2018\u2018enough.\u2019\u2019  With that, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from  California (Mr. DREIER), the chairman  of the Rules Committee, the gentleman  that I give credit to for giving us the  most open process on a continuing resolution  that we\u2019ve  seen  in modern  times.  Mr.  yield?  Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gentleman from Washington.  Mr. DICKS. That was a good process.  I appreciate what you all did in having  an open rule. I applaud Chairman ROGERSand Chairman DREIER. That is the  right thing to do. It was appreciated on  both sides of the aisle.  Mr. WOODALL. And we could not  have done it without your support.  Mr. DICKS. I did my best to help.  (Mr. DREIER asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker,  let me  just say, I was going to begin by saying  that both my colleagues, Mr. ROGERS  and Mr. DICKS, did an absolutely phenomenal job at taking on the responsibility that is thrust on them when we  have an open amendment process.  DICKS. Will  the  gentleman  The people who go through the greatest challenge are those who have to defend the bill and be here for hours and  hours and hours. And as we all know,  we had 162 amendments considered on  the House floor during those days that  led up to before adjournment week before  last. And we worked  into  the  morning  on  every  occasion.  That  means after midnight. I mean, I guess  we adjourned at 2 or 3 on some of those  days. I was sound asleep then, I have to  admit. But you guys were working  very, very hard, Mr. Speaker. And I  want to thank them.  And I was pleased that those in the  minority did recognize that doing what  we did was unprecedented. Never before  has a continuing resolution been considered under the process that we\u2019ve  had. At best,  it\u2019s been a structured  rule, which is what we had two decades  ago, and both political parties had had  usually a closed rule for the consideration of continuing resolutions up to  that point. So I do believe that we have  come together with, as Mr. WOODALL  has  said,  a  package  that  included  amendments  from both sides of the  aisle as we proceed with this.  Now, I was tickled also to hear my  friend talk about the fact that $41 billion in cuts were made under Democratic leadership. The fact that both  sides of the aisle are now talking about  and bragging about ways to cut spending is, I think, a very encouraging sign,  because that is the message. That\u2019s the  message that Mr. WOODALLwas just offering. The constant expansion of government is, in fact, counterproductive  in our quest to create jobs and get the  economy moving.  Now, we had this exchange last night  in  the Rules Committee\u2014yesterday  afternoon in the Rules Committee, Mr.  Speaker,  in which we were  talking  about Mark Zandi and the Goldman  Sachs projections as  far as bringing  about spending reductions.  And I brought to the fore one of the  most brilliant economists I know, John  Taylor, who is at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University, former undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, a very good personal  friend of mine. His son used to work in  our office. He\u2019s serving in the United  States Marine Corps. And I\u2019ve got to  say, Mr. Speaker, that John Taylor, in  responding to the Zandi quote, made it  very clear that the notion of not bringing about spending reductions would in  fact  exacerbate  the  economic  challenges that we have. And the bottom  line is: The best way for us to get our  economy growing is to ensure that people can keep more of their hard-earned  money and to restrict the kind of control that the Federal Government has  continued to thrust on individuals.  I\u2019d be happy to yield to my friend if  he would like to share one of those  quotes.  Mr. DICKS. Let me just make a brief  comment.  And I do applaud the gentleman from  California as chairman of the Rules  Committee for giving, for working out  that modified open rule.  Just let me, on the point about Mr.  Taylor at Stanford, Stanford\u2019s a very  good school. My son graduated from it,  and I\u2019m quite proud of that.  A letter signed by 300 of America\u2019s  leading economists makes the argument  that cutting  investments  this  quickly will undermine growth. Among  the  original  signers  from Stanford  alone: Kenneth Arrow, Martin Carnoy,  Paul David, Mordecai Kurz, Roger Noll,  and Gavin Wright.  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, if I could  reclaim my time, I would say to my  friend I think what we\u2019ve just shown is  that the proverbial economists say on  one hand, on the other hand.  The  fact  is not  every  economist  agrees on this notion, but a statement  has been made. And, in fact, my friend  made it upstairs, and that is, he said  when he was quoting Mark Zandi, that  everyone, basically every economist\u2014  and that is what I inferred from the  statement\u2014came  to  this conclusion.  And my point in actually referencing  Professor Taylor is that there is disagreement on it.  I happen to come down on the side,  personally, of Mr. Taylor. I think it\u2019s  important for us, just because we want  to all encourage individual initiative  and  responsibility,  to do everything  that we can to reduce the size and  scope and reach of government\u2014and  that\u2019s what the goal of H.R. 1 is\u2014so  that we can get the economy growing.  And I believe that more incentives by  reducing that tax and regulatory burden will create  jobs, because we do  share that goal. I mean, I\u2019m convinced  that everyone wants to do that.  But this notion, I mean I\u2019ve heard  commentators  saying  that  somehow  that Republicans  in saying that we  might see a reduction in the number of  Federal Government jobs, that we\u2019re  not for job creation. We want people to  have good, long-term jobs in the private sector, and that\u2019s our goal here.  This rule is a standard rule. I should  say at the outset that we wanted to  have this not a closed rule but a modified closed rule. And I know my friend  was  concerned  that his amendment  that he testified on behalf of in the  Rules Committee wasn\u2019t made in order.  But I will tell you that we did, from  the very beginning, say to the minority  leader, Ms. PELOSI, that she, when having introduced on February 18 her substitute proposal  that basically kept  spending at 2010 levels, that we would  have made that in order and it would  have made it a modified closed rule  that we had offered, so we did do that.  We are where we are. Ensuring that  we don\u2019t go  through a government  shutdown is something that Chairman  ROGERSand I know Mr. DICKSand all of  us  in  leadership positions, rank-and-  file Members alike, want to avoid, and  that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got this 2-week package that\u2019s before us. I hope the Senate  will act so that we can do that, and  then do what we all want to make sure  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:26 Mar 02, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K01MR7.042 H01MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",
            "27": "March 1, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE H1419  economist for Senator JOHNMCCAIN in  his Presidential bid.  Let me be clear. I am very supportive  of the removal of earmarks in this resolution. They should be cut. We understand the need for deficit reduction.  The question is where do we start?  Our  first priority should be to go  after waste and special interest spending:  $40 billion  to  the oil  industry  which we are providing today, $40 billion. What about the almost $8 billion  to multinational  corporations  who  take  their  jobs overseas? And, yes,  what about the $8 billion in agricultural subsidies?  It is too bad that cutting these special interest subsidies is not the priority of the majority\u2019s resolution. Instead,  this budget makes deep and  reckless cuts in the areas that most  impact middle class and working families.  Of the $4 billion in immediate cuts  put forward by this 14-day resolution,  $1.4 billion comes out of Education,  Health and Human Services, and out of  training programs. And, yes, almost a  billion dollars, a quarter of the cuts,  comes  out  of  education. Education  should be one of the last places we look  to cut the budget, not the first.  Yes, these cuts could be achieved by  eliminating four programs proposed for  termination by the President, as well  as eliminating funding associated with  earmarks last year. But these are not  the President\u2019s  proposals. While he  would cut some education programs, he  would then reinvest those savings in  other education programs considered  more  effective. This  resolution  just  wipes out the funding.  This resolution severely cuts efforts  to reduce illiteracy, which is a serious  national problem for economic, as well  as human, reasons. The  largest program targeted, Striving Readers, represents a consolidation and reorganization of literacy programs that was just  launched in 2010. Why would the Republican majority think it is responsible to strip away funding to improve  literacy in this country before it even  has a chance to work?  I\u2019m particularly concerned and disappointed by the elimination of Even  Start. Even Start is about breaking the  cycle of poverty and illiteracy by improving educational opportunities for  families. I do not agree with the President\u2019s assessment that it should be terminated, and I do not support its elimination in this resolution. This is an effective and a critical program  that  should be allowed to continue.  I\u2019m not the only one concerned by  the consequences of this reckless budget. Three hundred leading economists  have signed a letter to the President  noting how these spending cuts will diminish our economic competitiveness.  Goldman Sachs reported to its investors that the Republican budget will  slash economic growth by 2 percent of  our economic growth. That would send  the unemployment numbers back over  10 percent.  Americans want us to craft a budget  for the remainder of the year that creates  jobs,  reduces  the  deficit,  and  strengthens the economy.  b1430  Do we start with slashing special interests and waste like the $40 billion  that we are providing in subsidies to  the oil companies? And last time any  of us looked, they were doing pretty  well. They don\u2019t need any subsidies. Or  do we start by cutting the things that  help the middle class, which help our  businesses, and working families with  children and with seniors?  This resolution increases unemployment. It will hurt our economic recovery. And I urge my colleagues to oppose this reckless resolution.  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. I yield 2  minutes to the chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Appropriations, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  KINGSTON).  Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the chairman for the time.  Madam Speaker,  I want  to make  three very important points right off  the bat:  Number one, our debt is almost at 95  percent of the GDP. It\u2019s the highest  debt we have ever had in history. Last  year alone the deficit was $1.5 trillion.  We are borrowing 40 cents for every $1  that we spend. Now, if you and I were  doing that in our households or our  business was doing it or anybody else,  you would  say, okay, we\u2019ve got  to  change our spending habits. But somehow there are those in Congress who  think that we can continue to defy the  laws of gravity. We have got to get our  house in order.  Number two, why are we here? We  are here because the Democrats last  year did not pass a budget, did not pass  appropriation bills, and did not complete their work on fiscal year 2011.  That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We are trying  to clean up the mess that was left to  us. And in doing that, we are mindful  of our financial situation and trying to  reduce some of the spending.  Number three, let me say this. This  bill was passed with an open rule. Indeed, I believe we had 127 votes on different amendments. Democrats and Republicans offered a myriad of amendments. Now, for those who are complaining on the floor today that they  don\u2019t like these cuts, why didn\u2019t they  offer their amendments on the floor a  couple of weeks ago? That would have  been the way to do this. Now, the  chairman and the Speaker have committed to have open rules throughout  this process this year, and so there will  be a lot of opportunities to go after  some of these programs. And some of  the ones that are mentioned, I think I  will support those cuts. But I just want  to emphasize that everyone has had a  bite of this apple.  Finally, let me just say this, Madam  Speaker. The Zandi report comes from  an economist, a political economist we  might say, who was the same person  who told us the stimulus bill would  work, the stimulus bill would keep us  from going to 8 percent unemployment.  We reached 10 percent. I don\u2019t think we  need to listen to any more of his advice.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. I yield the  gentleman an additional 30 seconds.  Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the chairman.  I just want to say that I don\u2019t think  that Mr. Zandi has any more credibility. We have already spent $800 billion on his advice that the stimulus  program would work, and it did not  work.  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Will the  gentleman yield?  Mr. KINGSTON. I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky.  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.  Is  the  gentleman aware that Ben Bernanke,  the Chairman of the Federal Reserve,  now says that H.R. 1 would have no  harmful effect on the economy?  Mr. KINGSTON. I have heard that.  And I understand there is something  like 150 other economists who have  signed a letter to that effect that was  led by John Taylor, who is an economist as well.  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. And that  cutting spending and reducing the deficit will give confidence to the business  community to hire people and put people to work.  Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the chairman.  Mr. DICKS. I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlelady  from Texas  (Ms. JACKSON  LEE), one of our distinguished Members.  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Let me  thank the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and  let me  thank  the chairperson.  I  sometimes  have a slip of tongue, Mr. DICKS, and  call you \u2018\u2018chairman,\u2019\u2019 but I thank you  very much for this opportunity.  I want to just try to give a procedural class here today. The procedural  class  is  that  this  document  is  a  placeholder. I would hesitate to call it  a fake document, but that is what it is.  As I left my constituency, the last  words I heard were, \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t you all shut  down the government.\u2019\u2019 And I am glad  that Mr. DICKSworked hard to submit  his amendment  in  the Rules Committee. It\u2019s unfortunate that the wise  men and women didn\u2019t have a majority. The Republicans would not yield to  a thoughtful amendment by Mr. DICKS.  But this is a 2-week document. We  know how old, and what\u2014many of us  have seen a 2-week-old baby. That\u2019s  what this is: a 2-week document so we  can do the right thing.  It needs to be very clear that before  we left in the 110th Congress, Democrats had already cut $41 billion. Now,  many say we didn\u2019t have a budget. We  had a budget, but we had no compromise, no reconciliation, no fairness,  no concern about the American people.  Now we have spent 3 months, March  1, doing nothing, and not one bill creates a job. Goldman Sachs, I know that  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:26 Mar 02, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K01MR7.059 H01MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",
            "35": "March 1, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE H1427  they have a chance to vote to reduce  spending, reductions that the administration agrees with in its 2012 budget  and eliminating earmarks, the Democrats vote \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019? It\u2019s strange but true.  In fact, instead of cutting spending,  they propose to increase revenue. Or  increase taxes.  In this fragile economy with energy  prices rising, we should be encouraging  more energy and gas development and  production in the United States. We  need more supply, not less supply. This  would reduce the supply.  Oil prices are rising again; and with  the wave of unrest in the Middle East  and North Africa, there are fears that  we could soon see a return to $4 or $5  gas in the United States this summer.  b1540  The moratorium put  in place  following the Deepwater Horizon accident  was lifted last fall by the administration; but the administration has issued  just one deepwater permit in the gulf,  and that was issued just yesterday. The  Federal judge called this de facto deepwater drilling moratorium unreasonable, unacceptable, and unjustifiable.  The public will have no patience for  more delays, more excuses, and higher  taxes if gas prices continue to rise, especially when we have untapped resources here in the United States not  being utilized. We need to be encouraging more production in this country,  not discouraging production  in  this  country.  Oil and gas from Federal lands, both  onshore and offshore, provide an important energy source and domestic jobs  and billions of dollars of revenue to the  United States. This is a job-killing proposal. This is an issue that needs to be  addressed carefully and in great detail.  A rush to impose new taxes and fees  through a motion to recommit is hasty  and unwise.

I yield  to  the gentlewoman  North Carolina.  Ms.  ELLMERS.  Chairman.  I think we\u2019ve come to the point now  where we  do need  to  discuss  that  ObamaCare is not the answer. We have  all discussed this over and over again.  I would say that it\u2019s probably a good  reason that I was elected because I ran  on repealing it\u2014that and cutting taxes  and cutting spending. And it all ties in  together.  Those of us who are in health care  have been aware of the need for reform  for quite some time. I think any of us  can say that we\u2019ve seen the costs increase. We\u2019ve seen the cost of health  care insurance increase. And yet we\u2019ve  all felt that our hands were tied. We  didn\u2019t know how to address it. The bureaucratic system, as my colleagues  have pointed out,  just dealing with  billing and trying to get the care for  patients alone can just take over your  office.  b1720  We have seen these things. We know  there are problems that exist, but we  all agree that it needs to be a patient-  centered,  doctor-nurse-patient  relationship that we have to be putting forward. And it has to be in the private  sector. There are ways  to do  this.  There is a role for government in it, especially when we are talking about  Medicare, Medicaid, and those who are  unfortunate. We want everyone to have  health care. But there are ways we can  address it.  It is not a health care crisis; it is a  crisis of culture. We have to change the  culture that we are dealing with. We  want  everyone  to  have  affordable  health care, and there are simple solutions we can put in place to do that.  Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. I am so  glad that I called on the gentlewoman  from North Carolina and she brought  up this point, colleagues, because what  RENEEELLMERS just said is absolutely  the truth. We are not on this side of  the aisle, and those Democrats who  agree with us, we are not opposed to reforming the health insurance industry,  to eliminating abusive practices such  as canceling policies after the fact or  denying children with preexisting conditions, and that is exactly what the  gentlewoman from North Carolina was  referencing.  The pledge to repeal ObamaCare is  because in our humble opinion it is too  bad to  fix. That doesn\u2019t mean that  when we replace it, and we may have to  do it piece by piece, bit by bit, that we  don\u2019t incorporate some of the things in  there that most people would agree are  good, like allowing youngsters, young  adults, Mr. Speaker, to stay on the  health insurance policy of their parents until they are 26 years old. With  this economy and the destruction of  jobs because of bailouts and stimulus,  trillions of dollars that don\u2019t work, unfortunately, our young college graduates have no job to go to; otherwise,  they would have health insurance from  their place of work. So they darn well  need to stay on their parents\u2019 policy  until they are 26, and maybe until they  are 36 if we don\u2019t quite get our act together and quit spending and get this  economy going.  Let me yield quickly to the gentleman from Tennessee, Dr. ROE, my  OB\u2013GYN colleague from Tennessee.  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. I thank the  gentleman for yielding.  When I came, as we all did, doctors,  physicians tend to look at a problem.  When a patient comes  in, the  first  thing we ask them, Dr. GINGREY: Why  are you here today? It is a fairly obvious question. It is called the chief complaint.  When I came to Washington, D.C., I  asked the same thing about the American health care system. I said: What is  the problem with the American health  care  system?  I  thought  there were  probably three.  Number one, it was too expensive.  The  cost  of health  care had  skyrocketed way above inflation so it is  way too expensive to come see a doctor  or go to the hospital.  The  second  issue  I  saw you  just  brought up was that there was a segment of our population  that didn\u2019t  have access to affordable health insurance coverage. These are not the very  poor who had access in my State to  TennCare or in other States to Medicaid, but these are folks who are out  working. Maybe they are a carpenter  and their wife stays at home. Or maybe  they have a  job, a  small business,  where they can\u2019t afford it. So there was  that segment that didn\u2019t have it.  Lastly, there is a liability crisis in  America. Our friends on the other side,  our trial lawyer friends can tend to say  that is not the case, but let me give  you a personal example. When I started  my medical practice, probably about  the same time you did, Dr. GINGREY, it  cost $360. That was the first baby I delivered in 1977 that I got paid for. I was  out of the Army and out of my training, $360. My first year\u2019s salary was  $32,000. That is what I made my first  year in practice. I delivered 260 babies  that year; a lot of babies. The next  year I was up to $60,000 a year. My malpractice was $4,000 a year. When I came  to Congress  2 years ago,  the malpractice in Tennessee for an obstetrician was $74,000. And there is no value  that we get, that patients get  from  that. We will go into that when we  have another hour.  But the thing about the ObamaCare  plan that bothered me was it did nothing to bend the cost curve.  If you  looked at this and if you look at plans  that have been out there in the past,  Medicare, for instance, came on board  in 1965 as a $3 billion program; $3 billion in 1965.  The estimators, there was no Congressional Budget Office then or folks  who make  these estimates, but  the  government estimators at that time  said in 25 years this will be a $15 billion  program. The actual number was over  $100 billion. And today it is over $500  billion.  In Tennessee, we noticed we had the  same problem 20 years ago. We have  been through all of this before. Unfortunately, no one here chose to listen to  us in our Doctors Caucus. We said we  had lack of access and we had prices  rising back in the 1990s, the early 1990s,  exactly the same debate that we are  having today except today it is more  severe than it was.  We spent $2.6 billion on TennCare in  1993. In 2004, 2005, just 10 budget years  later, it was up to $8.5 billion. The cost  had tripled.  So when you  see  these cost estimates\u2014and remember that the same  CBO, and these are good folks. I\u2019m not  pointing the finger at them. It is very  hard to do what they do. They are  given a set of data. They crunch the  numbers and they hand them to us.  They only missed this year\u2019s budget  deficit by $400 billion in 1 year. So I am  to stand here and believe, looking at  these other examples I have just given  you, that this is going to be budget  neutral in 10 years? There is no way it  will be.  I know we have a lot to discuss. I\u2019m  sorry I was a little late. I had some  folks from the great University of Tennessee in my office to see. I look forward to continuing this discussion.  Mr. GINGREY of Georgia. Dr. ROE,  we appreciate you being with us.  I  know the time is rapidly coming to a  close.  But, Mr. Speaker, I guess the last  slide basically says it all, cuts right to  the chase: ObamaCare steals Americans\u2019 liberty. Our forefathers intended  certain basic rights\u2014life, liberty, pursuit of happiness\u2014to be inalienable\u2014  that means can\u2019t be taken away from  you\u2014and  consider  them  self-evident  and universal.  ObamaCare lets the boss steal liberty  from every American by forcing them  to buy health insurance whether they  want it or need it or not. We can encourage them to have it and try to  make it possible and affordable. But to  force them to do it, the next thing we  know, everybody will be eating broccoli by government edict because it is  healthy, it is healthy food. They are  going to have a hard time getting me  to eat broccoli.  But I am telling you the judge in  Florida, Judge Vincent, and the judge  in  the Commonwealth  of Virginia,  Judge Hudson, they got it right. We  need  expedited  processing  of  those  suits so the Supreme Court will tell the  American people  this  is unconstitutional and will not stand.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back  the balance of my time.

            "51": "March 1, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE H1443  their ideals are, but they have hit the  end of their patience line.  So here we are. Here we are with a  continuing resolution that the government is operating on today that was  negotiated  and  passed here  in  the  House and in the Senate in December.  It extended the funding for the government over until March 4 of this year;  midnight, March 4, which is somewhere  around Friday night, I think. Maybe  Thursday night.  So there has been an action here on  the floor to pass a continuing resolution to do temporary stopgap funding  to keep the government running for another 2 weeks, up until March 18. And  that CR has now been messaged to the  Senate. And the Senate can decide if  they want to take it up tomorrow or  the next day, get it to the President\u2019s  desk. If the President signs the CR, the  government  keeps  running;  if  the  President  doesn\u2019t,  the  government  shuts down.  I am watching as my colleagues seem  to think that there is one data point of  message for them to learn from, that  because there was a government shutdown  in  1995,  it was one  that was  pushed for by Republicans, it was driven by Republicans. They wanted to face  President Clinton down and  insisted  that they pass a balanced budget and  to get to a balanced budget. In spite of  all of the things that happened in 1995  and in early 1996, that was the result,  Madam Speaker. They shortly had a  balanced budget, and  that balanced  budget came a lot sooner than it would  have otherwise and it lasted at least  until such time we were hit by September 11 and the calamity that sent  this America  into  an  overspending  binge.  I think we could have faced the calamity of September 11 without having  to blow our budget in the way we did,  but that  is not what happened. But  what did happen in 1995, if that is the  only data point, I want to make this  point, Madam Speaker. First of all,  there are thousands and thousands of  students all over America who are  studying  political  science. Some  of  them are watching tonight. Some of  them are  reading  in  the paper  the  things that we say and we do, and they  are analyzing it. They are listening to  their professors analyze what goes on  here in Congress, and they are listening to the instruction of the rules, the  standards, the axioms that come from  certain data points along the line of  continuum of political history. And  that one data point on that line of continuum of political history is the government shutdown of 1995, and some of  it drug over into very early 1996, and  the argument  is that House Republicans lost that because they had to  concede their position to the President  and to the Senate.  Well, it is a fact that the House had  to concede. They did concede. It is also  a fact that the Republicans that controlled the Senate at the time passed a  unanimous consent agreement to go  ahead and spend the money that was  demanded by Bill Clinton and send it  over here to the House. The House was  in a position where they couldn\u2019t push  that chain back uphill and President  Clinton and the Senate got their way  and imposed it over the House.  But I will still say that there is not  a dime that can be spent by the Federal Government if the House of Representatives  insists  that  it not  be  spent. We have to concede and go along  with it at some point, or it won\u2019t be  spent. And  the negotiating position  that was there for the House Republicans in 1995 was one that was marginally stronger because they had at least  a majority in the Senate. That is the  difference in the dynamics. But it was  also about $300 billion, as I recall, on  Medicare spending.  So whenever you put down a dollar  figure and you try to stand on that as  a principle, it is a different stance than  if you put something that is principle  down and stand on it. For example,  whether we are going to spend $300 billion on Medicare in 1995, or 250 or 200 or  150 or 100 or no more, you will lose or  gain people along that line of that continuum. If you want to cut Medicare by  $350 billion, you would lose some people  that might be with you at 300. And if  you move the line up $400 billion, 450,  you lose some people who might have  been with you at 350 or 400.  Money is something that there is a  sliding scale. You cannot find a principle there that you can stand on. It is  like going to an auction and seeing  something that you want. And maybe  you go to the auction and you decide I  want to buy a bicycle and I am willing  to pay $100 for that bicycle. If you go to  the auction and the auctioneer is crying out he has a bid for $100, now he  wants $101, do you pay that extra $1  and go home with the bicycle, something to show for it? Or do you say, no,  that was my principle. My principle  was I am not going to spend more than  $100.  Well, some people live by that principle. I do, occasionally. But it is not a  principle that is tied to anything that  is definable from a sense of right and  wrong. It is a percentage scale. If $100  was the right number, it is only 1 percent wrong to pay $101. If you get it for  $99, do you have any more virtue? No,  you just got a bargain from what you  anticipated.  But when you stand on a principle, it  is a different story. The principle here  that is better for the House to stand on  than the principle of the $300 billion in  1995 is the principle that we must not  be funding ObamaCare willfully with  appropriations bills here in the House.  We must not do so because every Republican and a handful of Democrats,  and there will be more, voted to repeal  ObamaCare.  We passed the repeal and sent it over  to HARRYREID. Furthermore, now that  that has happened, every Republican,  with H.R. 1, has voted to shut off any  funding that can be used to implement  or enforce ObamaCare. That is also a  fact. They are principled votes. They  are not votes that are measured on the  dollar figure. In fact, most people who  voted in that fashion didn\u2019t know how  much money it actually saved us for  voting to repeal ObamaCare.  And it is hard for me to take a position on that.  I\u2019ll  just say that the  chairman of the Budget Committee,  PAULRYAN, has used the words about  $2.6 trillion  is the spending that  is  saved by repealing ObamaCare.  That is the best number we have, and  I don\u2019t disagree with that. I accept  that number, but it is hard to come  down to something and then argue are  we doing it because of the money savings. Did we vote to repeal ObamaCare  because it would stop the spending of  $2.6  trillion?  I  think  not, Madam  Speaker.  b1840  I think it\u2019s part of it. It\u2019s part of the  equation\u2014and we can\u2019t afford it\u2014but  there are many other principles. The  most  important  one  is: ObamaCare  takes American  liberty, and puts  it  into the hands of government to manage our, I\u2019ll say, the second most sovereign thing we have, which is our bodies and our health.  That\u2019s  what\u2019s  wrong  with  ObamaCare; it\u2019s a matter of principle.  It\u2019s the takings of American  liberty  that must be stopped. No, we can\u2019t afford it, and it\u2019s money that\u2019s better  spent by doctor-patient relationships  and by individuals making decisions on  their health insurance and moving on  down the line with those conservative  principles. We need to stand on principle.  We have this opportunity here in this  112th Congress to stand on principle.  The stance needs to be that we will not  vote to fund ObamaCare. I\u2019m going to  add to this that neither shall we vote  to  fund Planned Parenthood, and  I  shall be looking for ways to unfund  every other entity like them that promotes abortion or provides abortion as  a matter of practice in their facilities.  Planned Parenthood has  invested  in  promiscuity, but that\u2019s a longer discussion than  I will engage  in tonight,  Madam Speaker.  I do think these two issues are tied  very closely together going forward in  that ObamaCare funding must be shut  off, and we cannot be asking our Members to vote again to appropriate funds  that can be used to fund ObamaCare.  Some will be saying we didn\u2019t have  ObamaCare funding in this short-term  CR,  just as  they  said  there wasn\u2019t  ObamaCare  funding  in  the CR  that  passed at the end of December that  takes us to the 4th of March, but here  is the answer to this:  There are at least 21 different components  to ObamaCare  that are beneficiaries of funding that go into the  various departments. There is no prohibition for that money going into or for  being used to implement or to force  ObamaCare. There are at least 21 different areas.

            "59": "March 1, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE H1451  The Washington Post  reads: Lawmakers should also endorse the sensible legislation introduced by myself  to outlaw the sales of high-capacity  ammunition  clips  that  enabled Mr.  Loughner to shoot some 30 bullets in a  matter of seconds. A drug abuse history or not, no one, in my opinion,  should be able to have the possession of  a weapon  that could  so easily and  senselessly be used  to  slaughter  so  many of our citizens, our neighbors, in  such a short period of time.  The Seattle Times, The Denver Post,  The Salt Lake Tribune, the Charlotte  Observer,  the  Louisville, Kentucky  Courier-Journal, and The Tennessean  are all basically saying  it\u2019s time to  look at reducing the violence that is in  our cities, our communities, our towns.  One of the ways we can do that is by  getting rid of the large capacity clips.  The Arizona Daily Star noted that no  one outside of law enforcement and the  military needs to fire 30-plus rounds  without interruption. Hunters do not.  Neither do target shooters or those  who carry guns for self-defense.  Let me remind people that a gun that  anyone uses that has a clip will still  have 10 bullets and one in the chamber.  That\u2019s 11 bullets that someone can use  for self-defense. There is no question  that  fewer people would have been  killed and injured on January 8 if the  shooter had possessed a magazine with  a capacity of just 10 rounds.  Gail Collins  said Congress  should  have an actual debate about Representative MCCARTHY\u2019s bill to reduce gun violence.  Even traditional, conservative, pro-  gun advocate Nick Kristof talks about  the contrast of guns with automobiles.  He turned it upside down to argue that,  in reality\u2014and this is true\u2014for a long  time, motor vehicles were dangerous,  but slowly, slowly we made them quite  safe. The trade-off is that we have modestly curbed individual freedom, but we  can save tens of thousands of  lives  every year. That\u2019s a model for how we  should approach guns and a public  health concern.  I talked about individual leaders who  support H.R. 308. It is a long list, and  many people have  stood up: Mayor  Bloomberg from New York City, my  great city; Philadelphia Mayor Michael  Nutter,  another member  of Mayors  Against  Illegal Guns, also expressed  support; I had mentioned Vice President Dick Cheney, of all people, who  said it would be appropriate to reinstate a ban on high-capacity magazines  like we had before.  Other public officials and individuals  around the country also support this  bill: The New York Police Department  said  that  a  legislative  solution  to  eliminating extended magazines would  be best; the President of the Alabama  Sheriffs\u2019 Association is a supporter; the  Minneapolis police chief is a supporter;  the Palm Beach County commissioner;  the Montana Secretary of State; President Bob Brown, an NRA member and  hunter who owns 18 guns, supports my  of  New  York.  legislation; the nurse who treated Ronald Reagan after he was shot supports  this; the fiancee and family of Gabe  Zimmerman, one of our own staffers  who was killed in Arizona, support this  bill.  You mentioned our police officers,  BILL. If anybody would be interested,  we\u2019ve had more police officers killed  since January of this year until now  than we\u2019ve had in the last number of  years. We say that we are there for our  police officers. You were a mayor, and  I know you stood by your police officers. I know that police officers around  the country know when they\u2019re facing  these large capacity clips and they\u2019re  outgunned,  as  they were when we  passed the assault weapons bill.  So, BILL, I know you are where I am,  and I thank you for the support that  you have given me, because we did  come in together, but it\u2019s people like  yourself who are willing to speak out.  Mr. PASCRELL. Will the gentlelady  yield?  Mrs. MCCARTHY  Please.  Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I  would like you to take back to your  side\u2014and I\u2019ll take back to my side\u2014  that I know this has been a great leverage issue for the Republican Party. It  has been a third rail for the Democratic Party. We were told basically, in  so many words, to stay away from it.  Look, let\u2019s lay our cards on the table.  I think that this is something we can  agree to come together on common  ground and be a little bit more reasonable about our approach.  I thank you, Congresswoman MCCARTHY, for leading the way, as usual. You  know I will always be there in support  of what I think is very important legislation for the sanity of our country.  Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. And I  thank you again.  I just want to remind the American  people who might be listening tonight,  I need your help. I can do the battles  here. It\u2019s so easy to email your Member  of Congress or your Senator to say it\u2019s  time to get rid of the large magazines,  because there is no place in America  anymore that is safe. This can happen  anytime, any place. So I thank you for  listening to me tonight, and I thank  my friend for standing here with me  and talking about it.  I will say, in closing, it\u2019s 17 years  since the incident happened to my family. There is not a day that goes by  that I don\u2019t remember what happened,  and that\u2019s why I continue to fight for  this issue. I don\u2019t want another family  to go through the pain. I don\u2019t want to  see another person die. I don\u2019t want to  see someone  injured  for the rest of  their life, and to fight those battles.  Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, in the wake  of the horrible tragedy in Arizona, Members of  Congress were united in condemning the violence. We expressed our prayers and hopes  for the recovery of our colleague, Congresswoman GABRIELLEGIFFORDS, and the others  injured in the attack, and we praised the heroic actions of ordinary Americans on that day.  But for our words to have meaning, Madam  Speaker, we also must act.  I\u2019m proud  to  join Representative CAROLYN  MCCARTHY in introducing the Large Capacity  Ammunition Feeding Device Act, to eliminate  access to clips that enable the kind of shooting spree that took place in Arizona. No one  can say that the ability to shoot more than ten  times\u2014without pausing to reload\u2014makes our  cities or our citizens any safer. The Assault  Weapons Ban of 1994 addressed this issue,  but perversely, by allowing it to expire in 2004,  we lost critical ground.  The importance of the ban was tangible in  each of our communities. When I first came to  Congress, East Palo Alto, a city in my district,  bore the awful distinction of being the \u2018\u2018Murder  Capital of the Country.\u2019\u2019 Today, the crime rate  has subsided. The ability to take these murderous assault weapons off the street played  a major role in that turnaround, and we should  not turn back the clock.  Madam Speaker, we all honor our Constitution and the Second Amendment. I, however,  see no connection between the primitive muskets our Founding Fathers contemplated and  the sophisticated, deadly weapons that plague  our streets today. The United States continues  to have the most per-capita gun deaths of any  developed nation. This is not a symbol of our  freedom. It\u2019s a capacity to kill, and this must  not eclipse our capacity to care. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this sensible  gun legislation which we are grateful to Representative MCCARTHY for authoring to better  protect our communities.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise  to join the vast majority of Americans, on both  sides of the gun debate, who want a safe and  sensible gun policy for their families and for  the United States of America.  In  the aftermath of  the  recent  tragedy  in  Tucson, one eminently  reasonable place  to  start\u2014one place where gun rights advocates  and gun control advocates should be able to  find common ground\u2014is  the Large Capacity  Ammunition Feeding Device Act (H.R. 308),  introduced by my colleague Rep. CAROLYN  MCCARTHY(D\u2013NY).  H.R. 308 is not about gun control. Instead,  it\u2019s about commonsense ammunition control.  The Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act sets aside all of the historically contentious debate around gun ownership and instead asks every American a very simple  question: Is it really necessary for non-law enforcement civilians to have access to high capacity, 33-round magazines like the one Jared  Lee Loughner used  to shoot our colleague  GABBYGIFFORDSand his other victims in Tucson?  I would submit that it is not. And I would further submit that the overwhelming majority of  Americans and law abiding gun owners would  agree that it is not. Consistent with that commonsense conclusion, the Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act would simply ban  the sale or  transfer of high-capacity magazines holding more than ten rounds. Law enforcement records show  that  the number of  high capacity magazines retrieved by police at  crime scenes dropped significantly  the  last  time this kind of restriction was in effect, and  common sense  tells you  that smaller magazines with less bullets will lead to less fatalities  and injuries during these kinds of horrific attacks.  Madam Speaker,  this  is not a partisan  issue. This is an American issue.

            "67": "March 1, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S1025  have to do it with common sense. We  don\u2019t want to take a meat ax to this  recovery and wind up losing jobs, jobs,  jobs.  This last election was all about jobs.  I was out there, so I can tell you. My  Republican opponent, every day, said:  Senator BOXER, where are the  jobs?  Where are the jobs? That was a legitimate question. I answered it this way:  It is taking too long to get these jobs  back where they should be, but I am  going to fight every day for jobs. When  I see a proposal that will threaten jobs,  I am going to talk about it.  I am going to get to the Republican  proposal for the rest of this year, the  2011 budget proposal, which  experts  such as Mark Zandi, a Republican expert who  advised Republican  candidates\u2014he advised JOHNMCCAIN. He  said, as well as Goldman Sachs, that if  you pass the Republican budget plan,  you endanger 700,000 jobs. So what do  we do? We have to cut spending, yes.  We have to do it wisely. We have to sit  together and discuss it, not say: My  way or the highway; here is the bill,  don\u2019t talk to me.  I think it is important, as we hear  the majority leader address his comments to the Democratic side, to address some comments to the Republican  side. When George Bush was  elected President, President Bill Clinton handed him a $236 billion budget  surplus. I am proud to say I served at  that time, and I voted for the Democratic  budget,  the  Clinton  budget.  What did it accomplish? Quite a bit.  Not only a balanced budget but a surplus. There were those on the other  side calling for an amendment to the  Constitution for a balanced budget. We  said: We don\u2019t need an amendment; we  just need to balance the budget in a  wise way, and we did it. We cut out unnecessary spending, but we  invested  where it created jobs. Guess what. We  said to the upper income people of $1  million or more: You have to pay your  fair share. They were willing and able  to do it, and we created not only surpluses in the Federal Government but  23 million new jobs.  Let me say that again. We created a  surplus\u2014not only a balanced budget  surplus but 23 million new jobs. Now  the Republicans take over, and when  George Bush leaves office, he created 1  million jobs in 8 years, compared to 23  million. Guess what. He left us a $1.3  trillion deficit.  I say to my  friends  here, he left the wars off budget, so it  was even way higher than that. He  didn\u2019t put the two wars on the budget.  President Obama, last year, created  more jobs than George Bush did. President Obama created, in 2010, 1.1 million  new jobs. So the new jobs under President Obama in 2010 equal the net jobs  of George Bush after 8 years. President  Obama inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit  from George Bush, who created that  from a surplus. It is important we follow this. George Bush created 1 million  jobs net compared to 23 million jobs  under  Bill  Clinton,  and  President  Obama  inherited the worst recession  since the Great Depression\u2014700,000 jobs  a month lost, panic on Wall Street, you  name it, the auto industry going out.  We would have been the only leader in  the industrialized world not to have an  auto industry.  It  is  fair to say things have stabilized. The auto industry had the best  year in a long time. The money we  loaned  to  the banks has been paid  back. But we have more to do. The deficit is up to $1.6 trillion now because  the wars are now on the budget, because we still haven\u2019t made up for the  revenues we lost, and the jobs are coming back too slowly.  This is where we stand. We have to  pass a budget for the remainder of this  year, and Democrats are saying let\u2019s do  it wisely. We will cut, cut, cut, and we  have a list of cuts we can go over. We  cut $40 billion from the President\u2019s 2011  budget. The Republicans cut $100 billion from the President\u2019s budget. So,  surely, between the 40 we cut and the  $100 billion they cut, we can meet and  solve this problem. I would like us to  do it right now\u2014sit down in good faith  and get it done and scratch any of the  cuts that hurt our children, scratch the  cuts that hurt our women\u2019s health,  scratch the cuts that are essentially  political\u2014I will go into those later\u2014  and come up with the cuts that don\u2019t  threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs.  Here is the deal. There is still talk  and fear about a government shutdown.  Every time we think we have passed  the point, there comes another article.  Today in the Washington Post there is  this article. I ask unanimous consent  to have this printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Washington Post, Mar. 1, 2011]  WITHGOVERNMENTSHUTDOWNLOOMING,  FRESHMENARETHEWILDCARDS  (By David A. Fahrenthold and Philip  Rucker)  In just two months, a freshman class of Republicans has found a way to run the House.  These  87 new members\u2014who  otherwise  might have become foot soldiers for party  bosses, or jittery pawns of their home-town  tea party groups\u2014have  instead  coalesced  into a bloc with its own ideas and a headstrong sense of its muscle.  As Republicans and Democrats try to cut a  short-term budget deal  this week\u2014and a  more permanent one in coming weeks\u2014the  freshmen are the wild card. They have the  power to derail the whole process. Again.  But even their own leaders don\u2019t know if  they will.  The  freshmen\u2019s willingness to do things  their way stems from their hyper-confident  vision of themselves, revealed in interviews  in recent days with more than 30 members of  the group. Many described their job as a  \u2018\u2018calling,\u2019\u2019 a sense that their grandchildren,  their country or their God needed them to  make hard decisions to right the government\u2019s finances.  \u2018\u2018We may be the last opportunity,\u2019\u2019 said  Rep. Michael G. Grimm (N.Y.), a former FBI  agent.  But now, the difficult part.  In the escalating budget fight\u2014and other  battles to come\u2014the freshmen will face the  capital\u2019s hardest kind of decision: how to  compromise on the issue they care about the  most.  How much ground will the freshmen give  before they defy the Senate and risk a government shutdown?  \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019\u2019 Rep. Joe Walsh (Ill.) said  when asked how the newcomers would react  if the Democratic-controlled Senate offered  a spending bill with fewer cuts than theirs. \u20191  don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. And I think most  freshmen don\u2019t know.\u2019\u2019  This class of Republican  freshmen\u2014the  largest for either party in at least six decades\u2014includes nine women and 78 men. Their  views are not all the same: Some have called  for a more nuanced approach to spending  cuts, while others have  insisted that the  House\u2019s  bare-bones  budget was not  bare  enough.  Many can recount the moment they realized they were mad enough to run for Congress.  Rep. Alan Nunnelee (Miss.) said that he  was happy as a state legislator, and that he  had resisted previous efforts to draft him as  a candidate. Then, on March 27, 2009, he  learned he was going to be a grandfather.  \u2018\u2018What  I  saw happening  in Washington  really was endangering the freedom\u2019\u2019 his new  grandson would have,Nunnelee said. \u2018\u2018I had a  moral obligation to do something about it.\u2019\u2019  Rep. Blake Farenthold (Tex.) was a talk-  radio host, one of more than three dozen  freshmen who had never held an elected office.  \u2018\u2018I really feel like I was called to run for office at this time,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018A whole bunch of  things all came together at once. . . . I can\u2019t  credit that to anything but divine intervention.\u2019\u2019  With that kind of back story, the freshmen  said  they  wouldn\u2019t  play  the  role  of  Congress\u2019s rookies. Instead of being taught  by  longtime  lawmakers, many said, they  wanted to teach.  \u2018\u2018When you say, \u2018We need to listen to the  American people,\u2019 that\u2019s us,\u2019\u2019 said Rep. Kevin  Yoder (Kan.), a former state legislator.  This group\u2014which represents about one-  third of  the Republicans  in  the House\u2014  showed its muscle last month, in a series of  private meetings with House Speaker John  A. Boehner (Ohio) and other GOP leaders.  At issue was how deep to cut spending in a  \u2018\u2018continuing resolution\u2019\u2019 to fund the government for the remaining seven months of this  fiscal year. During the midterm campaign,  Republicans had pledged to cut $100 billion  over a year.  But  the  leadership presented a number  equal to seven-twelfths of $100 billion.  The math worked. But, freshmen say, the  politics didn\u2019t.  \u2018\u2018We felt like we told the people that we  would do $100 billion,\u2019\u2019 said Rep. Trey Gowdy  (S.C.), a former prosecutor. \u2018\u2018And when you  start using the words \u2018pro-rata\u2019 or \u2018There\u2019s  seven months left in the budget\u2019\u2014as a prosecutor, when you\u2019re explaining, you\u2019re losing.\u2019\u2019  The leadership agreed, without much of a  fight, and went back to make additional reductions. In Congress\u2019s world of tradition  and seniority, the tail had officially wagged  the dog.  But from here on out, it will be harder to  be Congress\u2019s heroes.  Many of the freshmen say they want to  consider changes to Medicare, Social Security and other entitlement programs, which  have been political land mines in the past.  And Senate Democrats and the White House  probably will stop many of their proposals  cold.  \u2018\u2018We may not make it. Honestly. It may  blow up in our face as well,\u2019\u2019 said Rep.

            "75": "March 1, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S1033  patents, all of them designed to make  the U.S. more competitive in the global economy.  First, the America Invents Act will  give PTO the tools it needs to address  the unacceptably long backlog of patent applications. In February 2009, despite an increasing need for qualified  patent examiners, PTO  instituted a  hiring freeze. PTO is a user-fee supported organization and so it should be  able to pass through the costs of staffing needs to patent applicants. This  bill would finally give the PTO the authority to set its own fees rather than  having to wait for an act of Congress to  do so.  Another source of the backlog is the  issue of patent fee diversion. Currently,  the fees paid by applicants for the purpose of funding the costs of patent examination can be diverted away from  PTO to the Treasury without justification. Patent fee diversion cripples the  ability of PTO to do its job and is essentially a tax on innovation. In the  past 20 years, more than $800 million  have  been  diverted  from PTO  and  though  in  recent  years  almost  no  money has been diverted thanks to the  determined leadership of my colleague,  Senator MIKULSKI, PTO funding should  never depend on shifting political fortunes. Even in times of political favor,  the mere possibility of fee diversion is  harmful because  it robs PTO of the  ability to plan with confidence that a  varying workload will be matched by  funding.  This bill does not currently address  the issue of patent fee diversion, but  that is something that I and others are  working to change. Ending fee diversion is perhaps the single most effective thing that we can do to empower  PTO to reduce the patent backlog over  the long term. That is why I look forward  to  supporting  Dr.  amendment, which would ensure that  PTO has access to the  fees that  it  charges, subject to continuing congressional oversight, of course.  The second thing the America Invents Act does to make the United  States more competitive is to improve  the predictability and accuracy of the  patent  examination  process.  By  transitioning to a \u2018\u2018first to file\u2019\u2019 system, this bill brings the U.S. into line  with the rest of the world. Under \u2018\u2018first  to file,\u2019\u2019 PTO\u2019s task of determining the  priority of a patent application will be  more straightforward because patent  priority will depend on objective, public facts, rather than on secret files. To  smaller inventors who are concerned  that  \u2018\u2018first to  file\u2019\u2019 will allow  large  companies to beat them out in a race  to the patent office, this bill contains  important protections  for all  inventors. Even under \u2018\u2018first to file,\u2019\u2019 an inventor\u2019s patent priority  is protected  for a year if he or she is the first to  publicly disclose an invention.  Not only does the America Invents  Act make the patent process fairer to  inventors, but it will actually improve  the quality of patents issued by the  COBURN\u2019s  KYL PTO by leveraging the knowledge of  outside parties. This bill permits third  parties to provide submissions regarding prior art before a patent is issued,  enhancing the ability of examiners to  determine whether an application is for  a truly innovative idea worthy of the  protection of a patent.  The bill takes another step toward  improving patent quality by changing  the way the issuance of patents can be  challenged. The America Invents Act  introduces a 9-month post-grant review  process during which third parties can  challenge a patent on any grounds.  When  you  combine  the  new  pre-  issuance submission process and the  new post-grant review process, what  you get is a more rigorous and more  thorough vetting of patent applications.  We will get stronger, higher quality  patents because of the America Invents  Act.  Chairman LEAHY, along with his Republican cosponsors Senators HATCH,  and SESSIONS, deserve enormous  credit for the bill that was reported  unanimously by  the Judiciary committee just 4 weeks ago. The America  Invents Act  reflects years of hard-  fought negotiations between  the affected stakeholders.  At a time when bipartisanship is too  frequently  a  platitude  than  actual  process, it should be noted that the  America Invents Act shares wide bipartisan support. Senators from both parties worked together on the bill we  consider today, and both sides of the  aisle should be proud of what we accomplished.  I applaud Leaders REIDand MCCONNELLfor their commitment to the open  amendment process. Despite the broad  agreements that have been reached so  far, the Senate can and should consider  suggestions to change the bill. I know  that  I will  support Dr.  amendment on  fee diversion.  I also  hope that the Senate will accept an  amendment that  I have  filed which  would remove the section of the bill  dealing with venue.  While venue-shopping  is a  serious  problem, the current language in the  bill risks stunting the development of  case law, which has begun to address  the  problem  of  plaintiffs\u2019 manufacturing venue in districts that have a  reputation of being hospitable for patent suits. In fact, companies such as  Oracle and HP, while they  initially  supported legislative reform of venue,  now fear that this provision will do  more harm than good. I look forward  to debating all of these amendments in  the future.  Let me conclude my remarks on S. 23  by renewing my call to my fellow Senators to carefully consider and support  this legislation. The America Invents  Act  is complicated and  the  subject  matter may seem daunting, but I believe it is critical to protecting American innovation and defending American competitiveness.  The playing field for economic innovation has never been more crowded.  COBURN\u2019S  The United States faces rivals growing  in strength and number, which is why  our government should be encouraging  innovation, not stifling it.  The America Invents Act will create  jobs in Delaware and throughout the  United States by removing some of the  administrative  roadblocks  currently  preventing  inventors  from becoming  successful entrepreneurs. This bill will  improve the speed, quality and reliability of the Patent and Trademark  Office and it will ensure that America  retains its place in the world as the  leader  of  invention  and  innovative  thinking.

            "83": "March 1, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S1041  it is these larger parties that benefit  from this system. In many cases, small  inventors such as start ups and universities simply cannot afford to participate in an interference, and they surrender their rights once a well-funded  party starts such a proceeding.  Mr. Quinn\u2019s article also responded to  critics who allege that the present bill  eliminates the grace period for patent  applications. The grace period is the  one-year period prior to filing when the  inventor may disclose his  invention  without giving up his right to patent.  Mr. Quinn quotes the very language of  this bill, and draws the obvious conclusion:  Regardless of the disinformation that is  widespread,  the currently proposed S.  23  does, in fact, have a grace period. The grace  period would be quite different than what we  have now and would not extend to all third  party activities, but many of the horror stories say that if someone learns of your invention from you and beats you to the Patent  Office, they will get the patent. That is simply flat wrong.  Mr. Quinn is, of course, referring to  the bill\u2019s proposed section 102(b). Under  paragraph (1)(A) of that section, disclosures made by the inventor, or someone who got the information from the  inventor, less than 1 year before the  application  is  filed do not count as  prior art. And under paragraph (1)(B),  during the 1-year period before the application is filed, if the inventor publicly discloses his invention, no subsequently disclosed prior art, regardless  of whether it is derived from the inventor, can count as prior art and invalidate the patent. This effectively creates a \u2018\u2018first to publish\u2019\u2019 rule that protects those  inventors who choose to  disclose their invention. An inventor  who publishes his  invention, or discloses it at a trade show or academic  conference, or otherwise makes it publicly available, has an absolute right to  priority if he files an application within one year of his disclosure. No application effectively filed after his disclosure, and no prior art disclosed after  his disclosure, can defeat his application for patent.  These rules are highly protective of  inventors, especially those who share  their  inventions with the  interested  public but still file a patent application within a year. These rules are also  clear, objective, and transparent. They  create unambiguous guidelines for inventors. An  inventor who wishes to  keep his invention secret must file an  application promptly, before another  person discloses the invention to the  public. And an inventor can also share  his invention with others. If his activities make the invention publicly available, he must file an application within  a year, but his disclosures also prevents any subsequently disclosed prior  art from taking away his right to patent. The bill\u2019s proposed section 102 also  creates clear guidelines for those who  practice in a technology. To figure out  if a patent is valid against prior art, all  that a manufacturer needs to do is look  at the patent\u2019s filing date and figure  out whether the inventor publicly disclosed the invention. If prior art disclosed the invention to the public before the filing date, or if the inventor  disclosed the invention within a year of  filing but the prior art predates that  disclosure, then the  invention  is  invalid. And if not, the patent is valid  against a prior-art challenge.  Some critics of the first-to-file system also argue that it will be expensive  for  inventors  because  they will  be  forced to rush to file a completed application, rather than being able to rely  on their invention date and take their  time to complete an application. These  critics generally ignore the possibility  of  filing  a  provisional  application,  which requires only a written description of the invention and how to make  it. Once a provisional application  is  filed, the inventor has a year to file a  completed application. Currently, filing a provisional application costs $220  for a large entity, and $110 for a small  entity.  One of Mr. Quinn\u2019s earlier columns,  on November 7, 2009, effectively rebuts  the notion that relying on invention  dates offers inventors any substantial  advantage over simply filing a provisional application. As he notes:  If you rely on first to invent and are operating at all responsibly you are keeping an  invention  notebook  that will meet  evidentiary burdens if and when it is neces-  sary to demonstrate conception prior to the  conception of the party who was  first to  file. . . .  [Y]our  invention notebook or  invention  record will detail, describe, identify and date  conception so that others skilled in the art  will be able to look at the notebook/record  and understand what you did, what you  knew, and come to the believe that you did  in fact appreciate what you had. If you have  this, you have provable conception. If you  have provable and identifiable conception,  you also have a disclosure that informs and  supports the invention.  . . . [And] [i]f the  notebook provably demonstrates conception,  then it can be filed as a provisional patent  application at least for the purpose of staking a claim to the conception that is detailed  with enough specificity to later support an  argument in a first to invent regime.  In other words, the showing that an  inventor must make in a provisional  application  is  effectively  the  same  showing that he would have to make to  prove his  invention date under  the  first-to-invent system. A small inventor  operating  under  first-to-invent  rules already must keep independently-  validated notebooks that show when he  conceived of his invention. Under first-  to-file rules, the only additional steps  that the same inventor must take are  writing down the same things that his  notebooks are supposed to prove filing  that writing with the Patent Office,  and paying a $110 fee.  Once the possibility of filing a provisional application is considered, along  with this bill\u2019s enhanced grace period,  it should be clear that the first-to-file  system will not be at all onerous for  small  inventors. And once one considers the bill\u2019s clean, clear rules for  prior art and priority dates, its elimination of subjective elements in patent  law, its new proceeding to correct patents, and  its elimination of current  patent-forfeiture pitfalls that trap legally unwary inventors, it is clear that  this bill will benefit  inventors both  large and small.  Allow me to also take a moment to  briefly describe the concerns that Senators Feingold and COBURNand I raised  in our 2009 Minority Report, and how  the present bill addresses those concerns.  Senators Feingold and COBURNand I  proposed that the bill impose a higher  threshold showing  for  instituting an  inter partes, or post-grant review. This  had long been a top priority for the  Patent Office, both under the previous  administration and under the current  one. The Patent Office made clear that  a higher threshold is necessary to weed  out marginal challenges and preserve  the office\u2019s own resources, and that a  higher threshold would also force parties to front-load their cases, allowing  these proceedings to be resolved more  quickly. The present bill imposes higher thresholds, requiring a reasonable  likelihood of invalidity for inter partes  review, and more-likely-than-not invalidity for post-grant review.  Senators Feingold and COBURNand I  also recommended that the Patent Office be allowed to operate inter partes  reexamination as an adjudicative proceeding, where the burden of proof is  on the challenger and the office simply  decides whether the challenger has met  his burden. The present bill makes this  change,  repealing  requirements  that  inter  partes  be  run  on  an  examinational model and allowing the  PTO to adopt an adjudicative model.  The 2009 Minority Report also recommended that the bill restrict serial  administrative challenges to patents  and require coordination of these proceedings with litigation. We also called  for limiting use of ex parte reexamination to patent owners, noting that allowing three different avenues for administrative attack on patents invites  serial challenges. The present bill does  coordinate inter partes and post-grant  review with litigation, barring use of  these  proceedings  if  the  challenger  seeks a declaratory judgment that a  patent is invalid, and setting a time  limit for seeking inter partes review if  the petitioner or related parties is sued  for  infringement of the patent. The  present bill does not, however, bar the  use of ex parte reexamination by third  parties. The Patent Office and others  persuaded me that these proceedings  operate reasonably well in most cases  and are not an undue burden on patent  owners. The present bill does, however,  impose limits on serial challenges that  will also restrict the use of ex parte reexamination. The bill\u2019s enhanced administrative estoppel will effectively  bar a third party or related parties  from invoking ex parte reexamination  against a patent if that third party has  already employed post-grant or inter  partes  review  against  that  patent.

            "91": "March 1, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S1049  I  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President,  suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.  The  Senator  does  not  have  enough time under her control to suggest the absence of a quorum.  The Senator from Louisiana.  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise  in strong support of the Toomey-Vitter  amendment, which we will vote on in  the series of two votes starting at 5  p.m. The  idea behind  the Toomey-  Vitter amendment is very simple. It  says if we ever reach the debt ceiling,  the government, as a top first priority,  will use revenue to pay two things:  first, proper interest payments on our  U.S. Government debt; and secondly,  Social Security checks to seniors.  The motivation behind this amendment is simple. First, those two things  should be legitimately a top priority.  No one should want the U.S. Government to default on its debt and no one  should want the immediate stoppage,  or the stoppage at any time, of Social  Security checks to seniors. So first, it  is legitimate to rank those two functions as an absolute top priority.  The second motivation behind this  amendment is to take some of these  scare tactics and hysteria out of this  debate. Too many people, in my opinion, have been saying if we ever reach  the debt ceiling, the next day all Social  Security checks will stop and all payments will  stop  on U.S. Treasury  bills\u2014on government debt. That is not  true. There is no reason it has to be  true. This amendment, when passed  into law, will ensure it is not true. It  will ensure we look at this situation  with  focus  and  calmness  and  not  hysteria and scare tactics.  The goal, I am certain\u2014and I know it  is  for Senator TOOMEY, my  distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania\u2014  is not that we not default on our debt  and not that we reach the debt ceiling,  but it is that we take strong, responsible action well ahead of any threatened event to put us on a fiscally sustainable path.  Just  this morning,  both Senator  TOOMEYand I were in a hearing of the  Senate Banking Committee and  the  witness\u2014the  only witness\u2014was Ben  Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve. He  said very clearly  several  things directly  pertinent  to  this  discussion.  First, he said we are on a  fiscally  unsustainable path. Our budget situation is absolutely unsustainable. Second, he said that is the biggest long-  term threat to our economy\u2014the biggest threat. Third, he said that although it is a long-term problem, it  could create a  short-term crisis.  It  could create a crisis that could hit immediately, at any time. So we need to  act and we need to act strongly.  Madam President, I yield time to the  distinguished Senator  from Pennsylvania.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the Senator\u2019s request for unanimous consent  to make a unanimous consent request?  Mr. VITTER. I object.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.  Mrs. BOXER.  I want  an  answer,  please, to my question: Can people object to a unanimous consent request  without saying who they are, No. 1?  And No. 2, what is the parliamentary  procedure here?  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana objected to the unanimous consent request on behalf of the Senator from  Oklahoma, Senator COBURN. The Senator from Louisiana objected to the extension of the unanimous consent request for additional time on his own  behalf.  Mrs. BOXER. So it is the Senator  from Oklahoma, Senator COBURN, who  objects to the bill we have that would  say we don\u2019t get paid in the case of a  shutdown;  is  that  correct? Senator  COBURNis objecting to that?  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.  That  is  the  Chair\u2019s  understanding.  All time remaining is under control  of the minority.  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I  wish  to  thank Senator VITTER for  yielding his time and for his help on  this effort. I want to be very clear.  First, I am not aware of anybody in  this body or anybody I know who wants  to see a government shutdown. I am  not aware of anybody who wants to see  the disruption that would result from  failing to raise the debt ceiling at the  appropriate  time.  But  I  also  feel  strongly it is critical we take this opportunity to begin to address the structural problems we have.  The fact is we have a burden of debt  right now that is costing us jobs in this  country today. The uncertainty it creates, the cost of  financing this, the  question of whether and for how long  we can roll this over, the extent to  which inflation becomes a problem, all  of these risk factors are already weighing on our economy and our ability to  create jobs now. For the future, it is an  even bigger risk.  Senator VITTERand I have taken this  step so we can have an honest discussion about how we are going to bring  this spending under control and the  process reforms we are going to make  so we  can  hopefully  get  off  this  unsustainable path and get on a sustainable trajectory  for the economic  growth we need. That  is ultimately  what this measure is all about. It simply says that in the event we reach the  debt  limit without having  raised  it  first\u2014and let\u2019s face it, we have been  there before. This has happened in the  past. In the last 20 years, it has happened on several occasions. So it is entirely possible that, despite the best efforts of those of us who want to avoid  it, it could happen again.  If it were to happen again, we want  to make sure that we have no default  on our debt, that interest is paid, and  that Social Security checks go to the  recipients as they should. There will be  plenty of resources from ongoing tax  revenue to make sure that happens,  and anything less would be very irresponsible.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of this amendment.  DAMAGESLANGUAGE  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President,  I commend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his hard work in  putting  together  this  managers\u2019  amendment and building consensus for  this bill. Part of the managers\u2019 amendment strikes most of section 4 of the  bill, relating to damages. As the chairman knows, I worked very hard on the  \u2018\u2018gatekeeper\u2019\u2019 damages language in this  section of the bill. That language represented a compromise between high-  technology companies, many located in  my State of California, which believed  that the law relating to patent damages needed reform, and other interests,  including universities, biotech,  pharmaceutical companies, and small  inventors, who were greatly concerned  that the preferred solution of the high-  technology companies, namely apportionment of damages, would be destructive to the value of patents. However, since then, the courts have further developed the law relating to damages, so I understand that the chairman proposes to now strike the gatekeeper damages language from the bill.  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, the Senator is correct. I thank her for her hard work in  putting together the gatekeeper damages  language with Senator Specter  and myself in committee last Congress.  It was instrumental in helping to move  this bill forward. However, as the Senator  from California  recognizes,  the  courts have advanced the law regarding  damages since then. For example, in  Uniloc USA, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., decided just this year, the Federal Circuit held that expert testimony regarding a \u2018\u2018rule of thumb\u2019\u2019 for allocating  profits between a patent user and a  patent owner did not meet the Daubert  test for expert testimony, and was inadmissible.

I  look forward to future generations having the opportunity to enjoy Marin  County\u2019s  rich  agricultural  tradition  and natural beauty.\u2211  f  REMEMBERING FRED HILL  \u2211Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take  this opportunity to honor the memory  of  a  very  special man, Frederick  \u2018\u2018Fred\u2019\u2019 Hill of Sonoma County, who  died on February 9, 2011. He was 75  years old.  Fred Hill was a man of many talents  and will be fondly remembered for his  diverse work  in  the  literary world.  Born in Philadelphia, PA, Fred went on  to attend Brown University. Following  graduation, Fred served in the Army  before getting a  job as a travelling  textbook  salesman with Knopf. He  later worked  for Little, Brown as a  Western States salesman and then as  head of the company\u2019s international division. Throughout this transformative  time of travel and networking, Fred realized his gift: he  loved writers, he  loved publishers, and he was uniquely  gifted in his ability to interact with  and explain one to the other.  Fred relocated to the San Francisco  Bay area in the late 1970s. In 1979, after  5 years as general manager at Sierra  Club Books, he rented an office on  Union Street and opened his own agency, which is now run by his business  partner, Bonnie Nadell. Fred remained  on Union Street, in one office or another, until he decided to move his  business to Glen Ellen, where he resided with his partner, Peter Gilliam.  The job of a literary agent is all encompassing, as their success depends  on their client\u2019s success. Authors bestow a great deal of trust to their  agents, and  I know personally  that  Fred Hill was an outstanding agent. He  was able to be encouraging and yet be  critical where warranted.  Fred worked diligently to advance  the products and interests of his clients, and could always be counted on  to excite virtually anyone about a client\u2019s book. Fred\u2019s clients ranged from  best-selling  novelist Richard North  Patterson to nonfiction writer Michael  Murphy. He also worked with an extensive  list  of  food writers,  including  Carol  Field,  Hubert  Keller,  David  Lebovitz, and Gerald Hirigoyen.  Those who knew Fred Hill recognized  him as a uniquely innovative and brilliant man. His work  in the  literary  world will be remembered fondly by all  those whose lives he touched. He will  be deeply missed.  Fred is survived by his partner of 31  years, Peter Gilliam.\u2211  f  TRIBUTE TO SUE ROUST  \u2211Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr.  President, today I recognize a devoted  and dedicated public servant  in my  home State  of South Dakota. Sue  Roust has served as Minnehaha County  auditor for five terms and is retiring.  During her tenure of public service in  Minnehaha County, the number of registered voters in the county has grown  from 75,000 to over 108,000. She has effectively managed 24 county elections  as well as Sioux Falls city and school  elections. In total, she has overseen the  counting of over 1.3 million ballots.  Additionally, Sue manages the accounting functions for the county. During her 20 years of service, the county  budget has quadrupled. She has provided oversight and counsel on a number of important issues impacting the  county. She has also utilized her position as county auditor to educate the  general public on numerous issues. She  has maintained a high level of professionalism and commitment to community service during her two decades of  service.  In addition to her elected service,  Sue has served in various leadership  capacities for many community organizations,  including  the PTA, Boy  Scouts, Girl Scouts, United Way, the  Sioux Falls Washington High School  Booster Club, the Dow Rummel Village  board of trustees, the Sioux Falls Business and Professional Women, and the  First Congregational Church. She currently  serves  on  the  board  of  Here4Youth,  an  organization which  provides day  care and out-of-school  care to children ages 3\u201321 with a special  emphasis  on  children with  special  needs.  I commend Sue for her great dedication and commitment to the people of  Minnehaha County and the State of  South Dakota. She  can  take great  pride in her service. I want to wish Sue  and her family all the best in retirement and good luck in all future endeavors.\u2211  f  TRIBUTE TO THE DOLAN-JUSTICE  FAMILY  \u2211Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr.  President, today I wish to pay tribute  to  the Dolan-Justice  family on  the  100th anniversary of owning the Grant  County Review of Milbank, SD. This  occasion highlights the Dolan-Justice  family commitment to the newspaper  industry and to the Grant County community.  On February 11, 1911, 24-year-old William S. Dolan  acquired  the Grant  County Review. This started a 46-year  adventure as editor of the small town  weekly newspaper. In a time with virtually no access to television or radio,  the  local  newspaper was  the  only  source of news for small town South  Dakota. With no experience  in news  media, William quickly  learned  the  ropes. The Grant County Review became a family affair. William\u2019s wife,  Christine Olson, was a trusted adviser  to the paper, and his sister-in-law, Victoria Olson, even set the type on the  linograph machine  by  hand. While  other surrounding newspapers  folded,  William\u2019s accounting background and  hard work enabled the Grant County  Review to continue through the 20th  century. A fierce rivalry began between  the Grant County Review and the Herald Review, pitting each paper against  each other for advertisers and breaking  news stories. Often Dolan and the editor of the Herald Review would trade  blows in the editorial section of their  papers.  Sticking with the  family tradition  for  journalism, William\u2019s  daughter  Phyllis pursued a journalism degree at  South Dakota State University and the  University  of Minnesota. She  then  came back to write for the paper and  help her father run the day-to-day activities. The family paper soon hired a  printer,  Clarence  Justice.  Clarence  worked for many papers before coming  to the Grant County Review, including  the Miller Gazette,  the  Interlakes  Daily, and the Miller Press. After William S. Dolan passed away, his family  took over operation of the Grant County Review, with his wife Christine  served as the new publisher, and his  daughter Phyllis as the new editor.  William always fought for small business and rural farmers, and served as  the president for the Board of Regents,  overseeing South Dakota\u2019s public universities. In 1962, William S. Dolan was  elected to the South Dakota Newspaper  Hall of Fame.  In  1982, Phyllis was  elected as the first female president of  the South Dakota Press Association,  and in 1988 she joined her father in the  South Dakota Newspaper Hall of Fame.  Phyllis\u2019  boundary  breaking  honors  serve as an inspiration to women in  journalism. Clarence and Phyllis both  received distinguished service awards  for their work in journalism for the  South Dakota Newspaper Association.  In 1997, the Grant County Review received the distinguished Bishop Dudley  award from the Diocese of Sioux Falls,  for Clarence and Phyllis\u2019 dedication to  integrity  and  religious  values. The  Grant County Review has the largest  readership of any weekly newspaper in  the State. This achievement highlights  the incredible devotion this family and  the paper\u2019s employees have to the responsibility of disseminating the news.  I am proud to honor the Dolan-Justice  family on reaching this hallmark, and  on being reliable, responsible members  of the journalism community.\u2211  f  MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE  At 10:40 a.m., a message  from the  House of Representatives, delivered by  Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that that House has passed the  following bills, in which it requests the  concurrence of the Senate:  H.R. 347.

ED WHITFIELD  OFKENTUCKY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2011  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to speak about  legislation  I have  introduced  that will reinforce our Nation\u2019s commitment to  combating prescription drug abuse by  reauthorizing the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act, NASPER,  for  three additional years.  On August 11, 2005, NASPER was signed  into law to assist States in combating prescription drug abuse of  controlled  substances,  through  prescription  drug monitoring  programs, PDMPs. NASPER is administered by  the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, and provides grants to States to  establish and improve prescription drug monitoring programs.  Just last week, the head of the Office of National  Drug  Control  Policy, ONDCP, Gil  Kerlikowske, embarked on a three-day visit to  Kentucky where he saw firsthand the significant problems with prescription pill abuse, an  issue many in my district struggle with. It\u2019s estimated that 82 Kentuckians die each month  as a  result of overdoses. Nationwide  there  were more than 27,000 deaths from prescription drug overdoses in 2007, a number that  has risen five-fold since 1990. These statistics  are unacceptable and a testament that more  must be done.  While Kentucky has made great  strides  through its PDMP and collaboration between  the public and private sector, illicit drugs continue to flow across our borders from States  without  PDMPs,  such  as  Florida.  Last  Wednesday, law enforcement officials from the  U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA,  conducted a massive raid in South Florida arresting 20, including five doctors, after a yearlong investigation involving trafficking of prescription pills. What\u2019s more concerning is the  recent decision by the Governor of Florida to  repeal funding for the creation of a PDMP approved by the State legislature in 2009.  By reauthorizing the NASPER program we  will ensure States have the support they need  to address prescription drug abuse by making  NASPER grants available  for planning purposes as well as for \u2018\u2018establishing, improving,  and maintaining\u2019\u2019  their  programs.  Through  these grants, States will be given resources to  help prevent patients  from doctor shopping  and abusing prescription drugs. This also will  help to ensure that appropriate law enforcement, regulatory and State professional licensing authorities have access to prescription history  information  for  the purposes of  investigating drug diversion and errant prescriber/  pharmacist prescribing and dispensing practices.  I urge my colleagues  to  join me  in supporting  this vital piece of  legislation and  to  push for swift passage in the House.  f  INDIAN AMERICAN CULTURAL  CENTER 9TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2011  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure  to announce  that  the  Indian  American Cultural Center of NWIHRC will be  celebrating  its 9th anniversary by hosting a  gala dinner and banquet on Saturday, March  5, 2011, at  the Halls of Saint George,  in  Schererville, Indiana.  The Indian American Cultural Center, which  opened on March 9, 2002, was established  with the following goal in mind: to foster peace  and harmony amongst  the people of Northwest Indiana by showcasing their cultural heritage and creating spiritual awareness in both  youth and adults, as well as to engage in various charitable events, both nationally and locally. Since its inception, the Indian American  Cultural Center has been instrumental in educating Northwest Indiana\u2019s citizens on the traditions and customs of the Indian heritage.  The members of the Indian American Cultural Center of NWIHRC are  to be  commended, not only for their commitment to preserving tradition, but also for their commitment  to making improvements that benefit all mankind. Proceeds  from  this year\u2019s gala, which  throughout  the years has demonstrated  the  immense generosity of its attendees and organizers, will go to support the Carmelite Home  for Girls. In the past, proceeds from the gala  have gone to such noble causes as cancer research, educational scholarships,  the American Red Cross, and tsunami relief, as well as  to victims of Hurricane Katrina and the earthquake in Kashmir, India.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other  distinguished  colleagues  join me  in  commending the board and members of the Indian  American Cultural Center of NWIHRC for their  outstanding  contributions  to  society.  Their  commitment to improving the quality of life for  the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the world is truly inspirational and should  be recognized and commended.  f  HONORING TERRELL LIONS CLUB  HON. JEB HENSARLING  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2011  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to recognize the outstanding service that the  Terrell Lions Club provides the communities in  Kaufman County, Texas.  Lions Club  International was  founded  in  1917 in Chicago to aid the blind and visually  impaired. The Terrell Lions Club was founded  on February 28, 1921 and was one of the first  chartered in Texas.  Since that time, the Terrell Lions Club created the Lions Club Park in 1948 on sixteen  acres of land for the National Guard Armory,  as well as two community tennis courts.  The Terrell Lions work  to eradicate blindness by providing free vision screenings, eye  examinations and glasses  for  the needy, as  well as promoting the Lions Eye Bank.  Lions contribute time, talent and resources  to  the Texas Lions Club Camp  in Kerrville,  which provides free residential camping experiences  for children with physical disabilities,  Type 1 diabetes and cancer.  This organization provides an  invaluable  service to those in the community who truly  need assistance. Over the years, thousands of  individuals and families have been blessed by  the men and women of the Terrell Lions Club.  As the Congressman for the Fifth District of  Texas, I am pleased today to recognize the  Terrell Lions Club for their 90 years of service  to Kaufman County. To all  the men and  women who give of their time and efforts so  generously, on behalf of all the constituents of  the Fifth District,  I would  like  to extend our  most sincere gratitude.  f  HONORING ITASCA FIRE CHIEF  JAMES D. MACARTHUR  HON. PETER J. ROSKAM  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2011  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to  rise today in recognition of the long and distinguished service of James D. MacArthur on the  occasion of his retirement. On March 31st of  this year, Mr. MacArthur will conclude his loyal  service as Fire Chief of the Itasca Fire Protection District.  Chief MacArthur has served the community  for a total of 38 years, including 8 years as  Fire Chief of the Itasca Fire Protection District  No. 1 and 15 years as Fire Chief of the Elk  Grove Village Fire Department.  Throughout  his  career,  his  extraordinary  leadership  has  earned  him  great  respect  among colleagues and members of the community. He has held many noteworthy positions,  including President of  the  Illinois Fire  Chiefs Association and the Metropolitan Fire  Chiefs Association. Along with other members  of  the  Illinois  fire service  task  force, Chief  MacArthur assisted in the Louisiana response  and relief efforts following Hurricane Katrina.  Time and time again, Chief MacArthur has  exhibited  the characteristics  this  line of duty  necessitates: enormous sacrifice and courage.  Mr. Speaker and distinguished colleagues,  please join me in celebrating this special occasion and wishing him every happiness in the  well deserved respite of his retirement.

PART 1\u2014Extension of Rights and Protections Relating to Veterans\u2019 Preference Under  Title 5, United States Code, to Covered Employees of the Legislative Branch (section  4(c) of the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998)  Subpart A\u2014Matters of General Applicability  to All Regulations Promulgated under Section 4 of the VEOA  Sec.  1.101Purpose and scope.  1.102Definitions.  1.103Adoption of regulations.  1.104Coordination with section 225 of the  Congressional  Accountability  Act.  SEC. 1.101. PURPOSE AND SCOPE.  (a) Section 4(c) of the VEOA. The Veterans  Employment  Opportunities  Act  of  1998  (VEOA) applies the rights and protections of  sections 2108, 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I of chapter 35 of title 5 U.S.C., to  certain covered employees within the Legislative branch.  (b) Purpose of regulations. The regulations  set forth herein are the substantive regulations that the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance has promulgated pursuant  to section 4(c)(4) of the VEOA, in accordance  with the rulemaking procedure set forth in  section 304 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. \u00a71384). The  purpose of subparts B, C and D of these regulations is to define veterans\u2019 preference and  the administration of veterans\u2019 preference as  applicable to Federal employment  in the  Legislative branch. (5 U.S.C. \u00a72108, as applied  by the VEOA). The purpose of subpart E of  these regulations is to ensure that the principles of the veterans\u2019 preference laws are integrated into the existing employment and  retention policies and processes of those employing offices with employees covered by  the VEOA, and to provide for transparency  in the application of veterans\u2019 preference in  covered  appointment  and  retention  decisions. Provided, nothing in these regulations  shall be construed so as to require an employing office to reduce any existing veterans\u2019 preference rights and protections that  it may afford to preference eligible individuals.  H Regs: (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \u2018\u2018covered employee\u2019\u2019 in Section 4(c)  of the VEOA limits the scope of the statute\u2019s  applicability within the Legislative branch.  The term \u2018\u2018covered employee\u2019\u2019 excludes any  employee: (1) whose appointment is made by  the President with the advice and consent of  the Senate; (2) whose appointment is made  by a Member of Congress within an employing office, as defined by Sec. 101(9)(A\u2013C) of  the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \u00a71301(9)(A\u2013C); (3) whose appointment is made by a committee or subcommittee of either House of Congress or a  joint committee of the House of Representatives and the Senate; or (4) who is appointed  to a position, the duties of which are equivalent to those of a Senior Executive Service  position  (within  the meaning  of  section  3132(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code). Accordingly, these regulations shall not apply  to any employing office that only employs  individuals excluded from the definition of  covered employee.  S Regs: (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \u2018\u2018covered employee\u2019\u2019 in Section 4(c)  of the VEOA limits the scope of the statute\u2019s  applicability within the Legislative branch.  The term \u2018\u2018covered employee\u2019\u2019 excludes any  employee: (1) whose appointment is made by  the President with the advice and consent of  the Senate; (2) whose appointment is made  or directed by a Member of Congress within  an  employing office, as defined by Sec.  101(9)(A\u2013C) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \u00a71301(9)(A\u2013C);  (3) whose appointment is made by a committee or subcommittee of either House of  Congress or a joint committee of the House  of Representatives and the Senate; (4) who is  appointed pursuant to section 105(a) of the  Second Supplemental Appropriations Act,  1978; or (5) who is appointed to a position, the  duties of which are equivalent to those of a  Senior Executive Service position  (within  the meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of title 5,  United States Code).

            "44": "S1338  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE March 8, 2011  the alternative CBO scenario and what  they deem most likely to occur without our action\u2014we would spend $7.63  trillion less than we are now spending.  This is how it would work. There is a  formula in here.  This is a 10-page bill. There are not a  lot of \u2018\u2018whereases\u2019\u2019 in this bill. It is just  a business document, something the  former Governor from New Hampshire  might be accustomed to looking at. It  is a business document that puts in  place statutory limits that are formula  driven to take us from here to there.  If we don\u2019t meet those requirements,  then after 45 days\u2014and there are targets each year of spending relative to  our economy. By the way, this joins everybody at  the hip  in wanting our  economy to grow because if our economy grows rapidly, those targets are  much easier to hit. But  if Congress  doesn\u2019t act, if we don\u2019t have the courage to act, then there would be automatic  sequestration  on  a  pro  rata  basis, depending on the enumerator,  what the size of that particular budget  appropriation is relative to the overall  budget. So on a pro rata basis, we  would have sequestration that would  take out those monies.  Now, none of us wants to see that  happen, so that would force us to actually do what any Congress acting responsibly needs to do; that is, to actually work together each year to meet  those requirements.  I have heard  so many people  recently, especially on the other side of  the aisle, talking about  focusing on  discretionary spending only, basically  cutting out some of those things that  might make  our  country  stronger.  There are some things certainly in all  of these bills, as the Senator from Nebraska was mentioning, where I might  have differing priorities. But the fact  is, when we try to do it all only on discretionary spending, we are not only  not solving the problem but it prevents  us from actually looking at some aspects that might otherwise make our  economy grow.  Again, this bill, the CAP Act\u2014with  signed on as an  original cosponsor with me, and others  are looking at it\u2014would cause us to  look at everything. So, again, first, a  comprehensive  look at spending relative to our economy at historical levels. Everything is on the table and on  budget.  Sequestration would  be  in  place, and it would take a two-thirds  vote  of Congress  to  override  these  spending limits.  Again, I did not come here to message. I didn\u2019t come to move the bar beyond what the other side might be  doing just to make a name for myself  or create publicity. I came to solve our  country\u2019s problems.  I  look at these  young people in front of me, and I don\u2019t  think they have any idea what our irresponsibility  is doing to them. We  talk about  future generations, but I  think all of us know we are actually at  a point now where we have been so irresponsible that this is not just going  CLAIREMCCASKILL to affect future generations, it is getting ready to affect us.  There is a lot of turmoil in this world  today. For  that  reason,  the United  States has been perceived as a safe  haven. Our interest rates continue to  be  low because of  the  rest of  the  world\u2019s turmoil. The  fact  is,  if and  when\u2014and we hope that when is soon\u2014  everything  settles  down,  as  people  begin to again look closely at where we  are as a country, and if we continue to  not act responsibly and show the world  we have the ability to at least put in  place this framework that causes us to  work together and get to the place we  all know we need to get, then I fear interest rates, over time, are going to  run from us, and that interest relative  to our debt payments is going to continually consume more.  In closing, Madam President\u2014and I  appreciate  the  time\u2014I  have  gone  around the State of Tennessee and conducted 43 townhall meetings talking  about this type of approach. I know  numbers of Members on the other side  of the aisle have talked about what  they believe is an appropriate level of  spending  relative  to  our  country\u2019s  economy. I believe this bill is not out  of line. I know this bill is at least appropriate. There are a number of people  who think it should be lower, but this  is something that would cause us to  first agree on where we are going.  It is difficult for a body such as this,  with 100 Senators and 435 House Members on the other side, to agree on little matters when we don\u2019t have any  idea where it is we are trying to go.  This would create a target for us. It  would create a straitjacket  for Congress. It would cause us to prioritize.  So I am going to continue talking  about this until, hopefully, we pass it  and actually have a process that causes  us to work together in a constructive  way.  With that, I yield the floor, and I  thank the Chair for the time.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.  f  GASOLINE PRICES  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise  to focus on another grave threat to our  economic  recovery  and  jobs:  skyrocketing energy prices, and particularly the price of gasoline at the pump.  Madam President,  I don\u2019t have to  point out to Americans all over the  country, and Louisianans all over my  State, because they see it in front of  them every time they go get a new  tank of gas, the ever-increasing energy  prices, the ever-increasing prices at the  pump. Right now, on average, nationwide, the price at the pump is $3.51 a  gallon. That is about 80 cents higher  than the average price a year ago. Most  Americans know  it  is not  stopping  there. They  see  $4 gasoline coming  sooner  rather  than  later,  and who  knows how far it will go beyond $4 at  the pump?  This is a real threat. We are trying to  come out of the worst recession since  the Great Depression and this is an immediate threat to put the brakes on  any recovery we may be mounting, and  it is surely a real threat and a real hit  to Louisiana and American families. It  is a direct hit to their pocketbooks.  Louisianans, like all Americans, hear  talking heads on TV, national economists, saying we don\u2019t have any real  inflation. Listen, they are hit every  time they go to the pump. They know  there is inflation in key prices such as  gasoline, and that is a big hit to their  family budget.  This has  sparked  somewhat  of  a  breakthrough in thinking among the  ranks of the Obama administration.  Let me explain what I mean by that.  Recently President Obama\u2019s Energy  Secretary, Secretary Chu, focused on  supply and he said we need to increase  supply to temper prices and mitigate  the increasing price at the pump. He  said we need to do this by convincing  the Saudi Arabians to increase their  supply of oil on the world market:  \u2018\u2018That\u2019s going to mitigate the price increase.\u2019\u2019 He said further, \u2018\u2018We\u2019re hoping  market forces will take care of this.\u2019\u2019 I  at least give Secretary Chu and the  Obama administration marks for this  breakthrough understanding that supply is a big part of the equation. In  fact, it is half of the supply and demand equation that yields price.  Recently the White House Chief of  Staff Bill Daley made a comment that  also went to supply. He said this weekend, on  some of  the weekend  talk  shows, that we need to consider opening the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to  put more product on the market, to increase supply\u2014also to temper prices, to  stop  these  ever-increasing  prices.  Again, I at least give Mr. Daley and the  Obama administration credit  for  finally realizing, and  it  is a bit of a  breakthrough, that supply is a big part  of the issue.  Where I disagree, where I want a further breakthrough, is that they need to  focus on domestic supply we can create  and that we can control in America.  Unfortunately, they are not doing that  yet.  I have come to the floor many times  to talk about the virtual shutdown of  the Gulf of Mexico to energy production since the BP disaster. I will mention that again because that is at the  heart of this issue. The administration  understands we need to increase supply. What about domestic supply? What  about the Gulf of Mexico? What about  all of our other vast energy resources  that we are taking off the table and  shutting down? What about that supply? That is the first place we should  turn, that is the first action we should  take. That is what can help us control  our own destiny.  Instead,  there has been a virtual  shutdown of the Gulf of Mexico to energy production. That has reduced direct and indirect employment in the  oil and gas and service industries. It  threatens  93,000  jobs  for every year  until 2035 unless we reverse it.

            "52": "S1346  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE March 8, 2011  of the Interstate Highway System, not  to mention billions of dollars\u2019 worth of  spinoff jobs and tax revenues to our  communities. We are still  living off  that inheritance. We are living off the  infrastructure  investments  of  those  who went before us.  Today, China is investing 9 percent of  its GDP into infrastructure. Europe is  investing 5 percent of its GDP into infrastructure. The United States, just  about 2 percent, slightly less. We have  a $2.2 trillion infrastructure deficit.  What we have not been discussing in  this debate is what we need to invest  in, a coherent strategy, a policy to  make certain we are not held hostage  to oil and  instability  in the Middle  East.  The United States could become the  first country to have 1 million electric  vehicles on the road by 2015 and ensure  that 80 percent of our electricity comes  from clean energy sources and with  that comes jobs. We need a cutting-  edge, high-speed wireless data network.  We still do not have one. We are going  backward. We  invented  the  technologies. We used to be No. 3 or No. 4.  Now we are drifting back to No. 16 or  No. 21, depending on whose measurement we look at. By any measurement  and any standard, we are going backward, while other countries are going  forward, and it is because we are not  investing and making it attractive for  the private sector or private citizens to  achieve this.  America has always been a competitive country. Our DNA is innovation  and creativity and entrepreneurial activity. The fact is, we are not doing the  things we could do  in  joint venture  with the private sector to attract the  best jobs and create the best opportunities. We have to become that nation  again. That is what our budget ought  to be discussing, and we ought to be  able to agree across party lines as to  how we do that.  The budget passed by the House of  Representatives  not  only  does  not  present a realistic set of choices with  respect to how we make America competitive and create higher paying jobs  and grow our economy, not only does it  not do that, it actually strips away the  opportunities to do that. It takes us  backward.  The House budget is going to lower  the deficit by only 6 percent because  they are focused only on domestic discretionary spending. They do not focus  on defense spending. They do not focus  on Medicaid, Medicare, entitlements.  They do not focus on some of the waste  and  duplication within  the  system.  They just strip away at a whole bunch  of programs that many of them have  opposed for their entire life in politics  and voted against in the first place.  They are using the opportunity of this  budget to press an ideological agenda.  That  is why only 13 percent of the  budget is being focused on in what they  are doing.  They have sworn off any discussion  of the very hard choices. Here we are 3  months after the Commission put forward its important proposals, and the  Senate is trapped in a political moment when what we need is a moment  of truth.  We have to find a way to make these  tougher choices.  I wish to be clear  about what I think they are. I ask my  colleagues: Do we want a government  that is too limited to have invented the  Internet? A lot of people do not think  about that, but the fact is, the government invented the Internet. It was a  spinoff  from DARPA,  from  research  into how we might be able to communicate in the case of nuclear war. We  were  creating  this  communications  network which became the Internet.  Then the private sector saw the opportunities and took those opportunities  and translated them into what we have  today, which has  revolutionized  the  way people communicate and do business. But  it came  from the government, just as digitalization came from  government research, the space program, which also produced Gortex and  microwave and Teflon and a host of  other products that are now out in the  marketplace where we have created  millions of jobs. The Internet created  more than a million jobs and has added  greatly to the gross domestic product  of our country.  We want to have a country that is so  limited that we do not do those kinds  of things? Taxes so low that everybody  feels good, thinks they are better off,  but we do not do the research that is  necessary to create jobs and new industries and fill the Treasury with the revenue that educates our children, cures  to diseases and provides opportunities  for poor people to break out of poverty  and touch the brass ring of America.  We have to get past the slogans and  the sound bites. We have to reason together and talk about the things America does best.  If we are going to balance the budget  and create jobs, we cannot pretend we  are going to do it by eliminating earmarks and government waste. We have  to look at how we did it previously.  In the early 1990s, our economy was  faltering because deficits were too big  and debt was freezing capital. We had  to send a signal to the market that we  were capable of being fiscally responsible. Guess what. We did it, and we did  it without a  reckless assault on a  whole series of things that make a difference to the quality of life of our  country and to our ability to create  jobs. We saw our economy turn around  in the 1990s, and we created 22 million  jobs. We created unprecedented wealth  in America. Every single income level  in our country saw their income go up  in the 1990s. We created more wealth in  the 1990s than we created in the 1920s  and  1930s with  the great barons of  wealth of that period\u2014the Carnegies,  Mellons, and so  forth. We did  it by  committing  the  country  to  a  disciplined path, where we spoke to the  potential of the American people.  Working with  the Republicans\u2014it  was bipartisan\u2014we came up with a  framework that put our country on a  track to be debt free by 2012, for the  first time since Andrew Jackson\u2019s administration. The fact is, Alan Greenspan was warning America and  the  Senate that we were paying down our  debt too fast and that could have implications on the marketplace.  We know how to do this in a responsible way. How we got off track from  that is a story I am not going to go  back into right now. It is pretty well  known. But the truth of how we generated the 1990s economic boom is a  story that has to be retold again and  again.  Let me point out the difference. We  are not going to do this process in 2  weeks. We know that. We ought to  have a responsible CR that allows us to  go forward and give ourselves a proper  amount of time to tackle these larger  issues and put something serious on  the table with tax reform spending, entitlements\u2014all  those  issues  on  the  table.  What we have in this House budget\u2014  let me point out, rather than say it  takes us backward. I believe there are  reckless cuts in this budget that would  do great harm to our country because  it strips away our ability to create the  future. Research and development in  technology, research and development  in science, the National Institutes of  Health\u2014a host of these things are cut  in a draconian way.  I had lunch the other day with the  Secretary of the Navy. He was telling  me how  the House budget has cut  ARPA\u2013E program. It has cut it from  about $250 million down to $50 million.  The House bill effectively shuts off all  the projects.  Do you know what some of those  projects are? One is our military\u2019s ability to have greater capacity  in the  field, to have solar or wind or battery  storage so they do not have to run convoys of fuel to keep vehicles and supply  our troops with the administrative support they need.  They say the military has done a  study. For every 24 convoys for fuel, we  lose one marine or soldier\u2014one marine  or soldier for every 24 convoys. They  are looking at ways to reduce having  those convoys, and they are cutting  the money so our military will be more  dependent on the fossil fuel that comes  from  unstable  countries  in  various  parts of the world.

Mr. President, China is  racing ahead with  respect  to  these  kinds of investments.

            "60": "S1354  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE March 8, 2011  disrupted  if  the  Republican-passed  budget, H.R. 1, were to become law.  Our challenge, as President Obama  said in the State of the Union Address,  is  that  we  have  to  outeducate,  outinnovate, and outbuild our competitors so that America will be able to  compete in the 21st century globally.  That is our challenge. H.R. 1, the Republican budget, doesn\u2019t allow us to do  that. There is a better way of doing it,  and, as the President said, we need to  do it in a fiscally responsible way. How  do we do that?  We need a credible plan to balance  the Federal budget\u2014a credible plan  that will bring in more deficit reduction than H.R. 1, the Republican budget, because you need to allow America  to grow, yet move toward a balanced  budget. The only way is to include all  sectors, not just discretionary domestic spending. You need to include military spending, you need to deal with  entitlements, and you need  to deal  with  revenues.  President  Obama\u2019s  budget starts us down that path by  freezing discretionary domestic spending over 5 years. We have already gone  further than that  in the continuing  resolution we have  passed. We  are  going to go back to 2010 numbers or  even below that.  We have already put on the table dramatic reductions in the growth rate of  discretionary domestic spending, but  we need to include defense. Iraq and Afghanistan need to come to an end;  those savings will be dramatic. America cannot continue to have a growth  economy where we spend so much more  than any other nation on our national  defense. We have to protect the people  in this Nation, but we cannot take on  the burdens of the world. There have to  be adequate burdens among our allies,  which will bring savings to the U.S.  taxpayer.  In entitlement spending, we need to  bring down costs. We took a major step  forward in doing this in the Affordable  Care Act. One of the areas in which I  agree with  some of our Republican  friends who are criticizing the CBO is  that their numbers are off. We are  going to get more savings, not less,  than what the CBO estimated.  I am convinced that when you deal  with people in preventive health care  and use better information technology,  when you manage people\u2019s diseases,  when you deal with readmissions so  people understand what they need to  do to stay healthy, when you put all  that together, when you expand our  community health centers, as I said  earlier about what happened at the  Greater Baden center on prenatal care,  when you do all that,  it will bring  down the rate of health care costs.  America spends more than any other  nation, any way you want to calculate  it, on health care. We don\u2019t have the  health care results to demonstrate that  type of commitment. We can bring  down the cost of health care, and when  we do that, by implementing the Affordable Care Act and making sure we  get those savings, we will bring down  the Medicare costs and we will bring  down the Medicaid costs, which will  save taxpayers even more under our entitlement spending. We can get those  savings.  By the way, we are going to save  middle-income families in this country  by also reducing their costs for health  care. That is what we need to do to  make our economy stronger.  We can do something about entitlement spending, and there are other  areas we need to look at. The farm subsidy programs need to be reviewed, and  the  debt  commission  made  recommendations  in that regard that I  think are worthy of our review.  Then there is revenue. Yes, I think  we need to take a look at revenues. Our  current income tax structure cannot be  justified, as has been pointed out frequently. We hemorrhage as much revenue in our Tax Code as we raise. If  you eliminated all the special provisions, you could cut the tax rates in  half. Since we had tax reform in 1986,  we have added so many new loopholes  and provisions and special interest provisions in the Tax Code. In 1986, we attempted to lower the rates and make  sure everybody paid their fair share.  Well, it is now 2011, and we are out of  balance, and we need to look at tax reform.  I urge, in looking at tax reform, that  we should look at consumption-based  taxes. I know the criticisms of that,  but I will start by saying that if we had  consumption-based taxes to deal with  some of our income tax revenues, we  would  be more  competitive  internationally. If you are an export company and you are choosing whether to  locate in America or in another country, you pay income taxes here that  cannot be taken off the price of your  product when you put it in the international marketplace. If you locate in  another country that uses consumption  taxes at a higher level than we do\u2014we  don\u2019t use it at all\u2014but a higher level  than our income taxes, that country  will allow those exporters to take the  tax off when they put their products  into  the  international marketplace.  That  is acceptable under the World  Trade Organization, putting American  producers at a disadvantage.  We need to save more as a nation. We  have heard over and over the point  made that America, during the height  of our economic progress, had one of  the lowest savings ratios in the world.  We need to save more as a nation. Our  Tax Code  should  encourage  savings  much more than it does today.  I want to make it clear that I am totally committed that in tax reform we  should make our Tax Code more progressive. I don\u2019t believe it is progressive enough. Progressive means that it  is based, at least in part, on the ability  to pay. Wealthier people will pay a  higher percentage of the tax than lower  income people. Today, under our income tax system, many people do not  have to pay income tax now. We can  design a  consumption  tax,  so  they  won\u2019t have to pay a consumption tax  and there is no new tax burden. There  are proposals out there that can take  more people off the tax rolls.  By the way, this is a zero-sum game  on revenue. Let\u2019s decide how much we  need and then raise it in a cost-efficient way that will allow America to  grow.  That is the type of reform I hope we  will be able to get. If we do, it will  mean not only bringing our budget into  balance by a credible plan that deals  with discretionary domestic spending  and military and entitlement and revenues but does it in a way that allows  America to grow by investing in our future\u2014in education, in energy, in our  transportation infrastructure and transit and all those areas that we need\u2014so  that we can meet the challenges of the  future but do it in a way that is fiscally responsible.  How do we get this done? We get it  done by coming together and listening  to each other. I don\u2019t think anybody  here has a monopoly on what is right.  For the sake of our Nation, let\u2019s listen  to each other and try to get this done  in a way where we have a credible plan.  It has to be a credible plan. These are  not Democratic or Republican or Independent problems; these are American  issues. We have to put our Nation first.  I hope we will step back a little and  listen to the debate and use the debt  commission as a model of  civility.  Again, I am sure we will have different  views on it, but at the end of the day,  I hope we can achieve at least the deficit  reduction of  the commission.  I  think we can. The people of Maryland  and the country want us to do this.  Working together, I think we can accomplish those goals.  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. President, I have  been sitting in my office listening to  news reports about the Congress and  the President arguing about the budget  and  the debate about what we are  going to cut. It is interesting to think  back over the last couple of years, because it is hard to put these things together. After 2 years of the largest expansion of government, the biggest increase in debt in our history, now suddenly we are debating what needs to be  cut.  I think over the last couple of years  as the President proposed a massive  spending plan\u2014which we called a stimulus\u2014and Republicans were saying no,  that is not the way to improve the  economy. But the President insisted it  would keep unemployment below 8 percent and get our economy going again.

In particular, the legislation will move this  Nation\u2019s patent system to a first-inventor-to-file system, make important  quality enhancement mechanisms, and  provide the PTO with the resources it  needs to work through its backlog by  providing it with fee setting authority,  subject to oversight. The America Invents Act provides the tools the PTO  needs to separate the inventive wheat  from the chaff, which will help business  bring new products to market and create jobs.  Innovation has always been at the  heart of America and American success. From the founding of our Nation,  we recognized the importance of promoting and protecting innovation, and  so the Constitution explicitly grants  Congress the power to  \u2018\u2018promote the  progress and science and useful arts, by  securing for limited times to . . . inventors the exclusive right to their respective . . . discoveries.\u2019\u2019 The patent  system plays a key role in encouraging  innovation and bringing new products  to market. The discoveries made by  American inventors and research institutions, commercialized by our companies, and protected and promoted by  our patent laws have made our system  the envy of the world.  High quality patents are the key to  our  economic growth. They  benefit  both patent owners and users who can  be more confident in the validity of  issued patents. Patents of low quality  and dubious validity, by contrast, enable patent trolls who extort unreasonable  licensing  fees  from  legitimate  businesses, and constitute a drag on innovation. Too many dubious patents  also unjustly cast doubt on truly high  quality patents.  After 6 years of debate and discussion, more than a dozen hearings and  mark up sessions, and countless hours  of member and staff meetings with two  presidential administrations and interested parties across the spectrum, the  Senate is finally acting to make the  first meaningful,  comprehensive  reforms to the nation\u2019s patent system in  nearly 60 years. The Senate debate has  now extended for more than a week.  Passage of the America Invents Act  demonstrates what we can accomplish  when we cast aside partisan rhetoric,  and focus on working together for the  American people and for our future.  It has been almost  6 years  since  Chairman  and  Congressman  BERMAN introduced the first version of  patent reform legislation in 2005, but  the structure and guiding principles of  the legislation remain the same. The  bill will speed the process by which the  Patent Office  considers  applications  and should improve the quality of patents it issues.  Innovation  and  economic  development are not uniquely Democratic or  Republican objectives, so we worked  together to find the proper balance for  America\u2014for our economy, for our inSMITH ventors,  for our consumers. Working  together, we can smooth the path for  more  interesting\u2014and  great\u2014American inventions. That is what this bipartisan, comprehensive patent reform  bill will do. No one claims that ours is  a perfect bill. It is a compromise that  will make key  improvements  in the  patent  system. Having  coordinated  with the leaders in the House through  this process, I hope that the House will  look favorably on our work and adopt  this measure so that it can be sent to  the President without delay and its improvements can take effect in order to  encourage American  innovation and  promote American invention.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The  clerk will call the roll.  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to  call the roll.  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent  that the order for the quorum call be  rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without  objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent  the Reid amendment  No. 152 be withdrawn; that the Reid  amendment No. 143 be modified with  the changes at the desk; the Senate  proceed to vote on the amendment, as  modified, with no amendments in order  prior to the vote; that there then be 30  minutes of debate equally divided between the two managers or their designees; that S. 23 be read a third time;  that a budgetary pay-go statement be  read; the Senate then proceed to a vote  on passage of the bill, as amended; and  the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.  Further,  I ask unanimous consent  that at 12 noon Wednesday, March 9,  the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 14, H.R. 1, the Defense  appropriations  long-term  continuing resolution for fiscal year 2011;  that there be 3 hours of debate on H.R.  1 and the Democratic alternative, the  Inouye substitute amendment No. 149,  with the time equally divided between  the two leaders or their designees prior  to a vote on passage of H.R. 1; that the  vote on passage be subject to a 60-vote  threshold; that if the bill achieves 60  affirmative votes, the bill be read a  third time and passed; that if the bill  does not achieve 60 affirmative votes,  the majority leader be recognized to  offer the Inouye substitute amendment  No. 149; the Senate then proceed to a  vote on  the  substitute amendment;  that the substitute amendment be subject to a 60-vote threshold; if the substitute amendment achieves 60 affirmative votes, the substitute amendment  be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be  read a third time and passed; if the  substitute amendment does not achieve  60 affirmative votes, H.R. 1 be returned  to the calendar; that no motions or  amendments be in order to the substitute amendment or to the bill prior  to the votes; further, that all of the  above occur with no intervening action  or debate.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without  objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with this  agreement, I ask unanimous consent  that the cloture vote with respect to  the motion to proceed to H.R. 1 be vitiated.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without  objection, it is so ordered.  Mr.  REID. Mr.  President,  even  though there have been a few turns in  the road, we are at the place where we  need to be. We need to be able to show  the American people where we are on  these two measures. I express my appreciation to my friend, the Republican  leader. As I said, things don\u2019t always  work smoothly around here, but they  usually work. Now we are at a point  where we can vote on these two measures which is what we need to do.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under  the previous order, amendment No. 152  is withdrawn.  Under  the previous order, amendment No.  143  is modified with  the  changes at the desk.  The amendment, as modified, is as  follows:  (Purpose: To include public institutions of  higher education  in the definition of a  micro entity)  On page 93, before line 18, insert the following:  \u2018\u2018(d) STATE OFHIGHEREDUINSTITUTIONS CATION.\u2014  \u2018\u2018(1) INGENERAL.\u2014For purposes of this section, a micro entity shall include an applicant who certifies that\u2014  \u2018\u2018(A) the applicant\u2019s employer, from which  the applicant obtains the majority of the applicant\u2019s income, is a State public institution of higher education, as defined in section 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965  (20 U.S.C. 1002); or  \u2018\u2018(B) the applicant has assigned, granted,  conveyed, or is under an obligation by contract or law to assign, grant, or convey, a license or other ownership interest in the particular application to such State public institution.  \u2018\u2018(2) DIRECTOR\u2019SAUTHORITY.\u2014The Director  may, in the Director\u2019s discretion, impose income limits, annual filing limits, or other  limits on who may qualify as a micro entity  pursuant to this subsection if the Director  determines that such additional limits are  reasonably necessary to avoid an undue impact on other patent applicants or owners or  are otherwise reasonably necessary and appropriate. At least 3 months before any limits proposed to be imposed pursuant to this  paragraph shall take effect,  the Director  shall inform the Committee on the Judiciary  of the House of Representatives and the  Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate of  any such proposed limits.\u2019\u2019.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The  question is on agreeing to amendment  No. 143, as modified.  The amendment (No. 143), as modified, was agreed to.  Mr. COBURN. I wish to express my  opposition to Reid amendment No. 143,  as modified. I do not believe public institutions of higher education, or any  entity, should be carved out of the definition of micro entity in the underlying legislation.

            "76": "S1370  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE March 8, 2011  A prior-art parent application, however, must be copendent, have some  continuity of disclosure, and be specifically referred to in the patent or published application. The continuous disclosure must be a description of the  subject matter that  is relied on as  prior art. That description can become  narrower  in the  intervening applications. But so long as there is still some  description of the subject matter in the  intervening applications, the Office can  rely on an earlier application\u2019s fuller  description as prior art.  The  language of paragraph  (2)  is  somewhat indirect in its imposition of  these requirements. They are mostly  incorporated through the paragraph\u2019s  mandate that the prior-art application  be \u2018\u2018entitled to claim * * * priority or  benefit\u2019\u2019 under section 120 et al. In section 100(i), which defines the effective-  filing date of the patent under review,  the patent must be entitled to the priority or benefit itself under the relevant sections. Here again in section  102(d), however, the application need  only be entitled to claim the benefit or  priority under those sections. This difference in language, which offers an excellent example of why people hate  lawyers, distinguishes between the core  requirement of section 120 et al.\u2014that  the application include an enabling disclosure\u2014and the ministerial requirements of that section\u2014that the application be copendent and specifically  referenced.  In effect, an application  that meets  the ministerial  requirements of copendency and specific reference is entitled to claim the benefit  or priority, but only an application  that also offers an enabling disclosure  is actually entitled to the benefit or  priority itself. The language of paragraph (2) also expressly requires that  the earliest application \u2018\u2018describe\u2019\u2019 the  subject matter, and the Office has traditionally required that this disclosure  be continuous, as discussed above.  Paragraph  (2) can be criticized as  codifying current BPAI common  law  and examination practice without fully  describing that practice. However, a  fully descriptive codification of  the  principles codified therein would be unduly long, requiring repetition of the  already somewhat inelegant language  of section 120.  Another aspect of the bill\u2019s changes  to current section 102 also merits special mention. New  section  102(a)(1)  makes two important changes to the  definition  of  non-patent  prior  art.  First, it lifts current law\u2019s geographic  limits on what uses, knowledge, or  sales constitute prior art. And second,  it limits all non-patent prior art to  that which is available to the public.  This latter change is clearly identified  in Senate Report 110\u2013259, the report for  S. 1145, the predecessor to this bill in  the 110th Congress. The words \u2018\u2018otherwise available  to  the public\u2019\u2019 were  added to section 102(a)(1) during that  Congress\u2019s Judiciary Committee mark  up of the bill. The word \u2018\u2018otherwise\u2019\u2019  makes clear that the preceding clauses  describe things that are of the same  quality or nature as the final clause\u2014  that is, although different categories of  prior art are listed, all of them are limited to that which makes the invention  \u2018\u2018available to the public.\u2019\u2019 As the committee report notes at page 9,  \u2018\u2018the  phrase \u2018available to the public\u2019 is added  to clarify the broad scope of relevant  prior art, as well as to emphasize the  fact that it [i.e., the relevant prior art]  must be publicly available.\u2019\u2019 In other  words, as the report notes, \u2018\u2018[p]rior art  will be measured from the filing date of  the application and will include all art  that publicly exists prior to the filing  date, other than disclosures by the inventor within one year of filing.\u2019\u2019  The Committee\u2019s understanding of  the effect of adding the words \u2018\u2018or otherwise available to the public\u2019\u2019 is confirmed by judicial construction of this  phraseology. Courts have consistently  found that when the words \u2018\u2018or otherwise\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018or other\u2019\u2019 are used to add a  modifier at  the end of a  string of  clauses, the modifier thus added restricts the meaning of the preceding  clauses. Strom v. Goldman, Sachs & Co.,  202 F.3d 138, 146\u201347, Second Cir. 1999,  states that:  The position of the phrase \u2018or any other equitable relief\u2019 in the sentence in which it appears indicates that it modifies one or both  of the two specific remedies referred to just  before it in the same sentence * * * [T]he use  of the words \u2018other\u2019 immediately after the  reference to back pay and before \u2018equitable  relief\u2019 demonstrated Congress\u2019 understanding  that the back pay remedy is equitable in nature.  Strom construed the phrase \u2018\u2018may include * * * back pay, * * * or any other  equitable relief.\u2019\u2019 Universal City Studios,  Inc. v. Reimerdes, 111 F.Supp.2d 294, 325,  S.D.N.Y. 2000, holds that:  The statute makes it unlawful to offer,  provide or otherwise  traffic  in described  technology. To \u2018traffic\u2019 in something is to  engage in dealings in it, conduct that necessarily involves awareness of the nature of  the subject of the trafficking. * * * The  phrase \u2018or otherwise traffic in\u2019 modifies and  gives meaning to the words \u2018offer\u2019 and \u2018provide.\u2019 In consequence, the anti-trafficking  provision of the DMCA is implicated where  one presents, holds out or makes a circumvention technology or device available,  knowing its nature, for the purpose of allowing others to acquire it.  Reimerdes  construed  the  phrase  \u2018\u2018offer to the public, provide, or otherwise  traffic  in  any  technology.\u2019\u2019  Williamson v. Southern Regional Council,  Inc., 223 Ga. 179, 184, 154 S.E.2d 21, 25  (Ga. 1967), noted that:  The words \u2018carrying on propaganda\u2019 in this  statute must be construed  in connection  with the words following it, \u2018or otherwise attempting to influence legislation.\u2019 The use of  the word \u2018otherwise\u2019 indicates that \u2018carrying  on propaganda\u2019 relates to \u2018attempting to influence legislation.\u2019  Williamson  construed  the  phrase  \u2018\u2018carrying on propaganda, or otherwise  attempting to influence legislation.\u2019\u2019  In other words, the Judiciary Committee\u2019s  design  in  adding  the  2007  amendment to section 102(a)(1), as expressed in the relevant committee report, is consistent with the unanimous  judicial construction of the same turn  of phrase. It appears that every court  that  has  considered  this  question  agrees with  the committee\u2019s understanding of the meaning of this language.  Moreover, the fact that the clause  \u2018\u2018or otherwise available to the public\u2019\u2019  is set off from its preceding clauses by  a comma confirms that it applies to  both  \u2018\u2018public  use\u2019\u2019  and  \u2018\u2018on  sale.\u2019\u2019  Finisar Corp. v. DirecTV Group, Inc., 523  F.3d 1323, 1336, Fed. Cir. 2008, notes that  \u2018\u2018when a modifier is set off from a series of antecedents by a comma, the  modifier should be read to apply to  each of those antecedents.\u2019\u2019 Thus new  section 102(a)(1) imposes a public-availability standard on the definition of all  prior art enumerated by the bill\u2014an  understanding on which the remainder  of the bill is predicated.  Whether an invention has been made  available to the public is the same inquiry that is undertaken under existing law to determine whether a document has become publicly accessible,  but is conducted in a more generalized  manner to account for disclosures of  information that are not in the form of  documents.  A document is publicly accessible if it has  been disseminated or otherwise made available to the extent that persons interested  and ordinarily skilled in the subject matter  or art, exercising reasonable diligence, can  locate  it and  recognize and  comprehend  therefrom the essentials of the claimed invention without need of further research or  experimentation.  That is a quotation from Cordis Corp.  v. Boston Scientific Corp., 561 F.3d 1319,  1333, Fed. Cir. 2009. That decision also  states that \u2018\u2018[i]n general, accessibility  goes to the issue of whether interested  members of the relevant public could  obtain the information if they wanted  to.\u2019\u2019 See also In re Lister, 583 F.3d 1307,  Fed. Cir. 2009.  Another important aspect of public  availability or accessibility is the doctrine of inherency. \u2018\u2018Under the doctrine  of inherency, if an element is not expressly disclosed  in a prior art reference,  the  reference will  still  be  deemed  to  anticipate  a  subsequent  claim if the missing element is necessarily present in the thing described  in the reference, and that it would be  so recognized by persons of ordinary  skill,\u2019\u2019 a point noted in Rosco, Inc. v.  Mirror Lite Co., 304 F.3d 1373, 1380, Fed.  Cir. 2002. This doctrine applies to products sold to the public as well as published references. Thus once a product  is sold on the market, any invention  that  is  inherent to the product becomes publicly available prior art and  cannot be patented.  The present bill\u2019s elimination of the  patent forfeiture doctrines in favor of a  general  public  availability  standard  also limits and reconciles the various  purposes that previously have been ascribed  to  section  102\u2019s definition of  prior art. Current 102(b), which imposes  the forfeiture doctrines, has been described as being \u2018\u2018primarily concerned  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:01 Mar 09, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A08MR6.031 S08MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s t r e b o r s         ",
            "84": "S1378  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE March 8, 2011  making pre-issuance submissions. The  Office sought this change because a foreign publication can be deemed a publication under section 122, and the Office  wants to ensure that it is only required  to collect third-party submissions for  an application if that application is actually filed in the United States.  Section 8 of the present bill omits  provisions appearing in prior bills that  would have created an expanded right  to an interlocutory appeal from claim-  construction rulings. Even as revised  in the 2009 Judiciary Committee mark  up, previous section 8(b) gave the Federal Circuit insufficient discretion to  turn away such appeals and posed a serious risk of overwhelming the court.  The 2009 mark-up revisions allowed the  Federal Circuit to reject an interlocutory appeal if it found clear error in  the district court\u2019s certification that  there is a sufficient evidentiary record  for an interlocutory appeal and that  such an appeal may advance the termination of the litigation or will likely  control the outcome of the case. It  would be difficult in any case, however,  to reject a finding that an interlocutory appeal of claim-construction rulings may lead to the termination of the  litigation. Moreover, if a district judge  has certified a case for interlocutory  appeal,  it  is very unlikely that the  record that he has created would support a finding that his decision is clearly erroneous. And  finally, given the  disdain for patent cases felt by a substantial  number  of  district  judges,  there  is a serious  likelihood that a  large number of judges would take advantage of a new authorization from  Congress to send away such cases to  the Federal Circuit, with the hope that  they do not return. Current law\u2019s grant  of discretion to the Federal Circuit to  entertain  interlocutory  appeals  of  claim-construction rulings strikes the  appropriate balance.  Section 10 of the present bill authorizes  supplemental  examination of a  patent to correct errors or omissions in  proceedings before the Office. Under  this new procedure, information that  was not considered or was inadequately  considered or was incorrect can be presented to the Office. If the Office determines that the information does not  present a substantial new question of  patentability or that the patent is still  valid, that information cannot be used  as a basis for an inequitable-conduct  attack on the surviving patent in civil  litigation. New section 257(c)(1) follows  the usual practice of referring to inequitable-conduct attacks in terms of  unenforceability,  rather  than  invalidity, though courts have in the past  used the terms interchangeably when  describing the effect of fraud or inequitable conduct on a patent. J.P. Stevens  & Co., Inc. v. Lex Tex Ltd., Inc., 747 F.2d  1553, 1560, Fed. Cir. 1984, notes that  \u2018\u2018[w]hether the holding should be one of  invalidity or unenforceability has had  no practical significance in cases thus  far presented to this court.\u2019\u2019 The term  should be considered to be used interchangeably with  \u2018\u2018invalidity\u2019\u2019 in this  bill as well. Obviously, Congress would  not create a procedure for reexamining  patents that allowed them to be protected against subsequent inequitable-  conduct challenges of unenforceability,  only to allow the same patents to be  challenged on the same basis and declared invalid on the basis of inequitable conduct.  While some critics of this proposal  have suggested that it would immunize  misconduct by  inventors and practitioners, I would note that the Patent  Office has ample authority to sanction  such misconduct. Under section 32 of  title 35, the Office can bar an attorney  from appearing before the Office if he  has engaged in misconduct in any proceeding before the Office. In section 2(l)  of this bill, we have extended the statute of limitations for initiating such a  proceeding. Under current regulations,  the Office also sanctions misconduct by  striking offending filings or reducing  the weight that they are given. And the  Federal Circuit has recognized that the  Office also \u2018\u2018has inherent authority to  govern procedure before the [Office],\u2019\u2019  as noted in In re Bogese II, 303 F.3d  1362, 1368, Fed. Cir. 2002, and that inherent authority to sanction attorneys for  misconduct is not restricted to Article  III courts, a point noted in In re Bailey, 182 F.3d 860, 864 n.4, Fed. Cir. 1999.  Given the Office\u2019s existing tools for  sanctioning misconduct,  there  is no  need to make the courts into supervisors of attorney conduct  in Office  proceedings. It is doubtful that a practitioner who is discovered to have engaged in substantial misconduct in proceedings before the Office would escape  adequate and effective sanction by the  Office itself.  Section 11 of the bill repeals the so-  called Baldwin  rule, which  requires  judges on the Federal Circuit to live  within 50 miles of Washington, D.C.  Subsection (b) provides that the repeal  of the Baldwin rule shall not be construed to imply that the Administrative Office of the Courts must provide  court facilities or administrative support services to judges who choose to  reside outside of the District of Columbia. This proviso does not affect the  AOC\u2019s existing authority  to provide  services to judges outside of the District of Columbia.  Its  reference  to  \u2018\u2018court facilities\u2019\u2019 means space within a  courthouse or federal building, and the  reference to  \u2018\u2018administrative support  services\u2019\u2019 means  those  services  that  would be provided to judges within a  courthouse or federal building.  In section 15 of the bill, a conforming  subsection (b) has been added to ensure  that the best-mode requirement cannot  be used to challenge a patent\u2019s entitlement to a right of priority or to the  benefit of an earlier filing date. In the  new effective-date subsection, the section  is made applicable to all  \u2018\u2018proceedings\u2019\u2019 commenced after enactment  of the Act, in order to make clear that  the section\u2019s changes to the law will be  immediately applicable not just in litigation but also in post-grant reviews of  patents under chapter 32.  At subsections (a) through (h), section 16 of the bill has been modified by  reinserting  language  that eliminates  various deceptive-intent requirements  that relate to correcting the naming of  the inventor or a joint inventor, obtaining a retroactive foreign filing license, seeking section 251 reissue, or  enforcing remaining valid claims if a  claim  is  invalidated. See  generally  Kearney & Trecker Corp. v. Giddings &  Lewis, Inc., 452 F.2d 579, 596, 7th Cir.  1971. These changes were first proposed  in section 5 of the original Patent Reform Act of 2005, H.R. 2795, 109th Congress, and have been advocated by universities and their technology-transfer  offices. For reasons that are not entirely  clear,  subsequent bills maintained this section and its addition of  substructure and titles to the affected  code  sections,  but  struck  the  substantive part of the section\u2014i.e., its  elimination of the deceptive-intent requirements.  Eliminating the various deceptive-intent requirements moves the U.S. patent system away from the 19th century  model that focused on the patent owner\u2019s subjective intent, and towards a  more objective-evidence-based system  that will be much cheaper to litigate  and more efficient to administer.  Section 16(i) of the present bill corrects several errors and typos throughout title 35 that are noted in the reviser\u2019s notes to the U.S. Code.  Section 16(j) strikes unnecessary references  to  \u2018\u2018of  this  title\u2019\u2019  that are  sprinkled throughout title 35. The 1952  Act  included  such unnecessary  references, but more recent additions to  the code have not, and the current  bill\u2019s changes omit such references. Because the unnecessary references greatly outnumber the necessary references,  the provision is written to strike all  references but then except out the necessary references.  The present bill\u2019s new section 17 enacts the so-called Holmes Group fix,  H.R. 2955, 109th Congress, which was reported out of the House Judiciary Committee in 2006. The committee report  accompanying that bill, House Report  109\u2013407, explains the bill\u2019s reasons for  abrogating  Holmes  Group,  Inc.  v.  Vornado Air Circulation Systems,  Inc.,  535 U.S. 826 (2002), and more fully precluding state court  jurisdiction over  patent legal claims.  Section 17 makes two modifications  to the reported version of H.R. 2955.  The first modification, at subsection  (c), limits the bill\u2019s expansion of Federal Circuit jurisdiction to only compulsory counterclaims asserting patent  rights, rather than the original bill\u2019s  expansion of  jurisdiction  to  include  any  counterclaim  asserting  patent  rights. Compulsory counterclaims are  defined at Rule 13(a) and basically consist of counterclaims that arise out of  the same transaction or occurrence and  that do not require the joinder of parties over whom the court would lack  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:01 Mar 09, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A08MR6.043 S08MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s t r e b o r s         ",

I  thank Carl  Gulbrandsen, Howard Bremmer, Andy  Cohn, and Mike Remington. I thank  Todd Dickinson and Vince Garlock of  AIPLA, and Jim Crowne, who was willing to come to the Senate to double  check the draft enrolled bill. I should  also mention Herb Wamsley of Intellectual Property Owners, as well as Dana  Colarulli, who has worn two hats during the course of his work on this bill,  first with IPO, and subsequently as the  head of legislative affairs at the PTO.  Key participants at the PTO have also  included Mike Fleming, John Love,  Jim Toupin, and Rob Clarke. And of  course I must mention the current Director, David Kappos, without whose  effort and dedication the passage of the  present bill would not have been possible.  Finally, allow me to acknowledge the  key members of the 21st Century Coalition for Patent Reform, who have devoted countless hours to this bill, and  stuck with it through thick and thin.  They have also formed an important  \u2018\u2018kitchen cabinet\u2019\u2019 that has been indispensable to the committee\u2019s drafting of  this bill and to the resolution of difficult technical questions.

Mr. President, as  someone who voted to freeze salaries,  to end earmarks in this budget process,  as someone who has already voted to  cut $45 billion from the budget, I rise  today in recognition that business as  usual cannot continue. I recognize the  critical importance of addressing our  Federal deficit\u2014a deficit, I would add,  inherited by this administration, a deficit driven by two wars, both unpaid  for, and the unprecedented need  for  governmental action to mitigate the  wild excesses of Wall Street and American financial markets, excesses that  were effectively condoned by the last  administration, whose  policies  took  this Nation to the brink of a second  Great Depression and cost millions of  American jobs.  I never forget that time in late 2008  when Chairman Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, came before members of  the Banking Committee and members of the leadership  and described the circumstances that  were unfolding in the country in which  a series of financial institutions, according  to Chairman Bernanke and  then-Secretary Paulson, the Secretary  of  the Treasury\u2014they  said: We are  going to have a series of financial institutions collapse, and if they collapse,  they will create systemic risk to the  entire country\u2019s economy, and every  American will feel the consequences of  that collapse. I remember how hushed  that room was.  I remember also the question being  put to Chairman Bernanke: Surely you  must have enough tools at the Federal  Reserve to get us through this period  of time. I remember the response to  that question, which was basically:  Senator, if you and your colleagues do  not act in a matter of days, maybe a  week, we will have a global financial  meltdown, which really meant a new  depression.  Chairman Bernanke is an academician. His expertise is in depression-era  economics, how this Nation got into  the last depression, how Roosevelt got  us out of it. So when he made that  statement, it was all the more chilling.  It is from that moment in 2008, before  this President took office and Democrats were in full control here, that, in  fact, we were facing the challenges we  are today.  Those of us who believe in a free market also know you cannot have a free-  for-all market. We had economic policies for the Bush 8 years, two wars raging  abroad,  an unregulated market  that allowed for the free-for-all that  brought us on the brink of a new depression, and that is what we are meeting the challenges of today.  Those choices then and the choices  we make, what we choose to cut and  what we determine is in our interest,  will speak volumes about our values,  our priorities as a people and as a Nation.  Mr. President, I favor smart cuts, not  dangerous  ones.  In  an  independent  analysis of H.R. 1, which we are going  to be voting on tomorrow\u2014the Republican vision of where we should take  the country\u2014shows we are losing about  700,000 jobs. But we are trying to grow  jobs in America. We have finally gotten into positive gross domestic product of our Nation\u2019s economy. We are  seeing job growth. I would like to see it  be even more robust, but H.R. 1 takes  us back the opposite way and threatens  the very essence of this economic recovery\u2014700,000 jobs.  Don\u2019t believe what I say because I  say it is so, but because those in the  know  say  it\u2014Ben Bernanke:  \u2018\u2018The  GOP\u2019s plan will cut jobs.\u2019\u2019 Economist  Mark Zandi: \u2018\u2018The GOP plan would cost  700,000 jobs.\u2019\u2019 Here is another analysis:  House  spending cuts will hurt economic growth. So what we have  is  economist after economist telling us  that H.R. 1 is a recipe for disaster when  it comes to the question of  jobs  in  America.  That analysis which says we would  slash 700,000 jobs directly impacts the  lives of middle-class and working families struggling to get back on their  feet. They are severe cuts that run  roughshod over the green shoots of economic recovery just to satisfy a political agenda. I  favor smart commonsense cuts\u2014cuts made with a surgeon\u2019s  knife not a meat ax; cuts that are  thoughtful, surgically precise cuts that  actually reduce the deficit, not cuts  that eliminate  jobs and disinvest  in  educational opportunities for millions  of promising young Americans, not  cuts that hurt middle-class  families  struggling to make ends meet, make  our workforce  less competitive, our  communities less safe, and strip away  basic protections Americans have come  to take for granted.  In my view, we can preserve our values and invest in the future, invest in  out-educating,  out-innovating,  out-  greening, and out-growing the world  and still cut the deficit. To begin with,  Secretary Gates of the Department of  Defense has identified $78 billion in defense spending cuts alone. He has identified $178 billion  in program reductions over 5 years, including delaying  or  terminating  high-profile weapon  systems.  I agree with Secretary Gates that we  can live without the Marine Corps variant of the F\u201335 Joint Strike Fighter as  well as the Marine Corps Expeditionary  Fighting Vehicle. The Secretary has  identified $54 billion in cuts in overhead  costs  and  improved  efficiency  across defense agencies and the civilian  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:45 Mar 09, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G08MR6.057 S08MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s t r e b o r s         ",

As a qualification to the statutory obligation to issue regulations that are \u2018\u2018the  same as the most substantive regulations  (applicable with respect to the Executive  branch)\u2019\u2019, section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA authorizes the Board to \u2018\u2018determine, for good  cause shown and stated together with the  regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be more effective for the implementation of the rights and protections  under\u2019\u2019 section 4(c) of the VEOA.  (c) Rationale for Departure from the Most  Relevant Executive Branch Regulations. The  Board concludes that  it must promulgate  regulations accommodating the human resource systems existing in the Legislative  branch; and that such regulations must take  into account the fact that the Board does not  possess the statutory and Executive Order  based government-wide policy making authority underlying OPM\u2019s counterpart VEOA  regulations governing the Executive branch.  OPM\u2019s regulations are designed for the competitive  service  (defined  in  5  U.S.C.  2102(a)(2)), which does not exist in the employing offices subject to this regulation.  Therefore, to  follow the OPM regulations  would create detailed and complex rules and  procedures  for a workforce that does not  exist in the Legislative branch, while providing no VEOA protections to the covered  Legislative branch employees. We have chosen to propose specially tailored regulations,  rather than simply to adopt those promulgated by OPM, so that we may effectuate  Congress\u2019s intent in extending the principles  of the veterans\u2019 preference laws to the Legislative branch through the VEOA.

Among the relevant provisions of  section 225 are subsection (f)(1), which prescribes as a rule of construction that definitions and exemptions in the laws made applicable by the CAA shall apply under the CAA,  and subsection (f)(3), which states that the  CAA shall not be considered to authorize enforcement of  the CAA by  the Executive  branch.

            "116": "S1410  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE March 8, 2011  So, what would the ROADS SAFE  Act do? This legislation would authorize $12 million annually for the DADSS  program. This  is not new spending.  Funding for this program would come  from the existing, and often unspent,  Seat Belt Incentive grants program.  This is a smart investment in public  safety. In addition to the human costs,  drunk driving also has direct and indirect  economic  costs. Those  include  damaged property, medical bills, and  lost productivity. In economic terms,  drunk driving costs $129 billion dollars  per year. Of course,  such monetary  costs cannot be compared to the value  of saving 8,000 lives every year.  Several organizations dedicated  to  fighting drunk driving already support  this  bipartisan  proposal.  Mothers  Against Drunk Driving, the Century  Council, and the Distilled Spirits Council all have signed on in support of the  ROADS SAFE Act.  I urge my Senate colleagues to join  me, Senator CORKER, and these important organizations in the fight against  drunk driving. We urge you to support  the ROADS SAFE Act. We have made  much progress in our efforts to prevent  drunk driving, but there is so much  more to be done.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 510  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the \u2018\u2018Research of  Alcohol Detection Systems for Stopping Alcohol-related Fatalities Everywhere Act of  2011\u2019\u2019 or the \u2018\u2018ROADS SAFE Act of 2011\u2019\u2019.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  Congress finds the following:  (1) Alcohol-impaired driving fatalities represent approximately 1\u20443 of all highway fatalities in the United States in a given year.  (2) In 2009, there were 10,839 alcohol-impaired driving fatalities.  (3) An estimated 9,000 road traffic deaths  could be prevented every year if alcohol detection technologies were more widely used  to prevent alcohol-impaired drivers from operating their vehicles.  (4) The National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration has partnered with automobile manufacturers to develop alcohol detection technologies that could be installed  in vehicles to prevent drunk driving.  (5) Alcohol detection technologies will not  be widely accepted by the public unless they  are moderately priced, absolutely reliable,  and set at a level that would not prevent a  driver whose blood alcohol content is less  than the legal limit from operating a vehicle.  SEC. 3. DRIVER ALCOHOL DETECTION SYSTEM  FOR SAFETY RESEARCH.

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself  and Mr. GRASSLEY):  S. 513. A bill to amend the Controlled  Substances Act to provide enhanced  penalties for marketing controlled substances to minors; to the Committee  on the Judiciary.  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President,  I  am pleased to  introduce, along with  Senator GRASSLEY,  the Saving Kids  From Dangerous Drugs Act of 2011.  For years, law enforcement has seen  drug dealers flavoring and marketing  their  illegal drugs to entice minors,  using techniques like combining drugs  with chocolate and fruit flavors, and  even packaging them to look like actual candy and soda. This bill would  address  this  serious  and  dangerous  problem by providing  stronger penalties when drug dealers alter controlled substances by combining them  with beverages or candy products, marketing or packaging them to resemble  legitimate products, or  flavoring or  coloring them with the intent to sell  them to minors.  Recent media  reports demonstrate  the need for this legislation. The Santa  Cruz Sentinel had an article earlier  this month about someone who is planning to market sodas laced with THC,  the psychoactive component in marijuana. Some of his planned sodas include orange-flavored \u2018\u2018Orange Krush\u2019\u2019  and grape-flavored \u2018\u2018Grape Ape\u2019\u2019 which  actually was the name of a children\u2019s  cartoon character!  Regrettably, this is a problem that  has persisted for many years, with drug  dealers trying various methods of luring kids to try many dangerous drugs.  For example, in March of 2008, Drug  Enforcement  Administration,  DEA,  agents  seized cocaine near Modesto,  California, that had been flavored like  cinnamon, coconut, lemon and strawberry.  Similarly, there have been many incidents  involving methamphetamine.  In a 2007 article entitled Flavored Meth  Use on the Rise, USA Today stated  that \u2018\u2018reports of candy-flavored methamphetamine are emerging around the  nation, stirring concern among police  and abuse prevention experts that drug  dealers  are marketing  the  drug  to  younger people.\u2019\u2019  The size and sophistication of some  of  these  operations  is  particularly  alarming. In March of 2006, DEA discovered large-scale marijuana cultivation  and  production  facilities  in  Emeryville and Oakland, California.  Thousands of marijuana plants, and  thousands of marijuana-related soda,  candy, and other products were seized  from the drug dealers\u2019 facilities. The  products were designed and packaged  to look like legitimate products, including an item called \u2018\u2018Munchy Way\u2019\u2019  candy bars.  Current law already provides an enhanced penalty if someone distributes  drugs to a minor. Under this provision,  the maximum sentence for the underlying distribution offense is doubled,  and tripled if it is a repeat offense.  Similarly, this bill would provide an  enhanced penalty in those situations  where drug dealers are altering controlled substances in ways that could  make them more appealing to minors.  Someone who is altering a controlled  substance in ways prohibited by the  legislation would be subject to a penalty of up to ten years, in addition to  the penalty for the underlying offense.  If someone commits a second offense  prohibited by the act, they would be  face an additional penalty of up to 20  years.  This bill sends a strong and clear  message to drug dealers\u2014if you flavor  or candy up your drugs to try to entice  our children, there will be a very heavy  price to pay. It will help stop drug  dealers from engaging in these activities, and punish them appropriately if  they don\u2019t.  The Senate passed a similar version  of this legislation in the last Congress,  but it was not considered in the House.

TOM LATHAM  OFIOWA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 8, 2011  Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize  the achievements of  the eighth-  grade students at Carlisle Middle School  in  Carlisle,  Iowa. These students  recently  finished first in the nation in the FBI\u2019s Safe Online Surfing (SOS) Internet Challenge in December 2010.  The SOS  Internet Challenge  is a national  competition that seeks to educate elementary  and middle school students about the importance of safety when using the internet. The  topics include protecting personal information,  online predators, cyberbullying,  instant messaging,  social  networking,  copyright,  and  more. Scores  in  this competition are determined by a series of web-based quizzes the  students  take after completing  the program.  Over 1,000 eighth-grade students  from 47  schools  in 17 states participated  in  the December SOS Internet Challenge.  The Carlisle Middle School eighth-grade students completed the SOS Internet Challenge  under the direction of their technology instructor Julie Thompson. While  the class as a  whole placed first in the challenge, those students who received the top scores were Bailey  Garner, Kaleigh Haus, Max Becker,  Lynn  Huang, and Josh Hagedorn. These five students were awarded FBI bags  that  included  school supplies and certificates.  I commend  the eighth-grade students at  Carlisle Middle School  for  their exemplary  work  in  the SOS  Internet Challenge.  In  this  world of advanced technology that allows for  increased networking, it is imperative that our  children know how  to keep  themselves and  their personal information safe.  I know  that my colleagues  in  the United  States Congress will join me in congratulating  these students on their accomplishments. It is  an honor to serve as their representative, and  I wish them the best of luck in the future.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF JOE BURNS  HON. JACKIE SPEIER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 8, 2011  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor  Joe Burns, a U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman  from San Bruno who will celebrate his 20th  birthday on March 5, 2011. This is an extraordinary birthday for Joe, not only because he is  entering the second decade of his life, but because it\u2019s a miracle that he is alive.  Joe\u2019s job was to provide medical care for  Marines with Delta Company, 1st Battalion,  1st Marine Division  in Afghanistan. On February 17, 2011 he and three Marines were in  an armored  vehicle  in Helmand Province,  when they struck an Improvised Explosive Device. The  IED  literally blew up underneath  Joe\u2019s feet. The vehicle went up in the air and  was propelled forward. Joe broke five bones in  his heel and suffered a concussion. One Marine also suffered a heel injury, the other two  were not hurt.  It  is absolutely miraculous  that everyone  survived the ambush. The vehicle was Mine  Resistant Ambush Protected, or MRAP. Joe\u2019s  mother Lori Burns is convinced that it was that  technology that saved her son\u2019s life. She recalls how she first learned about the incident.  The hospital corpsman  treating Joe handed  him a phone and he said:  \u2018\u2018Mom,  I\u2019m ok,  I  broke my heel, they blew me up. I got to fly  in a helo and  I  think  I\u2019m getting a Purple  Heart.\u2019\u2019  Joe was treated in hospitals in Afghanistan,  Germany and San Diego and received a cast  on his foot in each place. This young man did  not want to leave Afghanistan; he wanted to  continue serving his country despite his injury.  I want to thank Joe for his service. He represents the courage and bravery of our troops.  Joe grew up in San Bruno, California and  went to St. Roberts Elementary School. After  he graduated from Burlingame High School in  June 2009, he was enlisted in the Navy in October of the same year.  On January 1, 2011, Joe was deployed on  his first tour to Afghanistan\u2014not exactly what  he expected. When you enlist in the Navy, his  mother quotes Joe as saying, you think you  are going to be on water, not sand. It was on  day 47 of his deployment that the IED blew up  underneath him and sent him back home.  Mr. Speaker, I ask this body to rise with me  to celebrate the life and 20th birthday of Joe  Burns on this day, March 5, 2011.  f  CELEBRATING INTERNATIONAL  WOMEN\u2019S DAY  HON. MAURICE D. HINCHEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 8, 2011  Mr. HINCHEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay  tribute  to  International Women\u2019s Day,  which  recognizes and  celebrates  the economic, political, and social achievements of  women  throughout  our  global  community.  Since 1911, millions of women and men have  gathered together on this date to campaign for  the right of women to vote, work, hold public  office and be  treated without discrimination.  This year marks the Global Centenary of International Women\u2019s Day and I am proud to help  commemorate this anniversary by recognizing  the  incomparable achievements  that women  here in the United States and throughout the  world have thus far achieved.  Over  the years, women have made great  strides  in  their quest  for equality and we  should applaud these advances. However, we  must also recognize that our work is not over.  While women now hold positions in the highest ranks of government, work as doctors, scientists and attorneys, their wages still lag behind those of men performing the same work.  The passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay  Act moved us one step closer to equality in  the workplace, but there is still progress to be  made. And  though  it  is encouraging  that  crimes against women are now  treated with  the seriousness  they deserve,  the  rate of  crimes committed against women continues to  exceed that of those committed against men.  Although we must view  the advances  that  have been achieved as heartening and important strides forward, we must continue to labor  until full equality and equal access to opportunity for women is achieved.  In New York\u2019s 22nd Congressional District,  which I proudly represent, the Dutchess County Regional Chamber of Commerce and Women\u2019s Leadership Alliance, along with their partners in all of the other area Chambers, have  been engaged  in promoting, supporting and  encouraging  the  leadership,  professional  growth  and  economic  success  of women  throughout  the Hudson Valley  region. Their  successes are clearly a shining example of  the creative accomplishments that have been  realized by women worldwide. I wish to compliment the Chamber on the excellent leadership in supporting women to succeed.  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to  recognize the women of the Hudson Valley, all  of  the members of  the Dutchess Regional  Chamber of Commerce, as well as women  throughout  the world as  they celebrate  the  100th anniversary of  International Women\u2019s  Day. I am proud to stand with them as they  continue to work tirelessly toward full equality  for women everywhere.  f  HONORING CASIMIR PULASKI, POLISH-AMERICAN  HERO  OF  THE  REVOLUTIONARY WAR AND HONORARY AMERICAN CITIZEN, AND  CELEBRATING PULASKI DAY  HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 8, 2011  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor the life of Polish and American freedom  fighter Casimir Pulaski. Yesterday in my home  state of Illinois, we celebrated Casimir Pulaski  Day, which is observed on the first Monday of  March. Prior to the Pulaski Day celebration at  the Polish Museum of America in Chicago, I  joined with Representative MIKEQUIGLEYand  Senator MARKKIRK to announce the introduction of a new bill to push for Poland\u2019s inclusion  in the Visa Waiver Program. Certainly there is  no better day than the one honoring Casimir  Pulaski to promote the strengthening of America\u2019s ties with Poland.  Born in Warsaw, Poland, on March 6, 1745,  Casimir Pulaski was a skilled commander who  fought  against Russian  forces  in Poland.  Based upon his work fighting for freedom in  Poland, Pulaski was  recruited by Benjamin  Franklin to join in the American Revolution. In  his  first correspondence  to George Washington, Pulaski famously wrote, \u2018\u2018I came here,  where freedom is being defended, to serve it,  and to live or die for it.\u2019\u2019 In his first battle of  the Revolution,  the Battle of Brandywine on  September 11, 1777, Pulaski helped alter the  course of history by rallying a counterattack  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:29 Mar 09, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\A08MR8.010 E08MRPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 B 6 X X D 1 K S D n o s t r e b o r s         ",

So I ask my colleagues to vote for  this legislation and remove this costly,  ineffective,  and  painful  government  program.  b1440  Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I yield  3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from  New York (Mrs. MCCARTHY), a member  of the committee.  Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. Mr.  Chairman, let me say something first.  In the beginning of this program, we  didn\u2019t have any service. That means  there were no people out there to help  those that were trying to apply. But we  have  seen encouraging  signs  in  the  economy; yet we are still on a long  path  towards  economical  recovery.  Many of my constituents are still facing hardship, including trying to keep  their homes.  When the housing crisis hit, the private sector responded by turning their  backs on those that needed the help. As  a result, Congress stepped in and created housing programs to hold the industry accountable and to help these  families weather the worst housing crisis that we have seen in generations.  Now, thanks to the leadership of the  President  and  the Democratic-controlled 111th Congress, we are seeing  more and more servicers adopting their  own programs, largely based on the eligibility criteria within the programs  such as HAMP.  The past few weeks my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle have brought  bills to the floor to terminate these  programs,  claiming  they have done  more harm than good to the homeowner and that struggling homeowners  are in better hands with the private  companies  that  contributed  to  the  housing crisis in the first place. Most  of the homeowners got in trouble because the private sector is the one that  got them in the problems.  I disagree with that and point to constituents who have reached out to my  office for help because their servicers  were not being responsive.  The bill before us totally terminates  the HAMP program; however, it protects assistance to the homeowners in  a trial or a permanent modification.  My amendment, which was not made  in order, would have expanded that  provision to include homeowners who,  on or before March 1 of this year, submitted required paperwork for HAMP  or had made a verified request to their  servicers seeking that modification.  My district office has heard from dozens and dozens of my constituents who  have been waiting for up to 16 months,  16 months for a response from their  servicer regarding the eligibility  for  HAMP. They reach out to my office at  the point of total frustration due to  the lengthy response time when they  have  submitted  the  required paperwork. I shudder to think what the response rate would have been without  this program in place.  It\u2019s very disheartening that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  would  like to shut down these distressed homeowners before they have  even a chance to qualify for the assistance.  The HAMP program was by no means  perfect. Everybody agrees on that. Nor  was it meant to be permanent. We all  agree on that. Instead, it was meant to  hold the mortgage service industry accountable and responsive to those that  needed the assistance.  At a time when our housing market  is still very  fragile and  foreclosures  continue to occur in record numbers,  instead of terminating these programs,  we should be trying to improve them.  During  the markup  in committee,  when we were trying to improve, we  asked our colleagues, all right,  let\u2019s  not terminate it; let\u2019s try and fix some  of the things that are not right.  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.  Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I yield  the gentlewoman an additional minute.  Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. Supporting  efforts  to  terminate  these  housing  assistance  programs means  turning your back on your own constituents.  Mr. Chairman, we have our disagreements. There\u2019s no two ways about it.  But with that being said, to judge a  program from the beginning when we  couldn\u2019t get servicers, now we are getting servicers, now we are getting people to be responsive on getting people  to stay in their homes.  And think about it: All these homes  that are being lost to families, where  are they supposed to go? In New York,  you can\u2019t find an apartment, so what  are we doing, making more people  homeless?  It was not the fault of the homeowners. I agree, there were many people  that  shouldn\u2019t  have  probably  bought a house for $700,000 or $800,000.  The majority of us here in Congress  couldn\u2019t even afford  something  like  that. They  should have never been  given a mortgage. All of us, when we  bought our homes, had to go through  the third degree. How much money do  you earn? Can you pay the insurance?  Can you pay your taxes?  That\u2019s why we also put legislation in  there to have the servicers help them.  Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, if I  might inquire how much time is remaining on both sides.  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from  Illinois has  191\u20442minutes  remaining.  The gentleman from Massachusetts has  23 minutes remaining.  Mrs. BIGGERT. I reserve the balance  of my time.  Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I yield  2 minutes to the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. CARNEY).  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise  today to oppose this ill-advised effort  to repeal the Home Affordable Modification Program. Instead, we ought to  be focusing on how we can move together, Democrats and Republicans, to  address the foreclosure crisis and keep  families in their homes.  Since the housing bubble burst, over  9 million Americans have gone  into  foreclosure. In my little State of Delaware, annual foreclosure filings nearly  tripled over the past few years. And we  aren\u2019t even one of the worst, hardest  hit States.  Now, one thing is clear. We can\u2019t help  every one of these homeowners. Every  situation is different; and, frankly, not  every homeowner can or  should be  helped. And most of the help should  come  from the banks and mortgage  servicers, but they are not doing nearly  enough in the State of Delaware.  What is incredible to me is that, with  the  HAMP  Termination  Act,  our  friends on the other side of the aisle  have decided not to help at all; and  that will mean a more direct path to  foreclosure for thousands of families.  The claim is that HAMP has hurt  more people than it has helped. That is  simply a ridiculous charge. Back in my  home State of Delaware, the HAMP  program has helped 1,600 homeowners,  by far the most effective government  program. That\u2019s  25  percent  of  the  homeowners who filed for foreclosure  last year.  And I know a little bit about this. I  served as the chair of the foreclosure  task force when I was lieutenant governor for over a year.  And the best course, the best result  we know is for the private banks, as I  said, and the servicers to make the  modifications necessary,  for the private sector to shoulder the bulk of the  burden. But they\u2019re just not doing it.  And so public officials need tools to  help out, and HAMP is one of the best  tools we have.  The real question here  is whether  you believe there is an appropriate role  for government at all to help homeowners facing foreclosure through no  fault of their own. It\u2019s okay to use taxpayers funds to bail out the banks, but  my friends on the other side don\u2019t want  to use a small amount to help homeowners.  Mrs. BIGGERT. I yield myself 30 seconds.  The gentleman from Delaware talks  about his State. Let me just say that  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:15 Mar 30, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K29MR7.011 H29MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",
            "14": "H2004  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE March 29, 2011  I filed this amendment during Sunshine Week, which highlights the importance of open government. In keeping with the spirit of transparency,  this amendment would include within  the bill the specific reasons why we  should end the failed HAMP program.  The HAMP program was designed to  assist between 3 and 4 million homeowners. However, as of February, only  607,000  active  permanent mortgage  modifications were made under HAMP.  While $30 billion was obligated by the  Treasury to HAMP, only $1.04 billion  has been disbursed. Furthermore, the  Special Inspector General for TARP reported that HAMP offers many homeowners  \u2018\u2018little more than  false hope  and in certain cases causes more harm  than good.\u2019\u2019 The program does not fulfill  its  intended purpose of helping  American homeowners. It delays rather  than prevents foreclosure.  This program was flawed from the beginning. According to The Wall Street  Journal, the number of applications  canceled far exceeds those that were  approved, and the number of applications continues to slow. I agree with  the Journal\u2019s assessment, which also  pointed out  that keeping people  in  homes they cannot afford is bad policy.  Incentivizing mortgage servicers to do  just that only exacerbates our housing  crisis. Moreover, the private sector is  better equipped to deal with the problem, and they have modified nearly  double the number of loans themselves  without government involvement.  My amendment concludes that ending this ineffective program would save  taxpayers $1.4 billion, which is according to the Congressional Budget Office.  This is one step toward restoring fiscal  discipline to our Federal Government.  Too often, our constituents receive  biased or  incomplete  information on  the issues we are discussing in Congress, thus making it difficult for them  to make informed assessments of our  work. Including additional facts on the  intended consequences of legislation is  beneficial to the public. That is why I  urge support for the Hanna amendment  and the underlying bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the amendment.  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  from  Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. ELLISON. I rise in opposition to  the  gentleman  from  New  York\u2019s  amendment and in opposition to the  underlying bill today.  Mr. Chairman, the middle class  is  shrinking, and deficits are rising because Republicans are giving a pass to  special interests who cheated American  homeowners and wrecked our economy.  This is the 13th week of the Republican-controlled Congress. Republicans  continue to ignore the people\u2019s top priority, which is jobs. Instead of working  to keep middle class families in their  homes, the Republican plan is to foreclose on the American middle class.  The American people sent us here to  protect the dream, not to destroy it,  not to perpetuate a Wall Street nightmare. Democrats are standing with the  American people to create good-paying  American jobs and to keep Americans  in their homes.  This legislation is just the latest attempt by the Republican majority to  end foreclosure programs to help middle class Americans. The majority\u2019s  housing plan is very simple: foreclose  on the middle class. Now that millions  of  families have already  lost  their  homes, their plan is to hand out foreclosure notices to everybody else.  What\u2019s the Republican answer if you  lose your home to foreclosure? So be it.  What\u2019s the Republican answer if your  neighbors lose their homes? So be it.  What\u2019s the Republican answer if you  lose your job? So be it.  Mr. Chair, I would like to yield 20  seconds to the gentleman  from New  York for a question. I am offering the  gentleman 20 seconds because I want to  ask him a question.  Does the gentleman want to answer  the question?  Mrs. BIGGERT. The gentleman is not  here.  Mr. ELLISON. How many jobs does  this amendment create?  Mrs. BIGGERT. This legislation is to  reiterate what the Congressional Budget Office says about\u2014\u2014  Mr. ELLISON. Reclaiming my time,  the gentlelady hasn\u2019t told me the jobs  that this amendment, this bill, is going  to create.  Mr. MCHENRY. Will the gentleman  yield?  Mr. ELLISON. I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.  How many jobs is this amendment  going to create or is this bill going to  create?  Mr. MCHENRY. Certainly, a multibillion-dollar Federal  program  doesn\u2019t  create any real private sector jobs.  Mr. ELLISON. I reclaim my time.  \u2018\u2018No  jobs\u2019\u2019  is the answer  from the  gentleman from North Carolina. I appreciate his candor.  Mr. MCHENRY. Will the gentleman  yield?  Mr. ELLISON. Let me  here.  Mr. MCHENRY.  If  the  gentleman  would yield, I would be happy to explain.  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  Minnesota controls the time.  Mr. ELLISON. We are here for the  specific purpose of  trying  to create  some jobs and to help the American  people create their own dreams. That\u2019s  about jobs. We\u2019ve been here 13 weeks,  and the majority caucus, Mr. Chair,  hasn\u2019t created one single job.  I asked the gentleman from North  Carolina how many jobs this bill is creating, and he just went off on a tangent  somewhere. Now, I\u2019m looking for some  kind of a number. I\u2019ll even take an estimate.  How many jobs does this bill create?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. MCHENRY. When you cut Federal spending, you create private sector  finish  just  from  jobs. When you tax people more, you  get less private sector growth.  Mr. ELLISON. I reclaim my time.  Look, we are supposed to be creating  jobs around here, Mr. Chair, and we\u2019re  not creating anything.  b1540  The fact is we get spin and we get  imaginary arguments and we get failed  and flawed economic theory but no answer  to  the  fundamental  question,  which is, when are the jobs going to  start arriving around here?  Mr. Chair, it is a pretty simple question: How many jobs does this bill create? How many families will this bill  help keep in their homes? In fact, Mr.  Chair, I have three major studies here  with me today which I would like to  enter into the RECORDwhich state very  clearly that the Republican spending  bill eliminates nearly 1 million jobs.  The Economic Policy Institute study  shows that the Republican spending  bill, H.R. 1, will cut nearly 1 million  American jobs. Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s  Analytics  said  that  the Republican  spending bill will cut 1 million jobs. A  report from Goldman Sachs says that  the Republican spending bill will cut  nearly 1 million jobs.  Why  is  the Republican majority  against jobs? Why won\u2019t they take a  moment to do something about jobs?  [From the Economic Policy Institute, Feb. 9,  2011]  REPUBLICANPROPOSALTO\u2018RIGHTOURFISCAL  SHIP\u2019 THROWSMOREWORKERSOVERBOARD  (By Rebecca Thiess)  Update: Since this piece was posted last  week, the magnitude of discretionary funding cuts for the duration of this fiscal year  proposed by House Republican leadership has  grown substantially, especially considering  the short time frame for implementation.  After the House Appropriations Committee  detailed $74 billion in cuts last Wednesday, a  number of conservative members demanded  $26 billion in additional cuts to make good  on the  \u2018\u2018Pledge to America,\u2019\u2019 bringing the  total  level of cuts  relative  to President  Obama\u2019s FY 2011 budget request to $100 billion. A full $100 billion cut to discretionary  spending would likely result in job losses on  the order of 994,000, using OMB\u2019s GDP projections (CBO\u2019s projections are based on current  law) and assuming a fiscal multiplier of 1.5.  The new GOP budget proposes cutting non-  security discretionary spending by $81 billion  relative to the president\u2019s $478 billion request  for  2011. Non-security discretionary  cuts of this magnitude would likely result in  job losses of just over 800,000. (2/15/2011)  Today  the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee released a list of 70 proposed funding cuts to government operations  for the rest of fiscal year 2011. The cuts included in the committee\u2019s proposal are extensive in both their depth and reach. In  total, House Republicans propose funding the  government at a  level  $74 billion below  President Obama\u2019s FY 2011 budget request.  Of that cut, $58 billion (over three-quarters)  would apply to non-security discretionary  spending.  Included on the chopping block are a $224  million cut to Amtrak, a $256 million cut in  assistance to state and local law enforcement, an $889 million cut for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, a $1  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:48 Mar 30, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K29MR7.025 H29MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",
            "22": "H2012  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE March 29, 2011  study and legislative recommendations  for a new mortgage modification program that could more successfully and  effectively achieve the original purpose  of the Home Affordable Modification  Program.  We have to thank the administration  for recognizing that people were literally on their knees. There is no doubt  that we have different philosophies. My  friends on the other side of the aisle,  they keep talking about the deficit and  the depressing aspect of the $1 trillion  debt. We keep talking about invest and  grow the economy. When you grow the  economy, you have the ability to pay  down on your debt; you have the ability to address the question of the debt  ceiling.  So my  question  is: Why  wouldn\u2019t you want to know the best  practices?  Let me give you some of the myths  that have been presented. One suggestion is that this legislation that we  have before us to end the HAMP program will prevent another $30 billion  from going to one of these programs.  That is inaccurate. The repeal of this  program will,  in essence,  save only  $1.437 billion. That is all that it will  save. But, more importantly, what you  will have is you will throw homeowners  into the streets when the major asset  for Americans, middle  class,  hardworking Americans,  is  their home.  Let\u2019s find out the best practices and  make this work.  The monthly rate of new loan approvals would have to triple in order to  approximate the amount cited by the  chairman  of  this  committee,  suggesting $30 billion. Actually, we expect  the rates are, instead, likely to modestly decline. So you are not going to  have that much savings and it is not  going to, in essence, blow up with so  many people using  it  that you are  going to use this amount of money.  One Republican has suggested that  the program goes to private lenders.  Well, for every dollar that the HAMP  program has  paid  out, homeowners  have received from lenders $5 in reduced mortgage payments. Most of the  program funds do not go to lenders but  go directly to homeowners as incentives on the on-time mortgage payments. It is giving individuals a leg up.  It is interesting that we would not  want to  focus on the best practices  when, if you look at this map, you will  see that every single State has received  a HAMP impact, someone has a mortgage problem that the HAMP program  has helped.  Now, can we fix it? Yes, we can make  it better. But let me tell you about a  person by the name of Laurel. She indicated how this program has helped her.  \u2018\u2018Well, my income has not fully come  back.\u2019\u2019 She was unemployed.  \u2018\u2018I am  making much less than I was making  before, so it has been a difficult time.  With the modification, my mortgage  payment has gone down $800 and I am  able to make my payment on time. I  have been able to remain in the home  that I love, and that has provided me  with great stability. I am extremely  grateful that I received the modification.\u2019\u2019  She has saved an asset that contributes to the economy. What would be  the result of ending the modification  program? I can tell you what the result  would be. The result would be that  Laurel would dump another home onto  the market that no one could buy, that  would bring down the quality of the  neighborhood and the house appraisal  prices of the neighborhood and, therefore, add another dent to the economy.  Invest and grow. And the question is,  all of my friends who are there on the  other side of the aisle, here is a document that is 15 pages long that shows  that your district, your cities, have  been impacted positively by the HAMP  program. Job growth is picking up. Invest  and  grow  jobs  should  be  the  mindset of the American Congress, for  that  is what we were sent back to  Washington to do.  There is no doubt that we have a collective commitment to bringing down  the debt. There is a collective commitment to doing that, and we can look  reasonably at what and how to do it.  But when you don\u2019t even have the best  practices or know why you are repealing something, and right now people  are in the middle of addressing this  question of modifying their mortgage.  I ask my colleagues to support my  amendment because it does in fact provide a lifeline, and it invests in the  economy, creates  jobs and stabilizes  the middle class.  With regard to the HAMP program, I would  like say, \u2018\u2018Mend it, don\u2019t end it!\u2019\u2019  The HAMP program has not been perfect,  but  it has helped a considerable number of  Americans modify their mortgages in order to  prevent foreclosure and keep their homes and  livelihoods that they work so hard for day in  and day out.  The White  House  agrees\u2014The White  House has  indicated  that  the President will  veto the HAMP termination bill if it passes.  As written, this bill would prohibit new mortgage loan modifications under the Home Affordable Modification Program, (HAMP), which  is funded under authority generally referred to  as TARP, pursuant to the \u2018\u2018Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008\u2019\u2019 (also known  as EESA). Despite termination of the program,  this bill would grandfather  in assistance  to  homeowners who, prior to the date of enactment, had already been extended an offer to  participate in HAMP, either on a permanent or  trial basis.  I am here before you  today  to offer an  amendment that I believe will greatly enhance  this bill by making it a vehicle that providing  us, the Members of Congress, with very useful  information. If H.R. 839 were to pass, terminating  the HAMP program, my amendment  would call on the Secretary of the Treasury to  commission a study that would identify what  aspects of the HAMP program were successful and effectively carried out the original intent  of the program.  It would then require the Secretary to issue  a  report  to Congress containing all  findings  and determinations of the study, and legislative  recommendations  for a new mortgage  modification program that could more successfully and effectively achieve the original purpose of the Home Affordable Modification Program.  Parliamentarian ruled that the amendment is  germane.  Congressional Budget Office, CBO,  found  that  there  is no  cost associated with my  amendment.  If the HAMP program is terminated, we will  still be left to deal with the problem of foreclosed homes in a recovering, yet very fragile,  housing market. With the unemployment rate  still hovering at an uncomfortably high rate,  Americans are still dealing with the difficulties  of making ends meet. Although our economy  is slowly but surely on the path to recovery,  Americans struggling to find work will still be  faced with  the painful  reality of  losing  their  home, although now, without an avenue  for  assistance with refinancing.  To avoid another slump in the housing market, and to avoid dealing yet another blow to  our fragile economy, if H.R. 839 becomes law,  it will be necessary for us to consider a new  mortgage refinance and modification program  in the future to prevent stalling the recovery of  the housing market, or even worse, allowing it  to crumble once again.  If  that day were  to  come,  it would be most useful  to have  firm  facts and strong statistics about what methods  are proven to be most effective in solving the  problems  associated with  high  foreclosure  rates and ensuring that home loan modifications are both permanent and successful.  The HAMP program was put in place by the  Obama Administration in early 2009 with the  intent to modify mortgage loans in order that  distressed  borrowers might  have  a  better  chance at making payments and holding onto  their homes. The program has successfully  modified over 500,000 million mortgages  to  prevent foreclosure and keep homeowners in  their homes. While well intentioned HAMP program has encountered some difficulties\u2014not  yet reaching the goal set by the Obama Administration of helping 3  to 4 million homeowners.  Nonetheless,  the program has effectively  helped a number of homeowners with successful loan modifications that allowed them to  keep their homes. To date, there are 539,493  homeowners with  permanent HAMP  loan  modifications.  New permanent HAMP modifications have  averaged around 29,000 per month over the  last six months of 2010. Therefore, assuming  a modestly declining rate from this, a reasonable estimate is that program participation will  double by the end of next year, for a cumulative total of 1.1 million homeowners. Based  on this estimate, the bill would deny modifications to more than a half million homeowners  at risk of foreclosure.  This  is a sign,  that despite  its problems,  there are some positive and effective aspects  of the HAMP program that should be considered when we look to replace the HAMP program  if H.R. 839  is passed  terminating  this  program. My amendment would call for a detailed study  that would highlight  these best  practices, while also ensuring that those aspects of the program which may have hampered its initial success are not repeated.  There are a number of reasons the program  has not met the original Obama Administration  goal of helping 3  to 4 million homeowners,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:13 Mar 30, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\K29MR7.043 H29MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",

Mr. LARSEN of Washington (during  the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  to dispense with  the  reading.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there  objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington?  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. LARSEN  of Washington. Mr.  Speaker,  this  amendment  does  one  simple thing:  It  continues  the Home Affordable  Modification Program for members of  the Armed Forces and Gold Star recipients.  Mr. Speaker, we all know the Home  Affordable Modification Program has  not performed to the original projections, but this is an effort that has provided 600,000 permanent loan modifications. Six hundred thousand American  families are still in their homes because of this effort. I doubt these families would tell you it is not working.  Mr. Speaker, some will say that terminating  this program won\u2019t affect  those who have already received modifications or are working  through a  modification currently. Yet many more  families still need help, especially military and gold star families.  Even though the economy is beginning to recover, the housing market is  still  struggling. HAMP  is  currently  helping 30,000 additional families every  month.  I would prefer that we keep this effort going for everyone. But if we are  not about to, at a minimum we need to  preserve this program for active military and gold star families.  Regardless of how anyone feels about  the underlying legislation and regardless of how anybody feels about the  funding for the original legislation, we  can all agree that we owe our men and  women in uniform a tremendous debt  of gratitude for their service and sacrifice. While defending our country,  servicemembers should not be afraid  that their families will lose the roof  over their heads, but that\u2019s the very  situation in which a Navy sailor found  himself last year as part of Operation  Enduring Freedom.  Seven  thousand miles  from home,  there was little he could do to help his  spouse balance the stress of raising two  children, of her work, and of household  expenses. To top it off, their mortgage  was about to jump to almost $2,300 a  month. But this family was able to find  relief in the Home Affordable Modification Program. They applied for a trial  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:48 Mar 30, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A29MR7.029 H29MRPT1         ",
            "38": "H2028  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE March 29, 2011  Mr. STEVEKING onto the floor and it bursts, it\u2019s got  mercury vapor in it\u2014and some other  nasty stuff I don\u2019t even know what it  is\u2014and all of a sudden you\u2019ve got to  call the hazardous material team to  come in in hoods and suits and do a  hazmat removal of that broken light  bulb.  Now I\u2019m sorry. I like to say that one  of the things that we have a real shortage of in America, especially the America that\u2019s inside the Beltway in Washington, D.C., is common sense. But to  put a hazardous material light bulb in  to correct something that you have  against a normal  light bulb because  you think it burns too much power is  really not very cost efficient.  I am very pleased to see my friend,  from Iowa, drift  in  here. If the gentleman has anything he  wants to talk about here tonight, I  would be glad to yield him some time.  Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentleman  from Texas, the good  judge,  who has taught me a few things about  all of this. One of those things is sitting on the Judiciary Committee with  the gentleman  from Texas  is, and I  haven\u2019t  learned  it very well, but at  least I saw the demonstration on how  to listen. One of the common denominators of the judges from Texas that  we have serving  in this Congress  is  they are all good listeners. They also  have heard a lot of stories, some the  truth and some not, and they sort that  out pretty well.  When I hear Judge CARTERcome to  the floor to tell us how it is, I\u2019m pretty  confident that he has listened really  carefully and drawn a judgment as to  what\u2019s the truth and what isn\u2019t and  boiled it down to the essential facts of  Constitution  and  law  and  common  sense and rendered a verdict. So as I  hear this verdict emerging here from  the presentation this evening, it calls  me to the floor to say thank you to the  gentleman from Texas for bringing this  up, for all the times that you\u2019ve come  to the floor and sometimes fought a  lonely battle that turned out to stand  on a good cause.  That\u2019s the way good things get started. It\u2019s usually one person starting this  out and then truth seems to attract  more people to a truthful and good and  a just cause. I am interested in the  gentleman\u2019s presentation here and not  particularly informed but I came to listen. I would be happy to continue my  listening.  Mr. CARTER. I will reclaim my time.  I am just about through. I just wanted  to point out, I don\u2019t have anything  against fluorescent light bulbs. I\u2019ve got  a  few  fluorescent  light bulbs  in my  workshop out in the garage, mainly because they just gave me more light for  less money, not because of the electricity. But I made that choice. I think  that\u2019s fine. If people want to choose to  have all fluorescent light bulbs in their  house, I think that\u2019s great. That\u2019s the  America we  love. But I don\u2019t think  NANCYPELOSIor anybody else in this  House of Representatives ought to be  telling us what kind of light bulbs we  have to have. It doesn\u2019t make sense.  It\u2019s not fair to you. You are a person of  independent will. You are granted liberty and freedom by your Constitution,  the Constitution of the United States,  and those are just recording God-given  rights and privileges. I don\u2019t see why  we think we are the center of the universe for knowledge in this House to  come up and tell you what kind of light  bulbs you can have. Or what kind of energy that you can consume. Unless it  comes out to be against the national  interest. And I would argue right now  with all  the alternative energy, we  haven\u2019t got anything to replace what  we\u2019re using right now yet. But keep  working on it and then we\u2019ll let us  make the choice, let the American citizens make the choice as to what they  want to do. I think that\u2019s good freedom. That\u2019s good liberty. That\u2019s what  we are all about in this country, and  that\u2019s why we prosper, because we give  the individual the right to make his  own choices. If he chooses to do something that harms others, we can put a  stop to that. That\u2019s why we have laws.  But if he doesn\u2019t, if he just wants to  live his life the way he wants to live it,  we don\u2019t have any business telling the  individual how to live his life. And I  would argue this stupid light bulb rule  is one of those things. I will argue that  until  it  is  imposed completely as a  mandate sometime next fall, I think.  And then I guess the light bulb police  will be coming after me.  But, seriously, this  is the kind of  things that we do by regulation, or impose our will on others, and in many  instances it is done by bureaucrats who  sit in Washington, D.C., and they probably have never even seen that plow  that we just saw in that farm, except  maybe they\u2019ve seen it on television.  But they\u2019ve certainly not seen anybody  out there sweating on an Iowa farm or  a Texas farm operating what looks like  is a disc harrow that\u2019s turning the soil  there. And yet they\u2019re writing regulations to regulate this man\u2019s life. Maybe  they\u2019re the right thing to do, but you  wonder when they have one and they  come up with another one that you  have to still meet the first one, stack  the second one on top of  it, and  it  clearly serves no purpose.  These are all the kind of arguments  that frustrate you. They\u2019re the kind of  things that make the average businessman, the average farmer, rancher, decide to hold off on investing in America  because he wants to know what America he\u2019s investing in, he or she is investing in. That is the real issue that is  driving the fact that we are still sitting here right around 9 percent unemployment after all these months, over  25 months, we\u2019re sitting here with the  same 8.9, which is as close to 9 as I  want to get percent unemployment because the Americans that create the  jobs are concerned about what\u2019s next.  I yield to the gentleman from Iowa.  Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentleman from Texas.  As I listen to this presentation, a  number of things occur to me about  what happens when you have the Federal agencies and the Federal agencies  are passing rules and regulations that  even though there is a broad authority  that\u2019s granted to those agencies by this  Congress, some of the things that they  do are beyond the imagination of the  people that debated or voted for the  bill in the first place.  I look at the Clean Water Act and the  Endangered Species Act, which  are  more than 30 years old by now. They\u2019ve  turned into something way beyond the  imagination of the people that passed  them. The environmentalists that supported them then seemed to be on the  edge of what would be considered mainstream. Looking back on that, they  would be considered mainstream now.  But the problem that we have, and particularly with EPA, would be that the  mothers and fathers of the EPA employees  that  first  implemented  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the Clean  Water Act and the Endangered Species  Act, now their children have picked  this up and others from outside, a second generation of people.  b2040  They have come into these professions now with\u2014like many young people do\u2014and it\u2019s a very good thing to be  idealistic and have a sense of a cause\u2014  but if you look at a law that was written in 1978, and you apply it with a vision of having a cause that you want to  be championed for in 2011, quite often  the  second  generation  environmentalist  is  something entirely different than the first generation environmentalist. And they will interpret  the  law and write rules beyond the  scope of the imagination of those who  drafted it and ratified it and the President that signed it.  And so I deal with things back in an  environmental  perspective,  having  spent my life\u2019s work in the soil conservation business. We have gone out  and done some drainage work. Mostly,  it\u2019s been surface work, permanent practices\u2014terraces, dams, and waterways\u2014  and I\u2019ve envisioned that we would want  to send all the raindrops down through  the soil profile to purify that water in  nature\u2019s  intended way and keep the  soil  from washing down stream and  ending up in the Gulf of Mexico.  And yet the regulations that come  from some of the EPA initiatives are  things such as\u2014I can think of protected streams, an issue that came to  many States, but it came to Iowa. It  was one of the things that drew me  into political life. They wrote a rule  that said that these waters for these  streams, these 115 streams that were  designed to be protected for their natural riparian beauty, to quote the rule,  some of them were drainage ditches  that I had floated and walked those  streams all through western Iowa. And  some of those streams were just drainage ditches. There was no natural riparian  left-over beauty because they  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:48 Mar 30, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K29MR7.080 H29MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",

            "54": "S1910  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE March 29, 2011  If we pass the second-degree amendment,  quite  simply, what we have  voted yes to do is delay the repeal of  the 1099 amendment and eventually we  are going to flirt with disaster on this  and it will not get done.  We need to focus all our energy on  helping our job creators grow and create more jobs, not force them into worrying about hiring more accountants.  Pardon my boldness but there is no  reason to delay. An identical version of  my amendment passed the House with  large bipartisan support: 314 to 112. I  urge my colleagues, with all I have, to  oppose the second-degree amendment  my  friend  from New Jersey  is proposing.  Let\u2019s be clear. This latest distraction  from 1099 repeal is just that\u2014it is a distraction. We all know it is not truly  about a study to look at health care  costs. If we want to do a study, put the  amendment on some other piece of legislation. This is about derailing and delaying the 1099 repeal because if the  second-degree  amendment  passes,  it  says: Instead of sending this to the  President to become law, we need to go  back to the drawing board.  While the proponents of the second-  degree amendment will claim it is innocuous, make no mistake, it is designed to obliterate this amendment  because of a budgetary offset. Again, I  remind us, a similar offset was passed  unanimously recently by the Senate.  Just like a Politico article from yesterday noted: \u2018\u2018Senate Democrats are  working on an amendment that could  kill the [Republicans\u2019 pay-for in the future].\u2019\u2019  If the second degree passes, then we  are essentially adding nearly $25 billion  to our debt over the next 10 years.  While some may preach the virtues of  pay-as-you-go  rules, when  it  comes  right down to it, they will undermine  virtually any fiscally responsible pay-  for.  So here we are again crossing the  same bridge we have crossed so many  times before. In fact, the Senate refused this idea when we rejected the  Baucus amendment that repealed 1099  but was not paid for. That amendment  fell 23 votes short of passage because it  fiscally did not make sense.  So why are we still here aimlessly  walking around  in circles when we  ought to be marching straight ahead?  Why are we proposing to send this bipartisan legislation back to the House?  Because that is what will have to happen, when it ought to go directly to the  President\u2019s desk for signature.  Our vote today can send a message  that we have all the votes necessary to  get this done and get it on the President\u2019s desk and everybody can celebrate: our job creators, Democrats, Republicans, Independents.  The  logic  of  the  second-degree  amendment is absolutely baffling. Here  we are in the ninth inning and somehow our pay-for has become magically  unacceptable, even after a similar pay-  for was approved unanimously by the  Senate before. Where were all the objections? Where was the demand  for  further study when we unanimously  approved a similar offset for the doc fix  legislation?  Let me be very clear: A vote in favor  of the second degree is a vote against  our  business  and  job  creators. My  amendment has been waiting for a vote  for 14 days now, and the repeal has  been pending for nearly 1 year. Isn\u2019t  enough enough?  The time for delay and further study  must be over. Let\u2019s pass my amendment today by an overwhelming vote  of the Senate. Let\u2019s reject the second  degree. Let\u2019s get this piece of legislation to the President for his signature  and we can all celebrate. Small businesses, our  job creators, deserve no  less.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.  f  GOVERNMENT SPENDING  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President,  government  funding  is set to expire  next week on April 8. We are in the  midst of the 2011 fiscal year that ends  September 30, and the Congress has  only appropriated money through April  8. If Congress does not act by that  time,  the  government  would  shut  down.  Congress needs to act, but Congress  needs to listen to the American people  and  listen  to  the  financial  experts  whom we have dealt with and reduce  spending and reduce the surging deficit  we face this year, last predicted to be  $1.4  trillion. Nothing has ever been  seen like it before, and it has to be addressed. There is no way around it.  So we have this deadline hanging  over our heads, and the reason is, my  colleagues in the Democratic leadership in the Senate will not agree to the  kind of substantial but realistic spending reductions the House of Representatives has sent to us. The House has  sent us a budget plan that I think will  work. But what we hear is, the sky will  fall if we trim the $61 billion from a  $3.7 trillion budget\u2014$3,700 billion that  we spend\u2014if we reduce that spending  by $61 billion, somehow this will cause  the country to sink into oblivion.  The American people know better  than that. That  is not realistic. Of  course, we can cut those kinds of numbers out of this huge budget we have,  and the American people will be better  off for it.  As ranking member on the Budget  Committee, I have looked at the numbers, and that $61 billion reduces the  baseline of Federal spending by $61 billion this year, but over 10 years\u2014because  it  is a baseline  reduction\u2014it  would save $860 billion. This is the kind  of small but significant step that does  make a difference.  People say: It does not make any difference. Why don\u2019t we  just  increase  spending? Why do we cut spending at  all? Of course, we have to reduce spending. The American people know the  borrowed money and overspending of  the past 2 years have failed to produce  what it promised. Instead, all that has  been achieved  through  this massive  surge in Federal spending, through the  stimulus package and other programs,  is a crushing debt burden that weakens  our economy and is a drag on our economy, as expert witnesses have told us.  It threatens our economic future. Alan  Simpson, former Republican Senator,  and Erskine Bowles, formerly the Chief  of Staff to President Clinton, were appointed by President Obama to cochair  the debt commission. The fiscal commission  reported  to us, and  jointly  they submitted a written statement  that said if the United States fails to  act, it faces \u2018\u2018the most predictable economic crisis in its history.\u2019\u2019 This is a  real warning. They said such a crisis  could arrive in as soon as 1 or 2 years.  People have been saying: Oh, we are  on the wrong track. If we do not get off  it, in 3 or 4 or 5 years, we are going to  have a crisis. More and more people are  warning us that crisis is sooner. Mr.  Bowles said: In 1 year, give or take a  little bit, we will have a crisis. Mr.  Simpson said: I think within 1 year.  The American people rightly expect  their elected leaders to confront this  threat with  seriousness and candor.  But  the President  has  never  once  looked the American people in the eyes  and told them the truth about the financial crisis we face. Has he ever discussed those kinds of words with the  American people, that we face an actual crisis? We could have a debt problem that hits us very quickly, just like  the one in 2008 that put us in a deep recession. We are in a fragile recovery  now, and we need to keep that recovery  going. The last thing we need to do is  have another recession, or some sort of  other financial collapse that puts more  people out of work and weakens an already struggling economy.  It  is not  necessary this occur.  The President and his Budget Director have, instead of being truthful with  us,  falsely boasted to the American  people that under their budget we will  \u2018\u2018live within our means\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018not add  more to the debt\u2019\u2019 and that \u2018\u2018we\u2019re not  going to spend any more money than  we\u2019re taking in.\u2019\u2019 He submitted his 10-  year budget to the Congress, and that  is what he says his budget will do. But  not one of those statements is true\u2014  not one.  When the budget was announced, Mr.  Bowles, whom the President appointed  to head the debt commission, said it is  nowhere close to what we need to be  doing to get our house in order. In fact,  the Congressional Budget Office finds  this: that our annual deficits never  once fall below $748 billion. I was saying $600 billion before based on the  President\u2019s estimates of his budget.  Now the Congressional Budget Office  has done an  independent analysis of  the President\u2019s budget, and they say  the lowest single annual deficit, in 10  years, would be $748 billion.

            "62": "S1918  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE March 29, 2011  And all four of us fought for myriad  causes, most especially those affecting  America\u2019s women. Looking  back,  I  take enormous pride, as I know both  Senators MIKULSKIand BOXERdo, that  we spoke as women first, not as Republicans  or Democrats,  that women\u2019s  issues transcended partisan  lines  for  us. The fact was, we just couldn\u2019t afford to draw partisan lines with women  underrepresented in Congress. And that  idea is what drove our agenda at the bipartisan  Congressional  Caucus  for  Women\u2019s Issues, which I cochaired for  over 10 years  in the House of Representatives  and  where  Geraldine  Ferarro was also at the vanguard in  amplifying issues for literally generations of women.  Our adherence to working together\u2014  and to the ideal of principle over politics\u2014became our foundation. We determined if we didn\u2019t act, who would? And  we started to make a difference  for  women, and not a moment too soon. Indeed, there was indeed a time in America when our laws specifically worked  against women, when economic equality pertained only to economic equality among men\u2014not women, when our  laws didn\u2019t reflect the changing, dual  responsibilities of women who were increasingly working as well as caring  for a family.  Well, we weren\u2019t going to accept the  status quo any longer, and certainly  Geraldine was not one to ever countenance the notion of \u2018\u2018that\u2019s just the  way it is.\u2019\u2019 To the contrary. We confronted  these disparities  for women  head on and introduced a package of  laws that opened the doors of economic  opportunity for the women of America  by revising laws and giving women the  tools required to succeed. That package was the multifaceted Economic Equity Act. Among a litany of provisions,  we called for a study of the government\u2019s pay practices, sought to ensure  equal credit for women in business ventures, and battled with Geraldine Ferraro who led the effort to end pension  award discrimination against women  who were discovering upon their husband\u2019s  death  that, unbeknownst  to  them, they had been left with absolutely no pension benefits.  And in a group of women legislators  that was not, shall we say, comprised  of shrinking violets, no one gave greater voice to these issues, no one demonstrated more passion in their advocacy, and no one pressed for remedies  to right these wrongs with more verve  or skill than Geraldine Ferraro. She  was a bulwark against injustice and a  cherished champion for fairness in an  America where women were increasing  their roles in American life and their  presence  in the U.S. workplace and  economy.  On a personal note, I can\u2019t help but  think that part of our mutual bond was  that we  came  from  similar  backgrounds. Our  families  immigrated to  this great land\u2014hers from Italy and  mine from Greece. Our heritages spoke  to the very best of our Nation\u2019s mosaic  and the American dream where anything is possible and the only limits  you have are those you place on yourself. Indeed, the New York Times mentions  how Geraldine\u2019s mother  crocheted beads on wedding dresses  to  send her to the best schools. My Aunt  Mary worked the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.  night shift at a textile mill in Lewiston, ME, to earn money to ensure my  cousins and  I  received a good education. Although Geraldine and I didn\u2019t  agree on everything, we shared an unequivocal determination  to make a  lasting difference on issues for women  and  working  families\u2014an  unerring  focus  that  surmounted  politics  and  party labels.  Not surprisingly, more than 30 years  later,  Geraldine\u2019s  legacy  lives  on  through  the  74 women  serving  the  other body today, as well as the 17  women currently serving in the Senate.  How fitting it is that on the Monday  after she passed away, my 16 Senate  women colleagues and I submitted a  resolution  advocating  for  women\u2019s  rights in North Africa and the Middle  East. We have the moral high ground  in that clarion call in no small part because of Geraldine\u2019s historic leadership  and legacy.  In closing, I can\u2019t help but recall the  great Lady Astor, who was the first  woman to ever serve  in the British  House of Parliament. In fact, on the  day she took her seat in that distinguished body, a Member of Parliament  turned to her and said, \u2018\u2018Welcome to  the most exclusive men\u2019s club in Europe.\u2019\u2019 Demonstrating  the  kind  of  moxie and  sense of obligation  that  were hallmarks of America\u2019s Geraldine  Ferraro, Lady Astor  responded  \u2018\u2018it  won\u2019t be exclusive for long.\u2019\u2019 she said.  \u2018\u2018When I came in, I left the door wide  open!\u2019\u2019  Geraldine Ferraro espoused and exemplified what Lady Astor so memorably  articulated\u2014that  it  is  not  enough to break old barriers and chart  a new course, you have to ensure that  others are able to traverse it as well.  Geraldine spent a lifetime making certain that the path she helped pave was  available  and  accessible  to  every  woman with the courage and will to  travel it. And so, today, it is a privilege for me to extol this remarkable  woman whose indelible imprint upon  the political and public policy arenas  will be felt for generations to come.  At this most difficult of times, our  thoughts and prayers remain with her  husband of 50 years, John\u2014as well as  their children, Donna, John Jr., and  Laura and Geraldine\u2019s grandchildren.  May they be comforted by the knowledge that so many share in their profound sense of loss, as well as the memory of a trailblazing woman who, above  all else, was an adoring and beloved  mother and grandmother who leaves an  indelible mark upon her family, as well  as an entire Nation.  Thank you, Madam President.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I  know we are about to recess, but I wish  to take a minute or two to add my  voice to all the women in the Senate  who have been here today and thank  the Presiding Officer for her leadership  for encouraging us to honor Geraldine  Ferraro.  I remember being on the floor of the  1984 Democratic Convention when she  gave her acceptance  speech  for  the  Vice President of the United States,  and it was electric listening to her. It  epitomized for me, and I am sure every  woman  there,  the  fact  that women  could do anything.  Geraldine Ferraro worked tirelessly  on behalf of human rights and women\u2019s  rights around the globe. She dedicated  her public service to the ideals of respect and equality and she lived a career that called on all women to challenge the glass ceilings of the world. I  think it is particularly important because just because one woman breaks  the glass ceiling doesn\u2019t mean opportunities are open to every woman, and  she understood that and continued to  encourage all the ceilings across the  world to be broken for women.  Gerry\u2019s life was a powerful example  for all of us who are honoring her  today and for our daughters and granddaughters. We thank her for leading  the way. She will be missed.  Thank you. I yield the floor.  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President,  I rise today to reflect on the life and  legacy of Geraldine Ferraro who lost  her heroic battle with cancer on Saturday.  Geraldine Ferraro was first elected to  public  office  in  1978  to  represent  Queens in the U.S. House of Representatives.  As a member of the Public Works and  Transportation Committee, she pushed  to  improve mass  transit around La  Guardia Airport.  Later, she would cosponsor the Economic Equity Act, which was intended  to accomplish many of the aims of the  never-ratified equal rights amendment.  In 1984, former Vice President and a  distinguished Member of  this body,  Walter Mondale, chose Gerry to join  him as his Vice Presidential running  mate, the first woman to be placed on  a national ticket.  I was privileged  to  serve as  the  mayor of San Francisco in 1984 where  the Democratic Party held its convention that election year.  Twenty-seven years later, as I look  back on that time, I realize what an  important and historical moment her  selection was to American politics.  I recall the emotion and enthusiasm  of  people\u2014men  and women\u2014at  the  Moscone Center in San Francisco when  Gerry took the podium.  Sixty-four years after women won  the right to vote, Geraldine Ferraro  represented a new beginning  for our  politics. It was an amazing feeling.  While  the  election  didn\u2019t  go  the  Democrats\u2019 way that year, Gerry\u2019s selection was a victory for a generation  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:03 Mar 30, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G29MR6.021 S29MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",
            "70": "S1926  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE March 29, 2011  able to do by regulation what the legislators are unwilling to do by legislation.  This issue was discussed last year\u2014  the cap-and-trade law that passed the  House  in  the  last Congress. People  around America looked at it and said  that higher prices were not the way to  get more efficient energy policies. The  way to get more efficient energy policies  is to  look  for ways to produce  more American energy, to have a marketplace that has more choices than  the ones we have now. As people looked  at this issue, they said: Let\u2019s find more  American energy of all kinds, and let\u2019s  be conservationists and encourage that  we use that energy as efficiently as  possible, and let\u2019s also be out there researching and investing in the future  so that we know what we want our energy picture to look like a generation  from now\u2014not that we blindly rush in  and think high prices will solve our energy problems.  We all know that the President of the  United States, before the election in  2008, in talking to the editorial board  of the San Francisco Chronicle, made  the comment that under his energy  policies,  energy  prices would  necessarily skyrocket. The President has  looked  at  this  economy  closely\u2014I  hope\u2014over the last 2 years of his Presidency, and clearly every signal from  the administration now is that they  have concerns about $4-a-gallon gasoline, even though there are people in  that advisory group who at one time  said gas prices should be as high as the  gas prices in Europe and that is the  way to solve our use of gasoline. We  don\u2019t live in Europe. We live in a country that is large, expansive, and requires travel and commerce. So high  gas prices are not the answer to our  transportation problems, and higher  utility bills are not the answer to our  energy problems.  In fact, as people looked at the potential of cap and trade on utility bills,  they looked at how much of our utilities come from coal. Of course, cap and  trade\u2014and the EPA regulations that  would try to impose cap and trade by  regulation\u2014cap and trade is particularly  focused on coal-based utilities.  From the middle of Pennsylvania to  the western edge of Wyoming, 50 percent of the electricity in the country  comes  from coal. Mr. President,  in  your State and my State, a significant  majority of the electricity comes from  coal. In Missouri, it is 82 percent of the  electricity that comes from coal.  In our State, the utility providers  got  together\u2014the  rural  electric  cooperatives, the municipal utilities, the  privately owned and publicly owned\u2014  and funded a study with which nobody  ever  found  fault. Nobody has  challenged the study. In that study, in our  State the average utility bill would go  up about 80 percent in the first 10 years  under cap and trade. It would come  close to doubling in the first 12 years.  For many utility customers, it would  double. If the average bill is going to  go up 80 percent, for many customers  out there, their bill would double in 10  years, and for the average customer, it  would double in about a dozen years.  Who benefits from that?  At a hearing the other day with the  EPA Administrator, I talked about a  visit I had last fall with someone who  explained to me that he was an hourly  employee at a company\u2014by that point,  with the discussion of cap and trade,  almost all Missourians knew our utility bills would double  in about  10  years\u2014and he said: If my utility bill  doubles, that is a bad thing. If my retired mother\u2019s bill doubles,  that  is  worse. If the utility bill at work doubles and my job goes away, then the  other bills don\u2019t matter that much because I can\u2019t pay mine and help my  mom pay hers.  That individual has a Ph.D. in common sense, if not economics. That is  what happens if we allow these bills to  go up. Because of that discussion, I  stand here today absolutely confident  that,  in the  foreseeable  future, Congress will not impose that penalty on  our economy. If the Congress won\u2019t impose that penalty on our economy, we  should not let regulators impose that  penalty on our economy.  What  the McConnell  amendment  does\u2014again, with  the hard work of  Senators INHOFE, BARRASSO, and others\u2014is simply redefine the authority or  maybe reemphasize the definition Congress thought it was giving the Environmental Protection Agency, and it  says: You can\u2019t regulate these greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. It  doesn\u2019t stop the Clean Air Act\u2019s provisions to protect clean air in every way  that was anticipated until the recent  determination that somehow EPA had  the authority to also regulate greenhouse gases, but it does refocus the  EPA on the intention of the Clean Air  Act, not their expansion of the Clean  Air Act.  By the way, the EPA has no ability  to expand the Clean Air Act. That is  the job of the Congress of the United  States. Fine, if we want to have that  debate. In fact, we had that debate last  year. The House passed a bill  that  would have done what the EPA\u2019s new  sense of their own mission would do,  and I think the American people spoke  pretty loudly about that. Because of  that, the last Congress didn\u2019t pass that  bill. The House  of Representatives  passed a bill, but the Senate didn\u2019t pass  that bill. This Congress isn\u2019t going to  pass that bill either, and I would predict that the next Congress won\u2019t pass  that bill.  Why won\u2019t they pass the bill? Why  won\u2019t we pass a bill in this Congress?  Why won\u2019t the next Congress pass a  bill? They know it has a devastating  impact on our economy; and if the Congress doesn\u2019t want there to be a devastating impact on our economy, we  also shouldn\u2019t want the Environmental  Protection Agency  to do  something  that would have a devastating impact  on our economy.  In fact, when we look at the economies around the world, the economies  that have the greatest problems with  air and water are the economies that  failed; the economies where, at some  point,  those  countries  decide,  ultimately, they are going to do whatever  it takes to get back to where they can  have jobs that allow families to live.  The EPA  is bound, and should be  bound, by what the Congress initially  intended with the Clean Air Act, not  what the EPA thinks today is their  job\u2014and particularly if it is not a job  that everybody in this building knows  the legislators will not do. If the legislators won\u2019t  do  it,  the  legislators  shouldn\u2019t let the regulators do it, and  this simply clarifies that.  I urge my colleagues this week to  vote for this amendment, to make it  clear to the Environmental Protection  Agency that they have plenty of things  to do and many things that we will  support them as they do, but this isn\u2019t  one of them. This hurts our economy.  It is not their mission. It was not the  intention of the Clean Air Act. This  amendment allows  that  to be  reinforced once again by the Congress, the  group that is supposed to pass the laws.  Laws aren\u2019t supposed to be passed by  regulators. I suppose they are intentionally determined to be implemented  by regulators but not created by regulators or created by the administration. That is our job.  This bill reemphasizes our job. Again,  it doesn\u2019t let the regulatory group do a  job that increases the utility bill, that  doubles the electric bill in Missouri,  and raises the electric bill for the vast  preponderance of Americans, for people  retired, on a fixed income. Clearly, jobs  will go away if those electric bills are  raised, and they will not go to other  places in the United States in most  cases; they will go to other countries  that care a whole lot less about what  comes out of the smoke stack than we  do.  So if the EPA is allowed to do with  greenhouse gases what it says it wants  to do, we will lose the jobs and the  problem will get greater because these  jobs will go to countries that care a  whole lot less about emissions than we  do.  Let\u2019s let the legislators do their job.  I encourage my colleagues to vote for  this amendment  this week as  they  think about how we approach this important  issue\u2014about  our  economy,  about our jobs, about our families and  our future.

A bill to amend title XVIII of  the Social Security Act  to protect  Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to home  health services under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise  today to join with my colleague from  Washington in introducing legislation,  the Home Health Care Access Protection Act of 2011, to prevent future unfair administrative cuts  in Medicare  home health payment rates.  Home health has become an increasingly important part of our health care  system. The kinds of highly skilled and  often technically complex services that  our Nation\u2019s home health agencies provide have helped to keep families together and  enabled millions of our  most frail and vulnerable older and disabled persons to avoid hospitals and  nursing homes and  stay  just where  they want to be\u2014in the comfort and security of their own homes. Moreover,  by helping these individuals to avoid  more costly  institutional care, they  are saving Medicare billions of dollars  each year.  That is why I find it so ironic\u2014and  troubling\u2014that  the Medicare  home  health benefit continually comes under  attack.  The health care reform bill signed  into law by the President last year includes $40 billion in cuts to home care  over 10 years. Moreover, these cuts are  a  \u2018\u2018double-whammy\u2019\u2019  because  they  come on top of $25 billion in additional  cuts to home health imposed by the  Centers  for Medicare  and Medicaid  Services through regulation in the last  several years.  These  cuts  are  particularly  disproportionate for a program that costs  Medicare less than $20 billion a year.  This simply is not right, and it certainly is not in the best interest of our  nation\u2019s seniors who rely on home care  to keep them out of hospitals, nursing  homes, and other institutions.  The payment rate cuts implemented  and proposed by CMS are based on the  assertion that home health agencies  have  intentionally  \u2018\u2018gamed  the  system\u2019\u2019 by claiming that their patients  have conditions of higher clinical severity than they actually have in order  to receive higher Medicare payments.  This unfounded allegation of \u2018\u2018case mix  creep\u2019\u2019 is based on what CMS contends  to be an increase in the average clinical assessment \u2018\u2018score\u2019\u2019 of home health  patients over the last few years.  In fact, there are very real clinical  and policy explanations for why the average clinical severity of home care patients\u2019 health conditions may have increased over the years. For example,  the incentives built into the hospital  diagnosis-related group\u2014or DRG\u2014reimbursement system have led to the  faster discharge of sicker patients. Advances in technology and changes in  medical  practice have  also  enabled  home health agencies to treat more  complicated medical conditions  that  previously could only be treated in hospitals, nursing homes, or inpatient rehabilitation facilities.  Moreover, this unfair payment rate  cut is being assessed across the board,  even  for home health agencies that  showed a decrease in their clinical assessment scores.

VIRGINIA FOXX  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 29, 2011  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise again today  to call attention to a significant conflict of interest within the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee  (TPSAC)\u2014a  conflict  that  can and should cast doubt on its recent report  to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the effect of menthol cigarettes on the  public health.  Last year, I submitted a statement for the  Record referencing a Boston Globe article entitled \u2018\u2018FDA Lax on Conflicts of Interest,\u2019\u2019 and  I\u2019m saddened  to see  that  this problem continues to this day at the FDA. Since the FDA  announced  the  nine  voting members  of  TPSAC, questions have surfaced regarding financial and ethical conflicts of interest among  several of  the members. Rather  than  investigate the alleged conflicts and eliminate the  shadow of doubt looming over the committee,  the FDA has stood idly by as these conflicts  have  festered and  threatened  to undermine  the very purpose TPSAC was formed to serve.  Several members appointed to TPSAC have  substantial  financial  interests at stake  in  the  decisions  rendered by  the Committee. One  member is an active consultant to drug companies  that manufacture smoking cessation  products. Another member stands  to make  money on a patented new smoking cessation  drug. Both of these members have also testified against  tobacco companies  in several  legal proceedings. The conflicts could not be  clearer.  Now, we find that TPSAC has, as many of  the original skeptics predicted, released a recommendation  that, short of an outright ban,  nevertheless notes  that  \u2018\u2018removal of menthol  cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit  the  public  health.\u2019\u2019  Rather  than  accept  TPSAC\u2019s report as an unbiased call to action,  we are faced with the same controversy that  should have been corrected more than a year  ago.  The people deserve a government free from  the appearance of impropriety. They have entrusted the members of this Chamber, as well  as officials appointed within the Administration,  to enforce the law even-handedly and to engage  in policy decisions unencumbered by  conflicts of interest, personal biases, or unethical predispositions.  The only solution is for FDA to reject the  recommendation of TPSAC and appoint new,  unbiased members to the committee in order  to carry out the purpose of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The  FDA owes the people a fair and untarnished  recommendation on this important issue and I  call on the FDA to take appropriate measures  to remedy TPSAC\u2019s inane report and conclusions.  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO GENERAL  JAMES R. JOSEPH  HON. LOU BARLETTA  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 29, 2011  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  honor and acknowledge Major General James  R. Joseph and congratulate him on his recent  promotion  to Assistant Adjutant General\u2014  Army, Pennsylvania, National Guard,  Joint  Force Headquarters, Pennsylvania.  Mr. Joseph, or \u2018\u2018Jimmy Joe,\u2019\u2019 as I know him,  enlisted as a soldier in 1971 to begin his military career. He graduated from basic training  at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and obtained his advanced individual training as a military policeman at Fort Gordon, Georgia. General Joseph  completed a tour of duty in Vietnam, where he  was assigned to the 716th Military Police Battalion. He finished his active duty tour at Fort  Polk, Louisiana, with the 258th Military Police  Company.  But General Joseph did not stop serving our  country. He joined the Pennsylvania Army National Guard in 1974 and was assigned to be  a combat engineer with Company C, 876th  Engineer Battalion. Currently, General Joseph  serves as the primary advisor to the Adjutant  General for all joint logistics matters, including  commodity and material management, property and personnel movement, storage and  distribution, and defense movement coordination, including the acquisition and sustainment  of unique equipment used by National Guard  units in homeland defense, civil support, and  counterdrug operations. He has oversight of  the Eastern Army Aviation Training Site, 166th  Regional Training  Institute, and  the Medical  Battalion Training Site.  Mr. Speaker, General Joseph has dedicated  his life to serving our country. His family has  made sacrifices as he committed himself  to  protecting our freedom and keeping our citizens safe. His courage and commitment  is  something  to be greatly respected and honored. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to congratulate  my  friend,  \u2018\u2018Jimmy Joe,\u2019\u2019 and  I ask my colleagues to stand with me in honoring Major  General James R. Joseph for his greatly deserved promotion to Assistant Adjutant General of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard.  f  INTRODUCTION OF H.R. 804  HON. BOB FILNER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 29, 2011  Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker,  in September  2010, Operation Iraqi Freedom was renamed  Operation New Dawn.  To this effect, I introduced, H.R. 804, legislation that would ensure that military service in  Operation New Dawn continues to be considered service in a theater of operations, for purposes of eligibility  for veterans\u2019 hospital and  nursing  home  care  and medical  services  through the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Our nation\u2019s brave men and women have  fought  together hand  in hand  in  the war  against terror, and many of them are experiencing multiple and extended deployments in  support of Iraq and Afghanistan.  When they return home, we must make certain that veterans would not be denied access  to certain programs because of the way the  law is currently written.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  f  OVERREACHING ACTIONS OF  FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT  HON. TIMOTHY V. JOHNSON  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 29, 2011  Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, while  being later to the effort than my good friend  Congressman RONPAUL, many of you know  that I have long expressed concerns about the  sometimes overreaching actions of federal law  enforcement, especially as they interact with  American citizens.  Most law enforcement officials in this country are highly ethical with a strong desire to  serve the effort to keep our country and our  communities safe. Unfortunately, as  in any  profession, there are some people who do not  uphold those standards.  Those concerns are a principal reason why  the Bill of Rights was passed. Those concerns  should also hold a primary place in our thinking as we vote on legislation.  This issue came closer to home for me as  two constituents, one a U.S. citizen, were arrested by federal law enforcement officials this  month, accused of violating a law that doesn\u2019t  exist. My office attempted to get information  about their arrest. We were denied information  about which agency had arrested them, where  they were being held, and the charges against  them.  All  of  the  charges  against  them were  dropped  just eight days  later after a  federal  judge reviewed the evidence and determined  that no crime had been committed. The cost  to my constituents was  in  the  tens of  thousands of dollars. They are still being threatened with the forfeiture of property.

MICHAEL C. BURGESS  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 29, 2011  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize  the Flower Mound High School  Choir.  In 1999  the high school opened with  the hope of becoming \u2018\u2018A World Class School  Educating Tomorrow\u2019s Leaders.\u2019\u2019 Since  then,  Newsweek Magazine named  it one of  the  \u2018\u2018Top 1000 Best Public High Schools\u2019\u2019 in the  U.S., based on AP scores. Of  the school\u2019s  many accomplishments, none resonate quite  like the Flower Mound High School Choir.  The Flower Mound High School Choir regularly  enjoys  success  at  University  Interscholastic League competitions as well as private competitions. Over time they have earned  a slew of \u2018\u2018Sweepstakes\u2019\u2019 awards as well as  \u2018\u2018Best  of Class\u2019\u2019  and  \u2018\u2018Grand Champion\u2019\u2019  awards  from all over  the country.

And  just  last week  they were here in Washington D.C. to perform  at the WWII Memorial. In their song choice,  they sought to honor our nation\u2019s veterans.  It is heartening to know that this burgeoning  generation continues to hold our veterans in  such high regard. I want to thank the Flower  Mound High School Choir for coming to our  nation\u2019s capitol to honor our veterans.  f  HONORING ALEXANDER CHRISTIAN  NASON  HON.

Alexander is a very special young  man who has exemplified the finest qualities  of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop  376, and earning the most prestigious award  of Eagle Scout.  Alexander has been very active with his  troop, participating  in many scout activities.  Over the many years Alexander has been involved with scouting, he has not only earned  numerous merit badges, but also the respect  of his family, peers, and community. Most notably, Alexander  has  earned  the  rank  of  Firebuilder in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say and the  position of Senior Patrol Leader in his troop.  Alexander has also contributed to his community  through his Eagle Scout project. Alexander planned and supervised  the construction of a storage closet  for Liberty United  Methodist Church in Liberty, Missouri.  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in  commending Alexander Christian Nason  for  his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of  America and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.  f  AFGHANISTAN WAR POWERS  RESOLUTION  SPEECHOF  HON. SAM FARR  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 17, 2011  Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  in  strong support of swift U.S. troop withdrawal  from Afghanistan. This decade-long war  is  costing our country tens of hundreds of lives  and hundreds of billions of dollars.  In 2010  alone, nearly 500 brave American men and  women  lost  their  lives, which  is 63% more  than the 2009 death toll. And as I speak, our  government, which has vowed to reduce the  deficit, has sent millions more overseas for a  war with no  foreseeable end. From 2008  to  2011, overall government spending has  increased by 9%, while funding for the war in  Afghanistan has increased by a startling 25%.  As many of my colleagues demand $100 billion budget cuts,  they need  look no  further  than our reckless war spending. For the good  of our troops and the health of our economy,  this war must end.  And this viewpoint is shared across the nation. According to a recent Washington Post  poll, nearly two-thirds of the American people  support an immediate withdrawal from Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, our job in this chamber is  to represent our constituents, and they have  spoken loud and clear. The American people  are fed up with a war that has done little to  improve our national security or bolster our  international standing. Furthermore, after nearly ten years of fighting, it is crystal clear that  the problem in Afghanistan cannot be solved  by military means alone. Stabilization and reconstruction, governance, and peace-building  activities can help to stabilize states, promote  rule of law, and bring enduring peace at a sliver of the cost we pay for troops on the ground.  Make no mistake about it: I firmly support  our men and women in uniform. For this reason, we must bring them home from a battlefront with no real hope of military victory.  I  thank my colleague, Mr. KUCINICH from Ohio,  for re-introducing this Resolution. I was proud  to cosponsor it in the last Congress, and I will  firmly offer my support today in hopes that we  can finally end this war.  RECOGNIZING PENSACOLA STATE  COLLEGE WOMEN\u2019S BASKETBALL  TEAM AS STATE CHAMPIONS  HON. JEFF MILLER  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 29, 2011  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to recognize the Pensacola State College Women\u2019s Basketball Team on  their recent victory as Champions of the 40th Florida  Community  College  Activities  Association  Women\u2019s Basketball Tournament.  In 2010, the Pensacola State College Lady  Pirates suffered a difficult defeat in the final  seconds of the state semifinal game; however,  under the leadership of Coach Chanda Rigby,  PSC\u2019s players were able to use this defeat as  motivation for their 2011 season. The Lady Pirates entered into the season with high expectations and ranked 14th nationally in the preseason National Junior College Athletic Association Women\u2019s Basketball Poll.  After an  impressive early season  run,  including a victory over the 5th ranked team in  the Nation,  the Lady Pirates soared  to  the  ranks of 3rd in the Nation on November 17.  The following week the Lady Pirates continued  to rise in the rankings, moving all the way to  the number 1 slot. The Lady Pirates did not let  the pressure of being the top ranked team affect their performance, and they finished the  regular season with a perfect record, 29\u20130,  never relinquishing their place atop the polls.  Victories in their first two games of the Florida state championship set up a fourth meeting with nationally ranked Northwest Florida  State College. The previous  three meetings  between these teams were highly competitive,  with two of those three outcomes decided in  overtime. The championship game was an  equally competitive affair. Ultimately, however,  the Lady Pirates\u2019 season-long goal was  fulfilled, as they cut down the nets, improving to  32\u20130 and moving on  to  the National Junior  College Athletic Association\u2019s national  tournament, where they finished their season with  a victory  in  the consolation game and  the  number 3 national ranking.  On behalf of the United States Congress, I  congratulate  the Pensacola State College  Lady Pirates for their outstanding accomplishments. My wife Vicki joins me in offering our  best wishes  to  the players, coaches,  faculty  and staff at Pensacola State College for their  continued success.  f  SOUTHWEST GUILFORD GIRLS WIN  IT ALL  HON. HOWARD COBLE  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 29, 2011  Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, today I wish to  recognize the girls\u2019 basketball team of Southwest Guilford High School, located in the Sixth  District of North Carolina, for winning their first  4\u2013A  state  championship  since  1985. The  Southwest Cowgirls defeated their opponent,  Raleigh Millbrook, in convincing fashion by a  nine point margin with the final score of 44\u2013  35.  Southwest Guilford scored  the  points  and  never  relinquished  first seven  the  lead  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:34 Mar 30, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\A29MR8.028 E29MRPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",

            "5": "May 16, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S2979  to this level of debt, the consequences  of that to its people and to its financial  future and its stature in the world and  its ability to do the many wonderful  things the United States has been able  to do, to lead the world in so many different areas\u2014all this is in jeopardy if  we do not address this issue.  What they are saying, if I could bring  that into just some basic conclusions,  is, No. 1, this crisis is real. All you  have to do is look at this chart I have  in the Chamber to understand this crisis is real. Here is where we were in  World War II when we were having to  go into debt, which we thought was serious at the time. But look at what has  happened in just the last 30 years.  So the crisis is real. As measured by  historical analysis of nations that have  faced these kinds of situations before,  the  consequences  are  always  dire.  Therefore, No. 1\u2014and I was glad to  hear my Democratic  colleague  acknowledge this is the case because this  is something both sides of the aisle are  going to have to deal with\u2014both sides  have to recognize that, No. 1, the crisis  is real and it is now.  The second conclusion, based on what  the experts are saying, is that we have  to act now, not later. This is not something we can postpone. For years and  years and years, as this line has gone  forward, as shown on this chart, Congress has said: We\u2019ll get to that. Presidents have also said: We need to address our debt, but only after the next  election.  Well, there is always a next election.  Now the latest thing we hear is: Well,  we need to take care of that after the  2012 election. We will put it before the  American people in terms of which way  they want to go.  The American  people  spoke  very  loudly and clearly in 2010. If that was  not a wake-up call politically, I do not  know what will be. But, nevertheless,  falling into the trap of simply saying  that waiting until after the next election we might be in a better position to  deal with it then simply postpones the  inevitable and potentially brings about  a crisis which will occur before the  election in 2012.  It  is shameless to put before the  American people that the political situation is such that we are not willing  to address this now and, therefore, we  are putting their lives, their futures,  their children\u2019s futures, and their children\u2019s children\u2019s futures in jeopardy,  while we place a higher priority on the  political outcome of 2012 rather than  on what we were elected to do in 2010  and years before.  No. 1, the crisis is real. No. 2, we have  to act now without delay. No. 3, many  experts have advised that,  if we do  something, it needs to be a comprehensive plan that includes all aspects of  Federal  spending. We need  to  talk  about the discretionary part of our  budget, which we vote on every year,  although in the last couple of years we  have not even passed a budget. Last  year, we failed to pass a single appropriations bill.  Instead, we have had  continuing  resolutions  and  supplemental  spending bills, which  is not  what we were elected to do and not a  good way to govern. But we have to address that portion of the budget.  When addressing a  long-term economic plan, we cannot exempt major  sectors of our budget such as interest  and defense and mandatory spending  and we must  include  entitlements.  That is No. 4, many experts say. If you  do not have a comprehensive plan that  includes everything, then the burden  falls on a disproportionate share of discretionary spending that undermines  essential  programs  the  government  ought to be engaged in.  We cannot get  from here to there  without  including all aspects of the  budget,  including comprehensive  tax  reform. That is another thing these experts have said. Many say the comprehensive  plan must  include  some  basis on which we move forward with  tax reform.  Senator WYDEN and I have cosponsored a bipartisan bill for that very effort. We are not saying it is the perfect  bill. We are saying it is something in  place with which we could start on and  address comprehensive tax reform, to  broaden the base and generate more  revenue  from  the  economic  growth  that comes with lowering taxes and reforming the tax code.  Entitlements are a must. That  is  what these people have said. You cannot get  from where we are now to  where we need to be unless we include  Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security reforms. We all know there are  structural problems, given the massive  move into retirement age of the baby  boom population of this country. We  all know these programs are teetering  on the edge. There was a report from  the trustees of Medicare last week saying they are moving up 5 years when  Medicare runs out of money in order to  pay  for benefits  that are promised  under that program.  We all know  there are  some  relatively painless solutions the earlier  we start, in terms of adjusting the retirement age,  in terms of adjusting  some  formulas, and making some of  the changes that have been proposed  that we are talking about. But if we do  not include that entitlement spending  in our discussions, we are not going to  be able to reach a successful conclusion.  Another principle they have listed is  that we have to make this for the long  term and we have to lock it in. We  have  to guarantee  the promises we  make and the commitments we make,  as we address  this problem of how  much to cut and how to change the Tax  Code and how to work through the revenue side of this effort. They have to be  locked in place and guaranteed, hopefully, with the passage of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.  We failed twice in the 1990s in this  Senate to pass a constitutional amendment to send to the States for ratification. It failed by one vote on two occasions. I wonder what would have happened had we passed that. No, I do not  wonder. I know what would have happened. We would have been forced to  make the decision at this point, as  shown on the chart, which would have  brought us back to here instead of now  having to go from this point on the  chart all the way down\u2014a much more  painful process  than had we passed  that amendment then.  So what we want to avoid, when we  are forced to do this\u2014and it is going to  happen; we have to do it\u2014we need to  lock that in on a path that will bring  us back to fiscal parity and balanced  budgets and then lock it in with a constitutional amendment. It cannot be  done in 1 year. That is why the other  principle is that this has to be a long-  term process in getting us from where  we are to where we need to go, and  then we need to stay with it. We cannot just pass it for 2 years, elect a new  Congress and come in and make these  changes.  If we move forward, and if we can  come together to find a rational solution to this, it will send\u2014this is the  last point the experts have said\u2014it will  send a tremendous signal around the  world to all those investors who have  always looked to the United States as  the safe-haven, last-resort place to put  their money. The dollar will be rescued  from falling against other currencies.  It will continue  to be  seen as  the  world\u2019s  currency. Confidence  in  the  United States as a safe place to put  your money will be restored in nations  around the world. The American people  will have a tremendous psychological  sense of relief and assurance that we  are finally getting serious about doing  something about this crisis that faces  us.  Lastly, what I would like to do is  send a message to President Obama,  the majority  leader, my Republican  and Democratic colleagues, the minority leader, and others: The time is now.  I believe we should suspend, as soon as  we can, everything but the absolute essential and spend the next amount of  time, starting now, debating and working through\u2014whether it takes day and  night and weekends\u2014rolling up our  sleeves and sitting down, holding this  debate across the country, to get input  from the public, but also meeting together, working to find a solution to  this, which we all recognize has to be  done, without letting this thing trail  all the way to late July and then do  something in a panic.  This crisis is going to occur. It is  going to occur probably sooner than we  think. The last piece of advice they  gave us\u2014I know I said it just a minute  ago\u2014but the other piece of advice they  gave us was: Trust us, you do not want  the financial markets to force you into  doing things that will be done  in a  rush, that will be done in a panic, that  will not be rationally applied; and instead of having a principled, rational  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:31 Feb 15, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\S16MY1.REC S16MY1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",

Their stories stand in sharp contrast  to what we heard last week when the  CEOs of the five largest oil companies  testified before  the Senate Finance  Committee. They insisted on holding  on to those tax loopholes that they  said before they do not want and they  have acknowledged they will not use to  expand production.  A common refrain we hear from conservative Washington  politicians  is  that  just as American  families are  tightening their belts, so, too, should  the Federal Government. Just ask Laurie and the thousands of other Ohioans  who work hard and play by the rules  and are doing everything they can to  get by.  What about big oil? They are doing  just fine with windfall profits, billions  and billions. The five largest oil companies made $32 billion in profits in the  first quarter of this year. Based on  that, over four quarters over this full  calendar year of 2011, we can project  the five companies\u2019 profits being $128  billion plus\u2014$128 billion. Their profits  are good. But when their profits are  more than $30 billion in the first quarter alone, it is clear they do not need  these taxpayer-funded giveaways.  Americans spent 28 percent more for  gas in the first 3 months of 2011 than  they did in the same period in 2010.  Meanwhile, the big five oil companies\u2014  BP,  Chevron,  ConocoPhillips,  ExxonMobil, and Shell\u2014made 38 percent more profit. The companies then  used a major portion of these additional profits to buy back stock to enrich their board of directors, senior  managers, and shareholders.  These massive profits are possible by  a misguided part of the Tax Code\u2014one  that allows them to take advantage of  credits that are, in fact, meant to encourage  American  manufacturing.  That  is why the Close Big Oil Tax  Loopholes Act is so important. The bill  would end more than $2 billion in tax  subsidy deductions and royalty relief  that big companies receive each year.  Consumers who are already paying  for $4-a-gallon gas at the pump should  not be forced to write another $2 billion check to companies that do not  need it. But that is exactly what our  Tax Code allows. To put  it another  way, it grants corporate welfare to Big  Oil. It is unnecessary and undermines  the actual manufacturing that can create jobs and strengthen our production  of domestic clean energy.  We should promote only those tax  credits\u2014only precisely those tax credits\u2014that constitute an effective use of  tax dollars. For example, manufacturers from across Ohio and the Nation  have benefited from the 48(c) advanced  manufacturing tax credits that help us  move away from our dependence on foreign oil.  Mr. President, 48(c) leverages public  incentives to attract private sector investment. That means government and  business working together to create  jobs and build a clean energy economy.  Seven Ohio companies were awarded  $125 million in initial 48(c) funding in  the first phase of last year. These companies and their workers\u2014in Bedford,  Bucyrus, Circleville, Dayton, Findlay,  Perrysburg, and Toledo, OH\u2014will retool their factories to build clean energy products from wind turbine bolts  to energy-efficient lamps and home appliances to state-of-the-art solar panel  technologies.  I introduced the Security in Energy  and Manufacturing Act\u2014the  SEAM  Act\u2014to extend the 48(c) program. The  SEAM Act will promote grants as a  means to invest in more companies, especially small- and medium-sized manufacturers that do not have tax liabilities or companies that struggle to find  credit in the tight financial market.  We want  these manufacturing  tax  credits\u2014very different from what the  oil industry is demanding they keep because their tax incentives accomplish  none of this. We are asking that those  startup  companies,  those  companies  that are not yet so profitable, take  these 48(c) tax credits because they  simply do not have the tax liability  yet. We are asking that those be part  of the code so those companies can get  some assistance as they begin to grow  their businesses and conserve energy.  This would  further  promote U.S.  clean energy manufacturing and ensure  our manufacturers  produce  all  the  component parts in the clean energy  supply chain.  Yet instead of adopting this valuable  incentive, Republican opposition in the  Senate and Republican opposition  in  the House  forces us to continue to  allow Big Oil to exploit the manufacturing deduction to extract oil from  the ground. They do not need any more  incentives to drill for oil when they are  getting close to $100 a barrel. What  they are doing is not manufacturing in  any sense of the word.  We need a more comprehensive reexamination of the corporate Tax Code.  In the meantime, we should be able to  agree there is no justification to continuing tax subsidies to companies that  have no need for them. This legislation  is modest. It is only in the scheme of a  huge Federal budget, in the scheme of  $125 billion profits for the oil companies. It is only in the scheme of that a  first step. After removing these unnecessary tax loopholes, the Senate should  work on cracking down on both reckless Wall Street speculators and OPEC  members  that  manipulate  prices  through collusion and price fixing.  One step is to take away the tax subsidies. Middle-class families in Dayton,  Akron,  Canton,  Youngstown,  Huntington, Charleston,  in Beckley are  reaching into their pockets and giving  to the oil companies. We are taking  that away. At the same time, the administration needs to crack down on  Wall Street speculators that are gaming  the  system as  they manipulate  prices with OPEC nations through collusion and price fixing. By taking these  necessary  steps, we  show how  our  spending and our Tax Code and our  budget can reflect not only our priorities but how we can actually meet  them.  The time to ask is now. I ask my  more conservative colleagues here to  join us. It is a pretty easy step to move  toward a better fiscal situation, a more  coherent budget policy\u2014that we eliminate these tax subsidies that have gone  to America\u2019s  five  largest oil companies, some of the most profitable companies, frankly, in the history of the  world.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  f  NATIONAL POLICE WEEK  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I  rise to honor the service of our Nation\u2019s law enforcement officers on the  occasion  of National Police Week,  which is taking place this year from  May 15 through May 21.  Every day, in cities and towns across  America, police officers put their lives  on the line to protect their fellow citizens. As a State and Federal prosecutor, I was proud to work alongside  so many fine law enforcement officers  in Rhode Island. I saw their hard work,  their dedication to protecting the public, their commitment to upholding the  rule of  law, and the sacrifices they  made for their communities.  During National Police Week, we remember those officers who have fallen  in the line of duty, and we honor their  families. It is a tragedy for a single officer to be killed in the line of duty.  Yet according to the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial  Fund,  there were 162 law enforcement fatalities in America last year, a jump of  nearly 40 percent from the year before.  In 2011, the statistics are even more upsetting: as of May 12, there have already been 69 officer fatalities, a 17-  percent increase from this time a year  ago.  Here in the Nation\u2019s Capital, we are  marking the service and loss of our  country\u2019s fallen police officers through  the events of National Police Week.  Yesterday more  than  20,000 officers  gathered in Washington, DC, to observe  National Peace Officers Memorial Day.  I was proud to  join with Chairman  LEAHY, Ranking Member GRASSLEY,  and other members of the Senate in cosponsoring  a  resolution  recognizing  that  day,  and  commemorating  the  dedication of those officers killed or injured in the line of duty.  I also wanted to highlight for my colleagues two recent events to honor this  occasion in my home State.  Earlier this month, Newport hosted  the 28th annual Aquidneck Island National Police Parade. Hundreds of officers from nearly every police agency in  Rhode Island marched alongside more  than 1,000 fellow police officers from  across the Northeast and Canada.

            "21": "May 16, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S2995  support  for  the production and distribution of  those alternative  fuels.  Again, instead of creating a whole new  program  to  support  this alternative  fuel  infrastructure, the bill modifies  the existing clean energy Department  of Energy loan guarantee program created section 1703 of the Energy Policy  Act of 2005. This  loan program was  aimed at  financing new,  innovative  low-carbon electricity generation technologies. That is all well and good, but  those investments do not address the  very  real  energy  security  challenge  facing our country from oil imports,  especially since so little electricity in  the U.S.  is actually generated using  oil. Our bill would allow this already  existing program to be used for alternative fuel infrastructure.  The bill includes additional measures  to  provide  technical  assistance  to  States and local governments, public-  private partnerships and utility companies and utility commissions to help  overcome barriers to the deployment of  these alternative fuel vehicles. The bill  provides worker  training  and  technology research programs to make sure  there is a skilled workforce and new  technologies. Taken altogether, these  provisions are designed to provide the  tools  for manufacturers,  parts  suppliers,  fuel providers,  transportation  planners, utility regulators, and State  and local officials to deploy alternative  fuel vehicles, and the fuels to power  them,  in numbers that make a difference and truly reduce our dependence on imported oil.  Finally, the bill includes a funding  offset by capping the size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, at 90  days of non-North American crude oil  and petroleum fuel imports. Under current law, the SPR is supposed to grow  to 1 billion barrels at a cost of over $5  billion for construction and, at current  prices, over $30 billion to fill it with  oil. Buying more  insurance  doesn\u2019t  make that old car any safer. While I  support having a Strategic Petroleum  Reserve, the plain truth of the matter  is that spending billions of additional  dollars to put more oil into the SPR  will not reduce our dependence on oil  imports by a single barrel. This bill  would take the money generated by reducing the size of the SPR and reinvest  it in alternative energy technologies  that will,  in  fact, genuinely  reduce  that dependence. Rather than putting  more oil in the ground for short-term  supply emergencies, we put American  innovation to work to reduce our Nation\u2019s oil dependence permanently.  I applaud my colleague from Oregon,  Senator MERKLEY, and our other Senate  colleagues,  for  recognizing  that  new vehicle technologies now entering  the market are not just scientific curiosities, but game-changing opportunities to finally get our country off of its  addiction  to oil.  I  look  forward  to  working with them to enact programs  and policies that ensure these alternative fuel technologies succeed in the  marketplace.

            "4": "H3992  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE June 3, 2011  And so I urge support of the rule and  commend the  freshman Congressman  from South Carolina for his leadership.  Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Again, just so we\u2019re all clear here,  under the War Powers Act, if a concurrent resolution  is passed demanding  that the troops are removed from a  particular country, then they will be  removed, if you believe that the War  Powers Act carries any weight, and I  believe that the War Powers Act is relevant here. That\u2019s what the resolution  by  the  gentleman  from Ohio  (Mr.  KUCINICH) does.  What the resolution my  friends  in  the Republican leadership have drafted  does  is  nothing.  Your  resolution  doesn\u2019t even have to go to the Senate.  It won\u2019t go to the Senate. It directs the  President to do a whole bunch of things  that, quite frankly, he can ignore, because this bill doesn\u2019t mean anything.  What this is\u2014and let\u2019s be clear about  what this is\u2014is this is a way for some  of my friends on the other side of the  aisle to kind of cover their back sides,  to be able to say to their constituents,  We did something tough on Libya. Let  me read to you how tough the language  is in the bill that the Speaker of the  House has drawn up. A lot of tough language.  It sounds good. Except when  you look a little bit more closely, you  realize that this is an H. Res, which  doesn\u2019t mean a thing.  So if you\u2019re into symbolism, if you\u2019re  into therapy, you know, vote for the  Boehner resolution. If you are interested in action, if you are interested in  actually living up to our responsibilities as lawmakers in the United States  Congress, then I would suggest that  you  look at the resolution that the  gentleman from Ohio has drafted.  You can talk all you want about how  the Republican  alternative  here  is  somehow meaningful,  but  it  really  isn\u2019t. Again, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised.  No one should be surprised here, because most of what they have done  since they assumed control of the Congress has been meaningless, has been  symbolic. Whether  it\u2019s dealing with  health care or jobs, which they don\u2019t  want to talk about, you name it, a lot  of it has been mostly symbolic. I think  on the issue of war, we should take it  more  seriously and be more honest  with the American people as to what  we\u2019re doing.  At this point I would like to yield 2  minutes to the gentleman New York  (Mr. NADLER).  Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, what we are confronted  with today is not primarily a question  of foreign policy or even of war policy.  We are presented with a question of  constitutional law and of the prerogatives of the United States Congress.  Shall the President, like the King of  England, be a dictator in foreign policy? Shall the President have the unfettered right to take this country to  war without so much as a  \u2018\u2018by your  leave\u2019\u2019 from Congress as the King of  England could do without authorization from Parliament?  The authors of our Constitution answered that question in the negative.  They said, \u2018\u2018No, we don\u2019t trust kings,  we don\u2019t trust executives to make a decision to go to war. We want that to be  the prerogative of the people as represented by the Congress.\u2019\u2019  b0930  A whole series of Presidents since  World War  II have  forgotten  that,  starting with Harry Truman in the Korean War and Lyndon Johnson in the  Vietnam War right up to the present.  Now, there are reasons for this, and I  will go into that when I speak on the  Kucinich resolution a  little  later.  I  would simply observe now I am going  to vote for the Boehner resolution, but  I  am  also  going  to  vote  for  the  Kucinich resolution.  The Boehner resolution is fine as far  as it goes, but it doesn\u2019t deal with the  basic problem. The Boehner resolution  says the President has failed to provide  Congress with a compelling rationale  based upon U.S. security interests for  current United States military activities, that is true. Frankly, I do not understand why we are in Libya.  The Boehner resolution then says the  President shall transmit to the House  of Representatives all kinds of information, basically saying why we are  there, and that\u2019s good. You should have  done that before we went there, but it\u2019s  good that we demand this information  now. But then the Boehner resolution  stops.  All it demands of the President is  that he gives us his reasons. And his  reasons, maybe we will agree with him,  maybe we won\u2019t. Maybe they are sufficient, and maybe they are not.  Then it says, \u2018\u2018Findings.  \u2018\u2018(a) The President has not sought,  and Congress has not provided, authorization for the introduction or continued involvement of the United States  Armed Forces in Libya.\u2019\u2019  That\u2019s true.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. MCGOVERN.  I yield  the gentleman 1 additional minute.  Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman.  \u2018\u2018(b) Congress has the constitutional  prerogative  to withhold  funding  for  any  unauthorized  use  of  the U.S.  Armed Forces, including for unauthorized activities regarding Libya.\u2019\u2019  That\u2019s also  true, but  so what.  It  doesn\u2019t direct anything. It doesn\u2019t say  that what the President did was outside his powers. It doesn\u2019t direct that  the activity stop. It doesn\u2019t do anything. I think we should do something,  because if in this situation we do not  reclaim congressional powers,  I can  think of no set of circumstances under  which the President cannot go to war  without going to Congress first, no set  of circumstances. And that turns the  Constitution and the intentions of our  Framers and  the  intentions of our  whole constitutional law system on its  head.  Therefore, I urge a vote of \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 on  the Boehner resolution and a vote of  \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019  on  the Kucinich  resolution,  which, unlike the Boehner resolution,  actually does something about the situation we find ourselves in.  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM).  Mr. DENHAM. You know, this could  not be any more serious. It\u2019s important  for us to debate what our servicemembers are doing in foreign conflicts.  The War Powers Act, it is important  to make sure that the President understands from Congress exactly what we  are willing to do with our American  troops and where we are willing to  fight.  But I do agree he has to give us his  reasons. In Desert Storm, we knew why  we were there. We knew what our role  was, we knew what our goals were, we  knew what our exit strategy was.  These are the very reasons that we  are looking for before we appropriate  funds, before we put our troops at risk,  before any boots go to the ground, before this conflict escalates any further,  before a new government comes into  play, we expect these answers to be  given to us. We expect the President to  do his job, to show leadership, to address Congress and explain why he is  committing American servicemembers.  So this is very serious. It is very serious and it\u2019s long overdue. The President should have come here first. He  certainly should have come here within  60 days. It is long overdue, it is very serious, and the time to demand answers  is now.  Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 15 seconds.  I hear a lot of talk on the other side  about the Boehner resolution requires  the President to do this, it directs him  to do that, he must do this, he shall do  this. But the way you have presented  this in this H. Res. form, the President  doesn\u2019t have to do anything. So let\u2019s  not fool ourselves, and let\u2019s not fool  the American people  that  somehow  this is meaningful.  I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. JACKSONLEE).  (Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to revise and  extend her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. This  could be no more a somber debate than  what we are doing here today, and I  thank the manager, Mr. MCGOVERN,  and the gentleman from South Carolina for recognizing, through the leadership of our House, that the American  people must be engaged  in the constitutional duties that have been set  out for the three branches of government.  Under the Constitution, the war powers are divided between Congress and  the President, and among other relevant grants, Congress has the power  to declare war and raise and support  armed forces while the President is the  Commander in Chief.

            "12": "H4000  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE June 3, 2011  the White House, then more forceful  action may be inevitable. The President can choose to act with the support  of Congress and with the support of the  American people, but he will not be allowed to proceed without it.  I urge my colleagues to vote for this  strong and necessary resolution.  With that, I am pleased to yield 1  minute to the distinguished Speaker of  the House of Representatives, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BOEHNER).  Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my  colleague for yielding.  In March, when the President committed our troops to NATO\u2019s mission  in Libya, I said that he had a responsibility to the American people to define  the mission, to explain what America\u2019s  role was in achieving that mission and  lay out how it was to be accomplished.  He has not effectively done so. The  American people and the Members of  this House have questions and concerns  that have gone unanswered.  The President of the United States is  our Commander in Chief, and I have always believed combat decisions should  be left to the Commander in Chief and  to the generals on the ground. But the  House also has an obligation to heed  the concerns of our constituents and to  carry out our constitutional responsibilities.  The resolution I have put forward expresses the will of the people in a responsible way that reflects our commitments to our troops and to our allies.  Let me lay out exactly what this resolution does.  First, it establishes that the President has not asked for and that the  Congress has not granted authorization  for the introduction or continued involvement of our troops in Libya.  Second,  it reasserts Congress\u2019 constitutional role to fund our troops.  Third, it requires the President to  provide, within 14 days, information on  that mission that should have been  provided from the start.  And, lastly, it reaffirms the vote that  we took last week that says that there  should be no troops on the ground in  Libya.  I hope the President will recognize  his obligations outlined in this resolution and provide this information to  Congress and, in doing so, better communicate to the American people what  our mission in Libya is and how it will  be achieved.  The resolution offered by my colleague from Ohio (Mr. KUCINICH) conveys the concerns of the American people, but it also mandates a precipitous  withdrawal from our role in supporting  our NATO allies in Libya. In my opinion, that would undermine our troops  and our allies, which could have serious consequences for our broader national security.  In my view, the gentleman\u2019s resolution goes too far. We may have differences regarding how we got here,  but we cannot turn our backs on our  troops and our NATO partners who  have stuck by us over the last 10 years.  In 1991 in my first vote as a Member  of this body, I voted to authorize the  use of force in the first Gulf War. It  was a consequential time, but I think  we did the right thing. And today is no  different. On behalf of the American  people and our country, we have an obligation  to  support  our  troops  in  harm\u2019s way and to support our allies.  This resolution puts the President on  notice. He has a chance to get this  right; and if he doesn\u2019t, Congress will  exercise  its constitutional authority  and we will make it right.  I urge a \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 on the Boehner resolution and a \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 on the Kucinich resolution.  Mr. BERMAN. I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  (Mr. BERMAN asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition to this resolution.  If the Members of the House choose  to pass the Speaker\u2019s one-Chamber resolution, it should add one finding: that  we declare ourselves to be one big constitutionally created potted plant.  This resolution casts all kinds of aspersions on the President. It states the  President has  failed to provide Congress with a compelling rationale for  operations  in Libya. It  implies that  there has been a withholding of documents and information from this body.  Could the President provide more information to the Congress? Of course.  But we need to look not just at the  President\u2019s failure to seek an authorization, but the refusal of this body to  exercise its authority in this area. The  onus rests with us to recognize the sacred duty of authorizing the use of  force.  A resolution like this, with no operative language, with no invocation of  the War Powers Resolution and which  was presented to Members for the first  time just 14 hours ago, simply perpetuates a dynamic of congressional acquiescence and acquiescence that, for  the most part, has gone on truly since  the Korean War.  There are two choices here. If the  majority thinks that the President\u2019s  initial efforts to stop a humanitarian  catastrophe were wrong or that current  operations in Libya do not have a compelling national security rationale, it  should support Mr. KUCINICH\u2019s approach  and offer a concurrent resolution pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers  Resolution requiring the removal of  U.S. forces.  If the majority has concerns with Mr.  KUCINICH\u2019s approach, as many of us do,  and believes terminating military action would have grave consequences for  U.S. national security, it should simply  authorize the use of force in Libya, incorporating the restrictions on ground  forces that this resolution has, that the  Conyers language in the DOD bill had.  I would gladly join the Speaker in cosponsoring  such an authorization of  the limited use of force.  But pursuing a nonbinding House  Resolution that takes potshots at the  President  and  amounts  to  nothing  more than a sense of the Congress is  just an exercise in political gamesmanship. It is a pedantic effort to embarrass the President without taking any  ownership for the policy of the intervention.  The majority, not the President, puts  this body in a position of powerlessness  through such toothless efforts. We are  60 days into this operation. Either we  should authorize this action or terminate, not play around with reporting  requirements.  The resolution is also confusing. It  states that the President shall not deploy or maintain the presence of U.S.  military units on the ground in Libya.  b1100  But as the majority well knows, U.S.  military activities are limited to air  operations and nothing more. So does  this  language mean the majority  is  okay with the current intervention in  Libya? The majority seems to be raising a fuss while winking at the White  House. That\u2019s not the way to legislate.  Finally, I object to the resolution because it is downright inaccurate. The  resolution  implies  that  there  is no  compelling national security rationale  for operations in Libya. But U.S. interests are clear. They have been forcefully articulated by the administration  and, ironically, by conservative advocates like Bill Kristol.  We are  in Libya because we are  averting a probable massacre against  civilians. We are in Libya because our  NATO partners need our help. Refusal  to act there would send a message to  NATO allies, who are putting  their  forces on the line in Afghanistan, that  we are not a dependable partner. We  are in Libya because our friends struggling for democracy in the Middle East  are watching events there. If we failed  to  act,  or worse,  seek withdrawal  today, what will we be saying to the  activists in Tunisia and Egypt, whose  fragile movements for democracy could  be stifled by the destabilizing effect of  a Qadhafi-led government remaining in  power? And what message would we be  sending to Assad and to other dictators  and enemies about our staying power?  Let\u2019s not kid ourselves. A Qadhafi  who is unleashed to commit acts of terrorism around the world will do so with  unspeakable barbarity. We know Qadhafi\u2019s  record of bloodshed, and we  know his readiness to use terror, especially now that he has nothing to lose.  I cannot think of a more compelling rationale for current operations in Libya.  I object to the characterization that  U.S. national  security  interests and  humanitarian objectives are incompatible. In Libya, it is quite clear that  stopping murder and preventing a refugee crisis very much correspond with  U.S. national interests.  The Republican sponsors of this resolution are trying to have it both ways.  They want to criticize the President  for taking the very action that many  of them called for 3 months ago.

            "20": "H4008  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE June 3, 2011  Debating the bill before us may provide a  convenient opportunity  for opponents of  the  President to make political statements, but it  does so at the expense of our troops who are  actively engaged  in combat operations. This  resolution threatens our critical NATO alliance  and emboldens our enemies.  The Boehner  resolution\u2014like  the Kucinich  measure which we are also debating today\u2014  potentially sends the message to our NATO  allies that the United States does not stand by  its commitments. At a time when we are relying more and more on our NATO allies to support the joint mission in Afghanistan, now is  not the time to turn our back on NATO.  Beyond straining relations with our closest  allies, this resolution sends an even more dangerous message to Colonel Qaddafi. This resolution is effectively telling a despotic dictator,  who has murdered and terrorized his own citizens, that he can simply wait out the military  effort to protect the Libyan people because the  United States will not hold true to its word.  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, as a combat veteran, and as an American, I will continue to ask the hard questions  of our military and civilian leaders about military operations over Libya. But I will not vote  for a measure that I believe threatens the security and safety of our country and undermines our President.  Mr.  JORDAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker,  more than two months after stating that our  military action in Libya would be over in \u2018\u2018days,  not weeks,\u2019\u2019 President Obama has yet to explain to the American people what our mission  in Libya is, how it will be conducted, and when  it will be completed. He has failed to explain  how our military involvement in Libya fits with  our policy  interests  in  the Middle East and  northern Africa. Most importantly, he has ignored his constitutional responsibility to uphold  federal law by choosing not to acquire authorization  from Congress  for our  involvement  there.  That  is why  I cosponsored Mr. TURNER\u2019s  resolution disapproving of the President\u2019s actions, and that is why I joined my House colleagues today in demanding action from the  President.  The President must follow the law and seek  approval for this military action from Congress.  In doing so, he must explain some basic facts,  such as whether  the  removal of Moammar  Qaddafi  is part of  the mission, how stability  will be promoted in the region if Qaddafi is removed from power, and who among the anti-  Qaddafi forces in Libya should be supported in  the event that he is removed.  Instead of following the clear path of seeking congressional approval as outlined in federal  law,  the President unilaterally escalated  our military efforts in Libya after assuring us  they would be scaled back. Now, some in the  Obama administration are saying we should  put boots on the ground in support of further  NATO actions. This is the opposite of what the  President promised and contrary to the will of  the House.  Congress appropriately shows a certain deference  to  the  commander-in-chief when  it  comes  to national security decisions, as we  must always have  the ability  to quickly  respond to threats to our sovereignty and our interests around  the world. Further, Congress  must  not  direct  troop movements  or  set  timelines for our military operations, as such  decisions should be left to our highly skilled  commanders on  the ground. But our deference  is contingent upon  the President respecting the Founders\u2019 intent for the primary  role of Congress in providing for our defense  and security needs.  It does not change  the  fact that the President is obliged to seek congressional approval and  to explain how our  mission in Libya is vital to our national security.  The brave men and women in our armed  forces, as always, are performing their duties  with  the  greatest  expertise  and  professionalism of any military  in  the world. The  issue at hand is the failure of the President to  seek congressional approval required by law,  and  the  failure of  the President  to  tell Congress and the American people the details of  our mission.  The American people will always stand with  those who seek freedom and self-determination. Today\u2019s vote reaffirms that it is vital the  President obey the rule of law in doing so.  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker,  like  many members of this body, I have been outraged by the President\u2019s failure to comply with  the War Powers Act and to define the U.S.  mission in Libya. This Congress must not neglect its responsibility and authority regarding  the use of force in Libya, and the debate we  are having today is long overdue.  I  think most Americans,  including myself,  agree that seeing Moammar Gadhafi and his  regime of thugs removed from power would be  a good  thing. However,  I  think most Americans, including myself, also feel strongly that  American forces should not be committed to  this kind of mission without the consent of the  U.S. Congress.  Our Founding Fathers envisioned a country  where the executive branch and the legislative  branch share the responsibility regarding the  use of force. President Obama has not sought  the consent of the Congress in terms of involving American forces in Libya and that is  why we are having this debate today.  I rise in support of H. Res. 292. This resolution demands that the President provide answers about our involvement in the conflict in  Libya, including the President\u2019s justification for  not seeking Congressional authorization  for  this action. The resolution gives the President  14 days to respond to this request. The President should take very seriously this resolution.  And our  leadership  in Congress should be  vigilant to demand a full and clear response  from the President. This resolution also gives  adequate notice to NATO and our other allies  of  the concerns of  the House before  the  House takes further action. The further action  must  take note of  the President\u2019s  failure  to  comply with the War Powers Act and notwithstanding that fact must also take note of our  Nation\u2019s foreign policy interests and efforts to  combat terrorism.  H. Res. 292 is an important first step in restoring the balance that our Founding Fathers  envisioned, that our legislative and executive  branches share  the  responsibility  regarding  the use of U.S.  force. However,  the action  taken today should not be the last step. In 14  days, the House of Representatives should reconvene  to evaluate our continued  involvement in Libya. We must then make hard decisions about the operation in Libya and the role  of the United States in this conflict. I hope my  colleagues will  join me  in remaining vigilant  and demanding accountability from the White  House.  Ms.  JACKSON  LEE  of  Texas. Madam  Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H. Con.  Res. 51, \u2018\u2018Directing the President, Pursuant to  Section (c) of the War Powers Resolution, to  remove the United States Armed forces from  Libya,\u2019\u2019 I support the War Powers Resolution  however I cannot support a resolution which  requires the President to withdraw all United  States Armed  forces within 15 days of  its  adoption.  As  the Ranking Member of  the House  Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Senior Member of the  House Judiciary Committee, I believe in supporting the Constitution of the United States.  This Concurrent Resolution  is a reminder  to  the American people that we must firmly hold  true to our constitutional duties. We have the  power  to  ensure  the Executive  does  not  overstep its bounds. As Members of Congress  we can exercise our power through appropriation, the appointment process, exercising oversight over  the Executive, enactment  legislation, or even establishing a select Committee  to probe any abuse of power by the administration.  Presidents, Members of Congress, scholars  and  lawyers had  long argued about which  branch of government has the power to decide  whether the nation goes to war, and meaningful discussions between the branches has not  always taken place.  In 1973, the War Powers Resolution (Public  Law 93\u2013148) was passed over  the veto of  President Nixon,  in order  to provide procedures for Congress and the President to participate  in decisions  to  send U.S. Armed  Forces into hostilities.  Such force is constitutional under the Necessary and Proper Clause which specifically  provided that \u2018\u2018Congress shall have the power  to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution, not only its own powers  but also all other powers vested by the Constitution  in  the Government of  the United  States . . .\u2019\u2019.  The policy behind this power, entrusted to  the President as Commander in Chief, to deploy U.S. armed forces to defend itself is \u2018\u2018exercised only pursuant to: (1) a declaration of  war; (2) specific statutory authorization; or (3)  a national emergency created by attack upon  the United States,  its  territories or possessions, or its armed forces.\u2019\u2019 Pursuant to this  authority, the President \u2018\u2018in every possible instance\u2019\u2019 shall consult with Congress before deploying U.S. Armed Forces, and to continue  consultations as long as the armed forces remain in hostile situations.  As we consider the War Powers Resolution,  we must also consider facts surrounding the  state of violence and unrest in Libya and the  consequences of both action and inaction on  behalf of the Libyan people.  I believe in the Constitution and the importance of maintaining the power of Congress in  asserting when international conflicts warrant  U.S. military  involvement.  I  call upon  the  President to issue a report detailing the current status of the United States military forces  in Libya within the next 30 days.  We must not forget the bloodshed that continues to take place in Libya. The people of  Libya have given their lives in their fight for  democracy. This conflict began in Libya four  months ago when Colonel Gaddafi failed to do  what was right for his country and its people.

Today I think we owe the American  people an apology because we all as a  House are here to defend and protect  the Constitution of the United States  and it has been way too long before  this debate has been had on this floor.  There is much more at risk today  than Libya. What is at risk today is  the very Constitution that we have  sworn to protect and to uphold. If the  Constitution is at risk, then this House  is at risk.  When this House is blatantly ignored  by another branch, by the President of  the United States, then the people are  blatantly ignored by the President of  the United States and this House will  fall.  I applaud those that have sponsored  this resolution, and I rise in support of  it today.  Mr. BERMAN. I reserve the balance  of my time.  Mr. KUCINICH.

For us to be wantonly killing people  around the globe, entering into a war\u2014  there\u2019s no other question about that\u2014  without permission from the American  people through this body is unconstitutional, it\u2019s wrong, and we should support the Kucinich amendment.  Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I am  pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from  Nebraska  (Mr.  FORTENBERRY), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.  Mr. FORTENBERRY.  I  thank  the  gentleman from California, our ranking member on Foreign Affairs, for the  time.  Madam Speaker, this is a very tough  call, a  tough  set of  circumstances.  There is much complexity here with  the convergence of war and diplomacy  and geopolitics and allied relations.  What is clear, however, is that the  President has not communicated effectively with the United States Congress,  nor has he sought this body\u2019s authorization for the undertaking in Libya.  Let\u2019s have a brief history lesson here,  though: Some in this body called for  unilateral action against Libya just 3  months ago. That was appropriately resisted  by  this  administration until  other nations, particularly the British  and the French, were willing to put up  their own assets and give structure to  a NATO coalition.  However, now U.S. actions, in an important allied effort to save Libyan civilians from imminent slaughter, have  clearly moved beyond the scope of humanitarian relief and stabilization efforts.  With that said, an abrupt and imminent cut-off of U.S. participation  in  Libya causes numerous complications  and would be highly disruptive. Yet we  should not creep, we must not creep toward opening up a third front in Libya,  which is the root cause of this debate.  The general framework for intervention without express congressional authorization has precedent and  some  parallels within the last 30 years. Let\u2019s  look at Lebanon in 1982, Panama in  1989, Bosnia in 1995, and Kosova in 1999.  All of these interventions had various  levels of controversy, particularly the  one in Lebanon; but they were undertaken  by Presidents  of  the United  States.  The Boehner resolution, considered  before this one, gives the President a  small window of time to better make  thank  the genhis case. If the President cannot, Congress can assert its authority and disapprove.  Raising principled questions about  war powers is a laudable goal, and I do  want to commend the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. KUCINICH) for his leadership  in this important debate. It would not  have happened without him.  However, I think we should move forward  very  carefully.  Speaker  BOEHNER\u2019s resolution pushes the President for answers but stops short of requesting  congressional  authorization  or abrupt withdrawal of U.S. participation in the Libya mission. If this approach is unfruitful, we can then exercise further options.  Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker,  I  yield  11\u20442minutes  to  the gentleman  from Massachusetts  (Mr. CAPUANO),  who has been a driving force behind  this resolution.  Mr. CAPUANO.  I  tleman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I am proud to be  one of the original cosponsors of this  resolution. But I want to be honest, I  take no pleasure in this. I\u2019m an early  and ardent supporter of the President  on most everything. This has nothing  to do, in my mind, with the President  or, truthfully, even with the action in  Libya. For me, this is about the Constitution, plain and simple.  The Constitution  is clear. It\u2019s not  even about the War Powers Act. I personally think the War Powers Act is  probably unconstitutional. The Constitution is clear. On many things it\u2019s  not. It is unequivocally clear that the  declaration of war is the responsibility  of Congress, period. No gray area there.  Now, I know you can try to fudge on  what the definition of war is, but when  someone is shooting at someone else,  that\u2019s war. If it\u2019s one person, 10 people,  or 10 million, that\u2019s war. For me, that\u2019s  what this is about.  Now, don\u2019t get me wrong. I would  hesitate strongly\u2014I doubt that I would  support the action in Libya. But that\u2019s  not why I cosponsored this.  And I\u2019ve had some people say, well, 15  days is unreasonable. Well, okay. Then  if this passes, they have 15 days to  come back to us and ask us for more  time, which I would be inclined to do if  that\u2019s necessary on a military basis.  b1300  What this simply says is that Congress has to stand up on our own two  feet and take the actions that we took  an oath to take, which is to uphold the  Constitution.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. KUCINICH. I yield the gentleman  an additional 30 seconds.  Mr. CAPUANO. Now,  I understand  that people may see things differently  and I respect people that would differ,  but I cannot believe that anyone can  honestly read the Constitution on this  matter in an unclear way.  Congress has the authority to declare  war, period. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here today.

            "36": "H4024  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE June 3, 2011  important to communicate with your  colleagues, so let me be as clear as I  can be.  As I heard my friends on the other  side of the aisle, one after one, claim  that the Libyan war was the President\u2019s war, well, today, on June 3, 2011,  the President of the United States happens to be President Obama. Yet if you  look at the Constitution of the United  States, which provides provisions for  the separation of powers, there is a section that articulates that the Congress,  irrespective of any Presidential person  in place, declares war.  So I would ask my friends on the  other side of the aisle: Would they have  been as quick to rise to the floor on the  Iraq war, which could be called the  \u2018\u2018Bush war\u2019\u2019? or the continued 10-year  plus war  in Afghanistan  the  \u2018\u2018Bush  war\u2019\u2019?  When we discuss these issues for the  American people, we have to be true to  ourselves and the Constitution. There  was a reason the Founding Fathers separated out the right to declare war.  That reason, of course, was to protect  you, the American people. When we  send men and women into battle, it  should be a deliberative process, but we  should also have the right to defend  ourselves.  The initial attack in Afghanistan\u2014  that was the first act\u2014was in response  to the heinous and horrific attack of al  Qaeda on the soil of the United States.  From my perspective, the immediate  response of President Bush was legitimate. The  question  becomes: What  came afterwards? The Congress was  never given the chance to declare war.  Subsequently, there was a statutory  discussion and vote that gave unending  opportunities and authority  for  the  war to go on and on and on.  b1410  Buried in the Afghanistan decision  was the authority to go on and on and  on. The sad part about it was that we  did not go on in Afghanistan. We distracted our troops and went into a war  that saw the large numbers of our soldiers lose their lives in a war that had  actually never been declared by the  United States  of America  and  the  United States Congress.  We have  something  today  in  2011  called the Arab Spring. But I don\u2019t  think Americans understand that, and  they, frankly, believe that we cannot  promote democracy everywhere in the  world. Policymakers understand  the  crucialness of what is going on in the  Arab area as  it relates to the geopolitics, the political structure of the  world.  But I know what Americans of goodwill do understand: the slaughter of a  people. The slaughter and the misuse of  power in Bahrain; the misuse of power  in Egypt;  the  gruesome misuse  of  power to the extent that a mutilated  body  of  a  13-year-old  boy  can  be  dumped  in  their  parents\u2019  home  in  Syria; and, yes, the violence in Libya.  Americans understand that and I understand it.  So I applaud the President of the  United States for going in in Libya to  stop the horrific violence. He went in  in coalition with our NATO troops.  That same action occurred under President Clinton, going in with NATO, taking the lead in this instance, in the  slaughter of Muslims in Kosova and the  horrible wars in Bosnia.  I happened to have been able to go on  an initial inaugural mission into Bosnia\u2014the former Yugoslavia\u2014and Croatia, and I walked the streets of Sarajevo and I saw mothers who had not  seen their sons for 10 or 12 years and  asked us where they were. It was a violent time.  So the Libyan action by the President was an appropriate one. He happens to be a Democratic President. I  applaud his action. But the Constitution is not labeled by Democratic or  Republican. It has no provisions to exempt if you happen to be a Democrat  with a Democratic President. So my  values argue for consistency, and that  is adhering to the Constitution.  I  believe  Resolution  292,  Mr.  BOEHNER\u2019s resolution that was crafted  in the last 24 hours, was a nice statement about a report. But I don\u2019t vote  on actions on the floor out of contempt  and dislike for anyone.  Let me be very clear. I applaud President Barack Obama  for the courage  that he has taken in moving forward to  establish America\u2019s mark as a believer  in democracy and justice and encouraging the people in the Arab States to  stand up for their rights and to object  and reject the oppressiveness of their  regimes, and I hope that NATO becomes strategic in what they\u2019re doing  so that we can be successful.  But if we are going to be true to the  Constitution of the United States that  is, in fact, part of the document that  we hold true, then we must hold any  Commander in Chief to the same standard.  The War Powers Resolution asks that  the President of  the United States  come to the Congress within 60 days.  The constitutional provision in article  II requires that the Congress declare  war. One could argue that we have not  declared war on Arab States and we\u2019ve  not declared war on Libya. We\u2019re at  war. We\u2019re at war because al Qaeda declares that they are at war with us. So  it is a dicey circumstance.  I,  instead, voted  for the action to  occur under the War Powers Resolution  that was just occurring today, a vote  that we lost, a vote that I would have  voted for under President Bush, under  President  Reagan,  under  President  Carter,  and with  the  opportunity,  under President Clinton, as the wars  proceeded to a long extent of time.  However, we are dealing now in the  backdrop of a failed resolution. But I  voted because it is necessary to be consistent as to whether you believe the  Constitution and the authority of the  Congress and the separation of three  branches is a valid one to protect the  rights of the American people. And I  believe that.  But my message to General Qadhafi  is this: If you have any sense of human  dignity  left, you will stop the murderous attacks on your people. I am  sensitive enough to offer my sympathy  to you for the loss of your family members because I believe in the value of  human life. War is ugly. But every effort of peace that we have made has  been one that you\u2019ve ignored. Every effort that we have made, every step that  we have taken toward peace you have  ignored. You have arrogantly insisted  on  the world  stage  that you\u2019re  in  charge, while your country is in a state  of confusion and disaster. You have  opened the doors to the confusion and  the violence of terrorist cells, al Qaeda  and other ne\u2019er-do-wells who desire no  good to you or your people. You\u2019ve allowed groups to, in essence, begin to  spark so that the continued frustration  of world leaders in trying to bring resolution  continues;  but, more  importantly, the violence of all falls on the  backs of innocent women and children,  young boys and families in Libya.  I feel a kinship to the Libyan people,  as a human being and as  someone  whose heritage  started on  the continent of Africa. But  the one good  thing about America is that we care  about all people no matter what background  they come  from, no matter  what country. I know that because I\u2019ve  had the privilege of representing the  United States  in South and Central  America, in Asia, on the continent of  Africa, in the Mideast and Europe and  other places maybe not mentioned\u2014because we care.  Mr. Qadhafi, I beg of you, as an African who has met with the President of  South Africa, who knows that the African Union would like for you to cease  and desist this violent attack on your  own people, stand down. And I would  ask, as I have asked before, leave the  country. Let us find the kind of government  that might,  in  fact, move  Libya forward. And if your people decide that you should stay, then you  should  have  a  reformation  and  a  change not only of mind but of heart.  The violence does not get you anywhere and it is both insane and absurd.  So I would hope that as this vote was  taken, that it is not in any way, as was  evidenced by the discussion in the debate by the Republicans, it is not Mr.  Obama\u2019s war. He is the President of the  United States and the Commander in  Chief, and it was a determination to go  in to stop the murderous acts of those  who were killing innocent people.  Read your early history. The early  Founders of this Nation in the Revolutionary War against Great Britain had  other countries come to the aid of this  little, tiny, baby series of States that  called themselves the United States of  America. It has been the world order  for  centuries  that big  countries or  those who are able will go to the aid of  those who are not able. And this vote  today should not in any way deny the  respect that is owed to the President of  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:29 Jun 04, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K03JN7.080 H03JNPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",

As a SWIC Trustee, Mr. Roehrkasse has  enthusiastically worked with  faculty, administration and staff on  the Strategic Planning  Committee since  its  inception. He helped  to  update existing and develop new Board policies and procedures to address strategic planning priorities.  Mr. Roehrkasse has been a consistent, active participant  in helping SWIC maintain  its  longstanding  accreditation with  the Higher  Learning Commission  (HLC),  and  achieve  model-institution recognition from the HLC for  its Academic Quality  Improvement Program  (AQIP) initiatives and achievements.  With his background  in  Information Technology, Mr. Roehrkasse has been a  longstanding champion of  IT\u2014from smart-classrooms to community-wide applications\u2014helping to establish SWIC as one of the leading  IT-supported community colleges in the state  and the nation.

ED PASTOR  OFARIZONA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2011  Friday, June 3, 2011  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor Mr. Carmen A. Policy, who received  the prestigious National Education and Leadership Award from the Sons of Italy Foundation on May 25th. This award is presented by  the foundation annually to the Italian American  who has upheld a commitment to educational  excellence, leadership and the betterment of  society. Previous recipients of this outstanding  award  include  Joe  Paterno  and  Antonin  Scalia.  Mr. Policy, a native of Youngstown and  Ohio\u2019s 17th district, graduated  from Youngstown State University  in 1963, and  in 1966  earned  his  Juris Doctorate Degree  from  Georgetown University Law Center here  in  Washington, DC. For many years, he pursued  a successful law practice career in Ohio.  In 1983, Carmen traded in the courtroom for  the gridiron and became Vice President of the  San Francisco 49ers.  In 1991 he became  President and CEO of the franchise. As an executive in the 49ers organization, Mr. Policy  played a key role in delivering 4 Super Bowl  trophies back to the city of San Francisco. In  1994 he was named  the National Football  League Executive of the Year by The Sporting  News and GQ listed him as one of the most  powerful men in professional sports. In 1998,  Carmen became President and CEO of  the  Cleveland Browns and during his  five years  with the Browns, he served as a member of  the NFL\u2019s Finance, Business Ventures, and  Super Bowl Advisory Committees.  After 25 years in the NFL, Carmen, along  with his wife Gail, began a new life of wine  making  in  the Napa Valley and  the couple  founded the Casa Piena Winery. The roots of  Casa Piena go back to Policy\u2019s childhood in  Youngstown\u2019s Smokey Hollow neighborhood,  where the making and sharing of wine played  a central part in the vibrant family life of this  largely Italian-American community.  He has sent a strong and clean message to  the youth of the Mahoning Valley; if you work  hard, play by the rules and get a good education, America will reward you with all  the  blessings of this great land.  Mr. Speaker,  today  I  rise  to congratulate  and honor the hard work and dedication of Mr.  Carmen Policy and his wife Gail. I invite my  colleagues  to  join me  in  recognition of  this  award.  Mr. PASTOR of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor Raul Hector Castro, Arizona\u2019s  first Hispanic Governor, on the occasion of his  95th birthday on June 12, 2011. Raul Castro\u2019s  legacy is imbedded in my home State\u2019s history  for his high achievements despite the racism  he experienced as a young Mexican immigrant  raised  in Arizona. Besides holding Arizona\u2019s  highest State office, Governor Castro served  as a United States Ambassador three times:  to El Salvador, Bolivia, and Argentina. Last  year, Governor Castro was honored with the  prestigious Cesar E. Chavez Legacy Award at  the Ninth Annual Cesar E. Chavez Foundation  Gala in Phoenix. In addition, Governor Castro  received  the Arizona Legacy Award at  the  52nd Annual Arizona Hispanic Chamber of  Commerce\u2019s Black and White Ball.  Governor Castro and co-author Dr. Jack August, Jr. have written a fascinating biography  entitled \u2018\u2018Adversity Is My Angel: The Life and  Career of Raul H. Castro.\u2019\u2019 The book traces  the astounding  life of  the  former Governor  through his childhood as a Mexican immigrant  in a harsh  land  to his election as Governor  and Presidentially appointed Ambassador.  It  chronicles how he overcame personal and racial prejudice to rise to the highest levels of  accomplishment.  During the last couple of years, the former  Governor has been on a mission to visit and  speak with middle school and high school students and encourage them to stay in school  and get an education. Governor Castro has  visited several schools throughout the State of  Arizona sharing his  legacy and more  importantly stressing  the value and  importance of  an education. Education  is a  top priority of  Governor Castro, and the Institute that carries  his name is housed at Phoenix College. The  Raul H. Castro Institute is focused on improving the quality of life for the Latino community  in Arizona and educating and strengthening  partners that serve the Latino community by  fostering  connections with  research  institutions, promoting best practice dissemination,  and  impacting policy decisions  in education,  health and human services,  leadership, and  civic participation.  The Honorable Raul H. Castro continues to  provide vision and leadership in the State of  Arizona, and I ask my colleagues today to join  me in recognizing his life\u2019s accomplishments  and his 95th birthday.  \u2211 This \u2018\u2018bullet\u2019\u2019 symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

Happy 200th Birthday Mrs. Stowe.  f  GOOD INTENTIONS GONE HAYWIRE  HON. JACK KINGSTON  OFGEORGIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2011  Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to  submit an article which explains some of the  problems and unintended consequences of  the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111\u2013203).  [From Forbes Magazine, by Mallory Factor]  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform &  Consumer Protection Act  is  supposed  to  shield consumers from problems in the financial services sector that many believe led to  the financial meltdown. But Section 342 of  the act introduces a brash example of social  engineering that masquerades as consumer  protection and financial reform. This section  imposes  gender  and  racial  employment  quotas on the  financial services  industry,  which accounts for one-tenth of our economy. The quota provisions will affect over  50,000 financial services firms and other businesses, and the consequences will be enormous.  Dodd-Frank requires at least 29 federal bureaus to open Offices of Minority & Women  Inclusion,  involving  ten branches of  the  Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve  and its 12 regional banks, the Securities &  Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The new diversity offices will implement rules to ensure \u2018\u2018the fair  inclusion and utilization\u2019\u2019 of minorities and  women in all firms doing business with each  agency. The offices will terminate contracts  with any service provider that fails to meet  these as yet undetermined standards. Just  running these offices is estimated to cost  over $58 million annually, says David Patten  in a recent story on Newsmax.com.  These new offices will also assess the \u2018\u2018diversity policies and practices\u2019\u2019 at all entities  that fall under their regulatory eye, including banks, broker-dealers, registered investment advisors and now hedge funds. Along  with more  than  40,000  financial  services  firms, another 10,000-plus businesses, including accounting and law firms that do business with these government offices, will be  subject to this new diversity oversight of  their hiring.  What does this mean for the financial services sector? Assuming each  firm hires at  least one new worker to satisfy the new law,  this provision could raise costs $4 billion or  more annually, depending how  far  forthcoming regulations will extend. Firms doing  business with the government will face additional expenses because they will now have  to monitor the hiring practices of their subcontractors as well. In addition to these reporting burdens, firms must prove to their  regulators and to government offices with  which they do business that they are meeting or working toward racial and gender hiring guidelines. In many cases this will require additional hiring beyond the needs of  the business.  Forcing America\u2019s private firms to hire on  the basis of racial and gender \u2018\u2018guidelines,\u2019\u2019  rather than solely on need and qualifications, is inefficient and makes our businesses  less competitive than their global counterparts. Moreover, four out of the eight members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights  wrote a letter to Congress stating that this  section of the act would likely \u2018\u2018promote discrimination,\u2019\u2019 and urged its removal from  the bill.  There is a better, more cost-efficient solution: Let private companies come up with  their own approaches. Deloitte\u2019s 19-year-old  Women\u2019s Initiative, for example, has boosted  the percentage of female partners, principals  and directors from 7% in 1994 to 23% in 2010.  And minorities and females currently make  up 60% of kpmg\u2019s workforce.  While the idea of encouraging greater participation of minorities and women in the financial services sector is admirable, the government is overreaching when it mandates  gender and racial quotas for private businesses. An affirmative action provision has  no place in a financial services reform bill  and puts additional government burdens and  costs on an already struggling sector of our  economy, putting our recovery at risk.  The megabills that fly through Congress  provide legislators the opportunity to insert  politically motivated provisions\u2014under the  radar. As Rahm Emanuel famously said after  President Obama had been elected, \u2018\u2018Never  allow a crisis to go to waste.\u2019\u2019 The financial  crisis has given the President and Congress  cover to impose their political agenda on private business activity. Watch out: Your industry could be next.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON  OFIDAHO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2011  Mr. SIMPSON.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Courtney C. Brown has  provided mentorship  to our youth and much  needed guidance for our elderly. He stands for  the  empowerment  of  our  community  and  healthy development of our families.

She continued working in Galindo\u2019s  grocery store until her marriage  to Nicolas  Silva, Jr. in 1947. The couple had two daughters and owned and operated a Texaco Service Station, where she served as  the bookkeeper.  Mrs. Silva worked for Rio Grande City Independent School District as a teacher\u2019s aide in  their pre-school department and continued to  teach once  the program was annexed by  Headstart.

Throughout her  career,  she  volunteered  for  her  neighborhood\u2019s 4\u2013H Youth Development Organization  and frequently acted as judge in the program\u2019s  float and craft competitions. Her dedication to  children inspired her two daughters to emulate  their mother\u2019s passion and attain masters degrees in Education.  In addition to her passion for children, Mrs.  Silva was an avid arrowhead hunter\u2014a passion her husband and children all enjoyed.

JO BONNER  OFALABAMA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2011  Mr. BONNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor  the work of Thomas Davis Jr., a respected  leader in his field and an outstanding citizen of  Mobile, Alabama.  Mr. Davis recently retired as President and  CEO of the nonprofit Community Foundation  of South Alabama, an organization which has  flourished under his guidance over the past 27  years. Beginning as  the program\u2019s development director in 1984, Tom quickly rose to become its executive director in 1985 and went  on to become the president of the foundation  in 2008.  Under his direction, the foundation\u2019s assets  increased from $3 million to over $50 million.  Even more  impressive  is  the growth of  the  foundation\u2019s  charitable  funds  and  endowments. By the time he left office, this number  had gone from 60 funds and endowments to  over 400.  Mr. Davis\u2019 success  is  the product of hard  work, an exceptional work ethic and an unparalleled ability to lead, which proved handy during his oversight of foundation programs that  provided assistance  to earthquake and  tsunami victims  in Japan as well as  those recently affected by  the Gulf oil spill. He was  also instrumental in obtaining health insurance  for local underprivileged children.  It would be a hard task to designate one of  his many achievements as being his greatest,  for Tom accomplished so much throughout his  tenure. However, the nonprofit\u2019s recognition as  a \u2018\u2018Partnership to Build Community Capital\u2019\u2019 by  the Kresge Foundation  is a distinct honor,  placing  the Community Foundation of South  Alabama in an elite group of which there are  only six such programs nationally.  On behalf of the people of Mobile, I want to  thank Tom Davis  for his service and wish  him\u2014and his family\u2014continued success in the  years to come.  f  A TRIBUTE TO MRS. KATHLEEN  BATEMAN  HON. BRETT GUTHRIE  OFKENTUCKY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2011  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor a great Kentuckian, Mrs. Kathleen Bateman. After 33 years of teaching, Mrs. Bateman will retire leaving behind a legacy of dedication to her students and her community.  Mrs. Bateman graduated from Murray State  University in 1977 with a Bachelor of Arts in  Education and earned her Master\u2019s in Counseling  from Western Kentucky University  in  1986. She obtained her Rank I in Art through  the National Board for Professional Teaching  Standards in 1990.  Mrs. Bateman\u2019s most recent position was at  East Hardin Middle School,  but  she  has  touched  the  lives  of  countless  students  throughout her career while teaching at several elementary and middle schools  in  the  Commonwealth.  A great teacher has the power to affect students  throughout  their  academic  journey,  opening new horizons and starting them on a  positive path with high expectations for the future.  Mrs. Bateman did just that with the unwavering commitment she gave her students.  It  takes a special person and a tremendous level  of perseverance to be an educator\u2014qualities  that Ms. Bateman  exuded  throughout  her  years of hard work.  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring  Mrs. Kathleen Bateman  for her many great  contributions  to  the Commonwealth of Kentucky and  for contributing  to  the success of  many young people in our community.  f  INTRODUCING THE \u2018\u2018SALMON  SOLUTIONS AND PLANNING ACT\u2019\u2019  HON. JIM McDERMOTT  OFWASHINGTON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2011  Mr. MCDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, salmon are  one of America\u2019s most precious but delicate  resources. Since the construction of four Federal dams on the lower Snake River in Washington State, certain salmon species have become extinct. Others continue to see drastic  declines  in number. Today,  thirteen salmon  and steelhead species  in  the Columbia and  Snake River Basin are  listed  for protection  under the Endangered Species Act. If we do  not act now, we stand to lose this valuable resource  forever, which  is why  I am  reintroducing the Salmon Solutions Planning Act.  Salmon and  steelhead populations have  major economic, environmental and cultural  significance to the Pacific Northwest. Generations of fishermen have relied on salmon as  an integral part of their communities along the  west coast. Today, even at their current depressed levels, salmon add hundreds of millions of dollars to the American economy and  remain  an  essential  part  of  communities  around the Northwest. If we restore these populations to their original levels their economic  benefits will reach well  into  the billions and  these communities will be able  to continue  their rich traditions.  Already we recognize the importance of preserving  this precious  resource. The Federal  Government and  ratepayers  in  the Pacific  Northwest have spent more than $10 billion in  salmon recovery efforts on the Columbia and  Snake River Basin. These efforts, while commendable, have done  little  to help salmon  populations recover. This legislation commissions studies to focus our efforts so that all  factors are  taken  into account when considering removal. It is critical that our salmon recovery efforts be informed, cost effective, and  successful.  Without action, scientists estimate that several of the salmon populations could be extinct  in less than 20 years. The time to act is now.  Salmon are the lifeblood of the Pacific Northwest, and we, as a country, cannot afford to  lose this national treasure.  f  CONGRATULATING NORB ASCHOM  FOR  EXCELLENCE  IN  RADIO  BROADCASTING  HON. RON KIND  OFWISCONSIN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2011  Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Norb Aschom  for 50 years of excellence  in  radio broadcasting. Norb has been news director of WPRE\u2013AM and WQPC\u2013FM  radio  stations since 1962. Throughout his  time at  the station, Norb has served a critical role by  providing  this  tight knit  town with  the news  each day,  installing a sense of community  through the airwaves.  Norb  is a  fixture  in  the Prairie du Chien  community, a town in southwestern Wisconsin  on the banks of the Mississippi River. At 71  years of age, Norb has worked in the same  building every day  for 50 years. While his  broadcasting home on St. Feriole  Island  in  Prairie du Chien was recently flooded, he was  forced, along with the rest of the station staff,  out of their office and into a temporary workspace in the local Police Department. After a  two week hiatus, Norb was able to return to  his normal office on April 23. Throughout his  time working out of the police department he  never veered  from his commitment  to bring  the news to the people of Prairie du Chien.  In his 50 years, Norb has interviewed everyone  from  former First Ladies Johnson and  Carter, to fellow radio personality Paul Harvey.

However, changes to programs, as defined under the current farm bill, especially when it comes to the mandatory  spending in this amendment, I believe  should be handled by the Agriculture  Committee,  not  the  appropriations  process. I  fully support this amendment and request my colleagues to do  the same.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Chair,  I  move to strike the last word.  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  from  Georgia is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Chair,  I  want to, first of all, thank my good  friend from Pennsylvania for talking to  me about this amendment. Earlier this  week, I expressed my concerns at that  time, which I still have with it, and  want to make a number of points.  Number one, we\u2019re not 100 percent  sure what this scores out in terms of  budget authority. So  there  is  that  question over it. Number two, I want to  say that while conservation funding is  down, farmers still have access to $5.8  billion  in conservation  funding. And  that\u2019s  for private  landowners. Actually, it\u2019s $5.868 billion, to be exact.  I also want to make sure that my  friends know that even though there  are CHIMPs in this, changes in mandatory programs, that no conservation  contracts will have to be canceled because of these limitations. The Federal  Government cannot and does not break  farm commodity or conservation contracts  without  significant  consequences. We are aware of that. So we  have made sure that none of the conservation  contracts would  be  abrogated.  And then finally I want to say to my  friend the ranking member, just to underscore some of the sensitivities that  we\u2019ve been through in the last couple  of days, that this actually does cut the  WIC  program,  cuts  the Commodity  Supplemental Food Program, and  it  cuts  the Conservation Reserve Program and a lot of the other programs  which there has been so much passion  about on this floor in the last couple of  days.  So with that, I do oppose the amendment, and I urge everyone to vote \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019  on it.  Mr. FARR. I move to strike the last  word.  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  from  California is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. FARR. Madam Chair, I rise with  great concern for this amendment. It  wants  to  reduce  about  5.8  percent  across the board. Our problem is that  we have dealt a really bad deal. The  bill that we brought to the floor\u2014and  we cut  some  last night across  the  board\u2014is $5 billion, or 23 percent below  what  the President  requested. The  President put together all of the asks,  and as you know, OMB scrubs those  things. And we\u2019re always very critical  of the President\u2019s requests, sometimes  because they\u2019re so  low. Nonetheless,  this is 23 percent below what the President requested. It\u2019s 14 percent below  what we enacted last year.  We in the committee last year, under  ROSADELAURO, when we were in the  majority, we didn\u2019t have the impact on  farm programs, particularly the environmental programs, that the cuts do  this year. It\u2019s below the 2010-enacted  level, and it\u2019s actually below the 2008-  enacted level.  You know, people use these terms  very  loosely,  \u2018\u2018below  a  level.\u2019\u2019 But  think of it in your own personal income. Think about what the costs of  life were for you in 2008 versus now.  And I would submit that almost  in  every case, your water bill, your cable  bill, your garbage bill, your utility bill,  certainly the price of gasoline now, is a  lot higher than it was in 2008. Nonetheless, you\u2019ve got the same amount of  money. So it\u2019s going to have a draconian impact, this amendment and the  underlying bill, on the Department of  Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration.  So I\u2019m concerned. I think the gentleman is well intended to protect the  programs  that  I  care a great deal  about. But  I  think  the  5.8 percent  across-the-board cut on top of what  we\u2019ve already cut is just too much.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the  amendment offered by the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. HOLDEN).  The question was  taken; and  the  Chair announced  that  the noes appeared to have it.  Mr. HOLDEN.

The Clerk read as follows:  I  At the end of the bill (before any short  title), insert the following new section:  The amount otherwise provided by this Act  for  \u2018\u2018Agricultural Programs, Animal  and  Plant Health  Inspection Service, Salaries  and  Expenses\u2019\u2019  is  hereby  reduced  by  $11,000,000.  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  from  California is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam Chair, this  amendment really ought to be a no-  brainer. It cuts $11 million from the  USDA Wildlife Services\u2019 livestock protection program. Let me give you four  reasons why  this  should  be  a no-  brainer.  First of all, it saves $11 million. Not  the end of the world, but it\u2019s a start.  We all know we have to save a lot of  money. We all know we have to spend  less money, and this is a start for doing  it. Now why does it do that? Why do we  cut $11 million from this? This program  is taxpayer money used to kill potential  predators  that  supposedly  are  threatening livestock. But this killing  of predators  is very  indiscriminate.  We\u2019re killing all kinds of wildlife out  there, both predators and nonpredators, both threatening and nonthreatening. Third,  less than 1 percent of  livestock in America is killed by predators every year. So we\u2019re spending this  money for a tiny, tiny portion of the  livestock  that  is  out  there.  And  fourth\u2014and this is almost the biggest  reason\u2014why are taxpayers paying this?  Why is this a taxpayer responsibility?  If ranchers want to protect their livestock, why don\u2019t they do it? Why don\u2019t  they pay for it?  Madam Chair,  there are  so many  ways to protect these livestock\u2014with  pens and with fencing, with lighting,  with all kinds of things\u2014without indiscriminately killing wildlife and without using taxpayer money to do  it.  Madam Chair, this is $11 million we can  save, should save, and will save if this  amendment is approved.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Mrs. LUMMIS. Madam Chairman, I  rise in opposition to the amendment.  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from  Wyoming is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mrs. LUMMIS. Madam Chairman, the  gentleman  from California would be  correct,  that  ranchers  and  farmers  should be able to pay to deal with the  predator  situation. The problem  is,  they\u2019re not allowed to.  b0930  The  Federal  Government  doesn\u2019t  allow people to kill predators that are  attacking  their  livestock.  So  consequently, here\u2019s another situation just  like we discussed yesterday, where the  government puts restrictions on ranchers and farmers so they cannot protect  their own livestock. So the taxpayers\u2014  because of their demands that ranchers  and farmers not protect their own livestock, the Federal Government steps  in.  In addition, though, wildlife strikes  on  airplanes  cost U.S.  commercial  aviation $700 million a year. One part  of Wildlife Services  is when USDA  works with 822 domestic airports, as  well as Department of Defense air  bases in the U.S. and in Iraq and in Afghanistan. So part of this is to assist  with efforts  to prevent conflict between wildlife and commercial aviation  flights, some of which can be quite devastating and deadly.  Furthermore, there\u2019s been an $18 million loss of sheep and lands to predators, or $111 million when you add cattle and calf  losses. Absent predator  management, losses would explode, and  that would drive  family  farms and  ranchers out of business.  This is a very balanced program in  terms of  the approach  it  takes  to  shared responsibility between airport  managers and Wildlife Services, ranchers and farmers and Wildlife Services.  It requires a tremendous cost share or  matching program at greater than 40  percent.

            "12": "H4292  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE June 16, 2011  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I also rise in  opposition to this amendment, and I  associate myself with the remarks of  the gentlelady from South Dakota.  I believe  that with  the economic  challenges that our country has felt,  much of which is related to the cost of  fuel, this is an amendment that I think  undermines our ability to recover and  to create jobs.  In our  rural  community down  in  Mitchell County, Georgia, we have an  ethanol facility there which contributes a tremendous amount to the local  economy. It hires people and it is, I  think, the example of how we grow our  rural economy. In  fact, this amendment would  stop  that kind of  job  growth. It would not allow this facility  to expand and to be prosperous, and I  just think that it\u2019s the wrong way to  go.  When America  and  the American  economy gets sick and gets a cold, the  rural economy has pneumonia and it\u2019s  on life support, and we need to make  sure that\u2014we had some 30, 40, 50, 60 individuals in rural Georgia who decided  that they wanted to invest their own  money in a home grown industry for  renewable energy, so that we would be  in a position to contribute to our own  energy self-sufficiency and we would be  able to do it in a way where our local  individuals would be able to create jobs  and to increase the economy there in  our  local  rural  community.  It has  worked very well except for the fact  that  they don\u2019t have  the  facilities,  don\u2019t have the pumps, and we need to  make sure that they do.  This amendment I think is pennywise  and pound foolish, and I think that we  need to go ahead and move ahead to  help our country become energy self-  sufficient. How do we do that? By making sure that consumers do have access  to the blends so that we will not continually have to fight with the Middle  East for the cost of fuel. Oil prices really are battering our economy. Energy  costs are battering our economy. It\u2019s  also battering our national security.  When you look at how many billions of  gallons of fuel are spent for our national security with our military vehicles, our weapons, we need to have alternative energy sources, and I think  this amendment undermines that.  I oppose  it and I associate myself  with all those who oppose this amendment. I think that we need to move  forward with energy  self-sufficiency,  energy independence for our country.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the  amendment offered by the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. FLAKE).  The question was  taken; and  the  Chair announced  that  the noes appeared to have it.  Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chair, I demand  a recorded vote.  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of  rule XVIII, further proceedings on the  amendment offered by the gentleman  from Arizona will be postponed.  b1040  AMENDMENTOFFEREDBYMR. GARDNER  Mr. GARDNER. Madam Chair, I have  an amendment at the desk.  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the  amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  At the end of the bill (before the short  title), insert the following new section:  SEC. ll. The amount otherwise provided  by this Act for  \u2018\u2018Integrated Activities\u2019\u2019 is  hereby increased by, and the amount otherwise provided by this Act for \u2018\u2018National Institute of Food and Agriculture-research and  education activities\u2019\u2019 is hereby reduced (to  be derived  from amounts  for competitive  grants (7 U.S.C. 22 450i(b))) by, $4,400,000, respectively.  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. GARDNER. Madam Chair, this  amendment moves funding over to the  integrated  activities  account.  I  am  very concerned about our work when it  comes to animal disease and food safety issues, especially when it relates to  issues like FMD, chronic waste and disease, mad cow disease, other infectious  animal diseases, prion-based diseases.  I want to make sure that we are not  imperiling the U.S. livestock industry,  especially when it comes to our livestock exports. If we were to delay even  just 3 to 4 days in terms of finding or  responding to an outbreak of FMD, it  could cost our country $135 billion in  agriculture and possibly destroy our  export markets.  Madam Chair, I would just ask for a  \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 vote on the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the  amendment offered by the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. GARDNER).  The amendment was agreed to.  AMENDMENTNO. 26OFFEREDBYMR. FLORES  Mr. FLORES. Madam Chairman,  have an amendment at the desk.  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate  the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  I  At the end of the bill (before the short  title), add the following new section:  SEC. 4ll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to enforce section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (Public Law 110\u2013140; 42  U.S.C. 17142).  from  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. FLORES.  I  rise  to offer my  amendment, which would address another restrictive and misguided Federal regulation.  Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act prohibits Federal agencies from entering into contracts for the procurement of an alternative fuel unless its \u2018\u2018lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions\u2019\u2019 are less than or  equal to emissions from an equivalent  conventional fuel produced from conventional petroleum sources. Simply  put, my amendment would stop the  government from enforcing the ban on  the U.S. Department of Agriculture  and all other Federal agencies funded  by the Ag appropriations bill.  The initial purpose of section 526 was  to  stifle  the Defense Department\u2019s  plans to buy and develop coal-based, or  coal-to-liquids, jet fuels, based on the  opinion of environmentalists that coal-  based  jet  fuel produces more greenhouse gas emissions than traditional  petroleum. Earlier this week, I offered  my  similar  amendment  to  the  MILCON\u2013VA approps bill, and it passed  this House by a voice vote.  My friend from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY)  also had language added to the defense  authorization bill to exempt the Defense Department  from  this burdensome regulation. We must ensure that  our military  becomes  energy  independent and can efficiently rely on domestic and more stable sources of fuel.  But section 526\u2019s ban on fuel choice applies to all Federal agencies, not just  the Defense Department. This is why I  am  offering  this  amendment  again  today.  While we hope the USDA is not going  to be fueling up any jets any time soon,  the underlying bill does allow for the  purchase of more than 400 new passenger vehicles. The Department of Agriculture\u2019s  choice on  fuel  to power  these vehicles to provide service to our  Nation\u2019s farmers and agricultural producers will be  limited without my  amendment.  The USDA should not be burdened  with wasting  its time studying  fuel  emissions when there\u2019s a simple  fix,  and that\u2019s not to restrict their  fuel  choices  based  on  extreme  environmental views, policies, and regulations  like section 526.  Madam Chairman, section 526 makes  our Nation more dependent on Middle  Eastern oil. And stopping the impact of  section  526 would help us  promote  American energy, improve the American economy, and create American  jobs. I urge my colleagues to support  the  passage  of  this  commonsense  amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. FARR. I rise in opposition to the  amendment, Madam Chair.  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  from  California is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. FARR. Madam Chair, look, if you  like dirty air, you will love this amendment. If you like dirty fuel, you will  love this amendment.  What this provision does is it strikes  the requirement in law that says to the  government, which is a big purchaser  of fuel, look, don\u2019t buy dirty fuel. Buy  something that is clean. I mean, that\u2019s  what we\u2019re trying to do is stimulate  clean air, fuel efficiency, alternative  fuels. This strikes us down. This  is  going back to the old smokestack, fill  the air full of dirty air. This goes back  to all the traditional people that just  don\u2019t like the fact that there\u2019s competition out there and that the Federal  Government has to purchase that competition. I don\u2019t understand why in a  competitive world, where fuel and efficiency and engine development, where  we\u2019re going to have to lead that or  have our clock cleaned, this is exactly  what creates markets for that.

            "36": "H4316  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE June 16, 2011  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman  for that information on the schedule  for the coming week.  I want the gentleman to know that  on our side we are very pleased to see  the patent reform legislation brought  to the floor. As you know, that\u2019s a part  of our Make it in America agenda. I  know it\u2019s a part of your agenda as well.  I think this  is something on which  there obviously has been some controversy with respect to provisions of  the bill, but it is absolutely essential  that we give certainty to patents and  to accelerate the approval of patents.  The backlog that exists is not acceptable. I am pleased that this legislation  has come to the floor. Very frankly,  this is a needed and welcome piece of  jobs legislation.  One of the concerns we have on this  side of the aisle, as you know, is that  we have not from our perspective had a  jobs focus in the last 6 months. We welcome this part of our Make it in America agenda and part of your agenda as  well. Again, I think we can cooperate  in this effort, hopefully, and have a bipartisan effort on this patent reform  bill.  b1410  I also would raise the issue, Mr. Majority Leader, I want to say that I  know that you and Mr. KYLand others  have been participating in the talks  with Vice President BIDEN. There have  been constructive talks, I understand  from your comments and  the comments of Mr. VANHOLLENand Mr. CLYBURNon our side. We are very hopeful  that these talks will prove fruitful and  that we can move ahead. We believe  it\u2019s critical, as you know, and as you  have articulated, that we address the  default prevention responsibility that  we share. Clearly, America wants to  pay its bills, the American public expects us to pay our bill, and the international community expects us to pay  our bills. You and I have both read  quotes  from Mr. Bernanke, business  leaders  like Jamie Diamond, economists and others who have indicated  that  failure to assure that America  does not default on its bills will have  very dire consequences both here and  around the world.  So I am hopeful, Mr. Leader, that, although you did not announce it, we  have very little time left, as you know,  before the August 2nd date which Secretary Geithner has indicated is the  date on which we will no longer have  the cash flow ability to meet our obligations as they become due and to fund  the programs that we have authorized  and provided for the executive department to carry out.  I would very much be interested in  your thoughts with reference to how  we ensure that we take action in a  timely fashion. I was very pleased to  see Speaker BOEHNER\u2019s comment about  a week and a half ago that he was focused on assuring that we did not default and provide for the payment of  our debts prior  to  the end of  this  month. As you know, we have 4 days  left, or 31\u20442days left, in this month, and  that\u2019s next week, because the following  week we\u2019re off. I would very much be  interested in your observations on how  you see us going forward on this critically important issue.  I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.  Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  I also  thank  the gentleman for his remarks in couching his  observation or characterization of the  agenda having been brought forth by  our side over the last several months,  because we believe strongly that the  focus should be on jobs. We differ, I believe, with the gentleman and his side  of the aisle that a growth agenda is not  necessarily a government program, and  so our agenda, our jobs agenda, is focused on trying to eliminate the environment which is full of burdensome  regulations,  unfair  taxes,  and  new  mandates on the real job engines of  this country, which are, Mr. Speaker,  the small businesses and entrepreneurs  of this country.  If the gentleman would look to see  what we have been doing over the last  several months, he would see that our  agenda  is  very  focused  on  accomplishing that end.  We passed H. Res. 72. It was a resolution directing our committees to take  inventory and review existing, pending  and proposed regulations and orders  from agencies of the government with  respect to their impact on jobs. Those  reports are due June 30. They will be  focused on the kinds of things that we  could be doing to remove the impediments that government here in Washington has created for small business  growth.  We also brought forth H.R. 872, the  Reducing  Regulatory  Burdens  Act,  dealing with a duplicative application  of regulations on the pesticide industry, and, as the gentleman knows, that  bill had a lot of bipartisan support.  We also brought  forward H.R. 910,  which was the Energy Tax Prevention  Act. Mr. Speaker, I think there is probably very little dissent among small  businesses  in  this country  that  the  EPA has stepped entirely beyond its  bounds and has provided gross impediments to the growth of manufacturing  and small business  in this country.  That bill was squarely aimed at trying  to force the EPA to stop in its conduct  of attempting to accomplish what the  prior majority tried to do under its  cap-and-tax agenda.  Mr. Speaker, I would further say, we  brought H.J. Res. 37 to the floor. This  was a resolution of disapproval regarding the FCC\u2019s regulation of the Internet and broadband industry practices,  otherwise called the bill to stop its attempt  to control  the  Internet. The  ability for the government to begin to  impose its will on the Internet is a job-  killer. That bill was also taken up by  the majority.  We also, as the gentleman knows,  passed H.R. 4, the Small Business Paperwork Mandate Elimination Act. He  and his side joined us in the bill, which  began to repeal the job-killing nature  of the health care bill. It was otherwise  known as the 1099 provision, which all  small businesses said placed too much  paperwork burden on them.  We also have been very focused on  what people are most focused on when  they begin to think about the summertime and taking a vacation, which is  the gas prices and the prices at the  pump, and we have brought  forward  H.R. 1230, H.R. 1229, and H.R. 1231, all of  which were aimed at trying to lower  the cost of  fuel  in this country, to  maximize energy production  in  this  country, so not only could  families  have the ability to do what they need  but  also  that  businesses  could  see  lower energy costs.  And all of this, Mr. Speaker, takes  place in the context where we\u2019ve got a  government that is borrowing 40 cents  of every dollar it spends. We believe  strongly that not only do we need to  focus first on growth but we\u2019ve got to  finally do what Washington has failed  over the decades, which is to get its fiscal act  in order, to ensure that we  don\u2019t allow spending to get out of control again.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman asked  about the Biden talks. I share his commitment, as he related, that this is an  important  issue, that no one thinks  that America shouldn\u2019t pay its bills.  But I would also add, Mr. Speaker, that  the people who elected us expect us to  ensure that the fiscal insanity that has  been taking place in this town stop and  that we put in place reforms so we can  demonstrate that we\u2019ve changed the  system. That\u2019s the spirit in which our  side has engaged in the talks with the  Vice President.  As the gentleman knows, I have been  very public in my praise of the Vice  President in his conduct of these talks.  I am hopeful that we can meet or exceed the expectations right now, which  is  to  say we are aiming  to  reduce  spending by the trillions in order for us  to engage in the kind of vote-taking  that needs to take place to stave off a  default.  But I say to the gentleman, first and  foremost, our side will not support any  attempt to raise the debt ceiling that  is not accompanied by the kind of cuts  necessary and reforms necessary, nor  will we support an attempt to raise the  debt limit that raises people\u2019s taxes.  That, we don\u2019t want to do.  So, again, I am cautiously optimistic  that we are moving forward so as to  come to some agreement that meets  those guidelines.  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman  for his comments.  I would  respectfully note  that  so  much of what he talked about was resolutions. I think resolutions clearly do  state an opinion. Whether or not they  have any ultimate effect is to be seen.  I think the American public, in looking at the agenda the gentleman has  just gone through, probably says to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:22 Jun 17, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K16JN7.105 H16JNPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 2 K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",

We need to  be sure of that.  I know the President made the mistake one day of saying he had visited  all 57 States. I\u2019m well aware that there  are not 57 States in this country, although there are 57 members of OIC,  the Islamic states in the world. Perhaps there was some confusion as to  whether he\u2019d been to all 57 Islamic  states as opposed to all 50 U.S. States.  Nonetheless, we have an obligation to  the 50 American States, not to the 57  Muslim Islamic states.  Our oath that we took  is  in this  body\u2014in this House\u2014and  it\u2019s to the  people of America. It\u2019s not to the Muslim Brotherhood, who may very well  take over Egypt.  Once they do, they\u2019ll be bent upon  setting  up  a  caliphate  around  the  world, including in the United States,  and this administration will have been  complicit in helping people who want  to destroy our country out of the ignorance to think, if you help your enemies, they\u2019re going to like you better.  Not only do they not like you, as I  said, they disrespect you when they see  how foolhardy you are.  It\u2019s time to quit involving this country in warfare around the world unless  we can be sure that such warfare helps  us keep our oath to the United States  of America.

Under the previous order, there  will be 4 hours of debate equally divided and controlled between the two  leaders or their designees on amendment No. 476, offered by the Senator  from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, and  amendment No. 411, offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN.  Mr. REID. Mr. President,  noting  there is no one on the floor, I suggest  the absence of a quorum, and I ask  unanimous  consent  that during  the  quorum the time be equally divided.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.  The clerk will call the roll.  The  legislative clerk proceeded  call the roll.  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President,  I  ask unanimous consent the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President,  I  rise in support of the Ethanol Subsidy  and Tariff Repeal Act, which Senator  COBURNand I are offering as an amendment to pending legislation. The other  cosponsors on this amendment are Senator WEBBand Senator COLLINS. This is  identical to a bill that we have submitted. On that bill there are more cosponsors. They are COBURN, CARDIN,  to  WEBB, CORKER, LIEBERMAN, COLLINS,  SHAHEEN, BURR, RISCH, and TOOMEY.  I want to have the record straight  that this amendment is in response to  a bill which we have crafted. On Tuesday the Senate voted on the proposal  but unfortunately we saw a process  battle, which I spoke to on the floor,  which I think overwhelmed, in some respects, the debate. That is not the case  today. There are ongoing negotiations  to see if it is possible to put together a  solution which can bring all sides together on this amendment that we will  be voting on at 2 o\u2019clock. Thus far we  do not have an agreement. However, at  least one of our cosponsors of this has  said to me\u2014this is Senator WEBB\u2014that  he would  very much  appreciate  a  straight up-or-down vote on Coburn-  Feinstein so we know exactly where  the Senate stands. It is still possible,  even after that cloture vote, if we can  reach a successful conclusion to the negotiation that we could have another  vote and change that.  Today, this is the first vote that the  Senate has taken based on the merits  of repealing the ethanol subsidy and  tariff. In a nutshell, let me give the  reasons. I know of no other product in  the United States that has a triple  crown of benefits: It is a mandate: oil  companies must  buy  this  ethanol;  there is a subsidy: oil companies are  paid for buying this substance; and this  substance known as corn ethanol  is  protected by a protective tariff which  prevents other nations, such as Brazil,  from importing ethanol which actually  has more beneficial environmental effects.  KLOBUCHAR As a matter of fact, corn ethanol is  the  least environmentally proficient  form of ethanol. Everything else is better than corn; cellulosic is better, algae  is better, and sugar is better. The bottom line is we have a triple crown of  subsidy, mandate, and protective tariff  on the least effective, least environmentally sound ethanol there is.  More  importantly, corn ethanol  is  now used to such an extent that it is  having a major impact on food commodity prices and in particular on feed  prices. This is particularly true in the  poultry industry. I will get to that in a  few minutes.  I  do  want  to  thank  Senators  and THUNE for good-faith  efforts to try to reach a compromise.  As part of this compromise, at least  from my point of view, a substantial  amount of the revenue must be used to  reduce the debt and deficit in addition  to eliminating wasteful ethanol subsidies and tariffs. These negotiations  have been ongoing since Tuesday. We  have not yet reached an agreement.  The vote at 2 o\u2019clock will not end these  talks. I am perfectly willing to continue to talk but I do think it is important that we have a clean up-or-down  vote on the Coburn-Feinstein amendment.  The issue at hand is a simple issue.  The subsidy given to these oil companies costs taxpayers billions of dollars  every year and the tariff actually has  the effect of making us more dependent  on foreign oil. Let me explain. In 2005,  the ethanol subsidy cost taxpayers $1.5  billion. This year that number is nearly $6 billion. In just 6 years it has gone  from a cost of $1.5 billion to a cost of  nearly $6 billion. There is a reason for  it, and I will get to that in a moment,  but since 2005, the total cost of this  subsidy has been $22.6 billion.  Here is the increase every year: $1.5  billion in 2005; 2006, $2.6 billion; 2007,  $3.3 billion; 2008, $4.4 billion; 2009, $5.2  billion; 2010, $5.7 billion; and the all-  time high in these last 2 years of $5.7  billion.  However,  it continues to rise. The  proposal that has been made for an extension to 2015, by some, would cost another $31 billion.  Let me be  clear. The  subsidy  is  wasteful and duplicative. It does very  little to promote the use of ethanol  which oil companies already must use  under current law. The renewable fuels  standard dictates oil companies use 14  billion gallons of biofuels this year, 20.5  billion gallons by 2015, to 36 billion gallons by 2022.  These  volumes,  by  law,  increase  every year. It more than doubles by  2022. It is that doubling in volume that  will ultimately cost us; we are currently paying oil companies to follow  this law.  Let me speak briefly about the tariff.  The 54-cent-per-gallon tariff on ethanol  imports makes our Nation more dependent on foreign oil. The tariff acts  as a trade barrier, placing clean sugarcane ethanol imports from friendly nations at a competitive disadvantage to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:53 Feb 24, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\S16JN1.REC S16JN1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",
            "60": "S3860  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE June 16, 2011  they don\u2019t want  to put  in blender  pumps with no flex-fuel cars out there,  and the automobile manufacturers say  they don\u2019t want to build flex-fuel cars  because there are no blender pumps.  I might point out that in Brazil almost every car built by Ford, by GM,  by Honda, or Toyota\u2014those built  in  Brazil\u2014are basically built for flexible  fuel. They will burn anything from 10  to 20 to 50 to 85 percent\u2014actually, in  Brazil, up to 100 percent\u2014of ethanol.  That is the direction we need to go  here.  With these two amendments today,  we find ourselves going in exactly the  wrong direction. The Feinstein-Coburn  amendment tells the ethanol industry  that it no longer has the support of  Congress.  The McCain  amendment  would block one of the most critical  things we need to do; that is, the installation of flexible-fuel pumps.  I have said many times that we can  reform our biofuels policy. I am more  than willing to give up the ethanol tax  credit. I have said that before on the  Senate floor. We can give up the ethanol tax credit if the ethanol industry  has access to the market. But when we  take  the  two amendments  together,  one pulls the rug out from underneath  the ethanol industry in terms of its tax  credits\u2014and  I am  saying: OK,  fine.  That is fine. We can do that, if we have  access. Then the McCain amendment  comes along and says: No, no, you can\u2019t  use any of the funds we have put in the  last Ag bill\u2014which had tremendous bipartisan  support,  I might  add\u2014for  blender pumps at fuel stations.  So here we have it. Tell the ethanol  industry it can\u2019t get the tax credits,  and guess what. We are going to keep  them from getting access to the marketplace. That is what we need\u2014market access for ethanol. You can go to  Exxon and Mobile and Shell and all  those gas stations. Do you think they  want to put in an ethanol pump? They  are OK with 10 percent\u2014they will do  the 10 percent now\u2014but we need them  to put in those blender pumps, and the  automobile companies need to produce  cars that are flexible fueled. They do a  few of them now, but every car built  ought to be flexible fuel so people can  choose.  As I have said, ethanol can stand on  its own two feet now, if people have the  right and the freedom and the ability  to use it. But if we are up against monopolistic kinds of filling stations that  won\u2019t permit a blender pump to be put  in, then ethanol has no marketplace.  We also need to build a dedicated  pipeline for ethanol. The oil companies  and the gas companies have their own  pipelines. They would not put any ethanol through those pipelines. They say  it is due to water and all that, but let\u2019s  face it. They won\u2019t put any ethanol  through their pipelines. The private  sector can build\u2014not the government  but the private sector\u2014and is willing  and ready to build a dedicated pipeline  from the Midwest to the east coast. A  couple of companies have already secured most of the rights-of-way and are  ready to go. All they need is one simple  thing: a loan guarantee. They do not  need money, just a simple loan guarantee so they know they can build the  pipeline and that the ethanol industry  can use it and get the fuel to the east  coast, where the majority of our population is right now and where we don\u2019t  have enough ethanol in our major population centers.  So, again, we need to redouble our  national commitment to expanding the  use of renewable energy and weaning  ourselves off of imported oil. But we  are not going to do it with these two  amendments today. The ethanol industry just wants the marketplace to be  able to accept it, and they will stand  on their own two feet. They can do  that. That is more important than the  tax subsidies.  I might also add, I remember debating this issue with the then-Senator  from Texas, Mr. Gramm. We had a lot  of debates on the Senate floor back in  the 1980s or 1990s, I guess, on this issue.  I pointed out at that time that if you  talk about the tax credits and support  from the government the ethanol industry has gotten, it pales in comparison to the dozens of years of tax writeoffs and benefits we have given the oil  companies in America going clear back  to about 1920.  If you think about all the tax benefits we have given the oil companies in  America to drill, to produce, to ship, to  pipe, to refine, to market, and add it  all up, ethanol is just a small part of  that. But the oil companies have never  given up. They have never given up on  their  assault  on  ethanol  and  on  biofuels.  The Coburn amendment  is precipitous. At the end of the year, the ethanol tax credits are going to expire.  Hopefully, before the end of the year,  we will reach some agreement, work  out something where we have more access to the marketplace, and then we  can do away with the tax credits. But  we  should not  take an action  that  would slash the value of the ethanol industry\u2019s primary product by nearly 20  percent overnight.  Think about it this way. We have a 1-  year extension of the ethanol tax credits that goes to the end of this year. We  did that. The Congress did that. We  said that to the  industry.  Investors  have come in, modifications in plants  have  been made,  plants have  been  built. Yet in the middle of the year we  are going to say no? We are going to  take it away?  To all my  friends over there who  keep talking about the private sector  and how we need the private sector and  don\u2019t need the government, you are  going to pull the rug out from underneath the private sector on a guarantee  that we gave them earlier this year. No  industry could survive a shock such as  that, and it is wrong. It is wrong to do  that at this point in time.  We all know one thing. This afternoon, people can come down and vote  against ethanol, vote against the tax  credits for the ethanol industry, vote  to cut off marketplace access to ethanol, but nothing is going to happen.  The House will blue-slip it, and then we  will be on to doing what needs to be  done in a logical way; that is, to reduce  the tax credits for ethanol, which I am  in favor of doing. In fact, we then can  promote market access.  Senator LUGAR and I, in the past,  have worked on bills together, basically like the bill introduced this year,  that would do three things: It would  mandate a certain proportion of blender pumps be installed at the large gasoline stations, those that are owned by  the major oil companies. It would provide tax credits to the small mom-and-  pop stations that would put  in the  blender pump in their station, the independents. Third, it would mandate a  gradual  increase over  the next  few  years of the number of cars produced in  America and sold in America that are  flexible  fueled.  If we  do  all  those  things, ethanol will stand on its own  two feet.  I wished to say one last thing before  I yield the floor to the Senator and  that is this. Right now, much is made  of the fact that there is $5 billion of tax  credits this year going to the ethanol  industry. I understand that. However,  because of the lower price of ethanol,  because we are blending 10 percent ethanol into gasoline, all the people in  America today are paying less for their  gasoline than they otherwise would if  we didn\u2019t have ethanol. So if you take  that into account, the fact that the  consumers of America, when they fill  their gas tank, are paying less than  they would if they didn\u2019t have ethanol,  that more than offsets the $5 billion we  have put into the tax credits for ethanol support.  So, yes, we have supported the ethanol industry with $5 billion. I dare  say, we have gotten back probably  twice as much as that in savings at the  gas pump for the consumers of America.  Perhaps that is what the oil companies are mad about. Maybe they would  like to have that money  for themselves. I suppose that is probably true.  I understand that. But I think our obligation is to the consumers of America  and to the private sector, which is operating on a guarantee we gave them  that we would have these tax credits at  least until the end of this year, and I  think on an implicit guarantee that we  gave that we would make sure there  would be a marketplace that would be  open and accessible for biofuels.  So that is what we need to do, to reduce the tax credits but open the marketplace for the ethanol with blender  pumps and with  flexible  fueled cars.  But that is not before us today. But we  will continue to work together again  toward the end of this year to make a  reasonable, smooth transition from the  tax credits to access to the marketplace, and I will take the floor again  and again during the remainder of this  year on these issues.

So  corn-based  ethanol,  20 percent  cleaner burning than traditional gasoline;  cellulosic  ethanol,  60  percent  cleaner burning than gasoline. That is  according to the Environmental Protection Agency, which does not take a  particularly  favorable view of  these  fuels because they like to include in  their calculation  types of elements,  such as indirect land use in other countries around the world, which, frankly,  we do not think ought to be part of the  calculation, but even with that 20-percent cleaner burning than traditional  gasoline for corn-based ethanol and 60  percent for cellulosic ethanol.  I wish to read, if I might, from a letter that I received from an organization called ACORE. That is the American Council on Renewable Energy.  This organization  is about 500 deep,  represents about 500 other organizations; in some cases, American companies, universities, members  such as  Walmart, such as DuPont. This is what  they say:  Current domestic ethanol production  is  also laying the groundwork and infrastructure for the more advanced biofuels of the future including cellulosic ethanol, algae-derived fuels, and drop-in fuels. We have already crossed the threshold of these homegrown biofuels meeting a substantial portion  of transportation fuel demand for cars and  light duty trucks; but they cannot be further  developed without the infrastructure investments that are fostered by current ethanol  production today.  They go on to say that:  The Thune-Klobuchar amendment ensures  ethanol production will continue, while directing limited government resources to support  infrastructure  development  and  the  transition to advanced biofuels.  The ethanol tax credit has been critical to  increased domestic ethanol production and  corresponding  economic  growth,  job  creation, enhanced energy security and lower  gas prices. We urge you to oppose the Coburn  amendment, which would prematurely terminate support for our domestic ethanol industry while failing to invest in critical infrastructure and advanced biofuels. We ask  for your support of the Thune-Klobuchar  amendment.  The Thune-Klobuchar amendment\u2014  we are working with the Senator from  California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, the Senator  from Oklahoma, Mr. COBURN, on a solution that would hopefully lead us to a  result. It would do what many of the  folks in this Chamber want to see done.  It would do away completely with the  blenders credit, effective July 1, and  with the ethanol tariff. It would also  put money back into debt reduction.  We think that is a better way to do  this. I hope those discussions will lead  somewhere. But  this vote  today  is  going to be a largely symbolic vote for  reasons I just mentioned: It is unconstitutional. It will be blue-slipped in  the House  of Representatives  and,  therefore, it makes absolutely no sense  for us to be having this vote in the first  place. It certainly does not make any  sense for us to be sending a message to  this industry that we want to do away  with it.  I understand my time has expired.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President,  I  rise to speak in favor of the Feinstein  amendment. I am a proud cosponsor of  this proposal because it will save us  money, reduce food prices and do so in  a responsible manner.  Ethanol enjoys truly unprecedented  support from the Federal Government.  First there is the renewable fuels mandate that requires ethanol to be blended into gasoline.  Second, there is a 45-cent-per-gallon  subsidy to blend ethanol into gasoline  that is costing the Treasury nearly $6  billion per year.  Third, there  is a 54-cent-per-gallon  tariff on imported ethanol protecting  the domestic industry from any serious  competition.  And to top it all off the Federal Government spends billions every year to  subsidize the growth of corn for ethanol.  In a time of fiscal constraint we simply cannot afford to prop up an industry with such enormous supports.  And these supports are not just costing taxpayers money, but they are also  causing food prices to rise and harming  our environment.  The USDA estimates that 40 percent  of this year\u2019s corn crop will be used for  ethanol. This  is raising grain prices  worldwide,  especially  hurting  the  needy.  For  these  reasons,  the Feinstein  amendment has the support of taxpayer rights groups, religious groups  looking  out  for  the needy,  budget  hawks  concerned about  our deficit,  livestock growers who use grain as  feed, the grocers and restaurants who  are seeing food prices increase, and the  environmental community who understand that corn ethanol requires enormous amounts of fossil fuels to be produced.  My support for the Feinstein amendment is not just because it is the right  thing to do for our country and our  Federal budget, but because it is the  right thing to do for my home State.  New Jersey has over 120,000 flex fuel vehicles, but does not have a single E85  ethanol  pump  in  the  entire State.  120,000 cars that are built to allow  automakers  to  game  fuel  economy  standards but may never see a drop of  E85 fuel.  I know that this issue is important to  our friends in the Midwest, but ethanol  producers already have a guaranteed  market for their product as a result of  the Federal mandate. Now we have an  opportunity to help families across the  country by ending this failed ethanol  policy and providing  relief both  in  terms of their taxes and their  food  prices.  For these reasons, I will be voting in  favor of the Feinstein Amendment and  urge my colleagues to do the same.  I also think this vote is important  for the larger debate over the deficit.  Our friends on the other side of the  aisle have said revenues cannot be a  part of the strategy to reduce the deficit. I think this vote and the one earlier this week in which 34 Republicans  voted to end these wasteful ethanol tax  breaks show there is bipartisan support  for cutting wasteful tax subsidies and  loopholes and that these revenue expenditures must be part of any solution  on the deficit.  As I speak about that, let me end on  another item I think should be on the  table, one I have been promoting. The  first place to start in terms of tax expenditures is oil subsidies.  A bipartisan majority of 52 Senators  voted recently to end these tax breaks.  If these 34 Republicans come into the  fold, we could work together to make  some real progress. Oil companies do  not need these subsidies\u2014I am talking  about the big five\u2014with oil trading at  nearly $100 per barrel. They have all  the incentive they need in the marketplace. But cutting these subsidies, we  can cut the deficit by $21 billion. This  year alone these companies are projected to earn up to $144 billion in profits\u2014not proceeds but profits. If they  can simply live with a mere $142 billion  in profits, then they can do their share  to reduce the deficit without raising  gas prices.  It is time to come together across  party lines and to end wasteful tax subsidies and lower the deficit. This vote  is an important first step, and I think  by doing so we will\u2014notwithstanding  the issues about blue slips and constitutional impediments\u2014send a clear  sense of the Senate that will move us  in a direction that will end the ultimate subsidies and help us reduce the  deficit. I think ending oil subsidies will  get us on a path to a bipartisan solution that is critical for the Nation.  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President,  I rise  today in support of Senator MCCAIN\u2019s  amendment to prohibit the use of Federal funds for the construction of ethanol blender pumps and ethanol storage facilities. My vote today is not a  vote against ethanol as a transportation  fuel.  I  strongly  support  the  greater use of alternative  transportation fuels and alternative-fuel filling  stations in the United States. In certain cases, I have even advocated for  government support of these goals. But  government support for a source of energy should create a temporary boost,  not a long-term Federal dependency. It  is just as foolish to attempt to build an  economy on subsidized energy as it is  to build a house on the sand.  I have been criticized for opposing a  Democratic proposal to raise taxes on  domestic oil producer, but there is a  difference in the size of the Grand Canyon between allowing oil companies to  keep a portion of their own profits,  which they use for more domestic energy production, versus handing out  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:53 Feb 24, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\S16JN1.REC S16JN1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",

It is time  we spend it in this country for our people. We are not going to walk away  from our responsibility. We are still  going  to have  the  counterterrorism  going on. We are still going to protect  our personnel who are there. We are  still going to work for peace and reconciliation.  But you want to talk about the ways  to cure this deficit, it is not that hard.  We did it before, we can do it again.  The Democrats balanced  the budget  under Bill Clinton\u2014the only time it  was done in recent history\u2014and we created 23 million jobs, not by threatening  Medicare and Social Security, and the  Department  of Education,  and  the  EPA, and the Clean Air Act, and all of  the things they are going after here,  but by doing the right thing by our  children and our grandchildren and  making the right investment, to become energy independent.  So for me, the argument of not being  able to do anything because of the deficit, something is wrong with that. You  have to cure the deficit problem and  make  the  investments  that make  sense. Here  is  an  investment  that  makes sense. For every dollar of EDA  investment, you get $7 in private sector investment. That is what we ought  to be doing.  I said this before, I will say it again:  For every one job we create, it costs us  approximately $3,000 per job. These are  good jobs. It is a smart program for us.  That is why it has lasted since the  1960s. I said before, up to 200,000 jobs a  year could be created here, 1 million  jobs over the life of this bill. What are  we doing loading down a beautiful bill  such as this with all of these extraneous amendments?  We will look at a couple more charts.  If you want to know how many jobs  were created between 2005 and 2010,  450,000 jobs, and 85,000 jobs were saved.  So we are not talking about some ethereal idea of a new jobs bill. This is a  jobs bill that has worked, and it is a  jobs bill that should not be  filibustered.  It  should not  be  stalled.  It  should not be loaded up with things  that have nothing to do with it while  the American people worry and give us  an 18-percent approval rating. I am surprised it is that high at the rate we are  going.

DEAR BOXER:  SENATOR I am writing to  share with you the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Business Civic Leadership Center  (BCLC)\u2019s positive experience in working with  the Economic Development Administration  (EDA). BCLC has worked with EDA on numerous projects over the past ten years to  help local communities with their economic  development,  regional  sustainability,  and  disaster recovery initiatives. EDA has served  as a valuable partner in many communities  that BCLC has worked  in  including: San  Jose, CA, Seattle, WA, Cedar Rapids, IA, Mobile, AL, New Orleans, LA, Atlanta, GA,  Boca Raton, FL, Minneapolis, MN, Newark,  NJ and many others.  We have worked with EDA on projects including:  Conducting regional  forums designed to  bring corporate contributions professionals  together with economic development experts  and civic sector innovators to discuss how  businesses\u2019 corporate citizenship practices  can advance the competitiveness and long-  term development of their communities.  Providing opportunities to build up relationships between and among companies and  government agencies at the local and national levels.  Developing a report that maps how and  why companies invest in communities across  the United States.  Writing a report on economic recovery and  rebuilding in Cedar Rapids after the flooding  in 2008.  Sending economic development teams to  cities across the Gulf Coast to provide valuable oil spill recovery resources and information.  Working with local chambers of commerce  in disaster affected areas regions to provide  local recovery grants.  BCLC is the corporate citizenship arm of  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and in this  capacity we work with thousands of businesses and local chambers of commerce on  community development and disaster recovery issues across the country. These local  chambers and businesses are consistently  looking for national best practices, lessons  learned, technical assistance, planning and  strategy support, and other insights, tools,  and techniques to make their communities  as economically competitive as possible.  In our experience, EDA staff members have  displayed a high degree of professionalism  and technical expertise. They have engaged  with us on multiple levels, from consultations at the national level, to sharing valuable field experience at the state and local  levels.  We have canvassed many businesses and  local chambers about their community development needs, and they almost unanimously tell us that some of their highest  local priorities include business recruitment  and retention, and helping small and medium-sized businesses grow. They also tell us  that support for regional economic development planning  that transcends municipal  boundaries is an increasing area of interest,  and that this is a unique capability that  EDA can and does support.  As you consider EDA\u2019s future roles and responsibilities, we would be happy to share  with you our experiences and lessons learned  in working with the agency, and to provide  you with additional  quest.  Sincerely,  STEPHENJORDAN,  Executive Director,  Business Civic Leadership Center.  Mrs. BOXER. It is a letter from an  arm of the Chamber of Commerce. I  will tell you, it is rare when you get  the AFL\u2013CIO and an arm of the Chamber of Commerce  singing  from  the  same book. They do not want to see  filibusters. They want to see jobs. They  do not want to see filibusters. They  want to see progress. They want to see  us work across party lines.  So I kept asking during my remarks,  why would they do this to us? Why  would they do this to the American  people? I have an answer. I wish this  were not true, but it has been stated by  some of the Republican Presidential  candidates and it has been stated by  the Republican leader here: Their priority is defeating Barack Obama. Their  priority  is  defeating  our President.  Their priority is not job creation, it is  not business creation, it is not fair tax  policy, it is defeating this President.  When you look as it through that lens,  then  you  say  to  yourself, wait  a  minute.  If we  got  something  done  around here and the President had a  signing ceremony\u2014as we used to do in  the good old days when we worked together\u2014and he had a Republican here,  a Democrat here, and an Independent  there, and we all came together as we  always have\u2014unanimous consent. We  passed this in 2004 by unanimous consent. They are afraid if we did that, the  President would take out his pen and  he would sign this bill and we would  create jobs. I hate to say it, but I am  not making it up. That is what they  have said. I hope over this weekend  when we go home and we meet with our  people, and they say, Senators, you  have got to do something about jobs, I  hope the public will say to us, be we  Democrats or Republicans: Do not filibuster jobs bills. We cannot afford to  lose more jobs. We need to create jobs.  The EDA bill is a jobs bill. It was created as a jobs bill. It has been a jobs  bill since 1965, signed by Presidents,  passed by Congress, never loaded down  with amendment after amendment that  is not germane, that weighs it down. I  hope the people at home will pay attention to this.  I will say this: There is a pattern.  This is not the first bill. I told you  about the small business bill, same  thing; FAA bill, sitting over there, no  conferees;  patent  bill,  sitting  over  there, no action. And millions of jobs  are at stake.  I just found this out about the small  business bill that they killed here a few  weeks ago. Each year that bill provides  support for 6,000 businesses, and over  the lifetime of the program it has provided almost 26,000 awards to firms in  California to help them get started.  That bill was filibustered to death. I do  not get it, except if what I say is true  and that is what the motivation is, and  l a e n b j VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:53 Feb 24, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\S16JN1.REC S16JN1         ",

Without  objection, it is so ordered.  f  CYBERSECURITY  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I  rise today to speak about a serious  issue that touches on our national security, our economic well-being, the  safety of our families, and our privacy;  that is, America\u2019s cybersecurity.  I look forward to conducting an in-  depth examination of the aspects of  this issue that falls within the Senate  Judiciary  Committee\u2019s  jurisdiction  during the Subcommittee on Crime and  Terrorism\u2019s June 21, 2011, hearing, \u2018\u2018Cybersecurity: Evaluating the Administration\u2019s Proposals.\u2019\u2019 However, because  of the importance of improving our cybersecurity, as demonstrated by the recent Gmail spear-fishing attacks and  hacks at Sony, Epsilon, Lockheed Martin, and even the Senate itself, I rise to  make some initial remarks today.  American  technological  innovation  ushered in the Internet age, bringing  with it Facebook, YouTube, and the  rest of the World Wide Web. It set off  an explosion of new commerce, freedom  of  expression,  and  economic  opportunity even in the smallest details of  our lives\u2014allowing a car company, for  instance, to unlock your car doors remotely if you have locked yourself out  of your car.  However, this increased connectivity  allows criminals, terrorists, and hostile  nations to exploit cyberspace, to attack America, to invade our privacy, to  loot our intellectual property, and to  expose America\u2019s core critical  infrastructure to cyber sabotage. Entire online  communities  are  dedicated  to  stealing and selling American credit  card numbers. Consider the disturbing  fact that the price of your credit card  number stolen online actually goes up  if the criminal also  is selling your  mother\u2019s maiden name. Some criminals have learned how to spy on Americans, hacking into our home computers  and  looking out  through  the video  camera attached to the screen. Others  run Web sites selling stolen entertainment without paying  the American  companies that created  it. And millions of American computers\u2014millions  of American  computers\u2014have  been  compromised by malware  slaved  to  botnets  that can  record your every  keystroke and send it instantaneously  across the world to a criminal\u2019s laptop.  I firmly believe that cyber crime has  put our country on the losing end of  the largest illicit transfer of wealth in  world history. Whether  by  copying  source code, by industrial espionage of  military product designs, by identity  theft, by online piracy, or by outright  old-fashioned stealing from banks\u2014just  doing  it  the  electronic way\u2014cyber  crime cripples American  innovation,  kills  jobs here at home, and undermines our economic and national security.  Congress must act to protect Americans from these Internet dangers and  to protect our civil liberties. Let me  say at the outset that the government  must not be allowed to snoop indiscriminately into our online activity, to  read our e-mail, or to watch us online.  There simply is no need for such an invasion of privacy, and we must move  forward with that firmly in mind.  The majority leader has introduced a  leadership bill that will be a vehicle for  our work. The Commerce Committee,  led  by Chairman ROCKEFELLER and  Ranking Member SNOWE, both of whom  I had the privilege to serve with on the  Intelligence Committee, and the Homeland Security Committee, led by Chairman LIEBERMANand Ranking Member  COLLINS, reported key bills last year.  Chairman LEAHY and  the Judiciary  Committee have  reported  important  legislation on data breach and other  issues central  to cybersecurity. The  Armed Services, Energy,  and  other  committees  have  studied  the  issue  from the perspective of their particular  jurisdictions and expertise, and under  the leadership of Chairman FEINSTEIN,  the Intelligence Committee Cybersecurity Task Force completed its classified report last July, authored by me,  Senator MIKULSKI, and Senator SNOWE.  So we have been ready in Congress.  The administration has now weighed  in with its own proposal, recognizing  that we need cybersecurity legislation  to make our Nation safer and launching in earnest our legislative process.  We have hard work ahead to find the  best possible solutions to this complex  and grave challenge to our national  and economic security. As we begin, I  would like to flag five issues that I believe must be addressed as this legislation goes forward.  First, we need to build greater public  awareness  of  cybersecurity  threats  going forward.  What is the problem? The problem is  that information affecting the dot.gov  and the dot.mil domains\u2014the government  domains\u2014is  largely  classified.  And  in  the  dot.com,  dot.net,  and  dot.org domains, threat information is  often kept proprietary by the victim  business  so as not  to worry  shareholders, customers, and regulators, or  give ammunition to competitors. The  result is that Americans are left in the  dark about the level of danger that is  actually out there on the Internet.  The administration\u2019s proposal would  require covered businesses  to notify  customers if their personal information  is stolen, expand reporting of cybersecurity threats, and require some public  assessments of cyber readiness.  I believe more can still be done on  these fronts. I have had the pleasure of  working with Senator KYLto introduce  S.  931,  the Cyber Security Public  Awareness Act. I would like to urge interested colleagues to review  it and  consider  including  it as part of our  larger cybersecurity legislation. That  is first.  Second, the Senate needs to ensure  that we give private industry the tools  necessary for self-defense against cyber  attacks.  Proper sharing among and within industries of cybersecurity threat information  is vital. The administration  took an  important  step  by  recommending, subject to various safeguards,  enhanced  sharing  of  cybersecurity  threat information by the government  with private industry. But we may also  need to remove legal impediments that  unnecessarily  limit  the  sharing  of  threat information within industries,  and we should be prepared to listen  here to the private sector\u2019s needs as  they set up those areas for safe communications about the cyber threats  they share.  Third, our Nation does not have basic  rules of the road for end users, ISPs,  and software and hardware suppliers.  The administration proposal includes  important provisions that would move  us  in the right direction. Assuming  that ISPs\u2014Verizon and Comcast and  the companies that are actually providing  the  service\u2014assuming  that  these companies qualify as critical infrastructure, which is an assumption  we should clarify before getting too far  down this path, the administration\u2019s  proposal would require them to develop  a standardized framework to address  cybersecurity.  Sensible laws and regulations have  made our highways safe, and we need  similarly  to make  our  information  highways  safe. Federal procurement  can encourage effective cybersecurity  standards  with  appropriate  supply  chain security so as to improve cybersecurity across the hardware and software  industries. These  improvements  will benefit the government directly,  but it will also improve the security of  all products on which business and consumers rely.

            "108": "E1116  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014Extensions of Remarks June 16, 2011  meals. On average, nationwide, we are talking  about just 57 dollars per month for nearly 10  million mothers and infants who cannot afford  nutritious  foods. Almost one-half of  the children born in our country rely on WIC. Many of  these enter the Medicaid program, and experience has shown that the nutritional benefit to  pregnant women  results  in up  to $4.20  in  Medicaid savings for each dollar spent through  WIC. Restoring full funding for this program is  the smart thing to do for our budget, just as  it is the right thing to do for our citizens.  Women and infants are not the only vulnerable population put at greater risk of food insecurity by this bill. The 22 percent cut to the  Commodity Supplemental Food Program will  prevent at  least 130,000  low-income seniors  from receiving desperately needed food packages. The 23 percent reduction to the Emergency Food Assistance Program will  leave  empty shelves at our local food banks, pantries, faith-based organizations, soup kitchens,  and shelters. With  food prices continuing  to  rise  sharply  and Americans  continuing  to  struggle  to get ahead  in a  tough economy,  now is not the time to remove the critical safety net provided by these food assistance programs. In addition, food aid for 1.1 million people around the world will be unavailable as a  result of the $476 million cut to the Food for  Peace international humanitarian program and  the McGovern-Dole program, which provides  for the donation of U.S. agriculture goods to  school feeding initiatives around the world.  Furthermore,  the drastic  reduction  to  the  Commodity  Futures  Trading  Commission  budget will leave the U.S. economy and consumers in peril. The Commission will not have  the  resources necessary  to prevent  the big  banks  from making  the kinds of speculative  bets that led to the recent financial crisis. And  as gas prices continue to strain household and  small business budgets, this bill will do nothing  to help  the Commission go after excessive  speculation  in oil markets\u2014even  though  recent data suggest  that nearly 90 percent of  those  trading  in  the oil markets are speculators, not legitimate users of oil. These speculators are driving up the price of petroleum  and gasoline, and without an effective CFTC  with adequate  funding, consumers and  taxpayers are the losers.  This bill also includes severe funding cuts  for  the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and  Inspection  Service and  the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, which will undermine food safety in  America and weaken efforts  to ensure  that  medical products and new drugs are safe and  accessible.  It underfunds research programs  to improve food production, safety, and quality  as well as initiatives designed to advance organic  farming and  related markets. And  it  eliminates almost one billion dollars  in conservation programs to protect soil and farmland, maintain  healthy  agriculture  in  rural  America, preserve key resources, and restore  wildlife habitat  that supports associated recreational and economic opportunities.  Mr. Speaker, the Agriculture Appropriations  bill before us today is one more step in the  wrong direction  for  the Nation\u2019s budget, our  economy, and our people. It leaves vulnerable  low-income women, infants, children, and seniors to fend for themselves even though we  know that good nutrition improves health and  saves money in the long run. It allows Wall  Street  speculation  to  continue  unchecked,  threatening our economy and driving up gas  prices. It says that we should ignore the needs  of our faith- and community-based food service organizations as well as those of hungry  children and impoverished people around the  world. And it leaves us all at greater risk of  encountering  food-borne  illnesses, sets back  research programs, and ignores our conservation needs. The American people expect more  of their government, and I urge my colleagues  to oppose this deeply flawed bill.  f  HONORING ALISON SCHIEBER  HON. SAM GRAVES  OFMISSOURI  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 2011  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker,  I  proudly pause to recognize Alison Schieber of  Saint Joseph, Missouri. Alison is active in the  community and she has been chosen to receive the YWCA Women of Excellence Award  for Woman in Volunteerism.  As President of the Allied Arts Council, Alison is also serving on the Missouri Citizens for  the Arts Board to advocate for the advancement of  the arts  through education. A Sustainer of the Junior League of St. Joseph, Alison is also a member of the Community Action Committee and a spokesman for the St.  Joseph Public Library Modern Library Campaign.  Alison is lauded for her ability to lead by example, understanding  the  important role  the  arts play in childhood development. Her advocacy for the arts led to her work with the Missouri Citizen\u2019s for the Arts as a lobbyist, working to remove the sunset clause on the Cultural Entertainment tax.  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in  recognizing Alison Schieber. She has made  an amazing impact on countless individuals in  the St. Joseph Community. I am honored to  represent her in the United States Congress.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. JARED POLIS  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 2011  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I was not present  for votes on Friday, June 3, 2011. Had I been  present,  I would have voted  \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 on rollcall  vote 411.  f  RIDE TO WORK DAY  HON. JOHN J. DUNCAN, JR.  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 2011  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker,  as a Member of the Congressional Motorcycle  Safety Caucus  I  rise  to  recognize Ride  to  Work Day.  Each year the third Monday in June is designated as Ride to Work Day and this year, on  June 20, more  than a million motorcyclists  across the Nation will use their motorcycles to  commute. In doing so, these riders will make  a statement about  the utility,  fuel economy  and fun of using motorcycles and scooters for  transportation.  The Motorcycle Industry Council\u2019s most recent information estimates that more than 21.5  million Americans operated a motorcycle  in  2009. Many of these riders visited Tennessee,  and specifically the 2nd Congressional District,  which features some of motorcycle riders\u2019 favorite roads in the Country. Two members of  my own staff ride motorcycles for both fun and  transportation.  As more  and more Americans  choose  scooters and motorcycles as  transportation  options, or just choose to ride for recreation,  it becomes ever more imperative that each of  us does all we can  to promote motorcycle  safety. This means  that motorcyclists must  ride  responsibly, by getting  trained and  licensed and obeying traffic safety laws. Other  road users can do their part by being aware  of motorcyclists and sharing the road.  On June 20, I encourage all riders to gear  up and ride to work. I also encourage all other  road users to take special note of all the riders  on the road and remember to always look out  for motorcyclists.  f  HONORING MURIEL REDMOND  HON. SAM GRAVES  OFMISSOURI  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 2011  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker,  I  proudly pause to recognize Muriel Redmond  of Saint Joseph, Missouri. Muriel is active in  the community and has been chosen  to receive the YWCA Women of Excellence Lifetime Achievement Award: Woman  in Volunteerism.  After her marriage, Muriel became active in  St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital Guild, continuing her interest founded while a student nurse. With her  dedicated  involvement, she accepted  leadership  positions,  including  president. Muriel  started  the Candy Striper program  in 1947,  being the first instructor.  Muriel\u2019s lifelong interest in the medical field  included membership in the Medical Auxiliary.  She has been an active member in the Flower  Society, Girl and Boy Scouting, and P.E.O.  She  is a member of Y Women and a supporter of the Abuse Shelter.  As a member of St. Joseph\u2019s Cathedral  Church and  the adjoining school, she supported her children\u2019s education with two periods as president in the PTA. She remains active in the Quarter of A Century Nurses and at  her present residence, the Living Community  of St. Joseph; she was a founder of the Needles and Pins group.  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in  recognizing Muriel Redmond. She has made  an amazing impact on countless individuals in  the St. Joseph Community. I am honored to  represent her in the United States Congress.  f  MARKING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY  OF THE DISCOVERY OF AIDS  HON. NITA M.

SCOTT RIGELL  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 2011  Mr. RIGELL. Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  commend Paul Shoemaker and  the Virginia  Beach Elks Lodge #2268.

HOWARD COBLE  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 2011  Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker,  unlike  other  sports, baseball is unique because there is no  clock. Unless weather  intervenes,  the game  ends only when the leading team records 27  outs. The baseball team at Randleman High  School, located in the Sixth District of North  Carolina, discovered that getting the last out  can be  the most difficult of all. Randleman  won the North Carolina High School Athletic  Association State 2\u2013A championship on Saturday, June 4, 2011, in dramatic fashion by collecting that final out with a play at the plate.  The Randleman Tigers won this state championship with an 8\u20137 victory over defending  state champion East Rutherford High School.  The game was played on Doak Field at North  Carolina State University. The Tigers won the  best of three series, two games to one. This  was Randleman\u2019s first appearance in the finals  since 1985 and marks an important achievement in the school\u2019s history.  In the last inning, a six-run lead dissolved to  two. Another hit scored  the seventh run  for  East Rutherford, but as  the  tying  run was  heading to the plate, Randleman\u2019s Tyler Walls  launched a perfect throw to cut-off man Dylan  Richardson.  The  Tiger\u2019s  shortstop  never  paused as he whipped  the relay  to catcher  Zach Bach  to get  the  last out and give  Randleman  its  first  state  title ever. Head  Coach Van Hurley, Jr., told the Asheboro Courier Tribune,  \u2018\u2018To win  like  that, Curtis  [Linthicum] to throw like that. It\u2019s all unbelievable.  We had three outs to get and six runs to give.  I had complete confidence that he was going  to do it.\u2019\u2019  With a grand slam on Friday and pitching  the gutty win on Saturday, Curtis Linthicum received  the MVP award. Joining him on  the  state championship team were Will Albertson,  Easton Welch, Ted Luna, Jacob Tally, Dexter  Allen, Jeremy Taylor, Dylan Richardson, Ryan  Vickers, Cody Trogdon, Tyler Walls, Connor  Pratt and Zach Bach. The winning team was  led by Head Coach Van Hurley, Jr., who was  ably assisted by coaches Shawn Barker, Clayton Welch and Scott Clemons.  The Tigers finished their extraordinary season with a record of 28\u20134 and the satisfaction  that comes  from experiencing  the  result of  practice and hard work right up until that final  out. On behalf of the citizens of the Sixth District of North Carolina, we congratulate  the  Randleman High School baseball  team  for  winning the 2011 state title.  f  IN SUPPORT OF EXPANDING THE  PRIMARY  CARE  WORKFORCE  AND OPPOSING H.R. 1216  HON. KATHY CASTOR  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 2011  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to acknowledge the importance of the  primary care workforce and support provisions  included in the Affordable Care Act to expand  the number of primary care physicians, especially in my home state of Florida.  One of  the smartest  things we can do  in  health care  today  is  to bolster primary care  and family medicine. Your primary care doctor  is your family doctor; the one you and your  family see for checkups, and the doctor who  is most likely to understand your health care  needs. It is widely understood that if we are  going to be more efficient in America with our  health care dollars, we need to focus on prevention and boost the number of primary care  doctors. There is a great demand for primary  care physicians across the country and training new doctors in a community teaching setting is vital.  Training doctors  is an especially  critical  issue in my home state of Florida. We have a  significant doctor shortage. Florida has great  medical schools and are  turning out quality  medical  school graduates, but  that  is not  enough because we do not have a sufficient  number of  residency slots. Florida  is short  nearly 3,000 new GME positions to meet current physician demand. Florida  is  the  third  most populous state, but ranks 44th in the nation in terms of the number of residency positions under Medicare. Those numbers reflect a  brewing crisis situation. Not only does Florida  have the largest and fastest growing percentage of citizens over 65, we have a rapidly  aging  physician  population\u201425  percent  of  Florida\u2019s physicians are over 65. We need to  do everything possible  to  train new primary  care doctors all across the country, but especially in Florida. H.R. 1216 will take us backwards and that is why I strongly oppose its  passage.  Before we take up legislation to terminate  an  initiative  that encourages  the  training of  new doctors in primary care, family medicine  and internal medicine, please understand our  country\u2019s need for physicians who are most effective for our families. I urge my colleagues  to support a robust primary care workforce.  We need to work together to develop modern  methods to train primary care physicians\u2014and  the Teaching Health Centers GME program,  which my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle seek to eliminate, is an innovative new  model to help train more primary care physicians and encourage them to practice in communities. Physicians who train in a community  setting have a better understanding of  the  needs of  the communities  they serve. Many  organizations\u2014like MedPAC and the Council  on Graduate Medical Education\u2014have called  for a community-based GME program, so why  do Republicans want to eliminate these opportunities before they start? Residency rotation  through rural and outpatient locations provide  great training opportunities for physician residents; and it encourages the resident to practice in out-patient or rural communities.  If we do not work together to find common  sense solutions  for our primary care workforce, America will be short of the doctors we  need  to serve  in our communities and our  families and neighbors will suffer  the consequences. This is why I voted against H.R.  1216 and why I strongly oppose any attempt  to eliminate innovated methods for training our  future primary care workforce.  f  HONORING FIREFIGHTER SCOTT  DAVIS  HON. MIKE PENCE  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 2011  Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker,  today  I rise  to  honor the service and sacrifice of one of Indiana\u2019s bravest.  Firefighter Scott Davis was tragically killed  yesterday while fighting a fire at Tabernacle of  Praise Church in Muncie, Indiana. He is the  first Muncie firefighter to give his life in the line  of duty since 1955.  Those who knew Firefighter Davis were not  surprised at his boldness and bravery in the  Tabernacle of Praise  fire. He was a  former  Yorktown  fire chief, and had been with  the  Muncie Fire Department since June 15, 2005.  He bravely sacrificed his life protecting the  community, and in so doing, he will forever be  remembered as a hero and servant leader.  In the midst of great tragedy, I honor Firefighter Davis and  the other brave men and  women who risk their lives every day to protect  their community. We must always be  grateful for those who run in when others run  out.  Firefighter Davis was a man of faith, a devoted husband to his wife Raeanne, and loving father of three children\u2014Jake, Emma, and  Max. My family and I offer our deepest condolences and prayers to his loved ones, and we  honor  the  legacy of Firefighter Davis\u2019  life of  sacrificial service.  The Good Book tells us that \u2018\u2018The Lord is  close to the brokenhearted.\u2019\u2019 And that is my  prayer  for  the Davis  family and  the Muncie  community.

It  means climate-smart crop production, livestock rearing, fish farming and forest maintenance practices that enable all people to  have year-round access to the nutrition they  need.\u2019\u2019  Kanayo F. Nwanze, president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development  (IFAD), stressed that building resilience in  farming and herding communities required a  long-term commitment.  \u2018\u2018But time\u2014as we  can see from the devastating situation in the  Horn of Africa\u2014is running out,\u2019\u2019 he told delegates at the meeting in Rome.  The challenge of seeking to avoid future  food insecurity crises in the Horn of Africa is  daunting. Conflict has severely hampered development and relief efforts in Somalia, and  affects the mobility of pastoralists and their  livestock, which is key to food security in  the region.  But disaster risk reduction is increasingly  seen as a humanitarian imperative, crucial  to battling poverty and achieving sustainable development.  \u2018\u2018Building  resilience  of  farming  and  herding communities in East Africa requires  a long-term, sustained commitment on the  part of the region\u2019s governments and the  international donor community,\u2019\u2019 said Kevin  Cleaver, IFAD\u2019s associate vice-president.  \u2018\u2018The rains will fail. But let us not fail,  too.\u2019\u2019  f  KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE PRESS  CONFERENCE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. POE) for 5 minutes.  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, time  is up. It is time for the administration  to quit stalling and make a decision on  the Keystone XL pipeline project, the  pipeline that comes from our friends in  Canada from Alberta all the way down  to my congressional district in southeast Texas, to the refineries in Port Arthur, Texas.  The House has done its job this week  by passing a bill to move this decision  along. Now it\u2019s the Senate\u2019s turn to  pass this bill so that the administration finally makes a decision on the  Keystone XL project that will create  thousands of American  jobs and decrease our dependence on unfriendly  nations for energy.  I commend my friend from Nebraska  (Mr. TERRY) for passing this legislation  and being the spearhead of this legislation.  All that has to happen is the State  Department has to make a decision and  the administration has to support that  decision one way or the other. It\u2019s been  3 years for the administration to make  a decision, yes or no, on the XL pipeline. It\u2019s time to fish or cut bait. Pick  a horse and ride it. The administration  must make a decision.  And this should be, to me, an easy  choice for this administration. Either  they can force Americans to continue  to rely on unfriendly foreign countries  for our energy, like Venezuela and the  Middle Eastern dictators, by depriving  Americans of a reliable source of oil at  a time when gas prices are around $4,  or they can work with our friends in  the north to supply over 1.4 million  barrels of oil per day.  Pipelines are the proven and safe, efficient source of energy. Best of all,  this project creates thousands of jobs  at a time when unemployment in this  country is 9.2 percent. And it is climbing. I would think this job-creating,  shovel-ready project\u2014which my liberal  friends always talk about\u2014would be  something they would support and the  administration would support.  As the administration continues to  stonewall our own domestic production, we must safely and immediately  look for ways to meet energy needs.  The country needs energy. It needs  jobs. This project provides both. What\u2019s  the holdup, Mr. President?  For every barrel of oil  shipped a  thousand miles, less than one teaspoon  of liquid is lost from a pipeline. Transporting goods by pipeline has the lowest carbon footprint as compared with  other transportation modes. Crude oil  has to get to America some way. It either comes by barge or truck or rail or  marine, and pipelines historically are  the safest way to transport crude oil.  Attacking  a  pipeline  on  environmental grounds seems to be absurd to  me. Pipelines have been the most cost-  effective and environmentally  sound  way to transport oil and natural gas. A  medium-sized pipeline, which is about  150,000 barrels a day, requires operating  more than 750 trucks or a 75-car train  every  day  to  transport  the  same  amount of crude oil.  Transporting oil through a pipeline is  far safer than using transportation by  oil tankers. When an oil tanker has a  major oil spill, millions of barrels of oil  can be spilled in a matter of a few minutes, a few hours, or just a few days.  Nearly half a million miles of natural  gas and crude oil pipelines are in the  United States\u2014500,000 miles of pipeline. Over half of these are in the State  of Texas alone\u2014270,000 miles of pipeline. And about one-third of all of the  Nation\u2019s pipelines,  I understand, go  through  the  energy  capital  of  the  world, my district in southeast Texas.  If we don\u2019t use the crude oil from  Canada in this pipeline, the Canadians  could very easily, instead of having a  north-to-south pipeline, have a pipeline  east-to-west and pipe it to the west  coast, and then ship it to our good buddies, the Chinese, who want to buy it.  You know, America\u2019s energy plan  seems to be twofold: send money to  Brazil and let the Brazilians drill off  their coast, and we\u2019ll buy their crude  oil; and the second part is, make sure  we use those cute little curly CFL light  bulbs. And that\u2019s it.  It\u2019s time that we take care of ourselves. This is a good project for America, American jobs, and a way to get  crude oil into the United States. It\u2019s  time for the White House to make a decision.  And that\u2019s just the way it is.  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair.  f  DEBT CRISIS  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) for 5 minutes.  Mr. DEFAZIO. With one simple vote  last December, Congress precipitated  the so-called debt crisis. We voted to  extend all of the Bush tax cuts at a  cost of $4 trillion over 10 years. I voted  \u2018\u2018no.\u2019\u2019  So now, the debate comes down to  what\u2019s more important to the American people\u2014Social Security or  tax  cuts; Medicare or tax cuts; jobs or tax  cuts. That\u2019s what this debate  is all  about right now\u2014preserving tax cuts,  particularly tax cuts for the wealthy  and the largest multinational corporations in this country.  Some are still trying to drag Social  Security into this debate. Social Security did not cause one penny of this  debt. In fact, Social Security is the  largest owner of Federal debt in the  world. They\u2019re the largest investor in  Federal debt. Social Security did not  cause this problem. Yes,  long term,  starting in 2037, Social Security is projected to only be able to pay 73 to 75  percent of benefits. We can solve that  simply. Ask all Americans to pay the  same percent of their income into Social Security.  Today, if you earn over $106,800, you  pay a lower percentage of your income  into Social Security. Lift that cap. You  could lower the tax for everybody. All  those who  earn  less  than  $106,800,  they\u2019d get a little tax cut. Everybody  who earns more than $106,800 would pay  the same percent of their income in  taxes as those who earn less. That\u2019s  fair. It solves Social Security\u2019s problems forever.  Then there are others who say well,  it\u2019s Medicare. Medicare  is the thing  we\u2019ve got to kill. The Ryan plan, the  Republican plan: kill Medicare. Turn it  into a voucher program. That\u2019s their  solution there. Future seniors would  have a subsidy to go to a government-  sponsored  exchange  to  buy  private  health  insurance,  and  the  voucher  would be  far  less  than  the cost of  health insurance. We don\u2019t need to kill  Medicare to save it or to preserve the  tax cuts.  Medicare, we could do away with the  Bush-Republican unpaid-for  prescription-drug benefit that subsidizes the  pharmaceutical and  insurance  industries and instead say Medicare, we\u2019ll  negotiate lower drug prices for all people on that program and give them an  at-cost benefit. That saves $20 billion a  year.  We could reform the way we buy durable medical equipment and save another $20 billion a year. And then we  could move on to paying doctors for  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:49 Jul 29, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A28JY7.002 H28JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",

It would mean higher interest rates on  cars, on home loans, on credit cards, on  student  loans.  It would mean  fewer  jobs and less growth.  Instability, uncertainty,  creates  a  downdraft on the recovery. Congress  should be focusing on economic recovery and creating jobs if we want to  close  that deficit gap. You balance  budgets by full employment economies.  We surpassed the debt  limit over 2  months ago, and come August 2, the  Treasury will simply not be able to pay  all the bills that are currently due.  Yes, it\u2019s long overdue to reach a compromise. Instead, Speaker BOEHNERhas  walked  away  from  the  negotiating  table and has chosen to roll out a hasty  bill that hasn\u2019t gone through the normal  committee process. Apparently,  many in his own party reject it. This  isn\u2019t leadership for America at a time  when she needs it. It may be capitulation to Grover Norquist and his lobby,  but our responsibility is far greater.  Mr. Speaker, the way that you balance budgets is to put people to work  and grow the economy. I support a balanced, bipartisan solution to reduce  our deficit, create jobs and grow our  economy, to expand our middle class  and protect Medicare, Social Security  and Medicaid beneficiaries. The solution to deficits is robust job growth  and full economic recovery. Let\u2019s spend  two months putting that initiative forward!  f  THE AMERICAN DEBT LIMIT HELD  HOSTAGE\u2014AN  UNNECESSARY  CRISIS  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. OLVER) for 5 minutes.  Mr. OLVER. Mr. Speaker, today we  face an unnecessary crisis. The debt  limit has never before been held hostage by any political party, because it  is in every American\u2019s best interest to  protect the credit of the United States;  but now ideologues in Congress have  hijacked this issue, and have pushed  our Nation to the brink of default in  rejecting all offers of compromise.  Calls for massive spending cuts, and  spending cuts alone, without raising  any revenues whatsoever are irresponsible at least and deliberately destructive at worst. They would default on  our debt, causing a global financial crisis, rather than see hedge fund managers, corporate  jet owners or phenomenally profitable oil companies pay  higher taxes. Their call for fiscal responsibility rings hollow, and the fiscal  history of the last three decades shows  that.  This  chart  shows  the  growth  America\u2019s national debt since 1980.  At the end of the Carter administration, the national debt was less than $1  trillion. Twelve years later, with President Reagan\u2019s 8 years and the  first  President Bush\u2019s 4 years, the national  debt had grown by more than 300 perof  cent\u2014it had quadrupled\u2014and we were  mired in debt. The Reagan-Bush economic policies greatly  increased the  debt and led to soaring deficits and rising interest rates. It ended in a recession.  In 1993, President Clinton was under  severe pressure from the very Republicans who had meekly  followed the  two Republican Presidents  as  they  raised the national debt by over 300  percent. President Clinton championed  a balanced austerity program with,  roughly, equal spending cuts and revenue increases\u2014the Clinton years. Republicans in both the House and Senate  voted unanimously against that program, arguing it would cost jobs and  cause a recession, but the exact opposite occurred. More than 20 million jobs  were created under the Clinton administration, and each of the last three  budgets of the Clinton Presidency produced a surplus. Those three budgets  were the only budgets and surplus in  the last 40 years, and Clinton\u2019s balanced program  is  considered highly  successful  by  economists. President  Clinton  raised  taxes  on  those who  could afford it and reduced spending to  shrink our deficit, and the economy  grew by leaps and bounds.  The fiscal record of the second President Bush is a record of utter irresponsibility.  It began with massive  tax  cuts,  skewed  sharply  toward  the  wealthy, and with trillions of dollars  spent on two long, unpopular wars\u2014all  of that paid for by borrowing. It ended  in the Great Recession, caused by the  collapse  of  an unregulated housing  market which was  fueled  by Wall  Street greed. President Bush turned  President Clinton\u2019s surplus into more  than 5 trillion additional dollars added  to our national debt\u2014all the way up to  here\u2014almost doubling the debt again.  President Obama was  inaugurated  during the worst month of job losses in  the Great Recession and cannot be  blamed for what happened before, but  the  recovery has  stalled, and we\u2019re  short 12 million jobs.  History has shown us what works and  what doesn\u2019t. The Reagan-Bush economics led to hugely increased debt.  The Clinton economics eliminated the  deficit  and  accelerated  economic  growth, but it required some sacrifice  by all Americans to fix the national  problem.  Now Republicans want to slash social  programs, gut Medicare and Social Security  benefits,  and  further  reduce  taxes for the wealthiest few. The Republicans threaten default on our debt.  The only plan they offer would add  hundreds of thousands of people to the  unemployment  lines  by  eliminating  jobs in the public sector. They would  protect the wealthiest few at the expense of the entire country. They offer  no plan to create jobs and no long-term  solution. Yet America needs a  long-  term solution, and that must include  spending  reduction and  revenue  increase in balanced proportion.  b1140  DEBT CEILING HOSTAGE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) for 5 minutes.  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker,  the elaborate Kabuki dance continues  here on Capitol Hill surrounding the  angst about increasing the debt ceiling.  I think what we are seeing can be summarized in three words: \u2018\u2018recklessness,\u2019\u2019  \u2018\u2018abuse,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018hypocrisy.\u2019\u2019  First of all, it is reckless for my Republican friends to hold the debt ceiling discussions hostage in an attempt  to achieve other political goals. There  have already been  significant costs.  American  currency  has  weakened.  We\u2019ve watched a slide of the stock market since last Friday when the agreement blew up as Speaker BOEHNER  walked away from his work with President Obama. We\u2019ve watched premiums  being paid now to ensure United States  debt. People are making adjustments  that are having  consequences  right  now and eroding the confidence that we  have had globally in the strength of  American  commitments  to  pay  its  debt\u2014a confidence that has resulted in  record  low-interest  rates  that have  benefited  everybody  in  the United  States, and that is at risk.  The irony is that there is no reason  for this to occur. We have increased the  debt ceiling 102 times since this unusual little law was enacted in 1917.  The United States, you recall, is one of  only two countries in the entire world  that goes through this charade of having to vote to finance spending that  we\u2019ve already done.  It has always been routine. We did  this routinely for President Bush. The  irony is now when we are facing another adjustment in the debt ceiling,  ironically most of the debt, $9.5 billion,  was incurred as a direct result of the  policies of the two Presidents Bush and  Ronald Reagan. There is a great little  chart on page A\u201314 in today\u2019s New York  Times that outlines this.  Instead of making  it  routine and  making whatever pontification people  will do on the floor of the House, which  they have done since 1917, now all of a  sudden we have  thrown  a monkey  wrench into the process. We\u2019ve raised  the specter of default. We\u2019re having  people  speculate  whether  there\u2019s  enough money to go to August 2 or August 5. We\u2019re speculating about what  debts, what bills the President will  pay.  The  irony  is that this Republican  recklessness  is actually  empowering  the President of the United States to  make decisions about whether to pay  Chinese creditors or honor our obligations to senior citizens or people who  do business with the United States.  Absolutely outrageous.  Wouldn\u2019t you think Congress would  like to make these decisions rather  than punting to the President? Well,  no. In fact, the Republicans are more  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:49 Jul 29, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K28JY7.023 H28JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",
            "20": "H5682  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE July 28, 2011  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.  Speaker,  since  our Republican  colleagues assumed the majority in January, we have swung from one artificially created crisis to the next.  In the spring, we barely dodged a  government shutdown. Now we face an  unprecedented and unnecessary crisis  over raising the debt ceiling, an event  that\u2019s occurred more  than  70  times  since 1964. And we\u2019re already hearing  rumblings of another potential shutdown in October at the end of the current fiscal year.  Mr. Speaker, the most baffling part  of this legislation is that it requires us  to have this debate all over again in 6  months.  Time and time again, I\u2019ve heard my  Republican colleagues say that private  capital has not found its way back into  the market because of economic uncertainty. Surely the majority cannot believe that going through this debate  again in 6 months would do anything to  increase market stability or reduce uncertainty.  Mr. Speaker, lurching from one politically motivated  calamity  to  the  next is doing our economy great harm.  It\u2019s doing our country great harm. We  need a bill that addresses the default  issue for the long term, not one that  will require us to repeat this madness  in a matter of weeks. It\u2019s past time for  the majority to bring such a bill to this  floor, so that we can focus on bringing  jobs back and building our economy for  the long haul.  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, at this  time I am happy to yield 3 minutes to  another hardworking member of the  Committee on Rules, my good friend  from  Spring  Hill,  Florida  (Mr.  NUGENT).  Mr. NUGENT. I thank the chairman  of the Rules Committee, the gentleman  from California,  for allowing me to  speak on this topic.  We have an obligation to ensure that  government doesn\u2019t default on its debts  for the first time in history. I\u2019ve always said that America is a country  that keeps her promises, and  those  promises include our debts. The Senate  hasn\u2019t  acted. The President  hasn\u2019t  acted. So today, the House is considering yet another  solution  to keep  these promises. I\u2019m not just talking  about promises to our creditors. If we  default, we break promises to our seniors, to our troops, and to our veterans.  Such a scenario, in my view, is just totally unacceptable.  b 1300  The Budget Control Act is a way forward. It\u2019s a down payment on serious  spending reforms. It\u2019s cuts now, and  it\u2019s more cuts in the future. Most importantly, it requires both chambers of  Congress to vote on a balanced budget  amendment to the Constitution.  Future cuts and future spending caps  are all well and good, but they don\u2019t  hold our feet to the fire. We all know,  if the Federal Government wants to  spend money, they will do it. They\u2019ve  proven that time and time again. The  Budget Control Act recognizes that we  can\u2019t keep  spending what we don\u2019t  have, which is why it requires Congress  to vote on a balanced budget amendment.  It\u2019s a new promise to the American  people\u2014a promise that we are going to  do better, a promise that we will only  spend what we collect.  President Obama says he wants a balanced approach. What we want, what  the American people want, is a balanced budget. The President has done  plenty of telling us what he won\u2019t do.  What President Obama hasn\u2019t told us is  what he will do. What President Obama  has are his speeches. Speeches aren\u2019t  plans.  A plan is what we have here in front  of us today. It\u2019s a good plan. Could it  be better? All of us on this side of the  aisle believe it could be. We passed a  resolution of Cut, Cap, and Balance,  but that died in the Senate. So, today,  we are talking about what is going to  move this country  forward, what  is  going to set us up on a path of sustainable  spending, not what we\u2019re  currently living with, which is an addiction. We have a spending addiction in  the United States.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I am very  happy to yield my friend from Spring  Hill an additional 30 seconds.  Mr. NUGENT. A plan is what we have  here in front of us today, and it\u2019s a new  way forward. I hope my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle recognize that  and move with us.  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MARKEY).  Mr. MARKEY. The Republican Party\u2019s deficit plan is very simple: one,  prolong the default crisis; two, push  the Nation to the very brink of economic collapse;  three,  repeat  it all  again and again until election day 2012.  The Republican Party  cares  only  about  political  victory. They  don\u2019t  want compromise. They want capitulation.  And if America goes into default, it  will be your fault.  We now have the pluperfect form of  the Republican Party\u2019s political paradox: Republicans hate government,  but they have to run for office in order  to make sure it doesn\u2019t work. In 1995  and  \u201996,  the Republican Party  shut  down the Federal Government. In 1997  and \u201998, the Republicans shut down the  Congress over  impeachment. Earlier  this year,  they  threatened  to  shut  down the Federal Government again  unless they got an extension of tax  cuts for the very rich.  And now Republicans are trying to  shut down the entire economy. Republicans are turning Americans into the  laughingstock of the world.  If our Nation defaults, it will devastate Americans all across the country.  If you have an adjustable rate  mortgage, you will pay more. If you  have a credit card, you will pay more.  If you have a small business, you will  pay more.  This Republican default will impose  a Tea Party tax on the entire country.  It will force Americans to pay billions  more of their hard-earned money when  they can least afford it. The Tea Party  has congressional Republicans wrapped  around  its  little  finger, but  it\u2019s the  American people who are going to get  squeezed.  The  Republican  Party  doesn\u2019t care. After all, it was the Bush  administration and congressional Republicans who put us on this course in  the first place.  The only way to end this historic  nightmare is to resolve another massive deficit\u2014the leadership deficit in  the Republican Party.  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume to  say to my very good friend from Massachusetts that, as I listen to those remarks, I am really struck by the fact  that our view is that we\u2019re in this together, and I will say for the record  that we care about absolutely everything that my friend said we don\u2019t care  about.  We as a Nation have a challenge that  needs to be addressed in a bipartisan  way. The measure that  is before us  today is one that was\u2014and I underscore the word \u2018\u2018was\u2019\u2019\u2014agreed to by the  Senate majority leader, HARRYREID,  and by the Speaker of the House of  Representatives, JOHNBOEHNER. Now, I  know that Senator REID is not at this  juncture supportive of this measure;  but it\u2019s important to note that we need  to bring about greater spending cuts.  I know that I speak for most all of  my Republican colleagues when I say  that this is really the beginning of a  process towards reducing the size and  scope and reach of government. We feel  passionately about the need to expand  individual  initiative and opportunity  in this country, and to characterize us  as doing nothing but wanting to close  down the government and being controlled by  some outside group, Mr.  Speaker, we as Republicans want to  work in a bipartisan way because we  recognize that Barack Obama  is the  President of the United States and that  the Democrats have control  in  the  United  States  Senate.  That\u2019s why  Speaker BOEHNER has worked  diligently in pursuing the goals and the  priorities that we have, but at the  same time, he has recognized that we  can\u2019t get it all.  No one is happy with this measure  that is before us. Speaker BOEHNER is  not happy with this measure that is before us, but he understands that we  have to ensure that we don\u2019t see the  Nation go over the brink and that we  do, in fact, increase the debt ceiling,  but his goal has been to get to the root  cause.  As we\u2019ve now found out, 75 times the  debt ceiling has been increased since  1962. In fact, I\u2019m told that former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, as  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:05 Jul 29, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K28JY7.039 H28JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",

            "44": "H5706  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE July 28, 2011  the genMr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I would  like to reclaim my time.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. MCGOVERN.  I yield  the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.  Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I\u2019m not  talking about the sequestrations. I\u2019m  talking about the fact that this commission\u2019s instructed to find $1.8 trillion  in cuts and Medicare and Social Security are not exempted from those cuts.  This is a roadmap, this is a users guide  as to how to cut Social Security and  Medicare. We reject it.  I yield to my friend.  b1600  Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for  yielding.  Let me say this is not a commission.  Members should not refer to this as a  commission, because the idea of a commission, some sort of outside entity,  we\u2019re talking about our colleagues in  the House and Senate who will be  members of  the Joint Select Committee who have a responsibility, as  colleagues, to report this back.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  LATOURETTE). The time of the gentleman from New Jersey has again expired.  Mr. MCGOVERN.  I yield  tleman 10 more seconds.  Mr. ANDREWS. The gentleman  is  correct. This is not a commission. It is  a committee that is empowered to cut  Medicare and Social Security. We will  not stand for it.  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 10 seconds to say to my friend  this is not a committee that is empowered to cut Social Security and Medicare. It is a committee, a joint select  committee, that is empowered, for the  first time, to submit to both Houses of  Congress  recommendations  that we  will have an up-or-down vote on.  With that, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield  2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from  Maryland (Ms. EDWARDS).  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition to the underlying bill. This  is nothing more  than political posturing by  the Republican majority.  And  I  think  it\u2019s  important  for  the  American people to understand that  this majority has asked us time and  time again to vote to end Medicare, to  cut Social Security, to cut Medicaid,  and they\u2019re doing  it once again. No  question about it. What\u2019s being offered  up by this majority is nothing short of  recklessness, absolutely nothing.  The Speaker  and  the Republican  Party know that the President and the  Senate are going to reject the bill. I  don\u2019t even know why we\u2019re here on this  floor, Mr. Speaker. Rather than spending the last several months developing  a real plan that would avoid default,  the Republicans have  spent months  stripping away health care protections,  attacking the EPA, jeopardizing jobs,  not creating  jobs. And here we are,  once again, ready to end Medicare, Social Security, cut away Medicaid benefits, and attack the most vulnerable in  our communities.  I have to say, Mr. Speaker,  if  it  weren\u2019t sad, it would be laughable. The  plan would require $2.7 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years,  cut $915 billion at the offset, and another $1.8 trillion in December. They\u2019re  coming after Americans\u2019 Social Security  checks.  They\u2019re  coming  after  Medicare. They\u2019re coming after Medicaid. That\u2019s what  this majority  is  doing. Let\u2019s not be fooled by it. It\u2019s  time for the American people to stand  up.  The bill threatens our ability to pay  our obligations. They\u2019re not interested  in paying our obligations. These are  debts that we\u2019ve already incurred. And  yet they won\u2019t take the money that  they\u2019ve given away to the wealthiest 2  percent of this country. No, they can\u2019t  give up theirs. The oil and gas companies can\u2019t give up theirs. The companies that have offshored jobs can\u2019t give  up theirs; but they\u2019re asking the American people to sacrifice Social Security, Medicare, education, Medicaid.  It\u2019s unfair, and we won\u2019t stand for it.  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 10 seconds to say to my very  good  friend  from Maryland, she has  just adequately, very accurately described the measure that has been proposed by the Senate majority leader,  HARRYREID.  With that, I am happy to yield 1  minute to my very good friend from  Lafayette, Louisiana (Mr. BOUSTANY), a  hardworking member of the Ways and  Means Committee.  Mr.  BOUSTANY. Mr.  Speaker,  I  think there was a gross distortion of  what\u2019s being proposed here. And again,  the previous speaker just condemned  the Senate Majority Leader HARRY  REID\u2019s bill in the U.S. Senate. That\u2019s  the only Democratic bill we\u2019ve had. So  it seems to me that there\u2019s a little bit  of a fight going on on the other side of  the aisle between their House Members  and the Senate.  To my friend from New Jersey, this  committee  that\u2019s  formed  is a committee of active sitting Members of the  House and Senate. So in order for anything to be recommended by this committee, it would require, in all likelihood, all of the Democrats to support  it.  Mr. ANDREWS. Will the gentleman  yield?  Mr. BOUSTANY. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.  Mr. ANDREWS.  If that committee  wanted to close tax loopholes, would  they need a simple majority or a two-  thirds vote of the House?  Mr. BOUSTANY. It would be a simple  majority.  Mr. ANDREWS. So it\u2019s your position  that a simple majority of both Houses  could raise taxes?  Mr. BOUSTANY. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s  what we need. We need that to force  some movement.  BOEHNER The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, at this  time it\u2019s my privilege to yield 2 minutes  to  the gentleman  from South  Carolina  (Mr. CLYBURN),  the distinguished assistant leader.  Mr. CLYBURN. I thank my friend for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, while the clock is ticking, the Republican majority is dickering and  the American people are  hurting. Our financial markets are on  pace for their worst week in nearly a  year. State governments are bracing  for downgrades in their borrowing capacities, and the gap between those in  our society who have a lot and those  who have very little is growing.  The Republican majority continues  their efforts to divert attention from  the self-inflicted crisis with manufactured controversies, holding the American economy hostage to their reckless  and  dispassionate  demands. As  the  clock ticks toward default and the pain  it would bring to middle-income families and those who aspire to become  middle income, my friends on the other  side continue to play politics. Speaker  does not even pretend that  this is a serious attempt to solve the  problem. He sold this bill to his conference by telling them that it wasn\u2019t  bipartisan. And with divided government, a plan that isn\u2019t bipartisan is no  plan at all. It\u2019s just a game.  The President and the Democrats in  Congress as well as the American people have  advocated  a  balanced  approach to reduce the deficit by growing  the economy and protecting the most  vulnerable,  including Medicare, Medicaid,  and  Social  Security  beneficiaries. We have been willing to make  tough,  politically  difficult  compromises.  This bill on the floor today, just like  the bill from last week, is yet another  partisan time-waster. Our constituents  are not interested in any of us voting  to cut Medicare or cap Social Security  or balancing the budget on the backs of  Medicaid recipients. A 6-month extension is another waste of time.  We must resolve this matter now and  ensure the full faith and credit of the  United States. Let\u2019s defeat the Boehner  bill.  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I would  like to inquire of my friend how many  speakers he has remaining.  Mr. MCGOVERN.  I  am  speaker.  Mr. DREIER. I would encourage my  friend to proceed, and then I will offer  some closing remarks.  Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield myself the  balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 31\u20444minutes.  Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this  bill does nothing to solve our  long-  term fiscal challenges because everybody here knows that this isn\u2019t going  anywhere.  Instead,  it\u2019s  a  political  stunt.

            "52": "H5714  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE July 28, 2011  With that, I yield 1 minute to a terrific member of the Budget Committee,  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN).  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  One of the issues we want on the  table here  is  revenue. The  top  400  wealthiest people in the United States  of America pay a 17 percent tax rate.  My constituents  in Youngstown and  Akron, Ohio, pay a heck of a lot more  than 17 percent.  b1710  We hear our friends on the other side  say how all of these changes need to  occur, how all of these problems need  to be solved. But heaven forbid, Mr.  Speaker, we ask  the  400 wealthiest  families in the United States of America to maybe be a little bit patriotic  and help us out. And you\u2019ll say, Well,  these are the job creators. These taxes  aren\u2019t going into place for another year  or two. We\u2019ve got to get through this  downturn.  But we need to send the message to  the bond market that we are serious.  And for us to be this irresponsible and  not ask the wealthiest\u2014what are they  being asked to sacrifice here? The top 1  percent, what are we asking them to  sacrifice?  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman.  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. One final point.  The debt that we now are debating  was run up by our friends on the other  side\u2014two wars, the Bush tax cuts, and  a prescription drug plan all on the  credit card. And now the same people  who\u2019ve worked their way up  in the  leadership positions are saying, We\u2019re  not going to pay the bill. This is irresponsible.  Let\u2019s solve this in a balanced way,  and let\u2019s ask for some shared sacrifice.  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself 2 minutes.  The gentleman, my friend over from  Maryland, keeps  talking  about  the  Reid plan, the Senate majority leader  over in the Senate. His plan. I\u2019ve got  the CBO score, too. It says it\u2019s a $2.7  trillion increase. That means it doesn\u2019t  raise the debt limit less than we cut  spending, so it cuts less. But more importantly, $1.3 trillion of that money is  accounting  tricks  and  budget  gimmicks.  Mr. Speaker, the American people  are tired of all of the accounting tricks  and the budget gimmicks that go on in  Washington. Let me explain what $1.3  trillion of this does. It says that imagine that we\u2019re at war for 10 years in Afghanistan and Iraq at surge levels. We  assume we\u2019re going to be fighting this  war for 10 more years with over 100,000  troops  in Afghanistan and, oh gosh,  wait. We\u2019re going  to withdraw our  troops in 2014. Trillion dollars in savings.  I\u2019ve got a better idea. Let\u2019s pass a  bill to cover the Moon with yogurt that  will cost $5 trillion today. And then  let\u2019s pass a bill the next day to cancel  that bill. We could save $5 trillion.  Wait. I got a better idea. Our debt is  $14 trillion. Let\u2019s come up with a new  plan to spend $14 trillion, then rescind  it the next day and let\u2019s save $14 trillion.  This stuff is fiscal fantasy. You can\u2019t  make this stuff up, Mr. Speaker. Suggesting that we\u2019re going to be in a war  at these levels for 10 more years when  everybody knows we\u2019ve already decided  not to do that, that does not get us $1.3  trillion in spending cuts. Only in Washington can you add up math like that.  We need real spending cuts.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield myself an additional minute to say this is  getting serious, Mr. Speaker, very serious. We can\u2019t keep spending money we  just don\u2019t have. Now 42 cents of every  dollar coming out of this place is borrowed money. It doesn\u2019t just threaten  our  children and grandchildren any  more. It is hurting our economy today.  Half of that money is coming from  other countries  like China. Why on  Earth do we want to give the President  a blank check to keep doing that, giving our sovereignty and our self-determination to other countries to lend us  money to fund our government. Those  days have got to end.  This bill doesn\u2019t cut as much as we  want. We passed a budget cut $6.2 trillion in real spending cuts. This cuts  about a trillion.  Let\u2019s cut  this  trillion, bank  that  money, and then go cut some more.  That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do to be responsible.  The problem in this town is not that  we don\u2019t tax Americans enough. The  problem  is we\u2019re  spending way  too  much money.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, of  course we should be reducing the deficit. Of course we should make sure  that we don\u2019t rely on the Chinese as  our bankers any more, which is why  it\u2019s so ironic that our Republican colleagues refuse to cut subsidies for oil  companies by one penny for the purpose of reducing the deficit so we don\u2019t  have to rely on borrowing from China  anymore.  In fact, if you look at Exxon\u2019s quarterly profits today, they\u2019re through the  roof. Now, I\u2019m all for having Exxon  make money. But why  should  they  have taxpayer money on top of it? And  yet our Republican colleagues get up  here and they talk about how we\u2019re dependent on China. But they don\u2019t want  to break that dependency if it means  actually asking the top oil companies  to get rid of their subsidies for the purpose of deficit reduction. So let\u2019s get  serious.  Now, with respect to the plan that  has been put forward by Senator REID.  I  listened to my colleague. I would  point out to the body that if you look  at the Republican budget and the documents that accompanied it when they  pointed out what their savings were  relative to the CBO baseline, they also  show a trillion dollars in savings from  the global war on terror. As my friend  the chairman knows, that is a function  of the way the Congressional Budget  Office scores.  But it is also a fact that when the  Republican budget was presented, they  presented it both relative to the President\u2019s baseline and the congressional  budget baseline. I would further make  the point that even if you took that off  the table, the proposal by Senator REID  cuts  immediately more on  spending  than the Republican proposal before us  today, the difference being he doesn\u2019t  keep  the economy hanging under a  cloud for 5 months and make this country go through this exercise just by the  end of December.  With that, I would yield 1 minute to  the distinguished Member of Congress  from Illinois (Mr. JACKSON).  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Soon my  colleagues will be quoting Dr. King\u2019s \u2018\u2018I  Have a Dream\u2019\u2019 speech, and here\u2019s a  quote they will not read and they will  ignore: \u2018\u2018In a sense, we\u2019ve come to our  Nation\u2019s Capital to cash a check. When  the architects of our Republic wrote  the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory  note to which every American was to  fall heir. This note was a promise that  all men, yes, black men as well as  white men, would be guaranteed the  \u2018unalienable rights\u2019 of \u2018life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness.\u2019  \u2018\u2018It  is obvious today that America  has defaulted on this promissory note  in so far as her citizens of color are  concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the  people a bad check, a check which has  come  back  marked  \u2018insufficient  funds.\u2019\u2019\u2019  But we refuse to believe that the  bank of justice is bankrupt. The problem, Mr. Chairman,  is not that we  spend. It\u2019s that we don\u2019t honor our obligations. We are a Nation that spends  billions of dollars to put a man on the  Moon,  fund the war  in Afghanistan,  fund the war in Iraq, but we can\u2019t find  the money in this Congress to put a  man on his own two feet right here in  America.  And there is something more fundamental, Mr. Speaker, that is going on  here. This President is being treated  differently than other Presidents. No  other President has been \u2018\u2018stook up,\u2019\u2019  shook down, or held hostage as this  President of the United States over  this debt vote. This is fundamentally  unfair, Mr. Speaker,  to change  the  rules in the middle of the game.  ANNOUNCEMENTBYTHESPEAKERPROTEMPORE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore.

Mr.  Speaker,  I  move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2244) to designate the facility  of the United States Postal Service located at 67 Castle Street in Geneva,  New York, as the  \u2018\u2018Corporal Steven  Blaine Riccione Post Office\u2019\u2019.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:  H.R. 2244  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION  1.  CORPORAL  STEVEN  RICCIONE POST OFFICE.  BLAINE  DESIGNATION.\u2014The  (a)  facility  of  the  United States Postal Service located at 67  Castle Street in Geneva, New York, shall be  known and designated as the \u2018\u2018Corporal Steven Blaine Riccione Post Office\u2019\u2019.  (b) REFERENCES.\u2014Any reference in a law,  map, regulation, document, paper, or other  record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to  be a  reference  to  the  \u2018\u2018Corporal Steven  Blaine Riccione Post Office\u2019\u2019.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. LANKFORD) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DAVIS) each  will control 20 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Oklahoma.  GENERALLEAVE  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. Speaker, I ask  unanimous consent that all Members  may have  5  legislative days within  which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material  on the bill under consideration.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there  objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma?  There was no objection.  Mr. LANKFORD. I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2244, introduced by  the gentleman  from New York  (Mr.  HANNA), would designate the facility of  the United States Postal Service located at 67 Castle Street in Geneva,  New York, as  the Corporal Steven  Blaine Riccione Post Office.  The bill is cosponsored by the entire  New York State delegation and was reported from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on June  22.  With that, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. HANNA).  Mr. HANNA. I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 2244, which designates a  post office in Geneva, New York, as the  Corporal Steven Blaine Riccione Post  Office.  I introduced this legislation to extend long overdue recognition to a national hero from the 24th Congressional  District.  Corporal Steven Riccione was a native of Geneva, New York. He was a Geneva High School graduate who volunteered to join the Army in 1967 during  the Vietnam War.  While on a search and destroy mission with his platoon in Vietnam, Corporal Riccione  came  under  intense  enemy fire and became pinned down.  Riccione, then a private, saw a machine gunner in his platoon get wounded. As Major General E.M. Strong described  in his October 1967 account:  \u2018\u2018Private Riccione, with complete disregard for his own safety, rushed from  his covered position through a vicious  hail of enemy fire to aid his wounded  comrade.  \u2018\u2018He continuously exposed himself to  the withering hail of enemy fire, standing up at times, to place effective fire  on enemy positions. When his weapon  was struck by an enemy bullet and was  demolished, he undauntedly picked up  a machine gun and charged an enemy  bunker, killing two enemy soldiers.  \u2018\u2018Shortly after, Private Riccione was  mortality wounded while helping  to  evacuate  wounded  personnel  under  heavy enemy fire.  \u2018\u2018Private Riccione\u2019s devotion to duty  and personal courage were in keeping  with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit  upon himself and the United States  Army.\u2019\u2019  Corporal Riccione was killed in action while helping to evacuate wounded  American soldiers.  As a result of Private Riccione\u2019s actions, Major  General  Strong  recommended him  for the Bronze Star  Medal with Valor Device,  and  the  Bronze Star Medal with First Oak Leaf  Cluster, which he was posthumously  awarded. He was also promoted to corporal.  Mr. Speaker, Corporal Riccione is a  source of great pride to his family, his  community  in Geneva, my congressional district, and indeed to a grateful  Nation.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation so that Corporal Riccione\u2019s  memory may be honored in his own  hometown of Geneva, New York, for  generations to come.  Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. I yield myself  such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the House  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform minority, I am pleased to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:06 Jul 29, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K28JY7.110 H28JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",

The amendment was ordered to be  engrossed and the bill to be read a  third time.  The bill (H.R. 2608), as amended, was  read the third time and passed.  f  ORDER OF PROCEDURE  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the period of morning business be extended until 5 p.m.,  with Senators permitted to speak for  up to 10 minutes each; further, that at  5 p.m. I be recognized.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.  f  RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY  LEADER  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is recognized.  f  DEBT CEILING  Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the  clock is ticking. In just a few days, the  U.S. Government will no longer have  the ability to borrow money to pay its  bills\u2014a situation the President and his  advisers  said would  trigger an economic Armageddon.  I was shocked last night when 53 Senate Democrats issued a letter saying  they intend to vote against the only  piece of legislation that has any chance  of preventing all this from happening.  Even more shocking is the fact that  Democratic leaders and the President  himself have endorsed every feature of  this legislation except one, and that is  the fact that it doesn\u2019t allow the President to avoid another national debate  about spending and debt until after the  next Presidential election. Every other  feature of the House bill was essentially agreed to earlier except for one\u2014  the President wants to avoid having  another discussion about deficit and  debt before the election. This assurance is the only thing the President  and Senate Democrats are holding out  for right now.  The Democrats can try to  justify  their opposition to the House bill any  way they want. They can claim they  are  worried  about  a  stalemate  6  months from now. They can ignore the  fact that of the 31 times Congress and  the President have  raised  the debt  limit over the past 25 years, 22 of those  debt limit increases lasted less than a  year. President Reagan, in 1984, signed  three bills in the course of his election  year that raised the debt ceiling. It was  not unusual. In fact, what is unusual is  to ask for $2.7 trillion in debt limit increase. That is unusual. That is unprecedented.  So what is worse, a default now or a  potential default 6 months down the  road? Because if those 53 Senate Democrats follow through on their threat to  filibuster the House bill, that is what  they will be doing\u2014ensuring default  now rather than working with us to  prevent it later. Why would you want  to do that? The answer is, to make the  President\u2019s reelection campaign a little bit easier.  It is inconceivable to me that the  President  would  actually  follow  through on this threat. After all, the  President\u2019s first responsibility is to do  what is best for the country, not his reelection campaign. The same goes for  our friends on the other side of the  aisle. It is inconceivable to me that  they would actually block the only bill  that would get through the House of  Representatives and prevent a default  right now. Inconceivable. It is inconceivable to me that they would do this  for no other reason than to help the  President avoid having another debate  before the election about the need for  Washington to get its fiscal house in  order. But that is precisely what we  may be headed for this weekend\u2014guaranteed default or a bill that takes the  specter of a default off the table, while  giving us another opportunity to address the very deficits and debts that  caused this crisis in the first place.  Senate Democrats are playing with  fire, and it is hard to conclude they are  doing it for any other reason than politics. So I urge our friends on the other  side  of  the  aisle  this morning  to  rethink their position and join Republicans in preventing default.  f  RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, leadership time is reserved.  f  MORNING BUSINESS  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the  Senate will be in a period of morning  business for 1 hour, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10  minutes each, with the time equally divided and controlled between the two  leaders or their designees, with the majority controlling the first half and the  Republicans controlling the final half.  Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I  suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The  legislative clerk proceeded  call the roll.  to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:53 Jul 28, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A28JY6.001 S28JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",

What that means is that  right now we have some 4,000 FAA  workers who are furloughed, and tens  of thousands of people out of work in  airport construction  jobs\u2014infrastructure. These are people who are not  working for the government; they are  working  for private contractors who  have a contract with FAA for runway  construction, putting in lights, safety  measures, things like that. So tens of  thousands of people are out of work in  the private sector because of the cutoff  of FAA reimbursements to these businesses around the country.  It is costing the Federal Government  about  $25 million  in  tax  revenue a  day\u2014$25 million a day in lost revenue.  That money would be plowed back into  the economy to pay for aviation operations and for the people who are working out  there on  construction  jobs  building  runways,  lighting  systems,  and things like that.  At a time when we have so many people who are unemployed in our country\u2014and the underemployment rate is  really somewhere between 16 and 18  percent\u2014with over 23 million people in  America out of work, what do the Republicans do? They hold up funding for  the Federal Aviation Administration,  which puts 4,000 more FAA people on  furlough and tens of thousands of people  working  on  construction  jobs  around the country out of work. Why  would the Republican Members of this  Congress do such a thing? Because they  want to overturn a National Mediation  Board decision that was handed down a  little over a year ago to align the election procedures under  the National  Railway Labor Act with the provisions  that have always been in place under  the National Labor Relations Act.  Let me explain that. Under the National Labor Relations Act, which has  been in existence since the late 1930s, if  you have an election to see whether  workers want to organize a union, you  count the yeas and you count the nays  of those who vote. If the yeas are more  than the nays, the workers  form a  union. If the nays are more than the  yeas, they don\u2019t form a union. Under  the Railway Labor Act, an odd thing  took place. Under that, it said that if  you have an election for a union, you  count the yeas, you count the nays,  and then all those people who didn\u2019t  vote, you put them in the \u2018\u2018nay\u2019\u2019 column. Interesting. If you don\u2019t vote, you  are an automatic no.  What the National Mediation Board  did a year ago was realign this using  rulemaking procedures. They said that  from now on you would only count the  yeas and the nays. You would not assign to one side or the other those who  didn\u2019t vote. To most of us, that just  seems  to make  plain  old  common  sense. After all, any election for your  local school board\u2014and we know the  turnout  is pretty  low; school board  elections usually turn out maybe 20  percent of the electorate, maybe less  than that. Yet I submit there is probably no more  important election  in  America today than school board elections. I will not get into that right  now. What  if we said:  In all these  school board elections, take the yeas,  and then all the people who didn\u2019t vote,  they are a no.  What if we did that in Senate races?  That strikes home to people around  here. Say a Senator is running for reelection, and if you are lucky, you get  a 60-percent turnout of voters. That  means the people who don\u2019t vote are  considered a \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 vote on the incumbent. Is that what we want to see? If  you don\u2019t vote, that is a \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 vote on  your  reelection. Most people would  think that is inherently unfair. It is inherently unfair.  The  same  is  true  in elections on  whether workers want to form a union.  There are a lot of reasons people don\u2019t  vote in an election. Maybe they are  sick and they can\u2019t go vote. Maybe  they can\u2019t make up their mind one way  or the other. Maybe they said: Well, I  see this side, and I see that side, and I  cannot make up my mind, so I am just  not going to vote. Some people just  say: I don\u2019t care which side wins; I am  disinterested in this election. Thankfully, in America, we don\u2019t have somebody forcing somebody to vote. So it  makes common sense that if you don\u2019t  vote, you should not be counted on one  side or the other.  The National Mediation Board put  this rule in place. They went through  all the hearings, the comment period,  and all the stuff necessary to pass the  rule. Then it was brought up in the  Senate within the last year under a  procedure called the Congressional Review Act, wherein there is an expedited  procedure for the Senate to take up  and vote on a regulation as to whether  we want to overturn it. It is an expedited procedure, an up-or-down vote.  That was brought up here, and, as the  chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over labor, I debated it with  my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle. It was a fairly good debate, I  thought, and we voted. The Senate  voted not to overturn that regulation.  Well, you would think that would be  the end of it. No, you would be wrong.  What does that have to do with the  FAA? Because the Republicans in the  House and some in the Senate are saying they are not going to let this FAA  reauthorization bill get through unless  and until we overturn the decision\u2014  this rule of the National Mediation  Board which basically says that if you  don\u2019t vote in the election, you are not  counted on one side or the other. They  are holding  the FAA hostage\u20144,000  workers furloughed, tens of thousands  in airport construction out of work, $25  million a day being  lost  in revenue  that would be taken in so we could put  these people back to work. It is all because they want to make it harder for  workers to form a union.  Think about  it  this way. We are  going to have a Presidential election  next year. Let\u2019s say all the people who  don\u2019t vote would be tallied as a \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019  vote for the incumbent President, assuming he runs for reelection. Some of  my Republican friends would probably  like that, and I understand that. Do  you think the American people would  think that is fair, that if you don\u2019t  vote, you are counted as a \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 vote?  A Federal district court\u2014they took  this  to court\u2014also  rejected a  legal  challenge to these new rules, finding  that the National Mediation Board was  acting well within its legal authority  in modernizing the election.  We see this time and time again. It is  happening now in this Congress. Whenever we try to make things more fair  or to use a legitimate procedure to address something that I think most people would think would be unfair; that  is, counting somebody who didn\u2019t vote  as a \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 vote\u2014when we do that, Republicans always try to find an end run  to try to undo that.  We are down to about 10 percent of  our labor force that is now unionized.  My friends on the other side will not be  happy until there are no more unions  in America. They will not be happy  until unionization is less than 1 percent, and then only a company-sponsored union, not an independent union.  Right now, Republicans are voting to  change the law in the middle of a trial  as a special favor to the Boeing company. Boeing was accused of retaliating  against its workers for going on strike.  As I have pointed out in numerous  talks on the Senate floor, there is a judicial process that has been used by  both labor and management for more  than 70 years to settle disputes. That  process has been to go to the NLRB\u2014  and management has done it, as well as  labor\u2014to find out if a certain thing  was wrong or  if a union has overstepped its bounds or if management  has overstepped its bounds. The NLRB  tries to mediate and get the two sides  to agree, but if they can\u2019t, a process is  set  in motion whereby  the General  Counsel\u2014who, by the way, was a career  person, not a political appointee, as  some have said\u2014then begins an investigation to see whether the facts as  presented warrant the next step, which  is bringing the case to an administrative law judge.  That is what happened in this Boeing  case. I have heard all this nonsense  about how they are trying to take jobs  out of South Carolina, trying to destroy  right-to-work States. That  is  nonsense. Right now, the case is before  an administrative  law  judge  to  see  whether  Boeing  actually  retaliated  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:53 Jul 28, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G28JY6.019 S28JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",

And we won again in 1991.  Bert mentioned  in his acceptance  speech on Sunday that he is the first  Hall of Famer born  in Holland. He  moved to California as a child and became interested in baseball by watching Sandy Koufax pitch for the Dodgers. His father Joe, also a baseball fan,  built him a pitcher\u2019s mound  in the  backyard, where he developed one of  the best curveballs in baseball history.  I would like to think if my dad had  built me\u2014no, I don\u2019t think so.  Bert finished his playing career in  1992. In 1996, he rejoined the Twins in  the broadcast booth, where for many  years he and Dick Bremer have become  familiar voices to Twins fans all over  the upper Midwest. I personally love  nothing more than watching a Twins  game on TV and listening to Dick and  Bert, who, in my humble opinion, are  an authoritative and amazingly entertaining broadcast team.  During broadcasts, Bert has created a  phenomenon using his telestrator to  circle Twins fans who, whether they  are in the Target Field or on the road,  are holding up signs that catch Bert\u2019s  interest, and then he will circle them.  There is no higher honor for a Twins  fan than to be circled by Bert, and  every game is packed with fans holding  signs  that  simply  say  \u2018\u2018Circle Me,  Bert.\u2019\u2019  It was great to see that Bert was  joined at Sunday\u2019s induction ceremony  by his wife Gayle, their children, Bert\u2019s  siblings, and his mother Jenny. During  his speech, Bert spoke about his father  Joe, who died in 2004 of Parkinson\u2019s  disease, saying, \u2018\u2018I know he is up there  right now looking down.\u2019\u2019  In memory of his father, Bert and his  wife Gayle  started  the  \u2018\u2018Circle Me,  Bert\u2019\u2019 Web site to raise research money  for the National Parkinson Foundation  Minnesota. That says volumes about  Bert Blyleven. Bert is known in Minnesota for his dedication to other charities and to the community there.  So, once again, Bert, as a lifelong  Twins fan, thank you and congratulations. After 14 years of waiting, you are  hereby \u2018\u2018circled\u2019\u2019 by the Major League  Baseball Hall of Fame, where generations  of  fans  from Minnesota  and  around the country and around the  world will know of your career and of  your  amazing  contributions  to  the  game of baseball and to the community  of Minnesota.

The Senator  may speak for up to 15 minutes.  f  BIDEN NATIONAL DEBT  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I  think it is obvious to the world around  us that the atmosphere here is hardly  one of comfort or  satisfaction. The  public does not see the agony of the debate that is taking place, as we watch  how dysfunctional the discussion about  the national debt has been.  We feel the threat to America\u2019s world  financial  leadership  that  is  lurking  around here, and it is not very satisfying to those people whose homes are  close to foreclosure or the people who  need to be assured that health care is  going to be there for them or that their  child who can learn can get an education without mortgaging their future  or cannot even get a mortgage on that.  So we look around and we watch and  we listen and we see that the Republicans  in the House and the Republicans in the Senate are in a search for  political gain regardless of the cost to  our society and our Nation.  I do not make this statement casually. But after months of watching  and listening to the targeted goal of  politics over the pain that could follow  a default, no other conclusion may be  drawn. We want to consider the evidence. By way of example, Vice President  convened  a  bipartisan  working group to find solutions to get  the national debt problem over with,  get it resolved, and let us go on to our  normal and needed debate and business. After that, Republicans walked  out. Walked out.  Next, President Obama offered Republicans what he  called a  \u2018\u2018grand  deal\u2019\u2019 that would reduce the deficit by  $4 trillion. Republicans ran away. Now  our majority leader, HARRYREID, has  proposed a plan that  includes more  than $2 trillion in spending cuts, $1 in  cuts for every dollar the debt limit is  increased\u2014and not even insisting on a  dollar of revenues, which has been suggested several times.  But  there  is  no way  of  getting  through the obstinacy on the other  side. Republicans turn their back time  after time. Democrats in this Senate  and in the White House have offered  the  Republicans  compromise  after  compromise. But they do not see their  target. Their target is to do damage to  the Obama administration so that it  hurts  sufficiently  to  discount  the  progress that has been made for our society under President Obama.  Time and time again the Republicans  have changed their demands to  find  reasons to say no. Are we asking the  Republicans to do something radical,  something that has never been done before? That is certainly not the case.  Over the past half century, the debt  ceiling has been raised 75 times, almost  two-thirds of those occasions under Republican Presidents. In fact, the debt  ceiling was increased 18 times under  President Reagan, and 7 times under  President George W. Bush.  Our country has never defaulted. So  the question that must be raised is:  What is different about today? Why, at  a time when we already face a real jobs  crisis  in this country, would Republicans plan for another economic crisis? Why would they do that? Will destroying the economy help Republicans  win seats next year when people across  our  country  are  already  expressing  their dissatisfaction with the deadlock  they see being displayed?  We heard the minority leader say his  No. 1 priority is stopping the President  from winning another term. What a  goal that is. He is our President, elected by the people of the country. He has  a term of 4 years and will be up for reelection. We hope and we pray that he  continues to be the President of our  country. What good does it do to target  the system?  Make known what it is they stand  for. So  far we have seen that they  stand for nothing that is helpful to the  average American. So what we need is  a chance to have an honest discussion.  Insecurity reigns as people grow more  and more conscious about their inability to afford the basics of life, jobs,  health care, education. They see prices  being raised around them as their purchasing power shrinks. Look at the  price of gasoline. You see a perfect example of what is happening. We had  one Republican Presidential candidate  who was asked:  \u2018\u2018Does it strike you  that as the unemployment rate goes up  your chances of winning office also go  up?\u2019\u2019  Do you know what her answer was?  She said, \u2018\u2018I hope so.\u2019\u2019 Hope so. What an  outrageous thing to say from the halls  of government, the high halls of government. I hope so. I hope that unemployment goes up, says she, so she  might have a chance to win office. How  cruel that statement is.  Make  no mistake,  if  the United  States Treasury runs out of cash next  week, the principal burden will fall on  middle-class families. But the effects  on our  total economy will be devastating as well. We may not be able to  send out Social Security checks to seniors, benefit checks to veterans, the  people who serve the country. Let\u2019s  stop paying them? Or paychecks to the  men and women who now bear our  country\u2019s uniform in Afghanistan and  Iraq. Sorry, we cannot pay you. Is that  what we are going to say?  Interest rates could rise almost immediately, greatly increasing the cost  of mortgages, car loans, student loans,  credit cards, you name it. If middle-  class Americans think their 401(k) plan  suffered during the Wall Street crisis a  few years ago, imagine what will happen to the markets if the U.S. Government cannot pay its bills, or redeem  bonds that are ordinarily turned in for  cash.

Now, [they are] bracing for another  blow.  \u2018\u2018We\u2019re concerned that any additional cuts  to hospitals, whether through Medicare or  Medicaid, will have a dramatic impact on  hospitals and health care providers . . . \u2019\u2019  The Illinois Finance Authority\u2014all  of these groups look at this situation  and say: This makes our economy even  worse. It is a self-inflicted, politically  manufactured problem. It  is a crisis  which does not have to exist. Should  we ignore our debt? Of course not.  Madam President, you know I have  worked on this issue for a year and a  half now with more specificity than  ever in my career. I was on the deficit  commission the President appointed.  Then I stuck around afterwards as six  Senators\u2014the Group of 6, we called  ourselves; it was not a very inspired  name, but that is what we came up  with: three Democrats and three Republicans\u2014and we  sat  down  for  6  months and hammered out an agreement among us to reduce our Federal  deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10  years, with a balanced approach that  puts everything on the table\u2014everything\u2014revenue,  entitlements,  spending\u2014everything.  We came to an agreement. We presented our agreement to the Senators  just 2 weeks ago. Forty-nine Senators  showed up at that meeting, Democrats  and Republicans. It was amazing. Then  we followed up and said: Are you ready  to put your name on the bottom line?  Will you support moving forward with  this bipartisan way to deal with the  deficit in a responsible way that does  not endanger our economy and make  us face bankruptcy as a nation?  We now have 36 Senators, Democrats  and Republicans, who have signed up.  That is a pretty good number. It shows  that this is not an idea that we came  up with that does not have legs. Sure,  we are going to have to change it. We  understand that. But look what happened. Democrats and Republicans sat  down\u2014no cameras, no reporters\u2014and  worked out a reasonable way to deal  with the deficit and our Nation\u2019s debt.  What is better? Lurching from this  crisis to another crisis 4 months from  now, as Speaker BOEHNER suggests, or  dealing with this in an honest, bipartisan way today?  Madam President, I can tell you what  the American people want us to do\u2014at  least I think I know what they want us  to do. They do not want us to endanger  this economic recovery. They do not  want us to kill jobs. They do not want  us to hurt businesses. They want us to  help this economy recover and create  jobs. They want us to extend this debt  ceiling so we do not see interest rates  going up across America at exactly the  wrong  time. They certainly do not  want to see us put in a position where  we have to decide between paying Social Security recipients and our soldiers who are in combat. That is what  the administration would face if this  crisis that has been manufactured on  Capitol Hill continues.  What they expect us to do is to earn  our pay as Members of the House and  Senate, to work hard to come up with  a reasonable approach, and to be willing to give a little. It is the only way  you reach a compromise. Compromise  is the nature of this political process.  Those who condemn it\u2014and there are  some who do, who say: Never give up,  stick  to  your  principles,  never  change\u2014we are not going to get a solution. We have to be willing to work together to give and get this done.  Here is what I predict is going to  happen soon.  I predict Speaker BOEHNER is going  to call his bill on the  floor of the  House. We have told him in advance it  is a nonstarter here. If it passes the  House, it will come here, and it will  likely be voted down. We will then propose an alternative.  Majority Leader HARRYREIDhas an  alternative which basically extends the  debt ceiling beyond next year so our  economy has time to recover. It cuts  spending by over $2 trillion so we address our deficit. It does it with a list  of spending cuts that every Republican  has voted for so it is not controversial  in substance. I think that is the best  approach.  He creates a joint committee to deal  with the long-term deficit. I have been  involved  in  those, and  I  think we  should. I think it is a good, balanced  approach that solves our problem and  gets us through this crisis. We are likely to vote on it either tomorrow or the  next day. But we are down to 5 days.  We are running out of time. We have to  get this done.  I want to tell you, any Senator who  comes to the floor and says defaulting  on our debt and reaching the first point  in our history where the credit reputation of the United States is in doubt is  OK, it is a good political tactic, they  do not understand the gravity of that  decision and the impact it will have on  businesses and families for generations  to come.  This notion that we can pick and  choose the checks we are going to send  out in August when we are going to  have 55 or 60 percent of what we need is  going to put us in an impossible position. Deciding among all of the valuable,  important  functions of government which ones will not be funded\u2014  that is an impossible position for this  President to be in. We cannot do that  to him. We cannot do that to our government. We cannot do this to our  country.  I hope that after the House votes  today or tonight, whenever it may be,  that we take up the measure quickly.  Let\u2019s move this forward. Let\u2019s get this  done. Let\u2019s avoid this crisis. Let\u2019s meet  the responsibility we were elected to  address.

Madam President, our  greatest Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, in his drive to end slavery, said \u2018\u2018a house divided against itself  cannot stand.\u2019\u2019 With these few words,  Lincoln is calling to us through the  echoing halls of history. He is calling  for us to put aside our differences and  to become unified into one people, one  Nation, one common purpose.  Mr. Lincoln recognized that the issue  of slavery was tearing this great Nation apart and that it could not survive  half slave and half free. Slavery was  the great unfinished business of our  Founders. The  institution of slavery  was so ingrained in the infant country\u2019s past and future that even Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and  Franklin could not disentangle it. I am  not trying to equate carrying too much  debt with slavery, please understand  that, but the truth remains. A house  divided against itself cannot stand.  This house, this Nation, this Republic,  is  divided  against  itself.  Our  Founders called their effort at establishing a new Nation \u2018\u2018a great experiment\u2019\u2019\u2014and it has been. Nothing like it  had ever been tried and America has  been the unequaled success in all of  world history. Truly, we are the envy  of the world. We began as 13 weak and  barely united States but quickly became  the  strongest  country  in  the  Western Hemisphere. About 70 years  after we adopted the Constitution, we  survived a deadly Civil War. All the  while we grew in stature and in favor  with  other  nations.  Our  economic  power grew rapidly. American  influence grew as we became the agent of  democracy and capitalism for the entire world. Although  our military  power was slow to develop, we fought  on the winning side in two world wars  and we grew into an economic, military and cultural super power.  We are a Nation of immigrants, of  many faiths, of many races and our national  call  to union  is E Pluribus  Unum. Out of many, one. Out of many  States  is  forged one Nation. Out of  many races is forged one people. Out of  many, one. The Founding Fathers had  to balance the agrarian interests of the  South and West with the industrial and  shipping  interests of the North and  East. They balanced small States and  big  States. They  balanced  regions  dominated by the frontier with regions  dominated by the old world. They balanced Catholicism and Protestantism  and Judaism.

It  is about getting  Washington to live within its means, to  quit borrowing 40 cents out of every  dollar it spends, and to put this country on a path fiscally that will ensure  we do not bankrupt the country for future generations, and that we get our  economy back in a place where it can  start growing and creating the jobs we  need to get people in this country back  to work.

But before turning to the issue of the  moment, the need to restore the Nation\u2019s fiscal stability by reducing our  deficits and debt, I want to return to a  matter I discussed on the floor yesterday, and that is the FAA reauthorization bill.  I must respond to some of the comments made by two of my colleagues  earlier  today  regarding  one  of  the  major sticking points in our efforts to  pass  the FAA  reauthorization  bill.  Their arguments are, to put it quite  simply, fallacious and cannot go unanswered.  As you might expect,  these comments were regarding the provision in  the House bill affecting the way votes  are counted in union elections in the  airline  industry. My colleagues,  the  senior Senator from West Virginia and  the junior Senator from Iowa, characterize the House\u2019s actions as some sort  of  radical  endeavor, a  change  that  lacks justification and common sense.  In fact, the Senator from West Virginia even argued that the House\u2019s provisions would \u2018\u2018undo 75 years of labor  law.\u2019\u2019  These were his exact words. Well,  nothing  could  be  further  from  the  truth. In fact, the claim is so far from  being accurate I simply have to assume  that my good friend, Senator ROCKEFELLER, simply misspoke. I know this  is the line the labor unions and the administration are peddling, but here is  the truth: The House of Representatives or Senate Republicans are not  trying to undo 75 years of labor law, it  is the National Mediation Board\u2014or  NMB, I will call it\u2014that has already  done so in a highly partisan fashion.  It  is the NMB, controlled by pro-  union appointees of President Obama  that  in a partisan way unilaterally  undid 75 years of labor law, and put  their finger on the scale for the unions  that  bankroll  Democratic  political  campaigns.  I know what I am talking about. I  won the American Jurisprudence prize  for labor law. I have led labor fights on  the floor for our side for the last 35  years. House and Senate Republicans  are only trying to restore long-lasting  labor law following its highly partisan  corruption by the National Mediation  Board. This is not an opinion. This is  fact.  Put  the  talking  points  and  revisionist history aside, this is what you  have: a highly partisan NMB changing  75 years of settled law, settled labor  law, to benefit the Democrats\u2019 political  allies. For 75 years, NMB-supervised  elections required that a union receive  the votes of a majority of the entire  workforce before  it can be certified.  That has been the law. There is good  reason for it. This was not just a mathematical trick to disadvantage unions,  as my colleagues have argued. It  is  plain common sense.  Let\u2019s suppose, for example, that only  50 percent of a proposed bargaining  unit votes in a union election, and the  union wins by a very slim majority of  the votes cast. In that case, a union  representative would be certified with  only the demonstrated support of one-  fourth of the bargaining unit. That is  what would happen if we follow the  language the NMB fallaciously put into  their ruling. One-quarter of a workforce could vote to certify a union and  bind every other coworker to have to  live with that decision. Apparently a  commitment to Democratic and true  majority rule only matters to the left  when it suits them. What is going on in  this country is outrageous, not just at  the National Mediation Board but the  NLRB as well. Democratic  radicals,  very brilliant  labor  lawyers, who do  not give a darn about what the law is,  are now starting to change the laws by  regulatory fiat.  Apparently a commitment to democratic and true majority rule only matters when it suits certain people\u2019s politics.  The Senator  from  Iowa  compared  these votes to Senate and schoolboard  elections, suggesting that only a majority of those voting is necessary to  prevail. This is a misguided comparison. First, union elections are not a  choice among competing  representatives. They are, instead, held to determine whether the workers want to be  represented at all. Even setting that  aside,  how many  schoolboards  are  going to be empowered to make decisions that affect every hour of every  day an employee goes to work? How  many Senators are elected to serve a  small, narrowly defined group of constituents? And, in the end, if your vote  is  not  counted  in  a  Senate  or  schoolboard election, you will get another chance to vote a few years down  the line.  Employees  voting  in  these  union  elections have no such options. That is  why the law has been completely different from what my two friends and  colleagues have said on the floor. Requiring the support of the majority of  the whole unit  before  certifying  a  union representative only makes common sense. This is why the procedure  at NMB used for these elections went  unchanged  for  75 years. Boards appointed by Democratic Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Johnson, Carter, and  Clinton all agreed with that process  that the House bill is only attempting  to restore.  In fact, the NMB appointed by President Carter unanimously ruled it did  not have authority to administratively  change the form of the NMB\u2019s ballot  used in representation elections, and  that such a change, if appropriate, can  only be made by Congress. That makes  sense.  Yet today we have an administration  bent on greasing the rails in favor of  the unions, and a Democratic Senate  all too willing to go along with  it.  They are so willing that they have  opted to stall passage of the FAA reauthorization to prevent Congress from  restoring a system that served the Nation and airline industry well for decades. This is another example of the  administration showing its true colors.  Rather than provide certainty to travelers, the transportation industry, and  airports, they are holding up a long-  term FAA reauthorization in order to  benefit their union allies. It is wrong.  This type of thing should not go on.  Nor  should  the National Mediation  Board be issuing what ought to be congressional decisions.

            "116": "July 28, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S5015  REMEMBERING DR. DON LINKER  \u2211Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my  colleagues to join me in honoring the  memory of Dr. Donald Linker of Marin  County, who passed away on June 16,  2011. Dr. Linker dedicated his personal  and professional life to helping others  and was passionate about living his life  to the fullest.  Donald Linker was born and raised in  Louisville, KY. He graduated from the  University of Michigan and received  his doctor of medicine from the University of Kentucky, School of Medicine.  Don served honorably  in the U.S.  Navy as a doctor treating marines in  Vietnam. After his service, he moved  to San Francisco, married, and had  three children. He opened his own medical practice and after many years of  practicing medicine, returned to school  and  received his master\u2019s  in public  health from UC Berkeley.  Don Linker was an activist and philanthropist who was  committed  to  bettering his community. He was a  founding member of the Foundation for  Reed Schools  in Tiburon  and  also  served a number of other organizations, including the Jewish Community  Federation, the American Israel Public  Affairs Committee, the Marin Community Federation,  the Bernard Osher  Foundation, and the Buck Center for  Research and Aging.  Don was an adventurous man with a  fiery demeanor and an infectious spirit  who loved travel and extreme sports.  One of his passions was pushing himself  to  the  limit  physically. He  loved  windsurfing,  skiing,  and mountain  biking, and some of his greatest personal accomplishments involved those  activities.  Don was a friend who will be greatly  missed by all  those whose  lives he  touched.  I send my heartfelt sympathies to his  family, including his son Kevin Linker,  daughters Jodi Linker and Dana Linker, son-in-law Richard Steele, brother  Stephen Linker and his grandchildren  Lauren and Sarah Steele.\u2211  f  TRIBUTE TO JORDAN BURROUGHS  \u2211Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the best  collegiate wrestler in America, Jordan  Burroughs, who  is an All-American  from my alma mater, the University of  Nebraska-Lincoln.  Earlier this year Jordan was awarded  the Dan Hodge Trophy, which is often  referred to as the \u2018\u2018Heisman Trophy of  wrestling.\u2019\u2019 This award  is named  in  honor  of  Dan  Hodge,  who  was  undefeated during his 3-year career at  the University of Oklahoma. The criteria considered for the Hodge Trophy,  according  to  the University of Nebraska, are the wrestler\u2019s record, number of pins, dominance on the mat, past  credentials,  quality  of  competition,  sportsmanship, and heart.  Wrestling at 165 pounds, Jordan compiled an impressive 36-to-0 record this  last season and captured his second  crown  from  the National Collegiate  Athletic Association; his first was in  2009. Despite Nebraska facing one of  the toughest schedules in the Nation  this  year,  Jordan  had  only  three  matches this season which did not end  by pin, tech fall, or a major decision.  Congratulations also go to Nebraska\u2019s head wrestling coach, Mark Manning, who recruited Jordan from Winslow  Township  High  School  in  Sicklerville, NJ, where Jordan was listed as  the  seventh best high  school  wrestler in the country. As Coach Manning says, \u2018\u2018Winning the Hodge Trophy  puts Jordan in an elite group of wrestlers and makes a strong statement  about him as an athlete.\u2019\u2019  Most  recently,  Jordan  Burroughs  added to his list of impressive tournament wins by taking home his first  senior  international wrestling  gold  medal on July 17, 2011, at the Outstanding Ukrainian Wrestlers Memorial  International  in Kiev, Ukraine.  There will be other matches between  now and next year, but his ultimate  goal is to compete at the 2012 Summer  Olympics in London, England.  From  the Garden  State  to  the  Cornhusker State, Jordan Burroughs  makes us all proud as America\u2019s best  collegiate wrestler of 2011. As a former  Husker, he will forever remain in the  hearts of Big Red fans everywhere who  will continue rooting for him wherever  his travels take him.\u2211  f  TRIBUTE TO PAMELA LYNNE  WELLER  \u2211Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President,  today  I wish honor Pamela Lynne  Weller, legal special assistant to Commissioner Thomas H. Moore at the U.S.  Consumer Product Safety Commission,  CPSC. Ms. Weller is retiring after more  than 26 years of distinguished Federal  Government service.  Pamela was born in Baltimore and  has lived in Maryland for most of her  life. She graduated with honors from  the University of Maryland and  received her law degree from Georgetown  University.  Pamela began her Federal  service  during her  last year of  law school,  when she worked for Senator Lawton  Chiles on the Government in the Sunshine Act, Public Law 94\u2013409, and later  for Senator Richard Stone. For part of  that time she actually worked for both  Senators simultaneously, for Senator  Chiles as part of a law school program  and as a salaried employee of Senator  Stone. After graduation, she continued  working for Senator Stone on a variety  of important issues through the end of  his term of office.  After  leaving Senator Stone,  she  went to work at the Civil Aeronautics  Board, CAB, as an assistant to board  member James Smith, as the agency  worked through the deregulation of the  national  air  transportation  system,  and then as it wound down its operations prior to being incorporated into  the Department of Transportation.  Following nearly 10 years of continuous government service, Pamela went  to work in the private sector, opening  her own law practice. She continued in  this line of work for over 11 years, specializing in family law and real estate  transactions.  In 1995, she went back into the public  service to become an assistant to Commissioner Thomas H. Moore at the U.S.  Consumer Product Safety Commission.  During her work  for Commissioner  Moore, the  longest serving Commissioner in the agency\u2019s history, she advised him on all agency actions including rulemakings, enforcement actions  and administrative matters. Additionally, she served as acting chief of staff  during Commissioner Moore\u2019s 9-month  stint as acting chairman of the agency  in 2001 and 2002. She also helped construct his 2007 legislative proposals to  Congress, a number of which were incorporated into the Consumer Product  Safety Improvement Act of 2008, Public  Law 110\u2013314.  During her notable tenure at CPSC,  Ms. Weller has played a significant role  in protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury posed by consumer  products. On numerous occasions, she  has demonstrated inspiring leadership  and has always been considered a valued employee at the CPSC.  Mr. President, I am pleased to thank  Pamela Lynne Weller for her honorable  service to our Nation, and I wish her a  rewarding retirement.\u2211  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  which were referred to the appropriate  committees.

            "132": "E1434  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014Extensions of Remarks July 28, 2011  Systems Network (FEWS NET), which is supported by USAID, two areas of southern Somalia are already experiencing famine. Famine exists when at least 20 percent of the population has extremely limited access to basic  food requirements, acute malnutrition exceeds  30 percent, and the death rate exceeds 2 out  of every 10,000 people per day for the entire  population. Death rates are above the famine  threshold  in  two  areas  and  are  elevated  across the south. Tens of thousands of people  have already died in the past three months.  FEWS NET projects that famine will spread  across all regions of southern Somalia within  one  to  two months. The network estimates  that 3.7 million people are in crisis nationwide,  and 3.2 million of them require immediate, lifesaving assistance. These severe conditions  are expected to remain at least through December of this year. FEWS NET has declared  this Africa\u2019s worst  food security crisis since  Somalia\u2019s 1991\u20131992 famine.  The effects of the drought in Somalia have  been exacerbated by the lack of an effective  central  government  and  continuing  conflict  with al-Shabaab terrorists.  Drought has also affected Kenya and Ethiopia, where the situation is complicated by the  arrival of large numbers of refugees from Somalia, many of them suffering from acute malnutrition.  The U.S. Government has already spent a  total of approximately $458.7 million on humanitarian assistance  in  the Horn of Africa  during fiscal year 2011. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement on July 20th  expressing concern on behalf of the U.S. Government. She  noted  that  additional  international assistance  for  the region  is needed  and announced an additional $28 million  in  U.S. assistance to Somalia and Somali refugees in Kenya. However, more needs to be  done. FEWS NET has called  for an  immediate,  large-scale,  and  comprehensive  response to save tens of thousands of lives.  I am deeply concerned that the State and  Foreign Operations appropriations bill for fiscal  year 2012, which was marked up yesterday,  will not provide sufficient funds for critical priorities like these. The bill includes an 18 percent cut  in development assistance, which  funds projects such as food security and basic  education. The bill also cuts international disaster assistance by 12 percent compared to  the fiscal year 2011 level and a shocking 42  percent compared  to  the  fiscal year 2010  level. Such drastically reduced funding levels  will not allow the United States to help millions  of people in need or respond to emergencies,  such as famines, hurricanes and earthquakes.  I have seen children who were starving. It is  a terrible sight to see. We cannot sit by idly  and allow thousands of children to die and not  take any action to help them. To do so would  be contrary to our national interests and contrary to our values.  I call upon my colleagues and  indeed all  Americans to show compassion to our brothers and sisters in Africa. And I call upon the  U.S. Government  to organize a comprehensive effort to save the lives of millions of hungry people throughout the Horn of Africa.  HONORING THE DISTINGUISHED  CAREER OF CRAIG PROSSER  HON. DAVID WU  OFOREGON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2011  Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute to Craig Prosser, retiring city manager  of Tigard, Oregon. Craig has announced his  retirement at the end of July, capping a 35-  year career of distinguished service  to our  community.  Craig began serving Tigard in 1999 as finance director, and since 2005, as city manager. Craig\u2019s accomplishments include the formation of the city\u2019s first urban renewal district,  the Tigard-Lake Oswego Water Partnership,  as well as major improvements along Pacific  Highway. He also oversaw the opening of the  Westside Express Service Commuter line that  runs through Tigard. Craig\u2019s foresight helped  to make Tigard an attractive place to live and  do  business.  Because  of  his  leadership,  Tigard was able to retain crucial city services  through one of the worst financial crises in our  country\u2019s history.  Craig has been a consensus builder who  has always focused on the needs of the citizens, and he has worked tirelessly to address  their concerns. He has approached his work  with integrity and a true sense of dedication  while empowering staff and those around him.  In his retirement announcement Craig said, \u2018\u2018I  would be willing to put the City of Tigard staff  up against any public workforce in the state, if  not the nation. The citizens of Tigard are fortunate to have such dedicated elected officials  and public employees working on  their behalf.\u2019\u2019  Former Oregon Governor Tom McCall once  said,  \u2018\u2018Heroes are not giant statues  framed  against a red sky. They are people who say,  this is my community, and it is my responsibility to make it better.\u2019\u2019 Craig Prosser truly is  an American hero, for he has devoted much of  his life to making his community better.  It is my distinct honor to recognize Craig for  his outstanding service and for providing a heroic example to us all.  f  HONORING UNITED  STATES MARINE  LANCE  CORPORAL  CODY  JAMES ELLIOTT  HON. LOIS CAPPS  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2011  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  honor 21-year-old United States Marine Lance  Corporal Cody James Elliott of Pismo Beach,  California. On June 12, 2011, while out on patrol, LCPL Elliott ran  to help his Brother  in  Arms, Josh McDaniels, who had been injured  in an IED explosion. While en route to his fallen comrade\u2014without regard for his own safety\u2014LCPL Elliott was severely wounded by another  IED explosion. Every day, magnificent  men such as Cody shine on the battlefields of  honor, bringing their light of heroism and selflessness to the darkness of war\u2014making us  all proud to be Americans. In the blast, LCPL  Cody  lost his  left  leg, broke his  tibia  in his  right leg, and lost one of his fingers. In just a  few short weeks, he has come a long way in  dealing with his wounds and  is moving  full  speed towards recovery. With the help of his  family, he continues to recover and show us  what it means to bravely serve our country. I  ask that this poem penned in his honor by Albert Caswell be placed in the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD.  RUNTOME  (By Albert Caswell)  All  Run . . .  Run to me . . .  On battlefields of honor bright . . .  There are but all of those who so carry the  fight!  All with their most magnificent light! To  win that day, to that night!  Who so shine, all in their most sacrificial  light . . .  Who for all of their Brothers In Arms, are  but so ready to die!  All in the blood that binds them, this most  sacrificial tie!  Which brings such tears to the Angel\u2019s eyes!  As it was on the day in June, when Cody you  so ran . . . as your heart so swooned!  As your Brother Josh lay dying, as you ran  to him . . . not asking why then!  in your most magnificent  shades of  green, oh yea you United States Marine!  As when that bomb went off, as you lie there  in all its cost . . .  All in what you had given, all in what you  had lost!  As the tears rolled down your face, all in  what this war had brought!  As up ahead but lie a new front . . .  Only twenty-one years old, and barely hanging on . . .  As it was then there you so saw you had a  choice!  As you told yourself, get up Marine  . . .  while  listening  to your most  inner  voice!  As from deep down within, but came such a  force!  As now Cody, your new life would so begin  . . .  With that first step, all in that pain and  heartache which lie so up ahead . . .  As somehow, you lifted up your fine head  and so said!  I did not die, I am not dead! As you so chose  to feel that wind upon your face . . .  for your Fallen Brothers, all  in your  heart they now so hold such a special  place!  For you\u2019ve got a life to live, as now you  picked up the pace!  A life to lead, as it\u2019s now Cody you\u2019ve so chosen to move at light speed!  For you are a United States Marine, all in  what your recovery has so seen . . .  You see, people like you Cody . . . so give to  us all what we so need!  Because, You So Teach Us! And You So Beseech Us!  As so deep down inside, You So Reach Us!  With all of your most courageous faith, You  So Speak To Us Out On Our Ways!  For you will run, and you will breathe . and oh yea Cody you will so succeed!  And if I ever, I so have a son . . . I pray that  he may  be  as  courageous  as  you  my son . . .  Whose heart to me so runs! Because, Cody in  heaven you need not arms or legs, and  that\u2019s where you are going one day . . .  And, you will hear our Lord so say, \u2018\u2018Cody,  Run To Me!\u2019\u2019  All for what you gave, Run To Me!  All  . .

            "4": "August 26, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014Extensions of Remarks E1531  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS IN HONOR OF PETER DOUGLAS  HON. SAM FARR  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 26, 2011  Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor the long and distinguished public service career of my dear friend Peter Douglas.  Peter is retiring after nearly 26 years as the  California Coastal Commission\u2019s Executive Director, a post that he has held continuously  since 1985, longer than any other director of  a California State agency. In that time he has  done more than any other individual to shape  the California Coastal Commission and by extension  the California coast we know  today.  So I think it appropriate that we honor his vision, dedication, and  tenacity  in doing as  much as humanly possible to keep the California coast natural, open, and accessible.  Peter has always had a knack  for pulling  success  from  challenging  circumstances.  Peter\u2019s Jewish mother gave birth to him while  living in Berlin, Germany, in 1942. His family  managed to escape to Mexico and then, in the  early 1950s, to the United States. Peter went  on to graduate from UCLA in 1965 and later  from  the UCLA  law school  in 1969. After a  brief law practice, Peter went to work for Assemblyman Alan Sieroty, a Democrat  from  Beverly Hills. And that is when I first met him  and where he really started his work as a troublemaker and paradigm shifter par excellence.  In the late 1950s, my father, the late State  Senator Fred Farr, authored an early version  of a California Coastal Act, but  the politics  were not yet  there  to support  its passage.  Peter helped change that by drafting an updated version of my  father\u2019s  legislation  that  this time went to the voters as Proposition 20.  As part of the grass roots campaign to pass  Prop 20, Peter, with a little help from me and  some others, organized a coastal bike  ride  along the coast from far north to the Mexican  border. With Prop 20\u2019s passage the California  Coastal Commission was born. Peter  then  went  to work  for  the Assembly Natural Resources Committee and the Select Committee  on Coastal Protection, from where he helped  draft  the 1976 California Coastal Act, which  made the Coastal Commission permanent and  set  in motion  the creation of  local coastal  plans and the other basic elements of California\u2019s coastal protection framework.  Peter then went to work for the Commission  as its Chief Deputy, a position he held until his  1985 appointment as the Commission\u2019s executive director. As Executive Director, Peter led  the Commission\u2019s development  into  the bulwark of California coastal protection that it is  today. He has described the measure of his  success as the things that we don\u2019t see: the  wetlands  left unfilled;  the scenic vistas  left  open; the coastal habitat still available for wildlife; and even the coastal amenities now open  to minorities. Others have measured his success with a catalogue of awards and recognition too long to detail here. Of course this has  not come without controversy. He has  frequently tangled with the rich and powerful over  various coastal development proposals and  has survived over a dozen attempts to remove  him.  Unfortunately, illness has done what lobbyists could not. His long running struggle with  cancer has forced Peter to step down from his  executive director position. I know I speak for  many of my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, in thanking Peter for his selfless service and in wishing him and his family and friends all the best.  f  TRIBUTE TO 70TH MCAFEE FAMILY  REUNION IN SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS  HON. CHARLES A. GONZALEZ  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 26, 2011  Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues  to  join me  in honoring  the McAfee  family for celebrating their 70th family reunion  in San Antonio, Texas.  On Saturday, August 27, 2011, members of  the McAfee  family will gather at Rodriguez  City Park in San Antonio to celebrate a tradition of coming  together  that has  lasted 70  years. The McAfee Family Reunion began in  1941 with the family of William and Charlotte  Newton McAfee, and their nine children. This  year, four of the McAfee children from the initial reunion will be celebrating their 70th continuous  McAfee  Family  Reunion:  Harold  McAfee, Delton McAfee King, Doris McAfee  Walker, and Joseph McAfee.  At the core of American values is a commitment to family, and I want to thank all of the  members of the McAfee family for their incredible dedication to each other. They are truly a  model for families all across our great country,  and I am honored to have their family celebrate such a tremendous milestone in my district. The McAfee  family\u2019s steadfast embodiment of family values is an inspiration, and I  wish  them years of continued happiness  for  generations to come.  f  RECOGNIZING WOMEN\u2019S EQUALITY  DAY BY PROTECTING WOMEN\u2019S  HEALTH  HON. LAURA RICHARDSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 26, 2011  Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  recognize August 26 as Women\u2019s  Equality Day, which marks the date in 1920  that women earned the right to vote. Today,  we celebrate women\u2019s equality in the United  States after so many years of being treated as  second-class citizens, denied  the  full  rights  and privileges of male citizens.  Mr. Speaker, voting rights are now an institutionalized right for all women. Any attempt to  weaken or withdraw them would be met with  universal public condemnation. Unfortunately,  there are other historic advances for women  which face an uncertain future. One of these  is Medicare, which 1 in 5 women rely on for  basic health insurance protection.  Since its enactment, Medicare has been a  great equalizer for women\u2019s rights. By removing some of the burdens associated with being  primary caregivers, Medicare freed women to  pursue roles outside the home.  Unfortunately, even  in  retirement, women  are more likely to be dependent on Medicare  than men. It is a critical source of health insurance coverage for nearly all older women in  the United States and  for many  younger  women  who  have  permanent  disabilities.  Nearly half, 49 percent, of women on Medicare have three or more chronic health conditions and 57 percent of women on the program live below the federal poverty level.  Mr. Speaker, Medicare is a social insurance  program  that provides health  insurance coverage to all people who are aged 65 and over  as well as  those who are permanently disabled.  Like women\u2019s suffrage, Medicare endured a  long and difficult battle to be signed into law  since it was first called for by President Truman in 1946. It was introduced in Congress  every session from 1952 to 1964 and was defeated each time. Finally passed as part of the  Great Society  initiative under President Lyndon B. Johnson, Medicare was signed into law  in Independence, Missouri on July 30,1965.  Johnson chose Independence as a tribute to  President Harry  Truman\u2019s  efforts  to  pass  Medicare decades before and enrolled  the  former President as the first Medicare beneficiary. Medicare has four different parts: Hospital Coverage, Medical  Insurance, Medicare  Advantage Plans, and Prescription Drug Plans  which help to cover the cost of inpatient care  in hospitals, doctor\u2019s visits, hospital outpatient  care, preventative services, and  the cost of  prescription drugs.  Since the beginning of the program, Medicare has had a profound impact on the health  and well-being of older women. In 1964, only  51 percent of Americans 65 and older had  health care coverage, nearly 30 percent of  seniors lived below the poverty line and the  average  life expectancy of Americans was  70.2 years old.  Today, virtually all Americans 65 and older  have health care coverage, only 8.9 percent of  seniors live below the poverty line and the average  life expectancy of Americans has  increased to 78.2 years old. Additionally, Medicare provides affordable health care coverage  to over 47 million Americans, including 39 million seniors and 8 million Americans under 65  with disabilities. Among  the oldest Medicare  beneficiaries,  those 85 years and older\u201470  percent are women.  Mr.  Speaker, Medicare  is  popular  and  strongly supported by the majority of American  women, with 72 percent regarding Medicare  as extremely important to their retirement security.  \u2211 This \u2018\u2018bullet\u2019\u2019 symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

MIKE COFFMAN  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 2, 2011  Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado. Mr. Speaker,  today  I  rise  today  to  recognize  the Piney  Creek Colorado chapter of the Daughters of  the American Revolution, DAR, for its commitment to preserving American history and fostering patriotism across the country.  The parent society\u2019s history dates back to  1890, a time marked by a revival in patriotism  and an intense interest in the beginnings of  the United States. While  the Piney Creek  chapter was only chartered in 2004, the energy and dedication directed towards the local  community has enhanced  the  lives of many  Coloradans.  The founders of DAR sought to create an  organization which would commemorate  the  patriots of the American Revolution, cultivating  national pride  in  its members and  in  local  communities. The Piney Creek DAR superbly  embodies these tenants, and tirelessly works  to forward the organization\u2019s mission of perpetuating  the memory of  those who contributed  to American  Independence, promoting  educational endeavors as instructed by President George Washington,  and  cherishing  American institutions of freedom.  National events organized by DAR, such as  Constitution Week, celebrate the foundations  of democracy and contribute to the education  of communities. Started in 1955, Constitution  Week seeks to honor and reaffirm the ideals  outlined by our Founding Fathers in 1787. The  Piney Creek chapter of  the DAR has  truly  taken heart in this annual event and has gone  above and beyond to thoughtfully promote the  importance of  the Constitution. From sponsoring and performing education programs  about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights at  local  elementary  schools,  to  disseminating  pocket Constitutions to students and patrons,  the Piney Creek DAR has captured the spirit  of this important week. Moreover, their work  promoting the ideals of the Constitution continues throughout the year by sponsoring high  school Advance Placement U.S. American  History Classrooms and partnering with local  libraries  to  publicly  display  copies  of  our  founding documents.  These efforts and others demonstrate  the  Piney Creek DAR\u2019s exceptional dedication to  country and community. I\u2019m incredibly proud to  have such dedicated volunteers residing in the  6th district of Colorado, and I am certain that  the Piney Creek DAR will continue to serve as  an example of American spirit both past and  future.  RECOGNIZING THE 48TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON  HON. LAURA RICHARDSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 2, 2011  Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, yesterday,  August 28, was  the 48th anniversary of  the  historic March on Washington,  the most  famous act of peaceful protest in our nation\u2019s  history. I rise to pay tribute to the great Americans who conceived, organized, executed and  participated in the March for Jobs and Freedom. That march was a seminal event in our  nation\u2019s history and awakened Americans of  goodwill to the urgent need to rededicate ourselves to the great unfinished task of making  real the promise of America for all Americans,  especially African Americans.  The March on Washington  for Jobs and  Freedom was  a  nonviolent,  political  demonstration  that advocated  for civil rights and  economic  justice  for African Americans. The  march and rally  took place on  the National  Mall in Washington DC on August 28, 1963,  the 100th anniversary of the issuance of President Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation.  Mr. Speaker, 1963 was a year of racial strife  and unrest, preceded by centuries of legalized  discrimination and  inequality against African  Americans, who faced higher levels of unemployment, lower wages, substandard housing  and inferior educational opportunities.  The march was organized by a coalition of  religious, labor and civil rights organizations,  including  the  \u2018\u2018Big Six\u2019\u2019: Congress of Racial  Equality (CORE), Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Student Nonviolent  Coordinating Committee (SNCC); National Association  for  the Advancement of Colored  People (NAACP); the National Urban League;  and the International Brotherhood of Sleeping  Car Porters.  In May 1963, A. Phillip Randolph, President  of  the  International Brotherhood of Sleeping  Car Porters, wrote to Interior Secretary Stewart Udall requesting a permit for a march culminating at the Lincoln Memorial that fall. As  preparations for the march on the mall went  underway,  the  list of organizations participating in and sponsoring the event expanded  significantly.  On the day of the march, a quarter of a million people from all over the nation gathered  at the Washington Monument and marched together to Lincoln\u2019s Memorial, where the crowd  listened to musical performances, engaged in  prayer and listened to inspirational speeches  encouraging  the crowd  to stand up  for  their  civil rights.  The diversity of those in attendance was reflected in the event\u2019s speakers and performers  including singers such as Bob Dylan and Marian Anderson and actors Harry Belafonte,  Ossie Davis, and Ruby Dee. Attendees  included people of all genders, races, religions,  and nationalities. Among  the  luminaries who  addressed the gathering was John Lewis, who  was then the 23-year-old Chairman of the Student  Non-Violent  Coordinating  Committee  (SNCC) and now one of  the most beloved  members of  the U.S. House of Representatives.  It was at the March on Washington that the  Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered  his famous, \u2018\u2018I Have a Dream\u2019\u2019 speech which  is universally considered by historians and  scholars as one of the greatest speeches in  American history. Beneath the gaze of President Lincoln, Dr. King challenged the Nation to  make  real  the promise of America  for all  Americans and shared his dream that his \u2018\u2018four  little children will one day  live  in a nation  where they will not be judged by the color of  their skin but by  the content of  their character.\u2019\u2019  The March on Washington was a defining  moment of the rapidly expanding Civil Rights  Movement of the 1960\u2019s and is credited with  galvanizing  the  federal government  to enact  the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The March on Washington demonstrated  the power of non violent direct action to effect  social and political change. An enduring legacy of the March on Washington is that it was  the model and  inspiration  for  future social  movements around  the world,  from Eastern  Europe  to South Africa  to  the Arab Spring  uprisings witnessed earlier this year.  Therefore, I rise with pride and gratitude for  the brave and courageous men and women  who worked to organize the March on Washington. They fought, struggled and risked their  lives in order to ensure a better nation for future generations. The  leaders of  the Civil  Rights Movement and  the March on Washington will be  forever  remembered  for  their  courageous  leadership  and  sacrifices  that  made our country better.  But, the best way to pay tribute to these heroes is to continue the fight for jobs and freedom. With  the national unemployment  rate  above 9 percent\u2014and 15.9 percent for African  Americans\u2014joblessness  in  America  has  reached crisis proportions requiring dramatic  action  to put people back  to work. Making  sure that all Americans can find jobs that pay  enough to raise a family, own a home, educate their children, and care for their parents  is the pressing challenge of our time and is  the unfinished work to which we must rededicate ourselves today.  f  A TRIBUTE TO HOWARD COLLEGE  ON ITS 65TH ANNIVERSARY  HON.

            "4": "H6104  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE September 13, 2011  since  Morning Star Baptist Church  September of 1999.  Prior to serving in Omaha, Reverend  Adams\u2019 ministry spanned more than a  decade in Lawton, Oklahoma, and includes serving as a pastor in Stuttgart,  Germany, for 2 years. Reverend Adams  has earned his bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and  doctoral degrees  from the Andersonville Baptist Seminary, and he  is a  graduate  of  the  Harvard  Divinity  School\u2019s Leadership Institute.  He has made his country a priority.  He is an 8-year veteran, having served  honorably in the United States Army.  He has made our Omaha community a  priority, particularly the more vulnerable citizens, our youth, and our seniors.  When youth violence arose  in our  community,  it  was  Reverend  Dr.  Adams who reached out to other pastors in North Omaha to unify efforts  and message against the violence  in  our neighborhoods. He has reached out  to help our seniors who needed housing.  Reverend Adams is nationally known  as a wonderful preacher, a great teacher, an irreplaceable pillar in our community, and a friend to many. He is  blessed by his two children, Leroy and  Maria, and Omaha is, in turn, blessed  by this minister and his family.  May God continue to bless his life,  his family, and his ministry for years  to come.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  YODER). The Chair will entertain up to  15 further requests for 1-minute speeches on each side of the aisle.  f  \u2018\u2018YES\u2019\u2019 TO JOBS  (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, data  from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  shows that while 14 million Americans  are looking for work, there are only 3  million job openings. This means that  if every single job was filled outright,  there would still be 11 million Americans unemployed and looking for work.  Passing the President\u2019s jobs bill will  help these people and help our overall  economy. According to Mark Zandi,  Moody\u2019s  economist,  the President\u2019s  plan would add 2 percentage points to  the GDP growth next year, add 1.9 million jobs by next year, and cut the unemployment rate by 1 percentage point  next year.  Published  reports  indicate  that  economists across this country are giving the President\u2019s plan a thumb\u2019s up.  This is a clear chance for all of us to  say \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019\u2014yes to growth, yes to a middle class tax cut, and, most  importantly, yes to  jobs and our overall  economy.  PRESIDENT\u2019S SECOND STIMULUS  INCREASES DEBT AND TAXES  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, last Thursday the President  addressed a joint session of Congress in  order to describe his second stimulus.  This proposal would create $447 billion  in new spending, being paid for by tax  increases.  House  Republicans  remain  committed to working together in order to  create job growth and promote an environment that allows  for small businesses to hire workers. Sadly, the administration\u2019s  proposal  pushes  new  taxes on small businesses, which would  create an environment that destroys  jobs. The President was previously correct, saying you do not increase taxes  in a recession. Raising taxes destroys  jobs.  The administration\u2019s  last  stimulus  added $814 billion to our debt. More importantly, it failed to accomplish the  goal of keeping unemployment below  18 percent. Currently, 14 million people  are unemployed and 25 million who  want a full-time job do not have one.  The House Republicans have passed  numerous bills to create jobs. House  Republicans have shown their commitment to jump-starting the ability of  small businesses to create jobs.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th in the global war on terrorism.  f  JOBS  (Ms. HOCHUL asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  Ms. HOCHUL. Mr. Speaker, I come  from a part of this country where my  constituents  are  real  down-to-earth  people, commonsense people.  We want a good education for our  kids, we want Medicare and Social Security for our seniors, and we want the  Buffalo Bills to continue their winning  streak. But more than anything, we  want to get our people back to work\u2014  for our kids who thought a college education was the ticket to a good job, for  our veterans who stepped out of line to  go fight and protect us who now find  themselves in the unemployment line,  and for middle managers who thought  they were set for life until the day the  pink slip showed up on their desk and  turned their lives upside down.  We all know we have to get this  country back to work. We need to pass  the American Jobs Act to do just that.  Just 24 hours ago, Democrats and Republicans stood shoulder to shoulder on  the steps of this Capitol, united in remembrance of 10 years ago, the 10th  anniversary of 9/11. Why can\u2019t we stand  together again and do what\u2019s right for  the American people, Democrats and  Republicans shoulder to shoulder? If we  get the job done here, people out there  will get jobs.  f  JOB CREATION  (Mr. FINCHER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I come  to the floor this morning to discuss the  need to create jobs, my priority since I  arrived here in January.  Last Thursday,  the President  addressed Congress about his proposal to  create jobs and move this country forward. We must do better.  Recently, I introduced two bills that  are my proposals to help spur job creation:  I  introduced the America\u2019s Energy  Independence Act, which would prevent  the EPA from enforcing its cross-State  pollution rule for 10 years to keep the  flow of electricity high and the cost of  electricity for America\u2019s families low.  The President  recognized  that  the  EPA\u2019s new smog standards would lead  to job losses, but he played politics and  only  rescinded  the  standards  until  right after the election.  I also introduced the Invest in America Act, which would suspend the capital gains tax for 10 years, providing  more certainty  to  families who are  being penalized for selling their homes,  their investments and farms.  Instead of spending money we don\u2019t  have on  initiatives that don\u2019t work,  these  bills  provide  actual  help  to  Americans so they can get back to the  business of making America great.  f  b1210  REGULATING CORPORATE  ELECTION EXPENDITURES  (Ms. EDWARDS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, John  Paul Stevens warned that the Supreme  Court\u2019s  ruling  in  Citizens  United  threatened to undermine the integrity  of  elected  institutions  around  the  country. How right he was.  Since the Court\u2019s decision last January, corporate special  interests have  had unprecedented freedom to spend on  our elections. In fact, campaign spending by outside groups surged to more  than $300 million in the 2010 election  cycle and are already off the charts for  this cycle. Likewise, State laws that  limited corporate bankrolling of candidates have been struck down.  Mr. Speaker, we have unprecedented  challenges in front of us. But how do  we make  the  tough choices on  the  economy, on taxes, on protecting the  vulnerable and investing in the future  and creating  jobs? We cannot stand  idly by while deeply flawed interpretations of the Constitution are used to  obstruct our democracy rather than  guiding it, putting lobbyists and piles  of cash into policy and elections.

            "12": "H6112  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE September 13, 2011  until the end of this month. So we  think this is being good stewards and  responsible, again, in extending for 6  months a period in which there can be  some  stability  in  these  important  transportation projects, and also  to  make certain that  jobs and employment in this area move forward.  In July, I released a transportation  reauthorization proposal. This was an  outline. We\u2019ve been working with our  Democrat colleagues  in a bipartisan  fashion  since  that  time  to actually  craft language which is acceptable to  set forth the policy and the funding  schedule,  all  of  the  authorization  that\u2019s so important to keep our Nation\u2019s  infrastructure projects moving  forward. So this should give us enough  time to complete that process and get  that legislation before us. With unemployment in the construction industry  at record-high  levels,  it\u2019s  imperative  that we also provide this time.  Let me talk about FAA for a minute.  This bill does authorize funds through  the end of January for FAA. This is a  list of extensions of FAA. I had the opportunity, as the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, in 2003 to craft a 4-  year FAA bill, which expired in 2007. So  I helped write the last FAA 4-year authorization that expired in 2007. Here  are the extensions.  The Democrats controlled the House  of Representatives  and  the Senate.  Here, if you start in when you had the  Obama administration take over, they  also controlled the White House, the  House, and the Senate. And we get  down to the 17th extension under Democrat control, and I have agreed to  three of them. I said enough is enough,  and we must move forward with a long-  term authorization. I stand before you  today and say that, while the measures  that we took in the last extension for  FAA were  somewhat  extraordinary,  this situation demands attention and  action for long-term legislation by the  United States Congress, and I\u2019m going  to make certain that we do everything  to see that people are working in this  industry and that we meet our responsibility for setting the policy for one of  the most important industries in the  United States, our aviation industry.  So this is the history of what has  taken place. This is the 22nd extension,  and I can guarantee it will be the last  extension because we must and we will  pass  a  4-year  authorization. While  there are some issues that remain to be  resolved, we will continue working in a  bipartisan manner. We passed legislation from the House. I look forward to  working with Senator ROCKEFELLER  and others, KAYBAILEYHUTCHISON, the  ranking Republican in the Senate, Mr.  COSTELLOand Mr. RAHALL, to get this  legislation done.  I urge my colleagues to support these  two extensions rolled  into one, H.R.  2887.  HOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES,  COMMITTEEONWAYSANDMEANS,  Washington, DC, September 13, 2011.  Hon. JOHNMICA,  Chairman, Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure,  Rayburn  House  Office  Building, Washington, DC.  DEARCHAIRMANMICA: I am writing concerning H.R.  2887,  the  \u2018\u2018Surface and Air  Transportation Programs Extension Act of  2011,\u2019\u2019 which is scheduled for floor consideration today.  As you know, the Committee on Ways and  Means has  jurisdiction over  the  Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC). Sections 141 and 142 of this bill amend the IRC  by extending  the current Highway Trust  Fund expenditure authority and the associated Federal excise taxes to March 31, 2012.  Section 141 also amends the IRC by extending the Leaking Underground Storage Tank  Trust Fund excise tax to March 31, 2012.  Similarly, Sections 202 and 203 of this bill  amend the IRC by extending the current Airport and Airway Trust Fund expenditure authority and the associated Federal excise  taxes to January 31, 2012. In order to expedite H.R. 2887 for Floor consideration, the  Committee will forgo action on the bill. This  is being done with the understanding that it  does not in any way prejudice the Committee  with respect to the appointment of conferees  or its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or  similar legislation.  I would appreciate your response to this  letter, confirming this understanding with  respect to H.R. 2887, and would ask that a  copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record  during Floor consideration.  Sincerely,  DAVECAMP,  Chairman.  HOUSE OFREPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ONTRANSPORTATION AND  INFRASTRUCTURE,  Washington, DC, September 13, 2011.  Hon. DAVECAMP,  Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,  Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.  DEARMR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your  letter regarding H.R. 2887, the \u2018\u2018Surface and  Air Transportation Programs Extension Act  of 2011.\u2019\u2019 The Committee on Transportation  and Infrastructure recognizes the Committee  on Ways and Means has a jurisdictional interest in H.R. 2887, and I appreciate your effort to facilitate consideration of this bill.  I concur with you that forgoing action on  H.R. 2887 does not in any way prejudice the  Committee on Ways and Means with respect  to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill  or similar legislation in the future, and I  would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees  to any House-Senate conference  involving  this legislation.  I, or my designee, will include our letters  on H.R. 2887 in the CONGRESSIONALRECORD  during House Floor consideration of the bill.  Again, I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation, and I look forward to  working with the Committee on Ways and  Means as the bill moves through the legislative process.  Sincerely,  JOHNL. MICA,  Chairman.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.R. 2887, the Surface and Air Transportation Programs  Extension Act of 2011. In this regard, I  do commend  the Senate and House  leadership for arriving at an agreement  late Friday afternoon on an extension  of our Nation\u2019s surface transportation  programs through March 31, 2012, and  the programs under the FAA through  January 31, 2012, at the current funding  levels and without any adverse policy  riders.  I commend our chairman, Mr. MICA;  the subcommittee chair, Mr. DUNCAN,  on Surface;  the Air Subcommittee  chair, Mr. PETRI; and our ranking subcommittee members, Mr. COSTELLOon  Aviation and Mr. DEFAZIOon Surface.  Extending these programs is critical  to our economic  recovery. And  the  pending measure does so without any  of the poison pills of the past or draconian cuts to investment in our surface  transportation  programs. Failure  to  extend the surface transportation programs  could  shut down more  than  134,000  active  highway  and  bridge  projects and over 5,000 active transit  projects, jeopardizing the jobs of more  than 1 million private-sector American  jobs over the next year.  The  funding  levels  in the pending  measure are far more preferable than  what we are seeing proposed by Republicans  on  the Appropriations Committee. Just last week, they rolled out  a fiscal year 2012 Transportation appropriations bill which proposes to slash  highway and transit  investment, destroying more than 600,000 good paying,  private-sector American jobs, jobs that  would be lost in every State of the  Union.  I cannot support these dangerous and  draconian  cuts  to  investments  in  America\u2019s future. To keep pace with  India, China,  and  our  other  international competitors, we need to invest  more, not less in America\u2019s future. If  we stop investing in the future, there is  simply no way we can retire the debt of  the past.  It is my hope that with this 6-month  extension of highway, highway safety,  and transit programs, we can come together and work to develop a  long-  term,  robust Surface Transportation  authorization bill that keeps the Nation economically competitive, meets  the demands of the 21st century, and  creates millions of family-wage American jobs.  b1240  The pending measure also provides  for a clear extension in the Nation\u2019s  aviation programs under the FAA. Our  aviation system is slightly more than a  month  into  its  recovery  from  the  shock, the shock of a Republican-led  FAA shutdown for 2 weeks in July and  August; and I\u2019m pleased that my Republican  friends have chosen not to  force another shutdown. I trust they  recognize the damage that was caused  to our Nation\u2019s aviation system and  the financial hardship placed on working-class families across the country  when they chose to force a policy rider  into an otherwise clean extension in  July and caused a  senseless  2-week  shutdown of major parts of the FAA.

            "28": "H6128  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE September 13, 2011  Take, for instance, the Department  of Education. Everybody says, well, we  need to have a Department of Education. Why? Education is supposed to  be conducted at the State and local  level, controlled by the State and local  governments. But we have an Education Department, and what has the  Education Department contributed to  our society? The quality of education  has gone down, down, down, to where  we\u2019re one of the least educated, as far  as the quality of education  is concerned, least educated countries in the  western world, in the industrial world.  So the Department of Education really  isn\u2019t contributing anything except gobbling up an awful lot of our taxpayers\u2019  dollars. There\u2019s a whole host of agencies like that that we need to get rid of  because we don\u2019t have the money to  pay for them.  And yet the President came up the  other night and he spoke in this Chamber, and he said we\u2019re going to have to  spend another $447 billion for a jobs  bill. It\u2019s the same old story being written again and again by the administration. That\u2019s what we tried to do with  the bailout and the stimulus bill and  these other things.  Remember the shovel-ready projects?  The President  said, well, we didn\u2019t  have as many shovel-ready projects as  we wanted to. As a result, we didn\u2019t see  anything except more and more unemployment.  Throwing money at the problem does  not solve the problem. All it does is  cost the taxpayers more money, either  in taxes or in a hidden tax that they  pay when they go to buy food, clothes,  groceries, or gasoline to get to and  from work; and that\u2019s the problem that  we have right now.  The President has a socialistic European approach to government. He believes that government ought to control health care. He believes that government ought to control the energy  sector. And if we pass what was called  cap-and-trade, which would deal with  energy and the emission of CO2into the  atmosphere, it would raise the cost of  electricity and everything else that we  use dramatically. In fact, he said himself during his campaign, or even before that, that cap-and-trade would essentially cause the prices to skyrocket  for energy, just another thing that the  American people have to pay for.  We don\u2019t have  the money  in our  pockets. People\u2019s salaries aren\u2019t going  up. We\u2019ve got a huge number of people  unemployed. We\u2019re paying unemployment to them on a weekly basis so that  they can survive. They don\u2019t have the  money.  But the government keeps spending  and spending and spending, and we can  no longer afford it because it\u2019s going to  hit us with higher taxes. That\u2019s what  he talked about right here last week:  more taxes that we don\u2019t have, more  spending that we can\u2019t afford, which  leads to more inflation that people are  feeling right now.  b1510  And if people don\u2019t believe me who  may be paying attention to this, and  I\u2019m talking to my colleagues back in  their offices, talk to your wife or your  husband when they buy gasoline or go  to the store. The average inflation rate  right now I would guess is somewhere  around 13 percent, and that is something we cannot afford. It\u2019s going to  kill this economy and kill this country  as the country that we\u2019ve known all of  our lives, and what we\u2019re passing on to  our children is a lower standard of living than we\u2019ve had, and we cannot afford that any longer.  What we need to do  is streamline  government, go back into our entitlements\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  Security\u2014and figure out better ways,  not eliminate them, but better ways to  solve that problem. This House has  sent a plan over to the Senate that  would do that in an efficient and economic way and not bankrupt the country and solve that problem.  We need to go through every agency  of government, and if they\u2019re not doing  their job or if they\u2019re not necessary,  get rid of them, cut them out, reduce  the size of government, cut government spending.  Then, in addition to that, we ought  to do like Ronald Reagan did when he  came into office and we had double-  digit inflation; double-digit unemployment, and double-digit interest rates.  It was actually as bad or worse than it  is right now. And he came in and he  said instead of raising taxes, as they  said he had to do, because they said  that would  bring  revenue  into  the  Treasury, he said, no, we\u2019re going to  cut taxes.  And the reason he did that was because  if you  raise  taxes, you  take  money out of business, you take money  out of people\u2019s pockets, and  that\u2019s  money they can\u2019t spend. If they don\u2019t  spend, they can\u2019t buy. If they can\u2019t  buy, we don\u2019t produce. And if you don\u2019t  produce, more and more people who do  the producing are laid off and are going  to the unemployment lines.  Conversely, if you cut taxes, you give  business and industry more money to  invest. You  give  individuals more  money to spend. They can buy more  and invest more, and we produce more  because people can buy it, and that creates jobs. And when we create jobs, we  create more taxpayers. And we went  from $500 billion in tax revenue under  Reagan to $1.3 trillion\u2014almost triple\u2014  because we cut taxes and stimulated  economic growth.  This administration believes in more  government control over our entire  economy and our society, and that\u2019s  the reason we\u2019re in the mess we\u2019re in  today, because government cannot create something unless it takes something away. We can\u2019t give jobs that the  government creates unless we take it  from  you,  the  taxpayer,  and  that  means  either  raise  taxes  or  spend  money we don\u2019t have and print it, and  that creates inflation, which is a hidden tax on everybody in this country.  The bottom line is this country is in  a very difficult situation. I serve as  chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia. I\u2019m going to be going  to Greece in a couple of weeks. Greece  has  a  socialistic  economy. They\u2019re  going down the tubes right now, and  they\u2019re trying to find some way to bail  themselves out. They\u2019re raising taxes.  They\u2019re raising taxes on everything,  electricity,  everything  they  can.  They\u2019re cutting the benefits to the people that work there because the benefits have been too high and the government can\u2019t afford them. All of these  things, the salaries are being cut.  And what\u2019s happening in Greece is  it\u2019s going belly up. And the effect of it  is on all of the other countries that  have investments in Greece, the banking, the financial institutions, all of  them are really in trouble, and they\u2019re  talking about a potential domino effect  because of the failure of Greece and because of the socialistic approach that  they\u2019ve taken.  Italy\u2019s in trouble, Portugal\u2019s in trouble, Spain\u2019s in trouble, even France is  in trouble because they\u2019ve invested a  lot of money through the financial institutions into Greece. The whole European continent\u2019s in trouble because  of the socialistic approach to government.  The thing that\u2019s kept America so  strong all of our lives is free enterprise,  the profit incentive for a businessman  or a person to say, I want to make  something of myself. And they open a  gas station or a store and they work  their tails off, and they have a chance  to make their lives better. But when  government starts taking over everything, it ruins it. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening in many countries in Europe,  especially Greece.  So if any of my colleagues are paying  attention on the Democrat side of the  aisle or who are Independents or who  are on the Republican side, I hope that  you will realize the number one thing  we have to do right now is get this government under control.  We need to cut regulations so business isn\u2019t strangled by the regulations  that are costing them more and more  money that they have to pass on to the  consumer or they have to fire people  because they can\u2019t afford them. We\u2019ve  got to cut taxes to stimulate economic  growth,  and  that will  bring more  money into the Treasury, just like it  did under President Reagan. And we\u2019ve  got to make sure that we eliminate unnecessary spending in these agencies of  government  like  the Department of  Education. Get rid of them because  they\u2019re not doing anything except gobbling up our money.  If we do that, we\u2019re going to turn this  country around, and we will remain the  greatest country in the history of mankind. If we don\u2019t, if we continue down  the road that this administration  is  taking us down, moving us towards socialism,  toward  government  control  over health care, energy, everything,  then we\u2019ll see the quality of life that  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:59 Sep 14, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K13SE7.053 H13SEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",
            "36": "H6136  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE September 13, 2011  We were told if we did not pass the  President\u2019s stimulus package back in  early 2009, he said the unemployment  rate, Mr. Speaker, might go as high as  81\u20442 percent. That 81\u20442 percent sounds  pretty good. People remember him saying, Well, gee, if you\u2019ll pass this, unemployment will be around 8 percent at  the worst. Wrong. But if you don\u2019t pass  it, it could go as high as 81\u20442percent. I\u2019d  take that 81\u20442 percent right now and  have everybody that got that money  give it back because it was, for the  most part, wasted.  Now, people back then were told by  the President, It\u2019s a stimulus bill. It\u2019s  all about infrastructure. We\u2019re going to  have this money go to infrastructure.  Well, there was only a tiny pittance of  what may have been more like a trillion dollars that went to infrastructure. That goes through page 16 with  that part.  We get into first responder stabilization, and there is $5 billion for one program, $4 billion for another program, $1  billion for the Attorney General first  responder  stabilization  fund. Oh,  I  guess $4 billion\u2019s for the Attorney General to carry out the competitive grant  program.  It keeps being lost on people here  that America\u2019s better off if you don\u2019t  force people at the point of imprisonment, and IRS persecution, to give all  of this money to Washington and then  we\u2019ll dole it out as we see fit. The economy does better when you let people  keep their own money and only bring  just as much as necessary. Don\u2019t try to  run everybody\u2019s lives.  But at page 17, we\u2019re going to give all  of this money to the Attorney General\u2019s Office and let them dole it out as  they see fit. And we\u2019ve seen that if  you\u2019re a friend of the administration,  you\u2019re going to do well. If you\u2019re not,  they\u2019re going to sic on you all of the  power of the bureaucratic, whether it\u2019s  EPA,  all  of  these  administration\u2019s  tools and you\u2019ll pay a price. We\u2019re finding that out in Texas.  Now, you go to the next page, page  18. You\u2019ve got elementary and  secondary schools. They\u2019re supposed to  get money. But, of course, it\u2019s going to  come through Washington because we  know best. And we\u2019re going to dole  some money to the States. We\u2019re going  to dole some to State and local applications as indicated on page 19.  But you can\u2019t miss this. It\u2019s throughout the bill. Page 20, here we go again.  b1630  We saw it with the Solyndra fiasco in  California and this administration giving away $500 million that can\u2019t be accounted  for  now\u2014just  squandered.  Well, we\u2019re going  to do  that  some  more. Maybe  if we keep  throwing  money at a bad idea it will somehow,  someday, in some way get a little better. So page 20 has got us prioritizing  green practices kind of like a bankrupt  Spain has done.  Now, there is money in here, page 21.  This is nice\u2014money even for private  schools, but only if they have a child  poverty rate of at  least 40 percent.  Then we\u2019ve  got  community  college  modernization and more green  jobs  within the colleges, Page 23, and you  go on and on. I mean, I went through  this. It does go on and on.  Then we\u2019re told we\u2019re going to invest.  This time we really, really mean it. We  said we really meant it back in January of \u201909 that we\u2019re going to have infrastructure, and that\u2019s going to bring  us up. We said it. We didn\u2019t spend it on  infrastructure. We  squandered  it on  ACORN and all these different groups,  but this time we really, really, really  mean it. Let\u2019s see. That looks like it\u2019s  $2 billion for that program, and on and  on.  It\u2019s  interesting. We\u2019ve got all this  money we\u2019re going to put toward highways and whatnot. Now, anyone, Mr.  Speaker, who believed  this was all  going to go straight to infrastructure  missed the point, because then we get  over to page 40, and you get to the real  jobs. This is where the jobs are really  created. It starts on page 40. It\u2019s called  the American Infrastructure Financing  Authority.  If you  love Fannie  and  Freddie, you\u2019re going to love the American Infrastructure Financing Authority.  On page 41, you\u2019ll find out there are  seven voting members appointed by the  President. Well, he\u2019s good at creating  jobs\u2014look at all the government jobs  he has added\u2014so that\u2019s who I want  having appointed. I mean, he has appointed all these people from universities who have never created jobs in  their lives, so they\u2019re perplexed as to  why their programs aren\u2019t working. He  does have the head of GE who\u2019s helping  him with that jobs program. China is  grateful. China is very grateful to the  head of GE because he has created lots  of jobs\u2014they\u2019re just in China and not  here. Maybe he\u2019ll get to be on this  board as well. But it\u2019s another government program.  Let\u2019s see. I want to make sure I get  this right. The board of directors\u2019 first  appointees  will  be  deemed  the  incorporators  of  AIFA\u2014that\u2019s  the  American Infrastructure Financing Authority\u2014but that will make for some  good reading. I wouldn\u2019t read it right  before going to bed because you might  not be able to go to sleep.  Then we get over to page 56. This  talks about the funding of the American Infrastructure Financing Authority and the administrative fees, which  is section 257. Then we get into that it  has hereby appropriated AIFA to carry  out this act for the cost of direct loans  and loan guarantees except for the limitations under section 253 and for administrative costs of $10 billion that  remain available until expended. Then  you\u2019ve got some other moneys there,  but that\u2019s good news because you can  spend  that  for administrative costs.  Fortunately, in Washington, we don\u2019t  run up much in the way of administrative costs.  Now, one  thing  that  some people  have talked about to raise a little bit  of  revenue  is  to  sell  some of our  broadband  spectrum. Then we  also  know that there are those in Washington who are not happy that the FCC  has not been able to have a Fairness  Doctrine so they can dictate what goes  on the air. Well, not to worry because  people, it seems, are going more and  more to broadband than to radio waves  and  television waves. We\u2019re getting  more and more broadband stuff. So we  have the answer to the lack of a Fairness Doctrine that the FCC has wanted  under this administration, but we\u2019ve  been able to avoid it so far.  There  is nothing about a Fairness  Doctrine in here, but fortunately, you  get to page 75, and you find out we\u2019re  going to establish\u2014I love this name\u2014a  Public Safety Broadband Corporation.  On the next page, 76, you find out it  has established a private, nonprofit  corporation, and you\u2019re going to have  some members who know how to run a  government operation and create government jobs. Of course it killed jobs in  the private sector, but  it\u2019s creating  government  jobs. That\u2019s down here.  You\u2019ve got the Secretary of Commerce,  the Secretary of Homeland Security,  the Attorney General\u2014we\u2019re  talking  real job creators here\u2014and others who  will be on that board. So people can  feel better about that.  If you don\u2019t  think we have enough government control of things, well, this bill, you\u2019re  going to love it: more government control, more government corporations.  The thing that many missed\u2014and it  jumped out at me as I sat back there  and the President spoke\u2014is when he  said we want to work side by side with  business. For people who have ears and  can hear, that means this President  wants  to be your business partner.  That scares some folks, and that\u2019s why  I think you saw the market go down  the next day. People who understand  how real jobs in the real world are created know that the government being  partners with people trying to generate  jobs is a job killer. We don\u2019t need a  government  to be partners,  side by  side, working with business. The government, as designed by the Founders  and as we\u2019re supposed to be carrying  out, is supposed to be a referee to make  sure people play fair. If the government  had made sure people were playing fair  instead of dictating every detail of  their existence, then they would have  noticed that Bernie Madoff was cheating people, but the government\u2014our  bureaucracy\u2014was too concerned with  dictating how people live, and they forgot about their job as referee.  I highlighted so much stuff as I went  through the night, but I won\u2019t bore you  with all of this, Mr. Speaker. Let\u2019s see:  Public Safety Roaming and Priority  Access. The FCC is going to get the report on the efficient use of public safety spectrum. Oh, extended benefit provisions. There\u2019s good stuff there.  I\u2019ve been a fan of retraining people  when there are jobs in one sector and  people have lost jobs in another, and  there are no  jobs with the training  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:27 Sep 14, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K13SE7.068 H13SEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",
            "44": "S5510  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE September 13, 2011  a carefully constructed plan to get this  economy moving forward. What really  troubles the Republican leader\u2014and I  know he said as much this morning\u2014is  that President Obama pays for it. Over  and over, we hear from the Republican  side: Don\u2019t add to the deficit. Pay for  what you do.  The President came out yesterday  with his proposal of how to pay for it.  How does he pay for it? For one, he  takes away the subsidy to the oil companies. There is a Federal subsidy that  comes out of the Treasury and goes to  oil companies across America, raises  gasoline prices through the roof, making them able to enjoy the biggest  business profits in the history of the  United States. Isn\u2019t it time to cut back  on that subsidy and use those resources  for  the President\u2019s plan  to get  the  economy moving forward?  The President limits the tax deductions and credits for those in higher income categories. I find it hard to understand why the Republican position  is that we cannot ask those who are  well off, the most comfortable people  in America, to pay one penny more in  taxes. Their position is absolute: not  one  penny more  in  taxes  for  the  wealthiest in America. I think it is fair  to limit the tax cuts to the wealthiest  so that we can provide tax cuts for  working families. That is sensible. It is  not only morally right, it is economically right, and it troubles me when I  hear the Republican leader reject that  out of hand.  It appears that the warmth of the  August Sun  is cooling now  in September, and those who went home and  heard how unhappy America is with  congressional roadblocks and obstruction have forgotten that lesson. They  have forgotten what they heard. They  are coming back now and saying that  once again we are going to have a face-  off and a confrontation.  f  DISASTER RELIEF  Mr. DURBIN. There is one other area  I wish to speak to. I know my colleague from New York is going to be on  the floor shortly. The area I wish to  speak to is disaster relief.  I strongly support the disaster relief  funding bill. As Americans undertake  the physically and  emotionally difficult task of rebuilding, cleaning up,  and  recovering  from hurricanes and  flooding  and  even  earthquakes, we  must see that the Disaster Relief Fund  is there so they can get back to their  own lives as quickly as possible.  The year 2011 has been a record year  when it comes to natural disasters. The  cost of recovery from Hurricane Irene  alone could reach $1.5 billion. We have  seen it this year in Illinois. It has been  tough  from Chicago to Cairo  in the  southern portion of our State. We have  had blizzards and floods and tornadoes  and troubles all around. Our State, like  most other States, has seen the damage and has felt it personally. People  are trying to put their homes back together again.  Here is a photo\u2014I saw this in person  when I visited the State earlier this  spring\u2014around Cairo in the southern  part of the State. It was an awful situation. We had flooding along the Ohio  River that troubled and bothered the  folks who live in southern Illinois as  well as Kentucky and adjoining States,  Missouri. Some of our towns, such as  Cairo, were literally threatened with  being inundated. They had to blow levees, which basically means to open up  a place  for the river water to  flow.  That flooded farmland in Missouri and  Illinois, and we have to be sensitive to  the  fact that there were real  losses  there that need to be paid for. That  record  flooding  really  slammed  the  southern part of our State. The devastation was felt in the entire region.  The damage was not  just there. I  hear from people throughout the southern part of the State who are still  struggling today because of this flooding. Anthony Miles in Urbandale, IL, is  an example. Flooding from the Ohio  River rose so high that he could not  even find his lawnmower in the front  yard. All he could see was the river  water.  In Metropolis,  IL, my  friend  Mayor Billy McDaniel said that people  are still trying to get the floodwater  damage repaired in that town months  later. Harrah\u2019s casino  in Metropolis,  which is a major employer and source  of revenue in that area, was completely  inundated with water, and hundreds of  thousands of dollars in repairs need to  be done.  Some argue when it comes to these  disasters that we cannot afford to help  people in America. It appears to me  that the guiding principle and motto of  the tea party in America is this: Just  remember we are all in this alone. That  is what we hear over and over from  them. Whenever we have a problem facing us in America where we come together as a family to solve it, the tea  party stands on the sidelines and says:  Don\u2019t do it. Let them fail.  This morning, Senator REIDquoted a  leading  tea  party  advocate  in  the  House who said: The Federal Emergency Management Agency should be  put out of business.  I wonder where he lives. I wonder if  his home has been spared. I wonder if  he has seen people who through no  fault of their own have lost everything  because of a disaster. When that happens in America, we step in and help  one another. We don\u2019t get tied up in  some political debate. We don\u2019t find  ourselves  completely  stopped  from  stepping  forward and doing what  is  right, and we can\u2019t let it happen this  time either.  Those who say we have to cut other  government programs and education,  medical research, for example, to pay  for the devastation, whether from Hurricane Irene or flooding or earthquakes  or tornadoes, I just don\u2019t think they  understand there are critical areas of  government spending that have been  cut back already, and to cut them even  further would jeopardize the future of  the well-being of  this  country and  many families.  I wanted to show a chart here which  demonstrates the amount requested by  the administration over the years by  different Presidents  for the Disaster  Relief Fund. In each and every one of  these cases, regardless of whether it  was a Democratic or Republican administration, how much of these funds  do you think were offset with funds  from other accounts  in the Federal  budget? None. Zero. In 2000, when more  than $3.5 billion was appropriated for  disaster recovery, how much was offset? None. In 2005 and 2006, when communities all over the South were recovering from Hurricane Katrina and more  than $2 billion was appropriated each  of these 2 years for recovery, how much  of that was offset? None. Under Republican Presidents,  such  as President  Bush, as well as Democratic Presidents, such as Presidents Clinton and  Obama, we have not required offsets in  the rest of the budget when we have  literally  faced a disaster. We have  stepped up, provided the money, and  moved forward.  The number and cost of disasters  have grown dramatically over the past  few years. I do not want to engage the  Senate  in the debate about climate  change because I know people get red  in the face and want to come to the  floor and tell us their political views of  the science of this question. But I will  tell you this: The property and casualty  insurance  industry of America  testified before my committee recently  and said they see what  is coming\u2014  more disasters and more costs than we  ever imagined. One of the experts said  to be prepared to say every summer of  your life from this point forward: This  is the hottest summer I can ever remember. That  is what the  future  is  going to hold.  As  these  temperature  swings  get  worse and worse, they precipitate these  terrible storms. I am not an expert on  much, but I am perhaps a little bit of  an expert after almost 30 years of flying 48 roundtrips a year between Illinois and Washington, flying on commercial airplanes. I think I know a little bit about that, maybe even a little  more than most. This is one of the  roughest periods I can remember. For  the  last several months, the storms  and turbulence have been greater than  I can ever recall. I hope it is an anomaly. I hope it never happens again. We  are told by the experts it is likely to  continue. It means more storms, more  damage, more disasters, and we do not  have the funding here in Washington  waiting to pay for it.  We have to step forward as the need  arises and meet our obligations to the  families and businesses that have been  negatively affected. We know that this  damage which I showed in the southern  part of my State reaches all over the  State. This is an area of Galena, IL,  the home of General Grant, the President, Ulysses S. Grant, and this area in  the northwest part of my State also  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:56 Sep 14, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G13SE6.008 S13SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",
            "52": "S5518  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE September 13, 2011  What is going on here? This has never  been a partisan issue.  Republican Governors whose States  have been hard hit have called for help.  Chris Christie, hardly a wallflower,  hardly someone who doesn\u2019t relish a  partisan battle when he thinks it is  right, but to his credit, when he thinks  it is wrong:  Our people are suffering now and they need  support now. And they, Congress, can all go  down there and get back to work and figure  out the budget cuts later.  That is Governor Christie.  Governor Bob McDonnell,  known conservative:  a well-  My concern is that we help people in need.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the time to get into the  deficit debate.  Are my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle listening? Let us begin to  debate this bill. Let us move forward,  and let us fund FEMA fully. Let\u2019s not  put something in the CR and say, Well,  in a month from now we will debate it.  We all know CRs get tied up. FEMA  has run out of money now\u2014now. So  this vote will be a vote that determines  whether we keep the American tradition of helping one another in a time of  disaster here in America; and a vote no  says, no, I don\u2019t want to do it. A vote  no says I am not going to proceed to  even debate  the bill. A vote no  is  against the greatness of America, in  my opinion, because we always have  stood for helping people, being one Nation, under God,  indivisible. When a  part of the country desperately needs  help, we all pull together to help them,  knowing that if, God forbid, it happens  to us down the road, the Nation will be  there for us.  I was just at the 9/11 memorial service, the tenth anniversary. It was a  time when we  all  pulled  together.  George Bush did not ask, when we were  in the Oval Office and said New York  desperately needed $20 billion, Is it a  blue State? How are we going to pay  for it? He stepped to the plate. He was  a patriot and he said: This  is what  America must do.  That was a manmade disaster, an  awful disaster. Far more lives were lost  than now. But  it  is not a different  issue. This is a disaster, and people are  hurting and people need help. The attitude of President George Bush hopefully will be the attitude of our colleagues across  the aisle,  that  they  won\u2019t block the bill, that they won\u2019t  find seven excuses, or say, We will give  you a little of the money a month from  now in a continuing resolution, when  the money is desperately needed now.  In conclusion, this vote is a crucial  vote that says: Are we the same American people we have always been, who  look out for one another, who help one  another in a time of need, regardless of  party and regardless of bickering and  everything else? This vote will determine it. I urge a strong bipartisan vote  for the resolution that we will vote on  in an hour.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator  from New York for those very descriptive and moving comments about his  State, and particularly the part of his  State that we don\u2019t hear a lot about.  That is why we depend on the Senators  to speak the truth about what is going  on and what they are seeing. I know  the Senator from New Jersey is here to  speak, but pictures are worth a thousand words and I wanted to put this  chart up. I hope the cameras can grasp  the horror of all four of these pictures.  What  is  I think most telling about  them is they are all from a different  State in a different part of the country.  This  picture  is  of Joplin, MO.  I  haven\u2019t myself personally been to Joplin, but before the year is out I will go,  and I think other Senators should go  see what has happened in one of the  great tornado disasters in the history  of our country.  This picture, which almost brings  tears to my eyes because it looks exactly as Lake Pontchartrain looked in  the city of New Orleans, I believe is  from Irene, from North Carolina. It is  heartbreaking. I am sure this is a family who was on the coast, and everything they had is destroyed. It really is  quite moving.  This is a picture on the Mississippi  River, I am not sure in what county.  But when our Senators come to the  floor to talk about rural areas and the  devastation, at least in Missouri, you  can walk down the street and find a  neighbor whose home was equally destroyed and at least get a hug. Out here  in these rural areas, you are by yourself. It could be miles between your  house and your neighbor\u2019s home. You  cannot even find the church where you  worshipped together on Sunday.  Here is Texas. We prayed for the rain  last week to go west to Texas. It hit  Louisiana again. They are the ones  who need it, but they cannot get it.  There were 20,000 fires in Texas. There  were thousands of homes burned up.  Before  everybody  starts  to  think,  what is the great help\u2014yes, FEMA is a  great help. But let me put this in perspective. You get  $2,000 a  family\u2014  $2,000\u2014to  help  buy  a  toothbrush,  maybe a few pieces of clothing, some  initial toiletries, et cetera, and you get  $30,000 for some immediate needs. It is  not as if we are trying to send people $1  million a house. How can people stand  in  the way of  $2,000  for  immediate  needs and $30,000? If you had a house  that was worth $150,000 and you ran a  little printing business and you lost  both, the most you could get out of  this bill is $30,000. Do they think we are  being too generous? It is minimum support. I want to make that clear\u2014minimum support.  Some people are  lucky enough to  have insurance. If the insurance company steps up and does not try to pull  out  the  fine print, as  they did  in  Katrina, and come up with 100,000 excuses why they can\u2019t fund the homes,  maybe they will get homes. This isn\u2019t  us just trying to dump millions of dollars on people who do not deserve it.  That is what I wanted to say. I will  have more to say, but I think these pictures speak 1,000 words. Again, FEMA  is out of money. I don\u2019t want anybody  coming here to vote to say: I didn\u2019t  vote because FEMA has money. They  are out of money. They are stopping  projects all over the country because  all  they  can  basically  do  is  have  enough money to pay those immediate  needs on the east coast. Joplin, MO,  has been told: No, you have to wait.  Louisiana, on the gulf coast, has been  told: No, you have to wait. We are  happy to wait a few weeks. We understand the dilemma. But this cannot go  on week  after week, month  after  month. We have to pass a bill for an entire year and not have to come back to  it.  I see the Senator from New Jersey on  the floor, so I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate the passion of the Senator  from Louisiana and her personal experience  from Louisiana on  the  consequences of disaster. She speaks from  firsthand knowledge and speaks for all  of us in this respect.  I rise today because we as a nation  have always come  together  to help  each other in times of crisis without  question, without politics. In my 20  years between the House and the Senate, I never questioned, in the midst of  a disaster somewhere in the country\u2014  which, fortunately, for the most part  has not been New Jersey\u2014casting my  vote to support those fellow Americans  who found themselves in urgent need  because of natural disasters having  nothing to do with any control they  had whatsoever.  This is not the time to politicize disaster aid. It is not who we are or what  we expect this Nation to be. Our goal  when disaster strikes is to unleash the  full force of the Federal Government to  help families in trouble and communities in ruin, not to score some political points by slowing relief and calling  it responsible fiscal policy. In the wake  of a storm, when the floodwaters rise,  when the winds blow, when the storm  surge rushes in, we should not be rallying our political base; we should be  rallying the full force of emergency responders to help.  In the last few weeks, the east coast  has suffered an earthquake, a hurricane, and some of the worst flooding  my State has seen in years\u2014a 100-year  flood. I received a letter from a constituent  in Moors Landing,  in Monmouth County, who wrote:  Dear Senator MENENDEZ,  I live in Moors Landing, a development of  homes in Howell Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey. Our community is in great  need of assistance. One section of our community was devastated by flooding from an  overflow of the Manasquan inlet on August  20 and 21. Homes and property were destroyed, and the families and lives of those  homeowners were terribly disrupted.

            "60": "S5526  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE September 13, 2011  but a new rule every day does nothing  to promote predictability and is the  very definition of uncertainty.  The President talked about uncertainty just recently. The main source  of uncertainty in the economy right  now is Washington\u2019s regulations. Yet  there was not a single sentence about  regulations in the President\u2019s address  just this week.  To make things worse, the people  most victimized by this uncertainty  are  the  very  people  the President  claims he wants to help. The President  said last year that when it comes to  job creation, he wants to, as he said,  \u2018\u2018start where most new jobs do\u2014with  small businesses.\u2019\u2019 The  sentiment  is  right, but, again, what has he done  about it? According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, businesses with fewer  than  20  employees  incur  regulatory  costs that are 42 percent higher than  larger businesses with up to 500 employees, and that is not counting the  avalanche of new regulations that will  come down the road. This year, over  50,000 pages of regulations have been  added to the Federal Register already,  and the chamber of commerce has said  that the President\u2019s new health care  law alone will produce \u2018\u201830,000 pages of  new health  care  regulations, many  aimed at small employers.\u2019\u2019  The President has said he will keep  trying every new idea that works and  listen to every good proposal, no matter which party comes up with it. I  have a pretty simple idea. If the President wants to know which proposals  will work to create  jobs, maybe he  should require his regulatory agencies  to tell him how their own actions will  affect the job market.  Congressman LEETERRYof Nebraska  and I have a bill that will do just that.  It  is called the Employment Impact  Act, S. 1219. This bill will force Washington to look before it leaps when it  comes to regulation that could hurt  America\u2019s jobs. Under our bill, every  regulatory agency would be required to  prepare what is called a jobs impact  statement, and this jobs impact statement would need to be prepared with  every new rule that is proposed. The  statement would include a detailed assessment of the jobs that would be lost  or gained or sent overseas by any given  rule  coming out of Washington.  It  would  consider whether  new  rules  would have a bad impact on our job  market in general. This jobs impact  statement would also include an analysis  of  any  alternative  plans  that  might be better for the economy. Most  importantly,  it would  require  regulatory agencies to  look at how new  rules might interact with other proposals coming down the road.  The problem with our regulations is  not only that they are too sweeping, it  is also that there are too many of  them, so it makes no sense to look at  an individual rule in a vacuum and enacting hundreds of them without knowing their cumulative effect. The effect  of all of these together could spell  death by a thousand cuts  for hard-  working Americans who are trying to  work and support their families.  Also in keeping with the principles of  transparency, this bill would require  every jobs impact statement prepared  by a Federal agency to be made available to the public. The American people deserve to know what their government  is actually doing, and Federal  agencies in Washington need to learn  to think before they act.  Requiring  statements  from  these  agencies on what their regulations will  do is nothing new. For 40 years, the  Federal Government has always  required its bureaucrats to ask the question of whether their actions will impact  America\u2019s  environment.  They  have  to  file  environmental  impact  statements. What I am asking for here  is a jobs impact statement.  Past generations of legislators rightly recognized the importance of America\u2019s land, air, and water, but it is important that we recognize the importance of America\u2019s working families as  well. America\u2019s greatest natural  resource is the American people. We are  talking  about  people who want  to  work, are willing to work, are looking  for work, and yet cannot find a job.  The Employment Impact Act will force  Washington  bureaucrats  to  realize  Americans are much more interested in  growing our Nation\u2019s economy  than  they are in growing our government.  I am going to continue to fight to see  that the Employment Impact Act is  passed and signed into law to help get  Americans working again.  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  clerk will call the roll.  The  legislative clerk proceeded  call the roll.  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask  unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without  objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. THUNE. Madam President,  I  wish to echo the comments made by  my colleague from Wyoming regarding  regulations. That is something I hear  from small businesses all across South  Dakota, traveling my State during the  month of August. I toured businesses,  and I visited with farmers and ranchers  and small businesspeople. That was a  recurring theme, one thing people continued to bring up unsolicited. When  you asked them questions about what  can be done to help create jobs, to get  them investing and putting their capital  to work,  that was  the  overwhelming response. It came back literally every  single  time,  that businesses are concerned about the overreaching  regulations  coming out of  Washington, DC, and the economic uncertainty that it creates. Part of it just  has to do with the predictability that  businesses need to make long-term investment decisions.  If  they do not  know what is going to happen next in  Washington, DC, it makes it awfully  The  to  hard for them to plan. So as a consequence of that, we see billions of dollars, trillions of dollars, sitting on the  sidelines right now that could be invested and could be put to work, could  be getting people back to work in this  country.  Last week we all listened with great  interest as the President came out to a  joint session of Congress and made a  speech about a jobs plan. He talked  about passing this jobs plan. He has  been  traveling  around  the  country  making that same argument. What was  interesting to me about that proposal\u2014  and, of course, the speech itself was  sufficiently vague. It was very difficult  to know exactly what was in that proposal, where more of those details now  are coming to light. It sounded eerily  similar to the very same proposal we  voted on a couple of years ago in the  Senate. It ultimately became law. It  was called the stimulus bill. It had a  pricetag of nearly $1 trillion.  The assertions made at the time were  along the lines that if we passed this it  would keep unemployment below 8 percent. We know employment is over 9  percent, and since that stimulus bill  was passed we have lost 1.7 million jobs  in our economy. There are 1.7 million  fewer Americans employed today than  there were when  the  stimulus  bill  passed a couple of years ago. So the  question, then, is, Why would we want  to go down that same path?  In many respects this proposal is like  that one because it consists of more  spending and more taxing and more  borrowing\u2014all the things we believe  are detrimental to the economy in the  long run. They do nothing to address  the concern that was raised to me by  the small businesses across South Dakota and the issue to which the Senator from Wyoming was just speaking;  that is, the issue of overregulation that  we keep hearing from our businesses  across this country, the job creators in  our economy.  It strikes me, if the President is serious about actually doing  something  that would create jobs in this country,  it ought to involve putting policies in  place that will be conducive toward  long-term economic growth to provide  the  economic  certainty  these  small  businesses are asking for.  Right now there is uncertainty with  regard to taxes. Tax rates are at least  locked in now until the end of 2012, but  beyond  that  it  is anybody\u2019s guess.  There is a concern, of course, that any  proposal  coming out of Washington  right now that deals with deficit reduction might include higher taxes. That  certainly is something the President  put on the table yet again yesterday as  a proposed way to pay for his new stimulus bill.  There is this repeated and consistent  assault upon small businesses in the  form of more regulations. The President backed off of the ozone regulations, which is something that everybody reacted very favorably toward in  the business community and people I  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:56 Sep 14, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G13SE6.030 S13SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",

As a result, groups and organizations like the Drug Enforcement Administration,  the Office of National  Drug Control Policy, the Community  Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the  Consumer Healthcare Products Association,  and  the Partnership  for  a  Drug-Free America have been reaching  out  to communities  throughout  the  Nation to raise awareness of this growing drug abuse trend and encourage  communities  to  tackle  the problem  head on.

We can stop the growing trend of  medicine abuse in its tracks, but it will  require all sectors of the community to  join together to make it happen. The  National Medicine Abuse Awareness  Month resolution promotes the message  that over-the-counter and prescription medicines must be taken as  directed, and when used recreationally  or in large doses they can have serious  and deadly consequences. This resolution will help remind parents that access to drugs that are abused doesn\u2019t  just  happen  in  alleys  and  on  the  streets, but can often occur right in  the home.

L.C.,  527 U.S. 581 (1999), assert the right of an individual to live in the home and community of  the individual;  Whereas, in 2011, the majority of direct  support professionals are employed in home  and community-based settings and this trend  is projected to increase over the decade;  Whereas there is a documented critical and  growing shortage of direct support professionals in every community throughout the  United States; and  Whereas many direct support professionals  are forced to leave jobs due to inadequate  wages and benefits, creating high turnover  and  vacancy  rates  that  research  demonstrates adversely affects the quality of  supports  to  individuals with  disabilities:  Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the Senate\u2014  (1) designates  the week beginning September 11, 2011, as \u2018\u2018National Direct Support  Professionals Recognition Week\u2019\u2019;  (2) recognizes the dedication and vital role  of direct support professionals in enhancing  the lives of individuals with disabilities of  all ages;  (3) appreciates the contribution of direct  support professionals in supporting the needs  that reach beyond the capacities of millions  of families in the United States;  (4) commends direct support professionals  as integral in supporting the long-term support and  services  system of  the United  States; and  (5) finds that the successful implementation of the public policies of the United  States depends on the dedication of direct  support professionals.  f  SENATE RESOLUTION  264\u2014DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 12, 2011, AS  \u2018\u2018NATIONAL DAY OF ENCOURAGEMENT\u2019\u2019  Mr. PRYOR  (for himself and Mr.  BOOZMAN) submitted the following resolution; which was  considered  and  agreed to:  S.

            "124": "September 13, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014Extensions of Remarks E1609  As a senior Member of both the Judiciary  and Homeland Security committees,  I have  worked tirelessly to ensure the safety and integrity of those who are members of the judiciary. The Ethics  in Government Act requires  judges, like Members of Congress and other  high ranking public officials  to  file annual  financial disclosure  reports. This  requirement  serves to bolster the confidence of the public  in the professional integrity of individuals who  serve their community.  Although the intent of the Act is to bolster  public confidence in the judiciary it has an unintended consequence  inherent  in  full public  disclosure. Full  financial disclosure  impacts  the personal safety of judges, particularly the  safety  of  judges who  sentence  criminals.  Some of the information contained in financial  disclosure  reports  could  reveal  information  which pertains to the schools, workplaces, and  homes of judges and their families. This type  of  information provides easy access  to personal information that could be used by an individual to intimidate or harm a judge or her  family. In order to mitigate these risks, section  7 of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 allows  the Judicial Conference to redact information found in financial  disclosures that would place a judge or their  family at risk.  This legislation does not exempt judicial employees and judges from filing financial disclosures. The Judicial Conference\u2019s Committee  on Financial Disclosures works in coordination  with the U.S. Marshals Service to determine  the merit of requests for redaction. The Judicial conference reports that between 2007 and  2010, of  the 17,658  financial disclosure  reports filed, there were only 750 redaction requests, or 4.2 percent of  the  reports  filed.  There were 645 redaction requests that were  fully granted, and 70 that were partially granted.  This  legislation protects  judges and  their  families from those that may seek to harm or  intimidate the judge. The majority of redaction  requests that were approved contained information that indicated the whereabouts of the  filer\u2019s family on a regular basis, or the residence at which the filing party lived. H.R. 1059  does not exempt anyone from fulfilling their requirement to file a financial disclosure.  In the 110th Congress, my colleagues and  I extended the authorizing section of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act  twice  to ensure continued protection of our  judges and their families. The last extension  will expire on December 31, 2011,  leaving  thousands of dedicated public servants and  their loved ones vulnerable to harm or harassment.  I applaud my  friend  from Michigan,  the  Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee  for introducing this important legislation to protect judges and judicial employees. I urge my  colleagues to lend their support to the bill.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. GLENN THOMPSON  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 13, 2011  Mr.  THOMPSON  of  Pennsylvania. Mr.  Speaker, I was not in attendance on Friday,  September 9, 2011, due to catastrophic flooding in Pennsylvania\u2019s Fifth Congressional District. My presence was needed at home, on  the  ground, with my  constituents,  first-responders, and recovery teams. While back in  Pennsylvania,  I met with  local officials and  constituents to help assist in disaster recovery  efforts. I also toured many of the town\u2019s in the  5th District of Pennsylvania that were most affected by the floods. Consequently, I missed  the vote on the Carney Amendment to H.R.  1892,  the  Intelligence Authorization Act  for  Fiscal Year, 2012.  Had I been present for rollcall vote number  696, my vote on Amendment #7, offered by  Mr. Carney of Delaware, to H.R. 1892 would  have been \u2018\u2018yes.\u2019\u2019  f  CELEBRATING THE SERVICE OF  LINDA S. ADAMS  HON. JIM COSTA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 13, 2011  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  congratulate Ms. Linda S. Adams on the occasion of her retirement as the State of California\u2019s Secretary  for Environmental Protection.  More than thirty years of service to California  and its residents make her most deserving of  this honor.  Linda was appointed as Secretary of  the  California Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA)  in  2006,  by  Governor  Arnold  Schwarzenegger. Her appointment was historical, as she was the first woman to ever be  appointed to this position. As California\u2019s EPA  Secretary, Linda had a number of responsibilities which helped ensure the well-being of the  people of California. During her time as secretary, Linda oversaw the activities of the Air  Resources Board, State Water Resources  Control Board, Office of Environmental Health  Hazard Assessment, Department  of  Toxic  Substances Control, Department of Pesticide  Regulation, and approximately 5,000 employees.  Upon her appointment, Linda began to do  innovative work  to address climate change  and global warming. She was selected by  Governor Schwarzenegger as the lead negotiator on Assembly Bill 32, the Global Warming  Solutions Act of 2006. She was instrumental in  launching  the Green  Chemistry  Initiative,  which calls for a more comprehensive look at  California\u2019s chemical policies, as well as California\u2019s biomonitoring program which seeks to  find links between environmental contaminants  and human health. She has since continued to  work closely with a number of states and  countries  to  develop  climate  initiatives  to  achieve the greatest global reductions.  Before her service as Secretary of California\u2019s EPA, Linda functioned as the director of  the California Department of Water Resources  and as a member of Governor Gray Davis\u2019  staff. Prior to becoming a member of Governor  Davis\u2019 staff, Linda served Californians for 20  years as a staff member  for  the California  State Legislature. Of note was her  time as  chief consultant to the Senate Committee on  Agriculture and Water Resources. During her  time as a legislative staffer, she worked diligently on assisting the passage of Proposition  204, the Safe, Clean, Reliable Water Supply  Act.  Linda has spent her life working on behalf of  the people of California and has been a longtime friend of California\u2019s Central Valley. She  has worked on several air quality  issues\u2014a  deeply important issue to the Central Valley,  and most recently served as a member of the  Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control  Board.  I applaud Linda for her many years of diligent work on behalf of all of  the people of  California and the Central Valley. I invite my  colleagues to join me in congratulating Linda  on her retirement and thanking her for her innovative approach to enriching the lives of all  Californians.  f  IN MEMORY OF JUDGE FRANK  SCROGGINS  HON. MIKE ROSS  OFARKANSAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 13, 2011  Mr. ROSS of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor a true, dedicated public servant  who left us much too soon. On Saturday, August 28, 2011, Frank Scroggins, county judge  for Lafayette County, Arkansas, died unexpectedly at the too-young age of 62.  Throughout my  term  in Congress,  I have  had  the distinct pleasure of working with  Judge Scroggins and I have long admired and  respected him. He was a very good friend.  The people of Lafayette County first elected  Judge Scroggins of Stamps, Ark., in 1991 and  he had served as county judge ever since. For  20 years, Judge Scroggins gave his all and  fully embodied what it meant to be a public  servant.  Judge Scroggins was so much a part of his  community  that, upon his passing, a newspaper proclaimed Lafayette County government had \u2018\u2018lost its cornerstone.\u2019\u2019 Indeed, there  is a deep absence in the heart of south Arkansas.  Judge Scroggins always worked  tirelessly  on behalf of the people of Lafayette County,  never losing sight of what he was elected to  do. From city council to the quorum court to  the U.S. Congress, anyone who had the privilege of working with Judge Scroggins can attest  to  the sincerity, honesty and  ferocity  in  which he served as county judge.  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife of  42 years, Brenda, and the rest of his family  and friends during this very difficult time.  Today,  I ask all Members of Congress  to  join me as we honor  the  life and  legacy of  Judge Frank Scroggins, who will be deeply  missed  in Lafayette County and  throughout  the state of Arkansas.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

KEATING  OFMASSACHUSETTS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 13, 2011  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the seventy-fifth anniversary of the  Cape Cod Times, a daily newspaper circulated  throughout the towns and villages of Massachusetts\u2019 Cape and Islands.  Seventy-five years ago, businessmen J.P.  Dunn and Basil Brewer came  together  in a  Hyannis garage  to publish  the Cape Cod  Standard-Times. This union grew out of  the  men\u2019s desire to provide the residents of the  Cape and Islands with access to community  news, so they teamed up with the New Bedford  Standard-Times  for  joint  distribution  through  the 1960s. By 1970, however,  the  success of local small businesses and industries had brought an era of expansion to the  region, augmenting the need for a local paper  to service  the needs and  interests of  the  unique communities of the Cape and Islands.  In 1975, the first Cape Cod Times edition was  published  as  an  \u2018\u2018independent Cape Cod  newspaper,  printed  and  published  on  the  Cape, by Cape Codders, for Cape Codders.\u2019\u2019  Today, the Cape Cod Times provides over  60,000 readers in the region with daily headlines of national and  local  relevance\u2014from  summer beach  closings  to breaking news  across  the  globe. The  paper\u2019s  circulation  reaches beyond the Cape and Islands through  its online subscription, allowing readers to stay  up-to-date on community happenings no matter their location.  Time and time again, the paper has been  recognized for its national significance, having  been named  to such prestigious awards as  \u2018\u2018Newspaper of  the Year,\u2019\u2019  \u2018\u2018Website of  the  Year\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Sunday Newspaper of the Year\u2019\u2019  by  the New England Press Association,  the  New England Newspaper Association, and the  New England Associated Press Executives  Association.  Having owned a home on Cape Cod  for  twenty years, it is with pride and gratitude that  I congratulate the Cape Cod Times, its editors  and staff on providing seventy-five years of  authentic journalism to the people of the Tenth  Congressional District of Massachusetts. I extend my best wishes to the paper for many  more years of award-winning  journalism  to  come.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 13, 2011  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor the Chester Library located in  Morris County, New Jersey, as it celebrates its  100th anniversary this year.  The Chester Library officially opened on  Labor Day  in 1911 as a  joint  library of  the  Chesters. The  library originally occupied a  very small space above a metal shoe-support  factory and was only open for selected hours  on Saturdays. Due to difficulty attaining funding, it constantly moved from one location to  another until  it  finally settled  in  its current  home in 1981.  The library expanded in 2004 with the addition of a Children\u2019s Room and a public meeting room. The new room not only provided  extra meeting space for the library, but it is  also available for local non-profits to use.  With a collection of over 70,000 books,  music CDs,  audio  books, movies,  video  games, e-books and periodicals, the Chester  Library has come a long way from its modest  start with merely 138 books. Available for borrowing are books, magazines, audio books,  DVDs, video tapes, CDs, video games, puppets and puzzles. Residents of Chester Borough and Chester Township, as well as any  person with a Morris Automated  Information  Network (M.A.I.N.) card, are free to search the  shelves and take advantage of all the library  has to offer.  With more than 300 programs for visitors,  there is something for everyone. From story  time for children to book discussions with the  Young Adult Club and Computer Education for  seniors, the Chester Library is a rich resource  for the community. The library has 12 public  computers with free Internet that provide visitors with convenient access to the Internet and  other databases.  The Chester Library serves a vital role  in  the community. Not only does it provide access to numerous books, collections and databases, but the library also offers the people of  Chester with a social community where everyone is welcome to share and enjoy.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues  to  join me  in congratulating  the Chester Library as  they celebrate 100 years of supporting access to knowledge and information  in the local community.  f  OUR UNCONSCIONABLE NATIONAL  DEBT  HON.

            "12": "H6428  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE September 23, 2011  the American Lung Association and  countless  other  organizations  that  favor the Clean Air Act and are opposed to delaying further two particularly important measures that would  allow for pollution to continue to be  cleaned up.  Port Everglades in Florida, right outside my constituency,  for all of the  years that I have lived there\u2014and that  nears 50\u2014this coal-powered plant has  been producing  emissions. Over  the  course of time, they have reduced those  emissions. And Florida Power & Light  recently indicated that they\u2019re going  to do everything that they can to meet  the emissions standards rather than sit  up and try and oppose them because  they recognize, one, that they do have  all of the juice\u2014if you can call electricity that.  And in the final analysis, those of us  that benefit from it are going to wind  up paying more. But to pay more to  make sure that children don\u2019t have  asthma and to make sure that people  don\u2019t have lung pollution and to make  sure that lakes don\u2019t go dead from mercury or that fish don\u2019t have in them  more mercury than they rightly should  for food consumption, then I\u2019m willing  to pay more; and I believe most Americans are as well in order that we will  have clean air.  I ask for support of my amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the  gentleman has expired.  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Chairman,  rise in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman  from Kentucky is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. WHITFIELD. I have great admiration for the gentleman from Florida,  who is always eloquent in his remarks.  b1030  He  started off his  support of his  amendment by saying that we are trying  to dismantle any  regulation.  I  would like to remind everyone, once  again, that this bill applies to 14 EPA  regulations and we do not delay in any  way 12 of them. And on the other two,  we delay one of them, both of them, 6  months after the final report is due.  Now, he had mentioned that Exelon  supported the new EPA regulations.  Exelon is a company that we all admire  and respect, but it\u2019s a nuclear energy  company, so there\u2019s nothing in these  regulations that has any  impact on  them, as far as I know. But all of these  regulations are trying to drive the coal  industry out of business, that still provides 50 percent of all the electricity in  America.  Now, in the TRAIN Act, we simply  ask this independent government agency, composed of Obama administration  appointees, to examine the cumulative  impact of all of these rules, because  EPA has never been quite this aggressive. And I might add that the two  rules that we asked to delay for further  analysis,  an  independent  research  group said that the annualized cost  would be almost $18 billion that utiliI  ties would have to spend to buy equipment that may not be able to even  then achieve the standards because the  technology is not available.  The issue is not about mercury. The  utilities do a great job of cleaning up  mercury. EPA itself said that its Utility MACT would only benefit\u2014the benefit of the Utility MACT would be only  .004 percent attributable to mercury  because 99 percent of mercury in America comes from nature and from outside other countries  that  the  trade  winds bring in to our country. So utilities don\u2019t object to the mercury part of  this.  But they\u2019re now adding hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride, of which  there  is no  technology available  to  achieve the standard that EPA is setting.  So because of the cost, because of the  unique vulnerability of our economy  today, 12 of these regulations we don\u2019t  delay at all. We just say, let\u2019s study  the  cumulative  impact, which  the  President asked for in his Executive  order that he issued recently. He said  we need to look at the cumulative impact. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.  This amendment would basically say,  you don\u2019t look at the cumulative impact, you just take the existing studies  that have been made. I would also say  that EPA didn\u2019t even do any study on  the greenhouse gas, which we\u2019re only  trying to analyze the full cost of that.  For those reasons, I would respectfully oppose the gentleman\u2019s amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is  on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.  Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  The Acting  CHAIR. Pursuant  to  clause 6 of rule XVIII,  further proceedings on the amendment offered by  the gentleman  from Florida will be  postponed.  AMENDMENTNO. 8OFFEREDBYMR. CONNOLLY  OFVIRGINIA  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order  to consider amendment No. 8 printed in  House Report 112\u2013213.  Mr. CONNOLLY  of Virginia. Mr.  Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will  designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  Page 10, after line 24, insert the following:  (g) ADDITIONALANALYSES.\u2014The Committee  shall conduct or commission studies to identify pollution control policies that should be  adopted and  implemented by  the United  States to provide domestic job growth and  ensure that the Nation  is  internationally  competitive in the $5 trillion global energy  industry for clean energy technology development and manufacturing.  The Acting  CHAIR. Pursuant  to  House Resolution 406, the gentleman  from Virginia  (Mr. CONNOLLY) and a  Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Virginia.  Mr. CONNOLLY  of Virginia. Mr.  Chairman, Deutsche Bank, the biggest  bank in Europe, recently issued a report on global clean energy investment  opportunities  in  which  it  stated,  \u2018\u2018Countries with more TLC,  transparency, longevity, and certainty, in  their climate policy frameworks will  attract more investment and build new  clean industries, technologies, and jobs  faster than their policy-lagging counterparts.\u2019\u2019  The TRAIN Act is one more step in  the wrong direction by the same Republican House which has held over 110  anti-environmental votes. This unprecedented assault on  the environment  has devastating consequences for our  economy. As the Deutsche Bank report  said,  \u2018\u2018Germany  and  China  have  emerged as global leaders in low carbon technologies and investment. The  net effect is that while Congress stumbles, the U.S. stands to fall behind.\u2019\u2019  This investor report, from Europe\u2019s  largest bank, identified several policy  failures that are impeding job growth  here at home. First, Congress has not  established a carbon reduction target,  or required polluters to pay  for the  cost of greenhouse gas pollution. Congress does not have a national renewable standard or even an energy efficient standard. The Deutsche Bank report notes that the lack of these regulations  and  incentives has  actually  forced investors to make investments  elsewhere, including in China and other  countries, rather than here at home in  America. As a result, we have  lost  solar and other advanced technology  market share to our competitors.  My simple amendment to the TRAIN  Act establishes a  simple process  to  identify \u2018\u2018policies that should be adopted and  implemented by  the United  States to provide domestic job growth,  and to ensure that our Nation is internationally competitive in the $5 trillion global energy industry for clean  energy technology, development, and  manufacturing.\u2019\u2019 Business leaders have  urged Congress to adopt both a regulatory framework and a system of incentives to spur clean energy job creation. In addition to the regulation the  Deutsche Bank identified as supporting  investment, American  entrepreneurs  have called on Congress to expand public financing for clean energy.  This month members of the American Energy Innovation Council visited  Capitol Hill to express their strong  support  for  just  that concept. This  group included venture capitalist John  Doerr,  former Lockheed Martin CEO  Norm Augustine, and Bill Gates of  Microsoft. The American Energy Innovation Council recently issued a report  which stated, \u2018\u2018As business leaders, we  feel that America\u2019s current energy system is deficient in ways that cause serious harm to our economy, our national security, and our environment.

            "20": "H6436  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE September 23, 2011  Mr. TERRY. I believe that the gentlelady from California\u2019s amendment is  heartfelt and sincere to the DERA program but irresponsible as it\u2019s produced  here today. There are costs associated  with the EPA going forward with the  studies that we are requesting of them.  Under our rules of the House, there\u2019s  PAYGO rules. We must offset those  costs. This is one of those tough decisions made to offset the costs. So the  first line of irresponsibility would be it  will add to the deficit but for this offset.  b1120  The second  line of  irresponsibility  would be, well, it may feel responsible.  And this really is a poison pill because  if the offset is eliminated, they get to  kill the whole bill because of that. So  it\u2019s not as innocent an amendment as  it is portrayed on the surface. The real  issue of  this bill  in  entirety must  stand.  As previous speakers have said, Mr.  Chairman, and rightfully so, the EPA  is a rogue agency. They are producing  rules in a fast and furious manner that  greatly affects this Nation\u2019s ability to  generate  electricity. This  bill  just  wraps three of them together and says,  take a step back and do a cost analysis,  as the President has asked of agencies.  This agency, though, as headed by Ms.  Jackson, has said to us in our committee that she will not be beholding  or follow the President\u2019s own executive  order to look at the cost benefit analysis. They say, as we have heard here  today, their modeling says that they  can reduce asthma so, therefore, no  cost benefit analysis.  But there are real effects that I\u2019m  concerned with here, and the reason  why I do believe this needs to be studied before implemented is we need to  slow down the EPA and Lisa Jackson  and their attempts to do a cap program  without Congress\u2019 involvement or approval. They couldn\u2019t get it done legislatively, so she\u2019s doing it by rule and  edict from the EPA.  This rule will add significant costs to  the ability of small generators to generate electricity, which will force them  to shut down without any path forward  to replace that. In fact, they haven\u2019t  even done a study on reliability to determine if electricity can be wheeled  into the areas that the plants will have  to shut down.  In fact, there are two plants near my  district in Nebraska: Grand Island and  Fremont. Grand Island is saying that  these rules of the EPA are fast and furious and without any cost benefit  analysis will  force the Grand Island  plant to close. How will they get their  electricity? They will have to find a  creative way to do it; yet there\u2019s been  no study on reliability. Secondly, in  Fremont, Nebraska,  they  say what  they\u2019ll do  is  just  lower their plant  level, just do a minimum amount of  electricity. Where are they going to  make that up?  This is a directive. This is part of the  radical environmentalist agenda being  placed on America by one agency and  one person, Lisa Jackson. We need to  slow this down and take a hard look at  it.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Chairman, I  find it interesting that the gentleman  would say that this might be irresponsible. What I heard of the comments  was I didn\u2019t talk about the legislation  within itself. We\u2019re talking about the  amendment of how this is going to be  paid for. And so the question before the  House is going to be, is it appropriate  to take additional funds to use DERA  as the whipping boy time and time  again  for a program that  is helping  what my colleague from the other side  is saying?  I would actually say that DERA is responsible. What\u2019s irresponsible is continuing to put the health of Americans  in jeopardy. I will repeat the quote for  my colleagues from the chairman of  the Interior, Environment and Related  Agencies, Mr. SIMPSON. He called the  cuts to DERA \u2018\u2018the wrong choice.\u2019\u2019 We  have  already  been  responsible,  and  DERA has already paid its fair share,  and it\u2019s being cut as other programs  have been cut. The question is, is it  right to continue to deplete this program?  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. TERRY. Mr. Chairman, I think  it\u2019s interesting that she didn\u2019t refute  the point that if the PAYGO is eliminated, hers passes, they raise a point of  order and kill the bill, which is the real  impetus behind this amendment.  Ms. RICHARDSON. Will  the  tleman yield?  Mr. TERRY. No.  I  think  it\u2019s  also  interesting\u2014you  have the right to close\u2014that the President\u2019s budget, for which there was no  pushback by  this other  side of  the  aisle, zeroed it out. Ours didn\u2019t. We\u2019re  just cutting it by $4 million, and it\u2019s a  tough choice. We agree.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Chairman, in  closing, I would say, I think I\u2019ve said  twice now, the issue that we have before us is the question of this amendment whether DERA is the appropriate  funding source that would be considered for the offset. That\u2019s the question  that we have before us.  It\u2019s interesting that Mr. WHITFIELD  himself has benefited  from this program. In Kentucky, the construction  ports utilized $1.16 million to retrofit  73  pieces  of  nonroad  construction  equipment. Also, the Kentucky Association General Contractors benefited  from retrofitting 87 pieces of equipment. I would say to you it\u2019s irresponsible to have the American public driving on our highways and roads and  going through our airports breathing  this air.  What I\u2019ve reached out to the other  side is that it\u2019s important. We\u2019re talking about EPA regulations. Why would  we reduce funding of a program that  helps companies to meet the regulations?  It\u2019s  counterintuitive  and  it  doesn\u2019t make sense.  genI urge my colleagues to vote \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019  for  the Richardson amendment; and  the Richardson amendment is intended  for exactly that, to eliminate cutting  this program.

            "36": "H6452  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE September 23, 2011  should get to a system that way. But  we\u2019re on the way. We see it happening  more and more.  We dangle money out to States and  local government through grants. You  want to keep getting the grants? Do  what we tell you. The Founders never  intended  that. Never  intended  that.  Bad enough that we set up a system  where we order unfunded mandates of  State governments. Before  the  17th  amendment  things weren\u2019t  perfect.  They did need fixing, so I\u2019m not advocating complete repeal.  But there has got to be a way to restore power back to the States that it  lost when State legislatures could no  longer select the U.S. Senators. And  I\u2019m aware,  there were  some abuses  there, but we have got to get a veto  power,  some  leverage  back  to  the  States again so the Federal Government doesn\u2019t keep doing the kind of  thing that this President throws out in  his bill.  And, of course, more and more of the  airwaves  are  being moved  toward  broadband. So at page 75, something  that tells you a lot about where this  President wants to go for the future, he  has the establishment of the Public  Safety Broadband Corporation. But not  to worry, page 76 points out this establishes a private, nonprofit corporation  to be known as the  \u2018\u2018Public Safety  Broadband Corporation.\u2019\u2019 It says, and  I\u2019m quoting, \u2018\u2018which is neither an agency nor establishment of the U.S. Government or the District of Columbia.\u2019\u2019  But they will control broadband. So  anyone  that might have  broadband  coming in, maybe get television, computer,  Internet,  radio  through  broadband, well, guess who comes into  your home or place of business through  your broadband? It\u2019s control of the new  Public Safety Broadband Corporation.  In  1984  there was  that  eye  that  looked out into every room from something hanging on the wall. It was Big  Brother  watching  everything.  How  comforting  to know  this President  wants Big Brother watching us through  our computer, watching us through the  means of broadband.  But if you\u2019re worried, well, it says,  this will not be, and I\u2019m quoting, \u2018\u2018neither an agency nor establishment of  the United States Government or the  District of Columbia.\u2019\u2019 That\u2019s great  news.  So who will be controlling this new  Public Safety Broadband Corporation?  We see that in the next section a little  further down in page 76.  \u2018\u2018The following individuals, or their  respective  designees,  shall  serve  as  Federal members.\u2019\u2019 These are the people that will control the Public Safety  Broadband Corporation that this administration wants to impose and inflict  upon America,  controlling  all  broadband.  b1410  You have  the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General of the  United States, and the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget.  That\u2019s comforting, very comforting.  There will be non-Federal members  so they don\u2019t have just a total monopoly on control. In fact, there will be\u2014  the  next  section  says\u2014non-Federal  members  on  the  board. Well, who  might they be? The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the  Attorney General, shall appoint 11 individuals to serve as non-Federal members of the board.  Isn\u2019t  that  comforting. You\u2019ve got  Cabinet members  appointed  by  the  President\u2014but don\u2019t worry. The President won\u2019t control all of it, although  his  appointees  appoint  the  rest  of  them, and they\u2019re going to control the  broadband.  I think this is what America can expect when you have the President push  forward a bill that, until I filed my  American  Jobs Act,  there was  no  American Jobs Act down here in the  House; and that\u2019s where it had to be  filed because the Constitution requires  all revenue-raising bills to begin here  in the House. They have to originate  here.  So great news. I mean, boy, if the  President has his way, more and more  Federal control. Infrastructure. If you  need  infrastructure, well,  isn\u2019t  that  rosy. You can go begging to the Federal Government someday.  But it\u2019s at page 133, as I\u2019m moving  through this bill, that you find section  376: Federal and State Immunity. But  it doesn\u2019t address Federal immunity at  all. It doesn\u2019t even touch Federal immunity. It, in fact, says, \u2018\u2018A State shall  not be immune under the 11th Amendment of the Constitution from a suit  brought  in a Federal court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of  this act.\u2019\u2019  We  don\u2019t have  the  constitutional  power to waive sovereign immunity for  the State. This is an incredible overreach by the President taking away the  sovereign immunity of a State not to  be sued. He proposes a bill, and says,  Not only am I proposing this bill, but  I\u2019m going to stick in a provision\u2014it\u2019s  here on page 133\u2014that says, States,  you can be sued if you don\u2019t follow my  law\u2014my bill\u2014to the T.  How could the Federal Government  waive States\u2019 sovereign  immunity? I  can tell you. Under constitutional law,  the Federal Government cannot waive  States\u2019  sovereign  immunity. Only a  State can waive its sovereign immunity. The Federal Government cannot  have anyone waive its sovereign immunity.  Sovereign  immunity  is  only  waived for the Federal Government if  the Federal Government decides  to  waive it.  So how can the President stick in a  bill that allows States to be sued willy-  nilly under this bill? It\u2019s in the next  provision.  \u2018\u2018A State\u2019s receipt or use of Federal  financial assistance for any program or  activity of a State shall constitute a  waiver of sovereign  immunity under  the 11th Amendment to the Constitution, or otherwise, to a suit brought by  an employee or applicant for employment.\u2019\u2019  He recognizes constitutional law. The  Federal Government cannot waive sovereign immunity for a State, but the  President says, You know what? If you  receive one dime from the Federal Government for any program, then that is  an affirmative waiver of your right not  to be sued under some bill that we  make up here in my czar capital in  Washington.  We also heard about going after the  millionaires and billionaires. Now, as  people have been told over and over,  the CBO\u2014the Congressional Budget Office\u2014that scores bills cannot score a  speech unless, of course, the Director  gets called to the White House and gets  intimidated, and  then perhaps  they  will. But in the meantime, generally,  you cannot score a speech. There has  got to be a bill. So it doesn\u2019t matter  what a President says in a speech in  this body or if he spends millions and  millions and millions of dollars running around the country telling people  to pass a bill that for so long did not  exist here in the House. What matters  is what\u2019s in a bill.  So the President says he\u2019s going after  millionaires and billionaires, but if you  look at page 134 and page 135, you\u2019ll  find out what  the President  really  thinks constitutes a millionaire or a  billionaire. At the bottom of page 134,  it\u2019s subtitled, \u2018\u2018A 28 percent limitation  on certain deductions and exclusions.\u2019\u2019  So who  loses deductions? Who  is  going to get punished for making too  much money? How many millions do  you have to have before this President  wants you punished and taxed extra?  What does this President consider to be  a millionaire or a billionaire who\u2019s not  paying their fair share and who should  pay more?  It\u2019s  in black and white now. The  President\u2019s bill says that it applies to  the taxpayer whose adjusted gross income is above $125,000 if you\u2019re married, filing separately.  So, under the President\u2019s definition  of who\u2019s a millionaire and billionaire  who\u2019s not paying their fair share and  who needs to pay a lot more, it\u2019s defined here in black and white as a married  person  filing  separately  who  makes more than $125,000. That\u2019s in the  President\u2019s bill. If you\u2019re married filing  jointly, then you get to be exempted  unless you make over $250,000 jointly  as a couple. Well, with $250,000 as a  couple and $125,000 as an individual, it\u2019s  still $125,000.  So how about if you\u2019re single and  you\u2019re not married? Well, good news  there. You can have either a $200,000  exemption or a $225,000 exemption if  you\u2019re single and head of the household. So it\u2019s potentially worth $100,000  to get divorced. The government is saying we\u2019ll give you an extra $75,000 to  $100,000 exemption if you\u2019ll just get divorced and live together.

Reserving  the  right to object and with the indulgence  of my friend the majority leader, let  me make some brief remarks about  where we are.  For anyone who  is confused about  what is going on in Congress right now,  let me make it easy. In order to keep  the government running beyond next  week, Congress needs to pass a short-  term bill that funds government operations at a spending  level to which  both parties can agree. The good news  is, we have already agreed on a spending level. That has already been done.  Last night, the House of Representatives passed a bill that meets that figure we agreed on a couple of months  ago.  Here is the holdup. Because of some  of the horrible weather we have had  over the past several weeks, we have  all agreed to add emergency funds we  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:36 Jun 03, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\SEPT\\S23SE1.REC S23SE1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",

We have brought this to all levels of  our government. This Senator, who  represents  the  State  Christine  Levinson lives in, went to the Iranian  Ambassador  at  the United Nations  years ago trying to intervene. Our Secretary of State has, in fact, pushed this  very hard.  Why am I saying all this? Because on  the occasion of  the  release of  the  hikers by the Iranian Government, for  whatever  compassion  they  have  shown\u2014the government bringing  together disparate parties that had their  own little power centers in Iran\u2014whatever success they had in bringing that  together and  releasing  those hikers  back to their loved ones, we pray that  same  decisionmaking  apparatus  in  Tehran would now activate the process  to bring Bob Levinson home to his wife  and seven children.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first of  all, I say to my good friend from Florida, I thank him so much for the compassion he has. I appreciate very much  him bringing this issue to our light and  to the attention of all of us, and maybe  we can help. I thank the Senator.  To my good friend, the Senator from  Louisiana,  I think what she speaks  about is us identifying who we are as  Americans and the way we have taken  care of each other. I do not know of  any State that has not had to depend  on FEMA for help\u2014and not just the  States she showed where  \u2018\u2018hurricane  alley\u2019\u2019 is and where the tornadoes and  hurricanes have hit, but basically all of  us have had to depend on FEMA for assistance. So I think what she brings to  light is the fairness we identify with as  Americans and to do what we have always done: to take care of each other.  I, for one, have said we need to rebuild  America; we need to take care of Americans first.  f  FISCAL CHOICES  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise  today to speak about the difficult fiscal choices we, as Members of Congress, must soon make and the deficit-  cutting  proposals  that  President  Obama has recently made.  As we discuss these  fiscal choices,  and as we face our exploding debts and  deficits, it is clear our Nation is truly  at a crossroads. A nation that was built  on the strength of our people\u2019s optimism must struggle to overcome a loss  of confidence\u2014a loss of confidence that  comes from an economy that has struggled for far too long, a loss of confidence that comes from watching debt  and deficits explode, a  loss of confidence that comes from watching Republicans and Democrats engage in a  fruitless partisan fight.  The American people worry about  how to get their families out of debt  and  their  financial house  in order.  They worry about finding or keeping a  job. They worry about how they are  going to pay the rent, how they are  going to take care of their children,  how they are going to keep clothes on  their backs, and how, maybe, they can  buy them a Christmas present.  Once again, instead of all of us coming together to do what is right for the  Nation and lighten their worries, congressional Republicans and Democrats  alike, and  the President, are again  gearing up for a fight about politics,  even as our Nation\u2019s fiscal and economic picture gets worse every minute.  Today, we yet again find ourselves on  the brink, and I cannot begin to explain why to the American people. This  summer, they watched us go through  this exercise\u2014the Senate, the House,  and the President\u2014and then we agreed  on spending cuts to keep the government working. Where I come from\u2014the  same as the Presiding Officer from the  great State of Minnesota\u2014your word is  your bond, and an agreement  is an  agreement, and it is one that should be  kept. It is one we negotiated. It should  not be changed  in midstream. I am  committed to passing a clean CR to  keep our government working until the  supercommittee we all are supporting  comes up with the recommendations to  reduce the deficit.  In the midst of yet another disagreement over whether to keep the government running, the people of West Virginia and the American people are demanding we  put  our  partisan  differences aside and work together in the  best interests of this country. They are  pleading  for us to quit  fighting and  worrying about the next election and  start worrying about the next generation.  With our Nation facing a death spiral  of debt, now is the time that each of us  should be zeroing in on credible, commonsense solutions that have truly bipartisan support.  After carefully reviewing the President\u2019s  recommendations  to  the  so-  called supercommittee, I believe they  fall short of what this country needs to  put our fiscal house in order. President  Obama\u2019s deficit recommendations not  only fall short of his stated $4.4 trillion  goal, but could, according to an analysis done by the Center for Responsible  Federal Budget, have the perverse effect of adding as much as $1.9 trillion  to our Nation\u2019s debt.  I am also greatly concerned about rehashing  unproductive  recommendations such as raising tax rates on small  businesses in a recession and budget  gimmicks such as the notion that taxpayers will somehow \u2018\u2018save\u2019\u2019 $1.1 trillion from not fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq\u2014and I believe we should  not be there anyway.  I have said this: On my best day, I  cannot sell that to the people of West  Virginia, nor should we try to sell it to  the American people.  That is not to say that the President\u2019s proposal  is all bad. There  is  some good stuff in there. I have long  said our tax system needs to be more  fair and balanced and that billionaires  such as Mr. Buffett should pay their  fair share. I appreciate the concept of  the Buffett rule and look forward to  seeing more details. And I agree that  one of the best  investments we all  could make is in the infrastructure of  this great country.  But as they stand right now, President Obama\u2019s proposals are too skewed  to appeal to both sides of the aisle. So  we see what we see happening again. If  we are being serious about addressing  our debt and deficits, neither Republicans nor Democrats can propose partisan proposals and then pretend they  are credible. We cannot do that any  longer. The American people deserve  better, and I also know we can do a lot  better.  In my short time in Congress, I have  seen only one plan that has earned support from Members of both parties. In  fact,  the President\u2019s own bipartisan  deficit commission\u2014the Bowles-Simpson group\u2014is the best example of what  can be accomplished if we put politics  aside and do what is right for our Nation. While no one, including me, will  agree with everything in the Bowles-  Simpson approach, it at least offered a  commonsense,  bipartisan  template  that would cut spending, restore tax  fairness, and would help restore fiscal  sanity to our Nation.  To date, it is the only plan that has  offered a framework that has had bipartisan support from the beginning,  and still has it now. But instead of this  approach, there are many people on  both sides of the aisle who have chosen  a path that all but guarantees that Republicans and Democrats will continue  to fight over how to solve our fiscal  problems, instead of seeking common  ground  and  commonsense  solutions.  For the sake of our Nation, for our  families, we cannot let this happen. We  must act, and we must act together.  Looking ahead to the vigorous debates of the fall, my hope is the deficit  supercommittee will seize the moment  and seek common ground to develop a  plan that puts our Nation on the right  path to fiscal accountability. Common  sense, to me, is that you would start  with a plan that already has bipartisan  support because it will take both sides  of the aisle to fix this problem.  I urge them and the President to  look beyond partisan politics and do  what is right for this country. I continue to urge the committee to look  past their legal mandate of $1.5 trillion  in savings and revenue and, instead,  look for reforms that will create much  broader  fairness  in our system that  will  lead to deficit reductions of at  least $4 trillion.  I, for one, will work with the Senate  Democrats and Republicans who are  committed to develop a commonsense  debt fix that responsibly reduces spending; makes our tax system more fair,  cuts waste,  fraud,  and  abuse,  and  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:36 Jun 03, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\SEPT\\S23SE1.REC S23SE1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",
            "60": "S5938  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE September 23, 2011  older brothers and sister were raised in a loving home by parents that worked very hard  to provide for their children. Rennie, as he  was affectionately known, grew up like most  of us. He had many friends, loved playing  basketball, just a normal childhood growing  up. He is described by his sister Lelia as  \u2018\u2018just a charming little boy.\u2019\u2019  Rennie attended  school at  the Lincoln  School in Middlesboro, long since gone. In  the days of segregation,  it was the only  school in Middlesboro for black children. He  was a good student, very popular among his  classmates  and known  for his  sense  of  humor. Bill Smith, a longtime friend of the  Gayles family, described Rennie as \u2018\u2018a solid  guy with a good head on his shoulders.\u2019\u2019  Rennie was also a very talented athlete  who played football, baseball, and was an especially gifted basketball player. With the  end  of  segregation,  he  then  attended  Middlesboro High School, where he graduated in 1964.  Offered a scholarship by Knoxville College  to play basketball, he declined.  Instead,  young Gayles enlisted in the United States  Marine Corps. With his older brother David  serving in the U.S. Air Force, and Bobby  serving in Vietnam in the U.S. Army, I suppose he felt he was obligated to enlist. He received his basic training at Parris Island,  South Carolina, and upon completion was  stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  He later transferred to a Marine base in California. He quickly rose through the ranks  and became a corporal in just two years. He  was an attentive soldier and took his obligation to the Corps very seriously. He was a  \u2018\u2018textbook\u2019\u2019 Marine. Tough, no-nonsense and  cared deeply about those he served with.  \u2018\u2018Everybody in our platoon knew the outstanding  recruit was  a  black kid  from  Middlesboro, Ky., Lorenza Gayles,\u2019\u2019 writes  Alvin Simpson, author of \u2018\u2018Distant Shore: A  Memoir,\u2019\u2019 and fellow Marine recruit in basic  training with Rennie.  \u2018\u2018There was no question who could outfight  whom; I knew, he knew, and the entire platoon knew Lorenza was the real deal.\u2019\u2019  With  the war  in Vietnam  escalating,  Rennie was deployed on June 21, 1966. Just  over two months after arriving in Vietnam,  while on a reconnaissance patrol, Rennie was  on point (front man in the squad) when he  and the other members of his squad walked  into an ambush. He was killed instantly.  THEWAR  With the war in Vietnam so many years  behind us, many have tried to put it out of  their minds. But for those who served and  the  family members who  lost  loved ones  there, it haunts them every day. Deemed an  unpopular war, many returning Vietnam veterans were scorned, cursed, called \u2018\u2018baby killers,\u2019\u2019 and spat upon. The truth is, no war is  popular. War is, sometimes, just a necessary  evil. This great nation has long carried the  obligation to protect and defend those who  cannot defend  themselves against oppressions that exist in this world. And to the  over 58,000 soldiers that died and 1,300 still  listed as missing in action, we owe our eternal gratitude.  As a child growing up in the 1960s and early  1970s, the war in Vietnam to me was sitting  beside my father watching the nightly news  with Walter Cronkite. With the end of each  broadcast came the body count, the dead, the  wounded and the missing in action. Today,  newscasts are filled with coverage of brave  men and women memorialized who have  given their lives, and those troops returning  from Iraq and Afghanistan as they are met  at airports across the country by cheering  crowds and hailed as heroes and glorified as  they should be. They have dedicated their  lives to protect and serve this nation as soldiers, and are prepared to give their lives for  it.  We owe the same gratitude to those who  served in Vietnam. We all know someone  who served there and the memories of these  heroes are fleeting. These men and women  served with the same courage and dedication  as do the brave soldiers of today. We see  them every day. Take  just a moment to  thank them for their service and their sacrifice; just a pat on the back and a thank you  would mean so much. Most of all, take a moment to remember, honor and mourn those  who gave their lives for this great nation.  Our community lost too many fine young  men in Vietnam and it\u2019s up to us to pass on  their heritage so that they are not forever  lost to posterity. Remember that many of  these men and women sacrificed their ambitions so that we wouldn\u2019t have to. They died  for the very freedoms we enjoy every day.  When Rennie was killed in action in Vietnam I remember my mother saying  \u2018\u2018that  poor little Gayles boy.\u2019\u2019 This is something  that I have carried with me my entire life.  And with the passing of time and generations we owe it to them to carry on their  memories. This tall, handsome, young Marine with his broad beaming smile, with his  whole life ahead of him, he was one of those  men.  Rennie Gayles  is  not  just  a  housing  project; United  States Marine  Corporal  Lorenza Gayles was a guardian of freedom.  REMEMBRANCE  Forty-five years ago, on September 3, 1966,  just before your twentieth birthday,  in a  country, half a world away from home, in  the Quang Nam Province of South Vietnam  defending your nation with a profound sense  of duty and exemplary conduct becoming a  United States Marine, you made the ultimate sacrifice. Every day of my life I will  thank God for you, I will honor you, and I  will remember you . . . Semper Fi  On October  26,  1966, Corporal Lorenza  Gayles was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart. It was presented to his parents by  Major F.C. Fisher, U.S.M.C. Corporal Gayles  is  buried  in  the  Lynch  Cemetery  in  Middlesboro.  Sincerest appreciation to those who contributed to this article: Rennie\u2019s brother,  Bobby Gayles of Middlesboro; Bill Smith,  U.S. Army  (Ret.), of Middlesboro;  sister  Lelia Gayles-Cammon, Tuscaloosa, Alabama;  Alvin L. Simpson of Columbus, Ohio,  for  your friendship, encouragement, service to  our nation and loving tribute to your friend;  and a special thanks to Sgt. Timothy Moos  and the United States Marine Corps.  f  DREAM ACT  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 10 years  ago, I introduced the DREAM Act, legislation  that would  allow  a  select  group  of  immigrant  students with  great  potential  to  contribute more  fully to America.  The DREAM Act would give these  students a chance to earn legal status  if they came to the U.S. as children,  are long-term U.S. residents, have good  moral character, graduate from high  school, and complete 2 years of college  or military service in good standing.  The DREAM Act would make America a stronger country by giving these  talented immigrants the chance serve  in our military and contribute to our  economy.  Tens of thousands of highly-qualified,  well-educated young people would enlist in the Armed Forces if the DREAM  Act becomes law.  And studies have found that DREAM  Act participants would contribute literally trillions of dollars to the U.S.  economy during their working lives.  These young people have overcome  great obstacles to succeed. They are  valedictorians, star athletes, honor-roll  students, and ROTC leaders. Now they  want to give back to their country.  The DREAM Act would give them that  chance.  For the  last 10 years I have been  working on the DREAM Act, there has  been one constant: strong support from  the faith community. The DREAM Act  is supported by almost every religious  group you can imagine: Catholic, Methodist, Episcopal, Lutheran, and Evangelical Christians; Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Jews; and Muslims,  Hindus, and Sikhs.  The  faith community supports the  DREAM Act because it is based on a  fundamental moral principle that  is  shared by every religious tradition\u2014it  is wrong to punish children for the actions of their parents.  These students were brought to this  country as children. They grew up here  pledging allegiance to the American  flag and singing the only national anthem they\u2019ve ever known. They are  American  in  their hearts and  they  should not be punished for their parents\u2019 decision to bring them here.  For the next several weeks, people of  faith all across this country will show  their support for the DREAM Act by  celebrating  the  first-ever  \u2018\u2018DREAM  Sabbath.\u2019\u2019  On the DREAM Sabbath, at churches,  synagogues, mosques,  and  temples  around  the  country, Americans  of  many religious backgrounds will offer  prayers  for  the  immigrant  students  who would be eligible for the DREAM  Act.

The  Good Samaritan Society operates a number of  nursing homes around the country. Denton Village\u2019s inception in 1976 marked the beginning  of their exceptional service offerings in long-  term care and senior  living complexes. The  Denton Village has since expanded their services  to  include  twin homes, assisted  living,  and a second senior living apartment building.  My parents lived in a duplex at Denton Village. The facilities and staff at Denton Village  allowed my parents, Harry and Norma,  to  enjoy a more fulfilling and carefree life. When  it comes to providing individualized care the  people at Denton Village go above and beyond for their residents. Denton Village is a  place that cares for people, and is one of the  best nursing homes in Dallas Fort-Worth Area.  This anniversary is a wonderful opportunity  for us to celebrate and recognize the values of  the Good Samaritan Society and the delivery  of those values at the Denton Village. I am  truly proud to recognize everybody at Denton  Village for their 35th Anniversary of excellent  service, and I know the Denton community appreciates their years of service.

Ukrainian Village covers two miles along State Road and is home  to Ukrainian butcher shops, credit unions, two  Ukrainian Orthodox churches and now Ukrainian Village Park. The mission of Ukrainian Village is, \u2018\u2018To preserve, empower, and advance  Ukrainian Village as a  thriving neighborhood  by celebrating  the culture and heritage of  Ukrainian Americans and  to collaborate with  the City of Parma  in creating business and  economic development within its boundaries.\u2019\u2019  The Ukrainian Village Parade and Ukrainian  Village Park dedication will be hosted by the  City of Parma, Ukrainian Village Committee  and  the United Ukrainian Organizations of  Ohio.

These are serious  issues facing our country and the EPA, issues  that require serious solutions. Sadly, this bill  does nothing to actually address those issues.  In addition to the lack of a well thought-out  strategy, the proposed amendments to this bill  would make serious changes to the Clean Air  Act without any congressional hearing or testimony. None of these proposals have had serious examination by  the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over  this matter. This  is not  the open and  transparent legislative process that my colleagues  have committed  to. We cannot  responsibly  govern in this matter and ignore our Constitutional obligation to hold hearings, hear testimony, and give  these matters  the  in-depth  consideration major policy initiatives deserve.  As I said, there are legitimate problems with  some of  the proposed  rules coming out of  EPA, and they need to be dealt with. However, this Polish lawyer from Detroit happens  to believe we would get further with a more  surgical approach to dealing with these matters.  I am particularly concerned with the Utility  MACT, which in its current form, could have a  devastating effect on  the economy of Midwestern manufacturing States,  including my  home State of Michigan. I am convinced that  a balanced, bipartisan solution  to  this  issue  was available to us. In fact, I offered to work  with all of my colleagues, both Democrats and  Republicans on  this matter. Sadly, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would  rather play political games rather than work on  a reasonable solution to a legitimate problem.  I would note to my colleagues that we spent  only one day on the failed Continuing Resolution, but will spend two days on this bill. This,  I believe, demonstrates  the  true  intention of  the GOP. That is not to actually deal with a legitimate and disconcerting problem, but  to  spend  time on  their  favorite whipping boy,  EPA. Now, I have had my share of issues with  that particular agency, but  I have always  sought a solution\u2014not played games to gain  political points.  As such, it is my intent to vote against the  TRAIN Act and the amendments proposed by  the other side of the aisle. The President already indicated his strong opposition and as  such, the bill before us is nothing more than  veto bait.  I would call on my colleagues on  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:00 Sep 24, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\K23SE8.004 E23SEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",

KUCINICH  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 23, 2011  Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of the Czech Catholics of Greater  Cleveland\u2019s 88th Annual Feast of St. Wenceslaus on September 24, 2011 at Our Lady of  Lourdes Parish. This year\u2019s celebration will  also honor the 100th anniversary of the founding of Cleveland\u2019s former Holy Family Parish.  St. Wenceslaus  is  the patron saint of  the  Czech Republic. Every year, his  feast day,  September 28th, is celebrated by Czech communities around  the world. St. Wenceslaus  was  the  leader of Old Bohemia during  the  early part of the 10th Century. During his tenure as king, St. Wenceslaus  took a vow of  chastity and was devoted to his Christian faith.  Killed by his brother, St. Wenceslaus was later  canonized as a martyr of the Christian faith.  In addition  to celebrating  the Feast of St.  Wenceslaus,  the 100th anniversary of  the  founding of the former Holy Family Parish will  be recognized at this year\u2019s celebration. Holy  Family was  founded on November 6, 1911  after Father Rudolph Habrda noticed Bohemian families moving into Cleveland\u2019s Woodland Hills neighborhood. Over  the years, as  parishioners began  to move  to  the suburbs,  the parish school merged with St. Cecilia,  Epiphany and St. Mary of Czestochowa  to  form Mr. Pleasant Elementary School.  In  1988, the Holy Family Parish was closed.  Our Lady of Lourdes Parish is one of only  two Czech congregations left in the Cleveland  Catholic  Diocese,  along  with  St.  John  Nepomucene  in Slavic Village. The Czech  Catholics of Greater Cleveland will gather together on September 24th  for mass and a  celebration featuring the Hronek Czech Band.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me  in recognition of the 88th Annual Feast of St.  Wenceslaus.  I offer my best wishes  to  the  Czech Catholics of Greater Cleveland and all  those who attend this joyous celebration.  f  TAIWAN CENTENNIAL NATIONAL  DAY  HON. THOMAS E. PETRI  OFWISCONSIN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 23, 2011  Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I salute Taiwan on  its forthcoming Centennial National Day, also  known as Double-10 Day, October 10, 2011.  The Republic of China on Taiwan  is a  model of success for Asia. For over six decades now, the Taiwanese people have struggled to lift their island into the top ranks of the  world\u2019s  economies.  The  recently  released  2010 World Competitive Yearbook finds Taiwan to have the 8th most competitive economy among the 58 countries surveyed.  Over the past year, the number of employed  people has increased and the unemployment  rate has dropped to an enviable 5.17 percent.  Even more  important  than  its economic  achievements, Taiwan has developed  into a  strong and vibrant democracy. It is a valued  member of the free nations of the world, even  though  it  is burdened with particular and  unique  diplomatic  challenges\u2014challenges  which the Taiwanese people and government  have met with courage.  On the occasion of the Republic of China\u2019s  Centennial National Day, I hope there can be  renewed peaceful coexistence and co-prosperity between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. There have been many agreements  reached between the two sides, including direct air and sea links, increased mutual investments, and  regular negotiations over economic and other substantial issues.  Also, I offer my congratulations to Taiwan  for  its continued participation  in  the World  Health Assembly meetings last May in Geneva  and  to  its continuing commitment  to safeguarding human rights and other universal values.  Congratulations to the Republic of China. I  look  forward  to closer relations between  the  United States and Taiwan.  f  THE COME-FROM-BEHIND  GRASSHOPPERS WIN IT ALL  HON. HOWARD COBLE  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 23, 2011  Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, as Major League  Baseball begins its post-season push, the professional minor  leagues are concluding  their  seasons. The citizens of the Sixth District of  North Carolina are celebrating the first championship since 1982 of the Greensboro Grasshoppers of the South Atlantic League.  The Hoppers\u2014as  their  fans affectionately  call them\u2014were a dramatic, come-from-behind  team all season. It took the final games of the  season  for  the Hoppers  to even qualify  for  post-season play. Greensboro split  the  first  two games at home in the best-of-five championship series against  the Savannah Sand  Gnats. When the series moved to Savannah,  the Hoppers  lost game  three  to  the Sand  Gnats.  It has been 11 years  in  the  \u2018\u2018Sally  League\u2019\u2019 since a team leading two-games-to-  one  failed  to clinch  the championship. With  Savannah needing only one more win to capture the South Atlantic League title, the Hoppers were  facing  the end of  their season,  when they pulled out a heart-stopping, 11-inning win to force a fifth and deciding game.  Even  in  the championship game, Greensboro fell behind 2\u20130 early before cruising to 7\u2013  3 win to capture its first South Atlantic League  championship in almost three decades. Hoppers Manager Andy Haines told the Greensboro News & Record that he could not pick a  Most Valuable Player for the series. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s  no way I could name anyone,\u2019\u2019 Haines told the  newspaper. \u2018\u2018We had a lot of guys contribute.  It was someone different every night.\u2019\u2019  All of the Grasshoppers can be proud of the  regular season, along with the dramatic run to  the  title. Among  those who were part of  Greensboro\u2019s  first championship since 1982  included:  pitchers  Michael  Brady,  Alex  Caldera, Jordan Conley, Grant Dayton, James  Leverton, Miguel Mejia, Robert Morey, Gregory Nappo, Mike Ojala, Chris Shafer, Rett  Varner, Kyle Winters, and Brett Zawacki. The  catchers  were  Aaron  Dudley,  Wilfredo  Gimenez, and Jacob Realmuto. The infielders  included Daniel Black, Joe Bonadonna, Mark  Canha, Ryan Fisher, and Noah Perio. The  outfielders  were  lssac  Galloway, Marcell  Ozuna, James Wooster, and Christian Yelich.  Only one of those on the disabled list, Zachary  Neal, made it onto the post-season roster, but  the others contributed during  the year and  they included Kevin Cravey, Alan Oaks, Jay  Rogers, Adam Veres, and Sean Watson.  Greensboro  is one of  the best-run minor  league teams in the entire United States and  it  is because of an outstanding  front office.  This  championship  caliber  group  includes:  Donald Moore, President/General Manager;  Katie Dannemiller, Vice President, Baseball  Operations; Jimmy Kesler, CFO; Tim Vangel,  Assistant General Manager, Sales and Marketing; Jake Holloway, Assistant General Manager, Head Groundskeeper; Erich Dietz, Director of Ticketing; Todd Olson, Sales Associate;  Murray White, Sales Associate; Joey Burridge,  Sales  Associate/Ticket  Representative;  Rosalee Brewer, Sales Associate; John Redhead, Executive Director of Business Development; Laura Damico, Director of Community  and Event Development; Shawn Russell, Director of Promotions/Production; Amanda Williams, Director of Creative Services; Yunhui  Bradshaw, Director  of Merchandise; Chad  Green, Assistant Director of Stadium Operations;  Kaid  Musgrave,  Assistant  Groundskeeper; and Bob Perry, Clubhouse Director.  Championship Skipper Andy Haines was  ably assisted by Pitching Coach Willie Glen  and Hitting Coach Kevin Randel. The players  were kept  in championship  form all season  long by Athletic Trainer Masa Fujimoto and  Strength and Conditioning Coach Cody Clark.  On behalf of the citizens of the Sixth District  of North Carolina, we congratulate Greensboro  Grasshoppers owners Cooper Brantley, Wes  Elingburg and Len White and everyone affiliated with  the Hoppers on providing  its  fans  with so many dramatic moments during a  memorable season. All of us who  love  the  Hoppers are basking in the glow of the first  South Atlantic League Championship since  1982. We may see some of  today\u2019s Grasshoppers playing for the parent club\u2014the Florida Marlins\u2014in the near future, but none of us  will forget the 2011 season when Greensboro  came from behind numerous times to win it  all.  f  TRIBUTE TO DARRELL WALTRIP  HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 23, 2011  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, on  this  week when NASCAR\u2019s Chase for the Cup begins,  I rise  today  to celebrate another  landmark achievement  for a 3-time Cup winner  and resident of Tennessee\u2019s 7th District who I  am truly privileged to call a good friend. Darrell Waltrip will join the third class of inductees  in the NASCAR Hall of Fame.  Darrell was born and raised in Owensboro,  Kentucky, but began making his mark as a  professional driver at the old Nashville Speedway in the 1970s.

In the mid-1950s, the First United Methodist  Church of Carrollton needed to relocate. With  a generous donation from the Milburn Family  Farm, First United Methodist Church secured  five acres for future growth. Since 1967, First  United Methodist Church has been pastored  by Kenneth Carter, Dr. Paul Morell, and Rev.  Jerry Simmons, and  is currently under  the  spiritual  leadership of Dr. Richard Dunagin.  Throughout its history, First United Methodist  has continued to place an emphasis on evangelism in the mission field by providing dental  and medical care to those in need around the  world. In 2001, as the church celebrated its  centennial anniversary, land was provided for  a new church and school. In 2004, a new worship center opened which was adorned with  stained glass windows from the original sanctuary. Since 2004,  the church has added a  stadium and sports complex, meeting rooms,  and a new sanctuary that can accommodate  1,500 people.  Over the past 110 years, First United Methodist Church of Carrollton has also started  other successful ministries  in  the Carrollton  community. For example,  the Sonshine Preschool  expanded  into Carrollton Christian  academy, which  instructs students  from preschool through 12th grade.  In celebrating its 110th anniversary, we recognize  the positive  impact  that First United  Methodist Church has had on  the greater  Carrollton area. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my  distinguished colleagues  to  join me  in celebrating the rich history of First United Methodist Church of Carrollton.  f  MARINE AND HYDROKINETIC RENEWABLE  ENERGY  PROMOTION  ACT OF 2011  HON. JAY INSLEE  OFWASHINGTON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 23, 2011  Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, this week, I reintroduced  the Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act (H.R. 2994), a  bipartisan bill  that will  improve  the research  and development program for marine renewable energy. Marine energy  is an emerging  technology  that presents great opportunities.  Developing the ability to harness energy from  our ocean and  tidal currents  to power our  homes and businesses will create U.S. jobs by  building a new manufacturing industry and will  improve our energy security.  I would  like  to  recognize the leadership of Senator LISAMURKOWSKIwho has  introduced a Senate companion, which she has successfully moved  through  the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Further, I appreciate the  support of my House colleagues Representatives DONYOUNG and THEODOREDEUTCH in  working with me on this bill.  In the Puget Sound area of Washington, research and demonstration on tidal energy are  underway, requiring collaboration from the private sector, universities, research institutions  and public utilities. However, national leadership is needed to truly realize the benefits of  commercial-scale marine hydrokinetic projects  in the United States. The U.S. Department of  Energy established  the Northwest National  Marine Renewable Energy Center, run by the  University of Washington and Oregon State  University, to develop tidal and wave research  projects. They are working with  the private  sector to demonstrate new technologies. Additionally,  the Department of Energy\u2019s Marine  Sciences Laboratory on the Olympic Peninsula  assesses waterpower resource potential to address and remove environmental roadblocks  to deployment, testing to accelerate the integration of  large-scale waterpower electricity  generation into the Northwest power grid, and  is essential to establishing a robust basis for  industrial investment based on verifiable technology performance, assured cost basis, and  environmental performance.  The Marine Renewable Energy Promotion  Act will accelerate these efforts by establishing  a  competitive  research,  development  and  demonstration program at the Department of  Energy that is specifically devoted to marine  and hydrokinetic renewable energy. This office  will help to develop new marine renewable energy technologies, increase reliability and durability of facilities, reduce manufacturing and  operating costs of  the devices, help  identify  and address environmental impacts of marine  renewable energy and make sure  that such  power can be integrated into the national electricity grid. Additionally, the bill will ensure that  the Department of Energy works with research  institutions to set up marine and hydrokinetic  energy test facilities in the United States, supporting efforts underway nationwide and at the  University of Washington, which are critical in  our efforts  to demonstrate a wide  range of  technologies, and evaluate the technical viability of each new and emerging type of technology at different scales.  The Electric Power Research Institute has  estimated that ocean resources in the United  States could generate 252 million megawatt  hours of electricity, which given as much support as other types of renewable energy, could  be equivalent to 6.5 percent of America\u2019s entire electricity generation. With such great potential  to spur American  innovation and  job  creation, I urge my colleagues to support this  important bill.  f  TENNESSEE BAPTIST CHILDREN\u2019S  HOME  HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 23, 2011  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, one hundred years ago, a group of women from the  First Baptist Church in Nashville, TN, decided  to put action to their beliefs. Purchasing land  in Brentwood, TN,  in 1911,  the Tennessee  Baptist Orphans\u2019 Home moved from borrowed  space in a local hotel to a permanent home.  This move began a beautiful history of dedication and service to the least and most vulnerable among us.  Approximately 200 children a year are cared  for, fed, clothed, and taught about the hope  found in the Almighty. As children find themselves in houses of great crisis, thanks to the  care and support of  the Tennessee Baptist  Children\u2019s Home, they soon find themselves in  homes of great love. Need is the only qualification for children to find assistance and by  accepting  all  children  regardless  of  race,  creed,  or  socio-economic  background,  the  TBCH lives fully the call of those who follow  Christ.  I appreciate  the great work done by  the  Tennessee Baptist Children\u2019s Home and all  those who support its mission. From the couples who give their lives to parent other children to those whose prayers make this calling  possible, all who offer their time, talents, and  treasures  to  this great cause are helping  to  make the future brighter for Tennessee\u2019s children. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  the Tennessee Baptist Children\u2019s Home and  ask my colleagues to join with me in offering  great thanks for the work done in protecting  Tennessee\u2019s children.  f  TRANSPARENCY  IN REGULATORY  ANALYSIS OF IMPACTS ON THE  NATION ACT OF 2011  SPEECHOF  HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 22, 2011  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the state of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 2401) to require  analyses of the cumulative and incremental  impacts of certain rules and actions of the  Environmental Protection Agency, and for  other purposes:  Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2401. Instead of legislation that  would train Americans to get back to full employment, the majority is bringing to the floor  a bill that harms the health of our nation.  This bill would endanger the health of millions of our nation\u2019s children, seniors, and sick  by blocking rules to reduce cross-state air pollution and to reduce the emissions of mercury,  lead, dioxin, and other  toxic chemicals  from  power plants. H.R. 2401 would also delay future safeguards by requiring studies that only  measure pollution cleanup costs while disregarding health and other benefits.  Along with many of my colleagues,  I  recently sent letters to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in support of the Power  Plant Air Toxics Rule and the Cross-State Air  Pollution Control Rule because of the positive  impact  these  rules will have on  the public  health of our nation. Toxic air pollution from  power plants  remains a major unregulated  source of mercury and lead in the air. Already,  more than half of all coal-fired power plants  use widely available pollution control  technologies  to meet  these  important standards.  Once the rule is final, the remaining 44 percent will take similar steps to decrease dangerous pollutants, saving  thousands of  lives  and avoiding tens of thousands of illnesses. It  is clear that the benefits of the mercury and  air  toxics  standards will  far  outweigh  its  costs\u2014it is estimated that the pollution reductions required by the rule will yield health benefits of $59 billion  to $140 billion per year  (from lower health care costs and higher worker productivity), which  is 5  to 13  times  its  costs.  Further, by delaying the Cross-State Air Pollution Control Rule this bill would allow highly  polluting facilities located upwind to continue  to pollute major metropolitan areas with impunity. Such sources of pollution have made it  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:00 Sep 24, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\A23SE8.045 E23SEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",

            "7": "October 6, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE H6635  I want to also point out that this argument about jobs being lost is absolutely wrong for four reasons, and four  reasons you  shouldn\u2019t believe  them.  First, the claims are based on  fundamentally flawed studies, bought and  paid for by the regulated industry.  Second, the rules are stayed. EPA is  in the process of redoing them, and not  one of these studies has analyzed the  actual final rule.  Third, EPA has done a rigorous 251-  page economic analysis, and found that  the boiler  rules  issued  in February  would be expected to create over 2,000  jobs.  And finally, history tells us to be  very, very skeptical of industry claims  that the sky is falling. EPA is in the  process of rewriting these rules. I say  to the industry, let us work together to  fashion legislation that will solve the  immediate problems, a bill that can be  signed by the President, not this bill,  which may never see the light of day  out of the Senate, and if it did, the  President has indicated he would veto  it.  I now yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BARROW), a  member of our committee.  Mr. BARROW. I thank the ranking  member  for the time to express another view on the legislation.  I\u2019m proud to be an original sponsor of  the EPA Regulatory Relief Act. This  legislation was drafted in response to  new EPA  regulations  on  emissions  from industrial boilers. I believe those  regulations,  however well meaning,  cannot reasonably be met with today\u2019s  technologies. I believe that this bill is  a more reasonable solution than that  proposed by the EPA.  The choice before us is not between  the two mutually exclusive outcomes  of dirty air or more jobs. Our challenge  is to promote policies that serve both.  I think this bill strikes a better balance. It will spur industry to make investments that cut down on harmful  air emissions, while minimizing  the  chances  of  negative  economic  consequences and job losses.  I\u2019m proud to have worked in a productive, bipartisan way to get this bill  to the  floor, and encourage my colleagues\u2019 support.  Mr. WHITFIELD. At  this  time  I  would like to yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman  from Texas  (Mr. HALL), who\u2019s  chairman of  the  Science Committee.  Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, Chairman  WHITFIELD, of course I rise in support  of H.R. 2250.  As policymakers, it\u2019s our job to use  common sense and judgment to balance  the universal priorities of a  strong  economy, security at home and security abroad, and healthy communities.  And this country has a history of remarkable achievement  in addressing  these priorities. However, with an unemployment rate of more than 9 percent, it\u2019s irresponsible for the executive branch to stifle job growth and, for  that matter, to create job loss through  the outrageous and inflexible negotiations and regulations.  In my  district  alone,  the Boiler  MACT rules threaten more than 800  good-paying manufacturing jobs. These  are not  jobs that can be re-created.  Once eliminated, they\u2019re gone. Several  weeks  ago Assistant Administrator  Gina McCarthy  stated arrogantly,  I  don\u2019t want to create the  impression  that EPA is in the business of creating  jobs.  I feel that statement\u2019s inappropriate  and unfeeling toward those who have  lost their jobs and lost the ability to  provide for their family\u2019s future. H.R.  2250 is a clear statement by Congress  that EPA slow down and allow for reasoning along with some regulations.  The President said that his administration would be the most transparent  in history. Instead, we find clandestine  models, cherry-picking of data, double-  counting of benefits, and a failure to  follow basic peer  review guidelines.  This is a recipe for losing the public\u2019s  trust. EPA needs a timeout, and this  bill provides it.  I urge all my colleagues to support  this bill.  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Chairman, can  you inform us as to how much time is  remaining on both sides?  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  from  Massachusetts has 11 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Kentucky  has 131\u20444minutes remaining.  Mr. MARKEY. I yield 5 minutes to  the  gentleman  from Virginia  (Mr.  MORAN).  Mr. MORAN. I thank my very good  friend for yielding to me.  Mr. Chairman, a  rigorous peer-reviewed analysis, called \u2018\u2018The Benefits  and Costs of the Clean Air Act from  1990 to 2020,\u2019\u2019 conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency,  found  that  the  air  quality  improvements  under the Clean Air Act will save $2  trillion by 2020, and prevent at least  230,000 deaths annually\u2014230,000  lives  saved on an annual basis. We could  save four times the number of people  killed each year in automobile accidents by reducing air pollution.  Yet, just 2 weeks ago, this Chamber  approved legislation to block the EPA  from implementing rules to clean up  the single largest stationary source of  air pollution. That  legislation gave  this Nation\u2019s oldest and dirtiest coal-  fired power plants another pass to pollute and avoid compliance with the  Clean Air Act.  Today we\u2019re considering legislation,  the EPA Regulatory Relief Act, to exempt the second-largest source of hazardous air pollution:  Industrial and  commercial boilers, process heaters,  and commercial and  industrial solid  waste incinerators.  Under this bill, these large boilers  and  incinerators would be given at  least a 75-month pass from regulation;  a 15-month delay before any new rules  could be issued, and an additional 5  years beyond that delay before any new  emission standards could be issued; and  no deadline  for  industry compliance.  This bill does more than just offer a  pass from regulation. It also ensures  that any final regulation will be weaker than what the law requires.  The final section of this bill deals  with the Clean Air Act\u2019s most protective legal standard for reducing toxic  air pollution, the Maximum Available  Control Technology. After  20 years,  we\u2019re replacing it with the absolutely  least protective of measures,  called  \u2018\u2018work  practice  standards\u2019\u2019  such  as  equipment tuneups that need not even  reduce emissions.  Pass this bill and you sentence hundreds of thousands to asthma attacks  and a lifetime of health complications.  Pass this bill and you saddle our economy with unnecessary costs and employers with millions of additional sick  days. Pass this bill and you trigger an  additional 20,000 heart attacks. Pass  this bill and you condemn tens of thousands of Americans  to a premature  death.  b1000  Mr. Chairman,  the Cement Sector  Regulatory Relief Act that unfortunately will pass today and the TRAIN  Act that passed 2 weeks ago constitute  an all-out war between this Nation\u2019s  dirtiest  industries  and  the Federal  agency charged with protecting  the  public\u2019s health. EPA has become the  symbol, the center, of a debate over the  role of government. It\u2019s a sad commentary for this Chamber that an industry that prefers to invest in the political process rather than in saving  lives by reducing harmful emissions is  in fact winning the debate.  In fact, the coal consuming industries that have underwritten this assault on EPA were  invited early on  during the first year of the Obama administration to sit down and craft a  compliance option. The administration  had hoped to craft a deal similar to the  historic deal it made with the Nation\u2019s  auto  industry on  fuel efficiency and  tailpipe emissions. An article by Coral  Davenport in the September 22 issue of  the National Journal referenced this  meeting. But unlike the auto industry,  the coal consuming industries refused  to negotiate.  Instead, and let me quote from the  article, they \u2018\u2018banded together with the  Republican Party to strategize, and the  2010 midterm elections offered the perfect battleground. The companies invested heavily in campaigns to elect  Tea  Party  candidates  crusading  against the role of Big Government. Industry groups (like the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce), Tea Party groups with  deep ties to polluters (like Americans  for Prosperity), and  so-called  super  PACs  (like  Karl  Rove\u2019s  American  Crossroads) spent record amounts to  help elect the new House Republican  majority.\u2019\u2019  My colleagues, this is a bill peddled  by an industry that refuses to clean up  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:09 Oct 07, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K06OC7.013 H06OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o R E K L A W P         ",

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2 of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intention to  raise a question of the privileges of the  House.  The form of the resolution is as follows:  Whereas on October 2, 2011, the Washington  Post reported a story called  \u2018\u2018Rick Perry  And A Word Set On Stone\u2019\u2019;  Whereas upon reading that story the vast  majority of people in the United States were  morally outraged;  Whereas most of the facts in this resolution come from that Washington Post story;  Whereas Governor Rick Perry has  described a childhood  in Haskell County  in  Paint Creek, Texas, as centered on Boy  Scouts, school, and church;  Whereas Texas Governor Rick Perry  is  from West Texas and was originally a Southern Democrat\u2014often known as Dixiecrats\u2014  who switched parties in the late 1980s to become a Republican and is currently a leading  Republican presidential candidate;  Whereas ranchers who once grazed cattle  on the 1,070-acre parcel  in Throckmorton  County on the Clear Fork of the Brazos  River\u2014near  where  Governor  Perry  was  raised in Paint Creek, Texas\u2014it has since become a hunting ground that was called by  the name \u2018\u2018Niggerhead\u2019\u2019 well before Governor  Perry and his father, Ray, began hunting  there in the early 1980s even though there is  no definitive account of when the rock first  appeared on the property;  Whereas the use of the term \u2018\u2018Niggerhead\u2019\u2019  to describe a hunting retreat is morally offensive;  Whereas Ronnie Brooks, a local resident  who guided a few turkey shoots for Governor  Perry between 1985 and 1990, said he holds  Governor Perry \u2018\u2018in the highest esteem\u2019\u2019 but  said this of the rock at the camp: \u2018\u2018It kind of  offended me, truthfully\u2019\u2019;  Whereas Haskell  County  Judge David  Davis, sitting in his courtroom and looking  at a window there, said the word was \u2018\u2018like  those are vertical blinds. It\u2019s just what it  was called. There was no significance other  than a hunting deal\u2019\u2019\u2014in other words, the  judge was morally vacuous;  Whereas the name of this particular parcel  did not change for years and for many remained the same after it became associated  with Rick Perry, first as a private citizen,  then as a State official, and finally as Texas  Governor;  Whereas some local residents still call it  by  the  morally  repugnant  name  \u2018\u2018Niggerhead\u2019\u2019;  Whereas as recently as this summer, the  slab-like rock\u2014lying  flat, portions of the  name still faintly visible beneath a coat of  white paint\u2014remained by the gated entrance  to the camp;  Whereas asked last week about the name,  Governor Perry said the word on the rock is  an offensive name that has no place in the  modern world\u2014implying that it may have  been okay and had an appropriate place in  that community when he was growing up;  Whereas Mae Lou Yeldell has lived in Haskell County, Texas, for 70 years and recalls  the racism she faced in the 1950s and 1960s in  West Texas, when being called an offensive  name\u2014like Whites  greeting Blacks with  \u2018\u2018Morning  nigger\u2019\u2019\u2014was  \u2018\u2018like  a  broken  record\u2019\u2019;  Whereas Throckmorton County, where the  hunting camp is located near Haskell County, was for years considered a virtual no-go  zone for African-Americans because of old  stories told by locals about the lynching of  an African-American man there;  Whereas Haskell County began observing  Martin Luther King Jr. Day just two years  ago according to a county commissioner in  Haskell County;  Whereas Governor Perry grew up in a segregated era whose history has defined and  complicated the careers of many Southern  politicians;  Whereas Governor Perry has spoken often  about how his upbringing in this sparsely  populated farming community influenced his  conservatism;  Whereas Governor Perry  says he mentioned the offensive word on the rock to his  parents shortly after they had signed a lease  and he had visited the property, and they  rather immediately painted over the word  during the next July 4 holiday, but seven  people interviewed by the Washington Post  said they still saw the word on the rock at  various points during the years that the  Perry family was associated with the property through his father, partners, or his signature on a lease;  Whereas another local resident who visited  the property with Governor Perry and the  legislators he brought there to go hunting  recalled seeing the rock with the name clearly visible;  Whereas how, when, or whether Governor  Perry dealt with it when he was using the  property isn\u2019t clear and adds a dimension to  the emerging biography of Governor Perry  who quickly moved into the top tier of Republican presidential candidates when he entered the race in August; and  Whereas Herman Cain is the only Republican presidential candidate to criticize Governor Rick Perry  for being  \u2018\u2018insensitive\u2019\u2019  when the word was not immediately condemned, but we would remind Herman Cain  that the word is not only \u2018\u2018insensitive\u2019\u2019, but  is also \u2018\u2018offensive\u2019\u2019: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives\u2014  (1) calls on Governor Rick Perry to apologize for not immediately doing away with  the  rock  that  contained  the  word  \u2018\u2018Niggerhead\u2019\u2019 at the entrance of a ranch he  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:09 Oct 07, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A06OC7.032 H06OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o R E K L A W P         ",

The only reason I am  speaking out on this issue is this: To  get others involved. Our economic future and way of life here in Giles County could be on the line unless residents,  business owners, civic organizations,  and others come together and support  H.R. 2250.\u2019\u2019  You know what, ladies and gentlemen? The people of America understand that the EPA is in fact killing  jobs. They understand that while we  have to have a clean environment, and  we all want a clean environment, as  the gentleman from Kentucky said earlier today, we can do that. This is a  reasonable approach. H.R. 2250 is a very  reasonable  approach which will  do  both, continue us on the regulatory  path but make sure those regulations  are reasonable and effective, and make  sure that we protect the jobs of the  United States of America while we go  forward in protecting the environment  as well.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is  recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. WAXMAN. I just want to point  out to my colleagues that what the bill  does is repeals the previous rule, regulation, and then prohibits EPA from  adopting  another  regulation  for  15  months. And when they adopt another  regulation, it can\u2019t be enforced for another  5 years. And  then  there\u2019s no  deadline. But meanwhile, they  lower  the standard for EPA in setting that  regulation.  EPA is in the process now of negotiating with the industry to work out  the information and the problems that  have been brought to their attention.  We ought to give EPA the chance to do  that and get the full input from the industry.  If  legislation  is needed, we  ought to consider what legislation is  needed. The approach of this bill is to  set us back enormously. When you  don\u2019t have anything in place but the  weakest  possible  criteria,  and  then  nothing can happen for 5 years, and  maybe even longer because it takes 15  months to get the regulation, no enforcement for 5 years after that\u2014and  maybe never\u2014that\u2019s not a reasonable  approach.  If the industry wants a law, the industry ought to work on telling us  what they need, and not going on this  escapade with  the Republicans who  would like to repeal the whole Clean  Air Act and repeal the ability of the  EPA to protect the public from toxic  pollution. And, of course, the amendment that\u2019s before us is that insofar as  this bill becomes law, when we\u2019re talking about poisoning children\u2019s brains,  we\u2019re not going to stop EPA from getting their regulations in place and getting  them enforced.  It\u2019s obscene  to  think, the idea that we would wait another 61\u20442years, and maybe longer, before we can do anything to start down  the road to reduce the pollution that\u2019s  going to poison these kids.  I ask  for an  \u2018\u2018aye\u2019\u2019 vote on  the  amendment, and I hope that people realize this is a bill that will pass the  House, but in my view, given the President\u2019s statement of a veto,  it\u2019s not  going to become law.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is  on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. WAXMAN).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.  Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  The Acting  CHAIR. Pursuant  to  clause 6 of rule XVIII,  further proceedings on the amendment offered by  the gentleman from California will be  postponed.  AMENDMENTNO. 6OFFEREDBYMR. RUSH  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I have an  amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will  designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  At the end of section 5, add the following:  (c) RULEOFCONSTRUCTION.\u2014This section is  intended to supplement the provisions of,  and shall not be construed to supersede any  requirement, limitation, or other provision  of, sections 112 and 129 of the Clean Air Act  (42 U.S.C. 7412, 7429).  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman  from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, let us not  be distracted by this confused, backward, and short-term thinking on the  part of our Republican colleagues. This  bill represents just another attack on  the Nation\u2019s  long-standing  environmental protection laws in general and  the EPA in particular.  On behalf of a select few polluting industries  that operate under  the assumption that the timing is right to  permanently alter, gut, and obliterate  the Clean Air Act, the law that the  chairman  of  the  subcommittee  and  many others have said is working on  behalf of the American people.  While most  businesses  have  been  planning and preparing for these rules,  which have already been delayed for  years and in some cases have been delayed over a decade, some of the more  opportunistic dirty industries see this  radical Republican majority and their  radical agenda targeting the EPA and  all of our clean air laws as the perfect  time to try and permanently alter the  Clean Air Act.  Section 5 of H.R. 2250 disregards the  clean air standards that will help reduce toxic air pollution, like mercury  and soot from some of our Nation\u2019s biggest polluters\u2014cement plants,  industrial boilers, and incinerators.  Instead, this section would make fundamental and damaging changes to the  Clean Air Act and would ensure that  future standards do not meaningfully  reduce emissions into the air.  b1300  So, Mr. Chairman, I must offer an  amendment that will clarify that section 5 of H.R. 2250 is intended to supplement the provisions of and shall not  be construed to supersede any requirement, limitation or other provision of  sections 112 and 129 of the Clean Air  Act.  This single provision in section 5 will  have the effect of exempting incinerators, exempting industrial boilers, and  exempting cement plants  from maximum reductions in toxic air pollution  emissions, in contrast to every other  major industrial source of toxic air pollution in this Nation.  The majority, even after being asked  repeatedly  over  and  over  and  over  again, has yet to explain why Congress  should carve out exemptions for the  Nation\u2019s dirtiest polluters, in total disregard  for the public health of the  American people and at the expense of  those very companies that have already  invested  in the technology to  meet  the minimum  requirements of  this law.  Mr. Chairman, if it is truly the majority\u2019s intent to clarify the rules and  to provide certainty for business, then  this amendment will accomplish that  purpose; but I don\u2019t believe that that is  their intent, and I don\u2019t believe that  that is what their goal and objectives  are. They have a singular purpose in all  of these bills that we have been debating on this floor as it relates to the  Clean Air Act, and that  is to completely nullify and gut the Clean Air  Act so that polluters in this Nation can  keep on polluting the very air that we  breathe.  So, Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my  colleagues to support my amendment.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. YODER). The  time of the gentleman from Illinois has  expired.  (On request of Mr. WAXMAN, and by  unanimous consent, Mr. RUSHwas allowed  to  proceed  for  1  additional  minute.)  Mr. RUSH. I yield to the ranking  member.  Mr. WAXMAN. I thank you for yielding to me. I want to join you in urging  support for this amendment.  Whatever the motivation is of your  legislation\u2014and I can understand your  reason for being very skeptical. I share  it. But what the industry should want  is regulatory certainty. And this bill  adds more confusion to what is already  a long overdue effort to reduce toxic  air pollution from boilers and incinerators. With no timeline for implementation of new emissions standards, the  bill creates significant questions about  how EPA would set limits for toxic air  pollution. If they think it\u2019s regulatory  certainty that they don\u2019t have to do  anything for years, they\u2019d better not  count on it.

            "39": "October 6, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE H6667  pants and a shirt and there would be no  bulge. He had one of those amazing  bodies where he always looked fit, even  into his eighties.  But the thing that I want to say  about Reverend Shuttlesworth is that  there was  never  a  challenge  that  caused Fred Shuttlesworth  to back  away. There was no  threat  strong  enough that Fred Shuttlesworth would  seek cover. He was always out front,  willing to take whatever came his way  in order to pursue the fight for justice.  When I was elected mayor of Kansas  City, one of the highlights of my time  in office was Fred Shuttlesworth visiting Kansas City and coming into my  office and getting excited because on  the wall in my office hung a photograph, an enlarged photograph which  showed Fred Shuttlesworth and a large  number of other civil rights  leaders  and giants who I was just pleased to be  around hanging on the wall prior to a  march we had done in Greene County,  Alabama. And I was so thrilled that  Fred Shuttlesworth could come to my  office and see his photograph hanging  and know how much I appreciated him.  Let me just say this\u2014and I\u2019ll pass  this on\u2014Fred Shuttlesworth preached  at the church I have been fortunate to  pastor for over 30 years. And each time  he would come in and he\u2019d say, now,  Cleaver, I want to show you how you  can preach a  long sermon. And his  strategy was this: after about 30 minutes, he would say, and wink at me,  I\u2019m about to wrap up now. And he said,  then people would listen to him waiting because they knew he was about to  wrap up. And then 10 or 15 minutes  later he\u2019d say, I\u2019m on my way out now.  I\u2019m closing out. So Fred Shuttlesworth  could easily preach an hour and trick  people two or three times. And that  was what he called training me in how  to preach a long sermon.  And he preached at our church many  times.  In  fact,  the  last  time  he  preached there, which was probably 2  years ago, he was a little frail for the  first time that I had ever been around  him. And he was still fiery, as our colleague, JOHN LEWIS, will  tell you.  There was never a time that he did not  have fire. In fact, his autobiography is  entitled,  \u2018\u2018Fire  Inside My  Bones,\u2019\u2019  which I have in my office.  And he, I think, was the epitome of  the civil rights struggle. He did a lot of  struggling. He never made a  lot of  money. He never got a lot of publicity.  There are probably people in the country  who  hear  the  name  Fred  Shuttlesworth and not know who he is.  This morning I turned on MSNBC  and saw his name being scrolled across  the bottom of the television set, that  the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, age  89, died  in a Birmingham, Alabama,  hospital. And I sat there thinking, you  know, the great tragedy is that probably millions of people are looking at  that and saying to themselves, I have  no idea who Fred Shuttlesworth is.  And I\u2019m here to tell you, had there  not been a Fred Shuttlesworth, there  never would have been a Birmingham  moment. Had there not been a Birmingham movement,  the  Southern  Christian Leadership Conference would  never have existed, which meant that  Martin Luther King would have gotten  his PhD and pastored a church, perhaps  in Atlanta, Georgia, and nobody would  have heard of him.  So I take great pride in the opportunity to just talk about a friend and a  mentor,  the  Reverend  Fred  Shuttlesworth,  a  great  civil  rights  leader, a great Baptist preacher, and a  great human being.  Ms. SEWELL. Thank you so much. I  was  born  in Selma, Alabama,  and  raised in Selma, and my home church  is Brown Chapel AME Church. And I remember so many commemorations of  the march from Selma to Montgomery  always  culminated  on  that Sunday  when they commemorate Bloody Sunday in my church. And I can remember  often seeing Reverend Shuttlesworth  at Brown Chapel and crossing that Edmund Pettus Bridge that he did so  often in those commemorations.  My last time seeing him, he participated in a Faith in Politics luncheon  that we had this past year, this past  March and when I was so honored to  co-host that Faith in Politics pilgrimage back to Alabama with Congressman LEWIS.  I know that my generation owes a  debt of gratitude to the Freedom Riders, to the folks, the civil rights activists such as Reverend Shuttlesworth  and JOHNLEWIS. We owe so much to  them. We not only  stand on  their  shoulders, but we pay honor and tribute to them always. They fought the  good fight so that people like us could  go to Ivy League schools, could walk  the Halls of Congress, and I\u2019m just forever grateful  for  their courage and  their sacrifice.  b1550  I am equally thrilled to now yield  time to Congressman JOHNLEWIS of  Georgia. The gentleman from Georgia  is one of my own personal heroes and  will  speak  to  knowing  Fred  Shuttlesworth personally and talk of  the  times  in  the  sixties  that  they  shared together. I am just immensely  honored to be able to call Congressman  LEWISa friend as well as colleague.  Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker,  I want to thank my friend and colleague, Congresswoman TERRISEWELL  from Birmingham,  for holding  this  Special Order. Thank you  for  representing the people of the Seventh  Congressional District of Alabama, especially Birmingham and Selma.  I grew up reading and hearing about  Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, the man  from Birmingham, Alabama. I grew up  about 150 miles from Birmingham outside of a little town called Troy. The  words of Fred Shuttlesworth, the actions of this man were so inspiring, I  probably wouldn\u2019t be  standing here  today, I know I wouldn\u2019t be standing  here today as a Member of Congress  representing the good people of the  Fifth District of Georgia if it hadn\u2019t  been  for  individuals  like  Fred  Shuttlesworth.  The Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth is  the last of a kind. He was a fearless, determined, courageous leader for civil  rights and social justice. When others  did not have the courage to stand up,  speak  up  and  speak  out,  Fred  Shuttlesworth put all he had on the  line to end segregation and racial discrimination not only in Birmingham  but throughout the State of Alabama  and throughout our Nation.  As has been said so well before, he  was beaten with chains, his home was  bombed, his church was bombed, and he  lived under constant threat of violence  and murder; but he never, ever  lost  faith in the power of love to overcome  hate.  He escorted brave young children to  desegregate  public  schools  in  Birmingham. In 1961, and I will never, ever  forget it, when I was only 21 years old,  during the Freedom Rides, 50 years  ago, when others were immobilized by  fear, he was fearless and met us at the  Greyhound bus station in Birmingham,  Alabama, and welcomed us  into his  home. When we were trapped in the  First Baptist Church a few days later,  pastored by the Reverend Ralph Abernathy in downtown Montgomery, after  we had been beaten by an angry mob  and the church had been surrounded by  individuals who  tried  to  burn  the  church down, he stood up and he spoke.  He gave us courage. He told us not to  be afraid.  He worked tirelessly beside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and others as he  led the Birmingham Movement. In 1963  when Bull Connor, the commissioner of  public safety, used dogs and fire hoses  on peaceful protesters, including young  children  and  women,  Fred  Shuttlesworth was there.  And I will never  forget, Congresswoman SEWELL, when we went back to  Selma  in  2007, Fred Shuttlesworth  wanted to cross that bridge one more  time. He was unable to walk. He was in  a wheelchair. Then-Senator Barack  Obama pushed  the chair across  the  bridge. Former President Clinton came  and kneeled down at the chair in front  of Fred Shuttlesworth to pay tribute  and homage to him.  This brave and courageous man must  be remembered. In my estimation, he  is one of the Founding Fathers of the  New America. He helped liberate, not  just the State of Alabama, not just the  South, but he helped liberate America;  and  that\u2019s why we honor him. He  helped change and made us a different  people, made us stand up, walk, run,  and march with pride. We owe him a  debt of gratitude. He will be deeply  missed.  When we go back to Birmingham, or  to Montgomery, or to Selma, or any  part of the American South, we may  see a statue at the Civil Rights Institute or Museum in Birmingham, but we  will see Fred Shuttlesworth all over  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:41 Oct 07, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K06OC7.091 H06OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o R E K L A W P         ",

PRAYER  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today\u2019s  opening prayer will be offered by the  Reverend D. Edward Chaney,  senior  pastor of Second Baptist Church in Las  Vegas, NV.  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:  Let us pray.  Bless us now, O God. Touch our  hearts, for without Your love, light,  and life, we are nothing.  Give our  lawmakers  strength and  courage as they make decisions today  that impact the lives of all Americans.  Lord, remove the divisive spirit that  prohibits  true  transformation  and  allow Your presence to become not just  common but harmonious. Through our  dedication, commitment, and sacrifice,  we thank You for cleansing us from the  ills of this world and making us fit to  serve and honor You.  We ask these blessings in Your Name.  Amen.  f  PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE  The Honorable SHELDONWHITEHOUSE  led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:  I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the  United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God,  indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  f  APPOINTMENT OF ACTING  PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.

To the Senate:  Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3,  of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby  appoint the Honorable SHELDONWHITEHOUSE,  a Senator from the State of Rhode Island, to  perform the duties of the Chair.  DANIELK. INOUYE,  President pro tempore.  Mr. WHITEHOUSE  thereupon  assumed the chair as Acting President  pro tempore.  f  RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY  LEADER  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority  leader  is  recognized.  f  WELCOMING REVEREND CHANEY  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the  rare opportunity today to  introduce  and say a few words about the guest  Chaplain. Reverend Chaney has just delivered, as usual, an eloquent invocation.  Reverend Chaney is originally from  South Carolina, but for the last 2 years  he has led the flock of the Second Baptist Church in Las Vegas, one of the  oldest, extremely well-established, and  largest churches in Las Vegas, NV. He  is a man who is involved in the community very deeply. He  serves on  the  board of the Urban League and the  NAACP.  In addition to his service in the spiritual realm, he has also served as a patriot in our Nation\u2019s armed services.  He served in the Navy for 4 years, as  has our Chaplain, Dr. Barry Black.  They were both naval officers. Reverend Chaney recently retired as chaplain of the U.S. Air Force Reserve at  Nellis Air Force Base.  I have met with Reverend Chaney  under very unique circumstances on a  number of occasions. He is a wonderful  human being. He is one of those rare  people who have such a pleasant demeanor. The minute a person meets  him, they know he is a man of great  substance and spiritual quality. So I  am very happy to welcome Reverend  Chaney and his wife Avis to Washington.  I thank the pastor for the inspiring  invocation, which I hope will guide the  Senate\u2019s action today.  f  SCHEDULE  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following  leader remarks, the Senate will resume  consideration of S. 1619, the China currency legislation. The deadline for second-degree amendments to that legislation is at 10 a.m. this morning. At  10:30, there will be a rollcall vote on  the motion to  invoke cloture on S.  1619.  f  MEASURE PLACED ON THE  CALENDAR\u2014S. 1660  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am told  that S. 1660 is at the desk and due for  a second reading.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.

            "55": "October 6, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S6285  making the point with great repetition  while listening to a lot of grumbling  that the price for being in the majority  is, you have to take bad votes; you  have to take votes you don\u2019t like in  order to get legislation across the floor  and finished.  So this is not ancient times we are  talking about where the minority actually got votes, took votes, and were not  shut out. I hope we can move back in  that direction.

Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The  THEJOBSACT  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, as were  many of my colleagues, I was back  home last week talking, in my case, to  Alaskans,  and  the  issues  on  their  minds are pretty simple: the economy  and jobs. Alaska has fared better than  most States over the last 2 years, but  no matter where I go\u2014maybe a small  convenience store, while I am driving  around town or at Home Depot, a gas  station,  or wherever  I may  get  a  chance to engage with Alaskans\u2014people are concerned about the economy  and the ability for jobs to be created in  this great country of ours.  Alaskans know  the  economy will  take some time to turn around. That is  why today I am pleased to talk a little  bit about the jobs act before us this  week and, hopefully, while moving forward we will spend some time on the  debate about how important this work  will be.  Last week when I was in Alaska, I  had Transportation Secretary LaHood  in Alaska, and we had a chance to travel around and get a good sense of what  is important to Alaska with regard to  ports, roads, airports, and rail. The  core infrastructure of our State is no  different than any other State. It is  critical that we repair, put into shape,  some of the facilities that are falling  apart or, in some cases, expand them.  The jobs act alone would mean $200  million  to  repair Alaska\u2019s  transportation network.  As one can imagine, that $200 million  will be spent in the private sector by  construction companies and contractors hiring private individuals, workers  to work on  those  jobs\u2014good-paying  jobs to provide good incomes for their  families. The same is true that the jobs  act will offer  for Alaska around $62  million for school construction.  As I travel around my State\u2014and I  am sure  for many other States\u2014the  need is strong for improvements to and  expansion of  schools  for  those  that  have been there for many years and  have not had  the  renovations necessary, again, providing hundreds and  hundreds of jobs.  The jobs act also has some good steps  to deal with small businesses\u2014how to  ensure they get a break off their taxes,  to ensure they have a benefit as we try  to move this economy forward. The tax  provisions, the payroll tax reduction,  which would affect 20,000 Alaska businesses in a positive way, will reduce  their tax burden, as well as working  families, who will see a reduction in  their payroll taxes.  On average, for a middle-class family, it would be almost $2,000\u2014not a  bad gift, in a sense, as we move into  this holiday season. But it is really  their money. Giving back this $2,000 to  middle-class families means they will  put  it  into the economy. They will  spend it in the economy. They will use  it as they see fit.  However, I wish to lay down a marker. As I have said, the jobs bill is important for the roads and water and  sewer and ports that need to be repaired and renovated and expanded, the  schools that need to be built or expanded and repaired also, as well as the  benefits to our small business community and the benefits to our middle-  class working families\u2014all important.  But how we pay for it is also important  because we have to make sure it is paid  for. But I wish to put down a marker  on at least the first proposal that was  laid down regarding how the President  was planning to pay for this.  Let me first start with the oil and  gas industry. The oil and gas industry  for Alaska is about 85 percent of our  economy in the sense that the money  goes into our State treasury and provides well over 40,000 jobs. Nationwide,  the oil and gas industry produces over  9 million jobs and contributes over $2  trillion to our economy.  I know some of my colleagues on my  side of the aisle like to blast Big Oil.  But as we know, the oil and gas industry is made up of hundreds, well over  500 companies of all sizes\u2014small, medium-sized, and large. Singling out a  growing industry and imposing a tax  penalty,  in my view,  is  the wrong  choice. It is the wrong road to go down.  We need to recognize the potential for  more  job  creation  instead  by  supporting increased domestic oil and gas  development.  By developing Alaska\u2019s Arctic offshore resources alone, we can create  over 50,000  jobs nationwide over the  coming decade, jobs being created right  here in our country. As an example, 400  jobs just in Washington to upgrade the  Kulluk drilling unit which will be utilized in Alaska or the 1,000 jobs in Louisiana to build a new Arctic supply ship  right now.  So when we look at the potential,  and when we look at the opportunities  in the Arctic for oil and gas development, it creates American jobs, American  jobs not only  in the Arctic  in  Alaska but also throughout the country where many of the facilities or the  material utilized  is  located  to construct what is needed, such as in Washington State and Louisiana, as I mentioned.  Also, Federal revenue would be generated. The Chamber of Commerce has  estimated that developing and increasing production on Federal lands could  produce well over $200 billion in new  revenues to our country.  An Alaska analysis puts the Federal  revenues just for Beaufort and Chukchi  Sea at $160 billion. For those who are  not  familiar with where  those are,  those are just above the North Slope in  the Arctic. These have a potential of  well over 24 billion barrels of oil development in the known technically recoverable reserves today\u2014upwards to  24 billion, 26 billion.  I will tell you I do support\u2014and I understand in the original proposal they  wanted to take away some of these tax  incentives that help our industry move  forward, especially the smaller companies to expand exploration and development. I recognize that tax reform needs  to be done, and I am a strong supporter  of tax reform. Senator WYDENand Senator COATS and  I have supported a  piece of legislation that is all about tax  reform. I believe in a holistic proposal,  not just selective industries. So do not  get me wrong. Do I believe in tax reform? Do I believe in trying to clear  out loopholes and incentives that are  not working or may be used improperly? Absolutely. Again, that is why we  supported a much broader perspective.  But in pay-fors or tax proposals to pay  for the jobs bill, this is not the right  approach.  Another concern I have is on aviation. Alaska has 6 times more pilots  and 16 times more aircraft per capita  than any other State in the country.  Alaska has limited road infrastructure.  Eighty percent of our communities are  accessed not by roads but by water or  air. So it is critical we have the right  kind of aviation system.  General aviation is not a luxury in  Alaska, it is a necessity. It is our highway in the sky. That is the utilization  of our airlines and small planes. The  general aviation component is critical  for business, life safety, moving things  from one village to another.  One piece of the President\u2019s jobs bill  would change the way businesses can  treat the depreciation of general aviation aircraft and create a disincentive  to buy American-made aircraft and further depress an industry that has already felt a significant impact due to  the recession.

            "63": "October 6, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S6293  from coming to the floor this year, 2011  would be the first year since 1960 in  which the Congress has not passed the  Defense Authorization Act. In over 50  years, this would be the first time this  bill has not been passed by this esteemed body.  Let me say that again. Here is where  we are: in the midst of two wars, with  our brave sons and daughters, husbands  and wives fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014and I am the wife of a combat  veteran who served in Iraq\u2014with our  country facing a very serious threat  from radical Islamist terrorists, this  would be the first time in a half century in which we have not passed the  National Defense Authorization Act.  It would be shameful to not bring forward the Defense authorization bill to  the floor and to pass it, after robust debate, where Senators from both parties  can amend it, we can talk about it, and  we can let the American people know  what is in this bill.  I met  recently with  the  sergeant  major of the Marine Corps. Sergeant  Major Barrett shared with me the stories of  several marines  serving our  country. I cannot discuss all of them,  but I want to give a few examples. One  is Sergeant Ramirez, a squad leader assigned to the 1st Battalion 5th Marines  in Helmand Province in Afghanistan.  Sergeant Ramirez has a hook as a  left hand. In February of 2006 Sergeant  Ramirez  lost his hand when he was  wounded in action while serving in Iraq  with the 3rd Battalion 5th Marines.  Now he is leading patrols in Afghanistan. He wanted to go back and serve  our country. Talk about bravery. Talk  about courage.  There  is  also  Sergeant  Gill  at  Quantico  and Corporal Pacheco  at  Camp Pendleton  and  thousands  of  other soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who after being injured on the  battlefield have  continued  to  serve  their country. They are doing their  jobs with skill and courage in this 10th  year that our country is at war. I just  wish we would show half, even a quarter of the courage of our military men  and women in taking up the important  issues that need to be addressed to protect our country, and many of them  are addressed in this Defense Authorization Act.  That is why I am on the floor today.  I think it is so important this bill be  brought forward and we have a debate  over it; that we are allowed to amend  it and allowed to pass it to make sure  our military men and women know we  are fully behind them.  I know the majority leader has said if  we just drop the detainee provision in  the bill that he would bring forward  the Defense authorization bill. But this  is not how this body is designed to operate. If Senator REIDand the administration do not like the detainee provision in the bill, Senator REID should  move to amend it or vote against the  bill rather than prevent the entire Defense authorization from being considered. That is how the Senate is supposed to operate.  Of course, the irony is that in a place  where we rarely agree on anything, the  detainee provision that is holding up  this bill the administration has objected  to  actually  received  overwhelming support in the Armed Services Committee\u201425 out of 26 members  of  the Armed  Services  Committee  voted  for this detainee compromise.  That  rarely happens around here.  I  think it shows this was a thoughtful  compromise and that members of both  sides of the aisle worked hard to address this important issue.  This compromise was actually a compromise  put  together  by Chairman  LEVINof the committee, ranking member JOHNMCCAINof the committee, and  Senator LINDSEYGRAHAM, who also has  substantial experience in the Guard as  a Judge Advocate General attorney.  The overall Defense Authorization  Act passed out of the Armed Services  Committee 26 to 0. How often does that  happen around here, that every single  member of the Armed Services Committee from both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, and Senator  LIEBERMANan Independent, that we all  voted to pass this bill? Yet this bill  that is so important to our national security and to our warfighters is being  held up right now from being considered and brought to the floor.  In this era of partisanship, the American people want us to work together,  and that is what we did. As a result,  not a single member, as I mentioned,  voted against the final bill. That is not  to suggest that every member of the  Armed Services Committee got what  they wanted in that compromise. I was  someone who fought hard in the committee for the compromise to be tougher on terrorists.  But I respect that we came together  as colleagues to come to this compromise and to move forward on the  Defense Authorization Act so it could  be brought for full consideration for  every Member of the Senate. If the majority leader were to bring this compromise to the Senate according to  normal  and  well-understood  procedures, every Member of this Senate, including the majority leader and myself, would have the opportunity to debate it, to amend it, and to vote on the  Defense authorization bill,  including  the detainee compromise  I  just referenced.  I may be new around here, but I must  ask: Why  isn\u2019t  the majority  leader  bringing this  forward? I know he  is  clearly doing the administration\u2019s bidding on these detainee issues. But why  would he prevent the American people  from hearing this  important debate?  Why would giving terrorists greater  rights to our civilian detention and  court system, which seems to be the  administration\u2019s position, be more important  than  ensuring  that  our  warfighters have the right weapons and  equipment,  or  ensuring  that  our  wounded warriors get better access to  educational opportunities, and all of  the other important issues that are addressed  in the Defense authorization  bill related to both our national security and to our warfighters?  I believe those issues deserve to be  addressed by debating and passing this  bill. I also believe the American people  deserve to know all of the facts about  where we are with respect to our detention policy with terrorists.  I have to tell you, as a new member  of the Armed Services Committee during the last 8 months and having our  military leaders come before that committee, when I have asked them about  our detention policy and how we are  treating terrorists we have captured,  how we are gathering intelligence from  them, what we are doing to protect the  American people, I have been shocked  to learn that 27 percent of the terrorists we have released from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility have actually returned to the battle or we suspect have returned to the battle to  harm us and our allies.  Too many former Guantanamo Bay  detainees are now actively engaged in  terrorist activities and are trying to  kill Americans. Former Guantanamo  detainees are conducting suicide bombings, recruiting radicals, and training  them to kill Americans and our allies.  Said al-Shihri and Abdul Zakir represent two examples of former Guantanamo detainees who have returned to  the fight and have assumed leadership  positions  in  terrorist  organizations  that are dedicated to killing Americans and our allies.  Said al Shihri has worked as the No.  2 in al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.  Abdul Zakir  now  serves  as  a  top  Taliban military  commander and a  senior  leader  in the Taliban Quetta  Shura.  Can you  imagine having to tell a  mom or a dad that their son or daughter was killed in Afghanistan by a terrorist whom we released from Guantanamo Bay?  Given the facts, I understand why the  majority leader and the Obama administration don\u2019t want to talk about our  detention policy, but as John Adams  said,  facts are stubborn things. The  American people deserve to hear this  debate and to have us address this  issue through the Defense Authorization Act.  Under our Constitution, we have a  fundamental duty to protect the American people and  to provide  for our  warfighters.  We owe it to our military men and  women to take up the Defense Authorization Act right now. Majority Leader  REID, as the leader of this esteemed  body, should allow that to happen so  we can fulfill our responsibility to the  American people.  Let me conclude by urging the majority leader to bring the defense authorization bill forward for debate, for  amendment, and  for passage. In the  midst of two wars, it is time Congress  does  its  job  and  provides  for  our  warfighters and their needs.

They don\u2019t want the  government to exercise any power of  oversight, to police the ranks of those  in the financial industry who are not  dealing with this situation responsibly.  That is their position.  I happen to believe government has a  legitimate role. When those banks were  about to fail, they loved government.  They couldn\u2019t wait to get our money.  They got the money and survived and  then gave one another bonuses. The  government  said: Now you have  to  clean up your act, and they said: Get  out of the way. Government is nothing  but a big old problem.  The American people know better.  We want Wall Street and the big banks  to be held accountable. We never want  to go down this bailout road again, and  I think\u2014and I hope most Americans  believe\u2014that oversight of these banks  is absolutely essential to make sure we  have money available and these banks  are sound.  HEALTHCAREREFORM  The last point I will make relates to  the health care issue. I see my colleague from Colorado on the floor, and  I am happy to yield to him in just a  couple minutes.  The health care issue is one that is a  frequent source of conversation among  the political talking heads and elected  officials here in Washington. Recently,  many on the other side of the aisle  have been holding almost daily press  conferences\u2014one was reported today in  the Washington Post\u2014where they get  very worked up over the President\u2019s  health care reform bill, which I was  proud to support, and say it is the reason  for virtually  every problem  in  America.  Let me tell my colleagues on both  sides the reality. Having served on the  deficit commission, we cannot reduce  the deficit and the rate of growth in  our national debt without coming to  grips with  the cost of health care.  Whether it is a family, a business or  any level of government, the cost of  health care is breaking the bank. What  we tried to do, and I think we will do,  is to come up with a fair way to bring  down the rate of growth and the cost of  health care. I am not naive enough to  believe we are going to actually bring  down health care costs dramatically.  What we are trying to do is to slow  that rate of growth, and that is something we can achieve.  I take a look around at what we are  faced with when  it comes to health  care and the dilemmas we face, how  many people before this health care reform bill had virtually no protection.  One of the things we did in health care  reform, which  I  suppose  those who  want to repeal it want to get rid of,  was to say they couldn\u2019t penalize a person or a family because of preexisting  conditions. Children under the age of 18  could not be denied on a family policy  because  of  a  preexisting  condition.  Many parents, such as my own family,  have  lived  through  this  and  have  known that if we couldn\u2019t get basic  health insurance for our child, it could  jeopardize the quality of care that was  available. We changed that  law. We  said they cannot discriminate against  children under the age of 18 because of  preexisting conditions. We are moving  toward  eliminating  that discrimination across the board. Is that unreasonable? I think it is realistic and humane  and it is a good thing to do.  The second thing we did was to help  senior  citizens  getting  prescription  drugs under Medicare who get stuck  with something called the doughnut  hole. It is a gap in coverage of almost  $2,000 a year that they have to take out  of their savings accounts to pay for expensive prescription drugs. We are closing that hole over a period of a number  of years so seniors will have seamless  coverage, start to finish. That is part  of health care reform. Those who are  calling for its repeal ought to stand  and say exactly that they want to get  rid of that as well.  We also provide coverage under the  family health insurance plan for children up to the age of 26. It expands the  reach of family health insurance for recent high school and college graduates  who may not have a job. It is an important coverage factor that I am glad we  included in this bill.  There is more we need to do. But to  walk away from health care reform, to  walk away  from efforts  to preserve  quality and reduce the cost in health  care is a step in the wrong direction for  the quality of life of American families  and for dealing with this deficit challenge we face.  I sincerely hope my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle will consider  joining us in offering amendments and  modifications to the President\u2019s jobs  act. What is absolutely unacceptable is  to do nothing. Unfortunately, many of  them believe that is exactly what we  should do: Don\u2019t let government get involved in any respect when it comes to  the  unemployment  across America.  Whether it is unemployment benefits,  helping working families, giving incentives to small businesses to hire veterans and other people, putting money  into infrastructure in America\u2014these  are things we can and should do together as a nation to bring this economy forward and to reduce the unemployment we are currently facing.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Expressions of approval are not in order.  The Senator from Wyoming.  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, if I had  the time, I would contest a few things  my colleague from Illinois said, but I  am not going  to make a political  speech; I am going to speak on the bill  that  is currently before  the Senate  which is the China currency bill.  So I rise to speak on the China currency bill. China\u2019s undervaluation of  its currency is a serious problem. It is  an issue I studied when I was a member  of the Senate Banking Committee and  now as a member of the Finance Committee. Earlier this year, I also had an  opportunity to visit China with a number of my colleagues and learn more  about this issue as we met with their  government officials.  It is clear the efforts of the Chinese  Government  to  peg  its  currency  against the dollar give unfair benefits  to the Chinese exporters at the expense  of U.S. manufacturers. The United  States should take additional action to  pressure their government to reevaluate Chinese currency.  However, this is not a new problem.  China currency has been a priority for  both President George W. Bush and  President Obama. Through a number of  venues, including the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade talks, our  officials at all levels have raised this  issue with little response. This experience shows that action by the United  States alone is not enough. We know  other major global trading powers have  the same concern, but we continue to  act individually. Just this summer, the  German Government made a renewed  attempt to gain more flexibility in China\u2019s currency. The full European Union  has followed suit, but they, too, have  had little gain. But the United States  and the European Union are not the  only ones concerned about China currency. A number of emerging economies, including both India and Brazil,  have also made the same plea. So the  question I ask now is why are we considering a bill that puts the United  States in a position of going it alone?  That is one reason I am a cosponsor  of the Hatch amendment No. 680. This  substitute amendment retains the designations  included  in the underlying  bill that define a \u2018\u2018fundamentally misaligned currency\u2019\u2019 while giving direction to the administration to pursue  action through multilateral channels.  The amendment also thinks forward by  making the issue of currency misalignment a priority issue in both our current trade negotiations and in future  trade agreements. It is important that  the United States not act by  itself  when it comes to pressuring China on  this issue. I have found in my experience that when it comes to economic  policy in our globalized world, the multilateral approach is the most successful. That is one reason I do not support  imposing  unilateral  economic  sanctions on any nations. I am hopeful the  Senate will have an opportunity to  vote on and include the Hatch amendment in this bill.  I also wish to speak about an amendment I am working on with my colleague from Oregon, Senator MERKLEY.  Given that this bill is about enforcement of trade obligations, we filed an  amendment that would encourage our  officials to counternotify those nations  that have failed to report on the government subsidies that are provided to  industries  engaged  in  international  trade and in competition with us.

The Premier of  China is saying, if we have a fair currency rate, the Chinese would lose jobs.  Somebody is going to gain those jobs\u2014  maybe it will be in Dayton or maybe it  will be in Birmingham or Mobile.  As Mr. Chang says, and this puts it  on the line:  If China manipulates its currency to gain a  trade advantage, then Premier Wen is seeking to put American workers on the bread  line.  Not Chinese workers on the bread  line. Quoting the article further:  So Donald Trump hit the mark when he  tweeted last week that  \u2018\u2018China is stealing  our jobs.\u2019\u2019  I am not here trying to condemn  China. I am here saying we have failed  to aggressively defend our legitimate  national interests, and we need to do  that. I believe this legislation puts us  on that path.  I believe in trade. I expect to support  the Colombian trade bill as it comes  forward. I think it serves our national  interest. The Panamanian trade bill  serves our national interest and will  help us be more profitable. I believe  the  trade agreement we have negotiated with South Korea is also in our  national interest and will help us. But  this deal needs to be fixed. It is time to  stop it. It has gone on too long.  It is great to see my colleague, Senator BROWN. I know he will be ready to  talk as we move forward to final passage, but let me congratulate Senator  BROWNand Senator SCHUMERand others who have worked on the bill. I believe it is a reasonable piece of legislation, and it provides exits if something  dangerous were to occur. It gives discretion to the President to delay, even  stop, actions that might occur under  this process if it is damaging to the  United States, and it gives Congress a  chance to be involved in that process.  This is the right way to do it. If  someone has some better ideas, maybe  we can improve the bill. But fundamentally, I think it is a good piece of legislation that will do the job, and I am  proud to be a part of this bipartisan effort that has moved this  legislation  that will help create American  jobs  without expanding our debt.  I thank the Chair, and I yield the  floor.  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President,  I  rise to speak at this watershed moment  in the U.S.-China relationship. This is  a relationship that will affect our children\u2019s future. And how we manage this  relationship now will help determine  the long-term strength of our Nation.  Warren Buffett has an answer  for  anyone who questions America\u2019s  future.  As he said earlier this year:  The prophets of doom have overlooked the  all-important factor that is certain: Human  potential  is  far  from exhausted, and the  American system for unleashing that potential\u2014a system that has worked wonders for  over two centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a Civil War\u2014remains alive and effective . . . Now, as in 1776,  1861, 1932 and 1941, America\u2019s best days lie  ahead.  I agree.  America has the world\u2019s best universities, a tradition of brilliant entrepreneurship, and the drive and ingenuity  of our people.  We gave the world the light bulb, the  airplane, the Polio vaccine, the personal computer, and the Internet. We  have been the world\u2019s engine of innovation for more than a century.  But we cannot rest on our laurels. We  can and must rise to the challenge of  China. This is a challenge I recognized  long ago. That is why I led the effort to  grant permanent normal  trade  relations to China, so we could begin to get  China to play by the rules.  That is also why I have traveled to  China eight different times, to stress to  their leaders the importance of playing  by those rules.  China has grown explosively during  that time period. It is now the second-  largest economy in the world. And it  continues to expand.  China\u2019s growth presents real opportunities for American entrepreneurs and  workers. Over the last decade, our exports to China have increased by close  to 500 percent. That is eight times faster than the growth of our exports to  the rest of the world. China is now the  third-largest market in the world for  U.S. exports. And it is the number one  market for U.S. agricultural exports.  But we should not blind ourselves to  the very real challenges that China  also poses to American entrepreneurs  and workers. Too often, China seeks an  unfair  advantage  in  international  trade, including by manipulating the  value of its currency.  In my most recent trip to China last  November, I met with Vice President  Xi Jinping and other top leaders. We  discussed a broad range of issues.  On currency, my message was clear:  China needed to allow its currency to  appreciate more quickly to market levels. If not, the U.S. Congress  likely  would take up\u2014and pass\u2014currency legislation.  Since my trip, China has only allowed its currency to appreciate by 3  percent. The Chinese government continues to  intervene to keep  its currency significantly below its real market value. That is why I intend to support this bill.  I did not come to this decision lightly. I have never favored unilateral approaches. But the time has come to  take action.  And  the United  States  needs  a  thoughtful China policy that takes action on other fronts as well. The currency issue is only one of many problems  facing American companies  in  China.  The problem of intellectual property  theft in China is enormous. To cite but  one example, an astounding 80 percent  of the software  installed on Chinese  computers is pirated. That represents  an enormous lost opportunity for U.S.  software  companies, who  lead  the  world in innovation.  And China bars many of our exports  from entering its market at all. China  shuts out American beef exports entirely. And it imposes barriers that effectively prevent  the entry of U.S.  companies into its banking, insurance,  and telecommunications sectors.  So while this bill addresses an important piece of  the puzzle,  it  is not  enough for China to appreciate its currency. China can and must take action  to address  these other problems as  well.  Ultimately, though, America\u2019s future  as a great economic power will not be  dictated by what China does. It will be  dictated by what we do. It is about us.  It is about the principles that made  America great. It is about our freedom,  our  justice, our democracy, and the  will, creativity, and endurance of our  people. And it is about what we must  do to get our own house in order so  that we can continue to compete and  win on the global stage.  We must focus on policies and initiatives that encourage American entrepreneurship.  We must nurture and protect American  innovation, both at home and  abroad. That is why I introduced a bill  to strengthen the research and development tax credit and make it permanent.  We also must reform our Tax Code to  unleash new investment and make college more accessible. That  is why I  have been holding a series of Finance  Committee hearings to pave the way  for tax reform.  And we must work together to open  export markets  around  the world.  That\u2019s why  I  strongly  support  the  pending free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.  We  took  an  important  step  last  month to pave the way for these trade  agreements when we renewed trade adjustment assistance with a strong bipartisan vote. It is now time to approve the trade agreements themselves  so that American entrepreneurs, workers, farmers, and ranchers can unlock  the potential of these key export markets.  So as we debate this bill, let us not  forget that the currency issue is only  one of many challenges in our relationship with China. Let us also be mindful  of our larger challenges both at home  and abroad. And let us continue to nurture American entrepreneurship here  at home so that we remain the world\u2019s  engine of innovation.  As long as we do so, we can be sure  that, as always, America\u2019s best days lie  ahead.  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 14  million Americans are currently unemployed. The American people are resilient, strong and hard-working. If they  are given a fair shot, they will succeed.  Unfortunately, as the world keeps getting  flatter, as our global economy  grows, Americans are not always given  a fair shot.

            "87": "October 6, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S6317  So  even  though  perhaps  Senator  MERKLEYand Senator UDALLwere disappointed in my advocacy to not massively change these rules, I went along  hoping things would work out better.  What just took place is an effort to try  to expedite what goes on around here.  Am I 100 percent sure that I am right?  No. But I feel pretty comfortable with  what we have done. There has to be  some end to these dilatory tactics to  stop things. Cloture means end; it is  over with.  Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, who  has the floor?  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor still.  Mr. MCCONNELL.  I would  like to  also give my version, if I may, to the  distinguished Senator from Tennessee.  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.  Mr. REID. I yield to my friend, the  Republican leader, to respond to any  questions that the Senator from Tennessee may have.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without  objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. MCCONNELL. Yes. Let me, for  the benefit of our colleagues, explain  what, in fact, happened. It is not complicated.  It was pretty  clear, whether you  liked this bill or did not, it was going  to pass. You could tell that by cloture  on the motion to proceed with a very  large majority. So I do not think my  good friend the majority leader had to  worry about whether his bill was ultimately going to pass. The question was  whether there were going to be any  amendments at any point to the bill.  And my conference made a decision\u2014  actually against my best advice\u2014to go  on and invoke cloture on the bill after  we had no amendments. The reason we  had no amendments is because the majority leader used a device we have all  become too familiar with called filling  the tree, thereby allowing no amendments he does not approve. And he said  that we are open for amendments, but  what he means is this: We are open for  any amendment I approve. So he filled  the tree and, prior to cloture on the  bill, controlled whether any amendments would be allowed and chose not  to allow any, as a practical matter. So  against my best advice, my conference  decided to invoke cloture on the bill.  So we were moving to approving the  bill with no expression whatsoever.  So we have in the postcloture environment the motion to suspend, which  has not been abused by this minority\u2014  not been abused by this minority. The  majority  leader,  in effect, has overruled the Chair with a simple majority  vote and established the precedent that  even one single motion to suspend\u2014  even one\u2014is dilatory,  changing  the  rules of the Senate. And if you look  back at his bill, what we have had, in  effect, is no amendments before cloture, no motions to suspend after cloture, no expression on the part of the  minority at all.  I do not know why anybody should  act as though they were offended by  nongermane amendments. This is the  Senate. We do not have any rules of  germaneness. No, we do not. Any subject on any bill can be offered as an  amendment. We all know that.  The  fundamental problem here  is  that the majority never likes to take  votes. That is the core problem. And I  can remember, when I was the whip in  the majority, saying to my members  over and over again, when they were  whining about casting votes they did  not want to vote, that the price of  being in the majority is that you have  to take bad votes because in the Senate,  the minority  is entitled  to be  heard\u2014not entitled to win but entitled  to be heard. So that is the core problem.  I would say to my friend the majority leader\u2014and this is nothing personal  about him; I like him, and we deal with  each  other  every  day\u2014we  are  fundamentally turning the Senate into the  House: no amendments before cloture,  no motions to suspend after cloture,  and the minority is out of business.  And it is particularly bad on a bill that  has the support of over 60 Members, as  this one did. If you are not among  those 60, you are out of luck.  Now, look, this is a bad mistake. The  way you get business done in the Senate is to be prepared to take bad votes.  At some point, if 60 Members of the  Senate want a bill to pass, it will pass.  If 60 Members of the Senate do not  want a bill to pass, it will not pass. It  is more time consuming. I assume that  is why a lot of people ran for the Senate instead of the House\u2014because they  wanted to be able to express themselves. This  is a  free-wheeling body,  and everybody is better off when we operate that way. Everybody is, whether  you are in the majority or the minority, because today\u2019s minority may be  tomorrow\u2019s majority, and the country  is better off to have at least one place  where there  is extended debate and  where you have  to  reach a  supermajority to do things.  So I would say to my good friend the  majority leader that I understand his  frustration. But you were going to win  on this bill. You did not need to jam  us. You should not jam us on any bill,  but on this bill you were going to win.  Now, some of us think we were wasting  our time because, as the Senator from  Tennessee said, this was not going to  become law anyway, and we are sitting  around here when we ought to be passing trade bills.  The President has asked us to vote  on his jobs bill. I wanted to give him an  opportunity to have his vote the other  day. You guys did not even want to  vote on what the President was asking  us to vote on without any changes. But  you can prevent that, and you did.  Look,  let\u2019s not change this place.  America does not need less debate, it  needs more debate. And when 60 Members of the Senate decide to pass something, it will pass.  I think we made a big mistake tonight. As soon as we all kind of cool off  and think about it over the weekend, I  hope we will undo what we did tonight  because it is not in the best interests of  this institution or the American people.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate  should function like the Senate. I acknowledge that. But we have major  pieces of  legislation that have been  brought down as a result of not being  able to have finality of that legislation, unending amendments that are  not germane or relevant. The small  business  innovation  bill  that  had  passed in past years easily, we had the  Economic  Development  Administration bill that passed easily in the past,  job-creating bills on which we had an  open amendment process\u2014they were  simply stopped.  There are rules of germaneness in the  Senate. There are rules of germaneness  in the Senate. Let\u2019s think about these  amendments that I agreed to. There  are others I did not agree to, but there  are  amendments  that  I  agreed we  should have a vote on, not that I wanted to have a vote on them because they  had nothing to do with the underlying  bill\u2014nothing. There are rules of germaneness that that should be the case.  DeMint amendment,  right  to work;  Cornyn amendment, fighter planes to  Taiwan\u2014we already had a vote on that,  but we agreed to have another one;  Hatch amendment\u2014that one  is  relevant  and  it  is  germane; Barrasso  amendment,  cement\u2014not  so;  Paul,  Federal funding; Coburn, foreign aid;  McConnell, jobs act.  Part of cloture is enforcing germaneness. That is what it is all about. We  are happy to do germane amendments.  But the fact is, the Republican leader  himself decided not to have amendments on this bill. I agreed to amendments on the bill prior to cloture. Everybody probably does not know that;  they should because that is the way it  is.  So we have to make the Senate a better place, and I think a better place is  to do what was done tonight, to get rid  of these dilatory amendments. I mean,  we would be happy  if poor Senator  BINGAMAN could get some bills out of  the Energy Committee. We could do  something on cement. If we could get  some bills out of the Foreign Relations  Committee, we could maybe look at  foreign aid.  These things are dilatory and only  unnecessary, in an effort to divert from  what we are really trying to do here;  that is, legislate.  So the issue is this: I believe what we  did at the beginning of this Congress  was the right thing to do, but as the  weeks  and months have  rolled  on,  wasting months of our time on a CR  that was done\u2014on a series of CRs\u20141  week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks\u2014to fund the  government until October, a few days  ago\u2014what a waste of time.

            "95": "October 6, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S6325  One of the lessons of September 11th . . . is  that what happens overseas matters here at  home We face an enemy that can only recruit when they find hopeless people, and  there is nothing more hopeless to a child  who loses a mom or dad to AIDS to watch  the wealthy nations of the world sit back  and do nothing.  Former  Secretary  of  State  Condoleezza Rice was equally blunt  about the stakes involved. She said:  We don\u2019t have an option to retire, to take  a sabbatical from leadership in the international community and the world. If we do,  one of 2 things will happen. There will be  chaos, because without leadership there will  be chaos in the international community,  and that is dangerous. But it\u2019s quite possible, that if we don\u2019t lead, somebody else  will. And perhaps it will be someone who  does not share our values of compassion, the  rights of the individual, of liberty, and freedom.  I could not agree more, and I hope  other Senators appreciate what is at  stake. Just as past generations rallied  to meet the formidable challenges of  the Great Depression, the Nazis, and  the Cold War, we will bear responsibility if we fail to meet the challenges  of today.  The budget for diplomacy and development includes funding for our embassies and consulates that assist the millions of Americans who travel, study,  work and serve overseas.  It pays our contributions  to U.N.  peacekeeping missions that do not require the costly deployment of U.S.  troops, UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the International Atomic  Energy Agency, the operations of our  NATO security pact, aid for refugees  who have fled wars or natural disasters, and  to prevent  the  spread of  AIDS, the Asian Flu, and other contagious diseases that threaten Americans and people everywhere.  There are many other programs that  promote U.S. exports, support democratic elections, combat poverty, and  help  build  alliances with  countries  whose support we need in countering  terrorism, thwart drug trafficking, protect the environment, and stop cross-  border crime.  We do this and a lot more with less  than 1 percent of the Federal budget,  yet it is a crucial investment in our national security.  It also is no wonder that other countries\u2014our allies and our competitors\u2014  are spending more each year to project  their influence around the world, and  to compete in the global marketplace.  Great Britain\u2019s conservative government is on a path to increase its international development assistance to .7  percent of  its national budget, compared  to  .2 percent  for  the United  States. Yet the Republican majority in  the House of Representatives proposes  to slash funding for these programs to  pre-2008 levels.  Our  leadership  is being challenged  unlike at any time since the Cold War.  In Latin America, which is a larger  market for U.S. exports than any other  region except the European Union, our  market share is shrinking while China\u2019s is growing. It is the same story everywhere.  There is simply no substitute for U.S.  global leadership. The world is changing, and we cannot afford to retrench  or to succumb to isolationism. Funding  that enables us to engage with our allies,  competitors,  and  adversaries,  while an easy political target, helps us  to meet growing threats to our struggling economy and our national security.  I strongly support this budget and  have fought to protect it for years. I  also know there are competing needs  and that we have to eliminate waste.  We need to support what works, and  stop funding what does not. Too often,  government  bureaucracies  continue  funding programs that fail, and that  needs to stop. Billions of dollars provided to high priced contractors and  consultants for poorly conceived, wildly extravagant, unsustainable efforts  to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan have  been wasted or stolen. This has further  damaged the public\u2019s opinion of foreign  aid.  The bill that I and Senator GRAHAM  recommended  to  the Appropriations  Committee on September 21 and that  was reported by a bipartisan vote of 28\u2013  2  is $6 billion below the President\u2019s  budget request. It scales back most Department of State and U.S. Agency for  International Development operations  and programs and will force them to  significantly curtail planned expenditures.  But the House bill cuts far deeper,  and these are the cuts that President  Bush and Secretary Rice warned about.  There are unmistakable signs that our  global influence is already eroding. It  is not preordained  that  the United  States will remain the world\u2019s dominant power. As former Secretary Rice  said, \u2018\u2018if we don\u2019t lead, somebody else  will.\u2019\u2019  I doubt there is a single Member of  Congress who, if asked, would say they  don\u2019t care if the United States becomes  a second or third rate power. They expect the United States to lead, to build  alliances, to help American companies  compete successfully, and to protect  the interests and security of its citizens.  You can\u2019t have  it both ways. You  can\u2019t expect others to  follow  if you  can\u2019t lead, and you can\u2019t lead if you  don\u2019t pay your way. This budget is a  fraction of the Federal budget, yet it is  a far cry from what this country should  be investing.  We need to wake up, to stop acting  like these investments don\u2019t matter,  that the State Department isn\u2019t important, that the United Nations isn\u2019t important, that what happens in Brazil,  Russia, the Philippines, Somalia, or  other countries doesn\u2019t matter, and  that global threats to the environment,  public health and safety will somehow  be solved by others.  Our budget for foreign operations already has gone through deep budget  cuts, with more  to  come. But  the  American people deserve to be told  that slashing, disproportionate cuts to  these programs would have no appreciable  impact on the deficit, and  it  would end up costing our country far  more in the future.  f  2011 DAVIDSON INSTITUTE  FELLOWS  Mr.  GRASSLEY.  Mr.  President,  today,  I have  the great honor and  pleasure to recognize this year\u2019s Fellows for the Davidson Institute for Talent Development. This year, 18 young  people under the age of 18 have been  awarded scholarships of $50,000, $25,000,  or $10,000 for having demonstrated superior ability and achievement and  having completed a significant piece of  work in the areas of science, music, literature, mathematics, or technology. I  would like to take this time to introduce each of these scholars and the  various projects they have undertaken.  In the area of science, we have eight  young  students  with  remarkable  projects that have contributed to scientific progress. Among this group of  scholars  is Shalini Ramanan. A  17-  year-old young woman from Richland,  WA, Shalini Ramanan worked with a  natural dietary component of the spice  turmeric called BC to test its effectiveness  in  treating  cardiovascular diseases. Through cell migration assays  and western blot techniques, she discovered that BC inhibited platelet-derived  growth  factor  (PDGF)-induced  vascular smooth muscle cell migration  and  signaling. Using bioinformatics,  she identified target genes connected  with signaling pathways. PDGF-stimulated cell-migration and proliferation  are key pathological events in a variety  of  diseases  including  atherosclerosis and cancer. Her studies may  help design and characterize novel drug  molecules with clinical applications.  A  17-year-old  young man  from  Mahopac, NY, Jayanth Krishnan developed an approach to infer regulatory  mechanisms governing changes in gene  expression and identified possible proteins that induce cancer. By creating a  web interface that could predict transcription  factors  for  dis-regulated  genes, and mathematical models using  MATLAB, he was able to predict proteins that are correlated with certain  cancer  families. Using this  information, he calculated several combinations of drugs, for 60 different cancers,  that have the potential to counteract  the inducing agents and better guide  therapeutics.  Lucy Wang,  a  17-year-old  young  woman from Garnet Valley, PA, developed a predictive model to detect adolescent depression with an overall correct classification of 83.66 percent. Untreated depression is the No. 1 cause of  suicide and the third leading cause of  death among teenagers. Using factor  analysis and logistic regression, she focused on quantifying variables  that  may lead to adolescent depression, including  student  self-reported  experiences and demographics.

            "103": "October 6, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S6333  The Task Force recommended that  the FDA focus on improving its scientific knowledge of nanotechnology to  help ensure the agency\u2019s regulatory effectiveness, particularly with regard to  products not subject to premarket authorization requirements.  The FDA has already reviewed and  approved  some nanotechnology-based  products. In the coming years, they expect a significant increase in the use of  nanomaterials in drugs, devices, biologics, cosmetics, food, and over-the-  counter products. This will require the  FDA to devote more of its regulatory  attention  to  nanotechnology  based  products.  The FDA has already begun to devote  some resources to the understanding of  the human health effects and safety of  nanotechnology. The FDA has established a Nanotechnology Core Facility  at  the National  Center  for  Toxicological Research in Jefferson Arkansas.  In August, Arkansas Governor  Beebe and FDA Commissioner Hamburg  signed  a memorandum understanding creating a Virtual Center of  Excellence in regulatory science pertaining to nanotechnology. Under the  agreement,  the  state\u2019s  five  research  universities\u2014the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville; the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; the University of Arkansas at Little Rock; the  University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff,  and Arkansas State University\u2014will  work with the NCTR to establish a  nanotechnology collaborative research  program dealing specifically with toxicity. In addition, UAMS will offer a  Master\u2019s degree and a certification program in regulatory science.  Let me talk for a few minutes about  two areas where nanotechnology is already being applied to health care, the  early detection of cancer and multifunctional therapeutics.  The early detection of cancer can result  in  significant  improvement  in  human health care and reduction  in  cost. Nanotechnology offers important  new tools for detection where existing  and more  conventional  technologies  may  be  reaching  their  limits. The  present obstacle to early detection of  cancer lies in the inability of existing  tools to detect these molecular level  changes directly during early phases in  the genesis of a cancer. Nanotechnology can provide smart contrast agents  and tools for real time imaging of a  single cell and tissues at the nanoscale.  Nanotechnology promises a host of  minimally-invasive  diagnostic  techniques and much research is aimed at  ultra-sensitive labeling and detection  technologies.  In  the  in  vitro  area,  nanotechnology can help define cancers by molecular signatures denoting  processes  that  reflect  fundamental  changes in cells and tissues that lead  to cancer. Already, investigators have  developed  novel  nanoscale  in  vitro  techniques that can analyze genomic  variations across different tumor types  and distinguish normal from malignant  cells.  In the in vivo area, one of the most  pressing needs in clinical oncology is  for imaging agents that can identify  tumors that are  far smaller than  is  possible  with  today\u2019s  technology.  Achieving this level of sensitivity requires  better  targeting  of  imaging  agents and generation of a larger imaging signal, both of which nanoscale devices are capable of accomplishing.  Perhaps the greatest near-term impact  of multifunctional  therapeutic  compounds will come in the area of  tumor targeting and cancer therapies.  Nanotechnology can be used to develop  new methods of drug delivery that better target selected tissues and cells,  and to  improve on the efficiency of  drug activity in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Drug delivery applications will  provide a solution to solubility problems, as well as offer intracellular delivery possibilities.  The introduction of nanotechnology  to multifunctional therapeutics is at  an early stage of development. The delivery  of  nanoscale multifunctional  therapeutics could permit very precise  site specific targeting of cancer cells.  More  sophisticated  \u2018\u2018smart\u2019\u2019  systems  for drug delivery still have to be developed that sense and respond to specific  chemical agents and are tailored to  each patient. Multifunctional  therapeutic devices need to be developed  that simultaneously detect, diagnose,  treat and monitor response to the therapy. For  example, various nanomaterials can be made to link with a drug,  a targeting molecule and an imaging  agent to seek out cancers and release  their payload when required.  In conclusion,  the Nanotechnology  Regulatory Science Act of 2011 will  provide the FDA the authority necessary to scientifically study the safety and effectiveness of nanotechnology-based  drugs,  delivery  systems,  medical devices, orthopedic implants,  cosmetics, and food additives regulated  by the agency. This bill is a sound investment on the promise of nanotechnology to improve human health and  reduce costs in the 21st century.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 1662  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

            "111": "October 6, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S6341  Protection, or CBP, was a controversial decision.  I have long been concerned that the  transfer resulted in significant disruptions to the agriculture mission and  undermined the effectiveness of agricultural inspections. Other Members of  Congress have expressed similar concerns, and there have even been efforts  to remove agricultural inspection responsibilities from the Department of  Homeland Security and return them to  the Department of Agriculture.  While I understand these sentiments,  as Chairman of the Subcommittee on  Oversight of Government Management,  I understand that such drastic reorganizations are often costly and disruptive.  In  light of our Nation\u2019s  fiscal  challenges, I have concluded it is most  efficient  and  effective  to  focus  on  strengthening the agricultural inspection mission within CBP, which in recent  years,  has made meaningful  progress in stabilizing the agency\u2019s agricultural import and entry inspection  operations.  The Safeguarding American Agriculture Act seeks to build upon these  gains  and  fully  achieve  important  measures of success identified in the  June 2007 Report of the APHIS-CBP  Joint Task Force on Improved Agriculture Inspection, which stated \u2018\u2018Success will be accomplished when the agriculture function within CBP is positioned prominently throughout the organization. The potential introduction  of plant and animal pest and diseases  will be regarded with the same fervor  as all other mission areas within CBP.\u2019\u2019  The Act would enhance the priority  of, and accountability  for, the agriculture mission by establishing within  CBP an Office of Agriculture Inspection led by an Assistant Commissioner  responsible for improving agricultural  inspections across  the Nation. This  provision would improve efficiency and  coordination by unifying agriculture  policy development with agriculture  operations. An agricultural chain of  command that extends from the Assistant Commissioner for Agriculture Inspection to frontline agriculture specialists at the ports would also effectively address a key  issue the task  force  identified  in  its  2007  report:  \u2018\u2018Management  and  leadership  infrastructure  supporting  the agriculture  mission in CBP should be staffed and  empowered  at  levels  equivalent  to  other  functional mission  areas  in  CBP.\u2019\u2019  Under  the  present  organizational  structure, the Deputy Executive Director  for CBP\u2019s office of Agriculture  Operational Oversight within the office  of Agriculture Programs and Trade Liaison, which falls under the Office of  Field Operations, is responsible for improving oversight of the agricultural  mission across all CBP field offices by  ensuring a more consistent application  of agriculture inspection policy. However, the Deputy Executive Director  lacks operational authority over the  agriculture mission. Moreover, the dissemination and implementation of agricultural policy at the ports is ultimately at the discretion of CBP Officers who typically do not have agriculture expertise and are primarily focused on the critical mission of preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the country.  To maintain a highly skilled and motivated  agriculture  specialist workforce, the Act would require CBP to  create  a  comprehensive  agriculture  specialist career track that identifies  appropriate career paths and ensures  that agriculture specialists receive the  training, experience, and assignments  necessary  for  successful career. The  bill also would require CBP to develop  plans to improve agriculture specialist  recruitment and retention and to make  sure agriculture specialists have the  necessary equipment and resources to  effectively carry out their mission.  To strengthen critical working relationships and promote interagency experience, the Act would authorize the  Secretary of Homeland Security and  the Secretary of Agriculture to establish an interagency rotation program  for CBP and APHIS personnel.  Taken  together,  the enhancements  contained in the Safeguarding American Agriculture Act of 2011 would elevate the stature of the agriculture mission in CBP to match the magnitude of  the challenge posed by invasive pests  and disease. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 1673  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

RES. 288  Whereas in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt established the first national wildlife  refuge on Florida\u2019s Pelican Island;  Whereas in 2011, the National Wildlife Refuge System, administered by the Fish and  Wildlife Service, is the premier system of  lands and waters to conserve wildlife in the  world, and has grown to more than 150,000,000  acres, 553 national wildlife refuges, and 38  wetland management districts in every State  and territory of the United States;  Whereas national wildlife refuges are important recreational and tourism destinations in communities across the Nation, and  these protected lands offer a variety of recreational opportunities, including 6 wildlife-  dependent uses that the National Wildlife  Refuge System manages: hunting,  fishing,  wildlife observation, photography, environmental education, and interpretation;  Whereas more than 370 units of the National Wildlife Refuge System have hunting  programs and more than 350 units of the National Wildlife Refuge System have fishing  programs,  averaging more  than  2,500,000  hunting visits and more than 7,100,000 fishing  visits;  Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences 28,200,000 wildlife observation visits annually;  Whereas national wildlife refuges are important  to  local businesses and gateway  communities;  Whereas  for every  $1 appropriated, national wildlife refuges generate $4 in economic activity;  Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences approximately 45,700,000 visits  every  year,  generating  nearly  $1,700,000,000 and 27,000 jobs in local economies;  Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System encompasses every kind of ecosystem in  the United States,  including  temperate,  tropical,  and  boreal  forests,  wetlands,  deserts, grasslands, arctic tundras, and remote islands, and spans 12 time zones from  the Virgin Islands to Guam;  Whereas national wildlife refuges are home  to more than 700 species of birds, 220 species  of mammals, 250 species of reptiles and amphibians, and more than 1,000 species of fish;  Whereas national wildlife refuges are the  primary Federal lands that foster production, migration, and wintering habitat for  waterfowl;  Whereas since 1934, more than $750,000,000  in funds, from the sale of the Federal Duck  Stamp to outdoor enthusiasts, has enabled  the purchase or lease of more than 5,300,000  acres of waterfowl habitat in the National  Wildlife Refuge System;

 Whereas national wildlife refuges provide  an important opportunity for children to discover and gain a greater appreciation for the  natural world;  Whereas because there are national wildlife refuges located in several urban and suburban areas and 1 refuge located within an  hour\u2019s drive of every metropolitan area in  the United States, national wildlife refuges  employ, educate, and engage young people  from  all  backgrounds  in  exploring,  connecting with, and preserving the natural heritage of the Nation;  Whereas since 1995, refuges across the Nation have held  festivals, educational programs, guided tours, and other events to celebrate National Wildlife Refuge Week during  the second full week of October;  Whereas the Fish and Wildlife Service will  continue to seek stakeholder input on the  implementation of the recommendations in  the document entitled \u2018\u2018Conserving the Future: Wildlife Refuges and the Next Generation\u2019\u2019, which is an update to the strategic  plan of the Fish and Wildlife Service for the  future of the National Wildlife Refuge System;  Whereas the week beginning on October 9,  2011, has been designated as \u2018\u2018National Wildlife Refuge Week\u2019\u2019 by the Fish and Wildlife  Service;  Whereas  in 2011, the designation of National Wildlife Refuge Week would recognize  more than a century of conservation in the  United States and would  serve  to  raise  awareness about the importance of wildlife  and the National Wildlife Refuge System and  to celebrate the myriad recreational opportunities available to enjoy this network of  protected lands: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the Senate\u2014  (1) designates the week beginning on October 9, 2011, as  \u2018\u2018National Wildlife Refuge  Week\u2019\u2019;

ROSKAM  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 6, 2011  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  highlight the good work of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund.  The  Juvenile  Diabetes  Research  Fund  began in 1970 from a parent\u2019s idea to begin  a  fundraising effort with  the aim  to promote  the research of a cure for juvenile diabetes.  To date,  the organization has  raised more  than $1.5 billion,  including $107 million  last  year alone. More  than 80 percent of  those  funds go directly to support research and research-related education.  JDRF now has over 100 locations around  the world and currently funds research in 19  countries.  Diabetes and  its  complications  cost  the  United States more than $174 billion a year  and it is a growing epidemic. Every year, there  are roughly 30,000 new cases of Type-1 diabetes discovered  in America and more  than  1.6 million cases of diabetes are diagnosed  every year. That\u2019s one every 30 seconds.  Type-1 Diabetes  typically  affects  young  adults and children. They are  forced at a  young age to learn how to monitor their blood  levels and inject insulin when it\u2019s low. This can  also be a worrisome and anxious experience.  This is why we must encourage the Food  and Drug Administration to continue in its approval process for the artificial pancreas. Earlier this year, 60 Senators and 250 Representatives sent a letter to the FDA Commissioner  Margaret Hamburg expressing  their support  for the artificial pancreas.  This new device will allow children to return  to their lives and give parents the peace of  mind in knowing that their children will not forget to check their insulin levels. The artificial  pancreas  is a device  that can automatically  monitor and regulate glucose levels without requiring blood to be drawn.  Jeffrey Brewer, President  and CEO  of  JDRF,  said,  \u2018\u2018An artificial pancreas, which  would automatically monitor and regulate glucose levels, has the potential to transform the  care of people with type 1 diabetes.\u2019\u2019 It estimated the artificial pancreas could save Medicare $23 million over 10 years and $1.9 billion  over 25 years by lowering the number of complications associated with the disease.  I am hopeful that the FDA will stick to its  publicly announced December 2011 draft guidance deadline. This will allow us to move into  the crucial next phase of real world testing of  this potentially life saving device. I would urge  my colleagues to continue to monitor this situation and ensure that the FDA stays true to  their word on the guidance.  There may not be a cure for diabetes yet  but with organizations like the JDRF leading  the way in encouraging research and funding  grant programs we are getting closer to a cure  each day.  f  RECOGNIZING THE  446TH AIRLIFT  WING  FOR  EARNING  THE AIR  FORCE  MERITORIOUS  UNIT  AWARD  HON. ADAM SMITH  OFWASHINGTON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 6, 2011  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to recognize the 446th Airlift Wing  for earning  the Air Force Meritorious Unit  Award. The award  reflects  the wing\u2019s outstanding  performance  flying  combat  and  peacetime missions between 2008 and 2010.  The 446th Airlift Wing is Washington State\u2019s  only Air Force Reserve  flying unit and performs roughly 44 percent of all C\u201317 missions  leaving McChord Field located on Joint Base  Lewis-McChord. Having won this accolade in  2007, this honor marks the second time the  446th Airlift Wing has earned the Meritorious  Unit Award.  The Meritorious Unit Award was established  in 2004 to recognize organizations for exceptional achievement or service in direct support  of combat operations. The 2,100 airmen who  make up the 446th Airlift Wing are honored for  contributing directly to national objectives and  continuously demonstrating their combat readiness as  they  fulfilled global peacetime and  wartime operations. Flying more  than 9,700  missions  in more  than 42,000  flying hours  averaging 2,000 missions every four months  to 11 different Iraqi airfields proves that this  unit is nothing short of exemplary.  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize the  446th for its performance and its commitment  to serving the United States. I ask that my colleagues  in  the House  of Representatives  please join me in congratulating the 446th Airlift Wing for receiving the Air Force Meritorious  Unit Award.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF REVEREND  FRED L. SHUTTLESWORTH  HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 6, 2011  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  an  instrumental  figure  in  the Civil Rights  Movement, Reverend Fred L. Shuttlesworth.  Reverend Shuttlesworth passed away at  the  age of 89.  Born in Montgomery County, Alabama, Reverend Shuttlesworth was no stranger  to  frequent discrimination and violence as he lived  out his  life. Having endured countless beatings,  bombings,  and  arrests,  Reverend  Shuttlesworth would become a leading force in  the historic fight for equal rights.  Reverend Shuttlesworth was one of the primary pillars of the iconic \u2018\u2018Big Three,\u2019\u2019 founded  conjointly with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  and Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, and others.  While Reverend Shuttlesworth may not have  been as much of a household name as Dr.  King,  for example, his contributions  to  the  Movement were irrefutably just as pivotal to its  success.  Reverend Shuttlesworth was a major actor  in  the  formation of  the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference, SCLC, a civil rights  organization that helped to mobilize thousands  of people during  rallies and protests  in  the  name of equality. He also helped to organize  the Freedom Rides through his work with the  Congress on Racial Equality, CORE. Also  known for his outspoken and aggressive advocacy, Reverend Shuttlesworth worked closely  with Dr. King to maintain momentum behind  the Movement whenever Dr. King\u2019s conciliatory approach may have  failed. Today, his  contributions  remain clear and his personal  sacrifices revered.  Mr. Speaker, I am deeply saddened by this  tremendous loss. Reverend Shuttlesworth was  a well-respected and principled individual who  was fearless even in the face of insurmountable odds. Reverend Shuttlesworth selflessly  endured great personal sacrifice so  that he  could perpetuate a movement that went well  beyond his own life. For that I rise to honor his  lasting contributions to this nation.  f  A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT  OF U.S. POLICY TOWARD SUDAN  HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 6, 2011  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker,  earlier this week, the Subcommittee on Africa,  Global Health, and Human Rights, which  I  chair, held a hearing  that examined a wide  range of  issues  involving U.S. policy  toward  Sudan,  including  the  ongoing  attacks  on  Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states, the  continuing negotiations with  the Republic of  South Sudan on challenges such as the demarcation of the border, the fate of the Abyei  region, citizenship  in both countries and oil  revenue sharing. Additionally, this hearing provided opportunities  to receive an update on  the U.S. response to the enduring stalemate  on Darfur and to examine U.S. policy on the  release of Sudanese still held  in bondage  throughout Sudan.  Two months ago, the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights held an  emergency hearing on the attacks by the Republic of  the Sudan on  its own Southern  Kordofan state. The crisis first arose in June,  shortly after  the military  forces of  the Khartoum government attacked the disputed Abyei  area. This was apparently a provocation to the  Sudanese People\u2019s Liberation Movement, or  SPLM, government  in what  is now South  \u2211 This \u2018\u2018bullet\u2019\u2019 symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

Turkish hostility  towards Israel goes well beyond the purported  settling of a score over the Gaza Flotilla incident.  It appears calculated  to establish Turkey\u2019s strategic dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean by putting pressure on the Israeli-  American alliance. One important way for the  United States to discourage this kind of adventurism in the region is to continue to affirm  its unbreakable bond with the State of Israel.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE  MEDITERRANEAN QUARTERLY  HON. DONALD M. PAYNE  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 6, 2011  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  in  honor of the Mediterranean Quarterly, a journal of global issues published by Duke University Press in the late in 1980s. Mediterranean  Quarterly is edited by Dr. Nikolaos A. Stavrou  (Professor Emeritus of  International Affairs,  Howard University), a true believer in intellectual honesty, professional  integrity, and  fair  play. The Journal is unique in many ways, and  has made its mark in the policymaking world  and global academy.  Dr. Stavrou ensured that thinkers from all littoral states as well as academic experts in the  U.S. have an open and uncensored forum to  present  and  debate  ideas. Mediterranean  Quarterly has no agenda  to promote other  than the search for truth without fear or favor.  But more importantly, it has made a point to  open its pages to prominent African leaders to  address issues in true Mediterranean spirit of  respect for human dignity.  Over the years, I had the privilege of joining  a  stellar  list of  contributors, among  them  former President Jimmy Carter,  former UN  Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghalli, the  Presidents of Turkey and Croatia, President  Salva Kiir of South Sudan, and a long list of  academics, foreign ministers, prime ministers  and prominent diplomats.  I consider it my distinct honor to have published on a wide range of issues, including Africa, the Cyprus crisis and other issues. The  Mediterranean Quarterly is a forum for thinkers and not a place for waging an ideological  campaign.  f  HONORING THE REVEREND  JOSEPH E. LOWERY  HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND  OFLOUISIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 6, 2011  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker,  the Reverend Joseph E. Lowery, an irreplaceable organizer  in  the American Civil Rights Movement and a leader who marched with Rev. Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr. to overturn discrimination in voting rights and other injustices, celebrates his 90th birthday today. It is only right  that I honor this man who made my ascension  possible.  Just 54 years ago, in a meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana, Rev. Lowery helped form the  Southern Christian  Leadership Conference  alongside Dr. King, Rev. Ralph Abernathy,  and New Orleans\u2019 own Rev. Dr. Simmie Lee  Harvey and Rev. Abraham Lincoln  \u2018\u2018A. L.\u2019\u2019  Davis\u2014among other civil rights leaders. The  Southern Christian  Leadership Conference,  known as the SCLC, was largely known for its  non-violent protests. It was Rev. Lowery himself who organized the 1965 Selma to Montgomery March that eventually led to the passage of the historic Voting Rights Act. You\u2019ll  remember  that  the Voting Rights Act  finally  guaranteed Black Americans  the  right  to  vote\u2014free  from  intimidation, poll  taxes, and  other rules and  laws designed  to disenfranchise us. Rev. Lowery served as the president  of the SCLC from 1977\u20131997 and revitalized  it  through his outspoken nature and distinct  leadership style.  Rev. Lowery continues to fight social injustice even today at the young age of 90. For  his work, he\u2019s received numerous awards including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the  nation\u2019s highest civilian honor;  the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation\u2019s Phoenix  Award; the Martin Luther King Center Peace  Award;  the NAACP  Lifetime Achievement  Award; and the Fred L. Shuttlesworth Human  Rights  Award  from  the  Birmingham Civil  Rights  Institute. Rev. Lowery has also  received several honorary doctorates from colleges and universities including, Dillard University, Morehouse College, Alabama State University, University of Alabama  in Huntsville,  and Emory University.  While delivering the benediction at the 2009  presidential inauguration of President Obama,  Rev. Lowery reminded us all \u2018\u2018that in the complex arena of human relationships, we should  make choices on the side of love, not hate; on  the side of inclusion, not exclusion; and tolerance, not intolerance.\u2019\u2019 It is evident that this  principle has been a driving  force  in every  area of Rev. Lowery\u2019s  life  for  the  last 90  years. His unwavering dedication  to equality  for all people has made this country a better  place for people of all races and ethnicities.  As we celebrate  the  life of Rev. Lowery  today, we must also pause to remember the  legacy of another civil rights leader, Rev. Fred  Shuttlesworth. Rev. Shuttlesworth died yesterday at the age of 89 after fighting for racial  equality alongside Rev. Lowery for more than  50 years. He was an American hero whose  fight for civil rights is emblematic of the perseverance, compassion, and faith that make us  American. He was a legend during the movement and time has only cemented his place in  history as a champion of equality. He was  beaten,  threatened, and his  family was attacked. Nonetheless, he never wavered from  his commitment  to American civil rights. My  achievements have been possible because I  stand on his shoulders, Rev. Lowery\u2019s shoulders, and those of other freedom fighters. Dr.  King once referred to Rev. Shuttlesworth as  \u2018\u2018one of the nation\u2019s most courageous freedom  fighters.\u2019\u2019 It is because of this courage that his  legacy will  live on  for many generations  to  come.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join  me in wishing Rev. Joseph Lowery a happy  and blessed 90th birthday. As Rev. Lowery  once wrote of Dr. King, \u2018\u2018To appropriately celebrate . . . we must honor both the man and  the movement. To ennoble the man and ignore the movement is to do injustice to both.  We must not let the spirit of the movement be  overcome with sentimental ceremonies  that  omit  the sacramental nature of  the struggle.  Ceremonies end with  the benediction while  sacraments begin with the benediction. Ceremony is like putting a ring on her finger at the  wedding. Sacrament  is  ringing her  life with  love and joy ever after.\u2019\u2019  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO BEN AND  JENNIFER MOORE FOR WINNING  TENNESSEE  FARM  BUREAU\u2019S  OUTSTANDING YOUNG  FARMER  ACHIEVEMENT AWARD  HON.

LINDA T. SA\u00b4NCHEZ  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 6, 2011  Ms. LINDA T. SA\u00b4NCHEZ of California. Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to recognize October as  National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. To  raise awareness for breast cancer prevention,  I want  to stress  the  importance of  regular  mammograms  and  following  recommended  screening guidelines.  Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed  form of cancer  in women worldwide.  Every two minutes a woman is diagnosed with  breast cancer in the U.S. alone. Every thirteen  minutes, a woman dies of breast  cancer.  While  these statistics are shocking,  there  is  hope.  The 2.5 million breast cancer survivors  in  the U.S. today have shown that early detection and timely treatment are the keys to fighting the disease. The five-year survival rate for  women who are diagnosed at the early stage  of the disease\u2019s development has risen to 98  percent. It is undeniable that early detection  saves lives.  Unfortunately,  despite what we  already  know, the number of women receiving regular  mammograms has declined  in  the past  ten  years. A recent study discovered  that  fewer  than 50 percent of women over the age of 40  with health  insurance had  received a  recommended annual mammogram. This must  change.  In honor of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I want to encourage women to  follow the recommended screening guidelines.  I hope  this message reaches every woman,  and together we can commit to ending breast  cancer forever.  HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. RAZA  DILAWARI  HON. STEVE COHEN  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 6, 2011  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor the life of Dr. Raza Ali Dilawari, a great  Memphis surgeon known for his work in the  field of oncology. He was born in the Walled  City of Lahore, Pakistan and completed medical school there at King Edward Medical College in 1968. He then completed his surgical  residency at SUNY Upstate Medical Center in  Syracuse, New York and his surgical oncology  fellowship at  the University of Rochester at  Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New  York and the Roswell Park Memorial Institute  in Buffalo, New York. Dr. Dilawari then went  on to spend 35 years in Memphis serving the  community as a doctor, teacher and mentor,  touching thousands of lives in the process.  Dr. Dilawari was appointed Assistant Professor of  the Department of Surgery at  the  University of Tennessee Center  for Health  Sciences in Memphis in 1978. He became the  Assistant Dean  for Clinical Affairs  there as  well as Vice Chairman of the Department of  Surgery at Methodist University Hospital. His  time  in academia  left a great  legacy of research and peer-reviewed publications, but arguably his most  significant  contribution  to  Memphis was his mentoring of medical students and  the  training of over 200 surgical  residents, ensuring his lasting impact and legacy. His focus and dedication to training the  next generation of doctors and surgeons will  have a lasting impact on patients in Memphis  and around the world.  In addition to his great work as a teacher,  Dr. Dilawari opened a surgical oncology practice at the Regional Medical Center and Methodist Central Hospital in Memphis. His surgical  practice allowed him to operate on thousands  of patients over the years, often without regard  to payment. Dr. Dilawari was also very active  in his community as a founding member of the  Al Rasool Center and through his work with  the Islamic Society of Memphis. Dr. Dilawari  was a gracious and kind man who, until the  end of his life, maintained the good nature and  wisdom he had gained from years of treating  cancer patients.  Dr. Raza Dilawari passed away on September 18, 2011, at 64 years of age. The  Memphis community mourns the loss of one  of its great citizens. He is survived by his beloved family: his wife Bushra A. Dilawari, his  five children Asma, Amina, Mariam, Asad and  Saba, his granddaughter Zara as well as a  host of other family and friends across Tennessee and the world. We are grateful to have  had the pleasure of his dedication, skill and  compassion  in  the Memphis community. His  was a life well-lived.  Breast Cancer Awareness Month. This month  we stand together with those who have bravely  faced  this disease, as well as  to  raise  awareness toward finding a cure.  I am proud to wear this pink ribbon pin in  support of National Breast Cancer Awareness  Month and  to  recognize  the  importance of  early detection  in an effort  to eradicate  this  disease,  includin  encouraging women  and  men to follow recommended screening guidelines. Furthermore, we must make certain that  every woman has access to regular mammography screenings.  For more than 20 years, the observance of  National Breast Cancer Awareness Month  each October has provided a time for us all to  reflect on loved ones who have won and lost  the battle against breast cancer.  Every two minutes, a woman is diagnosed  with breast cancer, and every thirteen minutes  one woman will die of breast cancer  in  the  United States. In Florida alone, an estimated  15,330 new cases of invasive breast cancer  will be diagnosed in women in 2011 and 2,690  of  these women will die  from  this disease.  These statistics are some of  the many reasons I am a supporter of legislation and action  that aids the fight to end breast cancer. I have  also signed the National Breast Cancer Coalition\u2019s Congressional Declaration of Support for  Breast Cancer Deadline 2020. By declaring  my support to end breast cancer by January  1, 2020, I am proud to commit to continuing to  educate myself and my constituents about the  issues surrounding breast cancer.  Unfortunately,  today we see a decline  in  screening rates. A recent study of 1.5 million  women  found  that of  those over  the age of  forty, with health insurance, less than fifty percent had received  the recommended annual  screening. The key to ending this disease is  early detection, which reduces costs associated with  the disease. The costs  for early  stage  treatment are estimated at approximately $22,350 per person, while late stage  treatment costs nearly $120,000 per person.  Early detection of this life threatening disease  is crucial  to saving  lives and ultimately  reduces the burden on patients and our health  system.  There are 2.5 million breast cancer survivors living in the U.S. today. They are the  embodiment of bravery, as well as to the importance of promoting awareness about breast  cancer, following recommended guidelines, offering  treatment  to  those affected, and continuing to fund groundbreaking research.  Mr. Speaker, I commend those advocates,  survivors, and men and women who fight the  disease every single day. In honor of National  Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I encourage  everyone to make a renewed commitment to  following  recommended screening guidelines  and I will continue the effort here in Congress  to  eradicate  breast  cancer  by  supporting  breast health awareness, education, research,  screening and referrals.  f  f  RECOGNIZING NATIONAL BREAST  CANCER AWARENESS MONTH  CELEBRATING  THE  DEDICATION  OF THE JEWISH CHAPLAINS MEMORIAL  HON.

Mr. President,  I  come to the floor today to talk about  the Environmental Protection Agency,  the EPA, and their  implementing a  cap-and-trade  program  for what  is  called cross-State air pollution. I oppose this new regulation and I support  the resolution of disapproval that we  will be voting on later today.  Led by the EPA, Washington bureaucrats are tying up America with redtape. They are tying up our Nation and  they are tying up the American people.  This year alone, the EPA has issued  over 400  final rules. These are rules  that do have the effect of law. Well,  that is over two rules per day so far  this year for each day the Federal Register has been open for business in 2011.  Imagine any business in the United  States,  in our home  communities\u2014  businesses having to comply with two  new EPA rules each day you are open  for business. And, of course,  if you  don\u2019t comply, then you face thousands  of dollars in fines. This is business as  usual for the EPA. Thousands of rules  are filling the Federal Register, 70,000  pages this year alone. The costs of  rules issued this year are estimated to  eclipse the $100 billion mark. It is time  to stop Washington bureaucrats. They  are issuing excessive rules without considering their impact on our economy.  The problem is that this administration does not believe there is a regulations problem. They think more regulations actually create jobs rather than  harm  jobs. Fortunately,  a  previous  Congress passed, and President Clinton  signed into law, what is called the Congressional Review Act. This law gives  us our best tool to dismantle bad regulations, and we should use it when appropriate.  Majority Leader REID, one of the authors of this Congressional Review Act,  described the process as a reasonable,  sensible approach to regulatory reform.  I believe the Senate should use it here  today. The Senate should take back  some responsibility, instead of letting  unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats  continue to harm our economy.  I am standing here today to support  Senator RANDPAUL\u2019s resolution to nullify the EPA\u2019s cross-State air pollution  rule. The EPA\u2019s cross-State air pollution rule was finalized approximately 3  months  ago.  It  is  already  costing  Americans jobs. Over the summer, officials at a Texas utility threw up their  hands and  said  they  can\u2019t  comply.  They said it was too costly, too burdensome, and 500 jobs in Texas were  lost as a result. The EPA\u2019s own estimates say another 2,500 jobs will be  lost because of this very regulation.  Private sector analysis puts the  job  and cost numbers much higher.  The cross-State air pollution  rule  puts  limits on electricity generation  for over half the country.  It  forces  Washington\u2019s heavy hand on over 1,000  coal, gas, and oil-fired facilities across  28  States.  Originally  designed  for  States in the East, the EPA now continues to expand the rule to capture  more and more States in the West. The  newest version of the rule imposes new  requirements  for Kansas, Oklahoma,  Nebraska, Texas, Iowa, Missouri, and  Wisconsin. The compliance costs are  very high. By the EPA\u2019s own estimate,  the rule will cost over $2.4 billion.  The EPA also notes that part of these  costs will be passed on to U.S. households in the form of higher electricity  rates. The  cross-State air pollution  rule  demonstrates  how  bureaucrats  simply do not understand how job creators work and operate  their businesses all across this country.  The  implementation  timeline  the  EPA has proposed is nearly impossible  to follow. The rule was finalized on August 8, which leaves less than 6 months  for companies and States to act and  meet the new mandates by January of  2012. The Office of Management and  Budget even warned that there would  be  consequences  of  such  a  drastic  change in such a short amount of time.  In conclusion, this resolution of disapproval will tell the bureaucrats to do  their job but do it following the rules  of the road. We all want clean air, and  we want it done in a responsible way.  This EPA  is  rushing  through  rules,  causing a train wreck in our economy,  our jobs, and our competitiveness as a  nation will suffer as a result. Senator  PAUL\u2019s resolution will save at  least  3,000 American jobs and also prevent a  rise in electricity costs for American  families. By adopting this resolution  today, we will help our job creators,  and help them be more competitive in  the global marketplace. It is common  sense to rein in the EPA.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have  great respect for my colleague who just  spoke but disagree with him, and I urge  my colleagues to take a careful look at  the Rand  Paul  resolution  of  disapproval when it comes to this issue of  air pollution. I would commend the remarks of our colleague Senator KELLY  AYOTTEof New Hampshire who spoke  this Tuesday on the floor of the Senate, urging  the  same opposition  to  RANDPAUL\u2019s resolution. She said she  could not support that resolution. I  quote  from Senator AYOTTE\u2019s  floor  statement:  The cross-State air pollution rule is designed to control emissions of air pollution  that cause air quality problems in downwind  States, and New Hampshire is a downwind  State.  PAUL She went on to argue that this rule,  which was first implemented 6 years  ago\u2014this  is not a new  idea coming  through  this administration;  it has  been here for years\u2014is simple justice.  Why in the world should the people  downwind of a polluting State have  their lifestyle and opportunity to expand businesses affected? Shouldn\u2019t we  have reasonable standards that, if the  air pollution you put in the air is going  to cross over the border\u2014which it naturally will\u2014and affect the air quality  in a neighboring State, you have a responsibility? Well, of course you do.  But, unfortunately, the position Senator  is  taking  is  that  we  shouldn\u2019t  have  any  standards,  we  shouldn\u2019t have any rules.  I would also suggest that there are  utility companies\u2014one that visited my  offices yesterday\u2014that agree with my  position. They want to have a good  rule when it comes to this cross-State  air pollution.  John Rowe is the executive of a company named Exelon. Exelon, Commonwealth Edison, has been around for a  number of years. They have acquired  plants in many different locations. He  was here on the Hill yesterday as a  utility  executive  lobbying  against  RANDPAUL\u2019s resolution of disapproval.  If you believe the earlier statements  made by my colleague and friend Senator BARRASSO, you would assume the  power industry is opposed to the EPA  in this position. Not true. Many forward-looking utility executives have  made decisions to lessen air pollution.  If the Paul resolution is enacted, all of  their  investment will have been  for  nothing other than their own self-satisfaction. They have tried to live up to a  standard  in  the  law which Senator  PAULnow wants to eliminate. That is a  mistake. And it is a mistake because it  rewards bad conduct.  When we come up with new standards  to make America healthier and safer,  it is interesting, the reaction. Some  corporate leaders, when they hear of a  new standard that might make the air  cleaner or water purer, say, That is it,  we have heard from the government,  we have got to go out and hire a lawyer  and a lobbyist to fight it. Others say,  That is it, we believe the standard is  reasonable, we are going to hire the engineers to make it work.  The second approach is one we should  reward. The first approach will be rewarded if Senator PAUL has his way  and eliminates this air pollution standard.  Yesterday, Lisa Jackson, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, came in my office and I  talked to her.

The  Alexander-Pryor  amendment  would limit that dirty air. It would  help our communities. It would make  us healthier. It will create jobs. Let\u2019s  do our job. I ask my colleagues to vote  no on the Paul amendment and become  a  cosponsor of  the Alexander-Pryor  amendment to clean up the air and do  it in a way that helps utilities provide  electricity at the lowest possible cost  to the ratepayer.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask  unanimous  consent  that  Senator  go for 5 minutes and Senator BLUNT for 10 minutes  following  that.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President,  I  rise today to support the cross-State  air pollution rule that protects downwind eastern States such as New Jersey  from upwind power pollution plants\u2019  dirty air, and I rise in defense of the  lives and the breathable air of the people of New Jersey, all 9 million plus.  Last week I asked the Governor of  my State to join this fight. After all,  this rule is supported by the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce and our  largest utility, because it is good for  business. They know it is only fair to  level the playing field for New Jersey  businesses, since we have already substantially cleaned up our electric generation facilities. We are meeting our  obligations.  The rule is supported by just about  everyone in the public health community because it will save an estimated  1,200 lives per year in New Jersey beginning in 2014. Nationally, it will save  up to 34,000 lives, prevent 400,000 asthma attacks, and avoid 1.8 million lost  sick days per year starting in 2014.  The economic benefits of this rule  are estimated to reach anywhere from  $120 billion to $280 billion each year.  We are all focused like a laser beam on  the economy, as we should be, on jobs  and their creation, as we should be, on  reducing deficits and  looking at the  bottom line. But this rule does not create or force a choice between trying to  grow this economy, creating jobs, and  reducing deficits. It is a good rule for  the economy. It is a good rule for the  health and well-being of Americans,  particularly those downwind from the  toxic emissions of powerplants.  Let\u2019s be clear. Corporate coal powerplants enjoy an enormous subsidy that  we are trying to repeal with this rule.  Those polluters can prematurely end  34,000 lives per year and not have to  pay anything for that loss, not have to  pay anything for the health care costs  of all of those who are afflicted at the  end of the day by this dirty air. But yet  that cost is borne by all of us at the  end of the day. To put 34,000 lives in  perspective, that  is almost as many  American  lives  as  are  claimed  by  breast cancer every year. So I ask my  colleagues to join with me and others  in voting against the Paul resolution.  It is a vote for saving 34,000 lives per  year. There are  few  times  in  this  Chamber where you can actually cast a  vote that will save a life. This is one of  those moments.  Vote for over $120 billion in economic  benefits. Vote for cleaner air. Let us  bequeath  to  future  generations  of  Americans not air in our Nation that is  dirty but air that is cleaner. Vote for  keeping  our  children  healthy. You  know, the number of asthma attacks  growing in this country is enormous.  Certainly  in my  home State,  respiratory ailments are on the rise. The  last thing we need to do is to nullify  the ability to create cleaner air at the  end of the day. It is time for us to all  see  this as an opportunity  to ultimately make a difference. It is a time  for us all to see this disapproval resolution for what it is, a path for polluting  industries that make us sick without  paying for the cost it creates. To me,  that is the ultimate corporate welfare.  Let us join together in defeating this  short-sighted resolution.  With that, I yield back the remainder  of my time to the Senator from California, and I yield the floor.  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there was  a time when strong bipartisan majorities in Congress sided with the interests and views of the American people  about curbing pollution to safeguard  the  public\u2019s  right  to  a  clean  and  healthy environment. Citizens placed  their trust in the government to act on  their  behalf,  to  set  science-based  health standards to protect the air we  breathe. On both sides of the aisle,  there was an understanding  that a  healthy environment was critical to  our families, our livelihoods, our economy, and our Nation. To improve the  Nation\u2019s air quality, Congress almost  unanimously passed the Clean Air Act  in 1970, under President Richard Nixon.  Congress then passed the 1990 Clean Air  Act Amendments,  again with  overwhelming majorities in both Chambers,  under President George H.W. Bush.  As part of the 1990 Amendments, Congress specifically required the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to address emissions that interfere with another State\u2019s ability to protect public  health  through  air  quality  requirements. Yet today we still lack the appropriate pollution limits necessary to  protect each and every American from  drifting smog and soot pollutants, and  to protect States  from bearing  the  health and economic costs of distant  polluters who are far beyond their purview. With the cross-State air pollution rule, the EPA  is doing exactly  what we in Congress asked them to do.  This is also exactly what the courts  told them to do, and exactly what they  should do to protect the American public from the hundreds of thousands of  tons of pollutants emitted each year  from coal-fired powerplants.  These pollutants all too often reach  unsafe levels, resulting in air quality  alerts  and  dangerous  health  consequences\u2014all the more so for young  children, the elderly, and those who already have respiratory problems. My  own wife Marcelle is a nurse, and she  knows from experience how harmful air  pollution can be  in contributing  to  asthma, bronchitis, heart attacks, and  even death.  This cross-State rule will protect the  American people  from dangerous air  pollution pumped into our air by the  largest polluters. These are sensible,  workable  limits that would tangibly  improve Americans\u2019  lives. These are  improvements that would foster a better economy by annually preventing up  to 34,000 premature deaths, 15,000 heart  attacks, 19,000 emergency room visits,  400,000 aggravated asthma cases and 1.8  million sick days.  By 2014, in Vermont alone, the health  benefits will add up to $360 million  each year  from these  improvements.  These changes are literally a matter of  life and death for many Americans. For  example,  studies  show  that  in  our  state, curbing smog and soot pollution  will allow 44 Vermonters to celebrate  another birthday and live to see the  next generation of children and grandchildren thrive.  In States  like Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Ohio, and  Pennsylvania, the cross-State rule will  save as many as 1,400 to 3,200 lives each  year. That is a lot of parents, children,  grandparents, aunts, and uncles.  However, S.J. Res. 27 would void the  life-saving,  health-promoting  cross-  State air pollution rule and prohibit  any  future attempt by the EPA to  limit unsafe  levels of air pollutants  that drift across  state boundaries\u2014  making  it one of the all-time most  harmful and egregious attacks on the  Clean Air Act and on the health of the  people we represent. If passed, this resolution would force the EPA to ignore  dangerous, drifting emissions forever,  compelling Americans to accept shorter lives, to accept the risk of heart attacks and strokes, to suffer with asthma and other serious illnesses, and to  accept the degraded quality of the Nation\u2019s parks, waterways, and  forests.  Those are not things that I am willing  to accept and no Member of the Senate  should support.  Powerful special interests and their  allies who want to overturn the cross-  State rule are asking Americans to suffer to save the economy, but their economic arguments fall flat in the face of  the evidence. The truth is, nothing will  sink the economy more than degrading  our  environment and poisoning our  workforce. Pollution regulations help  to lower health care costs, maintain  worker productivity, and support local  economies through recreational industries. The cross-State rule will have  national benefits of up to $280 billion  annually. This dwarfs the annual compliance costs of about $800 million in  2014, which helps explain why most  Americans believe  that health-based  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:25 Jul 20, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\S10NO1.REC S10NO1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",
            "23": "November 10, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S7325  that results in job creation and allows  our companies\u2014big, small and everything in between\u2014to do what they do  best:  innovate,  invest  in the  future,  and create jobs.  We need to support policies that encourage  investment  in  tomorrow\u2019s  technologies, not hamper innovation.  According to the FCC\u2019s own National  Broadband Plan, in 2003 only 15 percent  of Americans had access to broadband.  Today that number is 96 percent, and  we cannot stop until we have 100 percent  market-saturation.  Parts  of  northern New Hampshire are included  in this remaining 4 percent, so to get  the rest of my state, and our great  country, access to broadband, we must  have policies that encourage private-  sector investment and growth.  We have heard it said many times,  but  it  is worth repeating: net neutrality is a solution in search of a problem that does not exist. There is no  market failure and no justifiable reason to  impose such onerous regulations. Quite the contrary\u2014competition  is at an all-time high  in  the  telecommunications and broadband industry. Since the Internet was privatized  in 1994, there has been a steady movement away from government control  and roadblocks.  As  FCC  Commissioner  Robert  McDowell pointed out in his December  2010 dissent to the FCC\u2019s rulemaking  on net neutrality, there are fewer than  a handful of  cases of alleged misconduct by an  Internet service provider, and each of those cases was resolved by the courts in favor of the  consumer. So as you can see, the consumer is well-protected by the existing  system and does not need the heavy-  hand of the government inserting itself  with more regulations.  The White House this week issued a  veto threat for this resolution. However, in doing so it made our point for  us. The White House says it would be  \u2018\u2018ill-advised to threaten the very foundation of innovation in the Internet  economy\u2019\u2019 but then says we need to  keep the Internet \u2018\u2018free and open.\u2019\u2019 Well  I have news for the White House\u2014the  Internet is free and open. I sent a letter, along with 10 of my Senate Commerce Committee Republicans to FCC  Chairman Julius Genachowki a couple  of months ago asking him to provide a  market  justification and cost/benefit  analysis  for  imposing net neutrality  regulations. In his response, he could  not cite any examples of market failure to justify such a rash rulemaking.  Why? Because  no  rationale  exists.  There is no market failure.  I fear that if net neutrality were to  become law, we would be taking an irreversible step backwards at a time  when our economy needs it least.  I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution and say no to government  attempting to take over the Internet.  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will  oppose the motion to proceed to S.J.  Res. 6 a joint resolution of disapproval  of the FCC rule regarding net neutrality.  This resolution of disapproval would  overturn the FCC\u2019s rule that would  codify and supplement existing Internet openness principles while maintaining the ability of Internet service  providers to engage in reasonable network management. The  rules would  prohibit Internet access providers from  preventing its users from sending or receiving lawful content over the Internet; prohibit Internet access providers  from preventing users from connecting  lawful devices  to  the network; and  would require Internet access providers  to treat lawful content, applications,  and  services  in a nondiscriminatory  manner.  It also  included additional  provisions that will create an Open  Internet Advisory Committee to assess  and report to the FCC on developments  in mobile broadband.  The Internet has become an indispensable tool that has spurred innovation,  provided virtually unlimited access to  information and  commerce, and  increased communication through Web  sites, e-mail, and blogs. It has become  difficult to imagine life without the  Internet, a system both open and unrestricted.  The Internet plays a critical role in  our  society  because  it provides  an  equal platform for all users, allowing  for the free exchange of ideas and information. It is important that the Internet remain free and open and not risk  becoming a system with limited access  for some of the smaller Web sites and  their users.  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President,  over the past 20 years, the Internet has  grown and flourished without burdensome  regulations  from Washington.  With the strength of free market forces  behind  it, the Internet has been an  open platform for innovation. It has  spurred business development, much  needed job creation, millions of jobs in  fact. If we are going to keep an open  and free Internet and keep the jobs it  spawns, we should reject the FCC regulation on net neutrality.  The  FCC  reversed  its  successful  hands-off approach last December by  passing net neutrality rules where the  FCC  has  essentially  granted  itself  power over all forms of communication, including the Internet. Congress  did not explicitly delegate this authority to the FCC, and it is our responsibility to hold on to the power that only  we authorize regulations where they  are needed. Unelected agencies do not  get to decide on their own that something needs to be done that Congress  has not, in its congressional and constitutional  responsibility, decided  is  necessary.  These regulations on broadband providers establish the FCC as the Internet\u2019s gatekeeper\u2014a role for which government is not really suited when innovation  could  be  stifled.  Instead  of  spending their resources on new job-  creating investments, on new products,  on new services, Internet providers are  going to have to spend money on lawyers and lobbyists to comply with and  go through the processes the FCC will  require. Congress has never given the  FCC this authority.  Regulators  and  bureaucrats  all  across the government are overstepping their bounds in many areas\u2014the  NMB, the NLRB, the EPA\u2014and it is  time for Congress to push back, and we  can do it today. Regulators should not  regulate without the explicit authority  of Congress. The court said so in the  Comcast case.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time  of the Senator has expired.  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President,  the success of the Internet should not  be tampered with. We need to pass S.J.  Res. 6 that is before us today.  Madam President, have the yeas and  nays been called for?

Let me finish up, since we don\u2019t want  to go over our time. The other thing I  want to talk about for a minute is this  innovation center. In the health care  law, we set aside a $10 billion slush  fund  for  innovation  in payment and  procedures for Medicare patients. We  are going to be spending $10 billion to  figure out how  to pay  for  it more  cheaply and limit the combinations, or  increase  the  combinations  of  combining these things so that the reimbursements are less.  First of all, I don\u2019t understand why it  is going to take $10 billion, but it is a  slush fund. No. 2 is that if you don\u2019t  like the results of that, there is nothing we can do about it except reverse  the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.  No. 2, you can\u2019t sue. You have no injunctive  relief. You have no opportunity to express your desire in a court  of law or through an administrative  procedure  to  challenge  their  elimination of paying for certain procedures  that may  in  fact  save  the country  money but may in fact also hurt the  very patients who are on Medicare.  We have this fund that we cannot  find out anything about; no rules have  been put out on it, and we cannot find  the details of it. Yet, we know what  the purpose of the fund is. It is like the  IPAB fund. It is designed to ration the  care that seniors need to control the  cost of Medicare.  What do we know about Medicare?  One dollar of every three dollars spent  on Medicare doesn\u2019t help anybody get  well and doesn\u2019t keep anybody  from  getting  sick. The  reason  it doesn\u2019t  work is because of the government\u2019s  mandate\u2014we have  all  these  stories  about shortages of drugs. The reason  there are shortages of drugs  in our  country is because Medicare has mandated prices 90 percent of the time so  low that we only have one supplier.  Some of them either have a technical  problem or have decided to stop making a drug that is critical to our seniors because we have a price control  bureaucracy.  There are large problems with the  Medicare law. They need to be recognized and addressed. They need to be  fixed, and the last thing we ought to do  is spend $10 billion figuring out how  not to get somebody treatment, or lessen  the  availability  of  treatment  through the innovation council.  I yield the rest of my time to the  Senator from Wyoming.  Mr. BARRASSO. We  have  talked  about this. There is a program that his  patients and mine have enjoyed, called  Medicare Advantage, and there is an  advantage for patients signing up for  that program. About one in four Americans on Medicare signs up for Medicare Advantage. The advantages of this  program are that it coordinates care,  works with preventive care. Yet, the  President has targeted that for elimination. By 2017, half of the people on  this program, who say they like and  have it, will no longer be eligible to  participate in it because of this health  care law. We explain that to the American people in our second opinion on  \u2018\u2018Medicare and You.\u2019\u2019  Finally, Dr. COBURNtalked about the  IPAB, the Independent Payment Board.  It is a rationing board to me, a board  designed to deny and refuse care. These  are unelected bureaucrats. They don\u2019t  need to have a medical background or  don\u2019t necessarily need to see patients.  It is specifically related to cutting the  amount of money that is paid for patients to have procedures, to see physicians, and to get the care they need,  which is why there is great concern  throughout this country and why the  President\u2019s health care  law becomes  more unpopular every day.  Mr. COBURN.  If  the Senator will  yield for a moment, one of the reasons  our cancer cure rates are a third better  than England is because we don\u2019t have  an IPAB and they do. The No. 1 reason  survival rates from cancer in England  are lower is because treatments are denied by their IPAB for the best treatments, which will save more people\u2019s  lives at the best price. That is something that should not be discounted.  I yield the floor.  Mr. BARRASSO. This health care  law continues to be bad for patients,  for providers, for the doctors who take  care of them, and it is bad for the taxpayers.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.  EDUCATION  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President,  I  would like to take this opportunity to  talk about a bipartisan bill that was  recently passed out of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee,  the HELP Committee, which I chair  and of which Senator MIKEENZIof Wyoming is the ranking member. This bipartisan bill reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of  1965  and would  replace  its  current  iteration, which everyone knows by the  title of \u2018\u2018No Child Left Behind.\u2019\u2019 I want  to start with a few words about the  Federal role in education in this country since ESEA is a key part of that  role.  While it is certainly true education is  primarily a State and local function,  the Federal Government does play an  important  role, and a well-educated  citizenry is clearly in the national interest. A central Federal role is to ensure all Americans, regardless of race,  gender, national origin, religion, or disability, have the same equal opportunity  to a good education as any  other American citizen.  Likewise, the Constitution expressly  states that our National Government  was  formed specifically to  \u2018\u2018promote  the general welfare, and  secure  the  blessings of liberty.\u2019\u2019 The general welfare,  I submit,  is greatly  in danger  when the populace is not adequately  educated, and education is critical to  liberty. As Frederick Douglass so eloquently  noted,  education  \u2018\u2018means  emancipation. It means light and liberty.\u2019\u2019  It is no surprise that the Northwest  Ordinance of 1787 expressly stated that  \u2018\u2018schools and the means of education  shall be forever encouraged.\u2019\u2019 That law  encouraged new territories to establish  schools.  The Federal Government also encouraged States to establish public colleges  and universities through the Morrill  Act of 1862, which started the whole  land grant college movement.  Moving  into the 20th century, the  Servicemen\u2019s  Readjustment  Act,  known as the GI bill, provided grants  to World War II veterans to pursue a  college education.  In 1954, the Supreme Court struck  down laws endorsing racial segregation  in public schools.  In 1958, Congress authorized the National Defense Education Act, the first  Federal loan program to students for  higher education. That was one I borrowed money from when I went to Iowa  State University.  That was followed by the Higher Education Act of 1965 and the Federal Pell  grants enacted in 1972.  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act was passed in 1965 and provided aid to States and school districts  to improve education for children from  low-income families.  In  1975, Congress passed  the Education  for All Handicapped Children  Act, which later became the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,  which was to assist States and districts  in educating children with disabilities.  In 1994, Congress passed the Goals  2000: Educate America Act and the Improving America\u2019s Schools Act.  In 2001, Congress passed the No Child  Left Behind Act, which went even further in terms of what was required of  schools to receive Federal funds.  I go through all this so you can see  that  the Federal  role  in  education  spans over 200 years, and its primary  objective has always been to increase  educational  opportunity  and  to  enhance  educational  attainment. This  context is important to any discussion  about the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  The original goal of ESEA was to  provide resources to the schools with  the most disadvantaged students. This  funding was  needed  because many  States  and  districts  use  education  funding formulas that provide fewer resources to high-poverty schools. Again,  when anyone wants to talk about this,  I  say  go  back  and  read Jonathan  Kozol\u2019s book entitled \u2018\u2018Savage Inequalities,\u2019\u2019 written  in  the mid-1980s,  in  which he pointed out the gross inequality in our schools in America depending upon your ZIP Code\u2014depending  upon where you lived. We knew from  that time that educating poor students  actually requires more resources, not  fewer, and title I was our attempt to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:25 Jul 20, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\S10NO1.REC S10NO1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",

Because  if we are talking  about going with the true market basket, what you should do is actually  have  this  increase.  I will  not  go  through all of the numbers, but they  are significant and they are severe.  There is another thing going around  here on the floor: Oh, Senator MIKULSKI, why are you so upset? It will hurt  future beneficiaries. Well, I am upset  because no matter what time it affects  a beneficiary, it affects a beneficiary.  But what everyone fails to grasp is this  will be an  immediate\u2014underline the  word immediate\u2014cut, according to the  Social Security\u2019s Chief Actuary. If we  pass this this year, this chained CPI  begins December of 2012. So 1 year from  this December, it would go into effect.  That means if you are 65 years old,  your benefit will be reduced that year.  By the time 10 years later, your benefit  will have been reduced five times as  much. And if you make it to 85, your  benefit will actually be reduced by 10  times as much.  This is, to me, a horrific idea. The  current CPI-W, which is what we call  the cost of living, was used in 1972. It  was the only measure we had at the  time. It was viewed as an advanced  thing  for an  inflation-proof benefit.  Now when we look at it, what we know  is  that  we  know  the  purchasing  power\u2014not the purchasing power, what  is the market basket that seniors use.  Chained CPI might be  fine  in other  areas or other categories. I am not  going to debate this here today.  But what I do want to do this time,  this place, I want to sound the alert. I  am going to ring the bell. I am going to  be at my battle station saying to every  member of our caucus, and every member of the people on the other side of  the aisle, please, read up on this. Know  what we are doing. If you are going to  vote, I do not want to hear buyer\u2019s remorse a year from now. I do not want  to hear buyer\u2019s remorse 2 years from  now. I do not want to hear from the  seniors in my home State of Maryland  say: Where were you, BARBARA? Did  you say anything? Did you do anything? So I am saying here today, get  out our policy books and for God\u2019s sake  read them. Read them. And do not read  what this think tank or that editorial  board says, read the Social Security  Actuary. Because I am telling you, we  are about to do something that is irrevocable.  I believe in old-fashioned values, and  one of the great ones is honor thy father and thy mother. It is not just a  great commandment to live by, it is  sure a great public policy to govern by.  The American people every day particularly who work hard now and live  by the rules, go by the rules, pay into  Social Security over a lifetime, we said  to them: If you do that, your Social Security will be a guaranteed benefit. It  will be a lifetime benefit. It will be reliable and undeniable. And it will be inflation proof.  FDR signed the bill that created that  contract. Every President regardless of  the party has kept that promise. And it  is up to this Congress not to shred the  social contract with the seniors of the  United States of America.  I want to yield the floor to someone  from the Finance Committee who has  done so much work on this, such great  work, such due diligence, and has a  grasp of both the policy and the impact  that it has on people.  I yield the floor.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  FRANKEN.) The Senator  from Washington.  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President,  I  thank my colleague, the senior Senator  from Maryland, for her leadership on  this issue for protecting seniors and  protecting women.  It  seems  to me  every time we have a battle that is  about  undercutting  the  benefits  to  women in America, BARBARAMIKULSKI  is on the Senate floor or in the halls  and in various meeting rooms making  sure that America knows what these  proposals are.  I could not have been more proud of  her when she led all the women Senators on the Democratic side of the  aisle to push back on the Bush Administration\u2019s proposal to privatize Social  Security. At that point in time, she  most succinctly told Americans that  women, more than any other in that  age group, would suffer because they  live longer, they depend on Social Security,  and  if Social Security was  privatized, women would feel the brunt  of it.  So I am proud to be out here this  afternoon with her to talk about this  proposal that has been\u2014we cannot tell,  because we do not know. We are not on  the supercommittee. But it seems to be  floating around in various forms, various  organizations may  be  talking  about  it, the notion that we would  change Social Security.  I know at home in my State of Washington, people  seem  to be confused  when we are talking about our budgets.  And we are obviously having to make  tough budget decisions, as are people  around dining room tables, around city  halls, around our State capitols and  here in Congress are having discussions  about how to have a budget to live  within our means.  But when you talk to them about the  primary way\u2014and one proposal that  surfaced  in the  last budget negotiations  in July was  to automatically  take $300 billion of cuts right off the  top as the major proposal out of a concept called chained CPI. When you  think about  that,  the  first  shot of  budget cuts would be on the backs of  seniors,  it  is almost as  if  someone  thought seniors cooked up exotic financial instruments and foisted them on  the U.S. economy and somehow they  should pay the price. We know that is  not the case.  So why are people targeting these  seniors now? And we are not sure if  they are. We have just heard various  rumors  that perhaps  this notion of  chained CPI, a change in Social Security benefits as my colleague just outlined, would be a proposal.  I am here to say, I am not for having  the seniors in America share the brunt  of sacrifice with a proposal such as this  that would clearly be on the backs of  seniors. It is not something they can  afford. I know some of my colleagues  may have endorsed a chained CPI, a  change in the consumer price index to  calculate inflation. But that is a cut  that would increase over time. And literally, the longer you live, the more  you are penalized. It  is such a disproportionate impact to women who do  live  longer than men and count on  those benefits for their living.  In my State, changes to the cost-of-  living adjustment would hurt more  than 1 million Washingtonians. Social  Security has kept about 30 percent of  Washington residents who are 65 and  older out of poverty. That is what it  has done for them. And what is more,  25 percent of seniors in my State live  on Social Security alone. So there is a  population that is depending on Social  Security, and they are  living on  it  alone, or it is making up\u2014another 21  percent of them\u2014it makes up 90 percent of their income.  I think this demonstrates that we  cannot support these kinds of cuts, especially at the magnitude this proposal  is talking about. The Social Security  Office of the Actuary has reported that  chained CPI would reduce the COLA by  about .3 percent a year. So let\u2019s look at  that example. A single woman, 65 years  old in Washington State, would get a  monthly  benefit  of  about  $1,100  a  month or $13,300 annually.  By age 80, if chained CPI would pass,  that would result in a $56 per month or  $672 annual cut in that benefit. So that  is less food, that is less medicine, that  is less vital care for these seniors. If  that  individual actually  lived  to  90  years old, it would be an $87 a month  cut and a $1,044 cut annually. If you  think about the costs these seniors endure\u2014and  I  for  one have  proposed  changing the market basket of goods  that the CPI is based on, because if you  think about it, we have a market basket of goods  for their CPI that are  what the overall economy looks at.  But seniors have a much more expensive market basket of goods. They have  to buy more medicine. They have other  additional out-of-pocket health  care  expenses. And so their costs are going  up at a higher rate. But this proposal,  if you  think about  it,  the average  monthly cost of food for a single elderly individual is about $231 per month.  That is what the average is, about $53  a week. That is based on data from the  Elder  Economic  Security  Standard  Index. So an individual at 80 basically  means they would have 1 week less groceries under chained CPI.  That is what it means. They would  have 1 week  left of groceries every  month.  In my State, when you think about  the average out-of-pocket health care  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:25 Jul 20, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\S10NO1.REC S10NO1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",

He really liked  people, and he took his time to give everyone his full attention. That quality  along with his sincerity contributed to  the vast number of  friends and acquaintances who  respect  and  adore  him.  Pat led a life of service to our State  and Nation. After graduating from the  College of  Idaho and obtaining post  graduate credits from the University of  Idaho and Boise State University, Pat  joined the U.S. Army through which he  served 5 years in Active service and another 5 years in Reserve service. During his military service, Pat was promoted to the rank of captain and qualified for Airborne wings, the Ranger tab  and Special Forces green beret. After  returning to Wilder, he grew a farm of  32 acres into a more than 1,500-acre-  farm and was a partner in Snake River  Produce. He also served for 10 years as  the director of the Idaho State Department of Agriculture before he was  elected in 2008 to represent Idaho\u2019s District 10 in the State legislature.  His list of accomplishments and associations with a number of Idaho and  national organizations,  including his  service as past president of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, is extensive. He  advocated  for good  jobs, a healthy  rural economy, business development,  lower taxes, less regulation, parental  involvement  in education, protection  of private property and water rights  and a  lean and accountable government. His principles  included belief  that  \u2018\u2018promoting strong  families and  renewing an individual sense of responsibility are key to reversing the erosion of our nation\u2019s foundation.\u2019\u2019 He  worked considerately to advance these  and other objectives on behalf of Idahoans.  I extend my condolences and prayers  to Pat\u2019s family, friends and loved ones,  including his wife Suzanne his three  children and his parents Michio and  Ayako. Pat was a great friend to many,  and he was very proud of his family. He  was a talented farmer and public servant. Pat Takasugi\u2019s contribution  to  our State will not be forgotten.\u2211  f  REMEMBERING CORPORAL VOLLIE  PITTS  \u2211Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I wish to  recognize  and  pay  tribute  to CPL  Vollie  Pitts  of  Hutchinson,  KS.  Corpora1 Pitts  proudly  served  our  country in World War I and has been  revered as a hero by his family, friends,  and those who served alongside him.  Today it is my privilege to share the  story of this unsung hero and honor  him for his service and sacrifice on behalf of our country.  Corporal Pitts was born on February  14, 1897, and raised on his family\u2019s farm  in Salina, KS. Like so many Kansans of  his generation, Corporal Pitts put his  country\u2019s needs before his own, leaving  his parents and three siblings behind to  volunteer as a member of the Kansas  National Guard. At the young age of 19,  he was first called into duty when his  regiment was mobilized to the Mexican  border in 1916. Their mission was to  protect Americans from Mexican outlaws who were operating along the U.S.  border. Following the successful completion of their mission, his regiment  joined with another and became the  137th Kansas Infantry Regiment.  Corporal Pitts was again called into  duty  in 1917 to serve his county  in  World War I. In the spring of 1918, Corporal Pitts and his  regiment made  their way to the frontlines for one of  the most  significant battles of  the  First World War\u2014the Battle of the Argonne Forest. It was during this battle  when  Corporal  Pitts  courageously  rushed a German gun emplacement,  single-handedly capturing the gun and  part of its crew. His heroic actions that  day saved countless lives, including the  men of his own unit. Even after he was  wounded and gassed, Corporal Pitts  continued to fight until he was forced  to seek help at a field hospital, where  doctors determined his fighting days  had come to an end.  Upon his arrival back in the United  States, Corporal Pitts received an honorable discharge from the service and  returned home  to Kansas. On September 2, 1920, he began a new chapter  in  his  life  and  married  Gladys  Reichardt. The young  couple made  their home in Hutchinson, Kansas and  raised two daughters, Koloma and Patricia. Several decades  later  in 1954,  Corporal Pitts passed away in Denver,  CO, surrounded by his family.  Corporal  Pitts  exemplified many  traits we can all admire: courage, dedication, and selflessness. His heroic actions during World War I will forever  remain a testimony to his love for this  country  and  his  fellow Americans.  America is proud and honored to call  Corporal Pitts one of our own, and we  shall never forget his courage and sacrifice, which made America a stronger  and freer nation.\u2211  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  and a withdrawal which were referred  to the appropriate committees.

            "71": "November 10, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE S7373  By Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr.  INHOFE, and Mr. CRAPO):  S.  1848. A bill  to promote  transparency,  accountability,  and  reform  within the United Nations system, and  for other purposes; to the Committee  on Foreign Relations.  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I rise to  speak about  legislation  I  introduced  today to encourage comprehensive and  long-lasting reforms at the United Nations. I want to thank my colleague  Senator JAMES INHOFE from Oklahoma  for joining me on this effort. I also  commend the Chair of the House Foreign Affairs\u2019 Committee\u2014and  fellow  Floridian Congresswoman ILEANAROS-  LEHTINEN for leading on this effort in  the House of Representatives.  The United Nations was created in  1945 with the specific mandate of maintaining the hard-fought peace that followed the end of World War II. Just as  it was then, today our nation\u2019s security  and prosperity  is  influenced by conflicts and events taking place in various near and  far-flung places. The  United States cannot and should not  attempt to address these conflicts on  its own. More than six decades later,  we still need a U.N. with resolve, a U.N.  that acts with effectiveness and purpose. Sadly, the U.N.\u2019s persistent ethics and accountability problems are  limiting its role. Until the organization addresses these important issues,  the stature of the organization will  continue to suffer in the eyes of the  world.  Examples of this troubling situation  abound, from the ongoing efforts to circumvent direct negotiations to end the  Israeli-Arab conflict, to the discredited  Human Rights Council  led  by  the  world\u2019s most notorious  tyrants and  human rights violators, to the proliferation  of mandates  that  have  clouded the organization\u2019s mission and  effectiveness.  My hope with this legislation is to  provide an incentive for the United Nations and the President, to modernize  that international body along a spirit  of  transparency,  respect  for  basic  human  freedoms, and effective nonproliferation. This  legislation would  also attempt to address the anti-Semitic attitudes that have become so  prevalent in certain corners of the U.N.  and seriously diminish the credibility  of the entire U.N. system.  At the core of these reforms is an effort to instill a sense of transparency  and competition at the U.N. by  its  adoption of a budgetary model that relies mostly on voluntary contributions.  This legislation would also strengthen  the  international standing of human  rights by reforming the U.N. Human  Rights Council in a way that it would  deny membership  to nations under  U.N. sanctions, designated by our Department of State as States Sponsors  of Terrorism, or failing to take measures to combat and end the despicable  practice of human trafficking. Other  provisions seek meaningful reforms at  the U.N. Relief and Work Agency that  provides assistance to Palestinian refugees of the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict.  This legislation is needed because the  structure and bureaucratic culture of  the organization often makes it impossible or, at best, downright difficult to  achieve meaningful reforms. It follows  on the steps of previously successful  Congressional initiatives on this matter. Every previously successful American effort for reform at the U.N. has  been accompanied with the threat of  withholding  our  valuable  contributions. I wish this wasn\u2019t the case, but  this is the record, so it is part of our  legislation.  In closing, the United Nations has  served  as  the  primary multilateral  forum to address peace and security  issues throughout the world, and I look  forward to working with my Senate  colleagues  in  achieving meaningful  transparency  and  accountability  reforms at that international body.  By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr.  CASEY, Mr. TESTER, Mr. BROWN  of  Ohio,  Mr.  Mr.  FRANKEN, Mr. BINGAMAN, Ms.  of  Mrs.  KLOBUCHAR, Mr.  JOHNSON LEAHY,  and  Dakota,  South  BOXER):  S. 1850. A bill to expand and improve  opportunities  for  beginning  farmers  and ranchers, and for other purposes;  to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, among  the most hopeful occurrences in rural  America is when someone is able to get  started in farming or ranching and go  on  to build a  successful operation.  Typically,  the  beginning  farmer  or  rancher  is continuing an established  family  farm or  ranch, although  increasingly he or she is taking on the  challenge of starting and growing an  entirely new operation.  Because farming and ranching families are so vital to rural communities  and our Nation as a whole, there has  been a great deal of concern for decades as America\u2019s agricultural producers have grown older and retired, as  farm numbers  fell, and as men and  women who had a great desire to become the next generation of farmers  and ranchers were unable to find the  opportunities and resources to do so.  Across America, we are fortunate to  have many  families and  individuals  who possess the ability, motivation,  and dedication to start or continue a  farm or ranch and build a rewarding  life in agriculture. Our Nation needs  more beginning farmers and ranchers  across all types of operations\u2014including commercial-scale crop and animal  agriculture  systems,  organic  agriculture, growing for local food systems  and farmers markets, and even farming  in urban and suburban areas. We need  more beginning farmers and ranchers  to secure critical supplies of food, fuel,  and fiber for the future. We need them  as stewards to care for and conserve  our soil, water, and other natural resources. We need more new  farming  and ranching families as contributing  members of healthy and vibrant local  communities.  Aspiring and beginning farmers and  ranchers  confront  tremendous  challenges, yet  there are  some hopeful  signs. According to the Census of Agriculture, the number of farms in the  United States increased four percent  between 2002 and 2007. The new farms  tended to be smaller, have lower sales,  and  rely more  on  off-farm  income  sources. New farmers are also more diverse, with  significant  increases between 2002 and 2007 in the number of  farm operators who are women, Hispanic, American Indian, African-American, and Asian-American.  We know from experience that carefully designed programs can very effectively  help  beginning  farmers  and  ranchers apply their talents and efforts,  assemble  the  necessary  resources, capitalize upon opportunities,  and succeed. I am proud that in the  two farm bills, in 2002 and 2008, that we  enacted while I was chairman of the  Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry  Committee, we adopted a number of  initiatives to strengthen and improve  programs at the Department of Agriculture that assist beginning farmers  and ranchers.  The  legislation  I  am  introducing  today, joined by a number of my colleagues, is crafted to extend, improve,  and strengthen beginning farmer and  rancher programs and initiatives that  we adopted  in the most recent two  farm bills and in earlier farm bills and  other legislation. The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Opportunity Act of 2011  will build upon the successful record of  the earlier legislation and its implementation by the U.S. Department of  Agriculture in cooperation with a variety of public and private institutions  and organizations.  Let me emphasize that the beginning  farmer and rancher initiatives in the  legislation we are introducing today,  and the programs now being carried  out by USDA, are not designed or intended to guarantee the success of any  beginning farmer or rancher or to give  anyone something for nothing. All they  do is to offer a helping hand, a better  opportunity, to women and men who  make the effort and apply themselves,  who are willing to learn and to do the  necessary work to achieve their goals  and succeed in farming and ranching.  A key feature of the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Opportunity Act of 2011  is to extend and strengthen the beginning farmer and rancher development  program, which we enacted in 2008. In  this program, USDA provides competitively-awarded grants to qualified organizations that deliver training and  education  for beginning  farmers and  ranchers. This new legislation makes it  a new priority  for USDA  to  issue  grants to support agricultural rehabilitation and vocational training for military veterans and to deliver training  and education to help veterans who are  beginning farmers and ranchers.

            "95": "E2030  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014Extensions of Remarks November 10, 2011  In the early days, his work mainly consisted  of simple plumbing with water storage tanks  and wind driven pumps. Between 1918\u20131927,  business continued to grow as the demand for  modern  indoor plumbing  increased.  In 1933,  Andy Thorsen  the Plumber moved  to 134  Lander Avenue to a larger facility.  As post war construction boomed across the  nation, Thorsen\u2019s grew with the continued increase in new homes and business construction. Eventually, Andy expanded his business  to  include plumbing, heating,  sheet metal,  storage tanks, pumps, motors, windmills, hardware and paint.  During the 1950\u2019s, air conditioning became  popular in the central valley providing comfort  and quality to homes. Thorsen\u2019s responded by  expanding their services to include central air  conditioning and heating.  Thorsen\u2019s saw its greatest expansion during  the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s. Andy Thorsen\u2019s  two  sons, Rodney and Andy Jr., were both  involved as partners in the business until 1965  when Rodney took over as president became  sole owner of \u2018\u2018Thorsen\u2019s Plumbing & Air Conditioning Inc.\u2019\u2019 The name change reflected the  growing importance of air conditioning.  In 1977, Rodney Thorsen completed  the  purchase of 20 acres of  land and built a  19,500 sq. ft. building on North Walnut, employing 80\u2013100 people and expanded  to  include commercial, residential and service for  plumbing and HVAC  throughout  the Merced  and Stanislaus counties. Rodney managed the  company for the next 20 years and in 1984,  his youngest son Norman graduated from college and returned to Turlock to take over the  reins of the company. In 1988, Norman was  involved  in a  serious automobile accident  which forced Rodney to take over managing  the company again.  Over the next 14 years, Norman was able to  help Rodney manage the company on a limited basis. Through the skill and devotion of  key long-term employees in the office and the  field, Thorsen\u2019s Inc. was able to remain competitive.  In 2002, Craig Pitau was asked  to  join  Thorsen\u2019s as the General Manager and was  given the opportunity to purchase ownership in  the company. Craig worked with Norman managing Thorsen\u2019s until Norman\u2019s untimely passing  in 2004.  In 2005, Rodney also passed  away. Today, the company is owned by Carl  Thorsen,  Don  Thorsen,  Judy  Thorsen  Enchelmayer and Craig Pitau.  Mr. Speaker, please  join me  in praising  Thorsen\u2019s Plumbing & Air Conditioning Inc. for  their 100 years of operation.  COMMEMORATING NATIONAL  FAMILY CAREGIVERS MONTH  HON. LAURA RICHARDSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 10, 2011  Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor the 65 million Americans who  spend on average 20 hours per week selflessly caring  for  family members or  friends  who, through age, disability, or illness, have  lost the ability to care for themselves.  For most of us, the act of caring for those  in need is a basic aspect of what it means to  be human. Compassion, either through charitable giving or community service, is inseparable from American ideals of human rights for  every member of our society. Whenever we  treat those around us as we want to be treated, we contribute to a culture of responsibility  and respect for life that leads us to do great  things in the name of humanity.  Last week, President Barack Obama proclaimed November 2011 as National Family  Caregivers Month. Anyone who spends time  caring for a loved one in need is considered  a family caregiver. Let us use this occasion to  honor these everyday heroes and raise awareness of the profound contributions they make  to society.  Family caregivers save taxpayers hundreds  of billions of dollars each year through their efforts.  According  to studies compiled by  the National Family Caregivers Association, the value  of the unpaid services provided each year is  estimated to be $375 billion, which is almost  twice as much as  the $158 billion spent  in  2009 on homecare and nursing home services  combined.  In my home state of California alone there  were 3,419,481 family caregivers in 2004 providing over $36 billion worth of care. Though  they are mostly untrained,  family caregivers  now provide about 80% of all long-term care  in the United States.  Imagine if taxpayers had to foot the full bill.  Now, more  than ever,  family caregivers are  essential  to providing  the best services and  deserve  the support of government and  the  medical community.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, the US Census  projects a massive growth in the number of  Americans 65 and older as the baby-boomer  generation  ages. Populations  in  this  age  bracket will double in 23 states by 2030.  As medical progress means  longer  lives,  families struggle  to provide  long-term  family  care than they did in past decades. Families  are smaller and more spread out, and many  family caregivers must juggle work and raising  children in addition to their caregiving responsibilities. Family caregivers may need to operate complex medical equipment or practice  delicate procedures without any formal training.  The  \u2018\u2018graying of America\u2019\u2019 will have a  tremendous impact on families providing care for  their older members.  Many public health officials are concerned  that we may not be ready to assume the roles  of  family  caregivers. Studies  suggest  that  many Americans have not spent much  time  thinking about or preparing for long-term care.  People who have no experience as a family  caregiver may have extreme difficulty  in approaching such a responsibility.  Mr. Speaker, the fact is that most of us will  find ourselves in a similar situation, either giving or  requiring  long  term care at various  points in our lives.  Family caregivers often put themselves second as they balance competing commitments  to their jobs, families, and communities. Tragically, more than 1 in 10 family caregivers report that their physical health has deteriorated  as a result of extreme stress.  Family  caregivers  experiencing  extreme  stress have been shown to age prematurely.  This level of stress can take as much as 10  years off a family caregiver\u2019s life.  Mr. Speaker, 40  to 70 percent of  family  caregivers have clinically significant symptoms  of depression with approximately a quarter to  half of  these caregivers meet  the diagnostic  criteria for major depression.  We must also remember that many disabled  veterans are supported by family caregivers.  Having given so much for their country, I believe  that  they and  their  family members  should not have to struggle to live out a full,  dignified life.  Therefore, we should do everything possible  to support family caregivers and lighten their  burdens.  It begins with encouraging people  to  take  adequate steps  to prepare  for  their  future  care. This means setting aside funds to cover  unforeseen medical expenses, signing a living  will, and making preparations with family and  friends. Health professionals must be sensitive  to  the needs of  family caregivers and enlist  them in formulating a patient\u2019s long-term care  plan.  We also need to make sure that family caregivers have access  to  information and  resources that can help them meet their responsibilities with minimal strain and unnecessary  cost.  Finally, we must ensure that the concerns of  family caregivers are  reflected  in all major  healthcare legislation.  We are all family caregivers, Mr. Speaker. I  urge my colleagues to work together to support human dignity and the American family.

            "5": "November 18, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE H7837  How do they do that? They do that  by having endless delays. Why are endless delays important to employers? So  that they can hire union-busting law  firms to come in and intimidate and  teach  employers how  to  intimidate  workers because, don\u2019t forget, the employer has the right from the moment  they\u2019re served notice to have captive  meetings in the workplace where they  threaten the workers with the loss of  jobs, where they threaten the workers  with being fired, where they threaten  the workers of sending work to China  or elsewhere, where they threaten the  workers that they won\u2019t get the promotion, where they change the workers\u2019 shift time from maybe day shift to  graveyard shift and keep rotating them  around to show them that they\u2019re in  control and the workers have no rights.  And if you can do it for 7 days, you  have a chance. If you can do it for 10  days, you have a better chance. If you  can do it for as many as 2,000 days that  these law firms have kept the process  open, you can kill  the drive  for a  union. You can intimidate the workers.  How else do they do it? When workers decide among themselves that we  want a unit within this company, within this factory to represent us, this bill  now says that the employer can come  in and rearrange the members of the  unit that would have that election.  They can stuff the ballot box. They can  pick your candidates to stand for election. Doesn\u2019t sound very Democratic to  me. But that\u2019s what they get to do  under this bill that\u2019s proposed.  The workers no longer get to decide,  as the law says they get to decide. The  workers no longer get to decide, as the  Supreme Court says they get to decide.  The employer gets to decide. The arrogance of these people to suggest that  they should pick the  leaders of the  workers, that they should pick the organization of the workers who have a  right to organize.  So they get to delay the elections.  They encourage and provide for and define the right to continue to file frivolous lawsuits so that this process never  ends. You can bankrupt these workers  if they try to run head-on-head with  these big law firms that are specialized  in this, that travel around the country  to take away the rights at work.  What does this mean? This means underpinning the basic organization  in  the American workplace  today  that  speaks on behalf of the middle class.  This  is  from  the organization  that  brought you the great American weekend. This  is  the  organization  that  brought you the 8-hour day. This is the  organization that brought you overtime pay if you work longer than 8  hours. This  is the organization that  brought you sick leave. This is the organization that brought women their  rights at work. This is the organization  that makes safe work places. This is  the organization that provided, for the  first  time, pensions and  retirement  benefits for workers.  Any wonder why these corporations,  why the Chamber of Commerce is so  regular  set against this? Because they don\u2019t  want to do this anymore. They want to  ship the jobs to China. They want no  minimum wage. They want a sub-minimum wage. They want no rights for  workers. How will the American families survive that? They\u2019ve already off-  loaded all of the health care costs they  possibly could.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an  additional 30 seconds.  Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.  They\u2019ve off-loaded all of the pension  costs they possibly could on the backs  of these workers.  We should not allow that to happen,  not in this country, not in this Congress. We should not allow it to happen  to American workers and to their families. We should defeat this very anti-  family piece of legislation.  Ms. FOXX. Mr.  Speaker,  order.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. POLIS. I did yield an additional  30 seconds to the gentleman from California.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has again expired.  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an  additional 30 seconds.  Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.  As for regular order, I would like to remind  the  gentlewoman  from North  Carolina  that when  the vote came,  there wasn\u2019t a single Republican vote  back in the Clinton era. Not a single  Republican  vote.  Once  again,  you  balked when it came time to vote.  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I now would  like to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee, Dr. ROE, a  southern gentleman who understands  the rules.  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Dr. FOXX, I  thank you for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this rule and the underlying  bill. Our country is in the middle of a  jobs crisis, no question. Both sides understand that. The national unemployment rate has hovered around 9 percent  for the longest time in my lifetime,  and in Tennessee it\u2019s even higher, 9.8  percent. Millions of American families  are struggling as we speak.  Amidst all of this uncertainty, the  House, with bipartisan  support, has  passed 22 jobs bills. Right down this  hallway here this week the U.S. Senate  worked so hard they voted two times  on two Federal judges. That\u2019s all the  work that took place with 22, many of  them  bipartisan  bills,  passed, Mr.  Speaker.  I think right now we\u2019ve seen in this  country, to hold up jobs, the delay of  the Keystone pipeline, which would essentially, over  time, provide us as  much oil from Canada as we\u2019re getting  from OPEC right now. 1.3 million barrels a day would essentially relieve us  and help our national security and create thousands of jobs.  So why are we here today? What happens currently?  Mr. Speaker, I grew up in a union  household. My  father was  a union  worker at that time  for the United  Rubber Workers Union. He worked in a  factory and he made shoe heels. And  the union, we have a right in this country, employees have a right to organize  and to vote in a union or not.  So what\u2019s happening right now? Well,  currently in 2010, 92 percent of the initial union elections were held under a  voluntary election agreement of when  they had an election, 92 percent. Only 8  percent went to the NLRB election official, at which time then they had to  sit down  together\u2014that\u2019s what happens\u2014to agree on the rules of the election. And as the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. SCOTT) pointed out, the  NLRB is supposed to be a fair arbiter\u2014  like you\u2019re playing a basketball game  and you go to someone\u2019s home gym;  you expect the referees there to carry  out a fair game for both sides\u2014so that  both sides have a chance to give their  side of the story.  So in June of this year, what\u2019s happened? The NLRB issued a rule that  would say that an employer has 7 days  to find an attorney to present their  side of the case. And remember, in this,  just the description of this, there are  over 400 pages of rules that you have to  go through or  information that the  lawyer has to go through and has 7  days to get that done, and an employee  would have  just  10 days  to decide  whether they want a union or not. And  they have that right.  Today, almost 70 percent of the elections held, the union wins. And what\u2019s  the average time of the election? Thirty-one days. So that means if you want  to vote on the 1st of October of 2011,  the average time, by the end of that  month, 70 percent, almost three out of  four, would be picked, yes, we want a  union.  this, after  b0940  So what happens after  these 10 days?  The  second  thing  that  the union  wants  is the amount of  information  that\u2019s required that an employee give  up. What would that be? Well, that  would be personal information, including your work schedule, your home address, phone numbers, etc. Right now,  what we want and what this bill says is  that the employees get to decide with  regard to just their names and what  other ways they want to get contacted.  I think that\u2019s fair. I think that\u2019s right.  Let the employees decide.  Mr. Speaker, also what my colleague  from California spoke of is the bargaining unit. For over two decades, the  NLRB has used a standard to define  what a \u2018\u2018bargaining unit\u2019\u2019 is. This is a  new definition. We have done this for  almost 30 years in this country, and we  want this to change. As I understand  the law, it\u2019s against the law for an employer right now\u2014and it has been for  over  three  decades\u2014to  threaten  a  worker.

I greatly respect and I hear Mr. CONYERSand my friend, Mr. NADLER. I understand their strong feelings, and I  would concur with many of them.  I\u2019d like to thank the gentleman from  Virginia, my good  friend Mr. GOODLATTE, for his efforts to bring this bipartisan resolution to the floor. I also  want to thank him for resisting the efforts of some in his party to enshrine  the disastrous fiscal policies of the Tea  Party into our Constitution.  My colleagues, our budget is broken.  After years of special interest handouts  on both the revenue and spending ledgers, we now have a system that requires us to borrow over $1 trillion just  to meet our basic obligations.  Why? Why do we borrow? Has anybody in this body ever really asked this  question?  It seems we borrow because there is  not the political will in this body to  make  the difficult decisions  in our  country  that we need  to do. We\u2019re  elected leaders. We\u2019re elected to lead.  But when it comes to the long-term fiscal imbalance our Nation faces, many  in this body seem to be more interested  in securing the next election than securing the safety and soundness of our  fiscal future.  And no one party\u2019s at fault. Both parties are responsible for the financial  mess we\u2019re facing. Our national debt  did not reach its current level overnight, although we seem to have amnesia, what happened in September of \u201908  when Secretary Paulson came to talk  to us about the sky was falling. But the  problem has been decades in the making, with the current economic climate  making the issue that much more visible.  These are serious times, and serious  times call for serious people to make  serious decisions; and we know what  these decisions must be. We cannot cut  our way out of this mess, and we cannot and should not tax our way out of  this mess. We need, quite simply, a balanced approach that gets us to a balanced budget.  If I could tell you a situation in my  home State, when I was appropriations  chair, we were faced with a budget that  was breaking the constitution.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. NADLER. I yield the gentleman  an additional 30 seconds.  Mr. BOSWELL. And so we decided to  take it on. We were breaking our constitution in the State, and we took it  on. And we worked with downtown, we  worked with  everybody  across  the  State, and we came up with a solution  and it\u2019s working. There\u2019s money in the  bank in Iowa. The unemployment rate  is around 6 percent, and that\u2019s something we need to be striving to achieve  here. We can do it.  What we have left out in this that we  need to consider as we go through the  steps is how do we include the revenue  side of it. We had a revenue piece. But  it\u2019s working. And it\u2019ll work here.  We can do this. Let\u2019s work together.  I urge an \u2018\u2018aye\u2019\u2019 vote.  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I  yield  11\u20442minutes  to  the gentleman  from California (Mr. COSTA).  Mr. COSTA. I rise in support of the  bipartisan  balanced  budget  amendment. I want to thank my colleagues,  Congressman GOODLATTE and others,  who have worked on this effort, and  really urge my colleagues that this is  the time that we need to come together  to act on behalf of the better interest  of our Nation.  Clearly, a majority of the citizens I  represent in the San Joaquin Valley  agree that Washington needs to get its  fiscal house in order.  We all want a balanced budget, but  too few are willing to make an agreement that will move us toward that  goal. That\u2019s why the passage of the  constitutional  amendment  requiring  the Federal Government to live within  its means is an important step. But it  is only a step.  To balance our budget, Members of  both parties still have to come together to set priorities and, yes, make  compromises and shared sacrifices to  produce  fair, balanced budgets each  year. And never has the need been ever  so clear.  Our national debt recently surpassed  the GDP for the first time since World  War II. Each American\u2019s share of the  debt is now greater than their average  salary. Congress could have acted sooner, but we haven\u2019t; and we can no  longer afford to wait.  b1040  The bipartisan passage of this balanced budget amendment is an important and necessary step toward a sound  fiscal future, and as a cosponsor, we  should pass this measure. But we also  should reach a larger agreement with  the supercommittee that\u2019s fair and balanced on entitlement reform and revenues. If we do so, we will begin to restore the confidence by the American  public that we can work together to  get our economy back on track and  create  the  jobs  that all Americans  want.  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, it is now  my privilege to yield 4 minutes to a  member of the Ways and Means Committee, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL).  Mr. NEAL. I thank the gentleman for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, earlier this week Bruce  Bartlett, a former Reagan adviser, who  recently testified before the Ways and  Means Committee, commented about  the  Republicans\u2019  balanced  budget  amendment. He stated:  \u2018\u2018The proposal that Republican leaders plan to bring up is, frankly, nuts.  The truth  is that Republicans don\u2019t  care one whit about actually balancing  the budget. They prefer to delude voters with the pie-in-the-sky promises  that amending the Constitution will  painlessly solve our budget problems.\u2019\u2019  Mr. Speaker, the mystical date here  is January 19, 2001. Bill Clinton says  goodbye and leaves a surplus not subject, by the way, to opinion today but  subject to fact of $5.7 trillion. So the  decision is made to cut taxes in 2001 by  a trillion dollars. The decision is made  in 2003 to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion, and  then subsequently to engage in a war  in Iraq based upon the faulty premise  of weapons of mass destruction.  Now, our Republican  friends often  come to the microphone and say things  like, well, we  all  spent  too much  money. No, I didn\u2019t spend too much  money. I voted against the war in Iraq.  I voted against the Bush tax cuts. I  voted against their prescription benefit  proposal.  Our friend from New Jersey a moment ago said the math is clear. But  for Republicans, why is the math only  clear when Bill Clinton  is President  and Barack Obama is President? They  ran these deficits through the roof.  There is no escaping that conclusion.  The budget has been balanced five  times since the end of World War II,  four of those times during the Clinton  Presidency. Twenty-two million  jobs  were created during those years. This  is the equivalent of using a Luger to  clean the wax out of our ears.  This proposal  is beyond  the pale.  They ran across the country for the  last 2 years with the Tea Party-types  saying, Have you read the bill? Yes,  we\u2019ve read the bill, and we\u2019ve come to  the conclusion this is a reckless pursuit of defying our constitutional responsibility when we\u2019ve already demonstrated that we can accomplish these  ends without disturbing the Constitution that they attempted during the  campaign cycle to merit.  Let\u2019s honor the Constitution, the Tea  Party said. And today what do they  propose? Disturbing the Constitution  after their financial malfeasance for 8  years.  This argument  they bring  to  the  floor  today  is a political gimmick.  George Bush, Sr., lobbied me on the  amendment many years ago when it  failed, and respectfully I pointed out to  him that it was nothing more than political theater. When President Bush,  Jr., invited me to the White House to  discuss his tax cut proposal in 2001 a  matter of days after his assumption of  the Presidency, he said this is the people\u2019s money. And he\u2019s right.  But guess what? It\u2019s the people\u2019s responsibility to honor those veterans  hospitals  for 35,000 men and women  who have served us honorably in Iraq  and Afghanistan who are going to need  our care for decades to come. It\u2019s the  people\u2019s responsibility on Social Security, the greatest antipoverty program  in history. It\u2019s the people\u2019s responsibility on Medicare, which has added  years to life and life to years.  This  proposal  today  overdoes  it.  There are enough men and women of  goodwill in this institution to assemble  for the purpose of getting on to a balanced budget without taking this pursuit of dishonoring our Constitution  when we should be doing this on our  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:22 Dec 08, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\H18NO1.REC H18NO1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",
            "21": "November 18, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE H7853  Balancing a budget is not just about  how much you spend; it is also about  how much you take in. And the government\u2019s only source of taking in money  is tax revenues. So for somebody to  come in here and lecture me about a  balanced  budget  amendment,  when  they jumped up from discussions and  said, I\u2019m not going to talk about revenues in an effort to balance the budget,  I\u2019m just going to have you talk about  expenditures\u2014that is unacceptable to  me.  Let\u2019s grow up in this institution. Act  responsibly and make tough decisions,  and we can get out of this deficit situation, and we can pay off the debt. We  have proved it. We proved it while I  was here in this body. We got to the  point that Chairman Greenspan at that  time was saying, hey, I\u2019m worried that  you\u2019re going to pay off the national  debt too fast and it\u2019s going to be deflationary. Republicans were not in control then. We didn\u2019t have a balanced  budget amendment then.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. NADLER. I yield the gentleman  an additional 30 seconds.  Mr. WATT. We didn\u2019t have a balanced  budget amendment then. We acted responsibly, and not with a single vote  from the people who are here lecturing  us today and saying they need a balanced budget to stand behind. That\u2019s  like  standing  behind my mother\u2019s  skirt.  Grow up. Make responsible decisions.  Quit going into wars that we can\u2019t afford to pay  for and not paying  for  them. Make  some  responsible  decisions, and you won\u2019t need this skirt to  stand behind. We don\u2019t need this. It\u2019s  irrational. The American people know  it\u2019s irrational because they know that  balancing a budget is a function of income and expenditures.  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself 1 minute to respond to the  gentleman.  If the gentleman\u2019s complaint is that  there have been decisions made during  Republican Congresses that he doesn\u2019t  agree with that spent too much money,  that didn\u2019t yield to balancing budgets,  the gentleman is correct.  But the gentleman neglects to point  out that there have been many, many  Democratic Congresses in the last 50  years, 37 of them, of which only two of  them resulted  in a balanced budget.  That is not a good record either. In  fact, during the 1990s, when we were  fortunate enough to receive four balanced budgets, those balanced budgets  were under a Republican Congress and  a Democratic President.  b1130  In point of fact, it was only after  there was a confrontation about the  level of spending and a government  shutdown that the necessary reforms  were made to slow the rate of government  spending  so we could achieve  those balanced budgets.  The gentleman from North Carolina  takes credit for his vote in 1993, which  I did not agree with. I\u2019m going to take  credit for my four votes that were balanced budgets  in  1998  through  2001,  which he voted against. So we need bipartisan support for a rule in our Constitution that requires that the budget  be balanced every year, except in times  of national emergency when we should  have bipartisan support to not balance.  At this time  it  is my pleasure to  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. STEARNS), chairman of the  Energy and Commerce Oversight and  Investigation Subcommittee.  Mr. STEARNS. I thank my distinguished colleague.  You know, I say to my colleagues on  the Democrat side, we can sit here and  blame Bush; we can sit here, on our  side we could blame President Obama;  and we can have this high rhetoric  talking about this issue but now is the  time to get serious. But we are in a  very precarious situation. This is all  different with a debt to GDP ratio at  100 percent.  When you look at the statistics and  you say, well, look, what\u2019s going to  happen in this country in 10 years, in 10  years 95 percent of all Federal tax revenues will be consumed by payments of  interest on the national debt and mandatory programs like Social Security. I  think you would agree with that. Medicare and Medicaid are also there. This  will leave just about 5 percent of our  annual tax revenue available for funding national defense and other essential functions of the government. So  this is an attempt here today, a very  sober attempt, to control federal budgets and do this through a balanced  budget amendment.  Now, you make a valid argument  about the difference of these 49 States  having an operational balanced budget,  which is they don\u2019t have a capital outlay balanced budget. I understand that  argument. But also, with this constitutional amendment, we are projecting  an attempt to have a rainy-day fund,  where we set aside money  for these  emergencies we all worry about. So  you cannot hang your whole argument  on the difference between the state  operational budgets and a state capital  budget and a federal budget as a reason  for not voting for this because we are  at such dire extreme situations.  And talking about Founding Fathers,  they understood the perils associated  with debt. In fact, Thomas Jefferson  said, \u2018\u2018The principle of spending money  to be paid by future generations, under  the name of funding, is but swindling  futurity on a large scale.\u2019\u2019  We need to come together and understand that this is not business as usual  like when we voted for the constitutional amendment some 16 years ago.  This is a precarious moment in history.  We do not think we can go forward  without controlling our spending, and  this is a legitimate attempt to do so. I  think the high rhetoric on both sides of  blaming different Presidents and talking about the past is gone. We\u2019re talking about the future.  I urge you to support this resolution.  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, either we  will have the discipline to do what we  have to or this amendment simply puts  those decisions in the hands of a Federal judge, which we don\u2019t want to see,  I don\u2019t think.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, it is  my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  HULTGREN), a member of  the Agriculture Committee.  Mr. HULTGREN. The time is now.  This week we watched as our Nation\u2019s debt reached an unprecedented  level\u2014$15 trillion. This debt crisis was  caused by past administrations and  past Congresses who refused to say no  more spending.  Washington spends too much and is  under water. Because of that, our national security and sovereignty and the  standard of living for our children and  grandchildren are in jeopardy.  Mr. Speaker, the time is now for this  Congress to pass immediate, bold and  permanent spending reforms that will  hold all future Congresses accountable  for their spending. And now we have  the opportunity to do just that by passing a balanced budget amendment to  our Constitution. Let\u2019s forever change  the  way  that Washington  spends  money and bring accountability back  to Congress by passing the balanced  budget amendment  to  the Constitution. We\u2019ve  come  close before, but  there\u2019s no more excuses. The time is  now.  Mr. NADLER. I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, it is  my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. POSEY), a  member of the Financial Services Committee and, as a realtor, may want to  comment on some of the remarks made  here today regarding the ability of people to borrow money under certain circumstances.  Mr. POSEY. Well, first I will comment on the value of buying homes on  credit. I think it\u2019s a pretty good idea;  but when you go to get qualified for a  home, the rule of thumb is that you  should buy a home roughly not more  than 2.5 times your annual income. If  you compare that to our known debt of  $15 trillion, our revenues of about $2.2  trillion, you would see that if our debt  was a home loan, it would be 14 times  our annual income. No lender would  loan  you money  under  those  circumstances; they would say you are  bankrupt far beyond any possibility of  recovering. And that doesn\u2019t  include  the $60 trillion unfunded liabilities for  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. So I don\u2019t know if that was really a very good analogy.  Now, to my point, there is an old political axiom that says that anytime  you promise to steal from Peter to pay  Paul, one thing usually happens: Paul  votes for you. Total revenues, as I just  said in answer to the chairman\u2019s question, are about $2.2 trillion; total expenses the Federal Government spends,  $3.6 trillion.

            "29": "November 18, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE H7861  like Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid, or significant tax hikes on  the Nation\u2019s middle class. This is nothing more than a gimmick to garner  headlines while avoiding the tough decisions that the people have asked us  to make. You know,  there may be  times in the future when we need to  run a surplus, there may be times when  we need to run a deficit to stimulate  the economy. This amendment handcuffs us and puts us in a straitjacket  where we have nowhere to move.  I care and my constituents care very  much about preserving Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. I think that  if we\u2019re going to get our budget to balance, it\u2019s not only cuts in programs  that we need, although my friends on  the other side of the aisle fret about  defense cuts. We need to cut spending,  yes. We also need to raise taxes on  those who can most afford to do it, the  1 percent. I think that\u2019s something we  should consider.  So while we think this is one size fits  all, and we can all go home and say,  well, we tried to save the Republic,  what I think this does is handcuff us  for generations to come, makes it impossible for us to stimulate the economy, and makes it impossible for us to  continue those social service programs  that the American people have come to  rely on\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. I think we need to meet  in a sensible center, not have something like this that\u2019s draconian.  Let me finally say, what\u2019s truly absurd is that we require only a simple  majority to send our men and women  in uniform into harm\u2019s way, and yet  the Republican majority would require  a supermajority to raise the Nation\u2019s  debt ceiling. We all saw how close our  economy came to disaster with only a  simple majority vote to raise the debt  ceiling the last time.  So I would say to my colleagues, vote  \u2018\u2018no.\u2019\u2019 Let\u2019s do the job that we were  elected to do. Let\u2019s make the tough  choices. We  don\u2019t need  a  balanced  budget amendment.  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself 1 minute to respond to my  good friend from New York.  I would just say to the gentleman  that we do need to do the job, but you  don\u2019t have to look ahead to wonder  what\u2019s going to happen, all you have to  do is look back. Over the past 50 years  we\u2019ve balanced  the budget  just  six  times and we\u2019ve run up a $15 trillion  national debt. Now, the gentleman has  cited  some  criticism  of Republican  votes, but there are plenty of Democratic votes in the 4 years that the  Democrats were in control of this Congress. Just recently we added $4 trillion to the national debt. Now, the fact  of the matter is, over the 50 years, 37 of  those years Democrats have controlled  the House of Representatives and only  2 of those 37 years was it balanced. So  when the gentleman says that some  years will  run  surpluses  and  some  years will run deficits, that\u2019s very true,  but the history has been almost all of  those years will run deficits unless we  have a discipline in our Constitution to  require that we do otherwise.  And I would also point out that in  the 4 years since the gentleman has  been here and I\u2019ve been here we\u2019ve had  balanced budgets. The gentleman, for  I\u2019m sure reasons that he felt were very  justified, voted against all four of the  budgets that balanced in this Congress.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 2 minutes to reply to what the  gentleman just said.  The fact is, the reason this country is  in such deficit is because of a deliberate Republican crusade over the last  30 years to reduce taxes on the rich in  order to deliberately create huge deficits, and to then use those deficits as  the excuse to justify large cuts to gut  Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and education programs that they  have never liked in the first place but  could not justify cutting without it.  Taxes used to be 18 to 19 percent of  the economy, of GDP. Now  they\u2019re  about 14 percent of GDP, and yet the  Republicans won\u2019t increase it because  we have decreased the taxes on the rich  and on the corporations. The country is  not broke; we\u2019re just not taxing the  millionaires and the billionaires the  way we used to.  And the fact is, you look at the history here. When Ronald Reagan took  over as President of the United States,  the entire national debt of the United  States accumulated from George Washington through Jimmy Carter was less  than $800 billion. Then you had 12 years  of Reagan and the first Bush cutting  taxes on the rich. When Clinton took  over, you had a $4.3 trillion deficit, and  it was expected to go much higher. We  made the tough decisions; we voted for  increased taxes in 1993 and for cutting  the budget. And when Clinton left office 8 years later, the budget had been  balanced. But from the time we made  that vote in 1993, the deficit decreased  every year until it became a surplus,  then it increased every year. And when  Bush II took over, we were looking at  a $5.7 trillion surplus over the next 10  years, and we were going to pay off the  entire national  debt. Then we had  those huge Bush tax cuts and the irresponsible, unpaid-for wars. And when  Bush left office, we had a $9.5 trillion  deficit\u2014a turnaround of $15 trillion\u2014  and a recession, which causes the bigger deficits now.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. NADLER. I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.  The CBO estimated, before President  Obama took office, that the next year\u2019s  deficit would be $1.2 trillion before he  did anything. And I would remind us  that nondefense discretionary spending  in this country has not gone up by a  nickel, adjusted for inflation and population growth, since 2001, when we had  a huge surplus.  The problem is that our taxes on the  rich are too low. We cannot reach an  agreement in the supercommittee because the Republicans will not tax the  rich. That\u2019s the basic problem, and a  balanced budget amendment will not  solve that problem.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself 1 minute to respond to the  gentleman.  First of all, let me just be very clear  that when the gentleman talks about  the sins that he wants to impose upon  Republicans  for  not  balancing  the  budget, I think that\u2019s a very good argument. But since this is a bipartisan bill  and dozens of his colleagues will be  voting  for this, I think  it\u2019s because  those of us who vote for it recognize  that this is true on both sides of the  aisle, that there has been a lack of  tough decisions that have led to balanced budgets.  Every  single year  I vote  for  the  toughest budget offered in this Congress. Those budgets never pass. Why?  Because there\u2019s no requirement that  they do so. So, what do we have? We  have complaints on the other side of  the aisle that this is a terrible plot on  our part to bring about all kinds of  harsh  cuts.  This  balanced  budget  amendment doesn\u2019t make any distinction between whether you balance a  budget by  raising  taxes or  cutting  spending. I\u2019m going to do  it to cut  spending because I see lots of waste in  our government. And  I\u2019ve voted  for  budgets  that bring about a balance  without raising taxes, but that is not  the point here. The point is that it  doesn\u2019t get done either way.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman has expired.  Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield myself an  additional 30 seconds.  As to the gentleman\u2019s complaint that  this is all because we haven\u2019t taxed the  rich, my goodness, in the last Congress,  under the control of your party, you  extended all of those tax cuts for everyone. And the fact of the matter is  that the top 1 percent of American  families pay 38 percent\u201438 percent\u2014of  the personal income taxes in this country today.  b1250  That, by the way, is up from 34 percent in 2001. So all of this can be on the  table when we have a discussion about  how to balance the budget.  All we\u2019re debating here today is the  principle of whether or not we should  balance the budget and looking at the  past history where we have not, indeed,  balanced it but six times in 50 years.  Mr. Speaker, at this time it is my  pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. WEST), who is  not only a member of the House Armed  Services Committee, but a great advocate for fiscal responsibility and a balanced budget.  Mr. WEST. I want to thank my colleague from Virginia, and I want to say  that I rise in strong support of H.J.  Res. 2, which is the balanced budget  amendment.

What America needs is  to invest in those things that allow and help  our people  to be productive\u2014education,  research, health care, and things that help the  wheels of commerce  turn,  like banking and  trading regulations, environmental protection,  and  freer migration of  talented people. We  need  the  wealthiest  Americans  and  our  wealthiest corporations to pay their fair share  of  the cost of  running  this nation. And we  need to act with urgency and compassion to  put to work the 25 million Americans who are  out of work or underemployed. We need  to  create jobs in the short-term to stop the damage to our long-term economy.  Madam Speaker, our history of amending  the Constitution has been about the enhancement of individual rights or the correction of  fundamental  structural  flaws  in  the  federal  government. Politics\u2014not a structural  flaw\u2014  created our current deficit problem, and political compromise can fix it. We must be committed  to reaching  the political compromises  that are necessary in order to exercise fiscal  responsibility and balance budgets consistently.  Madam  Speaker,  a  balanced  budget  amendment is nothing more than a fine example of political  theater. We will debate  this  amendment for hours, but without any chance  to amend it or consider any alternatives. The  majority is putting the bill on the floor under a  procedure  normally  reserved  for  non-controversial measures, despite  the very controversial nature of  this  flawed constitutional  amendment. It is bad policy that will not bring  us any closer to solving our budget problems,  and I urge my colleagues to oppose it here  today.  Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Madam Speaker, I  rise  in  support  of  this Balanced Budget  Amendment.  I have always been hesitant  to support  changes to our Constitution. It is the most significant document in our Nation\u2019s history and I  am reminded of its guiding principals by the  copy I carry with me each day.  Truthfully, I wish this step had not become  so necessary. A simple majority of us in the  House, working with the Senate and the President have  the ability  to balance our budget  without this Amendment.  It has been done before. I have been honored  to serve  in  this House  for  the  last 41  years. During this time, we have managed to  balance our budget twice, and both times occurred during my tenure as Chairman of the  House Appropriations Committee.  The way we balanced the budget then was  by making  the hard, but necessary choices.  The Appropriations Committee had to say no  to many funding requests. It was not always  easy and I was not always the most popular  person around here. But we had  to do  the  right thing for the country and we did it as a  Republican House working with a Democrat  President.  In this Congress, the House and the House  Appropriations Committee have made the difis spificult decisions to cut wasteful spending, consolidate duplicative programs, and reign in the  excesses of recent years. We have reduced  excessive spending and passed a responsible  budget resolution. We have brought our bills  to the floor under regular order\u2014in contrast to  recent years. Every Member on  the Committee and in the entire House has had the  opportunity  to make  their voices heard and  offer their amendments. In fact, we have considered almost 500 amendments to appropriations bills just this year.  I am proud to say that the House has made  real progress towards fiscal responsibility. Unfortunately, much of our budget process has  become dysfunctional.  We are stuck with a Senate that has been  unwilling  to do  their part.  It has been more  than  two and a half years since  they have  completed the basic task of passing a budget.  Under  this President, spending has skyrocketed to consume more than 25 percent of  the economy. Since 2008, annual spending  has jumped by close to $1 trillion. The President\u2019s budget proposed to keep the spending  going  for  the next decade, with  spending  growing from its historical average of 18 percent to 24 percent of GDP in 2021.  We have mandatory spending  that  raling out of control.  For the first time in America\u2019s proud history,  our credit rating was downgraded because we  have been unable to come to an enforceable  agreement on how  to bring our debt under  control.  I have come to believe that the only guaranteed way to bring spending under control is to  pass this Balanced Budget Amendment. The  only way to get the entire Congress and the  President  to consistently agree on a  fiscally  responsible budget is to amend the Constitution to require it to happen. It is a common  sense proposal that has widespread support.  In 2009, I asked every voter in my district  how they felt about requiring a balanced budget and 79.64 percent of the more than 32,000  who responded  to my survey said  that  they  support it.  The National Federation  of  Independent  Businesses  recently  asked  small  business  owners in my district if they support the Balanced Budget Amendment and 78 percent responded that they do.  National polls point  to more overwhelming  support. After all,  families and small businesses across the country have to sit down  and balance  their own budgets,  just as our  state of Florida must. Why can\u2019t  the  federal  government do the same?  America has a spending problem. Just on  Wednesday our national debt topped $15 trillion. We are borrowing 43 cents for every dollar we spend. This year gross  interest payments on the debt reached $466 billion. Every  one of our children and our grandchildren already owes more than $46,000 to our creditors.  We owe it to the next generation to leave  them a better country and a better future, as  those who came before us did. It is essential  that we change  the culture of spending  in  Washington and  restore  fiscal sanity  to our  federal budget. It is crucial to the future of our  Nation  that we solve  this debt problem, because if we don\u2019t, I hate to think what might  happen to our economy, what might happen to  our currency, and what might happen to our  standing in the world.  Let me close by saying  that  to have a  strong national defense we must have a  strong robust economy.  Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker,  it  would be a mistake to believe that a Balanced  Budget Amendment  to  the Constitution will  solve all of our  fiscal woes. There are no  magic answers  to what ails us. Fiscal discipline and common sense applied day-by-  day, year-by-year are required.  A Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution would, however, help impose the discipline needed on the taxing and spending decisions of the federal government. It would be  a very significant step\u2014perhaps one of  the  most significant we could  take\u2014in  repairing  our fiscal house.  It  forces Congress and  the President  to  make choices. If new spending is proposed,  other spending must be cut or some other way  to finance the new program must be found.  A basic principle for individuals, businesses,  and other organizations is that one should not  spend more than one has to spend, except in  extraordinary circumstances. That is common  sense. Yet,  for  too  long,  that principle has  been commonly absent from Washington. This  vote on this Amendment is our opportunity to  apply  this basic  idea  to  the  federal government. We should do it now.  Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, nearly every  State in the union is required to balance its  budget each year, including my home State of  Florida. Our counties, cities, school boards  and special districts are all required to make  financially responsible decisions with the hard-  earned tax dollars of Florida\u2019s working families  and small businesses.  It is long past due for Washington to do the  same, which  is why  the Balanced Budget  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is one of  the first bills I cosponsored as a new Member  of Congress in 2009.  For 235 years, the United States has been  the greatest economic success story the world  has ever known. Yet,  the most significant  threat ever to our continued success is our unprecedented  and  rapidly  growing  national  debt. From 1776 to 2008, Washington accumulated a debt of $10.6 trillion. Yet in just the  last 3 years alone, another $4.4 trillion in debt  has been added for a grand total of $15 trillion  and counting.  Washington doesn\u2019t  just have a spending  problem.  It has an  insatiable addiction  to  spending money  it does not have and  it  is  threatening our children\u2019s  future. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff called it the  greatest threat to our Nation.  The  last  time  the House voted on and  passed a Balanced Budget Amendment to the  Constitution\u2014back in 1997\u2014the national debt  stood at $5.4 trillion. That year the Balanced  Budget Amendment fell just ONE VOTE short  of passage in the Senate. It\u2019s something I like  to call \u2018\u2018The Ten Trillion Dollar Vote.\u2019\u2019  So, you might ask: How do these gigantic  numbers relate to the American taxpayer? Because  of Washington\u2019s  failure  to  control  spending, each and every taxpayer\u2019s share of  the debt amounts to $130,000. It gets worse.  On our current path,  the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates  the national debt will reach $23 TRILLION in 2015.  That\u2019s $200,000  in debt per  taxpayer. This  must change.  The American people were promised  in  1997  that Washington would  balance  the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:22 Dec 08, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\H18NO1.REC H18NO1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",

Mr.  Speaker, this week Speaker BOEHNER  announced a bill that will be  introduced soon to Congress to deal with  our jobs issue. It\u2019s not one that raises  taxes. It\u2019s not one which is going to  add to the deficit. It is the American  Energy &  Infrastructure  Jobs Act,  which will be introduced soon.  It is an act that in part is related to  a bill that I have presented  in this  Chamber for several years now in a bipartisan move to get America back to  work.  Instead  of  importing  $129  billion  worth of oil every year and sending  them our wealth, it uses our oil off our  coasts to create jobs.  Our infrastructure in America has a  $2 trillion pricetag to repair our roads,  highways, and bridges. We also still  have 14 million Americans out of work  and another  10 million  looking  for  work. It\u2019s time America got back to  work, and we can do it with this bill. I  urge all of my colleagues to make sure  they\u2019re part of this bill when it comes  out and get Americans back to work  and rebuild America once again.  f  YUCCA MOUNTAIN  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  LANDRY). Under  the  Speaker\u2019s  announced policy of January 5, 2011, the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS)  is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I come  down to the floor once a week to talk  about the high level of nuclear waste in  this country and the  fact that this  country still doesn\u2019t have a single repository  to  store high-level nuclear  waste.  Throughout  this  last  year,  I\u2019ve  talked  about Hanford, Washington,  which has multiple gallons of high-  level nuclear waste. I then went to  Zion nuclear power plant  right off  Lake Michigan to talk about its nuclear waste right next to the lake. A  couple of weeks ago, I went to Savannah, Georgia, to talk about the Savannah River and the nuclear power plant  that sits right next to the river. Then  I went to the Pacific Ocean between  Los Angeles  and  San Diego,  San  Onofre, where there\u2019s a nuclear power  plant right on the Pacific Ocean.  Today I take the Nation to Idaho,  where Idaho National Laboratory is located, comparing  this  site, as  I do  weekly, to the fine location under FedE N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o eral law in the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act which is Yucca Mountain.  Look at what we have at Idaho National Laboratory. At the national labs  we  have  5,090  canisters  of  nuclear  waste.  Yucca Mountain,  none.  At  Idaho, the waste is stored above ground  and in pools. At Yucca Mountain, the  waste would be stored 1,000 feet from  the surface of the ground. At Idaho, the  waste would be 500 feet above the water  table. At Yucca Mountain, the waste  would be 1,000  feet above the water  table. Idaho National Laboratory, 50  miles  from Yellowstone Park; Yucca  Mountain, the waste would be 100 miles  from the Colorado River.  Now, why is it important to address  these different locations of high-level  nuclear waste across the country? Because there\u2019s 104 nuclear reactors in  this country, not including all of the  high-level nuclear waste that we have  at our defense labs, our DOE labs, and  the like.  So what this country needs to understand is there\u2019s nuclear waste all over  the place and next to major population  centers and next to major water reserves.  What I\u2019ve also done in coming down  here has been to highlight how do the  Senators  from  the States  that  surround the Idaho nuclear lab\u2014what are  their positions? And their positions are  as follows.  Senator BARRASSO from Wyoming is  a supporter of Yucca Mountain and has  stated that the end result of this saga  is a 5-mile long, 25-foot-wide hole in  the Nevada desert. It was meant to  store America\u2019s nuclear waste but instead, because of politics, it stands as a  monument  to bureaucratic waste of  taxpayer dollars.  What does Senator ENZI say, who\u2019s  also supported and voted  for Yucca  Mountain in 2002?  \u2018\u2018In his campaign,  President Obama promised change. He  promised  politics wouldn\u2019t  interfere  when  sound  science  spoke.  I\u2019m disappointed  that his Yucca Mountain  policy ignores that campaign promise.\u2019\u2019  voted \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 for Yucca  Mountain, and he\u2019s disappointed in the  administration.  And the new Senator  Senator RISCH, says:  \u2018\u2018The President\u2019s decision to kill the  Nation\u2019s congressionally directed repository for high-level nuclear waste as  a favor to one State is politics at its  worst. The Administration\u2019s decision  to knowingly undermine their commitments to Idaho and 33 other States  with no clear alternative cannot stand.  This has become a hallmark of this administration,  first with the Guantanamo prison site and now Yucca Mountain\u2014to jump without knowing where  they are going to land.\u2019\u2019  b1420  The other thing I\u2019ve been doing has  just been highlighting, as  I\u2019ve been  taking the country through the high-  level nuclear waste areas around this  country: Where are the Senators based  MIKECRAPO Idaho,  from  upon their past votes or current statements?  Right now, we have 17 Senators in  support; we have three in opposition;  and we have four who really have no  defined positions as of yet. Senator  FEINSTEIN, of course, has spoken in opposition to Yucca Mountain; but with  Fukushima Daiichi and with the fact  that she has nuclear power plants on  the shore of the Pacific Ocean, I think  she is reevaluating that position.  We need 60 votes in the Senate to  move forward and to finish the science  on Yucca Mountain so that, by Federal  law, Yucca Mountain becomes the single repository  for high-level nuclear  waste in this country.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back  the balance of my time.  f  COMMERCE CLAUSE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  Chair reallocates the balance of the  majority  leader\u2019s  time  to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BROUN).  Mr. BROUN of Georgia. In Hosea 4:6,  God says:  My people are destroyed  from  lack of  knowledge.  Because  you  have  rejected  knowledge, I also reject you as My priests;  because you have ignored the law of your  God, I also will ignore your children.  This is a promise from a holy, righteous God who could do nothing else but  fulfill that promise. We have to look at  this and understand that, in this country, we have a  tremendous  lack of  knowledge about our U.S. Constitution  and that we have a tremendous lack of  knowledge about the biblical foundations of our Nation and of how our  Founding Fathers believed in liberty.  We\u2019re losing that liberty tremendously  because we have a tremendous lack of  knowledge.  In Psalm 11, God says:  If the foundations are destroyed, what are  the righteous to do?  I believe it\u2019s a call to duty to rebuild  the foundational principles that are behind liberty.  Sworn officers of the United States\u2014  in fact, all public servants\u2014have taken  an oath to uphold the Constitution  against enemies both foreign and domestic; and for decades, sworn officers  of the United States have been violating that oath to uphold and protect  our Nation\u2019s most precious document,  the U.S. Constitution. Domestically,  there are many by their actions, either  intentionally or unintentionally, who  undermine our governing document.  Every day, officials,  ranging  from  Federal  judges  to U.S. Senators  to  Members of the House to leadership, ignore the original intent of our Founders that was put in the Constitution of  the United States. The distortion is so  great now that there is little correlation between their words and our actions here in Washington, D.C. This has  become the norm for today\u2019s body of  government, but it was not what the  great lawmakers of the past envisioned  for America\u2019s future.  l a e n b j VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:22 Dec 08, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\RECORD11\\RECFILES\\H18NO1.REC H18NO1         ",

This  is  from James Madison,  the  fourth President,  1815. Many  credit  James Madison as being the most productive person in the writing of our  United States Constitution. The greatest building block for any Nation in  the history of man.  This is James Madison\u2019s proclamation:  No people ought to feel greater obligations  to celebrate the goodness of the Great Disposer of Events of the Destiny of Nations  than the people of the United States. His  kind providence originally conducted them  to one of the best portions of the dwelling  place allotted for the great family of the  human  race. He protected and cherished  them under all the difficulties and trials to  which they were exposed in their early days.  Under His fostering care their habits, their  sentiments,  and  their  pursuits  prepared  them for a transition in due time to a state  of independence and self-government.  Signed James Madison, fourth President, March 4, 1850, Thanksgiving Day  proclamation.  And then in conclusion:  Know that the Lord Himself is God; It is  He who has made us, and not we ourselves;  We are His people and the sheep of His pasture. Enter His gates with thanksgiving and  His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him,  bless His name. For the Lord is good; His  loving kindness is everlasting and His faithfulness to all generations.  Mr. Speaker, it is the wish here that  you and all those  in this body and  around the country have a wonderful  day  of Thanksgiving  ahead.  With that, I yield back the balance of  my time.  the week  in  f  THE FAIR TAX  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under  the Speaker\u2019s announced policy of January 5, 2011, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL) is recognized for 30  minutes.  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, this is  my first time down here as a freshman  during Special Orders, my first time  trying to coordinate charts and talk  the talk and walk the walk all at the  same time.  But I\u2019m excited about it because I\u2019m  down here to talk about the Fair Tax.  And if folks don\u2019t know what the Fair  Tax is, it\u2019s H.R. 25. You can find it at  www.thomas.gov, that site that everybody should have bookmarked if you  care about what goes on here on the  House floor. Because if you don\u2019t know,  everything that goes on here is available in realtime at www.thomas.gov.  It\u2019s done through the Library of Congress. It\u2019s not a Republican thing or a  Democrat thing. It\u2019s just the real deal,  what\u2019s actually happening down here.  And if you go and you look up H.R.  25, it\u2019s the Fair Tax. What the Fair Tax  is  is a bill that repeals all  income-  based Federal taxes and replaces them  with consumption-based taxes.  Now, my  friend  from Texas  (Mr.  GOHMERT) was just down here on the  House floor, Mr. Speaker. He was talking about our Founding Fathers and  those things that were happening between 1776 and 1787. And in that time,  we funded all the Federal Government  with consumption taxes\u2014it was not income taxes; it was consumption taxes\u2014  under  the  theory  that  if you had  enough resources to go out and buy  that silver tea set from England, then  you had enough resources to help fund  the Republic. And if you spent all your  time working on your farm, and you  just barely had enough money to buy  thread at the local five-and-dime, then  we weren\u2019t going to tax you as heavily.  b1550  If you look at this poster, Mr. Speaker, in 1913, right before the income tax  began, we had 400 pages of Tax Code in  America. Just the last century, in the  1900s, 400 pages of Tax Code and regulations. By World War II, that 400 pages  had grown to 8,000 pages, 20 times as  much Tax Code by the end of World  War II. By the time we were in Korea,  14,000 pages of code and regulation. By  the 1970s, 19,000 pages of code and regulation. And in the 1980s, 26,300 pages of  Tax Code and regulation.  Now, Mr. Speaker, I\u2019m a reader. I  love to sit down and educate myself  through the written word; but I have to  tell you, 26,000 pages of Tax Code and  regulation is going to make a criminal  out of all of us because you can\u2019t possibly understand all of the ramifications of the tax consequences of your  decision.  Do you remember 1986? That was the  last time we fundamentally overhauled  the Tax Code. 1986. In fact, if you go to  www.Thomas.gov, like I suggested, and  you look at the laws and regulations,  you\u2019ll see the Tax Code of 1986. It was  the Tax Code of 1954, updated Tax Code  to 1986. That was the last time we flattened rates and broadened the basis.  Flattened the rates and broadened the  base. And where did we end up? Between 1984 when we had 26,000 pages of  Tax Code  and  regulation, we went  through this process of simplifying the  income tax, and 10 years later in 1995,  we have 40,000 pages of Tax Code. By  simplifying the income tax, we grew it  from 26,000 pages to 40,000 pages.  Now, Mr. Speaker, if you\u2019re like me,  you go out and you shop around. Are  you going to use the H&R Block tax  software? Are you going to use the  Microsoft tax software? What kind of  tax software are you going to use, because you hate paying accountants to  do your taxes for you.  You know, I used to just sit down  with a pen and paper and do it myself.  I used to go through with my calculator and do it myself, but it has gotten  too  complicated. Why? Because  since I have reached the age of majority in 1988, here we have 1995 when I\u2019m  coming out of college, between 1995 and  2004, we added another 20,000 pages to  the Tax Code,  from  40,000 pages  to  60,000 pages. In 2007, to 67,000 pages;  2008 kept it to just a little over 67,000  pages. And in 2009, it jumped another  3,000 pages; 70,000 pages of tax legislation.  And to be clear, Mr. Speaker, when  we talk about tax  legislation, we\u2019re  talking about the ways in which the  government separates you and me and  all of the American people from our  paycheck. That\u2019s all there is in the Tax  Code. All the Tax Code is, is how do we  separate  the American people  from  their  productivity?  It  takes  70,000  pages  in 2009 to sort that out. And  71,000 pages  in 2010. And now, 72,000  pages of Tax Code in 2011.  Folks, what the FAIR Tax does, H.R.  25, it asks the question that if we could  start from scratch\u2014and by scratch I  mean from the 72,000 pages that we do  today, to just a blank sheet of paper\u2014  if you could start  from scratch and  draft the Tax Code that America ought  to have instead of the one that has  been forced upon us, what would you  do? What would you do?  Well, there\u2019s a lot of difference of  opinion on what to do, but simplification seems to be one of those things  that we can all agree on.  You know,  I didn\u2019t come  to  this  House to try to be a good Republican.  I came to this House to try to be a good  American, and there are lots of opportunities to do that. I  like to think  those  things  occur  simultaneously  more often than not. But look at what  folks  are  saying  about  the United  States Tax Code.

            "69": "S7792  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE November 18, 2011  these loopholes is that Buy American  does not apply to DOD-purchased solar  on DOD property.  The amendment I am offering today,  on behalf of myself and Senator SCHUMER, closes these loopholes and applies  Buy American  requirements  to  all  solar panels that are part of contracts  with DOD.  If American taxpayer funds are used  to improve our military bases\u2019 energy  security, American solar firms should  have an ability to compete.  We know  that other nations  like  China are spending vast resources to  become leaders in the solar power market. They do not play by our trade  rules, and they are taking advantage of  our taxpayer funds.  This amendment halts that practice,  while maintaining all existing provisions of the Buy American Act: nations  who are in the WTO are not discriminated against and existing exemptions  such  as  availability  and  cost  still  apply.  Our amendment  is supported by a  strong coalition of U.S. solar manufacturers, many of which are based overseas,  and U.S. workers  and  labor  unions.  I thank Sen. SCHUMERand his staff  for their work on this and I urge the  Senate\u2019s support.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from  New Mexico for his remarks. I agree  with him; it was a lively debate. I also  agree with him it is to be desired that  kind of debate occurs more often in the  Senate. The Senator from New Mexico  has been very active in the effort to  have these kinds of debates by rules  changes, which would make  these  kinds of debates a lot more likely, and  by other mechanisms.  To make an inquiry, did the Senator  from New Mexico restore the regular  order  to  the Levin-McCain  amendment? I missed that.  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I did. Let  me say to Chairman LEVIN, not only  lively, robust, but very informative. I  learned a lot in the process of listening  to him and to Senator MCCAINand Senator DURBIN and the other Senators  who came down about  the  issue.  I  think that is the way the Senate works  best: to have the amendments and various provisions of the Defense authorization bill be a part of a lively and informative debate.  I thank the Senator for that, and I  yield the floor.  Mr. MCCAIN. Mr. President,  I assume, then, having watched the debate  and been informed, that the Senator  from New Mexico now takes the position that Senator LEVIN and I do on  this issue, and his next mission is to  convince his colleague from Colorado  of the correctness of our position?  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. At this  point I am still listening and trying to  ascertain as much as I can about the  actual provisions of the Defense authorization bill. But the Senator is correct. There could be trouble in Udall  Valley. There might be a split. We do  not see that yet, but there is a possibility of it.  Mr. MCCAIN.  One  thing  I  have  learned about the Senator from New  Mexico is that he does give all issues a  fair and objective hearing. He listens  and he pays attention and he is informed in his decisions. I thank him for  taking part in this one.  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I also  know that when the two of my colleagues\u2014when the chairman and Senator MCCAIN, the ranking member\u2014  come together on a prevision and are  able to persuade their committee to go  with  it, that says something to the  Senate itself, to have that before the  Senate. I want to study it very carefully.  I know Senator GRAHAM was  down here, who has been very active on  this  issue  and  has  a  tremendous  amount of experience. I look forward to  the continuing debate, and I yield the  floor.  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank  the Senator from New Mexico again for  the comments, but also tell him how  very much impressed I have been right  from the first day I heard him with his  openmindedness on subjects. It is very  important that we keep open minds,  and he has shown just how to do that.  We appreciate that on an issue this  complex, particularly on the Defense  bill.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the  roll.  Mr. MCCAIN. Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent the order for the  quorum call be rescinded.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. MCCAIN. Mr. President, our staff  is working  on  various  amendments  that we could get approved by both  sides. We think there are a number of  those on which we can get agreement  to make progress today. While we are  going through that process, I would  like to point out the front page of this  morning\u2019s Wall Street Journal, I am  sorry to note, may be a harbinger of  events that will happen in the future,  that will  take place  in  the  future,  which will  be  unfortunate  for  the  United States of America and indeed  tragic for Iraq.  The  front page of the Wall Street  Journal today says \u2018\u2018Standoff Over U.S.  Airbase in Iraq.\u2019\u2019  A tense standoff between local police and  the Iraqi Army played out on Thursday at  the gate of the U.S. airbase in the northern  city of Kirkuk, where a dispute over land  and oil  threatens national  stability and  unity as U.S. forces withdraw.  The territorial conflict, between the central government in Baghdad and the semiautonomous Kurdistan region,  is  just one  flash point that some American and Iraqi officials say could boil over after the full pullout of U.S. troops at the end of December.  Fears of a clash between Iraqi troops and  Kurdish forces were heightened on Thursday  when  the  Kurdish-dominated  police  in  Kirkuk blocked  senior  Iraqi Army  commanders from entering the airbase, where  they said they were planning to take over  the facility from the U.S. military.  The Army officials brought reporters from  Iraqi State-owned television to document  the handover, in what appeared to be an effort to show the nation that Baghdad was in  charge. The central government, headed by  Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, is increasingly eager to project its power ahead of the  U.S. pullout.  This is about a volatile region, particularly in the area around Kirkuk,  which is also symptomatic of the entire  northern  Iraq  border  between  Kurdistan, the semiautonomous region  of Iraq, and the rest of Iraq. The area is  inhabited by different ethnic groups  that range from Turkmen to Arab to  other nationalities who all inhabit the  area. One of the reasons some of us  wanted to have a residual force remain  in Iraq\u2014one of actually three major  reasons\u2014was because of the tensions in  this area which have already bubbled  up on several occasions. In fact, there  was a point some months ago where  two forces were\u2014the Pershmaga, the  Kurdish military, and the Iraqi military\u2014close  to a  shooting  situation.  The U.S. forces intervened. Obviously,  they are not going to be there. Obviously, already before they have even  left there has been a tense standoff at  one of the major airbases in Iraq.  I greatly  fear\u2014I pray not, but  I  greatly fear that we will see more and  more of these kinds of tensions between the Kurdish area and the rest of  Iraq. A lot of it has to do with oil. A lot  of it has to do with who is going to control the oil revenues in the area. Other  parts go back to the era of Saddam  Hussein, where he moved out Kurdish  individuals and others and moved in  people who were loyal to him. There  are still enormous land disputes in the  area as well. Suffice to say, it is a place  of great tension. I continue to be deeply worried about this kind of tension  which could lead to armed conflict, but  also over time, in the view of some,  could lead to an actual breakup of Iraq  into Kurdish areas, Sunni areas, and  even two different Shia areas of Iraq.  I am sorry to see this. I am sorry this  is happening and that there are more  people who are predicting greater tensions in the area, but I have to say, I  am surprised. I am not surprised. The  sad thing about all this\u2014I had a rather,  shall I say, spirited exchange with the  Secretary of Defense the other day in  the hearing that was held in the Armed  Services Committee. This isn\u2019t a policy  matter, this is a not an issue of whether we should have French fries served  in school lunches. This is an issue we  have shed the blood of well over 4,400  young Americans. I greatly fear that  the opportunity  that was purchased  with  their expenditure of American  blood and  treasure may go all  for  naught because of our failure to maintain a residual force in Iraq which, I repeat, was always envisioned when the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:39 Nov 19, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A18NO6.013 S18NOPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",

(B) Any analysis or report generated by  the Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance system or which  is derived  from  Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance data.  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I  offer an amendment to the National  Defense  Authorization  Act,  NDAA,  that would address an overbroad exemption to the Freedom of Information  Act, FOIA, contained in the bill. This  amendment is supported by a broad coalition  of  open  government  groups  from across the political spectrum. I  hope that the Senate will adopt it.  For 45 years, the Freedom of Information Act has been a cornerstone of  open government and a hallmark of our  democracy, ensuring that the American people have access to their government\u2019s records. My amendment will  help ensure that FOIA remains a viable  tool for access to information that impacts  the health and  safety of  the  American public.  I am concerned that the exemption  included in the NDAA would allow the  Department of Defense to keep secret  important information that Americans  need to know to protect their own  health and safety. For example, there  have been alarming reports about the  Department of Defense keeping citizens in the dark about health hazards,  such as groundwater contamination on  military  facilities, by claiming that  this information was a matter of national security. While I certainly understand the need for the government  to keep certain sensitive information  confidential, I believe this exemption  goes too far.  This amendment adds a public interest balancing test to the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s determination about whether  to withhold critical infrastructure information from the public. This change  will help ensure that truly sensitive information is protected, while allowing  the public to obtain important information  about  potential  health  and  safety concerns. An essentially identical provision  is  contained  in  the  House-passed version of this bill.  The amendment I offer today will  also revise the language in section 1044  related to Military Flight Operations  Quality Assurance Systems to ensure  that truly sensitive flight information  is protected, while maintaining  the  public\u2019s interest in obtaining information about the safety of military aircraft.  This amendment strikes an appropriate balance between  safeguarding  the ability of the Department of Defense to perform its vital missions and  the public\u2019s right to know. I hope that  all Senators will support this commonsense amendment and that the Senate  will adopt it without delay.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of a  letter  in  support of  this  amendment be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  NOVEMBER17, 2011.  DEARSENATORS: On behalf of the undersigned organizations, we are writing to urge  you to support an amendment offered by  Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) to fix an over-  broad and ill-defined provision relating to  \u2018\u2018critical  infrastructure  information,\u2019\u2019  in  Section 1044 of the National Defense Authorization Act that could prevent the public  from having access to critical health and security information.  Section 1044, as written in the bill passed  by the Senate Armed Services Committee,  grants the Secretary of Defense, or his delegate, the authority to expand protections  from public disclosure for any information  that could result in the  \u2018\u2018disruption, degradation, or destruction\u2019\u2019 of Department of  Defense (DoD) operations, property, or facilities. The language defining \u2018\u2018critical infrastructure information\u2019\u2019 is exceedingly broad,  encapsulating information that is crucial for  the public to understand public health and  safety risks and  information already protected under one of the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s (FOIA) other exemptions.  We believe that the provision is intended  to address agency concerns about protecting  information since the Supreme Court threw  out the broad use of FOIA Exemption Two in  Milner v. Department of Navy. Granting DoD  carte-blanche to withhold information under  an exceedingly broad and ill-defined rubric of  \u2018\u2018critical infrastructure information\u2019\u2019 is not  the right step, especially given that DoD has  misused such authority to hide information  in the past.  Between 1957 and 1987, the United States  Marine Corps knowingly allowed as many as  one million Marines and their family members at Camp Lejeune to be exposed to a host  of toxic chemicals, including known human  carcinogens benzene and vinyl chloride. Civilian employees who worked on the base  and people who  live  in the communities  around the base near Jacksonville, NC, are  now reporting a high incidence of cancers.  For years, the Marine Corps kept this secret,  blocking many attempts  to uncover  the  truth\u2014even after the first news of water contamination broke in 1987. Many FOIA requests for information about the contamination were denied, sometimes using Exemption Two in a way that is no longer allowable after this year\u2019s Milner decision. The  entire truth about the incident only came to  light in part from information accidentally  (and temporarily) posted on the internet by  the Marine Corps.  We support language in Senator Leahy\u2019s  proposed  amendment  that  helps  protect  against such cover-ups by requiring DoD to  weigh whether there is an over-riding public  interest in disclosing the information and  further protects public health and safety by  tightening the definition of \u2018\u2018critical infrastructure security information\u2019\u2019 to make it  clear that the Secretary may withhold only  information  that  could  substantially  increase effectiveness of a terrorist attack.  The Leahy Amendment also would slightly  modify another exemption to FOIA in Section 1044 for information in the data files of  the Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance System, which we support, though  we would prefer it to be further narrowed or  stricken altogether.  We urge you to pass the Leahy Amendment  to narrow the overly-broad Section 1044, and  welcome an opportunity to discuss this issue  with you further.

Mr. President, I do  believe the Defense authorization bill  has been moved in the way more legislation needs to be handled in the Congress. I am confident that is in large  part due to the leadership of Senator  LEVIN, who is a professional, skilled  lawyer, who knows the big picture and  the small details of the legislation. It  has been a pleasure to work with him  over the years. I have learned a great  deal about our defense from him and  how legislation is enacted. So I want to  express my appreciation for that.  And I thank Senator MCCAIN, who  brings a vast knowledge of defense and  military issues, and who is courageous  in defending what he believes the legitimate interests of the United States  are. That has been a real pleasure.  I will join Senator LEVINin thanking  Senator AYOTTEfor her leadership. Her  contributions to our committee have  been immediate, and that is reflected  in the fact that Senator MCCAINhas  asked her to manage the floor today  for him. I also appreciate the Senator\u2019s  work on the budget and the effort we  have made there.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish  to share a few general comments about  where we are. All of us have been confronting, whether we want to or not\u2014I  think some of us more realistically  than others\u2014the debt situation this  Nation faces. We are, indeed, borrowing  40 cents of every $1 we spend. That is  an unsustainable path. We have already had 3 consecutive years of deficits exceeding $1 trillion, and we are  projected to have another trillion-dollar deficit next year.  The debt under President Obama has  now increased by 42 percent in the first  3 years of his term in office. It is an  unsustainable course. We have to do  better.  The National Defense Authorization  Act represents our committee\u2019s vision  for defense in the future. We have done  something about the spending problem  America has. As we calculate the numbers, we are down from $548 billion\u2014in  actual money spent on the Defense Department last year\u2014to $527 billion this  year, an actual reduction, in noninflation-adjusted dollars, of over $20 billion, which represents about a 5-percent reduction, a 4-percent reduction in  defense spending.

Without  objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning  business.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without  objection, it is so ordered.  THENATIONALDEBT  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I was sorry  to hear the supercommittee is in trouble, that they might not be able to  agree. Then this morning\u2019s Washington  Post  front page headline was  \u2018\u2018Debt  Panel  Failure Won\u2019t  Cause  Catastrophe.\u2019\u2019  Every day we do not find a solution,  every day we spend is a catastrophe.  We have maxed out our credit cards.  Here is one way that came to my attention. I was traveling in Wyoming  and I checked into the hotel for the  night. The person checking me in, very  embarrassed, said: I am sorry, but it  will not take your credit card. It was a  Federal credit card.  I said: Goodness, we are in more trouble than I thought. I gave them my  personal credit card and  that went  right through so I am not sure where  we are. But I know we have maxed out  our credit cards and not just that but  also the symbolic credit cards that we  have. We have as much debt as we  probably can sustain and as debt comes  due across the world for other countries,  it  is going to be tougher and  tougher to be able to sell more debt.  We are kind of in the same situation  as Greece and Italy, except  for two  things. No. 1 is we are a big, flexible  country that has pulled itself out of  terrible  situations  time  and  time  again, and we will do it this time too.  We also own our own money supply.  That helps.  When constituents ask what can they  expect, I always start the conversation  by saying you should expect to get no  more than what the 2008 level was. We  increased  things  considerably  after  that with the stimulus bill and that increased some bases. We have to get  back down to 2008, just as a beginning.  I have to say the President has had a  chance to change direction. I have to  congratulate the President for naming  a deficit commission. I even like the  people he named to it, with Senator  Simpson  from Wyoming and Erskine  Bowles heading up that committee. I  think they did some tremendous work.  I think we should pay more attention  to what they had to say.  I had a little disappointment when  the President did his State of  the  Union speech following their report. He  had an opportunity to repaint the same  bleak picture that committee painted  and America would have understood  better. Although from traveling across  our country, and particularly in Wyoming, I know the people there understand it better than Congress does. But  he could have changed it by repainting  that picture and then he could have  followed it up with a solution which  would have been his budget. Instead,  his budget was another stimulus plan.  It has been voted on by Congress. It  was not voted for by Congress, it was  voted on by Congress, and it was voted  97 to nothing\u2014it was defeated. I think  the deficit commission report would  have done much better.  Congress has also had the chance to  change direction\u2014and in some cases we  have. We have kind of eliminated earmarks. There are still some of them  that are slipped  in, but we kind of  eliminated them. We have a couple new  problems. Now we add demonstration  projects. We have always had demonstration projects, but now we do it as  a substitute for earmarks and that is  where we allow maybe five States to  have an opportunity to do a particular  program to see if it works. So we fund  it in a minimal amount\u2014that still is  millions. The difficulty is that at the  end of the period of time for that demonstration project, they all work. They  are all spectacular. They all would save  America if we just put it in every single State and funded it from the Federal Government.  It can\u2019t happen. We are out of money.  There are lots of good ideas out there,  lots of good  ideas that would help.  When those ideas are proved\u2014the idea  with  the  demonstration  is  that  it  would demonstrate well enough how  good it is that somewhere at the local  level that project would be picked up  and done or forgotten. But, no, we do  make them a national program and we  do  fund  them  forever  in chunks of  time.  Another thing we are doing is that  we propose a project and, because we  like the word  \u2018\u2018pay-for,\u2019\u2019 because we  should pay for whatever we are doing,  we put up a project, we put a 2-year  limit on the project, and then we pick  a pay-for by showing some program  that, if it were eliminated for 10 years,  might bring in that amount of revenue.  We cannot pay for a 2-year program  with 10 years\u2019 worth of revenue because  somebody is going to spend the rest of  that anyway and it may never be collected. A Congress can change its mind  all the time. We have to quit using  gimmicks and we have to quit adding  new programs. What part of maxed out  credit cards don\u2019t we understand? We  have to quit buying votes with dollars  we do not have.  We do have to address mandatory  spending. Social Security and Medicare  have been a problem for a long time. I  remember when I first came to Congress, President Clinton was the President and he called for a special conference on Social Security. We had 1  day where we got to be initiated into  what all the problems were\u2014fantastic  speakers. We had a second day where  Members of the House and Congress  met in smaller committees to work on  pieces of the Social Security problem.  We came up with a plan and President  Clinton  looked at the plan and met  with us as a group and said: If all of  you are willing to put your fingerprint  on this, we will do it. We can only do it  if everybody puts their fingerprint on  it so both parties are responsible for it,  and everybody in the room agreed to do  that.  Unfortunately, we were distracted a  little bit by something called Monica  Lewinsky, and that bill never came up  anywhere.  The situation we are in right now is  passing bills to fail. Each side has a  tendency to put up a bill that has  something good in it, packaged with  something they like but the other side  doesn\u2019t like. It is going to get defeated  on the basis of what each side doesn\u2019t  like and the good part is left out. That  is not going to get anything done for  us.  We have tried the stimulus bill. We  got negligible effects on jobs. It did escalate the basis for budgets and it was  the use of one-time money. That has  created some problems for it. We hear  that 30,000 teachers and firefighters are  going to be laid off. That comes from  safety money and  education money  that went to the States. It was one-  time money. They cannot use one-time  money for a continuing contract. If a  State did, yes, they are having to lay  off people because the stimulus is not  being repeated each and every year.  Are there solutions? Yes, there are  solutions. I am optimistic about the solutions. I do recognize everything has  to be on the table and we should all  reread the deficit commission report.  We have to ask constituents to suggest  their own programs to reduce.  In the spring, we will be inundated by  a whole lot of people who will be ready  to have us support the program that  makes a difference in their life and the  life of the community. I always ask  them how we are going to pay for it?  They always suggest somebody else\u2019s  program to cancel. There are never any  suggestions of how to consolidate within their own program and do it. They  have to do it and each of us in Congress  needs to evaluate our own programs.  Not all of them can be sacred cows. I  wish  to congratulate Senator RUBIO  and Senator COONS for a jobs creation  bill they have put together. They have  taken the diverse bills from both sides  of the aisle and several others and  looked to see if there was any common  thread. All they did was pick out the  common thread from each of those and  put them into a bill. If both sides and  others in Congress like it, why would  that not pass and pass quickly?  I congratulate our Congresswoman  LUMMIS, from Wyoming. She is on the  Appropriations  Committee.  I  think  that is the first time we have ever had  anybody on the Appropriations Committee. She gets into the details of the  budget. In fact, she has gotten into details of the budget down to very small  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:56 Nov 19, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G18NO6.048 S18NOPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",
            "101": "S7824  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE November 18, 2011  Let me offer some examples of how  this might work.  An employee of the U.S. Agency for  International  Development,  USAID,  who specializes in development strategy could rotate to a DOD counterinsurgency office to advise DOD in planning on how development issues should  be taken into account in military operations, while a DOD counterinsurgency  specialist could rotate to USAID to advise  on how  development  priorities  should be assessed in a counterinsurgency.  A Treasury employee who does terrorist finance work could benefit from  a rotation to Department of Justice to  understand operations to take down  terrorist cells and how  terrorist  finance work can help identify and prosecute their members, while a Justice  employee would have the chance to  learn from the Treasury\u2019s financial expertise in understanding how sources of  funding can affect cells\u2019 formation and  plotting.  An HHS employee who specializes in  public health could rotate to a DOD  counterinsurgency office to advise on  improving public health in order to win  over the hearts and minds of the population to counter insurgency, while a  DHS employee could rotate to HHS in  order to learn about HHS\u2019s work to  prepare the U.S. public health system  for a biological terrorist attack.  The cosponsors of this amendment  and  I  recognize  the  complexity  involved in the creation of interagency  communities of interest, the institution of rotations across a wide variety  of government agencies, and having a  rotation as a prerequisite for selection  to certain Senior Executive Service positions. As a  result, our  legislation  gives the executive branch substantial  flexibility\u2014including to identify interagency  communities of  interest;  to  identify which positions in each agency  are within a particular  interagency  community  of  interest;  to  identify  which positions in an interagency community of interest should be open for  rotation and how  long the rotations  will be; and, finally, which Senior Executive Service positions have  interagency  rotational  service as a prerequisite.  To be clear, this legislation does not  mandate that any agency be included  in an interagency community of interest or the interagency personnel rotations; instead, this legislation permits  the executive branch to  include any  agency or part of an agency as the executive branch determines that our Nation\u2019s national and homeland security  missions require.  Finally, I wish to stress that this  amendment  is designed to be  implemented with no cost to the executive  branch.  First, this amendment is designed to  be implemented without requiring any  additional personnel for the executive  branch. The amendment envisions that  rotations will be conducted so that  there is a reasonable equivalence between the number of personnel rotating out of an agency and the number  rotating in. That way, no agency will  be short staffed as a result of having  sent its best and brightest to do rotations; each agency will be receiving the  best and brightest from other agencies.  Second, this amendment relies on the  office that is currently implementing  the executive branch\u2019s national security professional development program  to  implement  this  framework  instituted by this amendment. This office is  currently housed at DOD, and the legislation would move the office and its  three employees to the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of  Personnel Management, which  have  oversight responsibility for this framework. Thus, no new staff would be required to administer the framework set  forth in the amendment.  Third, this amendment has a 5-year  implementation period which requires  the executive branch  to create  two  interagency communities of interest\u2014  for emergency management, and stabilization and  reconstruction\u2014to  restrict the number of personnel doing  rotations to 20 to 25 per year per each  of these two interagency communities  of interest, and to restrict the rotations to within a metropolitan area in  order to avoid any relocation costs.  Fourth,  this  amendment  requires  that personnel doing a rotation receive  the  same  training by  the  receiving  agency  that  the  receiving  agency  would provide to its own new employees, rather than more elaborate training that would incur costs.  And fifth, this amendment requires  that any reports produced pursuant to  the amendment be submitted on line  rather than published in hard copy.  Let me close by answering a common  objection  to government  reorganization. To quote the 9/11 Commission:  An argument against change is that the  nation is at war, and cannot afford to reorganize in midstream. But some of the main innovations of the 1940s and 1950s, including  the creation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and  even the construction of the Pentagon itself,  were undertaken in the midst of war. Surely  the country cannot wait until the struggle  against Islamic terrorism is over.  I urge my colleagues to take bold action to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our government in countering 21st century national security  and  homeland  security  threats  by  promptly adopting this amendment to  the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2012.  f  OF  JACKSON-VANIK  RESTRICTIONS  ON  REPEAL  TRADE  MOLDOVA  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise in  support of an amendment to the National  Defense  Authorization  Act,  which would repeal the Cold War-era  Jackson-Vanik  trade  restrictions on  Moldovan products and thereby provide  impetus for closer U.S. strategic engagement between our two nations.  I have introduced this legislation in  the previous three Congresses and believe that the time is ripe for Moldova  to finally be granted permanent normal trade relations. Moldova has been  in the WTO since 2001 but still remains  subject to Jackson-Vanik, despite currently being in full compliance with  Jackson-Vanik-related concerns. Until  the United States terminates application of Jackson-Vanik on Moldova, the  U.S. will not benefit from Moldova\u2019s  market access commitments nor can it  resort to WTO dispute resolution mechanisms. While all other WTO members  currently  enjoy  these  benefits,  the  United States does not.  The Republic of Moldova has been  evaluated every year and granted normal trade relations with the United  States  through  annual  presidential  waivers from the effects of Jackson-  Vanik.  The Moldovan  constitution  guarantees  its citizens  the  right  to  emigrate and this right is respected in  practice. Most emigration restrictions  were eliminated in 1991 and virtually  no problems with emigration have been  reported since independence. More specifically, Moldova does not impose emigration restrictions on members of the  Jewish community. Synagogues function openly and without harassment.  As a result, several past administrations, including this one, have found  that Moldova is in full compliance with  Jackson-Vanik\u2019s provisions.  The United States and Moldova have  established a strong record of achievement in security and non-proliferation  cooperation.  We  have  encouraged  Moldova\u2019s ambition of European integration, particularly  in  light of the  new coalition that was swept to power  in 2009, the Alliance for European Integration.  One of the areas where we can deepen  U.S.-Moldovan  relations  is  bilateral  trade. In light of its adherence to freedom of emigration requirements, compliance with threat reduction and cooperation  in the global war on terrorism, the products of Moldova should  not be subject to the sanctions of Jackson-Vanik.  The continued support and encouragement of the United States and the  international community will be key  to  encouraging  the Government  of  Moldova to follow through on important reforms. The permanent waiver of  Jackson-Vanik and establishment of  permanent normal trade relations will  be the  foundation on which  further  progress  in a burgeoning  economic,  trade, and security partnership can be  made.  I am hopeful that my colleagues will  join me in supporting this important  amendment.  f  FDIC  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President,  I  rise today to bring to the Senate an  issue of critical importance.

            "109": "S7832  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE November 18, 2011  this \u2018\u2018state of affairs is not good for investors, for the auditing profession, or  for the public at large.\u2019\u2019  In one example, an accounting firm  that was subject to a disciplinary proceeding continued to  issue no  fewer  than  29 additional audit  reports on  public companies without any of those  companies knowing about the PCAOB  proceedings. Those public companies  and their investors were completely in  the dark about the board\u2019s decision to  both institute disciplinary proceedings  and about the progress of those proceedings. The auditor knew about the  proceedings, but the investors and public companies were denied information  that was arguably very relevant to the  audit relationship.  There are additional reasons that the  proceedings should be open and transparent. First, the closed proceedings  run counter to the public proceedings  of other oversight bodies, as I have already noted. Indeed, nearly all administrative proceedings brought by the  SEC against public companies, brokers,  dealers, investment advisers, and others are open, public proceedings.  The PCAOB\u2019s secret proceedings are  not only shielded from the public, but  from Congress as well. The public and  Congress have a role in ensuring that  not just auditors are held to account,  but also that the PCAOB is held to account as well for its oversight of the  auditors and audit firms.  Second,  the  incentive  to  litigate  cases  in order to continue to shield  conduct from the public as long as possible  frustrates  the process and  requires the expenditure of needless resources  by  both  litigants  and  the  PCAOB. In April, Chairman Doty, who  testified before the Subcommittee on  Securities, Insurance, and Investment,  noted that \u2018\u2018the fact that PCAOB disciplinary proceedings are required to  be secret creates a considerable incentive to litigate.\u2019\u2019  Third, a recent academic study noted  that the public nature of SEC\u2019s proceedings against companies result in  good results. \u2018\u2018Observing a public SEC  enforcement  action  in  its  industry  against a target firm is likely to increase a peer firm\u2019s knowledge about  SEC activity and cause it to revise upward its subjective probability of attracting such an action against itself.\u2019\u2019  In effect, the study noted that this  may serve as a deterrent to misconduct  because of a perceived increase in \u2018\u2018getting caught.\u2019\u2019 Accordingly, the audit  industry would also benefit from timely, public, and non-secret enforcement  proceedings.  Our bill will make hearings by the  PCAOB, and all related notices, orders,  and motions, open and available to the  public unless otherwise ordered by the  board. The board procedure would then  be similar to the SEC\u2019s Rules of Practice for similar matters, where hearings and related notices, orders, and  motions are open and available to the  public.  We need to ensure public proceedings  to better protect and serve companies  and  investors. I hope our colleagues  will join Senator GRASSLEYand me in  taking the legislative steps necessary  to  enhance  transparency  in  the  PCAOB\u2019s enforcement process.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 1907  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

By Mr. ENZI:  S. 1909. A bill to amend title 31,  United States Code, to provide for the  issuance of Buy Back America Bonds;  to the Committee on Finance.  Mr. ENZI. I rise today to introduce  my Buy Back America Bonds bill, S.  1909. This bill will not only help raise  awareness of our Nation\u2019s debt crisis,  but it will also give every American  the chance to be a part of the solution  to fix our country\u2019s fiscal dilemma. My  bill will allow Americans to invest in  this incredible country and bring foreign-held U.S. debt back to American  hands while at the same time reducing  Federal Government spending. But before  I talk about where my bill  is  going, I want to explain where I am  coming from.  In World War II, war bonds were sold  to help pay for our Nation\u2019s national  defense and reduce the amount of debt  incurred. People  from  all kinds  of  backgrounds saved toward purchasing  war bonds, often with nickels, dimes,  and quarters. On the job, people deducted the cost of war bonds from their  meager paychecks. Families  invested  in war bonds and saved for the future.  During World War II, President Roosevelt even asked the Boy Scouts of  America to sell war bonds, and they  did.  Boy  Scouts  and Girl  Scouts  worked with their packs and troops to  sell bonds to their neighbors and communities. In other words, all across the  country, folks of all walks and types  were working together for one collective goal\u2014to do their part for the country\u2019s war effort. Men, women, and children were selling and purchasing these  war bonds, all in the name of lending a  hand to our fellow countrymen and to  pay for the costs of war.  I was born during World War II. When  I was born, my parents bought me a  war bond. I still have that $20 bond  today. Not cashing it was my first gift  to my country, and it is also a keepsake to me.  In 1941, when savings bonds were retitled as \u2018\u2018war bonds\u2019\u2019 in the terrible  and devastating aftermath of Pearl  Harbor, the United States rallied as a  collective nation in support of the war  and war bond  effort. At  the  time,  though,  the average American only  earned about  $2,000 a year. Despite  these hardships and tough times, 134  million Americans were called on to be  part of the war bond effort, and more  than half of the U.S. population\u201485  million people\u2014responded to the patriotic call to participate.  The Scouts raised money and personally donated their own funds 10 cents  at a time in the form of stamps that  could be pasted into a war bond booklet. When war bond books were complete, they could be taken to the local  bank, and sometimes even the  local  post office, to purchase bonds. One innovative group even created a promotional cardboard with slots for 75  quarters that had to be filled before it  could be redeemed for a bond.  Showing his leadership and dedication to the effort, President Franklin  Delano Roosevelt purchased the very  first war bond issued. In part of President Roosevelt\u2019s April 30, 1941, radio  address  to  the American people, he  said:  One thought is uppermost in my mind as I  make grateful acknowledgment of this dual  honor. It is that in reserving the first Defense Savings Bond and the  first Defense  Postal Savings Stamps in the name of the  President, the Secretary of the Treasury and  the Postmaster General have given emphasis  to the national character of this defense savings campaign. This character of the campaign is national in the best sense of the  word, for it is going to reach down, we hope,  to the individual and the family in every  community and on every  farm,  in every  State and every possession of the United  States.  The President goes on to say:  It is national and it is homey at the same  time. For example, I am buying not one  stamp but ten stamps each to go into a little  book for each of my ten grandchildren. And  the first savings bond is being made out in  the name of Mrs. Roosevelt as beneficiary.  It is fitting that the President in his purchases should be a sort of a symbol of the determination of all the people to save and sacrifice in defense of democracy. In a larger  sense, this first defense bond and these first  defense stamps sold to the President constitute tangible evidence of a partnership\u2014a  partnership between all of the people and  their Government\u2014entered into to safeguard  and perpetuate all of those precious freedoms  which Government guarantees. In this time  of national peril, what we all must realize is  that the United States Government is you  and I and all other families next door all the  way across the country and back again. It is  one great partnership.  That ends the quote from President  Roosevelt.  The President concluded his address  by asking his fellow Americans to demonstrate their faith in America by investing in the new defense bonds and  stamps.

            "157": "November 18, 2011  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014Extensions of Remarks E2095  LIBERIA\u2019S PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTIONS  toward  perity.  social  stability and economic prosHON. JESSE L. JACKSON, JR.  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2011  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to congratulate Liberia on the completion of  its second peaceful and democratic  election. On November 15th, Liberia\u2019s National  Elections Commission certified President Ellen  Johnson Sirleaf of  the Unity Party as  the  President of the Republic of Liberia. The November 15 declaration followed a Presidential  run-off election on November 8, which was required by the Liberian Constitution as no candidate received a majority of votes in the first  round held on October 11.  I was encouraged by reports that the Liberian election process was deemed  free,  fair  and transparent by some 4,800 domestic and  international observers. The role that the African Union (AU), the Economic Community of  West African States, ECOWAS,  the Carter  Center and other institutions played was crucial  in providing additional confidence  in  the  process. I applaud the UN Mission in Liberia  for providing a safe and secure environment in  which voters were able  to cast  their ballots  without incident on both October 11 and November 8. Furthermore, I applaud the Liberian  people on demonstrating their commitment to  peace and democracy.  I congratulate President Johnson Sirleaf and  the newly elected members of  the National  Legislature, and I hope that they will work together to continue along the path to progress,  peace, and prosperity that Liberia has already  taken. At the same time, I express my deep  regret over the decision of the Congress for  Democratic Change, CDC, to boycott the runoff election based upon unproven allegations  that  the election process was  fraudulent.  I  concur  in  the  sentiments  expressed  by  ECOWAS, the AU and the Carter Center that  the CDC boycott deprived the people of Liberia of a dynamic vote in the runoff and created  a climate of intimidation and fear in the country.  I was saddened by the violent protest that  erupted on November 7, the eve of Liberia\u2019s  runoff election, and I mourn the lives lost on  that day, which will remain a shadow cast over  an otherwise peaceful and democratic process.  I\u2019m  pleased  by  President  Johnson  Sirleaf\u2019s efforts to set up an independent commission to investigate the incident and bring  those responsible  to  justice.  I  firmly believe  that  reconciliation  is essential  to  create a  sense of national unity and purpose, and I call  upon all political party leaders and their supporters to recognize the certified results of the  Presidential and Legislative contests.  The United States will hold accountable any  and all political  leaders and  their supporters  seeking to undermine Liberia\u2019s peace and democracy by all means available, including the  possible use of multilateral and bilateral sanctions.  It is now more important than ever that the  United States continue to work with Liberia\u2019s  elected leaders and stand by the Liberian people as  they move  to complete  their  journey  into post-conflict success, and sustain the path  f  TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF MR.  BENJAMIN HICKMANN WRIGHT SR.  HON. DONALD M. PAYNE  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2011  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor the memory of Mr. Benjamin Hickman  Wright, Senior who passed away on April 12,  2011. His beloved family is holding a memorial  service on November 23, 2011. Throughout  his lifetime, Mr. Wright exemplified the highest  traits of fidelity to his country and family in a  manner truly deserving of this great honor. Mr.  Wright was an individual who came from a lineage that strove for excellence in all facets of  their work. Over a lifetime of achievement and  service  to others, Mr. Wright embodied  the  ideals of hard work and dedication to his community, which is the bedrock of American values.  Mr. Wright was an individual who realized  significant achievements  throughout his  life.  This can be traced back to his family who attained advanced degrees in the early twentieth  century. In fact Mr. Wright\u2019s grandfather and  great uncle were  the  first African American  physicians in Ohio. Mr. Wright\u2019s father was a  top ranking life insurance salesman who also  gave back  to his  community by  teaching  sharecroppers how  to  read, write and calculate the price of their produce and goods.  After receiving a stellar education, Mr. Wright  served in the armed forces during World War  II in the European Theater as a First Class  Petty Officer of  the United States Navy. He  was recently honored for his service with an  Armed Forces Citation signed by President  Obama.  From one generation to the next, it is evident that the Wright family has attained significant accomplishments and  remained  committed to excellence in their work. Mr. Wright  maintained and advanced  this work  through  his many accomplishments including his service in the military followed by his service as an  Economic Advisor  in Monrovia, Liberia. Mr.  Wright would go on  to become a business  owner and an employee in several fortune 500  companies. By the 1980\u2019s he founded a nationwide coalition of civic and fraternal associations  that served  to empower and up  lift  others.  His commitment  to serving his community  and country and his accomplishments benefited and enhanced the lives of many citizens  over several decades. His memory and work  will be remembered by a grateful nation and I  am pleased  to add my voice as his  family  celebrates his legacy.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE CITY OF RIALTO\u2019S CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION  HON. JOE BACA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2011  Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask  Congress to join me in celebrating the City of  Rialto\u2019s 100th Birthday. Rialto has a long, rich  history, and has grown into a city that is home  to over 100,000 people. I have been fortunate  enough  to  raise my  family  in Rialto.  I am  proud to live in this city, represent these people, and join them in celebrating this momentous event.  Ancient artifacts and traces of a village indicate that Native Americans inhabited this area  between 1500 AD and 1800 AD. What happened to these people and settlements still remains a mystery. In 1769, the King of Spain  awarded areas of Rialto as  land grants  to  Spanish Dons. Following the cession of California to the United States, Mormons became  the  next  wave  of  settlers  in  the  San  Bernardino valley. By 1854 some of  these  early pioneers settled  in Rialto, constructing  ranches and farms in their wake. This period  gave birth  to  the  international distribution of  Muscat Grapes and the building of the oldest  structure in Rialto.  The Semi Tropic Land and Water Company  purchased 25,000 acres of land in 1887. The  company helped develop and  christen  the  town site. Hattie Merrill, daughter of the former  Governor of Iowa, Samuel Merrill, named the  town site after  the Rialto Bridge  in Venice,  Italy. Within  the same year, a railroad connector line was constructed in Rialto. Towns  were located every 2,600 yards along the line,  connecting  Rialto  to  towns  from  San  Bernardino to Pasadena. That year alone over  25 new  towns were built. During  the same  year, a group of Methodists settled in Rialto.  They originally came  to build a college, but  soon began to grow citrus in the beautiful climate of Rialto. Their farms quickly expanded  to acres of citrus groves. In 1888, the Brooke  School was built to educate the growing population. Many credit this group of Methodists for  developing the Town of Rialto.  By the late 1800s, Rialto became home to  a blacksmith, lumber yard, and a cement pipe  manufacturing company. The first citrus association was established, and  the  first citrus  packing house was built. Rialto\u2019s reputation for  beautiful homes with shaded drives began to  grow, and so did the population. In 1891, the  Rialto School District was formed, and in 1907  the Chamber of Commerce was established.  Over the next four years, the population grew  to the point that the town supported 40 businesses and a newspaper. In 1911, Rialto was  officially incorporated as a City.  For many years thereafter, the City of Rialto  continued  to grow, shipping citrus  to every  area in the country. Today those train tracks  still run through the City, but are used on a  much smaller scale\u2014the area has matured  and modernized. Throughout these changes,  Rialto remains a great place to raise a family.  My children grew up attending school and  playing sports  in  the area.  I am honored  to  have had the opportunity to serve this community both at the local and national level. My  son, Joe Baca, Jr. still lives in Rialto and has  the opportunity to serve our community as a  City Council Member. On behalf of my wife,  Barbara, and my children, Councilman Joe  Baca Jr., Jeremy, Natalie, and Jennifer, we  would like to join our neighbors in celebrating  Rialto\u2019s 100th birthday.

SCHILLING  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2011  Mr. SCHILLING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize National Adoption Day and to celebrate the many families who graciously open  their homes and their lives to the most vulnerable and often forgotten children in our communities. As the father of 10 children I understand the importance of family, I also understand  the many sacrifices parents make  to  provide  the best opportunities  for  their kids.  This is why I deeply respect adoptive and foster parents; they so readily take on additional  expenses and sacrifices  to provide a safe  home for a child.  I recently joined the Congressional Caucus  on Foster Care which  is dedicated  to protecting and promoting the welfare of the more  than 424,000 children who are part of the foster care system in the U.S. The Caucus provides a forum where Members can come together to discuss ways we can improve the  system and help these children make a successful transition out of care and into society.  Tomorrow, National Adoption Day will be  celebrated across the country. There are more  than 400 events planned to highlight the need  for more families to open their hearts to children in need and to show gratitude to those  who have  taken  that step.  I want  to  thank  each and every  foster parent and adoptive  parent for opening your safe and loving home  to a child. Thank you for taking the time to enrich the lives of those children who need it the  most.  f  ON THE OCCASION OF MARY LOUISE  PETERS-HUGHES\u2019  100th  BIRTHDAY  HON. GARY C. PETERS  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2011  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for  the most special purpose and privilege of honoring the life of Mary Louise Peters-Hughes on  the occasion of her 100th birthday.  Mary Louise Peters-Hughes  is a most remarkable woman, having  lived  through 100  years of the most changeable times in human  history; she is also my aunt, big sister to my  late father Herb, and the matriarch of our family.  Born on September 20, 1911, Mary came of  age amidst  the burgeoning era of women\u2019s  rights. Her achievements embodied the kind of  progress and  leadership envisioned by  that  movement; throughout her life, Mary has held  herself to a high standard of achievement and  leadership.  In 1929, she graduated valedictorian  from  Rochester High School, after serving  in  the  National Honor Society and as president of  her senior class. Mary matriculated  to Alma  College, during a  time when only 10% of  young people sought higher education. Mary  studied English and Latin and continued to be  a leader among her peers by serving as President of the Wright Ladies Hall and member of  the Philamathion Ladies Social Society. Within  four years, she graduated with a near-perfect  grade point average. Finally, before embarking  upon a career in teaching, Aunt Mary obtained  her Master\u2019s Degree  from  the University of  Michigan.  Aunt Mary was a devoted teacher, always  encouraging her students  to  fulfill  their best  potentials. She did the same with family, too.  Ever the supportive big sister, she sent my father money every week as he worked to get  his own degree  from her alma mater, Alma  College. My  father often  talked of his deep  gratitude  for her vital support of him during  those  lean depression. After marrying my  uncle, Halley Hughes, Mary took a leave from  her career and devoted herself  full  time  to  family and raising her three sons: Bob, Dick,  and Jim.  Later in life, Aunt Mary returned to her beloved career and for another 21 years. And as  a passionate educator, Aunt Mary joined both  the National Education Association and Delta  Kappa Gamma  to enhance  the status and  fight  for  the  rights of her  fellow  teachers  across Michigan and the Nation.  Mr. Speaker,  though she  is my beloved  aunt, by any objective measure Mary Louise  Peters-Hughes has  lived an exceptional  life,  marked by academic excellence, an admirable  professional career and a most compassionate  and strong family life. Her story and path is  truly one we can all look to as an example for  our own  lives.  I, my wife and children and  Mary\u2019s  three children, six grandchildren and  nine great grandchildren are grateful  for  the  100 years she has lived and the lessons and  love she has shared with each of us. We wish  for many more lived in health and happiness.  f  CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2112,  CONSOLIDATED  AND  FURTHER  CONTINUING  APPROPRIATIONS  ACT, 2012  SPEECHOF  HON. RUSH D. HOLT  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 17, 2011  Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Fiscal Year 2012 Conference report  for  the  Agriculture,  Commerce-Justice-  Science, and Transportation-HUD appropriations bill.  However, I regret the process that brought  this bill to the floor. A full one third of this bill,  the Transportation-HUD appropriations, has  never been considered by the House before.  This bill was not written in an open process  and members were  not  allowed  to  offer  amendments to improve the bill.  I am pleased that this bill included the funding I fought for to help our local residents recover and  rebuild  from  the  flooding which  caused so much destruction  in New Jersey.  This bill provides $2.3 billion in needed disaster assistance to ensure Central New Jersey\u2019s businesses and home owners have the  resources they need to mitigate the damage  and put in place preventive measures in advance of future disasters.  Further,  this bill rejects  the dangerous attempt by House Republicans to end the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) and  provides the program with almost $200 million  to help  local police departments keep our  communities safe despite  the  local budget  constraints. While this represents a steep cut  in funding from last year, these funds will help  some  local departments who are having  to  make tough decisions about firing police officers for a lack of resources. Going forward,  we must do far more to get more cops back  on the beat.  In these difficult times, this bill also denies  an attempt to reduce funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)  and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC).  SNAP and WIC help our  fellow Americans  during their most difficult times with some food  assistance to help make ends meet. As millions of our fellow Americans are struggling in  this difficult economy, this bill provides $105  billion for domestic food assistance programs,  an 18 percent  increase  from  last year,  to  make sure they are at least able to keep some  food on the table.  As a research scientist,  I have  long supported the important role of federal investment  in basic research. I am glad this bill increases  funding  for  the National Science Foundation  (NSF) to $7 billion, an increase of $173 million. It also provides the necessary funding to  continue the development of the James Webb  Space Telescope that will allow researchers to  find  the  first galaxies and help create  jobs  now. Further, this bill provides the U.S. Patent  and Trademark Office a 29 percent increase in  funding to ensure that our Nation\u2019s inventors  are able to get their ideas to market and help  grow our economy.  I am also pleased that this bill makes needed changes to ensure that the maximum loan  limits for the Federal Housing Administration  are maintained at a level necessary for areas  with high cost housing like we have in New  Jersey. With  the housing market still weak,  this will help provide some necessary stability  and support for prospective home owners.  It is unfortunate that this bill freezes funding  for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission which is tasked with implementing many  of the commonsense Wall Street reforms we  approved last year. Without additional funding  the CFTC will struggle to prevent future financial crises, and not have the resources needed to fight oil speculation which is increasing  the cost of gas at the pump.  Finally, I regret that this bill contains a number of funding restrictions that will limit our Nation\u2019s law enforcement officers from combating  gun  trafficking and prevent sensible  regulations from being established to prevent guns  from  falling  into  the hands of criminals. Yet  again  the NRA has been given an early  Christmas present with the inclusion of these  special giveaways tucked into this bill without  a vote or any debate on them.  This is not a perfect bill but it prevents a  looming government shutdown. Further, it provides funding increases for a number of critical  programs and rejects many of the dangerous  cuts contained  in  the  funding bills  that  the  House previously approved. I support passage  of this bill despite its pessimistic view of what  America can achieve through ambitious funding of the programs covered under the bill.

We have lost more wealth  from mortgages  being  under water  than from any other financial kinds of  transactions. And if we had had a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in  place when this calamity was taking  place, we wouldn\u2019t be in the financial  mess that we are in today.  f  HONORING MARTINA CORREIA  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON) for 5 minutes.  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam  Speaker, today I rise to honor Martina  Correia, who  passed  away  recently  from breast cancer. Martina was a courageous  and  inspiring woman who  proved what President Obama  has  often said, \u2018\u2018In the face of impossible  odds, people who love this country can  change  it.\u2019\u2019  For  decades, Martina  fought for human rights in defense of  her brother, who was  sentenced  to  death based on unreliable eyewitness  testimony  that was  later  recanted.  Martina\u2019s  brother,  Troy  Anthony  Davis, was on death row for 20 years  until his execution this year.  Thanks  to Martina, people  rallied  around Troy\u2019s case and began to really  think about how it is that a society  such as ours can execute a potentially  innocent man. Inspired by Martina, a  diverse array of men and women in the  United States and  from around  the  world,  people  like Amnesty  International\u2019s Laura Moye; NAACP President Ben Jealous; Reverend Raphael  Warnock, pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church where the reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once  pastored; British MP Alistair Carmichael; former President Jimmy Carter; Pope Benedict XVIth; and a large  group of other distinguished  leaders  from around the world whose names  are too numerous for me to recognize  at this time. These folks banded together  to  fight  for Troy Anthony  Davis\u2019 life.  From her humble roots in Georgia,  Martina  led  this  international campaign to save her brother and prove his  innocence. Martina advocated for justice and fought to save her brother\u2019s  life. And  in so doing, she became a  death penalty abolitionist in the movement to move America to renounce and  abolish the death penalty, whereupon  America could finally join the ranks of  the other industrialized nations of the  world that have barred the use of this  barbaric form of punishment.  She became an international human  rights advocate, and it will, in part, be  due to her efforts that we will one day  cheer the abolition of the death penalty in this country. I will remember  and thank Martina when we reach that  milestone in our development as a Nation and as a people.  Martina  fought this battle  for her  brother while fighting her own battle  with breast cancer. You see, she was diagnosed with breast cancer 11 years  ago, and at that time, she was given 6  months to live. She beat the odds and  fought to stay alive so that she could  fight for her brother. Before her diagnosis, Martina was a nurse, and she was  also a veteran who served her country  in the 1992 Gulf war.  Martina\u2019s  illness eventually  forced  her to stop working for a living, but  she continued to advocate for what was  important to her. In addition to her  work on behalf of her brother, Martina  also was a leader of the National Black  Leadership Initiative on Cancer, where  she advocated for a cure. Her mother,  Virginia Davis, died in April 2011 shortly after her son, Troy Anthony Davis,  suffered defeat on his appeal. Martina  is survived by one son, Antone De\u2019Juan  Davis-Correia;  two  sisters, Kimberly  and Ebony Davis; and one brother, Lester Davis.  It was an honor  for me to know  Martina and an honor for me to meet  her mother and an honor for me to  meet her brother.  I\u2019m comforted  in  knowing that she will reunite with her  dear mother and with her brother,  Troy, as their lives are linked for all  eternity.  Strong and fearless, fighting to the  very end without giving up or giving  in, she fought a great fight. And now  it\u2019s  time  to  rest  for  a  little  bit,  Martina. You rest in peace. But rest  knowing that the movement to abolish  the death penalty will continue, and  with your example at the top of our  minds, we will never give up until the  job is done.  f  b1050  TAKING ON CURRENCY  MANIPULATORS  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. DONNELLY) for 5 minutes.  Mr. DONNELLY of Indiana. Madam  Speaker, I rise today because it has  been weeks since the bipartisan majority in the Senate passed legislation to  take on currency manipulators. Weeks  have passed, and House leadership has  refused to allow a stand-alone up-or-  down vote on currency manipulation  legislation right here in the House of  Representatives. Legislators from both  sides of the aisle talk about the importance of creating jobs every day. Why  wouldn\u2019t we take this opportunity to  work together to not only create jobs  but to also protect the good-paying  jobs we already have here in America?  Recently, the Peterson Institute for  International  Economics  concluded  that China\u2019s currency is undervalued  by 24 percent against the dollar. That  means that America\u2019s manufacturers  are competing with Chinese manufacturers who are enjoying a permanent 24  percent off sale. Isn\u2019t it time to do  something about these problems, problems that are damaging the U.S. economy, and to stand up  for American  manufacturers?  When countries are allowed to keep  the values of their currencies artificially low and, in turn, the price of  their exports into the United States,  American companies face an unfair disadvantage. American  companies  are  currently playing on an unlevel playing field where their competitors are  able to maintain a permanent sale on  all the products they sell. As our trade  deficit  increases with countries  like  China, we lose American jobs. In fact,  the Economic Policy Institute released  a study this fall showing that, between  2001 and 2010, the U.S. lost 2.8 million  jobs, including nearly 62,000 jobs in my  own State of Indiana, as a result of the  expanding trade deficit with China.  The Senate has already acted on this  issue. It passed the Currency Exchange  Rate Oversight Reform Act in October.  The passage of this bill assures that  correcting unfair trade practices is not  a Democrat or a Republican  issue\u2014  rather, it\u2019s an American priority. Sixteen Republican Senators  joined  47  Democrat Senators in voting for this  bill to counter the currency manipulation that is damaging our economic recovery. In a time of too much partisan  bickering, we need to take the opportunity to work together and stand up  for American businesses and American  workers. That\u2019s what we were sent here  to do.  In addition to the Senate-passed bill,  we have a piece of legislation, which is  waiting for a vote right here in the  House, with 225 cosponsors of both Republicans and Democrats. That\u2019s more  than a majority. The Currency Reform  for Fair Trade Act would allow the Department of Commerce to counter imports, made cheaper by currency manipulation, with a corresponding tariff.  A  nearly  identical  bill  passed  the  House  last year with 348 votes. The  support is here. We just need to take  this vote.  When I travel around north central  Indiana, I often hear from small businesses and manufacturers on this issue,  and they never ask that Congress guarantee their success. They simply ask  for a level playing field and to have the  rules the same for everybody. All they  want is a fair fight.  So, today, I echo my request from 2  months ago to the House leadership: It  is time. It is time for bipartisan legislation that addresses currency manipulation and to have a vote on it here in  the House of Representatives\u2014a stand-  alone up-or-down vote.  As I said then and as I\u2019ll say again to  our House  leadership: Who  do you  stand with, the Chinese Government or  the American workers? It is time to  stand up for our country\u2014for all of the  people who work in our country and for  all of our citizens. Let\u2019s have a vote.  f  SMART SECURITY: A BETTER  INVESTMENT THAN  10 YEARS OF  WAR IN AFGHANISTAN  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore.

            "14": "H8150  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE December 6, 2011  for  the American people  something  today.  Mr. NUGENT. I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from  Connecticut  (Ms.  DELAURO).  Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, while  this body wastes its time debating yet  another bill that does nothing to create jobs or help the middle class, the  American people are looking for action  from us. We need to stop supporting  handouts for wealthy corporations and  pass an extension of the payroll tax  and  unemployment  benefits  immediately.  Despite  saying  for months,  if not  years, that tax cuts are their most important  priority,  the majority  has  failed to act on a critical extension of  the payroll tax, even though it would  save  the  average American  family  $1,500 a year; 400,000 jobs will be lost if  we do not pass this payroll tax extension.  The majority has also failed to act on  extending  unemployment  insurance  benefits,  even  though UI has kept  900,000 kids out of poverty last year. In  fact, the number of Americans in poverty would have doubled last year if  the unemployment insurance benefits  had not been extended. And at least  200,000 jobs will be lost if the majority  blocks an extension of benefits.  But instead of acting on these two  important priorities, what does the Republican majority spend its time on?  We have seen them protect wasteful  tax breaks for corporate jet and race  horse owners, corporate subsidies for  Big Agriculture, Big Oil, special tax  treatment for Wall Street millionaires  and billionaires, and now  this misguided bill, which would undermine our  regulatory system to the detriment of  everything  from  food safety to protecting the environment without doing  anything to create jobs.  Time and again, the majority has  shown that they will go to any lengths  to side with the wealthiest 1 percent of  Americans, while turning their backs  on middle class and working families.  To take one more example, this past  week Democrats introduced a payroll  tax cut for 160 million people, offset by  raising taxes on 350,000 millionaires.  But the Republican majority instead  put forward a package that would slash  the Federal workforce, raise Medicare  premiums,  curtail  the  social  safety  nets.  Instead  of  just  having America\u2019s  wealthiest families pay their fair share  of taxes, the majority would rather see  more lost public jobs and less support  for middle class families, all in order to  continue a tax cut that independent  economists agree  is critical  for our  economy.  Keep in mind the Republican mantra  in recent memory has always been that  tax cuts never, never need to be offset.  And a year ago they said the same of a  payroll tax cut. They\u2019ve now changed  their tune.  American  families  deserve  better  leadership than this. Right now, Congress should be doing everything in its  power  to  create  jobs,  rebuild  our  schools and infrastructure, support our  small  businesses,  get  our  economy  moving again. That means passing an  extension and expansion of the payroll  tax cut; that means passing an extension of the unemployment  insurance  benefits.  Working to create  jobs, that\u2019s our  job. We do not have the  luxury to  waste America\u2019s time catering to the  wealthiest interests in our society and  considering ill-conceived bills such as  this one.  Mr. NUGENT. I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from  Illinois  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY).  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.  I am really confused. I know that  many  of my Republican  colleagues  have signed a pledge that said that  never will they raise taxes on anybody,  the Grover Norquist pledge. I think it\u2019s  a silly idea to sign such a thing, but  most have done that.  Yet it does seem that when it comes  to middle class tax cuts, there\u2019s this  little hesitation going on. Do we really  mean  cutting  taxes  for  the middle  class? Do we mean preserving tax cuts  for the middle class? Or are we just  talking about the wealthiest Americans?  Right now, if we don\u2019t move ahead  with extending the payroll tax cut,  that\u2019s what most, that\u2019s what all working families pay, their payroll taxes.  You know, we hear, oh, the wealthy,  that the wealthy are paying all the income taxes. Yeah, most people would  like to pay  income taxes. But they  definitely pay payroll taxes if they\u2019re  working. And they\u2019re risking 160 million Americans who would not get tax  relief if we don\u2019t extend the payroll tax  cut for working families.  So we need to do that before we  leave. But, instead, we\u2019re talking about  some way to stop any kind of regulations, further health and safety regulations, making it hard to do that.  I got a letter from someone talking  about  the  unemployment  insurance  and extending those benefits. He says,  this is from John, in my district: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m  a Desert Storm Veteran and lost my  job October 21, 2010. I\u2019ve been drawing  unemployment and am now on  extended unemployment benefits. I, like  millions of Americans, would rather be  working 80 hours a week if possible.  The job market is scary, but what\u2019s  worse is the thought that we might be  without that last bit of a safety net  come the end of December.\u2019\u2019  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  time of the gentlewoman has expired.  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I would be happy  to yield my colleague an additional  minute.  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. John continued:  \u2018\u2018These benefits for many is the difference between having a  roof over  your head and living on the streets.\u2019\u2019  He says: \u2018\u2018I just hope you can encourage your fellow House Members to put  the livelihood of millions of Americans  above their petty politics.\u2019\u2019  Above the petty politics. That\u2019s what  we\u2019re facing right now. If we extend unemployment  insurance  benefits,  it\u2019s  not just good for John and his family;  it\u2019s not just good for the hundreds of  thousands of people that would  lose  their  unemployment  benefits  over  500,000 in January. It is also good for  the economy. Every dollar generates a  $1.52 in economic activity in the country.  These are the things that the American people at this holiday season are  worrying about, are afraid of. He calls  it scary. He\u2019s afraid. And we\u2019re dealing  with this pettiness right now. Let\u2019s get  over it and on with the business of the  people.  Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to my fellow Rules member,  the gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP).  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I thank you for  the time.  Mr. Speaker, I will apologize in advance  for actually  talking on  topic  here.  In 1791, the Second Session of Congress, John Page was a Congressman  from Virginia, and he objected to his  peers who wanted to leave and let the  designation of postal routes be left to  the President. They trusted the President, justifiably, but John Page threatened his colleagues by saying that if we  do so he will move to adjourn and leave  all the objects of  legislation to the  President\u2019s sole consideration and direction.  b1310  Now, the issue at hand back in 1791  was not necessarily what roads and  routes should be taken, even though  they did have an economic impact. The  issue was who should designate those  routes because every rule and regulation  is, by definition, a  legislative  function. It is not a function of the administration that should be given to  the President or the bureaucracies that  are created because of it. It is a congressional function. But we do not take  the time to make the details in our  particular piece of  legislation. When  we simply ask in our legislation that a  Secretary in a department shall have  the power to write rules and regulations and then leave it at that, we are  abrogating our responsibility.  \u2018\u2018Country of origin\u2019\u2019 labeling sounded  like a great idea. We should know if we  are buying American beef. Even though  it was passed before I became a Member of Congress, it was my eighth year  in Congress before they were able to  write the rules because Congress did  not take the time and effort to go  through the details of understanding  what we were doing when we are passing legislation.

            "22": "H8158  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE December 6, 2011  It\u2019s been more than 10 years since 9/  11 and the anthrax attacks that followed. And while we haven\u2019t had a successful terrorist attack on U.S. soil,  our enemies are still working every  day to kill innocent Americans. Today  the  threat  of  bioterrorism  remains  very real.  Earlier this year, the bipartisan Graham-Talent Commission warned that  the United States it is still \u2018\u2018vulnerable  to a large-scale biological attack.\u2019\u2019  Thankfully, we have spent the last  decade preparing for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats  by developing and stockpiling numerous medical countermeasures to protect American citizens in case of such  an attack. Because of these efforts, we  now have numerous vaccines and treatments in the Strategic National Stockpile that will save lives, and thousands  of lives, in the event of such an attack.  But we have more work to do to be  prepared. H.R. 2405 is a bipartisan, fiscally responsible bill that will reauthorize successful biodefense programs  at  the Department  of Health  and  Human Services while also making  some key changes to our Nation\u2019s biodefense strategy.  In 2004 Congress passed Project BioShield, which created a market guarantee that prompted the private sector  to develop  countermeasures  for  the  Federal Government. Because the government is the only purchaser of these  countermeasures, it was important to  show the private sector we were committed to developing and eventually  purchasing these products  for stockpile.  Project BioShield Special Reserve  Fund has been a critical tool to protect  our country against an attack, and this  legislation will reauthorize the fund for  5 additional years to continue the Federal Government\u2019s commitment to procurement of medical countermeasures.  Importantly, this legislation reaffirms  that the Special Reserve Fund should  only be used for chemical, biological,  radiological,  and  nuclear  countermeasure procurement. This  is a national  security  priority,  and  these  funds  should never be diverted  for  other purposes.  In  2006, Congress  created  a Biomedical Advanced Research and Development  Authority,  called  BARDA,  which helped bridge what many termed  the  \u2018\u2018valley of death\u2019\u2019 that had prevented many  countermeasure  developers  from being successful. BARDA  was created because we recognize that  most of the CBRN countermeasures do  not yet exist and medical development  countermeasure is a risky, expensive  and lengthy process.  BARDA bridges the funding gap between early-stage research and the ultimate procurement of products from  the SRF fund from the national stockpile. H.R. 2405 reauthorizes BARDA for  5 years.  In 2006, we also created a unique set  of public health programs to assist hospitals, local public health departments,  and first responders in their preparedness efforts. Under H.R. 2405, these programs have been reauthorized for an  additional 5 years so that we can continue to strengthen our preparedness  infrastructure so critical  for prevention and dealing with any possible attack.  H.R. 2405 also strengthens the role of  the HHS Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response. We need to  have one leader at HHS that coordinates countermeasure development and  stockpiling across all agencies. This  bill does that.  Finally, this bill includes important  reforms to the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA. The bill strengthens  FDA\u2019s role in reviewing medical products for national security priorities.  I believe that we\u2019ve identified biological threats and spent millions in  taxpayers\u2019  funds to develop countermeasures. The FDA must take a lead  role in getting these countermeasures  approved.  While we can use many of these products without FDA approval through an  emergency-use authorization, the FDA  licensure  is  hugely  important  and  sends an  important signal to developers of these new hopeful technologies  and immunizations working on next-  generation medical countermeasures.  Simply  put,  medical  countermeasures for national security priorities cannot continue to be treated the  same way  as  the  next Viagra  or  Lipitor. FDA must accelerate their review and approval.  It\u2019s important for Members to know  that this legislation, again, is fiscally  responsible. H.R. 2405 does not create  any new Federal programs or increase  spending in any existing programs. I  am pleased CBO has confirmed this in  their score. H.R. 2405 creates a 5-year  reauthorization of the biodefense programs we know are working while  making critical policy changes at HHS  to strengthen countermeasure development and public health preparedness.  I would like to thank my colleagues  on the Energy and Commerce Committee for their hard work on this bipartisan  legislation. Mr. UPTON, Mr.  PITTS, Mr. WAXMAN, Mr. PALLONE, and  their staffs have spent several months  helping us develop a bipartisan bill  that can be signed into law. I want to  especially  thank my  friends, GENE  GREEN, SUEMYRICK, and ANNAESHOO  for their work to advance this legislation; and I appreciate your work and  counsel along the way, Mr. GREEN.  I hope we never have to use these  countermeasures, Mr.  Speaker;  but  they are critical to the assurance that  the public will be protected from an attack, and we must continue to speed  development and strengthen our national stockpile. Simply put, we must  always be prepared.  I would urge the strong support of  H.R. 2405.  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield  such time as he may consume to one of  the authors of the bill, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN).  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, as a personal aside, this probably won\u2019t be the headline on the 6  o\u2019clock news tonight around the country because we\u2019re actually agreeing on  something, and I think I can associate  myself with the remarks of my colleague, the primary sponsor of this bill,  as well as he could associate with  mine, Mr. PALLONE, and Mr. PITTS.  But I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 2405, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act  of 2011, which will reauthorize certain  provisions of the Project BioShield Act  of 2004 and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006, and I\u2019m  proud to be an original cosponsor of  this legislation.  This legislation was initially passed  by Congress to help the U.S. develop  medical  countermeasures  against  chemical, biological, radiological, and  nuclear terrorism agents to provide a  mechanism for Federal acquisition of  these  newly  developed  countermeasures.  Our Nation  remains vulnerable  to  these threats because many of the vaccines and medicines that are needed to  protect our citizens do not exist. Developing and stockpiling these medical  countermeasures  require  time,  resources and research, all of which will  be provided under this legislation before us today.  As my colleague from Michigan said,  it may not be the bestseller on the  market, like so many other pharmaceuticals, but this is something that  our country needs.  H.R. 2405 is important to me because  the  University  of  Texas  Medical  Branch-Galveston National Laboratory  is literally in the backyard of our congressional district. The Galveston National Lab is the only BSL\u20134 lab located on a university campus.  At the lab, the scientists conduct research and develop therapies, vaccines,  and diagnostic tests for naturally-occurring  emerging  diseases  such  as  SARS and avian influenza, as well as  for microbes that may be employed by  terrorists.  This is exactly the type of research  we hope to encourage under the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness  Reauthorization Act. As an original cosponsor of H.R. 2405 with Mr. ROGERS,  I\u2019m really pleased with how quickly we  moved this rare bipartisan piece of legislation. I want to thank Mr. ROGERS,  Chairman UPTON, Ranking Member  and Ranking Member PALLONE, along with  the  chair of our  Health Subcommittee, Mr. PITTS, Mrs.  MYRICK, Ms. ESHOO, and Mr. MARKEY  for their work on H.R. 2405.

One of the results of a slack economy  is that more individuals and businesses  have filed for bankruptcy. In fact, over  the past 3 years, the number of bankruptcy petitions  filed  in bankruptcy  courts has doubled. While recent data  show that the volume of cases is beginning to subside, our bankruptcy judges  remain hard at work.  Bankruptcy judges are critical to the  operation of our Federal bankruptcy  courts. The important bankruptcy reforms Congress passed in 2005, for example, called on judges to do more to  help prevent bankruptcy abuse; and  large, complex chapter 11 cases, like  the recently filed mega-case of American Airline, are time intensive for our  bankruptcy judges.  In the last Congress, the Judiciary  Committee  reported  a  bankruptcy  judgeships bill that would have created  new permanent judgeships, converted  temporary  judgeships  to  permanent  status, and extended temporary judgeships. The House passed that bill, but  it did not pass the Senate.  As a result, several temporary judgeships are in danger of being unable to  be refilled if there is a vacancy. But  the need  for bankruptcy  judges  remains high.  I  introduced  the  legislation under  consideration with the ranking member of the Courts, Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee of the  Judiciary Committee, STEVE the chairman of that subcommittee,  HOWARDCOBLE, and the ranking member of the full Judiciary Committee,  COHEN,  JOHNCONYERS.  This bill permits 23 temporary bankruptcy judgeships in judicial districts  throughout the country to be filled if  there is a judgeship vacancy in those  districts during the next 5 years as a  result of a judge\u2019s death, removal, retirement, or resignation.  Congress  should  ensure  there  are  enough bankruptcy  judges to handle  the increased caseloads as a result of  the recession; but Congress should also  conserve Federal resources and conduct  periodic oversight of judicial caseloads.  H.R. 1021 authorizes a 5-year extension,  which preserves Congress\u2019s ability to  reassess  the  need  for  bankruptcy  judges in a few years.  Time is of the essence. I urge the  Senate also  to act quickly on  this  measure so that our bankruptcy system may  continue  to operate with  speed and efficiency.  I want to thank the bill\u2019s cosponsors  for their bipartisan support.  One of the results of the slack economy is  that more  individuals and businesses have  filed  for bankruptcy.  In  fact, over  the past  three years,  the number of bankruptcy petitions filed in bankruptcy courts has doubled.  While  recent data show  that  the volume of  cases is beginning to subside, our bankruptcy  judges remain hard at work.  Bankruptcy judges are critical to the operation of our federal bankruptcy courts. The imCOHEN;  portant bankruptcy reforms Congress passed  in 2005, for example, called on judges to do  more to help prevent bankruptcy abuse. And  large, complex chapter 11 cases, like the recently  filed mega-case of American Airlines,  are time-intensive for our bankruptcy judges.  However, no new bankruptcy  judgeships  have been created since 2005. At that time,  Congress created  temporary  judgeships so  that it could periodically review the caseloads  in each district and assess whether the temporary judgeship was still needed. Permanent  judgeships have not been authorized since  1992.  Every two years, the Judicial Conference of  the United States publishes a report to Congress that details the judicial needs of each  district. The Conference evaluates need based  on a \u2018\u2018weighted caseload\u2019\u2019 analysis. The 2011  weighted caseload statistics demonstrate that  judges are desperately needed in many districts.  In  the  last Congress,  the Judiciary Committee  reported a bankruptcy  judgeships bill  that would  have  created  new  permanent  judgeships, converted temporary judgeships to  permanent  status and extended  temporary  judgeships. The House passed that bill but it  did not pass the Senate.  As a result, several  temporary  judgeships  are in danger of being unable to be refilled if  there  is a vacancy. But  the need  for bankruptcy judges remains high.  I introduced the legislation under consideration with the Ranking Member of the Courts,  Commercial  and Administrative  Law Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, STEVE  the Chairman of  that subcommittee,  HOWARDCOBLE; and the Ranking Member of  the full Judiciary Committee, JOHNCONYERS.  This bill permits 23  temporary bankruptcy  judgeships  in  judicial districts  throughout  the  country to be filled if there is a judgeship vacancy  in  those districts during  the next  five  years as a result of a judge\u2019s death, removal,  retirement or resignation.  Congress should ensure there are enough  bankruptcy  judges  to handle  the  increased  caseloads as a result of  the recession. But  Congress should also conserve  federal  resources and conduct periodic oversight of judicial caseloads. H.R. 1021 authorizes a 5-year  extension, which preserves Congress\u2019s ability  to reassess the need for bankruptcy judges in  a few years.  The relief a debtor receives from the bankruptcy system is extraordinary; they either reorganize their debts on more favorable terms  or they get a complete discharge of all their  prepetition debts. All except  the poorest of  debtors pay a fee to file a bankruptcy case  and receive these benefits.  I believe it is fair to use debtors\u2019 filing fees  to pay for the costs associated with our bankruptcy  judges. This  legislation, as amended,  raises the filing fee on chapter 11 reorganization cases from $1000 to $1042\u2014a modest 4  percent increase. As a result, this bill does not  increase direct spending by the federal government.  Time is of the essence. I urge the Senate  also to act quickly on this measure so that our  bankruptcy system may continue  to operate  with speed and efficiency.  I thank the bill\u2019s cosponsors for their bipartisan support.  HOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES,  COMMITTEEONWAYSANDMEANS,  Washington, DC, December 5, 2011.  Hon.

As you know, the Committee on Ways and  Means maintains jurisdiction over revenue  measures generally. H.R. 1021, as amended,  contains a provision that raises revenue by  increasing the Chapter 11 filing fees for the  operation and maintenance of the courts of  the United States, which falls within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and  Means.  In order to expedite this bill  for  Floor  consideration,  the Committee will  forgo action on the bill. This is being done  with the understanding that it does not in  any way prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or its  jurisdictional prerogatives on this or similar  legislation in the future.  I would appreciate your response to this  letter, confirming this understanding with  respect to H.R. 1021, as amended, and would  ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on  this matter be included in the Congressional  Record during Floor consideration.

I am most appreciative of your decision to  forego consideration of H.R. 1021, as amended, so that it may move expeditiously to the  House  floor. I acknowledge that although  you are waiving formal consideration of the  bill, the Committee on Ways and Means is in  no way waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in the bill. In addition,  if a conference is necessary on this legislation, I will support any request that Ways  and Means be represented therein.  Finally, I shall be pleased to include this  letter and your letter of the same date in the  Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 1021.  Sincerely,  LAMARSMITH,  Chairman.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate the excellent description  of the chairman, LAMARSMITH, on H.R.  1021,  the  Temporary  Bankruptcy  Judgeships Extension Act. This  is a  very bipartisan piece of legislation, extending by 5 years the authorizations  for 30 temporary bankruptcy judges in  more than 20 judicial districts around  the country.  I might point out that we\u2019re not adding bankruptcy judges; and, Members  of the House, that\u2019s what we ought to  be doing, really, instead of just continuing  the  same number.

            "38": "H8174  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE December 6, 2011  TON Wendy Hoffman, the national president of the Blue Star Mothers, has sent  a letter to the committee and requests  that their charter be amended consistent with the resolution passed at  their national convention. She stated  the following:  \u2018\u2018As mothers of American  servicemembers and veterans, we recognize  changing  family dynamics and have  found  it extremely  important to  include other \u2018mothers\u2019 who have played  a part in raising military heroes and  also those mothers who are not residents of the U.S.\u2019\u2019  The Blue Star Mothers have also  opened membership to mothers of children who have served in the military at  any time. This bill makes the changes  to the charter requested by the Blue  Star Mothers. Our colleague SCOTTTIPintroduced the House version of  the bill, H.R. 2815, and the Judiciary  Committee approved Mr. TIPTON\u2019s bill  by voice vote.  This commonsense bill opens eligibility to \u2018\u2018a woman who filled the role  of birth mother, adoptive mother, stepmother,  foster-mother,  grandmother,  or legal guardian\u2019\u2019 to a current member  of the Armed Forces or to a child who  has served at any time. To be eligible,  the mother will not have to reside in  the United States as long as she is a  U.S. citizen.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill to help enable the Blue Star Mothers to continue their wonderful work.  With that, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  S. 1541, the Senate version of H.R.  2815, is another bipartisan bill to revise  the Federal charter of the Blue Star  Mothers of America. The revisions implemented  by  the  legislation  once  again reflect minor changes recently  made to the organization\u2019s membership  eligibility requirements.  The Blue Star Mothers of America,  representing the mothers of military  servicemen and  -women, has been a  federally chartered organization since  1960. The  existing  charter  restricts  member in three ways:  A, members must be birth mothers,  adoptive mothers,  or  certain  stepmothers;  B, members must be U.S. citizens  currently living in the country; and  C, the corresponding serviceman or  -woman must be currently serving in  the Armed Forces or must have served  in World War II or the Korean War.  Last year, at the organization\u2019s national convention, the group adopted a  resolution expanding these eligibility  criteria. A conforming amendment to  the Federal charter is needed in order  make these changes operable.  S. 1541, the Senate bill, was introduced by Senator MICHAELBENNETof  Colorado. Its House companion was introduced by Representative SCOTTTIPTON, also of Colorado.  The  legislation makes three minor  revisions to the organization\u2019s charter:  First, to expand the membership eligibility requirements to include foster  mothers, grandmothers,  female  legal  guardians, and all stepmothers;  Second,  it expands membership to  U.S. citizens living abroad;  Third, it expands eligibility to servicemen and -women who served in prior  conflicts other than World War II and  the Korean War.  Our men and women in the military  need all the support we can offer, so I  applaud this effort by the Blue Star  Mothers to provide the circle of support that the organization can provide.  They  do much  to  remember  our  servicepeople, and I appreciate their efforts. I support these changes, and I  urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, this  is also another very bipartisan bill.  The Blue Star Mothers is a wonderful  group. I have met with them and I have  wept with them. I\u2019ve prayed for them  and am grateful  to  them  for  their  work. I\u2019m grateful for my mother, who  passed away in 1991, as the mother of a  servicemember and my stepmother as  well, now.  What they\u2019re asking for makes perfect sense, and I would encourage my  colleagues to support this resolution as  the Blue Star Mothers have requested.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore. The  question is on the motion offered by  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, S. 1541.  The question was taken; and (two-  thirds being  in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was  passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on  the table.  f  SAVE THE POST OFFICE  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker,  the  other day the Postmaster General said  that first class mail wasn\u2019t going to be  first class anymore; it wasn\u2019t going to  be overnight; it might be 2 or 3 days.  Because of  the problems we have  with making the post office financially  sufficient, there are ways they could  accomplish this, and I\u2019ve got a bill that  allows them to go into other services  to  expand  their  revenue  base,  and  there\u2019s also about $5 billion that\u2019s an  issue  concerning  payments  into  a  health fund that could be resolved.  The post office is almost as American  as apple pie. A lot of people will switch  to using the Internet to pay their bills  and they\u2019ll never go back to the post  office. I\u2019m afraid that what\u2019s been recommended  is penny-wise and pound-  foolish, and a great American institution that serves many rural people and  others without a lot of connectivity  and fortune will suffer.  I wish the Postmaster General will  reconsider his action. I have a \u2018\u2018Dear  Colleague\u2019\u2019 being  circulated.  I hope  people will sign on and that we will  save the U.S. Postal Service.  f  AMERICA AT A CROSSROADS  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under  the Speaker\u2019s announced policy of January 5, 2011, the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority  leader.  Mr. GOHMERT. Madam  Speaker,  there are an awful lot of people hurting  across America now.  We take up a few suspension bills  here that only the Congress could deal  with, so it\u2019s something we have to do,  we\u2019re proud to do, important to those  organizations in two States. It\u2019s important to them; it\u2019s important to us.  We have people on the other side of  the aisle who come forward and try to  make  it  into a  jobs debate when  it  would seem that some of the best debate would be if all of us, en masse,  walked down to the other end of the  hall of this building and began to seek  to debate the Senate\u2014the Senate leadership, that is\u2014and Democratic Party  on why they are so intent on stopping  legislation that could put people back  to work.  There are many besides the President, in addition to the President, who  say this is a do-nothing Congress; and  because the Senate does so very little,  they give credence to that argument.  One need only look to all the bills we  have been passing here in the House  that could help the economy, would  help the economy, would put people  back to work, would bring down dramatically the cost of energy, which  would bring down  inflation and the  stagnation and stagflation that\u2019s been  put in place by this President and, actually, the 2 years prior to this President when  our Democratic  friends  across  the aisle controlled Congress  and jumped up spending like we could  not have anticipated.  Our friends across the aisle correctly  pointed out that Republicans in 2006  were spending too much money. They  were right  in pointing out that we  should never be spending $160 billion  more than we were taking  in. They  were right.  As a result of their being right on  that  and  their  promises  that  they  would rein in that runaway spending,  our friends across the aisle were given  the majority in November of 2006.  b1710  What followed in 2007, 2008, 2009, and  2010 under  the Democratic majority  was runaway spending at a level never  even dreamed of, at least on our side of  the aisle.  Who would have ever dreamed that  the same party that condemned Republicans\u2014correctly\u2014for overspending the  amount of money coming into the Federal Treasury by $160 billion would up  that ante and overspend by 10 times  that much? Over a $1.5 trillion deficit  in just 1 year. It is just unfathomable.

            "46": "H8182  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014HOUSE December 6, 2011  evening. One, I called the head of one  of our major railroads the other day  because I was trying to get the word  out across my region\u2014not everybody is  plugged into the Internet\u2014that there  were 4,000 jobs that CSX was offering  around the country. I wanted to make  sure that people in our region knew  that they were available. The chief executive officer of the company said,  Well, you know, we\u2019ve had 500,000 applications for 4,000 jobs.  The American people want to work.  It  is not that they do not want to  work, as some of our friends on the  other side infer. No, no. They\u2019re looking every day. They\u2019re just not finding  the jobs that existed in past generations. And we know that those  jobs  have been displaced by imports from  places like China. And company after  company that used to be located in our  neighborhoods aren\u2019t there anymore.  So it\u2019s harder to find jobs. We have to  create new  jobs. But  the new ones  aren\u2019t coming on stream fast enough.  The level of desire to work in our country is so much higher. Millions more  people want to work than there are  jobs available right now. And so for  many  families, unemployment  insurance is all that\u2019s left for them. Again,  this Congress is just waiting to the bitter moment rather than acting responsibly to help  families who have  literally built this country and who have  a very good work ethic and want to  work.  So I want to thank the gentlelady  from Texas  (Ms. JACKSON LEE)  for  bringing this subject up and putting a  human  face on what this unemployment really looks like out in the country. If anyone has any doubt, come to  Ohio. Come meet these families who  want to work and are looking every  day.  Of course, the way  it works, you  can\u2019t go into a company. They tell you,  Well, we might have a hundred jobs but  apply to us through the Internet. It\u2019s  like you go into this faceless system  where you can\u2019t really find a human  being.  They\u2019re trying out there in the country. All the economic figures show us\u2014  and the last thing I will say here for  this  segment\u2014Mark  Zandi  from  Moody\u2019s has classified every single expenditure that one can make that gives  the economy more than a dollar for  every dollar expended. Would you believe that if one looks at things like  unemployment  insurance  and  payments to the unemployed, that produces the biggest bang to the economy?  Well over $1.35 for every dollar invested  as opposed to, let\u2019s say, tax credits or  something like that, these arcane tax  provisions, where less than 30 cents is  actually reinvested in the economy.  So unemployment  insurance extensions also make sense  for economic  growth at this very tender time because the people who receive those benefits  spend  them on essentials  that  drive the economy.  I yield to the gentlelady.  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I want  to follow up and put two more numbers  on the record, as you did. You made a  very valid point that here we are at the  last minute. You would think that we  would be  sensitive enough  to know  that families are gathering. Families  want to have a holiday for the children. They\u2019re trying to be the Santa  that they know that the children believe in. They\u2019re trying to make preparations. Families are trying to find  ways to be with loved ones. It may be  gasoline that they may need to drive a  car. If we don\u2019t do this unemployment  insurance, we are poised\u2014unlike if we  did it and we get bang for our buck\u2014to  lose 200,000 jobs. Compound that with  not extending the payroll tax cut and  we\u2019d lose 400,000 jobs. That is almost  600,000 jobs.  I finish by saying the tragedy of your  point about China\u2014and I want to make  it very clear that we love all people.  We wish the best  for the people of  China. It is the policies, the currencies.  But not only do we have this in the  backdrop; we have to fix our own house  so that we\u2019re not building a bridge in  California that has drawn steel and  workers and designers and accountants  from way across the ocean in China.  We\u2019ve got to get our house in order.  And so 600,000\u2014if the payroll tax cut  extension doesn\u2019t go forward, we\u2019re losing 400,000 jobs. And if unemployment  insurance doesn\u2019t go forward, we\u2019re losing 200,000 jobs. Is this the way to welcome the most sacred season for many  faiths and many families of the year of  giving, where we teach our children to  give? Is this what we should be doing  to the American people? Is this what  we should be doing to our soldiers who  will be coming home by the end of December? I think not.  I thank the gentlelady for allowing  me to share these thoughts. I\u2019m only  looking forward to getting our house in  order and getting our holiday house in  order and reflecting on the needs of the  American people and not special interests.  Ms. KAPTUR. I want to thank the  gentlelady  for  those  very  profound  comments tonight and just place on  the record that just in our church last  weekend the priest informed us that  compared to last year he was asking  for people to dig deeper because the  number of baskets and the number of  \u2018\u2018asks\u2019\u2019 was up well over 125. I think  just for our church it\u2019s over 360 now for  this year. For a small congregation,  that\u2019s a bit of a struggle. That\u2019s just  one place, just one corner in America,  repeated in 50 States, in every hamlet.  I appreciate what the gentlelady said  about the spirit of this particular season of light and of giving and that the  people who are out of work have earned  these benefits. They\u2019re not asking for  any handout. They\u2019re asking for the insurance that they earned as a condition of work in order to help have a  merry Christmas and a happy Chanukah and very Eid greeting season.  They\u2019re not asking for anything they  haven\u2019t earned.  JOHN  KAPTUR,  for coming  I thank the gentlelady  down tonight.  Our  leader,  Congressman  GARAMENDIof California, is with us tonight. We thank him so much for reserving this Special Order and for the  incredible leadership that he has exhibited each and every week that we have  been in session. Just a powerful and  sustaining voice on Making It in America and creating jobs here.  Mr.  GARAMENDI.  Ms.  you\u2019ve gone too far. Thank you so very,  very much for picking up.  Tonight is a very special night for  California. We lit the holiday tree in  front of the Capitol. It was a tree that  came from a community very close to  where I was raised in California. I was  out there with the choir from Summerville High School in Tuolumne County,  an area that I represented for some 20  years, and then others around the area.  A beautiful, beautiful tree  from the  Stanislaus National Forest  in California.  There really is much to celebrate and  much to be concerned about in America. We are still a very great country.  We\u2019re the strongest, wealthiest place  on this Earth. We have incredible opportunity and potential. I saw  it  in  those kids that were singing in front of  the Nation\u2019s Capitol this evening. Yet  there\u2019s so much pain, as was pointed  out by you and our colleague  from  Houston earlier.  Americans care about each other.  They  deeply  are  concerned  about  what\u2019s going on in our communities,  and they want solutions to the problem. That\u2019s our task. There\u2019s 435 of us  here and over in the Senate another  100. And, of course, the President. It\u2019s  our task to  find the solutions. The  President has put forth a very powerful  program called the American Jobs Act.  One piece of it has, fortunately, passed.  It was passed just a few days after Veterans Day when I guess we were out at  the parades, and we made promises to  take care of the veterans. Fortunately,  a piece of legislation did pass. Only one  part of the American Jobs Act, though  there\u2019s much more to do.  My colleagues, Ms. KAPTUR, and the  gentlelady from Houston, we\u2019re talking  about a piece of it. The veterans piece  provides employers a very powerful incentive to hire a veteran. A very, very  powerful  incentive. You  can  reduce  your taxes by $2,600 to hire a veteran  that\u2019s been unemployed; a long-term  unemployed veteran, $5,600 reduction  in your taxes; and in addition to that,  the President proposed that if it is a  veteran who is disabled as a result of  their  service,  a  $9,600  reduction  in  taxes.  b1840  That\u2019s right off the tax line. So we\u2019ve  got to get the message out to employers: Hire, put people back to work, the  veterans. It\u2019s one of the elements the  President has proposed in his American  Jobs Act.

            "54": "S8346  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE December 6, 2011  have to suffer any more than they already are for the President\u2019s failure to  turn this jobs crisis around. Unfortunately, the majority leader has yet to  introduce legislation that can actually  pass  the Senate or  the House. One  would think if that is one of the President\u2019s top priorities, then the Democratic leader of the Senate would put  together a proposal that is designed to  actually pass. But we haven\u2019t seen it  yet. We all know what a successful bill  would look like. So I hope the majority  leader comes forward with a real proposal soon because time is running out.  It makes absolutely no sense at a moment when 14 million Americans are  looking for jobs to raise taxes on the  very people we are counting on to create them. That is why the Senate rejected the idea last week on a bipartisan basis.  Look, the Democrats know as well as  we do that this is a terrible idea. They  have seen the same letters I have. The  National Association of Manufacturers  says this tax hike would seriously impair the ability of their members to  put unemployed Americans back  to  work. The Democrats know as well as I  do that four out of five of those who  would be hit by this are business owners, people who create jobs. The only  reason\u2014the only reason\u2014we even went  through this exercise is because it obviously polls well.  So this is what Washington has been  reduced to: a President and a Senate  who would  rather  spend  their  time  doing cheap political theater than giving people the certainty they want.  What we need to do is to step back and  realize that the only reason we are  talking  about  a  one-shot  stimulus  measure nearly 3 years into this Presidency is because of the President\u2019s failure to turn this jobs crisis around. We  need to get beyond the temporary fixes  and start talking about fundamental  tax  reform  that puts  the American  worker in charge of this recovery, not  Washington.  But for now, it is perfectly clear that  the path to an accomplishment on this  issue does not run through tax hikes.  Yesterday, the President warned Congress to keep its word to the American  people and \u2018\u2018don\u2019t raise taxes on them  now.\u2019\u2019 I wish to remind my colleagues  and the President that the Republican  plan is the only plan that meets the  President\u2019s  standard. The President  just warned us: Don\u2019t raise taxes on the  American people. The proposal we offer  is the only one that meets that standard.  If our friends are serious about passing this extension of the payroll tax  cut, they have a choice: We can have  an accomplishment or we can have additional partisan show votes.  f  CONSUMER FINANCIAL  PROTECTION BUREAU  Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,  later this week the Senate will vote on  whether the new Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau  should move  forward with a director before addressing  concerns that have been raised about  the bureau\u2019s lack of transparency or  accountability to the American people.  I understand through press reports  that the President plans to make a big  push for this nominee to the CFPB. Let  me tell my colleagues something the  President hasn\u2019t done when it comes to  this position: In the 7 months since 44  Republicans sent the President a letter  outlining some very serious and very  reasonable concerns about it, he hasn\u2019t  done a  thing  to address  these concerns\u2014not one thing. If he picked up  the phone to talk these  issues over  with  anybody  in  our  conference,  I  haven\u2019t heard about it. If he has put  some thought into how he could ensure  the perfectly  legitimate concerns we  raised in that letter are addressed, he  hasn\u2019t let us in on the game plan.  Here is what we asked for in that letter, which has now been signed by 45  Republican Senators\u2014not 44, 45: All we  asked for before we vote to confirm  anybody to run the CFPB\u2014regardless  of their party affiliation, regardless of  who the President is\u2014are three clear,  simple,  commonsense  reforms  that  would make sure this new agency is accountable to the American people.  No. 1, replace the single director with  a board of directors that would oversee  the bureau. Under the deeply flawed  Dodd-Frank bill, the Director of the  CFPB, by design, is set to lead one of  the least accountable and most powerful agencies in Washington. What we  are saying is no single person who is  unaccountable to the American people  should have that much power. We are  asking for the same structure as the  SEC, the CFTC, the FDIC, the FTC, the  NLRB,  and  the  Consumer Product  Safety Commission\u2014the  same  structure we use anytime we give unelected  bureaucrats new powers that need to be  checked to protect against abuse.  No. 2, subject the bureau to the congressional appropriations process. Subject this new CFPB to the congressional  appropriations  process.  Currently, the CFPB is housed at the Federal Reserve and funded through a percentage of their annual budget, giving  it a funding stream that is completely  unique in government, entirely without a check from the American people  and making it one of the least transparent agencies in Washington. If one  likes the level of accountability over  at the Fed, one will love the CFPB.  A journalist who wanted some information about the Fed\u2019s lending practices recently had to sue to find it out.  This is information not even Congress  could have gotten on its own.  If my colleagues ask me, the American people  should be getting more  transparency out of this administration, not less. We don\u2019t need any more  unelected,  unaccountable  czars  in  Washington.  No. 3, we asked  for a safety and  soundness check for the prudential financial  regulators who  oversee  the  safety and soundness of financial institutions. This would help ensure that we  are not  inadvertently  causing bank  failures through excessive regulations.  Our proposal would do nothing more  than give congressional committees a  proper level of oversight and accountability over this new bureau and ensure  that its decisions were subject to the  checks and balances that were meant  to be inherent in our system\u2014something we owe the American people.  Everybody supports strong and effective  consumer  protection,  but  the  CFPB,  in  its  current  form,  cannot  stand. In its current form, the CFPB  could easily be used for political purposes at the expense of access to credit,  job creation, economic growth, and financial stability.  What is needed is transparency and  accountability. That  is all we have  asked for, and the President has done  nothing to address these concerns. Instead, he has ignored these perfectly legitimate concerns, and now he is suddenly making a push to confirm his  nominee because it fits into some picture he wants to paint about who the  good guys and the bad guys are  in  Washington.  So once again he has used the Senate  floor this week to stage a little political theater. He is setting up a vote he  knows will fail so he can show up afterward and say he is shocked. This is  what passes for leadership right now in  the White House, and it is truly unfortunate.  Look, we all believe Americans need  access to financial products that are  not rigged against them. We just think  nobody should be above oversight, including the overseers. We do not think  a bureau designed to watch Wall Street  should have the ability to squeeze out  hiring on Main Street. Frankly, the  President\u2019s refusal to even consider our  calls  for oversight and transparency  only  serve  to  deepen  our  concerns  about this agency. So, once again, we  call on the President to take these concerns seriously and work with us on  achieving something positive.  The fact is the CFPB needs a drastic  overhaul before any nominee can be  confirmed. This will not come as a surprise to anybody at the White House,  and our doors remain open.  f  NOMINATION OF CAITLIN  HALLIGAN  Mr.  MCCONNELL.  Now,  Madam  President, on yet another topic\u2014there  are a number of things going on this  week\u2014today the Senate will vote on  the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC  Circuit. I will be opposing this nominee, and I would like to explain why.  First and foremost is Ms. Halligan\u2019s  record of advocacy for an activist view  of the judiciary and a legal career that  leads any reasonable person to conclude that she would bring that activism right on to the court.

            "62": "S8354  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE December 6, 2011  nomination. GOP senators\u2014including Scott  Brown\u2014should acknowledge that her views  appear to be well within the  legal mainstream,  and  vote  to  end  the  filibuster  against her. Her nomination deserves, at the  least, an up-or-down confirmation vote.  [From the Washington Post, Nov. 22, 2011]  SENATESHOULDCONFIRMCAITLINHALLIGAN  TOTHED.C. CIRCUITCOURT  (Editorial)  When Caitlin J. Halligan was nominated in  2010 to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the D.C. Circuit, the prestigious 11-member court had two vacancies. Today, there  are three, after Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg  took senior status this fall.  Yet some Senate Republicans argue that  there is no need to install Ms. Halligan because the court\u2019s caseload has shrunk. Others look suspiciously on her purported views  on antiterrorism policy. GOP senators are  grasping at straws to block Ms. Halligan\u2019s  ascension, perhaps in hopes of preserving the  vacancy for a Republican president to fill.  These lawmakers rightly objected to such  tactics when deployed by Democrats to stall  or defeat well-qualified Republican nominees; they should not revert to them now  when a Democrat controls the White House.  Ms. Halligan has had a distinguished career and deserves to be confirmed. A graduate of the Georgetown University Law Center, she clerked for D.C. Circuit Judge Patricia M. Wald and later for Supreme Court  Justice Stephen Breyer. She has served as  head of the appellate practice at a top New  York law firm, as solicitor general in that  state and now as general counsel for the New  York County District Attorney\u2019s Office in  Manhattan. The American Bar Association  gave Ms. Halligan a unanimous well-qualified rating. The Senate Judiciary Committee  approved her nomination seven months ago;  she has been waiting for a floor vote ever  since.  While it is true that caseloads have been  inching downward at the D.C. Circuit, the  decline does not take into account the complexity and scope of the cases that land at  the court. They include direct appeals involving federal regulatory decisions and national  security matters,  including  cases  stemming from the detentions at the U.S.  naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  Critics note that Ms. Halligan\u2019s name appears on a 2004 report by the New York City  Bar Association that lambasted the Bush administration for asserting the legal authority to hold enemy combatants without trial  until the cessation of hostilities; the Supreme Court ultimately endorsed the administration\u2019s position. Ms. Halligan acknowledges that she was a member of the committee that wrote the report but testified  that she was not involved in its development  or writing and said she learned of it only in  2010, while gathering material for the confirmation  process. Ms. Halligan  testified  that she did not agree with the report\u2019s conclusions.  Some critics suggest that Ms. Halligan\u2019s  repudiation is a \u2018\u2018confirmation conversion.\u2019\u2019  Yet no evidence to dispute her account has  emerged during the eight months since her  hearing. The report episode is odd but should  not disqualify Ms. Halligan, given the mountain of evidence that she is a smart and well-  qualified candidate.  FRANKLINCOUNTY,  Malone, NY, February 14, 2011.  Senator PATRICKJ. LEAHY,  Chairman, U.S. Committee on  the Judiciary,  Dirksen  Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.  DEARCHAIRMANLEAHY: I once discussed on  a plane ride to Washington with you your  time as a Prosecutor. Today it is my pleasure and honor to write a letter supporting  the  nomination  of  a  fellow  prosecutor,  Caitlin J. Halligan, for the DC Circuit Court  of Appeals.  In my  service as District Attorney of  Franklin County in rural upstate New York  and as President of the District Attorneys  Association of the State of New York, I have  had the distinct privilege of working closely  with Ms. Halligan during the past year. In  her position as General Counsel to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr.,  she has consistently demonstrated her unconditional support of the interests of law  enforcement and has lent her exceptional expertise as an advocate for the rule of law to  the complex issues that confront our state  across its many varied interests.  Having first heard of Ms. Halligan\u2019s remarkable legal abilities during her tenure as  Solicitor General of New York State under  Governor George Pataki, I am delighted now  to have learned firsthand that she is a consummate \u2018\u2018lawyer\u2019s lawyer\u2019\u2019. She has unparalleled legal reasoning skills and a firm commitment to our constitutional values.  Thank you for this opportunity to express  my support for this exceptional judicial candidate.  Very truly yours,  DEREKP. CHAMPAGNE,  District Attorney.  COUNTYOFONONDAGA,  Syracuse, NY, February 16, 2011.  Re Caitlin Halligan.  Senator PATRICKLEAHY,  Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.  DEARSENATORLEAHY: I write this letter in  support of  the President\u2019s nomination of  Caitlin Halligan for the United States Court  of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  By way of a brief introduction, I am a career prosecutor, having served twenty years  as the elected District Attorney of Onondaga  County (just under a half a million population) in Upstate New York and ten years as  an assistant district attorney prior to that. I  am the New York State representative to the  National District Attorneys Association and  serve on that body\u2019s Executive Committee. I  am also co-chairman of the American Bar  Association\u2019s  Criminal  Justice  Section\u2019s  Committee on Science and Technology and I  have been appointed by Governors Pataki,  Spitzer and Cuomo to serve on New York  State\u2019s Forensic Science Commission. I am a  past President of the New York State District Attorneys Association and currently  serve on its Board of Directors. I am also a  life long Republican, but nobody\u2019s perfect.  Cy Vance is the current District Attorney  of New York county having succeeded the  legendary Bob Morgenthau. Cy  is a good  friend and has quickly established himself in  New York as an outstanding prosecutor and  a resource for his sixty-one other colleagues  throughout the State. And one of the really  great things that Cy does is surround himself  with quality people. A perfect example of  one  of  those  quality  people  is  Caitlin  Halligan, currently Cy\u2019s General Counsel at  the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office.  Caitlin\u2019s re\u00b4sume\u00b4makes it hard to believe  she is only forty-four years old. Educated at  Princeton with a law degree from Georgetown, Caitlin served as law clerk to two of  America\u2019s most illustrious jurists. Her service to my home State of New York has been  both  distinguished  and  invaluable. As  a  member of the Attorney General\u2019s Internet  Bureau, Caitlin helped develop initiatives to  battle on-line fraud and protect individual  privacy. Many of those initiatives are still  employed by local offices. Rising through the  ranks  of  the Attorney General\u2019s Office,  Caitlin for five years served as our State\u2019s  Solicitor General, arguing cases before all  appellate levels, including the United States  Supreme Court. Caitlin\u2019s  reputation was  nothing short of outstanding which is one of  many reasons my friend Cy Vance was lucky  enough to entice her back into public service  as his General Counsel.  I fully understand the political give and  take of the nomination process, particularly  when the position is of such import. Words  uttered and position papers written decades  earlier take on greater significance. Each  party would prefer to have a nominee whose  judicial philosophy is most closely attuned  to their core beliefs. Ultimately, it is the  President\u2019s choice and frankly I do not think  any President, Democrat  or Republican,  could find a more qualified, a more honorable  or  a  finer  candidate  than Caitlin  Halligan.  Sincerely,  WILLIAMJ. FITZPATRICK,  District Attorney.  RICHMONDCOUNTY,  Staten Island, NY, February 25, 2011.  Re Caitlin J. Halligan.  Hon. PATRICKJ. LEAHY,  Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.  DEARSENATORLEAHY: I write in support of  the nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan for a  seat on the United States Court of Appeals  for the D.C. Circuit. Ms. Halligan\u2019s experience and accomplishments as an appellate  lawyer make her an ideal appointee to that  Court.  Ms. Halligan, currently employed by the  New York County District Attorney\u2019s Office  as General Counsel, has served as First Deputy Solicitor General, then Solicitor General  of the State of New York and as head of the  appellate practice section at the New York  law firm of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP.  In her time as First Deputy and then Solicitor General, she was responsible not only  for briefing and arguing her own cases, but  for supervising the appellate litigation conducted by New York State\u2019s Attorney General as well.  In her time in private practice and in the  Office of the New York State Solicitor General, Ms. Halligan has briefed and argued  cases at all levels of appellate courts in the  United States,  ranging  from  the United  States Supreme Court to New York State\u2019s  intermediate appellate court, the Appellate  Division and has also supervised briefs filed  in those courts. The cases in which she has  been involved, either as principal attorney or  supervisor, span such diverse areas as prisoner civil  rights matters, environmental,  voting rights and  free speech  issues, and  commerce clause matters. This breadth of  practice areas\u2014both in terms of the courts  in which Ms. Halligan has appeared and the  nature of the cases in which she has been involved\u2014certainly has provided Ms. Halligan  with the background necessary for success as  a Circuit Court judge, particularly in view of  the wide variety of matters that will come  before Ms. Halligan should she be confirmed  to a seat on the D.C. Circuit.  In short, Ms. Halligan\u2019s experience as an  appellate practitioner and the wide variety  of issues with which she has dealt will serve  her well in her capacity as a Circuit Judge  and I am pleased to offer my support for her  confirmation.  Sincerely,  DANIELM. DONOVAN, Jr.,  District Attorney.

            "70": "S8362  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE December 6, 2011  LATIN AMERICA  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wanted to share with the Senate  today what should be a collective outrage because an American citizen has  now been held behind bars in Cuba for  exactly 2 years.  Alan Gross was working  in Cuba  under a contract with the U.S. Agency  for International Development. He has  devoted his career to helping thousands  of people around the world, working in  development for over 25 years in more  than 50 countries.  In Cuba, Alan Gross was trying to  make a difference in the lives of people  who share his Jewish faith by bringing  them modern  communication  tools.  For that simple act, he has now languished in a Cuban prison for 2 years.  His health worsens each day and his  family, of course, misses him. His wife  Judy spoke to him just days ago and  said that Alan sounded \u2018\u2018more hopeless  and more depressed,\u2019\u2019 as one would expect.  The release of Alan Gross must remain front and center in any discussion with or about the Cuban regime.  That is why many of us in this Chamber have joined in writing to the Ambassador of Cuba here\u2014and since we  don\u2019t have diplomatic relations, that  individual is called the Chief of the  Cuban  Interests Section\u2014and asking  the Castro regime to immediately and  unconditionally release Alan Gross as a  humanitarian gesture and a sign of  compassion  for his  family. We have  been met, however, with stonewalling  silence.  While we remember Mr. Gross and we  keep pressure on the Castro regime,  the Senate must also fulfill its duties  toward the rest of the Western Hemisphere. A case in point: Four countries  in Latin America\u2014Venezuela, Bolivia,  Nicaragua, and Ecuador\u2014are currently  without a U.S. Ambassador. That is the  job of the Senate\u2014to confirm appointments of the President. In the case of  Venezuela, it is not because we don\u2019t  have a nominee, it is because, in fact,  we are having some trouble with the  Chavez  government. We  have  been  without  an Assistant  Secretary  of  State for Western Hemisphere Affairs  since July. It isn\u2019t in the interest of  the United States not to have these  people in place.  The Senate has basically 2 weeks to  go  if we get out a week before the  Christmas holiday\u2014and that is an \u2018\u2018if,\u2019\u2019  by the way. During this time, while we  go through all of what we have to do in  the next 10 legislative days\u2014such as  solving the doctors problem, extending  this payroll  tax cut, appropriations  bills, extending unemployment compensation for people who desperately  need it, and extending a lot of the tax  extenders\u2014we must also fulfill our constitutional duty to consider these important Presidential appointments.  There is one in front of the Senate  right now; that is, the Ambassador to  El Salvador. Mari Carmen Aponte is  the U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador.  She is well known all over the United  States in Hispanic circles because she  has held, as a Foreign Service officer, a  number of posts. During the August  2010 congressional recess, the President  named her Ambassador to El Salvador.  That recess appointment is going to expire at the end of this year.  Before joining the State Department,  Ms. Aponte served as Executive Director of the Puerto Rican Federal Affairs  Administration and president of the  very respected Hispanic National Bar  Association.  Typical of the sentiment in Florida,  an editorial in a recent Miami Herald  editorial expressed support for her confirmation, saying that \u2018\u2018her diplomatic  success has earned her the unprecedented support of the private sector  and of the most prominent political  leaders in El Salvador.\u2019\u2019 It was unprecedented that three former Presidents of  El Salvador came all the way to Washington to show their support during her  nomination hearing.  My wife Grace and I were recently  visited by the First Lady of El Salvador. She pointed out all of the terrible events that have taken place in  her country: struggling to recover from  the tropical depression that made landfall this past fall, the heavy rains that  have caused major damage throughout  Central America, and the 70,000 Salvadorans still living in shelters. That little country faces many challenges. So  if for no other reason than those I mentioned, we do not want to continue into  next year without our having an ambassador there. We need to confirm Ms.  Aponte as soon as possible so that she  can continue exercising the necessary  U.S. leadership.  Latin American countries continue  to be America\u2019s fastest growing trade  partners. We need to continue to promote that trade. It helps our economy.  It deepens the economic linkages. We  can explore clean energy  initiatives,  and we can help them as they continue  to strengthen transparency in government and the rule of law. We need to  pay more attention to Latin America,  not less. Disengagement is not the answer. This is just another reason we  need to confirm this nomination as  quickly as possible for Ambassador to  El Salvador.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  clerk will call the roll.  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to  call the roll.  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I  ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The  f  RETIREMENT OF JOHN KATZ  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I  rise today to honor a gentleman by the  name of John Katz. John is a longtime  public servant to the State of Alaska  who is set to retire at year\u2019s end. John  has served Alaska  for more than 40  years, working for eight different Governors, Republican  and Democratic,  liberals and conservatives. He once said  he was comfortable serving so many  different Governors because the issues  for Alaska were consistent. Whether  they be responsible resource development, State sovereignty, or Federal assistance with infrastructure, the one  constant figure connecting one administration after the next over eight administrations has been John Katz.  John started his career as a high  school teacher and coach in Baltimore  City public schools back in 1966, following his graduation from Johns Hopkins University. In 1969, he earned his  law degree from the University of California at Berkeley. He then moved to  Alaska to work as a legislative and administrative assistant to Congressman  Pollock and then later for Senator Ted  Stevens.  John has truly played many crucial  roles for the State of Alaska. He served  for several years as the counsel to the  Joint Federal-State Land Use Planning  Commission for the State of Alaska. He  served as special counsel to Gov. Jay  Hammond back in 1979, advocating the  State\u2019s position on  the Alaska National  Interest  Lands  Conservation  Act, or ANILCA,  to Congress. Two  years after that, he was appointed commissioner of natural resources by Governor Hammond. Then, in 1983, John  was sent by Gov. Bill Sheffield to head  Alaska\u2019s Washington, DC, office, and  he has served as the liaison between  the State and the Federal Government  for the past 28 years\u2014a pretty remarkable record, if you would consider it.  As Alaskans, we know how important  his role has been in bridging the very  considerable gap between our State and  the Federal Government\u2014a key role  when more than 60 percent of Alaska\u2019s  land is controlled by the Federal Government.  You could refer to John as Alaska\u2019s  fourth Congressman\u2014his 40-year tenure in the league of the late Senator  Stevens  and  Representative  Don  YOUNG. John\u2019s breadth of knowledge  and understanding of Alaska\u2019s issues  have guided him  in his very unique  role.  Since entering public service, John  has been involved in key issues, such as  the passage of the  landmark Alaska  Native Claims Settlement Act back in  1971, the legislation in 1976 which extended America\u2019s fishery zones to 200  miles which allowed for the Americanization of Alaska\u2019s fishing fleet. There  was also the passage back in 1980 of the  Alaska National  Interest Land Conservation Act, the Nation\u2019s largest conservation lands measure. There was the  Alaska Railroad Transfer Act back in  1983, the Tongass Timber Reform Act  in 1990 and 30 other major pieces of legislation and hundreds of amendments  that have greatly affected the lives of  all Alaskans.

            "78": "S8370  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014SENATE December 6, 2011  The Consumers Union\u2014one of  the  leading  consumer  advocates  in  the  United States\u2014is urging Congress to  confirm Mr. Cordray so the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau can tackle other critical consumer protections  such as reducing the penalty fees and  punitive  interest  rates  banks  can  charge, requiring credit rating agencies  to maintain accurate consumer credit  files, and investigate and fix errors reported by consumers. I know the Presiding Officer has heard stories about  consumers who are operating in good  faith and then they come to find out  their credit files are not accurate and  they are penalized because of that situation. The CFPB could require credit  agencies to maintain accurate files.  Finally, the CFPB could police the  mortgage  market  to  stop  scams  against consumers and prevent the return of the toxic loans and the dangerous lending practices that led to the  foreclosure crisis and, ultimately, the  recession.  I don\u2019t think I am overstating the  situation when I say there are still a  slew of unsafe financial products and  services in the marketplace. When consumers are lured into those traps, they  then can get into a high-interest debt  situation, and then that affects all of  us. It affects our economic health more  broadly. So the CFPB would be given  the capacity to tackle these abusive  and deceptive practices and then be on  the lookout for the next breed of financial scam.  For these reasons, it is my hope the  Senate will take action quickly to confirm Mr. Cordray\u2019s nomination and  then put in place an effective consumer  financial watchdog to ensure Americans get the tools they need to take  control of their own financial destinies.  It will help our economy; it will help  Americans;  it will help  small businesses. This  is  the  right approach.  Let\u2019s confirm this gentleman to head  the CFPB.  I thank the Chair, and I yield the  floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.  f  HONORING FATHER EMIL KAPAUN  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, a few  weeks ago, in November, in communities across our country, our Nation\u2019s  men and women in uniform were honored on Veterans Day for their service  to our Nation. I wish to share a story  with my colleagues of one exceptional  Kansas veteran who is no longer with  us but whose story stands as a lasting  tribute to the members of our Armed  Forces whose courage and sacrifice preserve our freedoms.  Father Emil Kapaun was born  in  Pilsen, KS,  in 1916 and served as a  Catholic priest in the diocese of Wichita for 4 years before volunteering for  the U.S. Army in 1944. During the Korean war, he served as a chaplain for  the 8th Calvary Regiment of the First  Army Division.  His courageous actions in the Korean  battlefields saved countless lives as he  ran under enemy fire to rescue wounded soldiers. When Father Kapaun was  taken prisoner in 1950, he continued to  live out  the Army chaplain motto:  \u2018\u2018For God and country.\u2019\u2019  In the bitter cold of winter, Father  Kapaun carried his injured comrades  on his back during  forced marches  through snow and ice, gave away his  meager food rations, and cared for the  sick who were suffering alongside him  in  the prison  camp. When all  else  looked  hopeless,  this  simple  priest  from Kansas rallied his comrades, regardless of their  faith, to persevere,  until his own death as a prisoner of war  in 1951. This good man distinguished  himself by laying down his life for the  sake of others.  Earlier this year, Senator ROBERTS  and I introduced legislation to award  this Kansas war hero the Medal of  Honor for his acts of valor in the Korean war. The legislation would request  and provide the Department of Defense  and the President with the authority  to grant  this  important honor. By  waiving the 3-year statute of limitations\u2014the timeframe in which it can  be awarded\u2014Father Kapaun would be  eligible to receive the Medal of Honor.  Senator ROBERTS and I offered this  legislation recently as an amendment  to the Senate Defense authorization  bill and the amendment was unanimously  approved  by  the Senate.  I  thank Senators LEVINand MCCAIN for  their support. My Kansas colleagues in  the House were also successful in including  this  language  in  the House  version of the National Defense Authorization Act, and I ask that with  such strong support from both Chambers this provision be included in this  year\u2019s final Defense authorization bill.  Father Kapaun is most deserving of  the distinguished award and I am hopeful the Secretary of Defense and President Obama will use the authority outlined in this legislation to give Father  Kapaun his long overdue recognition.  At this special season of the year, we  are reminded that there are saints and  heroes throughout the history of our  Nation who put others above themselves and live by God\u2019s plan for their  lives. May we be inspired by their example and live our lives accordingly.  Father Kapaun demonstrated that one  person can make a difference and help  change the world.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.  f  WORK WELL TOGETHER  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,  I wish to speak this afternoon about a  lesson that Washington, DC can learn  from Maryville, TN, which is my hometown. It is a lesson that most of us  learned in kindergarten and I learned  in my mother\u2019s kindergarten, which  was in a converted garage in our backyard, and it was three words: \u2018\u2018Work  well together.\u2019\u2019  The latest example of that was all  over the sports pages of my hometown  on Sunday:  \u2018\u2018Historic Championship:  Maryville Wins the 13th State Title\u2014  Most Ever.\u2019\u2019 Our  football  team has  learned to work well together. They  earned their second consecutive State  championship, as the newspaper said.  They  beat Memphis Whitehaven.  I  watched the game on statewide television. Their record this year was 15  and 0. It was their ninth State title and  ninth perfect season under an extraordinary coach, George Quarles, who has  won 179 games and lost 13 in his career  in Maryville. This is the most State titles of any school in Tennessee\u2019s history. The  team  scored  35 or more  points in 109 of Coach Quarles\u2019 first 191  games. Maryville has averaged 30 or  more points  in 12 of  its 13 seasons  under coach Quarles and  its  senior  quarterback  this  year,  Patton  Robinette, who has scholarships from  good schools everywhere, was named  the Gatorade Tennessee Football Player of the Year, part of which has to do  with his academic credentials. He has a  straight A-plus average.  This leads me to the second thing  they work well together on in Maryville, TN. The Maryville city schools  were named the best overall school district in the State, based on their academic performance, by the State Collaborative  on Reforming Education.  The Maryville city schools recently received all As on their State math, reading, social studies, science, and writing  assessments. According  to  the Tennessean, Maryville city schools have  the second highest test scores in the  State in reading and math. The high  school was selected as one of three finalists in the prized category of high  schools  \u2018\u2018based primarily on student  achievement gains and progress over  time.\u2019\u2019 More than 80 percent of Maryville High School students were proficient or advanced in math, 88 percent  in reading/language arts. More than 90  percent graduated in 2010 from the high  school. Four  seniors were National  Merit semifinalists. 48 percent of Maryville High School students who took  the ACT college prep test last year met  all four benchmarks for college and career readiness\u2014English, math, reading,  and science\u2014compared to 15 percent  Statewide and 25 percent nationally.  So the football team and the students  have  learned to work well together,  academically  and  athletically,  at  Maryville High School.  How did this all happen? I know a little bit about this. I am a proud graduate, as the Presiding Officer may have  suspected by now, of Maryville High  School. I have wondered about this for  a long time: How could it have had  such success in so many things? It is  not the richest town in the State by a  long shot. Most families in Maryville  would describe themselves as middle  income.  One indicator of why they succeed  and why they achieve so much excellence in so many ways in their schools  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:07 Dec 07, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G06DE6.043 S06DEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 7 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",

NICK J. RAHALL II  OFWESTVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 6, 2011  Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following.  Watching coal-miners at work, you realize  momentarily what different universes people  inhabit.\u2014George Orwell.  George Orwell was humbled by coal miners\u2014brave and earnest individuals who work  hard hours, often in cramped, damp, lamp-lit  corners far below the surface of the Earth. He  was shocked by the living and working conditions he witnessed while he boarded  in  the  coal mining communities of Northern England,  accompanying the miners underground to see,  first-hand,  the hot, horrible conditions under  which they labored.  \u2018\u2018Down there,\u2019\u2019 he wrote, \u2018\u2018where coal is dug  is a sort of world apart which one can quite  easily go  through  life without ever hearing  about. . . . It is so with all types of manual  work; it keeps us alive, and we are oblivious  of its existence. More than anyone else, perhaps, the miner can stand as the type of the  manual worker, not only because his work is  so exaggeratedly awful, but also because it is  so vitally necessary and yet so remote from  our experience, so invisible, as it were, that  we are capable of forgetting it as we forget the  blood in our veins.\u2019\u2019  Even now, in an age of Twitter and reality  TV, when every aspect of life can be beamed  around the world in an instant, it is too easy  to forget about the miner and his daily digging  chores, sequestered far from our view, though  intimately connected to so many of our daily  needs and desires.  Yet, from time to time, something happens  to remind us of that separate world. Unfortunately, that something is, too often, a tragedy,  like the explosion at Massey Energy\u2019s Upper  Big Branch Mine in Southern West Virginia, on  April 5, 2010, that took the lives, far too soon,  of 29 hardworking men.  In the hours following that explosion, reporters from around the Nation flocked to the mine  site, nestled in a rural mountain fold not far  from my home. Every phase of the attempted  rescue effort was  captured and broadcast  around  the globe, and  for many  tense and  worrisome hours, coal miners were very much  on the minds of the world, holding its collective breath and hoping for a miracle\u2014a miracle that was not be.  Now, after the passing of many months, it is  clear that the loss of those 29 miners was not  due to one unpreventable, fateful incident, but,  instead, it was the result of a pervasive, long-  running, callous corporate culture that put production and profit far above people.  It  is no coincidence  that,  today,  the Mine  Safety and Health Administration is releasing  its final report on the UBB disaster. This day,  December 6th\u2014the anniversary of  the 1907  Monongah Mine disaster, the worst mining disaster  in American history\u2014is also  the Congressionally  designated  \u2018\u2018National  Miners  Day.\u2019\u2019  I am proud to have been the author of the  House Resolution that sought to establish this  date as a milestone of national  recognition  and remembrance of America\u2019s miners. It is a  shameful truth that each advance in our Nation\u2019s mine safety system has come only after  a mine disaster. But I hope that this day might  alter that tradition and serve to bring the miner  out from the dark of the mines into the national light for at least one day each year. It  seems to me far preferable that our national  conscience be kindled not by tragedy, but, instead, by celebration.  And so I urge that, at least on this one day  each year,  the Congress and all Americans  will turn our attention to recognizing the contributions that miners have made to our Nation\u2014its  economic  vitality  and  its military  strength. And that we will take this annual opportunity to help ensure that these men and  women are assured of safe, healthy, humane  conditions in which to earn an honest living.  America and American miners deserve no  less.  f  HONORING LEWIS WILLIAMS  HON. KATHY CASTOR  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 6, 2011  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor and highlight the distinguished  life and career of the Honorable Lew Williams,  who passed away sadly on December 3rd,  2011. Mr. Williams was a member of  the  Pinellas County School Board and a local educator. His impact on our community will be felt  for years to come. He leaves behind two children and his wife, Arthurene.  Mr. Williams was elected  to  the Pinellas  County School Board in 2010. However, over  his  lifetime, his  impact was profound. Quiet  and reserved, he chose his words carefully in  a way that would be sure to have the most impact. His colleagues on  the School Board  have noted  that he often had  the ability  to  drive debates to a solution, while being one of  the quietest individuals in the room. In his time  on the Board, he was able to move the district  in a different direction and was instrumental in  leading the fight for changes in the district\u2019s  superintendent position.  Lew Williams was born in Blakely, Georgia,  but moved to Florida at a young age. Growing  up in public housing, he saw education as a  means to future success. Two educators saw  his potential for achievement and helped pay  his way for college. He graduated from Allen  University with a bachelor\u2019s degree and South  Carolina State College with a master\u2019s degree.  Mr. Williams was instilled with the same optimistic belief in those around him. He started  out as a social studies teacher, but eventually  went on to become a principal at five different  Pinellas County schools. In 2010, Mr. Williams  was elected to the School Board seat for District 7. Local educational leaders, such as the  current head of the local teachers union, credit  him  for seeing  leadership  in  them when he  chose to hire them. His hard work, sacrifice  and determination have  truly  impacted our  community and continue to do so.  The Tampa Bay community mourns his loss  and is so thankful for his many years of service to students and our community. I ask that  you and all Americans remember such a remarkable educator for his ability to inspire success in others.  f  HONORING DR. CHARLES  GRINDSTAFF  HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 6, 2011  Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia. Mr. Speaker,  I  submit  these  remarks  in memory  of Dr.  Charles Grindstaff, a great man, devoted educator, and public servant from Southwest Virginia. Dr. Grindstaff  left us on December 2,  2011.  Born on September 3, 1947, in Bluefield, W.  Va., Dr. Grindstaff was  raised  in  the small  town of Bishop, Va. He later earned degrees  from Tazewell High School, East Tennessee  State  University,  Radford  University,  and  NOVA University. After God and  family, Dr.  Grindstaff\u2019s  passion was  education. Since  1969, Dr. Grindstaff\u2014often known simply as  \u2018\u2018Dr. G\u2019\u2019\u2014served students as a  teacher, administrator, and professor in Tazewell County  Public Schools, Horry County, SC Schools,  and at Concord University in Athens, W. Va.  For over 15 years, Dr. Grindstaff also served  the Town of Tazewell as a councilman and as  mayor until the time of his death. He was an  avid sportsman, enjoyed performing  in  local  theatre, and sharing his musical  talents. Dr.  Grindstaff  leaves behind his wife Suzanne,  daughters Heather and Christina, and his son  Andy, as well as three grandchildren.  Dr. Grindstaff, through both his work in the  classroom and  local government,  impacted  countless lives. He was also my District Director Michelle Bostic Jenkins\u2019 principal at Jewell  Ridge Elementary and taught with her mother  for several years. After a flood on the Clinch  River destroyed many of their belongings, Dr.  Grindstaff was there willing to help. He was  well known  for his exceptional goodwill and  dedication  to  the Tazewell community.  I am  honored  to pay  tribute  to  this great man\u2019s  many contributions. His legacy and influence  will be  long  remembered  in Tazewell and  throughout Southwest Virginia. He will be  missed, but never forgotten.
