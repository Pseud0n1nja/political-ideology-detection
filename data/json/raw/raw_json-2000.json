What  this  amendment  does  is  basically recognize and respect the right of individuals and businesses to be able to pledge  property  for  money  for  an agreed  period  of  time.  Essentially, those  businesses  engaged  in  this  type of  transaction,  namely  pawnbrokers, provide  cash  loans  to  people  in  exchange  for  a  pledge  of  personal  property.  The  pawnbroker  charges  interest on  the  loan,  but  the  customer  is  under no  obligation  to  redeem  the  pledged property. When  the  individual  does  not redeem  the  pawned  item  within  the contractual  period,  the  property  becomes  part  of  the  pawnbroker\u2019s  inventory for sale. It does not continue to be the property of the individual. Some debtors have attempted  to  subject  their  pawn  transactions  to  the  operation  of  the  bankruptcy  code\u2019s  automatic  stay,  after  the  time  under  the contract  for  redeeming  the  property has expired. Most courts that have considered the matter have held that if the debtor  or  the  trustee  does  not  redeem the  property  within  a  typical  period  of 60 days from the date of filing for bankruptcy,  then  full  title  to  the  property vests  with  the  pawnbroker.  This  is  the sensible  result,  because  the  debtor  has no obligation to redeem the property. This  is  a  sensible  clarification amendment, without which,  certain  individuals could abuse the system to the detriment  of  other  consumers  who  use and  need  the  pawnbroker\u2019s  services. Let\u2019s  close  this  loophole  and  support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Washington. Mrs.  MURRAY.  Thank  President. (The  remarks  of  Mrs.  pertaining to the introduction of the legislation  are  located  in  today\u2019s  under  \u2018\u2018Statements  on  Introduced  and Joint Resolutions.\u2019\u2019) MURRAY RECORD you,  Bills SenMr. f OF ACT  HATCH.  BANKRUPTCY  REFORM  1999\u2014Continued Mr.  SESSIONS.  Mr.  President,  it  is great  to  be  back  in  session  this  morning  and  see  my  chairman,  Senator I know today he made a big announcement.  He  has  given  his  heart over  the  last  several  months  and  offered  himself  to  the  American  people as  our  next  President.  He  did  so  with integrity.  Throughout  the  year,  he chaired  the  Judiciary  Committee.  We never  slacked  in  our  committee  hearings.  He  was  here  and  missed  hardly any  votes.  So  many  of  our  candidates seem  to  give  up  their  responsibilities in  the  House  or  the  Senate,  but  he  did not  do  so.  He  regularly  cast  his  votes day  after  day.  This  is  the  first  real business  of  the  Senate,  a  day  in  which he  made  an  announcement.  I  know  it was  very  important  to  him  that  he LEY LOTT, TRENT HATCH GRASSwould  not  continue  his  seeking  of  the Presidency,  and  he  is  introducing  and leading  the  fight  for  a  very  important and  historic  bankruptcy  reform  bill that is long overdue. Senator  and  Senator  have  worked  exceedingly  hard  to make  this  bill  a  reality. We  are  on  the verge  of  it  becoming  a  reality.  It  has been  frustrating.  The  last  time  we passed  this  bill  in  the  last  hours  of  the last  Congress,  it  had  over  95  votes  and only  1  or  2  opposing  votes.  It  came  out of  committee  last  year  16\u20132,  with  almost  that many  votes  this  time  in  Judiciary Committee. It is a bill whose time has come. I am glad  we  are  bringing  it  up.  I  thank  the majority  leader,  Senator  for  saying  we  need  to  bring  this  to  a conclusion  and  calling  it  up  for  debate at the beginning. There  has  been  some  suggestion  and some  comments  recently  about  a  decline  in  bankruptcy  filings  this  past year.  One  full-page  ad\u2014I  suppose  designed  to  influence  this  body\u2014was  in one  of  the  local  Washington  papers. The  headline  was,  \u2018\u2018The  Incredible  Disappearing Bankruptcy Problem.\u2019\u2019 Let\u2019s  talk  about  the  numbers.  Chairman HATCH mentioned  those earlier.  In 1980, when we had an economy that was weaker  than  it  is  today,  there  were only  287,000  bankruptcy  filings.  In  1998, less  than  20  years  later, with  the  economy  one  of  the  strongest  we  have  ever had,  the  number  of  personal  bankruptcy  filings  has  skyrocketed  to 1,398,000\u2014a  386-percent  increase.  That is a stunning fact. In  1999  when  the  economy  was  even stronger\u2014we  had  an  even  stronger economy last year than in 1998\u2014we had a  modest  7-percent  reduction  in  bankruptcy  filings.  Some  are  saying  we don\u2019t  need  to  have  any  bankruptcy  reform, that it is a disappearing problem. I  hardly  think  anybody  can  believe that  a  7-percent  reduction,  after  a  386percent  increase,  suggests  in  any  way that we don\u2019t  continue  to have a bankruptcy problem. The  Consumer  Federation  of  America,  which  is  really  hard  left  in  my view,  issued  a  press  release  saying  the crisis  is  over. That  certainly  is not  the fact.  In  1997,  the  National  Bankruptcy Review  Commission,  with  Federal judges  and  bankruptcy  experts  on  it, issued  a  report  that  stated  the  most visible  and  disturbing  fact  about  consumer  bankruptcy  has  been  the  extraordinary  increase  in  filings  in  the last two decades. Since 1980, the rate of consumer  bankruptcies  has  risen  nearly threefold. These are the words of the official  report  of  the  Commission.  Certainly nothing has happened  since  that report was  issued  in 1997 to  indicate we have had any significant permanent reduction. In  1996,  the  number  of  consumer bankruptcy  filings  was  1.1  million.  In 1999,  the  estimated number  of  filings  is 1.3 million. Thus, since the Bankruptcy Review  Commission  complained  about the  alarming  number  of  filings,  the  filings have increased 16 percent. So since the  official  report\u2019s  conclusion  criticizing  and  complaining  and  expressing concern  about  the  large  number  of  filings,  it  has  increased  16  percent  since then. I  believe  we  do  have  a  problem.  We have  a  deep  problem  of  abusive  and  repeat  filers,  people  whose  lawyers  tell them  clever  ways  to  beat  their  legitimate debts. There are a lot of abuses in this  system.  So  while  we  are  happy  we have  had  a  modest  decrease  in  filings, we  have  not  dealt  with  the  fundamental  problem.  The  reason  we  have  a bankruptcy  reform  bill  is  not  because there are a large number of filings. The reason we have this bankruptcy reform bill  is  that  the  system  is  not  working fairly.  Too  many  people  with  high  incomes\u2014$70,000,  $80,000,  $90,000\u2014are  filing  bankruptcy  and  are  not  paying their  debts  when  they  could  easily  do so.  The  moral  question  arises  because the  person  they  owe  may  have  far  less income than they do\u2014maybe it is their neighborhood  garage  mechanic  who worked  on  their  car.  They  may  have greater  income  than  the  people  they owe, who they are not repaying. So we want to make sure the historic principle  of  bankruptcy  is  alive  and well:  That  a  person  can  wipe  out  his debts  and  start  over  again  and  not  be burdened  with  unpayable  debts.  But when  a  person  can  reasonably  pay  a substantial  part  of  those  debts,  we  believe  he  ought  to  do  so.  That  is  what we will be talking about today. The  purpose  of  bankruptcy  reform is\u2014hopefully, we will have  some  reduction  in  filings.  I  do  not  expect  we  will have much of a reduction as a result of this reform, but our basic goal in bankruptcy  reform  is  to  have  a  system  that works better to reduce litigation, to reduce  the  cost.  We  make  it  so  you  do not  have  to  have  a  lawyer  to  represent yourself  on  a  matter  in  bankruptcy court.  We  required  that  persons  be  at least knowledgeable  of  and have  an  opportunity  to  talk  with  a  credit  counseling  agency.  They  are  in  every  locality  in  America.  They  help  people  deal with  their  financial  crises,  short  of  declaring bankruptcy on many occasions. Sometimes  they  will  tell  them,  \u2018\u2018You cannot  handle  it,  you  have  to  go  to bankruptcy.\u2019\u2019  Or  they  may  say  they need  to have a budget and get  the  family  in  and  deal  with  the  fundamental problems,  where  they  are  in  debt,  and start first paying the debts off with the highest interest rates. Our  goal  is  not  primarily  to  reduce bankruptcy  filings.  Our  goal  primarily is  to  end  abuses  and  problems  that have  made  themselves  clear  over  the past  30  years  since  we  last  reviewed bankruptcy.  The  lawyers  have  learned how  to  work  the  system  well.  We  need to create a legal system that has integrity  and  efficiency  and  that  everyone can respect. Mr.  HATCH.  Mr.  President,  I  thank my  colleague  from  Alabama  for  his kind remarks about me.

Agricultural  biotechnology  reduces our dependence on pesticides. Manufacturing processes  based  on  biotechnology  make  it possible to produce paper and chemicals with less  energy,  less  pollution,  and  less  waste. Forensic  technologies  based  on  our  growing knowledge  of  DNA  help  us  exonerate  the  innocent and bring criminals to justice. A  question  is  whether  we  want  to continue  with  a  fixed  number  of  agricultural  uses  or  if  we  want  to  expand them to provide farmers and consumers new  options  and  new  opportunities.  A question  for  some  is  whether  we  want to  be  more  pro-environment  and  prohealth  and  nutrition  than  we  are  anticorporate. Like  many  of  my  colleagues  here  in the  Senate,  I  have  consulted  scores  of scientists in the academic world, in the public  sector  and  in  the  private  sector. I  have  consulted medical  professionals, and  farmers  for  their  practical  experience  regarding  biotechnology.  But  let me  finish  by  reading  you  a  quote  from a  December  25,  1999,  interview  in  \u2018\u2018New Scientist\u2019\u2019  and  you  consider  for  yourself who might be the source: I believe we are  entering an  era now where pagan  beliefs  and  junk  science  are  influencing  public  policy.  GM  foods  and  forestry are both good examples where policy is being influenced  by  arguments  that  have  no  basis in fact or logic. The  source  is  not  a  corporate  leader, a  Senator,  or  a  university  scientist.  It is an ecologist with a Ph.D. That  ecologist  is  Patrick  Moore,  one of the founding members of Greenpeace and  a  veteran  of  the  frontline  against everything  from  whaling  to  nuclear waste since the 1970s. The  scientific  consensus  amongst government  and  academic  scientists  in the  U.S.  is  extraordinary.  The  scientific  community  in  Europe,  some  of whom  I  have  met  with  agree,  but  have been  intimidated  and  silenced.  Please give the scientific and medical communities  the  opportunity  to  speak  to these  complex  issues  before  you  are swayed  by  the  tabloids  in  Europe, those who may have  their head burried in  the  flat  earth,  and  the  vandals  and extremists  who  have  been  condemned even by some of their very own. We have a system in the U.S. to identify  and  evaluate  relative  risk,  and,  if necessary,  mitigate  those  risks.  The focus of international leaders should be on  working  constructively  to  identify and  evaluate  relative  risk  so  that  our people  may  have  safely  the  options  of biotechnology  available  to  them.  The development  of  this  technology  is  not recreational.  It  is  to  solve  real  world problems and the possibilities are truly breathtaking.  There  is  too  much  at stake  for  those  who  know  better  to  remain passive. In  1921,  Missouri\u2019s  renowned  plant scientist,  George  Washington  Carver said:  \u2018\u2018I  wanted  to  know  the  name  of every  stone  and  flower  and  insect  and bird and beast. I wanted to know where it  got  its  color,  where  it  got  its  life\u2014 but  there  was  no  one  to  tell  me.\u2019\u2019  He added  that:  \u2018\u2018No  individual  has  any right to come into the world and go out of  it  without  leaving  behind  him  distinct and  legitimate reasons  for having passed  through  it.\u2019\u2019 This  issue will be a test  of  our  collective  vision,  discipline, and courage. Madam  President,  I  thank  the  Chair and  my  colleagues.  I  ask  unanimous consent  to  print  in  the  materials  from President Clinton, President Carter, Drs. Prakash  and McGlaughlin, New  Scientist,  and  the  500  scientists\u2019 letter. There  being  no  objection,  the  rials  were  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows: matein  the RECORD NATIONAL BIOTECHNOLOGY [From the White House, Office of the Press Secretary, Jan. 20, 2000] MONTH, 2000 (By the President of the United States of America\u2014A Proclamation) As we  stand  at  the  dawn  of  a  new  century, we  recognize  the  enormous  potential  that biotechnology  holds  for  improving  the  quality  of  life  here  in  the  United  States  and around  the  world.  These  technologies,  which draw  on  our  understanding  of  the  life sciences  to  develop  products  and  solve  problems,  are  progressing  at  an  exponential  rate and  promise  to  make  unprecedented  contributions  to  public  health  and  safety,  a cleaner environment, and prosperity. Today,  a  third  of  all  new  medicines  in  development  are  based  on  biotechnology.  Designed  to  attack  the  underlying  cause  of  an illness,  not  just  its  symptoms,  these  medicines  have  tremendous  potential  to  provide not  only more  effective  treatments,  but  also cures.  With  improved  understanding  of  cellular  and  genetic  processes,  scientists  have opened exciting new avenues of research into treatment  for  devastating  diseases\u2014like Parkinson\u2019s  and  Alzheimer\u2019s,  diabetes,  heart disease,  AIDS,  and  cancer\u2014that  affect  millions  of  Americans.  Biotechnology  has  also given  us  several  new  vaccines,  including  one for  rotavirus,  now  being  tested  clinically, that  could  eradicate  an  illness  responsible for  the  deaths  of  more  than  800,000  infants and children each year. The  impact  of  biotechnology  is  far-reaching.  Bioremediation  technologies  are  cleaning  our  environment  by  removing  toxic  substances  from  contaminated  soils  and  ground water.  Agricultural  biotechnology  reduces our dependence on pesticides. Manufacturing processes  based  on  biotechnology  make  it possible  to  produce  paper  and  chemical  with less  energy,  less  pollution,  and  less  waste. Forensic  technologies  based  on  our  growing knowledge  of  DNA  help  us  exonerate  the  innocent and bring criminals to justice. The biotechnology industry is also improving  lives  through  its  substantial  economic impact.  Biotechnology  has  stimulated  the creation and growth of small businesses, generated new jobs, and encouraged agricultural and  industrial  innovation.  The  industry  currently  employs  more  than  150,000  people  and invests  nearly  $10  billion  a  year  on  research and development. Recognizing the extraordinary promise and benefits  of  this  enterprise,  my  Administration  has  pursued  policies  to  foster  biotechnology  innovations  as  expeditiously  and prudently  as  possible.  We  have  supported steady  increases  in  funding  for  basic  scientific  research at  the National  Institutes of Health  and  other  science  agencies;  accelerated the process for approving new medicines to make  them  available  as  quickly  and  safely  as  possible;  encouraged  private-sector  research  investment  and  small  business  development  through  tax  incentives  and  the Small  Business  Innovation  Research  program; promoted intellectual property protection  and  open  international markets  for  biotechnology  inventions  and  products;  and  developed  public  databases  that  enable  scientists  to  coordinate  their  efforts  in  an  enterprise  that  has  become  one  of  the  world\u2019s finest  examples  of  partnership  among  university-based  researchers,  government,  and private industry. Remarkable  as  its  achievements  have been,  the  biotechnology  enterprise  is  still  in its  infancy.  We  will  reap  even  greater  benefits  as  long  as  we  sustain  the  intellectual partnership  and  public  confidence  that  have moved  biotechnology  forward  thus  far.  We must  strengthen  our  efforts  to  improve science  education  for  all Americans  and  preserve  and  promote  the  freedom  of  scientific inquiry.  We  must  protect  patients  from  the misuse  or  abuse  of  sensitive  medical  information and provide Federal regulatory agencies  with  sufficient  resources  to  maintain sound,  science-based  review  and  regulation of  biotechnology  products.  And  we  must strive  to  ensure  that  science-based  regulatory  program  worldwide  promote  public safety, earn public confidence, and guarantee fair and open international markets. Now,  therefore,  I,  William  J.  Clinton, President  of  the  United  States  of  America, by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  United States,  do  hereby  proclaim  January  2000  as National  Biotechnology  Month.  I  call  upon the  people  of  the  United  States  to  observe this month with  appropriate  programs,  ceremonies, and activities. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand  this  nineteenth  day  of  January,  in  the year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand,  and  of  the Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America the two hundred and twenty-fourth. [From the New York Times, Aug. 26, 1998] WHO\u2019S AFRAID OF GENETIC ENGINEERING? (By Jimmy Carter) Imagine  a  country  placing  such  rigid  restrictions  on  imports  that  people  could  not get  vaccines  and  insulin.  And  imagine  those same  restrictions  being  placed  on  food  products  as  well  as  on  laundry  detergent  and paper. As  far-fetched  as  it  sounds,  many  developing countries and some  industrialized ones may  do  just  that  early  next  year.  They  are being  misled  into  thinking  that  genetically modified  organisms,  everything  from  seeds to  livestock,  and  products  made  from  them are  potential  threats  to  the  public  health and the environment. The new import proposals are being drafted under the auspices of the biodiversity treaty, an  agreement  signed  by  168  nations  at  the 1992  Earth  Summit  in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  The treaty\u2019s  main  goal  is  to  protect  plants  and animals from extinction. In  1996,  nations  ratifying  the  treaty  asked an ad hoc team to determine whether genetically modified organisms could threaten biodiversity.  Under  pressure  from  environmentalists, and with no  supporting data,  the team  decided  that  any  such  organism  could potentially  eliminate  native  plants  and  animals. The  team,  whose  members  mainly  come from  environmental  agencies  in  more  than 100  different  governments,  should  complete its  work  within  six  months  and  present  its final  recommendation  to all  the nations  (the United  States  is  not  among  them)  that  ratified  the  treaty.  If  approved,  these  regulations  would  be  included  in  a  binding  international agreement early next year. But the team has exceeded its mandate. Instead  of  limiting  the  agreement  to  genetic modifications  that  might  threaten  biodiversity,  the  members  are  also  pushing  to  regulate shipments of all genetically modified organisms and the products made from them.

Mr.  Mohamed  Jegham,  the Minister  of  Defense,  told  us  that  while Tunisia  had  good  relations  with  the other  countries  in  the  region,  the  continuing  regional  problems  in  Algeria and  the Western  Sahara were  cause  for some  concern.  The  Defense  Minister told  us  that  Libya  was  not  a  problem for  Tunisia  because  of  Tunisias\u2019  long relationship with  the  country  and with Colonel Khadafi. Following our meeting at the Defense Ministry  we  met  with  Tunisian  President  Zine  El  Abidine  Ben  Ali.  The President  told  us  how  he  would  like  to attract  more  investors  and  business from the United States. As in Morocco, the Eizenstat  Initiative was a point  for discussion  and  because  of  his  country\u2019s stability,  security  and  educational achievements,  the  President  contended that  Tunisia  was  the  perfect  location for  foreign businesses  looking to  locate in  Africa.  On  the  topic  of  Middle  East peace,  President  Ben  Ali  concluded  it was his sense that all parties to the negotiations  were  hopeful.  President  Ben Ali,  who  has  close  ties  to  PLO  Chairman  Arafat  because  of  Arafat\u2019s  residence  in  Tunis  for  12  years,  was  of  the opinion  that  the  peace  process  needed to  conclude  soon  as  the  aging  Arafat and  Syrian  President  Assad  were  perhaps the primary forces uniting and solidifying  both  their  peoples  resolve  in this  matter.  Following  our  meeting with  the  President  we  met  with  Tunisian  Parliamentarians  at  the  Chamber of Deputies after which, the Minister of Foreign Affairs hosted us for a working dinner. The  next  morning  we  departed  for Incirlik  Air  Base,  Turkey  to  discuss the  situation  in  Turkey  and  to  review to  U.S.  participation  in  Operation Northern  Watch.  Incirlik  is  home  to the  U.S.  Air  Force\u2019s  39th  Wing,  which is  comprised  of  roughly  1400  U.S.  Air Force  personnel.  We  were  met  at  the airfield  by  Brigadier  General  Bob Dulaney, U.S. Air Force Commander of the  Combined  Air  Forces  at  Incirlik. General Dulaney  and  his  staff  provided us  with  an  overview  of  the  types  of missions  that  our  outstanding  pilots and  aircrews  were  flying  during  Operation Northern Watch. We were able  to get  a  close  look  at  the  British  Jaguar, a  tactical  reconnaissance  aircraft,  as well  as  an  American  EA\u20136B,  an  electronic  warefare  aircraft  and  an  American F\u201316, an aircraft used  in an air-toair and air-ground combat role. The  allied  pilots  of  Operation  Northern  Watch  fly  in  the  no-fly  zone  which was  created  in  1991  after  the  Gulf  War to  protect  Iraqi  Kurds.  Iraq  has  never accepted  the  validity  of  either  the Northern  no-fly  zone  or  of  the  Southern  no-fly  zone,  which  was  designed  to protect  Shiite  Muslims  in  the  South. Allied jets patrolled the zones virtually unmolested  by  Iraqi  defenses  for  more than  seven  years.  However,  that  soon ended after the four day air offensive of Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, which was  designed  to  punish  the  Iraqi government  for  refusing  to  allow  continued U.N.  inspections of the Iraqi nuclear,  biological  and  chemical  weapons programs.  Iraq  thereafter  declared  the flights  of  Northern  and  Southern Watch as violations of  its sovereign air space.  Now,  virtually  every  patrol flown  by  allied  pilots  is  challenged  by Iraqi  anti  aircraft  artillery  or  surfaceto-air missile fire. Our  next  stop  after  Incirlik  was Israel.  When  we  left  the  U.S.,  Prime Minister  Barak  and  Syrian  Foreign Minister  were  in  Shepardstown,  West Virginia,  discussing  possible  peace  in the  region.  Upon  our  arrival  in  Jerusalem  we  attended  a  working  dinner hosted  by  Mr.  Dan  Meridor,  a  member of the Knesset and the Chairman of the Knesset  Foreign  Affairs  and  Defense Committee. The next morning we had a working  breakfast  with  Aaron  Miller, deputy  to  Ambassador  Dennis  Ross, who  provided  us  with  an  update  on  the discussions  in  Shepardstown  between Israel  and  Syria.  After  breakfast  we boarded  an  Israeli Air Force  helicopter at  the  Knesset  and  flew  to  Palmachim Air  Base  to  review  the  progress  of  the Israeli  Arrow  Missile  Project  which  is designed  to  combat  theater  ballistic missiles,  such  as  the  Scuds  fired  at Israel  by  Iraq  during  Operation  Desert Storm. We were  joined  by Major General Uzi Dayan,  the  Israeli  Defense  Force  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  and  cousin  of  late Moshe  Dayan,  and  once  again  boarded the  helicopter  for  a  flight  to  the  Ben Tal  overlook  in  the  Golan  Heights.  At the  Ben  Tal  overlook,  General  Dayan pointed out the places and towns in the valleys  below where he  fought  the Syrians  in  1973  and  explained  to us  the  obvious  strategic  importance  of  the Golan.  Our  second  stop  in  the  Golan found  us  at  Nimrod\u2019s  Castle,  where  we were  able  to  get  a  better  view  of  the Jordan,  Ammund,  Wabadai  and  Haman Rivers  the  four  tributaries  which  flow into  the  Sea  of  Galilee  and  supply Israel  with  40%  of  it\u2019s  water.  Our  final stop  in  the  Golan  was  Carlucci  Point named  for  former  Secretary  of  Defense Frank  Carlucci.  We  were  met  and briefed  by  the  Commander  of  the Northern  Command,  Major  General Gaby  Ashkenazi.  From  our  vantage point  General  Ashkenzai  pointed  out Southern Lebanon  and  a  nearby  Israeli town, which, because  it\u2019s  large size and close  proximity  to  the  Lebanese  border,  is  the  frequent  target  of Hezbollah Katyusha rocket attacks. We  departed  the Golan  via helicopter and  headed  back  to  Jerusalem  for  a meeting  with  Prime  Minister  Barak. The Prime Minister was in good spirits. He  had  just  returned  from  Washington and  the  negotiations  with  the  Syrians only  the  night  before.  Prime  Minister Barak  reported  that  the  negotiations with  the  Syrians  were  progressing slowly.  The  primary  concerns  of  Israel during  these  talks,  he  explained,  were security,  early  warning,  normalization of  relations  with  Syria  and  water. Prime  Minister  Barak  shared  that  the United States had prepared a document which  outlined  the  concerns  of  both Syria  and  Israel.  He  told  us  the  document  was  a  useful  tool  as  it  put  the otherwise abstract negotiations  in concrete  terms.  The  Prime  Minister thought  that  while  there  was  some movement  in  certain  areas  of  the  Syrian  position,  as  nothing was  final  until the  whole  process  was  final,  the  movement  may  have  been  simply  a  negotiating tactic. Prime Minister Barak was hopeful  that  there would  soon  be  peace discussions  with  Lebanon.  He  felt  that such  talks  would  encourage  the  people of  Israel  concerning  Syria\u2019s  position and  allow  them  to  hope  for  a  comprehensive regional peace. As  members  of  the  Appropriations Committee,  we  discussed  the  cost  of peace  with  Syria  with  the  Prime  Minister.  My  colleagues  and  I  cautioned him  that  the media was  questioning  us regarding the reports that the price  for such  peace  was  going  to  be  in  the  $10\u2013 60  billion  range.  We  discussed  the  difficulty of finding consensus in Congress to  fund  the  Wye  River  Agreement  and advised the Prime Minister to keep the Congress  informed  as  the  process  progressed. Prime Minister Barak told our group  that  it  was  his  hope  that  other countries,  such  as  Japan  and  various other  G\u20137  nations,  would  contribute  to whatever  sum eventually emerged. The Prime  Minister  said  that  the  Camp David  Accord  laid  the  cornerstone  for peace  in  the  region,  the  Wye  River Agreements  built  upon  that  foundation,  and  he  was  now  hopeful  that  the discussions  with  Syria  would  produce the  keystone  which  could  be  put  in place  to  allow  the  full  weight  of  regional peace to come to rest. Discussing  other  security  issues  in the  region,  the  Prime  Minister  told  us that  he  is  \u2018\u2018deeply  disturbed\u2019\u2019  by  both Iran and Iraq\u2019s drive to acquire nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Barak  told us that  he  believed  that  unless  UNSCOM inspections  begin  again,  Iraq  would have  nuclear  weapons  within  5\u20137  years and  that  Iran was  similarly positioned. The next morning our delegation had a working breakfast with Mr. Avraham Shohat,  the  Minister  of  Finance.  Our discussion  once  again  focused  on  the cost  of  any  peace  with  Syria.  The  Finance  Minister,  like  Prime  Minister Barak,  was  hopeful  that  other  countries  would  contribute  in  addition  to the  United  States.  We  departed  later that  morning  from  Israel  and  returned to  Andrews  Air  Force  Base  later  that evening  after  nine  long,  but  informative days abroad. I thank the Chair. I thank my distinguished  colleague  from  Iowa  for  yielding the time. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Virginia. Mr.  WARNER.

            "28": "S76 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) January 26, 2000 work together with other communities, parents,  obviously  teachers  and schools, treatment centers. In  addition,  treatment  is  so  important.  So  many  people  are  arrested  for meth  use  or  for  peddling  meth.  They are  addicted.  They  are  put  in  prison. What  happens?  After  they  are  out  of prison, they are back on meth. There is virtually  no  treatment  or  there  is  very little  treatment  of  incarcerated  persons  in  prison  because  of  meth.  There has  to  be  treatment.  Treatment  is tough. Treatment  takes a  long  time.  It takes more  than  30 days.  It  takes more than  60  days.  It  takes  more  than  90 days.  Treatment  usually  takes  up  to  1 to 2 years. Halfway houses, you have to stick with  it. You have to stick with  it if we are going to solve it. Look at  it this way: If we  leave meth users  alone  in  the  community,  it  is going  to  cost  the  community,  estimates  are,  $38,000,  $39,000,  $40,000  a year.  That  is  the  cost  of  that meth-addicted user  to  communities, whether  it is  in  crimes,  stealing  to  support  the habit,  all  the  ways  that  addicted  meth users  are  destructive  to  a  community. To put that same person in prison, it is going  to  be  very  costly;  that  is,  prison without  treatment.  It  is  going  to  cost maybe  up  to  $30,000.  Incarceration today  costs  about  $30,000  a  person  a year.  Treatment  alone  is  about  $6,000 to  $8,000.  Treatment  in  prison  is  going to  be  less  than  letting  the  person  free out  on  the  street  in  the  community.  It pays. Taxpayers,  rise  up.  Recognize  your tax  dollars  are  spent  much  more  efficiently  with  treatment,  treatment  of addicted  meth  users  in  prison,  than without  the  treatment,  working  with law  enforcement  officials,  coordinating all your efforts. Again,  I  emphasize  that  final  point. Methamphetamine  is  a  national  problem.  It  is  a  State  problem,  but  it  is more  a  community  solution,  all  the peoples  of  the  communities  working together,  certainly  with  States  and certainly  with  Uncle  Sam,  but  you have to do it together as a well-knit effort.  That  is  how  we  will  solve  this scourge in this country. I thank the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Utah. Mr.  HATCH.  Mr.  President,  I  compliment  the  Senator  from  Montana  for his  eloquent  remarks  on  methamphetamine  and  the  destruction  it  is  wreaking not only on Western States  such as Montana  and  Utah  but  throughout  the country.  We  passed  a  methamphetamine  bill  out  of  the  Senate.  We  have to  get  it  through  the  House.  I  ask  my dear  friend  from  Montana  to  help  us work  with  House  Members  to  get  that through.  If we  get  that  through,  it will immediately start taking effect. What  these  kids  don\u2019t  realize,  and their  parents,  is  once  they  are  hooked on meth,  it  is  almost  impossible  to  get them  off.  I  had  a  situation  where  a very  strong  friend  of mine  had  a  son,  a good kid, but he was picked up and put SenBAUCUS in jail once for meth. He promised to be OK.  He  had  quite  a  bit  of  time  to  get OK, came outside, he had perfect intentions,  wanted  to  be  everything  he  possibly could be. Then, all of a sudden, he started making meth  in his apartment, got  picked  up  again.  The  father  called me  and  said:  I  know  he  has  to  go  to jail.  I  hope  you  can  get  the  help  for him. I  called  the  top  people  and  they  said they  will  try  and  get  him  into  a  Federal  rehabilitation  center,  but  it would take at  least  3 years  just  to get him  to be able  to handle  it, not  ever get  rid of the desire, but just to handle it. So you parents out there, if you don\u2019t realize  how  important  what  Senator has been  talking about  is,  then you  better  start  thinking.  If  your  kids get hooked  on meth,  it  is  going  to  be  a long,  hard  road  to  get  them  off.  Their lives may be gone. We  have  to  pass  that  bill.  I  appreciate  the  distinguished  Senator\u2019s  remarks  for  the  most  part.  I  thank  him for  being  here.  I  hope  we  will  all  work together  to  get  that  bill  through  Congress  so  we  can  solve  this  terrible scourge. Mr. BAUCUS.  I  hope  not  only  for  the most  part  but  for  the  whole  part,  Mr. President.  The  Senator  from  Utah  is exactly  correct.  I  must  confess,  I learned  a  lot  about  the  scourge  this past  week  when  Gen.  Barry  McCaffrey was in Billings for a whole day and half the  next  day  with  his  people,  meeting with  treatment  people  the  whole  time, various  aspects  of  the  people  who  deal with  this.  It  is  one  big  problem,  as  the Senator  from Utah  said.  It  is  really  vicious  stuff.  Once  you  are  on  it,  it  is worse  than  cocaine  or  heroin.  It  is harder  to  withdraw.  The  treatment  is longer. I mean, this is wicked stuff. I might add, one fact I learned is that in  our  State\u2014and  I  hope  it  is  not  true in  Utah\u2014we  have  a  high  percentage  of users  who  shoot  it  with  needles,  or  IV. Therefore,  if  we  don\u2019t  stamp  it  out,  we are  going  to  face  a  high  incidence  of hepatitis  C  and  HIV.  Dr.  Green,  an  expert  on  the  subject  in  Billings,  was shocked last week when he came to understand  the  high  rate  of  users who  inject meth  instead of taking  it orally or smoking it. All  I  say  is  that  I  hope  parents  communities  will  rally  and  knock  thing out. It is really bad stuff. Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague. It is  a  real  problem,  and  we  have  to  do something about it. I appreciate his remarks. and this f MORNING  BUSINESS Mr.  HATCH.  Mr.  President,  I  ask unanimous  consent  that  there  be  a  period  for  the  transaction  of  routine morning  business,  with  Senators  permitted  to  speak  therein  for  up  to  10 minutes each. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  objection, it is so ordered. Without LOTT RECORD LOTT SUPERFUND  EQUITY RECORD CONGRESSIONAL CONGRESSIONAL RECYCLING  ACT Mr.  DASCHLE.  Mr.  President,  I  take this  opportunity  to  correct  an  inadvertent  but  significant  error  in  the of  November 19, 1999, the last day of the first session of  this  Congress.  It  concerns  a  statement submitted for the RECORD by Senator  (145  S15048)  regarding  the  Superfund  Recycling  Equity  Act,  which  was  passed  as part  of  the  Intellectual  Property  and Communications  Omnibus  Reform  Act of  1999. The  statement  erroneously was attributed  to  both  Senator  and me. In  fact, the statement did not then and  does  not  now  reflect  my  understanding  of  the  Superfund  recycling amendments. I  make  this  clarification  at  the  earliest  opportunity,  in  order  to minimize the  possibility  of  any  mistaken  reliance on the statement as the consensus view  of  two  original  cosponsors,  particularly  with  respect  to  the  availability  of  relief  in  pending  cases.  It  is not. The  recycling  amendments  were passed as part of the end of year appropriations  process  and  did  not  have  the benefit  of  hearings,  debates,  or  substantive  committee  consideration  during  the  106th  legislative  session.  Thus, there is no conference report, and there are  no  committee  reports  or  hearing transcripts,  to  guide  interpretation  of the bill. However,  much,  though  not  all,  of the  language  in  the  recycling  amendments  originated  in  the  103d  Congress. At that time, key stakeholders, including  EPA,  members  of  the  environmental  community  and  the  recycling industry,  agreed  on  recycling  provisions  as  part  of  efforts  to  pass  a  comprehensive  Superfund  reform  bill.  Although  Superfund  reform  legislation did not  reach  the  floor  in  the  103d Congress,  it  was  reported  by  the  major Committees  of  jurisdiction  in  both  the Senate  (S.  1834)  and  the House with  bipartisan  support.  In  reporting  these bills  in  the  103d  Congress,  the  Senate Environment  and  Public  Works  Committee,  the  House  Energy  and  Commerce  Committee,  and  the  House  Public  Works  and  Transportation  Committee  each  produced  reports  that  include  discussions  of  the  recycling  provisions. Since  the  recycling  provisions  of  S. 1834  were  identical  in  most  respects  to the  Superfund Recycling  Equity Act  of 1999, and the meaning of key provisions of  that  bill  were  actively  considered and  discussed,  the  Senate  Committee Report  contains  probably  the  best  description of the consensus on the meaning of those provisions. To  the  extent  the  Committee  Report does  not  address  a  particular  provision of the recycling amendments, the Committee may very well have chosen to be silent  on  the  point.  With  respect  to such  provisions,  the  \u2018\u2018plain  language\u2019\u2019 of the statute must be our guide.

The resolution reads as follows: familiar  with  all S. CON. RES. 79 \u00b4 \u00b4 Whereas  Elia n  Gonza lez,  a  6-year-old  citizen of Cuba, lost his mother in a tragic boat accident and floated alone for days in treacherous conditions off the coast of Florida; \u00b4 \u00b4 Whereas  Elia n  Gonza lez  was  found  November  25,  1999,  alive  but  physically  and  emotionally  drained,  brought  ashore  and  examined  at  a  hospital,  and  released  temporarily by the Immigration and Naturalization Service  (INS)  into the care of his great-uncle and cousins  in  the Miami area while  it evaluated his case; Whereas  the  natural  father  and  sole  sur\u00b4 \u00b4 viving  parent  of  Elia n  Gonza lez.  Juan \u00b4 Gonza lez  of  Cuba,  has  repeatedly  requested that  the  United  States  Government  return his son to him immediately; Whereas  the  President  rightly  determined \u00b4 \u00b4 that  the  fate  of Elia n Gonza lez  should  be  determined  by  United  States  statutes  and  regulations  related  to  immigration  cases  involving children; Whereas  \u00b4 the  INS,  after  interviewing  Juan Gonza lez twice  in Cuba and carefully reviewing  all  relevant  laws,  rules,  and  evidence, correctly determined on January 5, 2000, that \u00b4 Juan  Gonza lez  is  a  caring  and  involved  fa\u00b4 \u00b4 ther,  that  Elia n  Gonza lez  faces  no  credible threat  of  political  persecution  if  returned  to his  father,  and  as  a  result,  that  Juan \u00b4 Gonza lez  possesses  the  sole  authority  of \u00b4 \u00b4 speaking  for  Elia n  Gonza lez  regarding  his son\u2019s  immigration  status  in  the  United States  under  Federal  immigration  law  and universally accepted legal norms; \u00b4 Whereas  the  INS  resolved  to  return  Elia n to  Cuba  by  January  \u00b4 14,  2000,  to  live  with  his father Juan Gonza lez,  in accordance with his father\u2019s request; Whereas  on  January  12,  2000,  the  Attorney General  fully  supported  the  INS  ruling,  reaffirmed  INS  jurisdiction  over  the  matter, and  said  that  a  decision  by  a  Florida  State court  judge  granting  temporary  custody  of \u00b4 \u00b4 Elia n Gonza lez  to  his  relatives  in Miami,  establishing a March  6,  2000, date  for a hearing on permanent custody, and calling for the father\u2019s  presence  at  that  hearing  had  no  force and effect; Whereas  only  the  Federal  courts  have  the jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s decision; \u00b4 \u00b4 Whereas  what  Elia n  Gonza lez  needs  most at this time is to be with the father and both sets  of  grandparents  who  raised  him  so  that he  can  begin  the  process  of  grieving  for  his mother, in peace; Whereas despite the existence of important political  disagreements  between  the  Governments  of  the  United  States  and  Cuba,  these differences  should  not  interfere  with  the right  to  privacy  of  a  6-year-old  child  or  his sacred bond with his father; and Whereas  any  unusual  or  inappropriate changes  to  immigration  law  made  by  Congress  to  naturalize  a minor  without  the  parents\u2019  consent  would  have  the  effect  of  encouraging  parents  in  other  nations  to  risk the  lives  of  their  children  under  the  false hope  that  they  might  receive  special  treatment outside standard channels  for  legal  immigration: Now, therefore be it Resolved * * * clause  basically  says ought  to  be  returned  to The  resolve  Elian Gonzalez  his father. I send this resolution to the desk. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  It  is  ceived and appropriately referred. Mr. DODD. I appreciate that. I  stated  the  facts  in  that  resolution. Mr.  President,  let  me  state,  again, this  boy  ought  to  be  home  with  his  farether.  We  have  a  significant  disagreement  with  the  Government  of  Fidel Castro.  Those  disagreements  are  not going  to  be  resolved  by  this  case.  But good  families  exist  in  countries  with bad  governments.  The  idea  that  the family  of  Elian  Gonzalez,  because  he lives  under  a  repressive  regime  in Cuba, cannot be a good family is, on its face,  false.  There  are  plenty  of  good families  all  over  this  globe  who  live under  governments  that  we  do  not  approve of. In  this  case,  I  believe\u2014based  on  the examination  by  the  Immigration  and Naturalization  Service  of  Elian  Gonzalez\u2019  father,  and  based  on  all  that  is known  about  his  grandparents  and other  family  members\u2014that  such  a family  exists  in  Cuba.  The  evidence suggests  that  his  father  is  not  only  fit as a parent, but caring and involved, as well.  Despite  the  fact  that  he  was  divorced  from  Elian\u2019s  mother,  the  evidence  suggests  that  he  shared with  her the  responsibility of  raising  this young boy.  Therefore,  I  think  it  is  in  the  interests of this child that he be returned to that family as quickly as possible. That  really  ought  to  settle  this matter.  Based  on  what  we  know  today,  his father  loves  him,  and  wants  him  back. That  is  a  desire  that  every  American parent can understand and share. But  what  has  happened  here,  apparently,  is  that  the  hatred  on  the  part  of some  for  an  old  man  in  Cuba\u2014Fidel Castro\u2014is  interfering  with  the  love  of a  father  and  a  son.  If  there  is  a  debate\u2014and  there  is  between  our  two Governments\u2014let  that  debate  be  conducted by adults. Let us debate the embargo. Let us debate  the  issue  of  food  and  medicine.  I note,  as  I  stand  here,  the  Presiding  Officer  has  been  an  enlightened  and thoughtful  participant  in  that  discussion,  as we  are  trying  to work  our way through  what  is  the  best  way  for  us  to try  to  repair  this  relationship  between the  Governments  of  Cuba  and  the United  States  that  has  gone  on  for  40 years,  to  bring  about  the  kind  of change  in  Cuba  that  would  bring  freedom to the people of Cuba. We  have  said  repeatedly  that  our  argument  is  with  Fidel  Castro  and  his government,  not  with  the  Cuban  people.  Yet,  unfortunately,  in  this  discussion,  it  appears  that  for  some  the  debate  is  with  the  Cuban  people  if  Elian Gonzalez  is  denied  the  opportunity  to return to Cuba to be with his father. I  hope,  again,  as  I  said  a  few  moments  ago,  that  this  matter  will  not come  to  the  floor  of  the  Senate  for  debate,  that  the  leadership,  in  its  wisdom,  will  decide  to  move  on  to  other matters\u2014the  bankruptcy  bill,  the budget  matters  that  we  need  to  discuss,  the  Elementary  and  Secondary Education  Act,  a  Patients\u2019  Bill  of Rights,and  a  minimum  wage  increase, to name  just  a  few. There  is  a  long  list of  issues  for  us  to  debate  and  discuss. But we ought not to debate the custody status  of  a  6-year-old  child  who,  in  the opinion of all who have taken a look at of  SenSenDODD this  issue  from  a  neutral  and  responsible  position,  have  concluded  that Elian  Gonzalez  ought  to  be  home  with his father in Cuba. We ought to instead allow the current legal process to work so that a decision on this boy\u2019s fate can be  rendered  expeditiously  and,  hopefully, in favor of reuniting him with his father. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Illinois. Mr.  DURBIN.  Mr.  President,  I  say  at the outset,  I agree completely with the Senator from Connecticut. I ask unanimous  consent  that  if  my  name  is  not shown as a cosponsor\u2014\u2014 Mr. DODD. It is. Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. I  am  proud  to  be  a  cosponsor  ator DODD\u2019s resolution. What  a  curious  footnote  in  the  history  of  this  world  that  this  Senate Chamber  would  focus  its  debate  and the  attention  of  the  media  in  this country  on  a  little  6-year-old  boy  from Cuba. But  if you  scan history, you will  find similar  cases  where  one  person  being caught  in the vortex of controversy becomes  the  focal  point.  In  this  case,  the focal  point  is  a  6-year-old  boy  named Elian  Gonzalez,  and  at  issue  is  the  foreign  policy  between  the  United  States of America and the Nation of Cuba. Yesterday,  Senator  was  kind enough  to  invite  me,  as  well  as  three other  Senators,  to  meet  with  the grandmothers  of  Elian  Gonzalez.  I  sat and  listened  for  an  hour  as  they  explained  their  family circumstances and answered  our  questions.  It  really brought  me  back  to  that  moment  in time  many  years  ago  when  I  was  a practicing  lawyer  in  Springfield,  IL, and  spent  many  days  involved  in  family  law.  It  was  not  the  most  enjoyable part of my legal practice. In  fact,  many  times  those  cases,  involving  divorce  and  child  custody  and child  support,  unfortunately,  brought out  the  very  worst  in  people.  Those battles  over  children  became  proxy battles  over  a  failed  marriage.  It  saddened me, as I am sure it saddens many who are involved in this. As  I  listened  yesterday,  I  understood that  these  two  grandmothers  were  basically  making  the  case  that  they  had a  good  family  to  offer  in  Cuba,  a  good family  for  Elian  Gonzalez.  I  thought they made their case convincingly. The fact  that  this  young  boy,  after  his  parents  were  divorced,  was  the  subject  of joint  custody  is,  in  and  of  itself,  a  telling  fact.  It  is  rare.  There  are  people who  fight  in  court  for  years  and  spend thousands  of  dollars  over  the  question of joint custody. In  this  case,  Elian  Gonzalez\u2019  mother decided that she could trust her former husband,  the  father  of  Elian,  so  much so  that  she  left  him  with  his  father  5 out  of  7  days  each  week.  That  simple fact told me a great deal about whether or  not  Elian  Gonzalez\u2019  father  was  a  fit parent.  In  the  eyes  of  Elian\u2019s  mother, the  former  wife  of  Elian\u2019s  father,  he certainly was a fit parent.

Under  the Speaker\u2019s announced policy of January 19,  1999,  the  gentleman  from  Illinois (Mr.  is  recognized  during morning hour debates for 5 minutes. Mr.  WELLER.  Mr.  Speaker,  over  the last  several  years,  many  of  us  have been  asking  a  question  that  we  hear time and time again back home.  I have the  privilege  of  representing  the  south side  of  Chicago  and  the  south  suburbs, communities  like  Joliet  and  Lancing and Morris  and  rural  communities  like Tonica  and  elsewhere;  and  they  often ask  me  a  pretty  basic  question.  That question  is,  as  we  talk  about  taxes, they  say,  why?  Why  do  married  working  couples,  a  husband  and  wife  who are both  in  the workforce, why do  they pay  higher  taxes  when  they  get  married?  They  ask,  is  it  right,  is  it  fair that  under  our  Tax  Code,  married working  couples  pay  higher  taxes?  On average,  25  million  married  working couples  pay,  on  average,  $1,400 more  in higher  taxes  than  identical  couples who choose not to get married, but live together  outside  of  marriage.  That  is not right. The  folks  back  home  tell  me  that  it is  time  that  those  of  us  here  in  Washington  should  do  something  about  it, that we  should work  to  eliminate what has  been  called  the  marriage  tax  penalty.  Mr.  Speaker,  $1,400,  the  average marriage tax penalty, is a lot of money back  home  in  Illinois.  Mr.  Speaker, $1,400 is one year\u2019s tuition for a nursing student  at  Joliet  Junior  College,  our local  community  college;  it  is  three months  of  day  care  for  a working mom and dad with children. It is almost 4,000 diapers  for  a  family  with  a  newborn child. It  is  there  money  for  real  people;  and of  course,  some  here  in real  are,  Washington  who  say  they  would  much rather  spend  that money here  in Washington than bring about tax fairness by eliminating the marriage tax penalty. Well,  I  am  proud  to  say  this House  is doing  something  about  the  marriage tax  penalty.  Last  year  we  passed  and sent  legislation  to  the President which would have wiped out  the marriage  tax penalty for over 25 million couples; and unfortunately,  President  Clinton  and Vice  President  Gore  vetoed  that  bill. They had a lot of excuses. They wanted to  spend  that  money.  But  this  year, there is no excuse. We have Valentine\u2019s Day  approaching,  and  what  better  gift to give 25 million married working couples  who  suffer  the  marriage  tax  penalty than to pass legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty. This  Thursday,  we  will  be  considering  in the House  legislation approved by  the  Committee  on Ways  and Means, H.R.  6,  the  Marriage  Tax  Elimination Act,  which  I  am  proud  to  say  now  has 236  cosponsors,  including  almost  30 Democrats  who  have  joined  with  us  in our  effort  to  eliminate  the  marriage tax penalty. We help real people. Let me  introduce  a  couple  here.  This couple  here,  Shad  and  Michelle Hallihan  of  Joliet,  Illinois,  two  public school teachers in Joliet, Illinois. They happen  to  make  about  $60,000  in  combined  income  from  their  two  teaching salaries,  and  Shad  and  Michelle  suffer almost  the  average  marriage  tax  penalty. Well,  under  the  legislation  that  the House  is  going  to  be  considering  this week,  Shad  and  Michelle  will  benefit, because two public school teachers who chose  to  get  married  who  now  suffer the  marriage  tax  penalty  will  essentially  have  their  marriage  tax  penalty wiped  out.  Michelle  told  me  the  other day,  she  says,  Congressman,  tell  your friends  in  the  Congress,  particularly those  who  believe  it  is  not  a  good  idea to  eliminate  the marriage  tax  penalty, what  wiping  out  the marriage  tax  penalty would mean for them. They  say  $1,000,  which  is  essentially the  marriage  tax  penalty,  would  buy 3,000  diapers  for  their  newborn  baby. That  is  money  that  is  currently  going to  Washington  that  they  could  use  to take  care  of  their  child. Frankly,  if we want  to  be  fair,  it  is  their  money.  We should eliminate  the marriage  tax penalty. This  Thursday,  H.R.  6,  the  Marriage Tax  Elimination  Act,  will  help  couples like  Shad  and Michele  Hallihan. We  do it  in  several  ways.  We  double  the standard  deduction.  One-half  of  married couples do not  itemize  their  taxes; they  use  the  standard  deduction,  so we double  it  for  joint  filers.  The  marriage penalty  is  created when  a married  couple  of  course  get  married,  they  file their  taxes  jointly,  their  combined  income  usually  pushes  them  into  a  higher  tax  bracket.  That  is  what  pushes Shad  and  Michelle  into  the  28  percent bracket. What  we  want  to  do,  of  course,  is  for the  nonitemizers,  which  is  about  half of  the  married  couples  who  suffer  the marriage  penalty,  to  double  the  standard deduction for joint filers to make it twice  that  of  singles.  For  those  who itemize, who  are  the  other half  of married  couples  who  suffer  the  marriage tax  penalty,  those  who  itemize  are homeowners.  The  average  middle-class family  itemizes  their  taxes  because they  own  a  home.  We  want  to  help them  and  provide  marriage  tax  relief as  well.  So  we  widen  the  15  percent bracket,  the  basic  tax  bracket  that every  one  of  us  pays. We  are  all  in  the 15 percent bracket, regardless of our income,  for  the  lowest bottom bracket of our  income.  By  widening  the  bracket so  that  joint  filers,  married  couples, can earn twice as much as a single filer and  be  in  that  same  bracket,  we  help those who itemize. We also help the working poor. There is a marriage penalty for the earned income  credit,  and  we  provide  tax  relief for them. This  Thursday,  let  us  have  an  overwhelming  bipartisan  majority.  Let  us work  together.  Let  us  eliminate  the marriage  tax  penalty.  There  are  no  excuses.  We  want  to  be  fair.  Eliminate the marriage tax penalty. f hour  LANTOS)  AND  XENOAUSTRIA: EXTREMISM,  RACISM  PHOBIA  SWEEPING  HOUSE  RESOLUTION  417 The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Under the Speaker\u2019s announced policy of January  19,  1999,  the  gentleman  from  California  (Mr.  is  recognized  during  morning  debates  for  5  minutes. Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker,  last week I  called  the  attention  of my  colleagues to the rise of neofacism in Austria. The deed  is  now  done.  The  extremist,  racist,  xenophobic  FPO  party  has  entered the  Government  of  Austria.  I  want  to thank  all  of  my  colleagues  on  both sides of the aisle who have joined me in supporting  this  resolution  expressing our regret and dismay. Joerg  Haider,  the  leader  of  this party,  had  ample  praise  for  Adolf  Hitler  and  for  SS  veterans  whom  he  described  as  \u2018\u2018decent  people  with  character who stuck to their beliefs.\u2019\u2019 I  want  to  commend  the  European Union,  all  14  nations,  which  have  chosen to downgrade their diplomatic relations with Austria.  I want  to  commend our  own  State  Department  for  recalling  our  Ambassador  to  Austria  and  for promising  to watch developments carefully. At a time, Mr. Speaker, when the European  Union,  the  United  States,  and other  democratic  nations  are  working actively  to  discourage  ethnic  hatred  in the  republics  of  the  former  Yugoslavia and  elsewhere,  Joerg  Haider  and  his neofascist allies are appealing to racist sentiment  and  xenophobia.  Haider learned  this  lesson  early  on. His  father joined  the  Nazi  Party  in  1929.  His mother  was  an  active  and  enthusiastic Nazi  Party  member  as  a  teacher. Haider  has  surely  learned  the  lesson well. VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:23 Feb 09, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K08FE7.003 pfrm02 PsN: H08PT1 ",

The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Is  there objection  to  the  request  of  the  gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  ask  my colleagues to approve S. 632, the Poison Control  Center  Enhancement  and Awareness Act. This  long-overdue  legislation  will provide a stable base of  support  for our Nation\u2019s threatened poison control centers  and  improve  public  education  and awareness  about  these  life-saving  resources. This  Senate  bill  is  the  companion measure to the  legislation that  I  introduced  with  my  colleague  and  friend, the  gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr. TOWNS),  in the  last session of Congress. I  am  pleased  to  note  that  our  bill  enjoys  strong  bipartisan  support,  it  has more  than  130  cosponsors;  and  that  the Senate  bill,  this  bill,  was  approved  by unanimous  consent  under  the  leadership  of  our  Ohio  friend,  Senator  Mike DEWINE. Poison  control  centers  provide  vital, very  cost-effective  services  to  the American  public.  Each  year more  than 2  million  poisonings  are  reported  to poison  control  centers  throughout  the United  States. More  than  90  percent  of these  poisonings  occur  in  the  home, and  more  than  50  percent  of  poisoning victims  are  children  under  the  age  of 16. For every dollar spent on poison control center services,  $7  in medical services  are  saved. But  in  spite  of  their  obvious  value,  poison  control  centers  are indeed in jeopardy. Historically,  these  centers were  typically  funded  by  the  private  and  public sector  hospitals  where  they  were  located. The  transition  to managed  care, however,  has  resulted  in  a  gradual  erosion  of  the  funding.  As  this  funding source  has  been  drying  up,  poison  control  centers  have  only  partially  been able  to  replace  the  support  by  cobbling together  other  State  and  local  and  private funding. The  financial  squeeze  has  forced many  of  the  centers  to  curtail  their poison  prevention  advisory  services and  their  information  and  emergency activities  and  reduce  the  number  of nurses,  pharmacists,  and  physicians answering  the  emergency  telephones. Currently,  there  are  73  centers.  In  1978 there were 661. The  Poison  Control  ment  and  Awareness  Center  EnhanceAct  will  provide BLILEY), DINGELL),  BILIRAKIS),  up  to  $28  million  each  year  over  the next  5  years  to  provide  a  stable  source of  funding  for  these  centers,  to  establish  a  national  toll-free  poison  control hotline,  and  to  improve  public  education on poisoning prevention and poison center services. The  legislation  is  designed  to  ensure that  these  funds  supplement,  not  supplant,  other  funding  that  the  centers may be  receiving and provides  the Secretary  of  Health  and  Human  Services with  the  authority  to  impose  a matching requirement. Further,  to  receive  Federal  funding, a center will have to be certified by the Secretary  of  Health  and  Human  Services  or  an  organizational  expert  in  the field  of  poison  control  designated  by the  Secretary.  I  want  to  recognize  especially  Senator  DEWINE\u2019s  contribution and his leadership. In  addition  to my  colleague,  the  gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr.  TOWNS),  I would especially  like to thank the gentleman  from  Virginia  (Mr.  chairman  of  the  Committee  on  Commerce;  the  gentleman  from  Michigan (Mr.  the  ranking  member; and  the  gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr. the  chairman  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Health  and  the  Environment;  and  the  gentleman  from  Ohio (Mr.  BROWN),  his  ranking  member,  for their  interest  and  leadership  on  this issue. Mr. Speaker,  there  is no  greater  pain or  nightmare  to watch  a  loved  one  suffer for something that we could cure. I can remember, as a new dad, buying those  little  gadgets  and  putting  them on  my  cupboards  in  my  kitchen  to make  sure  that  my  daughter  and  my son would  not  be  able  to  open  those  up and  find  the  detergent  and  bleach  and other  things  that  might  be  in  those cabinets.  But  despite  that  foresight,  it is  not  100  percent  foolproof.  And  when these  things  happen,  we  have  to  make sure  that  every  family  across  this great country has access to an 800 number  where  they  can  immediately  reach out  to  someone  who  knows  what  to  do when that tragedy might strike. That  is  what  this  bill  does,  Mr. Speaker.  It  provides  that  access  so  our kids and our  loved ones can  live. I urge all  of  my  colleagues  to  support  this legislation.  It  is  long  overdue,  and  I look  forward  to  its  passage  this evening. Mr.  Speaker,  my time. Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  join  my colleague  and  friend,  the  gentleman from  Michigan  (Mr.  UPTON),  in  supporting S. 632.

Under  a previous  order  of  the  House,  the  gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr.  is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SWEENEY. Mr. Speaker,  I would like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank SWEENEY) the  TANNER), HERGER)  from genmy  colleagues,  gentleman  California  (Mr.  and  the  tleman  from  Tennessee  (Mr.  for  joining  me  today  as  we  introduce the very important piece of legislation, the  Installment  Tax  Correction  Act  of 2000. This  is  indeed  important  legislation, as  I  said,  introduced  earlier,  which  is intended  to  correct  an  egregious  error committed as part of  the  tax  reconciliation legislation passed last year. This matter affects hundreds of thousands  of  small  business  owners throughout  America,  and  makes  it  a high  priority  for  this  coming  congressional  legislative  session.  That  is  evidenced  by  the  fact,  Mr.  Speaker,  that over  70  of  our  colleagues  have  already joined as cosponsors in this legislation. This legislation is intended to restore an  important  tax  tool  for  small  businesses,  to  allow  small  business  owners to  be  able  to  transfer  their  businesses more  correctly  and  equitably.  Under the accrual method of accounting, owners  of  small  businesses  utilize  installment  payments  to  spread  the  capital gains  tax  burden  of  selling  their  business  over  a  number  of  years,  and  are common  for  situations  where  the  sellers  continue  to  stay  involved  in  the business. In  many  instances,  the  current  Section  536  adversely  affects  the  sale  of closely-held  businesses.  With  many business  sales,  bank  financing  is  either unavailable  or  not  cost-effective,  so often the seller will act as a bank  for a portion  of  the  total  sales  price  and carry  the  note,  receiving  installment payments over a number of years. Under  Section  536,  this  is  still  possible,  but  the  IRS  requires  the  capital gains  they  realize  on  the  sale  to  be  reported  in  1  year,  rather  than  over  the life  of  the  note.  Sadly,  sales  of  businesses  across  the  country  have  already been  disrupted.  Without  the  use  of  installment  arrangements,  small  business  owners  who  seek  to  sell  or  transfer  their  businesses  have  had  to  decrease  their  asking  price.  In  many cases,  the  tax  bill  exceeds  the  first year\u2019s payment, and as a  result,  sellers cannot  afford  to  pay,  and  often  find themselves  abandoning  their  sales  entirely. Mr.  Speaker,  many  owners  rely  on the  sale  of  their  business  to  finance their  retirement.  Without  the  installment  sales  option,  they  have  to  postpone their retirement dreams. In fact, I know  this  firsthand.  Immediately after we  recessed  last  session  of  Congress,  I received  a  number  of  calls  from  constituents  complaining  of  this  very  effect. Mr.  Speaker,  the  loss  of  installment sales  is  not  only  detrimental  to  hundreds  of  thousands  of  small  businesses in  the  country,  or  the  tens  of  thousands  of  small  businesses  upon  which my  district  is  built,  but  it  in  fact  has affected  the  real  ability  for  those  folks to  transfer  their  businesses  and  move on with commerce. In  fact, Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of all businesses  in  my  district  are  small businesses,  including  Mr.  and  Mrs. Long  of  Salt  Point,  New  York,  who currently feel the onerous effect of this provision. Several  months  ago,  Dorothy  and George  Long  arranged  for  the  sale  of their  resort,  located  in  beautiful  Lake George, New York. Unfortunately, they are  now  suffering  the  consequences  of this  provision  in  a  real  and  immediate way. Mr.  and  Mrs.  Long  were  relying  on this  sale  to  finance  their  retirement, and are now faced with one of three options:  one,  they  take  a  loan  out  in order  to  pay  for  the  capital  gains  tax; or  two,  they  break  their  contract  and face a  lawsuit; or three, they suffer the consequences  of  nonpayment  of  taxes. Talk about being put in between a rock and a hard place. What  my  colleagues  and  I  are  proposing  is  a  556  fix.  It  is  essential  that we  work  together  to  stop  the  damage to our local economies, its effect on the hardworking  people  throughout  America. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues  here  today  for  taking  the  first step  with  me  towards  fixing  this  inequity. I ask now that we move expeditiously so that the further damage that we  have  already  caused  on  the  small working  businesspeople  throughout America is mitigated. f The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.

If only the teachers were better  prepared,  if  only  more  teachers were  certified,  if  only  more  teachers understood  what  they  are  doing,  then we could reform the school system. Not  for  one  moment  will  I  disagree that we need quality teachers. We need systems  that  provide  certified  teachers, qualified  teachers,  right across  the board. In  my  district,  one-third  of  the schools  in my  district,  where  the  poorest  children  live,  half  the  teachers  are not  certified.  Each  school  has  at  least 50  percent  not  certified  teachers,  50 percent  unqualified  teachers,  because they have been given a chance, in some cases,  9  or  10  years,  to  get  certified, and some have not wanted to care. Recently  the  United  Federation  of Teachers,  the  teachers  union,  said  to the uncertified teachers, if you want to go back to school, we will pay your tuition.  We  will  make  it  possible  for  you to get certified. They  were  shocked  to  find  that  the majority  of  the  people  they  were  addressing  turned  it  down.  When  they turned  it  down,  they  said  to  the  union people,  \u2018\u2018This  school  system  needs  our bodies.  We  cannot  be  replaced.  We  are not  worried  about  losing  our  jobs.  You need our bodies.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Speaker,  I want  to  end by  saying that  at  the  heart  of  education  reform, education  investment,  which  should  be the  heart  of  this  year\u2019s  budget,  should be  $110  billion  over  a  10-year  period  for construction,  because  that  is  the  way we show our commitment for education as  we  go  into  the  21st  century  as  the leaders  of  the  world  and  as  the  leaders on  this  whole  globe.  We  ought  to  take this  budget  seriously.  We  ought  to make  the  decisions  that  will  carry  our Nation  forward,  and  not  make  the error  that  the  Romans,  Greeks,  and Egyptians made when  they were  at  the pinnacle  of  power  and  had  the world  in their hands. f REPORT  ON  RESOLUTION  PROVIDING  FOR  CONSIDERATION  OF H.R.  6,  MARRIAGE  TAX  PENALTY RELIEF  ACT  OF  2000 Mr.  DREIER  (during  the  special order  of  Mr.  OWENS),  from  the  Committee  on  Rules,  submitted  a  privileged  report  (Rept.

Under  a  previous  order  of  the the  GREEN)  gentleman  from  Wisconsin is  recognized  for  5  minHouse,  (Mr.  utes. Mr. GREEN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  bring  to  your  attention  a  very  important  issue  facing  the American  public,  something  that  we dealt  with  today  in  the  Committee  on the  Budget  and  something  I  talked about with the constituents I represent in  the  First  Congressional  District  of Wisconsin  throughout  the  past  2 months  during  the  Christmas  recess, and  that  is  this:  What  are  we  going  to do  about  our  Social  Security  surplus, what are we going to do about our nonSocial  Security  surplus,  and  what  are we  going  to  do  about  our  national debt?  These  are  the  issues  that  are driving  our  Federal  budget  process now. In doing so, the President, as he is required  by  the  Constitution,  sent  the budget that he is proposing to pass into law to Congress yesterday. This morning we had a hearing in the Committee  on  the  Budget  where  the President\u2019s  budget  director  outlined the  budget.  I  would  like  to  share  a  few of those details with the viewing public tonight and my colleagues. First,  we  finally  have  agreement,  we have  progress  on  the  fact  that  all  Social  Security  money  should  go  to  Social  Security  in  paying  off  the  debt  we owe to the program. If  you  recall,  Mr.  Speaker,  last  year in  this  well,  before  the  Nation  and  before  Congress,  the  President  in  his State  of  the  Union  address  said  he wanted  to  dedicate  62  percent  of  the Social  Security  trust  fund  to  Social Security,  thereby  spending  38  percent on other government programs. Last  year  this  Congress  said  no,  that is  not  enough.  I  actually  authored  the Social  Security  lockbox  bill  with  the gentleman  from  Ohio  (Mr.  which  requires  that  from  now  on,  if you  are  going  to  pay  Social  Security taxes,  it  goes  to  Social  Security;  that 100 percent of the Social Security taxes we  pay,  100  percent  of  the  Social  Security  surpluses  actually  go  to  the  program,  go  to  the  trust  fund  and  go  to pay off our national debt so we can create  more  solvency  in  the  Social  Security trust fund. So  there  was  a  difference  last  year. Congress was for protecting 100 percent of  the  Social  Security  trust  fund  last year;  the  President  was  for  protecting 62  percent  of  the  Social  Security  trust fund. Now  we  have  good  news.  The  President  has  finally  come  around  and agreed  that,  finally,  for  the  first  time in  30  years,  we  should  pass  legislation to  protect  100  percent  of  the Social Security  trust  fund.  I  am  very  encouraged by this news. However,  I  am  a  little  concerned  at what  Jack Lew,  the OMB Director,  the President\u2019s  chief  budget  writer,  said this  morning,  and  that  was  this:  They support  the  idea  of  putting  100  percent of  the  Social  Security  surpluses  back into Social Security and paying off our debt, but they are not in support of legKASICH) islation  to  ensure  that  this  happens. That is a little odd, I think. So I would like  to  see  this  administration  walk the walk and not just talk the talk. But  then what happens when we  look at  the  non-Social  Security  surpluses? Today  in  America  people  are  overpaying  their  taxes.  They  are  overpaying  their  taxes  in  two  very  fundamental  ways:  They  are  overpaying their  taxes  with  Social  Security  taxes. That  spending  of  the  surplus  has  occurred  for  years.  We  have  actually raided  that  fund  for  30  years,  this  government has, to spend on other government programs. For  the  first  time  in  30  years,  last year  this  Congress  stopped  the  raid  on the  Social  Security  trust  fund.  I  am seeking  to  pass  our  lockbox  legislation which will make sure we never go back to  the  days  of  raiding  the  Social  Security trust fund. But  on  the  other  side  of  the  Federal Government  ledger  book,  the  non-Social  Security  part,  millions  of  American  taxpayers,  hard-working  families, are  overpaying  their  income  taxes.  So we now have a non-Social Security surplus  approaching  $2  trillion  over  the next 10 years. That is astounding. We  were  looking  at  deficits  as  far  as the  eye  could  see  just  a  few  years  ago. Now  we  have  the  opportunity,  now  we have  the  good  fortune,  based  on  good discipline  in  spending  and  based  on  a great  economy,  to  have  a  $4  trillion surplus;  $2  trillion  for  Social  Security, $2  trillion  from  an  overpayment  of  income taxes. Here  is  what  the  President  is  proposing  to  do.  He  is  finally  agreeing with  Congress  that we  take  the  $2  trillion  from  the  Social  Security  surplus and apply that back to Social Security, towards  shoring  up  the  program  and paying  off  our  National  debt,  which consequently  is  some  money  we  owe back to Social Security. But on this non-Social Security part, the  income  tax  overpayment,  the President in this budget is proposing to spend $1.3 trillion of that surplus. He is proposing  to  spend  70  percent  of  the non-Social  Security  surplus  on  new government programs in Washington. Specifically,  as  we  analyzed  this budget in the Committee on the Budget as  we  did  so  this  morning,  the  President  is  calling  forth  creation  of  84  new Federal  spending  programs  to  be launched  this year by  the Federal Government,  to  be  paid  for  by  the  income tax overpayments of the American taxpayer. Now,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  held  over  60 town  hall  meetings  in  the  district  I serve  in  southern  Wisconsin,  the  First Congressional District, where  I  posed  a lot  of  questions  to  my  constituents  to ask  them  about  this.  They  said  that  if they are given a choice between tax reduction  and  debt  reduction  with  this money,  they  were  evenly  split.  But  if they  were  given  a  choice  between spending  their  income  tax  overpayments  on  new  spending  in  Washington or  reducing  our  national  debt  further VerDate 27-JAN-2000 02:23 Feb 09, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K08FE7.073 pfrm02 PsN: H08PT1 ",

We  have  had  a  good  amount  of  time spent on this  legislation on the  floor of the  Senate,  having  passed  it  once  before. A lot of work has gone into it this year.  I  believe we  are within  the  realm of  being  able  to  get  an  agreement which  would  allow  this  legislation  to move  forward  and  be  completed  in  a very fair way this week. I  also  extend  my  appreciation  to  the Democratic whip, Senator REID,  for his diligence  and  for  his  work.  He  has  always  made  an  extra  effort  to  make sure  we  are  communicating  and  there are  not  any  surprises  or  dilatory  actions  taken  as  we  try  to  come  to  an agreement  that  is  acceptable  to  the largest  number  of  people.  Senator of  Nevada  is  here.  This  is  very important to these two Senators and to their  State.  I  understand  that  and  I have  always  tried  to  be  sensitive,  understanding  their  need  to  offer  amendments  or  to  make  statements,  and  to be  very  careful  as we  consider  this  legislation. I thank them. I  understand  negotiations  underway  between  Senator  in  discussions  with  Senator  and  others,  but  I  do  think  we  need  to go  forward.  This  is  important  legislation.  I believe we are very close  to getting  an  agreement  that  is  going  to  be acceptable  to  a  large  number  of  Senators.  We  do  need  to  have  either  this agreement  worked  out  and  understood so  we  can move  forward  without  a  cloture vote or go ahead and go to cloture because  we  have  to  set  up  a  process that allows this to be considered, hopefully  favorably,  and  completed  this week.  We  have  been  working  on  it  a long  time  and now  is  the  time  to  begin to  close  the  deliberations  and  pass  this legislation. I  understand  Senator  has  been attending  a  hearing  and  is  on  his  way so we can proceed with this action. I do not  wish  to  proceed  without  his  presence  because  I  know  if  any  procedural action or any agreement is worked out, he  wants  to  be  here  and  be  a  part  of what  is  done.  I  do  say,  though,  I  do have  a  commitment  on  the  House  side I  am  going  to  have  to  attend.  I  was supposed  to  speak at  11 o\u2019clock,  so  I do need  to  go  to  the  House  to  carry  out my  commitment  as  soon  as  possible.  I will  withhold  any  formal  request  at this time, but by making this comment now  I hope maybe we can move expeditiously  to  call up  this bill and  to  filing cloture. I  have  one  final  comment.  I  say again,  as  I  have  said  several  times  in the  Senate  last  year  and  the  year  before  and  again  this  year,  this  is  one  of the  most  important  environmental bills we will have  in  this Congress. Billions of dollars have been  spent on  this issue,  and  an  inordinate  amount  of time  in  the  Senate,  trying  to  find  a way  to  get  it  done.  If  we  can  come  to an  agreement  and  get  this  legislation completed,  I  believe  history  will  look back  on  this  action  as  one  of  the most REID important  bills  we  will  have  done  this year.  If,  at  the  end  of  this  week,  we will  have  already  completed  the  final version  of  bankruptcy  legislation, which  included  a  minimum  wage  increase and tax relief for small businessmen  and  businesswomen,  and  address the  question  of  health  care  costs,  and then pass  this  important nuclear waste bill,  we  will  be  off  on  a  very  positive step.  It will be done  in a way  I think  is fair  to  both  sides  of  the  aisle.  We  can continue  to  make  progress.  As  soon  as Senator REID arrives, we will move forward  on  the  nuclear  waste  legislation. I observe the absence of a quorum. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The clerk will call the roll. The  legislative  clerk  call the roll. Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous  consent  that  the  order  for  the quorum call be rescinded. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr. ENZI).  Without  objection,  it  is  so  ordered. Mr.  LOTT.  I  thank  the  Senators  for being  here  as  we  prepare  to  move  forward  on  this  important  legislation.  I explained  what  has  been  occurring  and the need to move forward. proceeded  to f NUCLEAR  WASTE  POLICY AMENDMENTS  ACT  OF  1999 Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous  consent  that  the  Senate  proceed to  consider  S.  1287,  the  nuclear  waste bill. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  clerk will report the bill by title. The  legislative  clerk  read  as  follows: The A bill (S. 1287) to provide for the storage of spent nuclear  fuel pending  completion of  the nuclear  waste  repository,  and  for  other  purposes. Senate There  being  no  objection,  the  proceeded to consider the bill. Mr.  LOTT.  Mr.  President,  again, while  the  Senators  from  Nevada  are here, I have already noted my appreciation  for  the  cooperation  of  the  Senators from Nevada. We wanted to make sure  we  did  not  go  forward  without their presence. AMENDMENT NO. 2808 (To provide a complete substitute) the  Senator  Mr.  LOTT.  Mr.  President,  I  send  a manager\u2019s  amendment  to  the  desk. This was  circulated  to  the Members  on Friday.  I  know  there  are  others  who need  to  review  this.  I  hope  they  will take advantage of the opportunity they have to review it. Mr.  BRYAN.  Will  for a question? Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator. Mr.  BRYAN.  Mr.  President,  I  inquire of  the  distinguished  majority  leader, the  Friday  draft  is  the  one  from  which we  are  working.  There  have  been  so many. I just want to be sure. Is this the one marked February  4,  2000,  4:45  p.m.? Mr. LOTT. I believe it is. Mr.  BRYAN.  That  is  consistent  our  understanding.  I  thank  the  ator. with Senyield SPECTER Mr. REID.  If  I may  say  to  the  leader. Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator. Mr. REID. I say to the  leader and the chairman  of  the  full  committee  that  I am sorry I was  late, but we had a hearing  on  suicide  which  Senator  was  gracious  enough  to  hold.  I  was there because, as  the  leader knows, my dad  killed  himself  a  number  of  years ago.  It  was  a  very  emotional  hearing for me. I know it has been inconvenient for  Senator MURKOWSKI and  the  leader, Senator BRYAN, and others, but I do appreciate their understanding. The hearing  is  over,  so  I  can  give  my  full  time and  attention  to  this  matter.  I  appreciate  everyone  allowing  me  to  be  late. Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Nevada, we were aware of this  particular  hearing  and  how  important  and  emotional  it  was  for  him.  We have  to  be  prepared  to  yield  to  each other on occasion and be considerate of each other\u2019s needs. We certainly understand. I also appreciate his cooperation in moving forward. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  clerk will report the amendment. The  legislative  clerk  read  as  follows: The The  Senator  for  Mr.  numbered 2808.

You  can  have  accidents,  you can prevent them. We  have  a  pretty  good  record  here. Between  1971  and  1989,  the  Department of  Transportation  tells  us  there  have been  seven  minor  accidents  that  have occurred  involving  nuclear  waste,  but no  radioactivity was  released  at  any  of the  accident  sites  simply  because  of the  containment  of  the  vehicles  that enclose the waste. Those, of course, are the  canisters  which  are  built  to  withstand  exposure.  Some  time  ago  when we  were  talking  about  moving  nuclear waste  by  aircraft,  there  was  the  assurance  that  we  have  the  technology  to build  a  canister  that  would  survive  a free-fall  from  an  aircraft  at  30,000  feet. As  evidence  of  the  thousands  of  safe used-fuel  shipments  since  1964,  this  is the  type  of  cask  that  is  used,  and  the waste  is  stored  in  that.  These  are  required  to  survive  a  30-foot  drop  onto  a flat,  unyielding  surface,  a  drop  of  40 inches  on  a  steel  plate,  being  engulfed in  a  1,475-degree  fire  for  30  minutes, submersion  under  3  feet  of  water  for  8 hours,  and  on  and  on.  We  have  taken safeguards  to  construct  these  casks  in such a way as to ensure there  is a minimum  of  risk  associated with  transportation. I have been to Great Britain, Sweden, and  I  have  seen  in  France  the  manner in  which  they  move  high-level  waste. They move  it  by  ship,  by  rail,  by  road, and  they  take  safeguards  to  ensure that it is properly contained. We  have  transportation  safety  concerns. We have provisions in this bill to deal with them.  It  involves the Department  of Energy  developing  comprehensive  shipping  and  transportation  plans under  the  same  guidelines  as  we  currently  move  the  WIPP.  That  is  the waste  isolation  project  in  New Mexico. These  are  the  same  guidelines  we  are going to be using to move this waste. We  have  been  moving  waste  to  New Mexico.  That  is  basically  low-level waste.  I  have  been  there  and  been  in the  salt  caverns and observed  the process  down  there.  There  is  great  care taken  to  ensure  there  is  no  exposure that  cannot  be  rectified  through  adequate engineering technology. The  used  fuel  is  going  to  have  to travel  as  designated  by  the  States, they  having  a  determination  of  what the  most  appropriate  route  is.  Clearly, the  material  has  to  move;  otherwise, you cannot get it out of the States\u2014280 sites  and  40  States\u2014and  you  cannot move  it  to  one  area  that  we  have predesignated,  which  is  Yucca  Mountain in Nevada. Then  we  are  going  to  have  training which  would  meet  Department  of Transportation  standards  so  that  we have people who are adequately trained to move  this waste  and  cover whatever emergency  response  readiness  is  necessary before the shipments begin. So  what  we  have  done\u2014perhaps  we can do more and perhaps we should and I  certainly  am  open  to  that\u2014is  taken every  precaution  to  try  to  ensure  the exposure is taken out of the process. Let  me  show  you  a  couple  other charts  that  I  think  are  relevant.  For those  of  you  who  missed  it,  this  is  the location  out  in  the  Nevada  Test  Site that  has  been  chosen  to  be  the  permanent  repository.  This  site  has  been  already  pretty  well  bombarded  as  a  consequence  of  over  50  years  and  800  nuclear weapons tests. If you buy the theory  that  you  kind  of  desecrated  one area  so maybe  that  is  the  best  area  for a  permanent  repository,  this  site should certainly fit. Let  me  show  you  one  other  chart that  shows  another  aspect.  As  I  have indicated  earlier,  about  20  percent  of our  energy  comes  from  nuclear  power. You see on the chart, shown  in red, nuclear  power  accounts  for  18  percent  of our  energy  use  in  the  country.  In  any event, this chart shows the mix: Coal is 53  percent;  nuclear  is  18  to  20  percent; natural  gas  is  14  percent;  hydroelectric is  10 percent; other  is  2.7 percent; oil  is 2 percent; wind  is  .08 percent; and solar is .02 percent. It  is  obvious  we  are  going  to  be  dependent  on  these  sources  for  some time.  If  we  do  not  address  the  nuclear waste  issue,  we  are  going  to  pick  up  20 percent  of  our  power  generation  some other  way.  I  think  those  who  are  critical of the effort to address our responsibility  are  a  bit  irresponsible  in  not suggesting  where  we  are  going  to  pick up this differential. On  this  next  chart  we  look  at  air quality.  If we  look  at  our  concern  over global  warming,  if  we  look  at  our  concern  over  Kyoto,  we  have  to  recognize that  there  is  significant  avoidance  of emissions  by  the  contribution  of  nuclear power. You can  see  shown on  this chart  the  regions  that  were  subject  to caps  from  1990  to  1995  and  the  emissions  avoided  by  having  nuclear  generation  and  where  these  States  would be without it. It  is  a  pretty  tough  set  of  facts.  The reality  is,  a  good  portion  of  the Northeast  corridor  would  no  longer  meet  its mandate  for  emission  reductions  if,  indeed,  we  had  to  sacrifice  the  nuclear power industry. Approximately 80 of the 103 currently operating nuclear  energy  plants  are  located  in  or  adjacent  to  areas  that  are unable  to  meet  the  Clean  Air  Act standards  for  ozone.  Any  use  of  emitting  generation  in  these  areas  in  place of  the  existing  nuclear  capacity  moves the  region  further  away  from  attainment  of  these  standards.  So  I  encourage my colleagues from these States to recognize that the nuclear power industry  makes  a  significant  contribution, and  without  it  you  are  going  to  be looking  to  some  other  unidentifiable means  to  offset  the  loss  of  power  from the nuclear industry. Let me  turn  to  the  substitute  that  is before  us  and  briefly  reflect  on  where we  have  been.  We  have  passed  bills  in this body by a broad bipartisan margin. The  last  time  the  vote  was  65  to  34\u2014 pretty  close  to  overcoming  a  veto  but not quite. I  think  these  bills  pattern  of  trying  to  a  historic the  objecmark  meet  tives  of  the  administration  through compromise,  through  changes,  and through  accommodations.  Those  bills were  a  complete  substitute  for  the  existing Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 that gave authority to build an interim storage  facility  for  nuclear  waste,  a temporary  above-ground  storage  pad adjacent to the Yucca Mountain site. It contained  extensive  provisions  on  licensing for Yucca Mountain and the interim  storage  facility,  including NEPA radiation  protection  standards  and transportation safety. But the administration  was  not  satisfied.  They  saw  fit to  veto  the  legislation  because  it  opposed the interim storage before the viability  assessment was made  about  the permanent repository. We  still  think  we  were  doing  the  responsible  thing  by  trying  to  address the  difficulty  of  those  plants  that were about out of  license  time and would either  have  to  shut  down  or  seek  additional  relief  under  State  licensing  by allowing them to move their waste and store  it  at  Yucca  Mountain  until  such time  as  a  permanent  repository  was completed. Obviously,  there  was  a  fear  from  Nevada  that  if  that  were  adopted,  the waste  would  end  up  in  Nevada.  Of course,  today  we  are  faced  with  the concerns  of  various  Governors  that  if we  adopt  the  take-title  issue,  and  title is  indeed  taken,  the  waste  will  go  into canisters  and  be  stored  onsite  in  those States,  the  Government  would  have title and the waste would still be in the States, that it would not move. The  point  is  that  we  are  either  committed  as  a  body  to  resolve  this  problem  and  get  on  with  addressing  the transportation  of  that  waste  to  a  permanent  repository,  or  we  are  going  to be  faced  with  the  reality  that  we  will simply put it off for another day, put it off for another administration. If we do that,  I  think  we  are  acting  irresponsibly. What we have attempted to do in this bill  is  a  different  approach  in  the manager\u2019s amendment.  It  is not a complete substitute  for  the  old  act.  It  is  a minimalist  approach.  It  does  not  contain  an  interim  storage  provision.  So we  responded  to  the  administration. We  responded  to  the  minority.  We  left that out. We said: It doesn\u2019t move until it is licensed. We  propose  to  do  two  major  things. We  propose  to  give  the  Department  of Energy  the  tools  it  needs  to  meet  its commitment  to move  the  spent  fuel  by opening  a  permanent  repository  at Yucca Mountain. Secondly, we think  it provides  fair  treatment  by  permitting utilities  to enter  into voluntary  settlements  with  those  who  have  fulfilled their end of the bargain by paying over some  $15  billion  which  the  ratepayers have paid over the contract. What  has  the  Department  of  Energy done?  It  left  them  holding  the  bag  because  the  Department  of  Energy  and the administration have not  seen  fit  to lift  the  terms of  the contractual agreement  to  take  the  waste.  So  the  manager\u2019s  amendment  to  S.  1287  clarifies ",
            "59": "February 8, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) S479 New  York  Times,  but  I  congratulate former  Secretary  Robert  Reich  for  a piece he wrote.  I have only had  it  summarized,  but  he  raises  questions  about this  budget  the  President  submitted. Without  having  even  read  the  piece,  I think I understand his framework. I  say  to  the  administration  and  to Democrats,  I  find  a  little  unbelievable, with  the  economy  booming  and  such flush  economic  times,  when  one  actually  looks  ahead  over  the  next  decade, the nonmilitary discretionary spending and  where  we  are  going  to  be  making cuts.  I  hear  the  Democrats  talking about  how we will  reduce  the  debt,  but I  hear  precious  little  about  the  investment. What  I  worry  about  is  a  disconnect between  the  words  we  speak  and  the budgets we  present.  The  President  said he  had  a  budget  that  was  all  about making sure there would be health care coverage  for  every  citizen,  that  he  had a  budget  which  would  be  about  ending child poverty in America, that he had a budget  which  would  be  about  making sure  every  child would  come  to kindergarten  ready  and  able  to  learn,  that  he had  a  budget  which  would  provide  economic  security  for  senior  citizens.  But looking at the investment in this budget,  it  is  not  there.  I  worry  about  that. I  think  one  of  the  reasons  people  become  disillusioned  is  that  they  think they  will  make  a  difference.  I  gave  an example  today  at  our  luncheon  meeting.  My  parents  both  had  Parkinson\u2019s disease.  We  hear  discussion  that  there will  be  economic  security  for  senior citizens, there will be a commitment to long-term  care,  and  then  we  see  a  tax credit  that  amounts  to  a  particular amount  of  money;  maybe  for  an  individual  family  it would  be  $2,000  a  year. For a  family  faced with  long-term  care needs,  trying  to  figure  out  a  way  of staying  at  home  and  to  have  people help  one  stay  at  home,  $2,000  a  year  is not  going  to  do  it.  It  is  not  going  to even come close. I  am  troubled  sometimes  to  hear  my Senate colleagues, whom  I  love,  taking the  position  that  discretionary  spending  is  actually  staying  below  the  cost of  living.  We  are  really  keeping  it down. We are adding no new dollars. But  why  is  that  good  if,  in  the  first place,  some  of  our  spending\u2014I  will  say that, or  investment\u2014is  inadequate? We should  be  a major  player  in  pre-K,  prekindergarten.  That  is  where  the  Federal  Government  can make  the  biggest difference,  getting  the  money  and  the resources down to the communities and neighborhoods  so  we  can  make  a  commitment  to  early  childhood  development,  so  we  can  make  sure  the  men and  women  who  want  to  work  in  this field  are  professionals  who  get  decent salaries,  rather  than  getting  paid  $7  an hour  with  no  health  care  benefits; making  sure  families  can  afford  this  if both  parents  work  or  a  single  parent works;  making  sure  this  child  care  is not  custodial  but  it  is  developmental and  really helps  children. We  are  going to have to spend a lot of money. It cannot be done on the cheap. We  are  going  to  have  to  dig  into  our pockets and make an  investment. With all  due  respect,  I  appreciate  some money  for  refundable  child  care  tax credits,  but when  I  look  at  this  overall budget,  the  investment  is  not  there.  I am  glad  we  are  putting  more  money into Head Start, but we are not putting in  anywhere  near  enough  money  to make  sure  every  child  who  could  benefit  from  Head  Start  will  be  able  to benefit.  We  are  certainly  not  putting the  investment  into  affordable  child care. I would argue the most important national goal  for our country would be to make  sure  all  children\u2014no  matter  income  or  color  of  skin  or  rural  or urban or  boy  or  girl,  by  the  time  they  go  to kindergarten,  through  a  combination of  public  sector  investment,  private sector help, volunteers\u2014have been read to  widely,  all  these  children  know  the alphabet  and  know  colors  and  shapes and  sizes,  and  they  know  how  to  spell their  name  and  they  have  been  challenged  and  there  have  been  people  to nurture them and to support them. We are not doing that. So I say to the Chair\u2014he  is  a  Republican\u2014I  am  actually  being  more  critical  of  Democrats. I  am  starting  to  think  the  policy  debate  goes  like  this.  Republicans  say when  it  comes  to  the  most  pressing issues  of  working  families\u2019  lives,  like affordable  child  care,  the  President says  we  want  health  care  coverage  for citizens\u2014but  this  budget  does  not  provide that. It does not take us anywhere near universal health care coverage. So Republicans  say  universal  health  care coverage,  affordable  child  care,  investment  in  children\u2014listen,  when  it comes to these  issues, there  is not that much  the  Government  can  or  should do. I  understand  that.  That  is  a  legitimate  ideology  or  point  of  view.  Although,  frankly,  I  think  it  works  best for people who own their own large corporations  and  are  wealthy.  I  don\u2019t think  it  works  for  most  of  the  people. The  President  says:  No,  we  care about  children.  We  are  going  to  invest in  children.  We  are  going  to  have  universal  health  care  coverage.  We  are going  to  have  economic  security  for the  elderly. We  are  going  to make  sure no  child  is  in  poverty.  But  then  what we  say  is:  But,  politically,  we  cannot make  the  investment  because  then  it will  look  as  if  we  are  spending  too much.  In  which  case,  frankly,  the  differences  between  the  two  parties  don\u2019t make  a  heck  of  a  lot  of  difference  to  a lot of our most vulnerable citizens. So  I  wanted  to  come  to  the  floor, first of all, to congratulate former Secretary  Bob  Reich  for  raising  questions about  the  priorities  of  the  President\u2019s budget  and  all  the money  that  is  being put  into  debt  reduction.  You  can  and should  put  some  money  into  debt  reduction. But do you know what else? It would  seem  to  me  we  also  want  to make sure we do well for children right now.  In  the  next  century,  we  are  going to be asking them to carry an awful lot on  their  shoulders.  We  know  there  are a  lot  of  children  we  are  not  doing  very well by. My question is, in the words of Rabbi Hillel, his  third century admonition: \u2018\u2018If not now, when?\u2019\u2019 If  we  Democrats  do  not  start  speaking  up  for  children  and  talk  about  the need to invest in children and to invest in  pre-K  and  get  it  right  by  way  of  developmental  child  care\u2014which  should be huge,  it  should be all over  the country  and  there  should  be  resources\u2014if we do not speak up  for children, Democrats,  and  for  investment  in  early childhood education, then who will? \u2018\u2018If not now, when?\u2019\u2019 I think I have run out of time. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MURKOWSKI). The Senator from Nevada. f CAPITOL  HILL  POLICE  SECURITY Mr.  REID.  Before  the  Senator  from Minnesota  leaves  the  floor,  I  would like  to  have  a  brief  colloquy  with  the Senator. I  say  to  my  friend,  I  have  watched very  closely  your  public  statement  regarding  law  enforcement  on  Capitol Hill.  I  want  to  be  as  direct  and  forthright  as  I  can  be  in  underscoring  the work  you  have  done.  I  think  I  am  the only  U.S.  Senator  who  has  served  as  a Capitol  policeman.  I  worked,  when  I went  to  law  school,  on  the  night  shift and went  to  law  school  in  the daytime. I  think  I  have  some  familiarity  with what the Capitol Police go through. I  have  to  acknowledge  and  admit  the work  they  do  today,  compared  to when I was a Capitol policeman more than 30 years  ago,  is  much  more  dangerous, much  more  terrorist  threatened.  They face many more  dangers  than  I  have.  I said  on  many  occasions  the  most  dangerous  assignment  I  had  was  directing traffic.  But  the  fact  of  the matter  is,  I carried  a  gun  and  was  responsible  for maintaining  the  safety  and  security  of the  U.S.  Capitol.  I  am  very  proud  of that.  I  still  have  my  badge  that  I  carried.  I  still  have  that  in  my  office  in the Hart Building. The Senator  from Minnesota has  recognized  that  these  men  and  women work  in  harm\u2019s  way  every  day.  What the Senator  from Minnesota has  stated is when we  have  these  doors,  and  these men  and  women  are  there  alone,  it  is dangerous. Two of our law enforcement officers were killed as a  result of a  terrorist act, the act of a madman. I think the  people  who  maintain  the  Capitol Police  should  come  to  us. We  are  in  an appropriations cycle. If they need more money, let them tell us they need more money.  We  are  in  a  period  of  time where we need to get the real facts. I  say  also  to  my  friend  from  Minnesota,  I  am  very  concerned  we  have waited  all  these  many  years  and  we still do not have a visitors center. Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes. Mr.  REID.  We  have  taxpaying  people who come to the U.S. Capitol and spend hours standing in the cold and the heat waiting  to  get  in,  without  the  opportunity to use a bathroom. There are no ",

Furthermore,  I  will  continue to oppose any  future use of  these  funds by  the  Administration  for  anything other than their intended purpose. The  Administration\u2019s  new  initiative can work in tandem with the efforts focused  on  military  plutonium.  I  urge the  Administration  to make  quick  and quantifiable  progress  on  both  of  these fronts. The threat of proliferation from the Russian  nuclear  complex  continues to  grow.  And  it  continues  to  be  one  of the  greatest  threats  to  U.S.  security today. Mr.  President,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  this  New  York  Times  article be printed in the RECORD. There  being  no  objection,  the  article was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the RECORD, as follows: [From the New York Times, Feb. 7, 2000] TO U.S. FEARS MOSCOW TAKES STEP EASE PLUTONIUM USE ON (By Judith Miller) In  a  major  agreement  aimed  at  safeguarding  nuclear  fuel  that  could  be  used  to make  weapons,  Russia  has  promised  to  stop making  plutonium  out  of  fuel  from  its  civilian  power  reactors  as  part  of  a  $100  million joint  research  and  aid  package  from  the United  States,  Clinton  administration  and Russian officials say. While  the  administration  has  several  collaborative  programs  that  enhance  the  safety and  security  of  plutonium  produced  by  Russia\u2019s  military,  this  is  the  Energy  Department\u2019s  first  major  attempt  to  secure  Russia\u2019s  huge  civilian  stockpile  of  plutonium, from  which  3,000  nuclear  weapons  could  be made. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s  a  bold  initiative  to  reduce  a  30-ton plutonium  threat  from  Russia\u2019s  civilian  nuclear  sector,\u2019\u2019 Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson  said  in  a  telephone  interview. His  department  is to make public Russia\u2019s moratorium  on  plutonium  reprocessing  today  when it  unveils  its  budget  for  the  next  fiscal  year. Administration  officials  and  arms  control experts  were  particularly  pleased  with  the deal, more than a year  in the works, because it comes at a time of growing strains in relations  with  Russia  over  its  war  in  Chechnya, policy toward Iraq, and access to Russian nuclear facilities. The agreement is also likely to place added pressure on other nuclear powers  like Japan, Britain  and  France  to  follow  suit,  arms  control  experts  said.  Because  of  concerns  about the  environment  and  the  spread  of  nuclear materials  to  countries  like  Iran,  Iraq  and North  Korea,  the  United  States  has  not  reprocessed fuel since 1978. Part  of  the  accord\u2014$25  million  for  longterm  joint  research  that  is  most  attractive to  Russia\u2014is  contingent  on  an  end  to  new sales  and  transfers  of  nuclear  technology  to Iran.  Washington  believes  that  those  transactions  are  helping  Tehran  acquire  nuclear weapons. \u2018\u2018The money for this research will be in our budget,\u2019\u2019 said Ernest P. Moniz, the Undersecretary  of  Energy,  who  was  in  Moscow  last week  to  discuss  the  agreement.  \u2018\u2018It\u2019s  now  up to Russia to decide if they want it.\u2019\u2019 But  the  bulk  of  the money will  be  given  in exchange  for  Russia\u2019s  decision  to  halt  reprocessing  nuclear  fuel  from  its  29  civilian power  reactors.  That  will  include,  if  Congress  approves,  $45  million  to  better  secure spent  fuel  already  stored  at  Mayak,  a  once closed  nuclear  complex  in  the  southern Urals,  and  to  build  a  large  dry  storage  site elsewhere in Russia. Yevgeny  Adamov,  Russia\u2019s  atomic  energy minister,  insisted  in  a  telephone  interview he from  Moscow  that  despite  the  agreement, Russia would not  stop  competing  to  sell new lightwater power reactors to Iran. At the same time, he said, Russia has lived up  to  the  commitments made  to Washington last year not to provide sensitive material or technology  to  Iran.  But  it  was  willing  in principle  to  discuss  additional  safeguards and  \u2018\u2018more  commitments  for  greater  transparency to remove American concerns.\u2019\u2019 Mr.  Adamov  also  stressed  that  Russia  was not  abandoning  its  belief  that  plutonium, which  is  produced  by  all  nuclear  reactors, could eventually be used to fuel a generation of  \u2018\u2018safe\u2019\u2019  reactors,  not  yet  developed,  that would  produce  waste  more  difficult  to  recycle into weapons. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re  talking  in  terms  of  decades,\u2019\u2019  for the  moratorium  on  plutonium  reprocessing, he said. \u2018\u2018At least two may be enough.\u2019\u2019 Russia,  officials  said,  already  possesses about  150 metric  tons  of  plutonium  and  1,200 metric tons of highly enriched uranium, both of which can be used in nuclear weapons. Given  that,  said  Thomas  Graham  Jr.,  a former  arms  control  negotiator  who  now  is president  of  the  Lawyers  Alliance  for  World Security,  an  arms  control  group  in  Washington,  \u2018\u2018it  is  important  to  stop  the  accumulation  of  material  that  some  rogue  nations would love to get their hands on.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018This  is  a  very  important  agreement,\u2019\u2019  added. In  1998  alone,  Energy  Department  officials said,  Russia\u2019s  29  civilian  reactors  produced 798 metric  tons of  spent  fuel. Normally, Russia would send this material to Mayak for reprocessing\u2014that  is,  the  separation  of  plutonium,  which  can  be  used  in  weapons,  from the rest of the fuel. But  under  the  new  agreement,  the  plutonium  will  not  be  separated  out.  Instead,  the unreprocessed  material  will  be  stored  at  a new  site  somewhere  in  Russia  that  the United States will finance. The  location  and  ultimate  cost  of  the  site are  still  not  determined,  but  Mr.  Adamov said he was leaning toward Krasnoyarsk-26, a once  closed  nuclear  city  where  the  Russian military made plutonium. William C. Potter, the director of the Monterey  Institute\u2019s  Center  for  Nonproliferation Studies,  in  California,  particularly  praised an allocation of $3 million in the aid package aimed at helping Russia reacquire Soviet-era fuel  from  countries  like  Belarus,  Ukraine and Yugoslavia. He fears that the material is vulnerable to diversion or military use. Since  the  end  of  the  cold  war,  the  United States has spent billions of dollars to protect nuclear  materials  in  Russia  and  the  former Soviet Union  and  to  prevent  them  from  falling  into  the  hands  of  Iran,  Iraq  or  other  aspiring nuclear powers. As of this year, Washington  has  spent  about  $1.2  billion  to  help prevent  the  loss  or  theft  of  material  that could be used in nuclear weapons. At Mayak,  the  United  States  is  already  financing  the  construction  of  a  warehouse  to protect  bomb-grade  plutonium  extracted from  nuclear  warheads.  A  recent  American visitor  there  said  that  some  plutonium  was still  being  stored  in  milk-pail-size  canisters in  a  wooden  storage  shed  secured  mainly  by a padlock. Since 1993, Washington has bought 500 metric  tons  a  year  of  highly  enriched  uranium from  Russian  weapons,  sales  worth  more than  $400  million  a  year  to  Russia.  The  uranium,  which  is  blended  down  and  sold  as  reactor-grade  fuel  for  power  production, meets about  half  of  America\u2019s  nuclear  power  fuel requirements. The new aid package  for Russia would provide  $45  million  for  the  dry  storage  site  and security  upgrades  for  the  stockpiled  civilian plutonium  and  $30  million  for  new  efforts  to safeguard material  from  the military  sector. It  would  also  provide  $20  million  for  collaborative  research  into  devising  reactors and  fuel  that  cannot  be  used  to  make  weapons,  and  $5  million  for  research  into  the  design  and  development  of  a  permanent  geological  repository  to  store  used  fuel.  Administration  officials  stressed  that  only  those last  two  items,  which  are  longer-term projects,  hinge  on  an  end  to Russian  nuclear sales to Iran. Mr.  Adamov  said  on  Saturday  that  Washington  would  be  \u2018\u2018wrong\u2019\u2019  to  believe  that  a $100  million  assistance  package  would prompt  Russia  to  forgo  revenue  from  future reactor  sales,  each  of  which  could  be  worth up to $1 billion dollars. \u2018\u2018These  are  huge  orders  for  our  industry, and  we\u2019ll  aggressively  pursue  these  orders and win them,\u2019\u2019 he said. DOMENICI DOMENICI Mr.  LUGAR.  Mr.  President,  in  the fall of 1998 our majority leader named a bipartisan  group  of members  to  a Task Force  on  Plutonium  Disposition  to  advise the Senate and the Administration on  actions  with  respect  to  U.S.  policy and  approaches  to  bilateral  negotiations  with  Russia  on  the  disposition  of weapons-excess  plutonium.  I  was pleased  to  be  invited  to  join  the  group and  Senator  was  chosen  to chair the Task Force. Mr.  President,  Senator  has been  a  pioneer  in  the  area  of  nuclear weapons  material  safety,  security  and elimination.  He  has  spent  a  great  deal of  time  researching  this  initiative  and engaging our Russian colleagues on the issue.  He  was  instrumental  in  creating a  bilateral  dialogue  on  plutonium  disposition  that  led  to  the  protocol  on plutonium  disposition  signed  in  September  1998  at  the  Moscow  Summit. This  Protocol  has  led  to  ongoing  negotiations  to  finalize  a  bilateral  agreement  to  dispose  of  large  quantities  of weapons material. The  need  for  leadership  in  this  area was  clear.  Unclassified  sources  estimate  that  the  United  States  has  100 tons of plutonium and Russia has more than  160  tons  of  plutonium.  Most  of this  material  is  in  pit  form,  or  classified weapons shape. In other words, the material  could  easily  be  returned  to weapons  status.  The  U.S.  and  Russia have  each  declared  that  portions  of their  respective  stockpiles  are  surplus. This  material  represents  thousands  of nuclear  weapons  on  each  side,  including Russian weapons  that  until  a  short time ago were pointed at American cities. Mr.  President,  the  United  States  has been working with Russia  to dismantle their  nuclear  arsenal  through  the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction  program.  All  over  Russia  American  firms  are  cooperating  with  Russian  counterparts  in  deactivating  nuclear  warheads  and  dismantling  longrange  ballistic  missiles,  strategic  submarines and bombers. The U.S. secured Russian  agreement  to  remove  the  material  from  these  warheads  to  safe  and secure  storage  at  the  Fissile  Material Storage  Facility  under  construction  at Mayak,  Russia.  But,  the  U.S.  was  still left  with  the  challenge  of  how  to  get rid  of  the  plutonium,  to  ensure  that this material would never again threaten the American people. ",

It  brings  to  mind  the story of  the man who  is blessed  to be able  to speak  with  G-d,  and  in  awe  of  the  Lord\u2019s freedom from human constraints of time and space,  he  asks:  \u2018\u2018Lord,  what  is  a  second  like to you?\u2019\u2019 And  G-d  answers,  a thousand years.\u2019\u2019 The  man  then  asks,  penny like to you?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018To  me,\u2019\u2019  the  Lord  declares,  like a million dollars.\u2019\u2019 The  man  pauses,  thinks  for  a  then  asks,  \u2018\u2018Lord,  would  you  penny?\u2019\u2019 And G-d answers, \u2018\u2018I will. In a second.\u2019\u2019 I  am  honored  to  have  been  asked  to  speak to  you  this morning,  but  as  the  story  shows, I  proceed  with  a  profound  sense  of  my  own human limitations. I  want  to  begin  by  talking  with  you  about the  weekly  Senate  Prayer  Breakfasts\u2014those still-small  gatherings  that  have,  along  with their counterpart  in  the House,  spawned  this magnificent  National  Prayer  Breakfast  as well  as  similar  meetings  in  every  American state  and  so  many  countries  around  the world. When  I  was  first  invited  years  ago  to  the Senate Prayer Breakfast,  I  found a  lot of excuses not to go. Some were good\u2014like my reluctance  to  leave  my  family  so  early  on  a weekday  morning.  But  some  excuses  were not-so-good\u2014like  my  apprehension  that  the Senate  Prayer  Breakfast  was  really  a  Christian  breakfast  and  that,  because  I  am  Jewish,  I  might  feel  awkward  or  my  presence might  inhibit  my  Christian  friends  in  their expressions  of  faith.  I  was  wrong  on  both counts. The  regular  participants  in  the  breakfast, and  our  wonderful  chaplain,  Lloyd  Ogilvie, persisted  and  finally  convinced me  to  attend by  employing  a  tactic  that  usually  works with  us  politicians:  they  asked me  to  be  the speaker. That was  a  very  important morning  in my now  11  years  in  Washington.  We  began  with prayer  and  readings  from  the  bible  and  then called  on  the  chaplain,  who  told  us  about some  people  in  the  Senate  family  we  might want  to  pray  for,  because  they  were  ill  or had  lost  loved  ones.  Then  it  was  my  turn.  I spoke  about  the  Passover  holiday  and  answered  some  very  thoughtful  questions.  At the  end,  we  joined  hands  and  prayed  together. All  in  all,  it  lasted  less  than  an  hour,  but I  was  moved  that  morning.  More  than  that, I felt at home. Today,  I  can  tell  you  that  the  weekly Prayer  Breakfasts  have  become  the  time  in my hectic life in the Senate when I feel most at home, most tied to a community. Because we  are  at  those  breakfasts  not  as  Senators; not  as Republicans  or Democrats,  or  liberals or  conservatives;  not  even  particularly  as Christians  or  Jews. We  are  there  as men  and women  of  faith  linked  by  a  bond  that  transcends  all  the  other  descriptors  and  dividers\u2014our shared love of G-d and acceptance of His  Sovereignty  over  us,  and  our  common commitment  to  try  to  live  according  to  the universal moral laws of the Lord. I  pray  that  all  of  you  who  have  come  here this  morning  feel  those  same  unifying, humanizing, elevating sentiments. And I also pray,  as  we  begin  this  new  session  of  Congress,  that  your  presence  will  inspire  those of  us  who  are  privileged  to  serve  in  government  to  appreciate  the  truth  that  is  so  palpable  at  these  breakfasts:  What  unites  us  is much greater than what divides us. The  work  that  needs  to  be  done  for  the people  we  in  government  serve  will  best  be done  if  we  work  together,  and  we  will  work together  best  if  we  understand  that  we  are blessed  not  only  to  be  citizens  of  the  same beloved  country,  but  children  of  the  same awesome G-d. Praying  for  the  Lord\u2019s  guidance  and strength  as  we  begin  a  new  Congress  has been the traditional purpose of this National Prayer  Breakfast.  But  there  is  another  stated  aspiration  and  that  is  \u2018\u2018to  reaffirm  our faith and  renew  the dedication of our Nation and  ourselves  to  God  and  his  purposes.\u2019\u2019  I want  to  speak  with  you  about  that  second goal  this  morning  because  I  believe  it  is critically  important  at  this  moment  in  our national  history  when  our  economic  life  is thriving, but our moral life is stagnating. Although  so  much  is  so  good  in  our  country today,  there are other ways  in which we desperately  need  to  do  better.  There  is  compelling  evidence,  for  example,  that  our  culture has coarsened; that our standards of decency and  civility  have  eroded;  and  that  the  traditional sources of values in our society\u2014faith, family,  and  community\u2014are  in  a  life-anddeath  struggle  with  the  darker  forces  of  immorality, inhumanity, and greed. From  the  beginning  of  our  existence,  we Americans have known where to turn in such times  of moral  challenge.  \u2018\u2018Our  Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people,\u2019\u2019 John Adams wrote. George Washington warned  us  never  to  \u2018\u2018indulge  the  supposition that morality can be maintained without  religion.\u2019\u2019 That is why we pledge our allegiance to  \u2018\u2018one  nation  under  G-d.\u2019\u2019  And  why  faith has played such a central role in our nation\u2019s history.  Great  spiritual  awakenings  have brought  strength  and  purpose  to  the  American  experience.  In  the  18th  Century,  the first  Great  Awakening  put  America  on  the road  to  independence,  freedom, and equality. In  the  19th  Century,  the  Second  Awakening gave  birth  to  the  abolitionist  movement, which  removed  the  stain  of  slavery  from American  life  and  made  the  promise  of equality  more  real.  And  in  the  early  20th Century,  a  third  religious  awakening  led  to great  acts  of  justice  and  charity  toward  the poor  and  the  exploited,  which  expressed themselves ultimately  in  a  progressive  burst of social legislation. In  recent  years,  I  believe,  there  have  been clear  signs  of  a  new  American  spiritual awakening.  This  one  began  in  the  hearts  of millions of Americans who felt threatened by the  vulgarity  and  violence  in  our  society, and  turned  to  religion  as  the  best way  to  rebuild  a  wall  of  principle  and  purpose  around themselves  and  their  families.  Christians flocked  to  their  churches,  Jews  to  their  synagogues, Muslims to their Mosques, and Buddhists  and  Hindus  to  their  temples.  Others chose alternate spiritual movements as their way  to  values,  order,  and  peace  of  mind.  It has  been  as  if  millions  of  modern  men  and women were hearing the ancient voice of the prophet  Hosea  saying,  \u2018\u2018Thou  hast  stumbled in  thine  iniquity  .  .  .  Therefore,  turn  to  thy G-d . . . keep mercy and justice.\u2019\u2019 This  morning,  I  want  to  ask  all  who  are here  to  think  about  how  we  can  strengthen and  expand  the  current  spiritual  awakening so  it  not  only  inspires  us  individually  and within  our  separate  faith  communities,  but also  renews  and  elevates  the  moral  and  cultural life of our nation? Let  me  suggest  that  we  begin  by  talking more to each other about our beliefs and our values,  talking  in  the  spirit  of  this  prayer breakfast\u2014open,  generous,  and  mutually  respectful\u2014so  that  we  may  strengthen  each other  in  our  common  quest.  The  Catholic theologian, Michael Novak, has written wisely: \u2020 \u2018\u2018Americans  are  starved  for  good  conversations about  important matters of  the human spirit.  In  Victorian  England,  religious  devotion  was  not  a  forbidden  topic  of  conversathe  inhibitoday,  tion,  sex  was.  In  America  tions are reversed.\u2019\u2019 So  let  us  break  through  those  inhibitions to  talk  together,  study  together,  and  pray together, remembering the call in Chronicles to  \u2018\u2018give  thanks  to  G-d,  to  declare  His  name and make His acts known among the peoples .  .  .  to  sing  to Him  and  speak  of  all His wonders.\u2019\u2019 We  who  believe  and  observe  have  an  additional  opportunity  and  responsibility  to reach  out  to  those  who  may  neither  believe nor  observe,  to  reassure  them  that  we  share with  them  the  core  values  of  America,  that our  faith  is  not  inconsistent  with  their  freedom,  and  that  our  values  do not make us  intolerant of their differences. Discussion,  study,  and  prayer  are  only  the beginning,  because  we  know  that  in  the  end we  will  be  judged  by  our  behavior.  In  the Koran,  the  Prophet  says:  \u2018\u2018So  woe  to  the praying  ones  who  are  unmindful  of  their prayer\u2014and  refrain  from  acts  of  kindness.\u2019\u2019 Isaiah  summarizes  the  Torah  in  two  acts: \u2018\u2018Keep  justice  and  do  righteousness.\u2019\u2019  And the  Beatitudes  inspire  and  direct  us: \u2018\u2018Blessed  are  they  who  hunger  and  thirst after  righteousness  for  they  shall  be  filled; blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall  see  G-d.  Blessed  are  the  peacemakers for  they  will  be  called  the  children  of  G-d.\u2019\u2019 Turning  faith  into  action  is  particularly appropriate  in  this  millennial  year,  whose significance  will  be  determined  not  by  turning a page on our calendars at home or work, but  by  turning  a  page  on  the  calendar  of  our hearts and deeds. To make a difference, we must take our religious  beliefs  and  values\u2014our  sense  of  justice, of  right and wrong\u2014into America\u2019s cultural and communal life. In  fact,  that  has  begun  to  happen.  In  our nation\u2019s public places,  including our  schools, people  are  finding  constitutional  ways  to honor  and  express  faith  in  G-d.  In  the  entertainment industry, a surge of persistent public  pressure\u2014a  revolt  of  the  revolted\u2014has prodded at least some executives to acknowledge  their  civic  and  moral  responsibility  to our  society  and  our  children.  It\u2019s  even  happening  in  government,  where  we  have  come together  in  recent  years  under  President Clinton\u2019s  leadership  to  embrace  some  of  our best  values  by  enacting  new  laws  and  programs  that  help  the  poor  by  reforming  welfare, that protect the innocent by combating crime, and that restore responsibility by balancing our budget. In  communities  across  America,  people  of faith are working to repair some of the worst effects  of  our  damaged  moral  and  cultural life,  like  teenage  pregnancy,  family  disintegration,  drug  dependency,  and  homelessness. Charitable  giving  is  up,  more  of  the  young are  turning  to  community  service,  and  because our economy  is booming, or perhaps  in spite of it, people are finding they need more than  material  wealth  to  achieve  happiness. They want spiritual fulfillment, cultural elevation,  more  time  with  their  families,  and more  confidence  that  they  are making  a  difference for the better. So  there  is  reason  in  this  millennial  year to go forward from this 48th National Prayer Breakfast with hope, ready to serve God with gladness  by  transforming  these  good  beginnings  into  America\u2019s  next  Great  Spiritual Awakening\u2014one  that  will  secure  the  moral future of our nation and  raise up  the quality of life of all our people. \u2018\u2018Let your light shine before others,\u2019\u2019 Jesus said,  \u2018\u2018so  that  they may  see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.\u2019\u2019 If  we  do,  then  in  time,  as  Isaiah  prophesied:  \u2018\u2018Every  valley  will  be  exalted,  and every  mountain  and  hill  will  be  made  low.

JULIAN  C.  DIXON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 8, 2000 Mr.  DIXON. Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  pay tribute  to  Earl  Lester  Cole,  one  of  the  great pioneers  whose  exemplary  years  of  service  as an  educator  at  Grambling  State  University spanned  nearly  half  a  century.  Earl  Lester Cole\u2019s  tenure  at  Grambling  began  in  1936  as a  science  teacher;  advancing  through  the ranks  of  the  faculty,  becoming  dean  in  1946 and was appointed  vice president  in 1969. \u2018\u2018Dean  Cole\u2019\u2019  as  he  was  affectionately  called even  after  assuming  the  vice  presidency,  can be  remembered  for  his  active  involvement  in implementing  curriculum  which  is  considered to  be  the  cornerstone  to  courses  now  being offered  at  Grambling  State  University.  Even after  his  retirement  in  1977,  Earl  Lester  Cole continued  to  advise  members  of  the  faculty and administrators. Mr.  Cole  was  highly  respected  by  his  former colleagues  and  students  and  is  described  as  a true  professional,  a  good  administrator,  and  a truly  outstanding  man  who  is  credited  for  the positive  influence  in  the  educational  advancement  of  his  former  students.  Honesty  and  a fullness  of  integrity  were  accolades  from  those who  knew  him  well.  Over  the  years,  he  had been  recognized  for  his  numerous  contributions  to  Grambling,  culminating  10  years  ago in  the  naming  of  the  university\u2019s  honors  college,  the Earl Lester Cole Honors College. His  influential  involvement  in  the  community brought  several  businesses  to  the  university and  as  an  active  member  of  New  Rocky  Valley  Baptist  Church,  \u2018\u2018Dean  Cole\u2019\u2019  was  instrumental  in  the  construction  of  a  building  for  the church. Mr.  Speaker,  Earl  Lester  Cole  recently  succumbed  after  a  prolonged  illness  at  the  age  of 89.  He  can  be  remembered  as  a  man  who gave  much  to  the  field  of  higher  education  at a  historically  black  university,  always  exuded  a commanding  presence  during  his  lifetime.  In his passing  \u2018\u2018Dean Cole\u2019\u2019 will be deeply missed by  his  family,  colleagues  and  friends.  Our heartfelt  sympathy  to  his  wife, Garnett,  his  two children,  and  Elouise  Martin,  his  sister-in-law. f MARTIN  BANDA HON.  SOLOMON  P.  ORTIZ OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 8, 2000 Mr.  ORTIZ.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask  my  colleagues  to  join  me  in  commending  an  outstanding  young  man  from  my  district  in  South Texas,  Martin  Banda,  who  was  the  Southwest Region  Youth  of  the  Year  in  1999  as  part  of the  Boys  and  Girls  Clubs  of  America  and  the National  Youth  of  the  Year  Program.  They only  choose  five  winners  nationally,  so  this was an enormous honor. Martin  Banda  is  an  11-year  member  of  the Boys  and  Girls  Club  of  Harlingen,  Texas.  The circumstances  of  Martin\u2019s  life  are  the  sort  that would  make  many  people  lose  hope.  Growing up  in  the  Lemoyne Gardens  housing  project  in Harlingen,  Martin  could  easily  have  chosen  an easy but dangerous  life on  the  streets. But  a  higher  power  led  Martin  to  join  the Boys  and  Girls  Club.  He  thanks  the  Lord  for guiding  him  to  the  Club  because  it  is  a  safe sanctuary  from  the  street.  But  Martin\u2019s  obstacles  were  not  just  on  the  streets.  His  father was  incarcerated  when  Martin  was  just  5 years  old,  quickly  making  Martin  the  man  of the  house.  This  responsible  young  man  took care  of  his  mother  and  two  sisters  by  disciplining  himself  and  focusing  his  life  around positive  things. I  understand  the  trauma  with  losing  a  father early;  my  own  father  died  when  I  was  16, leaving  me  the  oldest  male  in  the  house.  But young  Martin  had  to  face  that  reality  and  responsibility  much  earlier  in  life  than  I  did,  and under  different  circumstances,  so  it  is  hard  to see  how  difficult  that  event  marked  his  young life. While  Martin  is  grateful  to  them,  the  Boys and  Girls  Club  and  Harlingen  are  grateful  to Martin  as  well.  Martin  is  a  role  model  for  the other  young  people  in  the  Boys  and  Girls Club.  He  has  great  athletic  ability,  having played  on  several  championship  football teams.  But  he  is  mostly  admired  for  his  strong leadership  skills,  developed  first  by  his  participation  in  the  Torch  Club  and  later  by  his  service  as  vice  president  of  the  Keystone  Club.  At last  count,  Martin  has  already  won  $29,000  in scholarships.  This  is  a  very  determined  young man  who  will  continue  his  education  on  his merit. Martin  is  a  senior  in  high  school  and  is  a member  of  the  National  Junior  Honor  Society with  a  3.75  GPA.  It  isn\u2019t  just  a  pleasure,  it  is an  honor,  for  me  to  represent  this  young  man in  Congress.  I  ask  my  colleagues  to  join  me today  in  commending  Martin  Banda,  the Southwest  Youth  of  the  Year  winner  for  his  triumph  over  the  odds  and  his  dedication  to  excellence. f PERSONAL  EXPLANATION HON.

EDOLPHUS  TOWNS OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 8, 2000 TOWNS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to the  unwavering  service  and  dedication Mr.  honor  of  the  administrators,  physicians,  nurses  and other  staff  of  Wyckoff  Heights  Medical  Center, a  renowned  350-bed  hospital  within  Brooklyn\u2019s 10th  Congressional  District.  For  over  100 years,  this  facility  has  served  the  residents  of Brooklyn with pride. I  also  ask  that  we  take  a  moment  out  of  our daily  business  to  commend  Wyckoff  for  its  extraordinary  work  throughout  the  years,  and  for going  that  extra  mile  this  month  by  sponsoring the  1st  annual  men\u2019s  health  symposium.  This symposium  entitled  \u2018\u2018The  First  Step  of  Empowerment  is  Taking  Care  of  Your  Health\u2019\u2019  will be  held  on  Monday,  February  14,  2000,  and will  take  the  extraordinary  step  of  focusing  on men\u2019s  health  in  Brooklyn,  and  throughout  this nation. Although  there  are  numerous  individuals who  have  worked  to  create  this  program,  I want  to  applaud  the  efforts  of  four  individuals: Dominick  Gio,  president  &  CEO;  Pradeep Chandra,  MD,  chairman,  Internal  Medicine; Nirmal  Matto,  MD,  senior  vice  president,  Medical  Affairs/director  of  Nephrology;  and  William Green,  vice  president,  Ambulatory  Services. They  each  have  worked  tirelessly  to  ensure that  Wyckoff  does  not  lose  the  focus  of  its mission:  to  provide  excellence  in  care  through prevention,  education  and  treatment.  In  today\u2019s  health  care  environment,  their  unwavering  energy  and  steadfast  determination  toward improving  our  health  care  delivery  system  is truly a beacon of hope  for  the  future. Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask  that  you  and  my  esteemed  colleagues  join me  in  commending  the work  of  Wyckoff  Heights  Medical  Center  and its  dedicated  staff.  It  is  truly  a  shining  star  in Brooklyn! f THE  STATE  CHILDREN\u2019S  INSURANCE  PROGRAM  RITY  ACT  OF  2000 HEALTH INTEGHON.

While  it  is  simply  a  technical  correction to  S\u2013CHIP,  it  is  important  technical  correction that  would  eliminate  a  very  real  potential  for conflict  of  interest  problems  caused  by  health plans playing dual  roles  in  state programs. The  need  for  this  legislation  was  first brought  to  our  attention  in  1998  when  California  initially  granted  a  contract  to  a  participating  health  plan  to  also  administer  the  state CHIP  plan.  In  fact,  that  health  plan  withdrew its  application  and  the  State  went  with  a  nonhealth plan alternative administrator. We  are  now  reintroducing  the  bill  and  urging its  swift  passage  because  it  may  soon  be  an issue  in  California  again  and  could  easily  become  an  issue  elsewhere  since  there  is  nothing  in  federal  law  that  prohibits  states  from to  introduce  the  State Insurance  Program  Integrity VerDate 27<JAN>2000 04:11 Feb 09, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\A08FE8.036 pfrm04 PsN: E08PT1 ",

ELEANOR  HOLMES  NORTON OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 8, 2000 Ms.  NORTON.  Mr.  Speaker,  today,  I  introduce  the  District  of  Columbia  Public  Safety Reimbursement  Act  of  2000.  The  bill  provides an annual  federal  contribution  to  reimburse  the District  for  the  considerable  services  the  Metropolitan  Police  Department  provides  every year  to  cover  the  many  national  events  and activities  that  occur  here  because  the  District is  the  national  seat  of  government.  Examples of  these  services  are  too  numerous  to  detail. Some  of  the  most  familiar  are  the  many events  and  demonstrations,  from  the  Million Man  March  to  the  federal  Millennium  event  at the  Lincoln Memorial  last month.  Events,  large and  small,  of  every  variety  occur  with  great frequency  and  cannot  proceed  without  the work  of  our  police  force.  The  MPD  is  at  the center,  from  the  extensive  logistical  preparations  to  the  on  duty  time  protective  services. The  bill  is  strongly  supported  by  D.C.  Police Chief  Charles  Ramsey,  who  joined  me  at  a press  conference  on  the  bill  here  in  the  Capitol earlier  today. The  annual  amount  provided  in  the  bill would  reimburse  the  District  for  the  considerable  services  the  Metropolitan  Police  Department  provides  every  year  to  cover  the  many national  events  and  activities  that  occur  here because  the  District  is  the  national  seat  of government.  Examples  of  these  services  are too  numerous  to  detail.  Some  of  the  most  familiar  are  the  many  events  and  demonstrations,  from  the  Million  Man  March  to  the  federal  Millennium  event  at  the  Lincoln  Memorial last  month.  Events,  large  and  small,  of  every variety  occur  with  great  frequency  and  cannot proceed  without  the  work  of  our  police  force. The  MPD  is  at  the  center,  from  the  extensive logistical  preparations  to  the  on  duty  time guarding and  facilitating  the event  itself. Further,  residents  see  our  police  every  time the  President  moves  outside  the  White  House complex  because  all  traffic  stops  while  our  police  line  the  streets  to  assure  the  President\u2019s safe  passage.  The  Congress  itself  frequently uses  our  police  department\u2014from  the  annual State  of  the  Union  address,  when  officials  and citizens  converge  on  the  Hill,  to  unusual events,  such  as  the  funeral  following  the  tragic killing  of  the  two  Capitol  Police  officers  almost two  years  ago. Cabinet  officials,  the  President, and Members  of  the House  and Senate,  not  to mention  other  federal  officials  and  agencies  all use  the  MPD  as  if  it  were  a  hometown  police force  they  had  bought  and  paid  for.  Actually they  pay  nothing.  In  countless  ways  on  a  daily basis,  federal  officials  and  tourists  alike  get excellent  D.C.  police  protection  free  of  charge. A  prominent  example  from  last  year  dramatically  points  up  how  the  cost  of  federal events  has  been  transferred  to  the  taxpayers of  the  District  of  Columbia.  A  ragtag  gang  of racists  and  anti-Semites  calling  themselves the  American  Nationalist  Party  came  to Washington  in  August  to  petition  their  federal  government  for  redress  of  their  grievances,  such as  they were. However,  it was  the District  government  that  picked  up  the  tab  to  the  tune  of a  half  million  dollars  for  police  protection.  At the  same  time,  pro-human  rights  groups  held a  large,  peaceful  rally  at  the  Lincoln  Memorial to  counter  the  Nazis.  Whether  marginal  and extreme,  like  the  Nazis,  or  mainstream  and pro-democracy  like  the  counter-rally  last  summer,  D.C.  police  participation  is  indispensable to  every  demonstration  and  national  event  that occurs  in  this  city.  The  right  to  assemble  is  a precious  constitutional  right available  to all and must  be  protected  for  all.  However,  those  who come  here  seek  the  attention  of  the  national government,  not  the D.C.  government,  and  the cost  should  be  borne  by  American  taxpayers, not D.C.  taxpayers. The  bill  I  introduced  today  places  financial responsibility  where  it  belongs.  There  are  two important  grounds  for  this  bill,  one  statutory and  the  other  historical  precedent.  The  statutory  basis  is  the  1997  Revitalization  Act, where  we  traded  the  federal  payment  for  a much  larger  federal  assumption  of  state  costs. However,  we  nevertheless  preserved  the  right of  the  District  to  receive  a  federal  contribution. We  wrote  language  into  the  Act  providing: \u2018\u2018The  unique  status  of  the  District  of  Columbia as  the  seat  of  the  government  . . .  imposes unusual  costs  and  requirements  which  are  not imposed  on  other  jurisdictions  and  many  of which  are  not  reimbursed  by  the  federal  government.\u2019\u2019  The  Revitalization  Act  (Section 11601)  therefore  allows  \u2018\u2018for  each  subsequent fiscal  year  [after  FY  1998],  such  amount  as may be necessary  for  such  contribution.\u2019\u2019 The  second  basis  for  a  designated  public safety  contribution  is historical precedent. Separate  from  the  annual  federal  payment,  the Congress  has  traditionally  appropriated  additional  funds  for  public  safety  purposes. Amounts  have  ranged  from  five  million  dollars VerDate 27<JAN>2000 04:11 Feb 09, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\A08FE8.060 pfrm04 PsN: E08PT1 "

Most  Americans  support  organ  donations.  Nonetheless,  only  about  50  percent  of  the  families  asked  to  donate  a loved  one\u2019s  organs  have  agreed  to  do so.  Americans  traditionally  have strong  values  and  share  the  spirit  of giving  within  ourselves,  within  our communities,  and  in  our  Nation.  Yet most Americans do not realize that the loss  of  one\u2019s  life  can  result  in  the  gift of life for many others. Our  corneas  could  give  sight  to  two people,  our  kidneys  could  free  up  two people  from  dialysis,  our  heart,  lungs, and  liver  can  literally  save  the  lives  of patients who are  in desperate need of a transplantation. There  is  no  greater  gift  than  the  gift of  life.  We  must  encourage  this  giving and  work  to  leave  a  lasting  legacy  to prevent  the  needless  and  tragic  deaths of thousands of Americans. f MARRIAGE  TAX  PENALTY The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Under the Speaker\u2019s announced policy of January  19,  1999,  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. WELLER)  is  recognized  during morning hour debates for 5 minutes. Mr.  WELLER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  have the  privilege  of  representing  the  south side  of  Chicago  and  the  south  suburbs in  Illinois;  and  I  am  often  asked  about a  fundamental  issue of  fairness, whether  I  am  at  the  steelworkers\u2019  hall  in Hegwish in the City of Chicago, or a legion  or  VFW  post  in  Joliet,  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  functions,  a  coffee shop  in  my  hometown  of  Morris,  or  at a grain  elevator, and  that  is  the  fundamental  issue  of  whether  or  not  it  is right  or  it  is  fair  that  under  our  Tax Code  25  million  married  working  couples on average pay $1,400 more in higher  taxes  just  because  they  are married. My  colleagues,  the  folks  back  home, whether  they  live  in  the  city,  the  suburbs,  or  the  country,  have  all  told  me that  they  think  it  is  just  wrong  that under  our  Tax  Code  25 million married working  couples  pay  on  average  $1,400 more  just  because  they  are  married. They  think  it  is  wrong,  and  they  want Congress and the President to do something about it. Let  me  introduce  Shad  and  Michelle Hallihan,  two  public  school  teachers from Joliet, Illinois. Shad and Michelle chose  to  get  married  a  couple  of  years ago.  They  just  had  a  little  baby,  just  a couple  of  months  ago.  But  Shad  and Michelle  are  a  typical  example  of  the 1.1 million Illinois married couples who suffer  the  marriage  tax  penalty.  Now, if  Shad  and  Michelle  stayed  single  and decided  just  to  live  together,  they would  avoid  the  marriage  tax  penalty because  the  marriage  tax  penalty  results  when  two  people  get  married  and they file jointly. So,  for  example,  Shad  and  Michelle have  identical  incomes  of  $31,000. Michelle  is  making  $31,000  a  year. Under  our  Tax  Code,  if  she  is  single, she  pays  at  a  15  percent  tax  bracket. But  when  she  and  Shad  chose  to  get married,  and  suppose  that  Shad  has  an identical  income  of  $31,000,  remember he  is  in  the  15  percent  tax  bracket  as well,  but  when  they  get  married  they file  jointly  and  their  combined  income pushes  them  into  the  28  percent  tax bracket.  So  they  are  now  paying  a  28 percent  tax  rate  on  that  same  income. Is  that  right?  Of  course  not.  It  is  time that  we  do  something  about  the  marriage tax penalty. I  am  proud  that  this  House  this  past week,  last Thursday,  voted  to wipe  out the marriage  tax  penalty with  the  passage  of  H.R.  6,  legislation  that  wipes out  essentially  the  marriage  tax  penalty  suffered  by  Shad  and  Michelle Hallihan  as  well  as  25  million  other married  working  couples  who  are  punished  just  for  getting  married  under our Tax Code. H.R.  6  passed  this  House  with  an overwhelming  bipartisan  vote.  Every House  Republican  and  48  Democrats bucked  their  leadership  and  voted  to wipe  out  the  marriage  tax  penalty  for 25  million  married  working  couples. That  is  a  big  momentum.  Of  course, our  hope  is  the  Senate  will  follow  our lead. One  thing  that  I  am  so  proud  of  our leader,  the  leader  of  this  House,  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HASTERT), the  House  Speaker,  I  thought  made  a very  smart  decision.  He  made  a  decision  to  allow  H.R.  6  to  come  to  the floor  as  a  stand-alone  bill,  a  bill  that only  deals  with  one  subject.  A  clean bill  that  wipes  out  the  marriage  tax penalty  and  that  is  all  it  does.  No  extraneous issues. Remember  when  the  President  and AL vetoed  our  effort  to  wipe  out the  marriage  tax  penalty  last  year?  It was  part  of  a  package,  tax-related  legislation. And,  unfortunately,  they  used the  other  provisions  as  an  excuse  to wipe  out  our  efforts  to  eliminate  the marriage tax penalty. My  colleagues,  we  have  a  great  opportunity.  And  my  hope  is  the  Senate will  follow  our  lead  and  move  quickly to  move  H.R.  6,  the  Marriage  Tax Elimination  Act,  through  the  Senate as  a  stand-alone  bill.  No  extraneous provisions,  no  riders,  no  poison  pills. We  need  to  keep  it  bipartisan.  Let  us keep partisan politics out of our efforts to wipe out the marriage tax penalty. Over  the  next  few  weeks,  25  million married working couples  like Shad and Michelle Hallihan  are  going  to  be  back home  watching  to  see  if  Congress  and the  President  do  something  about  the most  unfair  aspect  of  our  complicated Tax Code,  and  that  is  the marriage  tax penalty.  We  have  a  great  opportunity, and  it  is  all  about  fairness.  Is  it  right, is  it  fair  that  under  our  Tax  Code  25 million  married  working  couples  pay on  average  $1,400  more  just  because they  are  married?  Twenty-five  million couples  just  like  Shad  and  Michelle Hallihan. Let  us  wipe  out  penalty.  The  House  marriage  done  its  GORE the  has  tax job. My  hope  is  the  Senate  will  do  its  job, and my hope  is  the President will keep his  word.  Because,  remember,  in  his State  of  the  Union  address,  he  mentioned  the  marriage  tax  penalty  and the  need  to  do  something  about  it.  We have  an  opportunity. Let us keep  it  bipartisan,  let us  get  the  job  done,  let us bring fairness to the Tax Code and wipe out  the  marriage  tax  penalty  once  and for all. f RECESS The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.

Mr. LUCAS  of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker,  I  yield  myself  such  time  as  I  may consume. (Mr.  LUCAS  of  Oklahoma  asked  and was  given  permission  to  revise  and  extend his remarks.) Mr. LUCAS  of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with mixed emotions. It is  with  great  pride  and  honor  that  I support  awarding  Charles  M.  Schulz the  Congressional  Gold  Medal.  However,  as  we  all  know,  Mr.  Schulz,  the creator  of  the  beloved  comic  strip Peanuts,  died  last  Saturday,  February  12, at  his  home  in  Santa  Rosa,  California, at  the  age  of  77.  Therefore,  I  stand  before  my  colleagues  with  great  sadness. I  would  like  to  thank  the  gentleman from  California  (Mr.  for  introducing  this  most  appropriate  piece of  legislation.  Congress  has  commissioned  gold  medals  as  its  highest  expression  of  national  appreciation  for distinguished  achievements  and  contributions.  Without  a  doubt,  Mr. Schulz has earned this great honor. Mr.  Schulz  first  introduced  his  legendary  Peanuts  cartoon  to  us  in  October  of  1950.  It  was  then  that  the  world became  acquainted  with  such  characters as Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus and others. Like  millions  of  other  Americans,  I often  felt  as  though  I  knew  the  man personally,  having  read  and  watched his  cartoons  for  as  long  as  I  can  remember.  I believe  that  I knew  the man as only a  life-long  fan could know him, through  his  work.  I  am  extremely  appreciative  of  Mr.  Schulz  and  his  creation of the Peanut gang. For  almost  50  years,  he  provided  us with endless hours of humor, entertainment.  His  cartoons  and  characters  will live with us forever. Mr.  Speaker,  I  reserve  my time. Mr.  LAFALCE.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  support of H.R. 3642, introduced by the gentleman from California  (Mr.  a  bill  to award  a  gold  medal  to  a  man  who  was a  friend  to  the  entire  Nation,  Charles M. Schulz. Peanuts was both a national treasure  and  a  national  delight.  Every morning  for  almost  half  a  century, America  awoke  to  read  the  newspapers and  millions  of  eyes  turned  to  the pages  where  Charlie  Brown,  Lucy, Snoopy, and Linus lived. Yet,  it  was  not  only  Americans  who took in the bounty of the strip\u2019s tender THOMPSON),  balance  the  of humor  and  sage  advice. Worldwide,  the best  estimate  is  a  global  audience  of 355 million  fans.  They  were  in  75  countries,  read  in  2,600  newspapers,  and spoke 21 languages. Then  there  were  the  spin-offs.  Beginning  in  the  1960s,  a  Charlie  Brown Christmas;  It\u2019s  the  Great  Pumpkin, Charlie  Brown,  were  among  the  television  specials.  In  an  era  where  relentless  violence  is  the  main  fare  of  television  programming,  how  welcome  to find  true  amusement  in  good  taste, where  the  most  dangerous  party  is  either  a  girl  who  pulls  away  the  football just  before  the  kick  or  a  fantasy  Red Baron. There were songs and even a musical, You Are a Good Man, Charlie Brown. Peanuts  was  not  easy,  slapstick humor.  Long-time  readers  know  there was  real  substance  about  the  disappointments  in  life.  However,  it  was also  about  the  great  line,  Happiness  Is a  Warm  Puppy,  which  for  millions  of children  and  their  parents  had  that ring  about  what  truly  makes  life worthwhile. Most  in  this  chamber  will  be  surprised  that  the  spell  of  Peanuts  so  bedeviled  theologians,  philosophers,  and psychiatrists  that  weighty  books  and articles  were  written  probing  the  true meanings  of  the  comic  strip.  They  all found  something  of  great  worth,  sometimes  a  brooding worth,  all  of which  is fine. But for most of the adults we simply  reveled  in  how  four  or  five  small cartoon  frames  Schulz  could  pack  so much  humor,  joy,  sadness  and  irony, all  of  the  elements  of  great  expression. However,  the  whole  production  of Peanuts  cartoons,  films,  musicals, books and even the dolls had special allure  for  children.  Schulz  had  no  problem  communicating  across  many  generations  from  when  the  first  Peanut strip  appeared  half  a  century  ago.  I suspect  one  of  his  attractions  to  the young  was  that  he  was  so  easy  to  read and so direct. There was also Linus\u2019 security  blanket.  It  gave  the  young  the idea  that  through  it  all  there  are things, lasting things, to hold on to. The books were just great reading instructors  for  millions  of  children  that were  nonviolent,  but  not  just  a  bowl  of cheer. Mr.  Speaker,  for  years  now  I  have worn  about  three  different  Peanuts ties.  I wear  one  today.  I  do  not  think  I have  ever  worn  a  Peanuts  tie  when  it has  not  been  commented  upon  and  it has  not  lit  up  someone\u2019s  day.  It  is  almost  impossible  to  see  a  Peanuts  tie and  not  smile,  not  feel  some  warmth, some  empathy.  That  was  the  effect  of Charlie Schulz. We are all familiar with his fame, but I  would  like  also  to  remind  all  that Schulz  had  served  his  country  on  the battlefields  of  World  War  II.  He  never forgot  he  was  a  veteran,  and  served  as head  of  the  fund-raising  campaign  for the  National  D-Day  Memorial.  He  had the grit to be a good hockey player; the mathematical  skill  to  be  a  fine  bridge enthusiast;  and  the  devotion  it  takes goodBACH\u2018\u2018Thank  THOMPSON),  to teach Sunday school and deliver sermons. Rarely  can  a  man  be  called  a  global social  institution;  but  in  Charles  M. Schulz\u2019  case,  that  is  surely  just  what he  was  when  he  died  after  77  years  of phenomenal productivity and contribution. How it all came about will remain a  mystery.  A  personality  that  large  is never  a  simple  book,  but  this much  we know: in his life he did get to kick that football  over  the  goal  post.  His  work, with  all  its  substance  and  wit,  has  become  part  of  the  national  and  global fabric  and  will  be  with  us  for  a  long time. At  last,  one  can  say,  ness, Charlie Brown.\u2019\u2019 Mr. LAFALCE. Mr. Speaker,  I  yield  5 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  California  (Mr.  the  author  of the resolution. Mr.  THOMPSON  of  California.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman  from  Iowa  (Mr.  LEACH),  the gentleman  from  Alabama  (Mr.  US),  and  the  gentleman  from New York (Mr.  LAFALCE),  along  with  the  308  cosponsors  who  supported  this  legislation,  and  for  their  assistance  in  bringing  this  bill  to  the  floor  today.  It means a great deal to Mr. Schulz\u2019s family.  It means a great deal  to me, and  it means  a  great  deal  to  the  community that  I have the honor to represent that has  had  the  honor  to  share  that  community with Sparky Schulz. b 1200 I  would  also  like  to  thank  my  fornia  colleague,  Senator DIANNE STEIN, who has introduced the identical bill  in  the  Senate  to  make  sure  that this  gold  medal  does  come  to  fruition. Mr. Speaker, this bill before us today is not  about honoring  a  cartoonist who made  us  laugh  and  think  but,  rather, about  honoring  a  lifetime  of work  that has  transcended  generations  of  Americans  and  has  become  the  fabric  of  our national  culture.  We  have  adopted  his characters  as  our  own,  and  sometimes even  as  ourselves.  Through  them  he provided  us  a  uniquely  American  sense of optimism, purpose, and pride. While  many  other  pop  figures  reflect our  fantasies,  Sparky  Schulz\u2019s  characters,  like  Charlie  Brown,  reflected who  we  really  are.  Charles  Schulz  created  the  Peanuts  comic  strip  in  October  of  1950,  and  he  personally  drew every  single  daily  and  Sunday  strip. Peanuts  appeared  in  2,600  newspapers around  the  world  and  reached  approximately  355  million  readers  every  day, and they came in some 20 different languages. Sparky  Schulz  gave  us  more  than just  Peanuts.  Most  notable  was  his work  with  the  Regional  Organization Canine  Companion.  This  wonderful  organization  breeds,  raises,  trains,  and places  dogs  with  individuals  who  are limited  by  disabilities.  Along  with  his wife  Jeanne,  Sparky  led  and,  in  large part,  personally  financed  the  construction  and  the  operation  of  the  Canine Companion\u2019s  facility  in  Sonoma  County, California.

Mr.  Chairman,  H.R.  2086  is  a  bipartisan  bill  that  will  lead  to  many  societal  benefits.  It  will  help  ensure  that this Nation  continues  to maintain  economic  growth  and  international  competitiveness  in  the  information  economy  of  the  21st  century.  I  ask  for  the support  of  my  colleagues  for  the  passage of this bill. Mr.  Chairman,  of my time. Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield  3  minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Michigan  (Mr.  who  is  the  Chair  of  the  Committee  on Science\u2019s  Subcommittee  on  Basic  Research,  which  has  jurisdiction  over NSF. Mr.  SMITH  of  Michigan.  Mr.  Chairman,  first,  I  would  thank  the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Chairman SENand  the  gentleman  from Texas  (Mr.  HALL),  who  have  done  such great  service  to  further  the  efforts  of science  and  research  in  this  country.  I would  also  compliment  the  ranking member  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Basic Research, the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. EDDIE This legislation I think gives the emphasis  needed  to  move  us  ahead  in  information technology, and certainly we should  remind  ourselves  that  information  technology  research  has  been  instrumental in bringing about the information  revolution,  which  some  have compared  to  the  industrial  revolution in its size and in its scope. This  revolution  has  spawned  new businesses,  created  millions  of  good high-paying  jobs,  advanced  the sciences,  and  certainly  improved  the health  and  welfare  of  the  citizens  of the  country  and  people  all  over  the world. However,  as  the  President\u2019s  Information  Technology  Advisory  Committee recently noted, the current boom in information  technology  is  based  on  the basic research in computer science carried  out more  than  15  years  ago.  There is  an  urgent  need  to  replenish  the knowledge  base.  The  advisory  committee  advocated  a  5-year  initiative  to boost  basic  research  funding  significantly  and  help  maintain  the  Nation\u2019s lead in this critical area. This bill, H.R. 2086,  was  designed  to  carry  through  on PITAC\u2019s recommendations. In  testimony  before  the  Subcommittee on Basic Research last year, university  researchers  and  members  of the  private  sector  were  very  supportive.  Dr.  Lazowska,  a  professor  at the University of Washington and chair of  the  Computer  Research  Association, praised  this  bill,  saying  that  it  exemplifies  a  sound  approach  to  making  research  policy  by  responding  to  clear national needs with recognizable objectives  and  a  well-defined  program  for meeting those objectives. b 1330 In  addition,  Dr.  Roberta  Katz,  president  and  CEO  of  the  Technology  Network,  noted  favorably  that  the  5-year authorizations  in  the  bill  demonstrate a  commitment  to  a  continued  strong Federal  investment  in  basic  IT  research to move information technology ahead. In  today\u2019s  fast-paced  science  and technology  environment,  resting  on our  past  successes  is  not  enough  if  we are  going  to  keep  ahead  in  a  world where  other  countries  are  dedicated  to matching  our  productivity  and  taking away our customers. H.R. 2086 will help ensure  that  America  stays  at  the  cutting  edge  of  new  information  technologies  that  will  stimulate  economic growth,  improve  our  lives,  and  push forward the frontiers of science. I  am  pleased  to  have  been  a  cosponsor  of  this  bill,  because  it  is  this  kind of  initiative  that  is  going  to  help  assure  a  good  future  for  the  citizens  of the United States. Mr.  HALL  of  Texas.  Mr.  Chairman,  I yield  6  minutes  to  the  gentlewoman from  Texas  (Ms.  BERNICE EDDIE JOHNSON). Ms.  EDDIE  BERNICE  JOHNSON  of Texas.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  in  support of  H.R.  2086.  The  bill  authorizes  a major  new  research  investment  in  information  technology,  which  is  consistent  with  the  President\u2019s  information  technology  for  the  21st  century initiative.  This  research  initiative  is very  important  to  the  Nation\u2019s  future and  its  well-being,  and  I  am  pleased that  the  measure  has  now  come  before the  House  for  its  consideration;  and  I give  my  thanks  and  respect  to  the chairman, and the chairman of the subcommittee  and  the  ranking  member  of the committee. Information  technology  is  a  major driver  of  economic  growth.  It  creates high-wage  jobs, provides  for  rapid communication  throughout  the  world,  and provides  the  tools  for  acquiring  knowledge and  insight  from  information. Advances  in  computering  and  communications  will  make  the  workplace more  productive,  improve  the  quality of  health  care,  and  make  government more  responsive  and  accessible  to  the needs of our citizens. Vigorous long-term research is essential  for  realizing  the potential of  information  technology.  The  technical  advances  that  led  to  today\u2019s  computers and the  Internet evolved  from past  federally  sponsored  research,  in  partnership with industry and universities. H.R. 2086 will ensure that the store of basic  knowledge  is  replenished  and thereby  enable  the  development  of  future  generations  of  information-technology products and services. H.R.  2086  has  received  the  bipartisan cosponsorship  of  many  Members,  and  I would  like  to  acknowledge  the  collegial  manner  in  which  the  bill  was  developed  by  the  Committee  on  Science. I  want  to  thank  the  chairman  of  the committee,  the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER), for his efforts  in  crafting  the  bill  and  further thank  the  chairman,  and  the  ranking Democratic  Member,  the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. HALL), for their efforts in moving the bill to the floor. H.R.  2086  will  establish  a  multiagency  research  initiative  that  responds  to  the  recent  findings  and  recommendations  of  the President\u2019s  information-technology  advisory  committee.  This  committee,  which  was  established  through  statute,  is  composed of  distinguished  representatives  from computer  and  communication  companies  and  from  academia.  It  reached  its conclusions  following  a  comprehensive assessment  of  current  federally  funded information-technology research. The  President\u2019s  advisory  committee found  that  Federal  funding  for  information-technology  research  has  tilted too  much  toward  support  for  nearterm,  mission-focused  objectives.  They discovered  a  growing  gap  between  the power  of  high  performance  computers available to support agency mission requirements  versus  support  for  the  general  academic  research  community. They  identified  the  need  for  socioeconomic research on the impact on society of the rapid evolution of information  technology,  and  they  judged  that the  annual  Federal  research  investment is inadequate by more than $1 billion. I  believe  that  H.R.  2086,  as  reported from  the  Committee  on  Science,  addresses  each  of  the  deficiencies  identified  by  the  advisory  committee  and will  effectively  implement  its  recommendations.  I  am  particularly pleased  by  the  inclusion  of  a  provision that  I  offered  in  committee  to  explicitly  authorize  research  to  identify,  understand,  anticipate,  and  address  the potential  social  and  economic  cost  and benefits  from the  increasing pace of  information  technology-based  transformations. In  addition  to  support  for  research, H.R.  2086  will  also  contribute  to  providing the highly trained workers needed by the information industry. My district knows about this all too well. The bill would  expand  the  human  resources pool  through  two  principal  mechanisms.  First,  as  a  part  of  their  training,  graduate  students  will  participate in  most  of  the  individual  research projects supported by the bill; and, secondly,  special  provision  is  made  for student  internships  in  industry  to  help recruit  individuals  for  careers  and  information-based companies. I  sponsored  the  provision  in  the  bill that  opened  such  internships  to  students participating in the Louis Stokes Alliances  for  Minority  Participation program  administered  by  the  National Science Foundation. Research  discoveries  in  information technology  over  the  past  30  years  have resulted in new commercial enterprises that now constitute a major fraction of the  economy.  Businesses  that  produce computers,  semiconductors,  software and  communications  equipment  have accounted  for  a  third  of  the  total growth  in  the  United  States  economic production since 1992. Clearly,  there  is  ample  the  value  of  past  Federal  evidence  of investments VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:54 Feb 16, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K15FE7.051 pfrm02 PsN: H15PT1 ",

When  I  was young,  I  traveled  around  the  country with my dad who was a topographic engineer with the USGS. Dad helped meet the  challenge  of  mapping  this  country by taking to the field with the old fashioned rod and compass in hand. Today,  the  topographic  maps  my  father helped create are digitized and the data  they  contain  augmented  by  readings  from  satellites,  sensors  buried  in the ground, and experiments run  in the lab.  Today,  the  current  shuttle  radar topography  mission  to  map  the  world is  in  its  5th  day  of  sending  back  billions of bytes of data. The  USGS  has  spent  the  last  121 years  building  a  collection  of  these maps,  images,  and  other  information assets  as  a  way  of  answering  some  of our  fundamental  questions  about  the Earth  and  its  processes.  These  assets now  include  extremely  large  data  sets requiring  extraordinary  technology challenges to maintain and use. That is why this amendment is important. It  is  difficult  to  get  a  grasp  on  the size  of  the  challenge  without  resorting to  an  analogy.  For  example,  the  USGS information  assets  include  petabyte size  data  sets.  A  petabyte  is  2  to  the 50th  power  bytes,  one  million gigabytes,  a  thousand  trillion  bytes,  a number  that  even  someone  used  to dealing  with  the  Federal  budget  has  a hard  time  understanding.  To  describe the  vastness  of  this  information  in  another  way,  these  databases  are  the equivalent  of  20  million  four-drawer legal-sized filing cabinets stuffed full of text.  The  computers  and  processors that  deal  with  these  data  sets  must  be correspondingly  capable  and  the  network  connections  that  feed  them  must be adequately quick. The  USGS  continues  to  research these  technologies  as  part  of  their  research  agenda.  Allowing  them  to  partner  in  the  research  funded  under  this bill  will  help  ensure  that  their  technology needs are met. It will also allow them  to  bring  their  considerable  skills to  the  table  and  help  focus  this  research  into  the  areas  where  it  is  sure to do the most good. I  should  point  out,  Mr.  Chairman, that  this  amendment  does  not  authorize any new funding. This simply recognizes  the USGS  in  its  role  as  a  participant  in  IT  research.  I  am  pleased  to offer  this  amendment  with  the  support of  the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin  (Mr. the  chairman  of  the Committee  on  Science  and  the  approval  of  the  gentleman  from  Alaska (Mr.  the  chairman  of  the  Committee  on  Resources  and  the  gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. CUBIN) the chairman  of  that  committee\u2019s  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources.

He  correctly  states  that  the  only  reason  this was  not  included  in  the  bill  when  it was  considered  by  the  Committee  on Science  is  that  it would  have  triggered a  sequential  referral  to  the  Committee on  Resources  which  would  have  resulted in a delay. I would like to thank the  gentleman  from  Alaska  (Mr. for  signing  off  on  this  amendment.  This  simply  integrates  the  efforts  of  the  U.S.  Geological  Service into  the  type  of  research  that  is  being done  so  that  their  mapping  efforts  can be  much  better  digitalized  and,  thus, much more effective. Mr.  SMITH  of  Michigan.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  conclude  by  requesting the  support  of  my  colleagues  in  the passage of this amendment. Mr.  HALL  of  Texas.  Mr.  Chairman,  I rise  in  support,  of  course,  of  this amendment  by  the  gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. SMITH).

Mrs.  MORELLA.  Mr.  Chairman,  H.R. 2086 will maintain our global leadership in  information  technology  and prioritize  our  Nation\u2019s  basic  IT  research  by  authorizing  funding  for  six agencies  that  are  undertaking  civilian IT  research  and  development  initiatives.  We  have  heard  a  lot  about  that. These  six  lead  agencies,  NSF,  NIST, NASA,  NOAA,  EPA  and  the  Department  of  Energy,  to  use  all  those  acronyms,  all  participate  in  programs  involved  with  high-performance  computing  and  communications  and  next generation  Internet  programs.  One major  agency,  however,  Mr.  Chairman, the  National  Institutes  of  Health,  is not  among  the  group  of  agencies  currently authorized in the bill. My  amendment  would  allow  NIH  to receive  the  funding  authorization  that it  needs  for  vital  information  technology resources needed to map out the human  genetic  map,  battle  cancer  and other  life-threatening  diseases,  provide bioinformatic  and  molecular  analysis, assist  with  telemedicine  and  advance computational  medicine,  among  other efforts. Mr.  Chairman,  let  me  provide  just one  example  of  the  importance  of  cutting  edge  information  technology  for today\u2019s  innovative  medical  research. The  human  genome  project,  overseen by NIH  and  the Department  of  Energy, is  an  international  research  program designed  to  construct  detailed  genetic maps  and  determine  the  complete  sequence  of  human  DNA  and  localize  the estimated  50,000  to  100,000  genes  within the human genome. Later this year, researchers will complete  the  first  draft  of  the  entire human  genome,  the  very  blueprint  of life.  It  is  clear  that  the  development and  use  of  this  genetic  knowledge  will have  momentous  implications  for  both individuals  and  society,  potentially opening  the  doors  to  breakthrough medical  discoveries  that  will  allow  all of  us  to  live  longer  and  improve  our human  condition.  At  the  very  heart  of the  human  genome  project  are  high speed,  high  performance  computers that  analyze  and  sequence  the  voluminous  information  collected  by  researchers.  As  more  information  is  collected,  these  cutting  edge  computers must  continually  be  advanced  and  upgraded  to  complete  the  job.  In  the  past 6  years,  Congress  has  made  a  priority of  NIH  research  funding.  Our  wise  investments  in  NIH  research  have  already  paved  the way  to  a  revolution  in our  ability  to  detect,  treat,  and  prevent  disease.  Yet  we  must  also  ensure that  the  NIH  is  provided  with  the  necessary  information  technology  funds that are needed to conduct  its very  important medical research. The  amendment  before  us  today would authorize  $233 million  in NIH  information technology funding for fiscal year  2001,  $242  million  in  fiscal  year 2002,  and  $250  million  in  fiscal  years 2003  and  2004.  This  funding  level  meets NIH\u2019s  budget  request  for  information technology  and  is  consistent  with  an NIH  letter  requesting  such  funding sent  to  the  gentleman  from  Virginia VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:23 Feb 16, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K15FE7.106 pfrm02 PsN: H15PT1 ",

The  Chair  recognizes  the  from Utah (Mr. HANSEN). Mr.  HANSEN.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  H.R.  149  is  a  noncontroversial bill that makes a number of  technical  corrections  to  the  Omnibus  Parks  and  Public  Lands  Management  Act  of  1996  and  to  other  laws  related  to parks and public  land management. Mr.  Speaker,  as  Members  are  aware, in  each  congressional  session  a  large number  of  individual  pieces  of  legislation  are  passed  and  written  into  law. Often  small  mistakes  and  errors  are made  in  drafting  and  printing  the  final language  that  becomes  the  actual  law. For  example,  the  wrong  number  of  a map  might  be  found,  a  period  is  missing  from  a  sentence,  or  a  word  is spelled incorrectly. The administration  is very proficient in discovering these technical mistakes and  have  brought many  of  them  to  the attention  of  Congress.  This  bill  makes numerous  technical  corrections  to  language  which  has  been  written  into many  of  our  various  laws,  and  makes certain  that  the  language  is  correct and consistent. After  passing  the  House  last  year, H.R.  149  was  amended  by  the  Senate with  some  other  necessary  changes that were brought  to our attention.  Included  in  the  Senate  amendments  are changes  dealing  with  the  Presidio Trust,  the  North  Carolina  Park  Foundation,  the  Grand  Staircase-Escalante National  Monument,  and  the  retention of  National  Park  entrance  and  recreation  fees  at  the  unit  where  it  is  collected. I  believe  now  we  have  addressed  all the  corrections  that  need  to  be  made. This  bill  is  supported  by  the  administration,  and  I  urge  my  colleagues  to give  their  support  on  H.R.  149,  as amended. Mr.  Speaker,  if  I  may  continue,  during  the  consideration  of  H.R.  149,  the of Senate committee adopted a number of technical  and  clarifying  amendments which  were  explained  in  detail  in  the section by section analysis below. In  addition  to  the  technical  and clarifying  amendments,  the  committee adopted  amendments which  expand  the authorities  of  the  Presidio  Trust.  The amendments,  one,  authorize  the  Trust to expend  funds  for  insurance and business-related  expenses  appropriate  to the  business  activities  of  the  Trust; two,  make  clear  that  the  Administrative  Dispute  Resolution  Act  applies  to the  Presidio  Trust,  and  that  the  Trust has  the  same authority  to pursue binding  arbitration  under  that  act  as  any other  executive  agency,  as  defined  in Section  103  and  105  of  title  V  of  the United  States  Code;  three,  clarify  that the  term  \u2018\u2018proceeds\u2019\u2019  as  used  in  section 104(g)  of  public  law  104\u2013333  includes  all revenues of the Trust; four, clarify that the scope of the Trust rules and regulations  includes rules and regulations  for the  use  and  management  of  the  property under the Trust jurisdiction. Mr.  Speaker,  I  reserve  the  balance  my time. Mr.  MURTHA.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  H.R.  149  is  a  housekeeping measure that originally passed the  House  in  February  of  1999.  The  bill made  numerous  technical  corrections in  the  Omnibus  Parks  and  Public Lands Act  of  1996  and  other  laws  to  fix punctuation, map references, and other minor drafting errors that we exist. We have no objection to the bill. Mr.  NUSSLE.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to express my  support  for a provision  in H.R. 149 which  is  of  importance  to  the  people  of  Iowa\u2019s Second  District.  H.R.  149  authorizes  the change  of  designation  for  the  America\u2019s  Agriculture  Heritage  Partnership  from  the  Agriculture  Department  to  the  Interior  Department. The  Omnibus  National  Park  and  Public Lands  Act  of  1996  (P.L.  104\u2013333)  established the  America\u2019s  Agriculture  Heritage  Partnership,  more  commonly  known  as  Silos  and Smokestacks,  to  present  and  interpret  the  history  of  agriculture  in  America.  Along  with  Silos and  Smokestacks,  this  act  established  nine other  historical  tourist  parks  as  National  Heritage  Areas.  When  originally  created,  Silos  and Smokestacks  was  the  only  National  Heritage Area  not  designated  under  the  Interior  Department. Since  1996,  all  of  the  other  National  Heritage  Areas  have  been  able  to  coordinate  their efforts  because  of  the  coalition  they  formed under  the  Interior  Department.  While  the Board  of  Trustees  for  Silos  and  Smokestacks originally  sought  authorization  through  the  Agriculture  Department  in  1996,  the  current Board  of  Trustees  is  seeking  to  change  its designation  to  the  Interior Department. I  introduced  the  America\u2019s  Agriculture  Heritage  Partnership  Amendments  of  1999  (H.R. 1493)  to  change  this  designation  at  the  request  of  the  current  Board  of  Trustees.  I  am pleased  that  this  legislation  was  included  in H.R.  149.  H.R.  149  will  allow  Silos  and Smokestacks  to  be  included  in  the  coalition and  continue  its  efforts  to  provide  a  unique view of our nation\u2019s agriculture heritage. Mr.  MURTHA.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  back the balance of my time. yield yield Mr.  HANSEN.  Mr.  Speaker,  back the balance of my time. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  The question  is  on  the  motion  offered  by the gentleman  from Utah  (Mr. HANSEN) that  the  House  suspend  the  rules  and concur  in  the  Senate  amendments  to the bill, H.R. 149. The  question  was  taken;  and  (twothirds  having  voted  in  favor  thereof) the  rules  were  suspended  and  the  Senate amendments were concurred in. A  motion  to  reconsider  was  laid  the table. I  on f CARTER  G.  WOODSON  HOME  NATIONAL  HISTORIC  SITE  STUDY ACT  OF  1999 Mr. HANSEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the  rules  and  pass  the  bill (H.R.  3201)  to  authorize  the  Secretary of  the  Interior  to  study  the  suitability and  feasibility  of  designating  the Carter  G.  Woodson  home  in  the  District of Columbia as a national historic site, and for other purposes The Clerk read as follows: H.R. 3201 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives  of  the  United  States  of  America  in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This  Act  may  be  cited  as  the  Woodson Home National Historic  Act of 1999\u2019\u2019. \u2018\u2018Carter  G. Site  Study SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Dr. Carter G. Woodson, cognizant of the widespread  ignorance  and  scanty  information concerning the history of African Americans,  founded  on  September  9,  1915,  the  Association  for  the  Study  of  Negro  Life  and History,  since  renamed  the  Association  for the Study  of African-American Life  and History. (2)  The  Association  was  founded  in  particular to counter racist propaganda alleging black  inferiority  and  the  pervasive  influence of Jim Crow prevalent at the time. (3) The mission  of  the Association was  and continues to be educating the American public  of  the  contributions  of  Black  Americans in  the  formation  of  the  Nation\u2019s  history  and culture. (4) Dr. Woodson dedicated nearly his entire adult life to every aspect of the Association\u2019s operations in furtherance of its mission. (5) Among  the  notable  accomplishments  of the  Association  under  Dr.  Woodson\u2019s  leadership,  Negro  History  Week  was  instituted  in 1926 to be celebrated annually during the second  week  of  February.  Negro  History  Week has  since  evolved  into  Black History Month. (6)  The  headquarters  and  center  of  operations  of  the  Association  was  Dr.  Woodson\u2019s residence,  located  at  1538  Ninth  Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. For  purposes  of  this  Act,  the  term  \u2018\u2018Secretary\u2019\u2019 means  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior, acting  through  the  Director  of  the  National Park Service. SEC. 4. STUDY.

That  service  included  two  tours  in  Vietnam  with  the artillery. Sergeant Nation was certified by  the Veterans Administration as  suffering  cancer  from  exposure  to  Agent Orange during that war. Here  is  the benefit  that Sergeant Nation received: because there was not an Army  or  VA  hospital  within  21\u20442 hours of their home, they had to seek civilian treatment.  Because  Barbara  had  private  health  insurance  through  her  job at  Carolina  Power  &  Light,  CHAMPUS refused  to  accept  primary  responsibility  for  John\u2019s  treatment.  When CHAMPUS  received  the  portion  of John\u2019s  bills  not  covered  by  the  private insurance,  they  still  refused  to  pay  for the  vast  majority  of  the  care.  They told Barbara, his wife, that the charges exceeded  their  rate  schedule,  so  they were not obligated to pay anything. On bills  that were within  their  rate  schedule,  CHAMPUS  rejected  the  majority of  chemotherapy,  radiation,  and  hospital  charges  on  technical  grounds. John  passed  away.  Barbara  was  forced to  surrender  her  entire  retirement  savings  to  pay  the  bills  rejected  by CHAMPUS. Now,  I  ask  every  Member  of  this House,  is  this  fully  funded  health  care for  life  as  promised?  Does  the  treatment  that  Sergeant  First  Class  John Nation  received  from  the  U.S.  Government  qualify  as  having  provided  the benefits  that  he  and  his  family  were promised? John  Nation  honored  his  part  of  the contract. We  failed  to  honor  ours.  It  is time  we made  good  on  our  promises  to the  Nation\u2019s  military  retirees;  and  I urge  each  and  every  one  of  you  to  support  H.R.  3573,  the  Keep  Our  Promises to America\u2019s Military Retirees Act.  260 Members  have  now  cosponsored  this bill so that we may keep our word. It is important  that  the  Federal  Government keep  its word. You  cannot  expect retention  to  improve  in  the  military; you  cannot  expect  that  people  are going  to  stay  in  as  a  career,  when  we will not keep our word to them. Mr.  Speaker,  this  should  be  one  of our  top  priorities,  because  it  is  the right  thing  for  the  United  States  Government  to  do  for  the  men  and  women that  risked  life and  limb  to defend  this Nation. f SLAUGHHEATING  OIL  CRISIS  IN  NEW  YORK The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Under  a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman  from  New  York  (Ms.  TER) is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms.  SLAUGHTER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I simply  want  to  bring  to  the  attention of  Congress  the  situation  of  the  people that  I  represent  in  Monroe  County, New  York.  Some  of  them  are  up  there now  trying  to  shovel  snow  off  their roofs.  We  have  the  dubious  distinction this year of having had more snow than anyplace  in  the  United  States,  a  distinction  that  we  really  prefer  go  to Buffalo or Oswego. I  have  an  extraordinary  number  of retired  persons  as  well.  In  addition  to the  high  cost  of  prescription  drugs, they  are  now  being  forced  to  decide whether  they  will  eat  or  pay  the  soaring home heating costs. b 1630 The  families  have  seen  the  price  of home  heating  oil  rise  on  an  hourly basis. There  has  been  no way  to  understand  it, to plan  for  it, or to budget  for it.  They  are  upset,  and  those  who  are on  low and  fixed  incomes are having  to choose  again  between  everything  else that  they  do  and  heating  their  homes, which  really  is  not  a  choice.  With  the temperatures  that  we  have  had  this January  and  February,  we  have  had over 21 days of straight snow this year. There  is  no  option  but  not  to  freeze  to death. We  have  had  numbers  of  truckers who have called us and told us that the extraordinary  high  rise  in  diesel  fuel, over  $2  a  gallon  an  increase,  has  made it  impossible  for many of  them  even  to continue  to  run  their  rigs  and  they have  put  them  aside  until,  as  Washington says, help is on the way. I  understand  what  the  President  said that  once  this  cold  snap  is  over,  that we  hope  that  the  prices  will  go  down, but in the meantime, I have people who are  in  severe  crisis.  I  am  happy  that there  is  going  to  be  a  summit  tomorrow  on  this,  but  I  frankly  think  that the  cautious  approach  that  the  White House  is  taking  is  too  little  and  too late. We  know  that  actions  will  speak louder  than  words.  It  is  really  critical that this year, because this is a debate, as  my  colleagues  have  pointed  out, that  we  have  year  after  year,  that  we do  something  about  it  to  take  care  of these  permanent  needs  that  the Northeast  has  for  heating  assistance.  I  have joined on to legislation that I hope will do just that this year. We  hate  to  come  every  year  and  talk about  how  our  people  again  are  freezing  to  death,  although  I  think  we  are really  quite  generous  in  helping  when other Members of Congress come to the floor  with  problems  in  their  district that nature has given to them. But it is really  important  that we  do  something about this this time. Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  not  sure  prices have  risen.  I  agree with  tleman  from  New  York  (Mr.  who  spoke  previously  that  it  needs  a good  investigation  to  make  sure  that at this time when temperatures are low that  these  costs  are  not  deliberate.  It is very important that we look at that. In the meantime, I would like to urge the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Energy  to  really  include  the  action  right now  of  releasing  some  oil  from  the strategic  petroleum  reserve.  We  must, as  I  said  before,  start  a  home-heating oil  reserve  in  the Northeast  so  that we can  have  a  long-term  solution  to  this crisis. One  solution may be, as many  speakers  before  me  have  pointed  out,  and  I why  the the  genCROWLEY) know  that  the  President  had  brought up  one  year,  is  that  why  should LIHEAP  money,  which  is  really  used for  low-income  heating,  be  sent throughout  the  50 States  and  the  territories. Might  it  not  be more  important that  we  send  it  to  places  where  it  is needed,  and  I  would  like  to  have  that looked  into as well. But action and not delay is needed now. So,  on  behalf  of  all  of  my  constituents today who are out trying to shovel off  the  roof,  to  make  sure  that  the pipes  are  not  frozen,  keeping  the  heat in  the house as  low as  they can  so  that they can afford to eat,  I want to say to my  colleagues  and  to  everyone  in  this Congress  that  Mother  Nature  waits  on no  one  and  that  quick  action  is  needed for the people of the Northeast. f the  ALLEN)  PRESCRIPTION  DRUG  BENEFITS The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. OSE).  Under  the  Speaker\u2019s  announced policy  of  January  6,  1999,  the  gentleman  from Maine  (Mr.  is  recognized  for  60  minutes  as  designee of the minority leader. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, Congress is back  in  session;  and  while  we  are  resuming  our  work,  we  have  to  attend first  to  part  of  the  unfinished  business of  last  year.  All  across  this  country, seniors are finding it harder and harder to  take  their  prescription  drugs,  because  they  simply  cannot  afford  to take  the medication  that  their  doctors tell them they must take. They are not following  doctor\u2019s  orders,  simply  because  they  cannot  afford  their medication. We  have  looked  at  this  issue  over the  past  year,  the  Democrats  have looked  at  this  issue,  and  are  ready  to go  again,  ready  to  do  some work  to  relieve  the  problems  that  seniors  and others  are  facing  all  around  this country. We  need  to  do  two  things.  First,  we need  to  stop  price  discrimination against  seniors.  Second,  we  need  to provide  a  universal  prescription  drug benefit under Medicare. Let  us  start with what  is  going  on  in the  real world.  In  the  real world, many seniors  are  not  filling  their  prescriptions or, when they do, they are taking one  pill  out  of  three.  However,  all across  this  country,  they  are  finding they  simply  cannot  afford  to  take  the drugs  that  their doctors  tell them  they have to take. Starting  in my  district  of Maine,  the First  District  of  Maine  and  extending all  across  this  country,  the  democratic staff  of  the  Committee  on  Government Reform  has  done  a  series  of  studies. The  first  of  those  studies  which  I  released  in  July  of  1998  show  this:  on  average,  seniors  pay  twice  as  much  for their  medication  as  the  drug  company\u2019s  best  customers.  Well,  who  are the  best  customers?

Mr. Speaker,  I want  to speak  about  HMO  reform  and  about campaign finance reform today. Let me start out with HMO reform. A  few  years  ago  down  in  Texas,  the Texas  Legislature  passed  a  series  of HMO  reform  bills  almost  unanimously in  their  State  legislature.  These  bills addressed  issues  like  emergency  room care.  If  you  had  a  crushing  chest  pain and  thought  you  were  going  to  have  a heart attack, you could go to the emergency  room  and  then  the  HMO  could not  come  back  and  say  afterwards  if the  EKG  was  normal,  well,  we  are  not going to pay for this. The  Texas  legislature  addressed issues  like  access  to  specialists.  They addressed  issues  like  when  an  HMO would  say  we  do  not  think  that  that treatment  that  your  doctor  and  your specialist  have  recommended  is  medically  necessary  and  then  deny  that care just arbitrarily. So  they  held  a  big  debate  in  Texas. This  was  now  about  3  or  4  years  ago. And  the  Texas  legislature  passed  a  series  of  bills,  some  of  them  almost unanimously, without dissenting vote I think  in  the  Texas  Senate  and  maybe with  only  two  dissenting  votes  in  the Texas  House,  sent  those  bills  to  the governor\u2019s  desk,  and  he  allowed  them to become law. At  that  time,  the  HMO  industry  in Texas  said  the  sky  would  fall,  the  sky would  fall.  You  will  see  a  plethora  of lawsuits; you will  see  premiums  go  out of sight; you will see the HMO industry in Texas shrivel up and move away. Well,  what  has  been  the  actual  result?  The  actual  result  has  been  that, since  Texas  passed  its  law,  there  have only  been  about  four  lawsuits  filed  in the  last  several  years;  and  those  were primarily  when  the  HMOs  did  not  follow  the  law.  The  premiums  did  not  go up  significantly.  There  were  30  HMOs in  Texas  when  the  bills  were  passed, and  there  are  over  50  now.  That  law  is working. So we  passed  a  bill here  in  the House that  was modeled  after  that  Texas  legislation,  legislation  that  Governor Bush,  for  instance,  has  said  that  he agrees  with  and  thinks  ought  to  be Federal  law.  We  passed  that  bill.  And, once again, the HMOs said, the sky will fall, the sky will fall; premiums will go out of sight; etcetera. Well,  we  got  a  score  back  from  the Congressional  Budget  Office  on  the cost  of  the  bill  that  we  passed  here  on the  floor  by  a  vote  of  275\u2013151. And  over 5  years,  the  Congressional  Budget  Office  said  the  cost  of  that  legislation would  cause  premiums  to  go  up  about 4.1  percent  total,  nothing  in  the  first year  probably,  and  then maybe  about  1 percent each year for about 4 years and that would be it. The cost of that reflected in the average  premium  for  a  family  would  be about  the  cost  of  a  Big  Mac  meal  once a month. Not exactly the sky is falling, the  sky  is  falling.  In  fact,  the  part  of the bill that cost the most was the part that  is  designed  to  prevent  lawsuits, the  and  to  the  will  the genexternal internal  Speaker,  and  that  was  reviews part. So  I would  call my  colleagues\u2019  attention  to  the  Congressional  Budget  Office.  But  be  careful,  because  the  HMO industry in the past has said that these percentage  increases  are  annual  percentage increases. That is wrong. When we  see  4  percent,  okay,  that  is  4  percent  cumulative  over  5  years.  So  be careful on that. Mr.  SHAYS.  Mr.  gentleman yield? Mr.  GANSKE.  I  yield  tleman from Connecticut. Mr. SHAYS. Mr. Speaker, I have seen the gentleman  from  Iowa  (Mr. GANSKE) on  the  floor  of  the  House  so  many times  talking  about  this  issue.  And  I have learned a lot. I have learned a tremendous  amount,  and  it  was  ultimately  why  I  was  very  happy  to  support his legislation. I  represent  a  district  with  a  lot  of Democrats,  a  lot  of  Republicans,  a  lot of  conservatives,  a  lot  of  moderates and liberals. It is a very mixed district. But  in  one  town  meeting  I  had  in Greenwich,  Connecticut,  which  is  pretty  much  a  more  conservative  area  of my  district,  I  had  a  number  of  people at  a  town  meeting.  They  were  young. They  were  old.  I  could  tell  from  the very  issues  they  were  talking  about that  they  were  the  whole  range  of  the political  spectrum.  And  I  asked  this question,  I  said,  \u2018\u2018How  many  of  you think that  if an HMO causes the  injury or  death  of  someone  that  they  should be held accountable or liable?\u2019\u2019 I expected about maybe  two-thirds of the  hands  to  go  up.  Every  hand  went up.  In  fact,  in  some  cases  both  hands went  up.  And  then  there  was  story after story. And I also submitted to my constituents  a  questionnaire  asking them  about  health  care  and  there were various  choices,  and  one  of  them  was we  should  keep  the  health  care  system the  way  it  is.  Only  3.5  percent  responded that we should keep it the way it  is.  This  really  kind  of  shocked  me. Twenty-five  percent  wanted  to  eliminate HMOs. Now,  I  am  a  strong  supporter  of health  maintenance  organizations,  but to  have  25  percent  of  the  15,000  people who  responded  to  my  questionnaire wanting  to  get  rid  of HMOs  for me was a  big  wake-up  call.  And  it  just  spoke volumes about how we need  to do what is  in  the  legislation  that  my  colleague has  championed.  To  be  able  to  have  a process that would encourage people to get  the  proper  health  care  that  they need  without  going  through  a  litigation process makes eminent sense. But, in  the  end,  there  always  has  to  be  that final  hammer  to  try  to  encourage sometimes proper behavior. I  want  to  thank  my  colleague  for being  such  a  fighter  on  this  issue.  And I know  and  I  hope  that we will  eventually  get  to  another  issue  that  is  near and dear to both him and me. But  I appreciate  what  he  has  done  for  so  long on this issue. Mr.  GANSKE.  Mr.  ciate  my  colleague  Speaker,  I  apprefrom  Connecticut WAMP) SHAYS)  SHAYS)  (Mr.  joining me  for  this  special order because I think that we are going to  have  some  fun  with  some  of  these issues. This  is  one  of  the  reform  issues  that we  are  dealing  with  here  in  Congress. My  colleague  has  been  a  leader  on  one of  the  other  reform  issues,  and  that  is campaign  finance  reform;  and  I  have been  happy  to  work  with  him  on  that issue.  I  am  glad  that  he  is  here.  Because now  that  this  issue,  campaign  finance  reform,  has  really  come  to  the front  of  the  presidential  campaigns,  I hear  things  said  by  some  candidates that  make  me  concerned.  It  is  almost like  you  could  not  be  a  Republican  if you  support  campaign  finance  reform, even  though  there  are  a  lot  of  Republicans  who  support  campaign  finance reform. There  are  a  lot  of  Republicans  who support campaign finance reform, and I worked  with  the  gentleman  from  Connecticut  (Mr.  on  this  issue  all across  the  political  spectrum.  I  have  a pretty darn conservative voting record, and  there  are  lots  of  other  conservatives  who  have  joined  with  him  on this  issue  because  we  feel  so  strongly that  this  is  so  important  to  the  honesty  and  integrity  of  our  political  system. I mean, we have a gentleman like the gentleman  from  Tennessee  (Mr.  who  is  really  a  conservative  Republican.  We  have  a  conservative  Republican,  the  gentleman  from  South  Carolina  (Mr. GRAHAM), who  has  stuck with us  on  this  issue.  And  so  I  want  to  address the issue today. When  we  talk  about  campaign  finance  reform,  let  us  do  a  little  education of our  colleagues on  this.  I wonder  if  the  gentleman  from  Connecticut (Mr.  can  sort  of  share  with  us how  this  issue  got  started  really  full blast  in  1995  and  1996.  Why  do  we  need campaign finance reform? Mr. SHAYS. Mr. Speaker, there are a number  of  reasons why we  need  it;  and we  need  it  more  desperately  as  each year goes. But I would first say that we have  needed  to  reform  the  system  for many years. One of the things that is very clear is we  have  had  a  hard  time  finding  consensus  because  we  each  have  our  own campaign finance reform bill. So one of the  first  key  things  to  do  was  to  see  if we  could  build  consensus  amongst  different groups. But  in  terms  of  why  we  need  it,  we need  it  because,  in  this  democrat  system  of  government,  we  need  to  make sure  that  decisions  are  being  made based  on  merit  and  based  on  what  is right  for  our  country  and  not  based  on who  gave  me  this  campaign  contribution or that campaign contribution. b 1745 When  you  had  the  abuses  in  1974  centered  around  Watergate  and  all  that was  involved,  the majority  party made two  decisions.  One,  they  were  going  to hold  President  Nixon  accountable  and they were secondly going to reform the SHAYS)  VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:50 Feb 16, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K15FE7.142 pfrm02 PsN: H15PT1 ",

It  impacts the legislative agenda of so many of  us,  of  which  we  would  hope  that  we would  have  a  bipartisan  support  on issues like affirmative action, on issues like  the  Voters  Rights  Act,  on  issues like  racial  profiling,  on  issues  like  equitable  funding  for  historically  black colleges. I  want  to  bring  to  our  attention  a young  man  by  the  name  of  Jerick Crow. I had the opportunity of meeting him. He wrote a personal note to me  in this  book  that  was  written  about  him, \u2018\u2018Thank  you  for  your  help  with  issues dealing with violence and youth.\u2019\u2019 Jerick  was  an  African  American youth,  quite  handsome  I  might  admit. His  picture  is  in  the  book  as  a  third grader,  and  I  would  like  to  bring  our attention  that  in  the  book  there  are hard  lessons,  because  Jerick  now  is  in a wheelchair. He is one of those African American  young  men  statistics  who was  in  a  gang  that  wound  up  in  a  violent  result,  not  losing  his  life  but  certainly losing his ability to be mobile. He  talks  about  his  life.  He  talks about the  fact that his  father died; and so he was one of those statistics, not of his own doing, a child without a father. He talks about that he did have dreams and  aspirations,  but  all  of  a  sudden something  came  over  him.  He  stopped studying.  He  stopped  doing  his  homework.  He  had  failing  grades,  and  then all  of  a  sudden  he  did  something  that many  of  our  young  African  American men,  young  men,  young  boys  do  and are  still  doing,  and  that  is  joining gangs.  I  bring  that  to  our  attention  in a  discussion  of  African  American  history  because  I  think  we  are  remiss  if we do not take the collective history of our people and why  ills  fall upon them. He  has  turned  his  life  around,  but part  of  the  tragedy  of  the  gangs  in  our community  and  the  violence  in  our community again is because there were not  enough  legislative  initiatives  or collective community understanding of how our history impacted how we functioned  as  a  race  of  people,  how  being isolated without a  father, how not having  the  support  systems  that  really sometimes  came  out  of  segregation, how  not  addressing  the  question,  no matter  how  some  of  us  may  feel  it  is serious  and  others  may  look  at  it  humorously, the issue of reparations. When  I  say  that  there  was  never  any compensation to African Americans because  of  slavery,  in  fact,  when  we  discuss  it  now,  and  I  am  almost  positive that if anyone is listening in my hometown,  I  would  say  to  the  gentleman from New York  (Mr. OWENS), we  can be assured  that  950  Radio,  one  of  the  conservative  talk  shows  that  come  on every  morning  in  Houston,  that  unfortunately most of the listeners and callers  in,  including  the  host  of  that  particular  radio  show,  a  good  friend  of mine,  we  have  had  an  opportunity  to talk  over  the  years,  continues  to  bash those of us who would  raise  issues  that are controversial; controversial as they relate  to  race,  the  need  for  affirmative action,  again  the  need  for  addressing the  question  of  racial  profiling,  the need  for  addressing  the  divisiveness  of flying  a  Confederate  flag  over  a  Federal  building.  I  think  part  of  it  is  because  America  has  not  accepted  in  a collective  and  collaborative  fashion that African American history  is a history  of  America.  If  we  would  do  that, we would go so much further in solving these problems. Let  me  cite  one  other  feature  and note.  This  is  not  to  put  Los Angeles  in a  negative  light,  but  I  do  want  to  cite racial  and  ethnic  tensions  in American communities,  poverty,  equality  and discrimination.  This  was  a  report  of the United  States  Commission  on  Civil Rights.  In  fact,  today  we  were  in  a Committee  on  the  Judiciary  meeting and it was dealing with the budget, and there  was  a  great  deal  of  discussion, unfortunately  not  bipartisan  discussion,  of  criticism  of  the  United  States Commission  on  Civil Rights,  and many of  us were  trying  to make  the  point  do we  not want  the  Committee  on  the  Judiciary  to  stand  on  the  side  of  enforcing  civil  rights?  Do  we  not  want  to have any budget that may be passed by this House in a bipartisan way increase funding for civil rights? b 1900 Let  me  just  briefly  say  that  this  report  coming  out  of  May  1999,  which  is one of  the  reasons why we may not get the  kind  of  funding  that  we  should  get because  people  are  offended  by  the truth,  it  says,  racial  and  ethnic  bias, the  revelation  of  former  LAPD  Detective  Mark  Furman\u2019s  racist  comments during  the  O.J.  Simpson  trial  brought to  the  floor  the  existence of  racial  tension within the LAPD. While  many  officers  thought  Detective  Furman\u2019s  attitude  was  an  aberration,  others maintained  that  such  attitudes were widespread. Many  perceived that  racial  and  ethnic  tension  within the department is increasing. Mr.  Speaker,  in  August  1995,  six black  civilian  detention  officers  and  a black police sergeant filed suit alleging that  the  city,  the  police  department, the  police  commission  are  condoning overt  racism  and  failing  to  deal  with the complaints of discrimination. Why  am  I  saying  all  of  this?  Mr. Speaker, as  I was  saying  in  1995, a  lawsuit was filed by members in the LAPD and  civilians  to  indicate  that  the  officials were condoning overt racism. As I was saying, this is a part of African  American  history.  It  is  a  part  of American  history.  It  is  a  part  of  how we  relate  to  each  other  today.  We  are always  reminded  that  if  we  do  not know our history, we are doomed to repeat  what  was  history.  We  are  doomed to  repeat  it,  or  we  are  doomed  to  go through  it  in  the  future;  that  is  why the  commemoration  of  African  American  history  is  so  very  important,  because we have to reach for it. We  have  to  find  it.  We  have  to  get people  to  seek  it  out.  I  believe  it  is more  of  our  colleagues,  more  Americans  informing  themselves  about  real African  American  history,  the  glorious success stories that we have, the whole litany  of  outstanding  African  Americans which we all applaud, but also get down  into  the  nitty  and  gritty  of  slavery,  reading  slave  narratives,  getting  a full  understanding  of  that  very  dark time  in  our  history;  the  Civil  War  and what  that  meant,  Reconstruction, when  there was  a  great  jubilee  that we as  African  Americans  were  free  and that we would be welcomed as equals in American  society,  and  then  the  ugly head  of  Jim  Crow  rose  up  in  the  1900s. Mr.  Speaker,  I  believe  that  we  must speak  about  African  American  history throughout  the  year,  because  we  will never  get  to  the  point  of  passing  the hate  crimes  legislation,  of  getting  racial profiling  to  the  floor, which  I hope that  we  will  see  a  positive  result  tomorrow  in  the  Committee  on  the  Judiciary, but then to the floor, to the Senate  and  signed  by  the  President.  We will never understand what affirmative action is about in Texas and in Florida, where  they  are  trying  to  overrule  it  or override it. We  will  never  understand  the  importance  of  a  Congressional  Black  Caucus budget.  And  we  will  continue  to  have conservative  talk  shows  who  malign African  American  elected  officials,  because  they  speak  a  different  language of  generosity  than  they might  think  is appropriate,  unless  we  come  together and study our history in an appropriate manner. Mr.  Speaker,  I  commend  the  fact that we now can find our history on the Internet.  I  would  like  to  commend  Dr. Louis  \u2018\u2018Skip\u2019\u2019  Gates, my  colleague  who probably soon will be called the new father  of  African  American  history,  professor at Harvard, who has now put the African  American  encyclopedia  on  the Internet. I  think  we  can  have  a  better  understanding  if  we  learn  each  other\u2019s  history,  if  African  American  history  becomes  the  kind  of  history  that  is  living;  that  is  accepted;  that  is  widespread;  and  that  all  people  understand it,  so  that  we  can  make  this  country better. Mr.  OWENS.  Mr.  Speaker,  the  remarks of  the gentlewoman  from Texas, (Ms. JACKSON-LEE), of course, were pertinent  in  every  way  in  terms  of  the three  items  that  I  have  put  forth  here tonight.

They  have  been  able  to eradicate  them.  We  are  not  on  a  mission that will not succeed, but we must get  the  resources  there.  We  must  get the  equipment  there.  We  must  aid  our allies, who are willing to be partners in this  effort,  especially  in  Colombia, where  we  have  a  great  leader  in  President Pastrana, who  is  trying  to  get  his Nation back together. I  submit,  and  it  was  confirmed  by witnesses  at  our  hearing  today,  the only  reason  the  rebels  are  now  in  Sweden  and  in  Europe  and  talking  about serious  peace  settlement  in  Colombia is  because  the  threat  of  the  resources finally  reaching  there.  It  is  sad  that even  until  a  few  weeks  ago,  the  three Black Hawk helicopters that we had requested,  and  again,  Members  saw  the documents  here  back  some  4  years,  5 years  ago,  that  finally  arrived  the  end of  last  year,  and  it  is  unbelievable, they arrived without proper armor. Today  we  were  told  that  the  armor that was  sent  does  not  fit  on  all  of  the helicopters,  so  some  of  these  are  sent in  nonstrategic  but  support  missions. Some  are  up  and  flying,  but  not  in  the proper  fashion  that  Congress  had  intended. In  addition,  the  ammunition  and mini-guns and other resources to get to the  national  police,  who  are  anti-narcotics  officers  in  Colombia,  still  have not all arrived. It  is unbelievable, but I believe  confirmed  that  half  the  ammunition was  inadvertently delivered during the Christmas holidays to the loading  dock  at  our  State  Department; again,  the  gang  that  cannot  seem  to shoot straight in getting this drug situation under control. Again,  it  is  not  rocket  science.  Almost all of it is coming from Colombia. Seventy-five  percent  of  the  heroin coming  into  the  United  States,  over  75 percent  of  the  cocaine  is  now  sourced there.  Some  of  it  does  transit  through Mexico,  but  if  we  stop  it  at  its  source cost-effectively, we do not have to have 10,000 Border Patrol people there. Even  today  I  see  they  are  becoming threatened  with  bounties  put  on  their heads  by  these  reckless  drug  traffickers. Again, we can win this. We can win it cost-effectively.  We  have  to  learn  by our  mistakes.  It  must  be  an  international  effort,  a  little  bit  of  dollars, with  the  help  of  our  friends,  the  European  communities  willing  to  put  in more  resources,  because  they  also  are becoming  more  victimized,  just  like the United States; with  a  little  help  to Colombia  and  with  a  little  help  from both  sides  of  the  aisle,  not making  the mistakes,  joining  in and saying, we are going  to  get  those  resources  there,  we are not going to wait. If  this  was  Kosovo  and  we  could  not get  the  helicopters  to Kosovo,  it would be  a  disaster.  If we  could  not  have  gotten  the  ammunition  and  the  resources to  our  troops,  and  these  are  not  our troops  we  are  trying  to  supply,  in  the Gulf War, we would have had a disaster there. So  we  can  start  a  real  war  against narcotics.  We  have  thousands  of  lives at  stake.  Out  there  tonight  in  our  districts  are  young  people  who  are  overdosing.  Three  or  four  times  those  who are killed  in Columbine will die tomorrow as a result of drug overdoses in our community,  and  hundreds more,  as  the drug  czar  said  today,  will  die  from  the scourge each day across our Nation. So  we  have  a  great  responsibility  to get our act together, make certain this administration  fulfills  the  will  of  Congress,  and  that  we  get  resources  to those who  can  help  us  bring  this  situation under control. f FALSE  STATEMENTS  CONCERNING THE  F/A\u201318E/F  SUPER  HORNET The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Under the Speaker\u2019s announced policy of January  6,  1999,  the  gentleman  from  California  (Mr.  is  recognized for 60 minutes. CUNNINGHAM)  THE PROBLEM OF INTERNATIONAL TRAFFICKING NARCOTICS Mr.  CUNNINGHAM.  Mr.  Speaker,  I would like to thank my friend, the gentleman  from  Florida,  for  the  presentation  that  he  just  gave.  I  would  add  a couple  of  things  to  it;  first  of  all,  that in  Kosovo  the  KLA  Albanians  have been  described  by  the  CIA  and  FBI  as some  of  the  most  ruthless  and  dangerous  cocaine  and  heroin  dealers  in the  world.  In  Europe  they  are  the major  threat,  and  we  are  starting  to see  the  function  of  that  now.  They  operate  out  of  Kosovo.  They  have  a  clear hand. Secondly,  in  Afghanistan,  another area  in  which  the  terrorists  are  selling drugs  to  support  the  mujaheddin,  the Hamas,  and  recently  in  Israel,  that Israel  is  having  trouble with  right  now in  Lebanon.  So  I  would  thank  the  gentleman  for  his  presentation.  The  lives of  our  children  and  our  grandchildren are  at  stake,  and  the  information  that he  brings  I  have  read  not  only  in  several  articles,  but  have  been  briefed  by our classified sources. Mr. Speaker,  I want  to  talk on  something a little different tonight. On February 7, a member of the other body delivered  on  the  Senate  floor  what  has become  an  annual  tirade  of  false  and misleading  statements  concerning  the Navy\u2019s  number  one  weapons  system procurement,  the  F\u201318E/F  Hornet.  He concluded  at  best  that  the  aircraft  is not  better  than  the  current  airplane, and  probably  is  worse,  and  it  is  enormously  more  expensive  than  continuing with  the  present  FA\u201318C  and D models. Mr. Speaker,  I have  two models here. The  first  is  the F\u201318 C/D. The  second  is the  F\u201318  E/F.  What  I  will  show  in  this next  hour  is  the  extreme  advantage  of the  latter over  the C/D model, and why it  is  necessary  that  the  Navy  has  its number one aircraft for the future. Secondly,  the  gentleman  from  other  body  has  never  served  in  the the military  who  was  talking  about  these two  aircraft. He  has  a  zero  rating  from all  defense  groups  and  agencies.  He stated  his  own  opinion  as  fact,  and  I would  say  that  the  gentleman  in  the other body  is extremely  factually challenged.  The  gentleman  has  never served  in  the  armed  service.  The  only credential  that  he  has  is  that  he  is  liberal. I say this based on my knowledge and experience  in  carrier  aviation,  and  on intelligence  briefs  presented  to  me  recently  by  the  Department  of  Defense and  by  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency.  It  concerns,  first,  the  current,  and more  importantly,  the  projected  military  threat  that  will  face  our  defense forces over the next decade. We need to take  seriously  a  look  at  not  only  what the  current  threat  is  that  we  could face,  our  men  and  women  in  all  services,  and  secondly,  it  concerns  the weapons  we  are  planning  to  acquire  to defeat that threat. When  we  look  at  the  threat,  we  look at  the  future  threat  10  years,  20  years, even 30 years from now, it should be determined  on what  direction we  go with the  planning  and  the  aircraft  and equipment  that  we  buy  presently,  and the  training  of  the  men  and  women  in our Armed Forces. I  would  say  that  many  of  the  Members  have  received  this  intelligence briefing.  I  would  encourage  the  gentleman  from  the  other  body  to  do  so. The  classified  briefings  can  bring  insight  into  what  those  actual  threats are  and  the  direction  that  we  need  to go. b 2030 I  would  ask,  Mr.  Speaker,  what brings DUKE CUNNINGHAM, a Republican from  California,  why  should  I  be  such another  expert,  other  than  the  gentleman in the other body? First  of  all,  I  served  20  years  in  the United  States  Navy.  I  was  a  Top  Gun student.  I  was  a  Top  Gun  instructor.  I was  commanding  officer  of  the  adversary  squadron.  I  was  on  the  Defense Authorization  Committee,  and  I  am now  on  the  Defense  Committee  on  Appropriations  and  sat  in  on many  of  the Intel  briefings.  I  would  tell  the  gentleman  that  I  have  flown  the  F\u201314.  I have  flown  the  Air  Force  F\u201315.  I  have flown  the  F\u201316,  the  F\u201318C/D  and  the  F\u2013 18E/F that we are talking about. I have flown  in  the Middle  East,  and  I  flew  in Israel  in  1973  and  1974.  I  have  flown against  enemy  aircraft  in  combat,  and I  have  shot  down  many  of  those  aircraft. I have also flown against them in peacetime  to  judge  their  capabilities, and I helped develop the tactics against those particular aircraft. The  gentleman  in  the  other  body  has none  of  these  capabilities  or  none  of this knowledge.

            "76": "H450 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:69) February 15, 2000 in  WALSH suspended  the  agreement,  suspended the  Good  Friday  Agreement  and  they took  all  the  powers  back  to  London, away from Belfast. I  think  what  is  lost  all  of  this  is, and  Congressman  mentioned this  in  his  speech,  this  was  illegal. There was no legal justification for one government, the British government to eviscerate  an  internationally  arrived at agreement. This was a  formal agreement  which  was  arrived  at  by  Great Britain,  by  the  government  of  Ireland, and by all of the signators to the agreement,  including Gerry Adams and Sinn Fein, and it was an agreement that was ratified  by  90  percent  of  the  people  in the Republic of Ireland and over 70 percent  of  the  people  in  the  north  of  Ireland.  Yet,  even  though  not  one  provision  of  that  agreement  was  violated, the  British  have  now  reimposed  direct rule  in  Northern  Ireland,  and  there  is no legal basis for that. Now,  the  argument  can  be made,  and I  can  understand  it  to  some  extent, that  the  British  found  that  if  they  did not  do  this,  the  peace  process  would collapse.  Well,  what  they  have  done  is they have in effect; not in effect, but in reality,  they  have  violated  the  law  for what  they  feel  is  the  greater  good  of preserving  the  peace  process.  Well,  if that  is their motive,  then  there  is even more  of  an  incentive  on  them  to make sure this peace process works. They have to let David Trimble know that  he  cannot  be  the  final  arbiter  of what  is  acceptable.  Already  he  is  saying he wants the British government to renegotiate  what  is  going  to  happen with  the  Northern  Ireland  police  force, the royal constabulary. He wants to renegotiate any number of items that are in  the  Good  Friday  Agreement.  He  has no  right  to  renegotiate  anything.  This was  an  agreement  that  was  formally ratified  and  approved  by  referendum and  signed  by  the  two  governments, and  he  has  absolutely  no  right  to  be doing  this;  yet,  he  is  giving  the  clear impression that he is a veto power over the process. If  that  is  the  case,  how  can  anyone expect  the  Republican  community,  the IRA,  Sinn  Fein,  or  his  rank  and  file Catholics  living  in  places  like  Derry and  West  Belfast,  how  can  we  expect them  to  have  faith  in  the  system  if David Trimble can undo it whenever he wants  to;  if  he  can  rewrite  an  agreement  whenever  it  suits  him.  What  is the incentive to go into the agreement. What  is  the  incentive  to  enter  into  a peace process if David Trimble can just pull  the  rug  out whenever  he wants  to. That  is  why  it  is  so  essential  that  the British  government  make  it  clear  that David  Trimble  is  not  going  to  be  allowed  to  continue  to  ride  roughshod over  a  lawful  process  and  he  is  not going  to  be  able  to  literally  rip  up agreements when he chooses to do so. Also,  if  there  is  going  to  be  an  ultimate  agreement  reached  in  this  whole decommissioning  issue,  it  is  essential that it be resolved once and for all, and that it involve all the guns in Northern WALSH Ireland.  Again,  Congressman  has  mentioned  this.  There  is  the  guns of  the  British  army;  there  is  the  military  installations  of  the  British  army, many of which were increased after the IRA  cease-fire  went  into  effect.  There is  also,  and many  people  do  not  realize this,  150,000  Unionist  guns  in  Northern Ireland,  so-called  legal  guns.  These  are guns which the British government and the  Northern  Ireland  authorities  have allowed  the  unions  to  have,  150,000 legal guns. They  also  have what  are  called  35,000 personal  security  guns which  are  given to  people  in  public  life  or  people  who feel  that  they  are  being  threatened. None  of  those  guns  are  given  to  members, for instance, of Sinn Fein. Almost all  of  those  guns  go  to  Unionists  and Loyalists  and  yet,  I  believe  the  facts will  bear me  out  on  this,  that no  political party in the western world has had more  fatalities and more  casualties because  of  political  violence  than  Sinn Fein. Sinn  Fein\u2019s  officials  have  been  attacked, they have been shot, murdered, wounded, and maimed; and yet nothing is  done  at  all  to  protect  them,  and  all we  hear  about  are  the  guns  of  the  IRA. Also,  there  are  the  guns  of  the  loyalist paramilitaries,  the  Ulster  Volunteer Force,  the  Ulster  Defense  Association, and any number of others, we can go on and list them all. So all of this has to be addressed. The entire issue of guns in northern Ireland has  to  be  addressed.  Yes,  the  IRA  did walk  away  from  the  negotiations today.  However,  as  Congressman McCarthy said, they did not walk away from  the  peace  process,  and  that  is  important to remember. Mr.  Speaker,  I  cannot  say  what  I would  do  if  I  were  in  their  place,  but  I can  certainly  understand  the  logic  in what they did. Because back in November  they  made  a  solid  agreement  with Senator  Mitchell  that  they  would  send a  representative  to  the  decommissioning  commission  to  meet,  discuss decommissioning  in  return  for  David Trimble allowing the government to be set  up  in  Northern  Ireland.  Now  that that  government  has  been  suspended, the  IRA  feels  why  should  it  keep  its end  of  the  agreement  if  David  Trimble is not keeping his. But  significantly,  it has  been  made  clear  to  all  of  us  who have  looked  into  this  that  the  IRA  has no  intention of breaking  the cease-fire; the  cease-fire  is  intact  and  it  is  going to  remain  intact. So  they are  still part of  the  peace  process  even  though  they are  not  at  the  table  of  the  decommissioning body. How much  longer  can  this  be  risked? How  much  longer  is  Tony  Blair  going to  allow  these  games  to  be  played where  one  person  can  undermine  and unravel  the  peace  process  that  has taken  years  to  be  put  together?  The key  player  in  that  quite  frankly  has been  President  Clinton.  He  has  done  a tremendous  job  in  keeping  the  parties together.  Certainly  over  the  last  several  weeks,  I  know  the  President  was personally  involved  in  this.  He  and members  of  the  National  Security Council were  in  contact with  all  of  the parties  and  were  responsible  for  keeping  the  process  going  as  long  as  they did.  I  am,  however,  critical  of  the statement  the  White  House  put  out where  it  seemed  to put  the onus on  the IRA  for  not  coming  in  sooner  with their  proposal.  The  fact  is,  as  we  said before,  they  have  under  no  obligation to  submit  any  proposal  at  all,  and  it appears as  if the proposal they did submit  was  known  to  Peter  Mandelson  in advance,  and  yet  he  still  took  no  action  to  stop  the  suspension  of  the  government,  which  leads  to  the  belief  he was  going  to  suspend  the  government anyway  just  as  a  way  to  protect  David Trimble. So in the days and weeks ahead as we head  towards  St.  Patrick\u2019s  Day,  which will  be  approximately  five  weeks  I guess  from  today,  or  probably  four weeks  from  this  week,  it  is  so  important  that  all  of  us,  and  all  Americans, not just Irish Americans but all Americans  who  care  about  peace  and  justice in Ireland, will stand together, stand as one.  Yes,  we  are  more  than  willing  to work  with  David  Trimble,  work  with the British government, work with any of  the  parties  who  are  honestly  committed to the peace process. b 2145 But  we  cannot  allow  ourselves  to  be used  as  accessories  to  a  game  where David  Trimble  rewrites  the  rules,  rewrites  agreements,  and  reneges  on agreements that he has entered into. If  that  is  what  is  done,  there  is  not going to be peace  in Ireland, and  it  is a situation  that  none  of  us  even  want  to contemplate  what  could  happen  if  this unravels,  because  this  is  the  best chance  for  peace  for  all  the  people  in Ireland  probably  in  the  entire  history of  Ireland,  and  certainly  in  the  last  30 years or  75 years. There has never been an  opportunity  such  as  the  one  that  is there today. It  is  there.  It  is  the  good  Friday agreement.  It  is  the  basis which  allows all of the parties to move forward while all  of  the  parties  at  the  same  time make  concessions.  It  is  the  agreement which  provides  the  basis  where  everyone\u2019s  legitimate  rights  are  protected, and  everyone  should  receive  peace  and security,  so  long  as  the  agreement  is fully  implemented. That  is what has to be  done.  That  is  the  role  the  U.S.  can play. Senator Mitchell has done a great job in  the  past.  The  gentleman  from  New York  (Mr.  is  trying  to  bring about  a  divorce  in  the  Mitchell  family by  asking  George  Mitchell  to  go  back again.  He  has  made  the  ultimate  sacrifice  twice  in putting  in  so much  time and  effort.  If  he  is  willing  to  do  it again, God bless him. But we as Americans,  as  Members  of  this  Congress,  as people  who  care  about  the  peace  process  in  Ireland,  we  have  to  do  what  we have to do. We  have  to  work  with  the  President, we have to work with all the parties to WALSH)  VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:50 Feb 16, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K15FE7.192 pfrm02 PsN: H15PT1 ",

The  leading  bill  last Congress  sought  to  fix  the  marriage  penalty  in a manner  that  would  have  inadvertently  penalized  families  that  chose  to  have  one  parent stay at home. I  made  this  point  when  I  testified  before  the Ways  and  Means  Committee  in  support  of  a marriage  tax  proposal  Representative  and  I  developed,  which  doubled  the standard  deduction  for  married  couples  to twice  that of  singles. The  legislation essentially also  doubled  the  tax  brackets  of  married  couples  to  twice  that  of  singles. One  income  families  often  have  the  toughest  time  making  ends meet, particularly  if  they are  raising  children. I  am  gratified  that  the  marriage  penalty  bill the  House  will  pass  today  embraces  the  approach  developed  in  the  tax  bill  I  proposed with  Mr.  The  Marriage  Tax  Relief  Act would  eliminate  or  substantially  reduce  the penalty  for  virtually  every  couple  currently  burdened  by  the  tax.  Furthermore,  marriage  penalty  relief  would  be  targeted  to  primarily  benefit  low and middle-income  families. Critics  complain  that  this  legislation  is  too expensive  or  would  provide  so-called  bonuses to  families  in  which  one  spouse  stays  at  home to  raise  children.  Indeed,  it  would  require Washington  to  give  back  billions  of  dollars  to America\u2019s  families.  and  yes,  the  bill  as  drafted would  lighten  the  tax  burden  for  certain  families  sustained  by  a  single  income.  However, the  preservation  and  security  of  the  smallest, yet  most  important  unit  of  government\u2014the family\u2014is  too  important  to  shortchange  with more  economical,  but  less  effective  proposals. Additionally,  it  simply  isn\u2019t  fair  to  require  married  couples  who  prefer  parent-care  over  daycare  to pay more  in  taxes. For  years,  the  Tax  Code  has  been  used  to penalize  the  creation  and  maintenance  of  cohesive  family  units.  This  is  foolish  and  unfair. The  Marriage  Tax  Relief  Act  of  2000  will  put an  end  to  this  discrimination  and  I  urge  the Senate  to  immediately  pass  this  legislation and  send  it on  to  the President. BOB RILEY RILEY.  \u0001 TRIBUTE  TO  HONDA  CAROLINA OF  SOUTH HON.  JAMES  E.  CLYBURN OF SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 15, 2000 Mr.  CLYBURN.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to bring  to  the  attention  of  my  colleagues  the  recent  announcement  by  Honda  of  South  Carolina  Manufacturing,  Inc.  (HSC)  located  in  the Sixth  Congressional  District,  to  expand  its  current  all-terrain  vehicle  (ATV)  plant  in Timmonsville,  South  Carolina.  On  January  21, 2000, HSC  broke  ground  on  a  new  $20 million engine  manufacturing  operation.  The  new  expansion  will  allow  HSC  to  produce  an  engine currently  made  in  Japan  and  will  lead  to  the hiring of an additional 200 associates. HSC  began  ATC  production  in  July  1998. The  expansion  will  increase  Honda\u2019s  total  investment  in  HSC  to  more  than  $70  million. When  the  new  engine  operation  reaches  full capacity  in  2001,  HSC  will  have  an  annual production  capacity  of  150,000  ATV\u2019s  and  engines and will employ approximately 625 associates.  Construction  of  the  50,000  square  foot expansion  for  engine  machining  and  casting will  begin  immediately  and  will  be  completed by  late  summer.  Upon  completion,  the  plant will  total 330,000  square  feet. Honda\u2019s  ATV  sales  in  America  grew  more than  20%  in  1999.  In  addition,  20%  of  the products  manufactured  at  HSC  are  exported to  overseas  markets  including  Australia,  New Zealand, and  the United Kingdom. Mr.  Speaker,  please  join  with  me  in  saluting Honda  of  South  Carolina  Manufacturing,  Inc. on  their  newest  expansion.  The  Sixth  Congressional  District  and  the  State  of  South Carolina  are  grateful  for Honda\u2019s  investment  in our  State  and  look  forward  to  a  long  and  prosperous business partnership. \u0001 PERSONAL  EXPLANATION HON.

CHRISTOPHER  H.  SMITH OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 15, 2000 Mr.  SMITH  of  New  Jersey.  Mr.  Speaker,  in October  of  last  year,  I  expressed  concerns  in this Chamber on  the  condition of democracy  in Croatia.  At  that  time,  the  leadership  of  Croatia was  resisting  the  transition  towards  free  elections,  stalling  the  construction  of  democratic institutions,  flaunting  the  rule  of  law,  and squashing  ethnic  diversity.  Those  that  held power  were  maintaining  it  in  two  significant ways.  The  first  was  through  the  manipulation of  the  political  system  to  their  advantage,  including,  in  particular,  efforts  to  control  the media  and  the  unwillingness  to  allow  free  and fair  elections.  Second,  there  was  heavy  reliance  on  nationalist  passions  for  support.  Zagreb\u2019s  policies  swayed  the  loyalties  of  Croats in  neighboring  Bosnia  and  made  it  difficult  for the  displaced  Serb  population  to  return  to  the country. Since  last  October,  things  have  changed drastically  and  for  the  better.  In  the  Parliamentary  election  of  January  3,  the  desire  of  the people  for  change  was  manifested  as  the party  that  had  ruled  since  the  fall  of  communism  was  defeated  by  an  opposition  coalition  led  by  the  new  Prime  Minister,  Ivica Racan.  Meanwhile,  in  a  special  presidential election  on  February  7  to  succeed  the  late Franjo  Tudjman,  Stipe Mesic  won  on  promises of  reform,  of  a  more  democratic  political  system  with  diminished  power  for  the  presidency, of  greater  cooperation  with  The  Hague  in  the prosecution  of  war  criminals,  of  progress  in the  implementation  of  the  Dayton  Accords  in Bosnia,  and  of  the  return  of  Croatia\u2019s  displaced  Serb  population.  These  changes  have been  universally  applauded,  specifically  by Secretary  of  State  Madeleine  Albright  during her  visit  to  Croatia  on  February  2.  In  fact,  Mr. Speaker,  I  join  the  Secretary  of  State  in  commending  the  new  policies  of  Croatia\u2019s  leaders, and  I  compliment  our  able  Ambassador  to Croatia,  William  Montgomery,  for  his  role  in pressing  for democratic  change. Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  good  that  Croatia\u2019s  new leadership  is  talking  about  substantial  reform. However,  we  must  be  sure  that  it  is  not  just talk. We must  be  sure  to  encourage  Croatia  to move  closer  towards  full  freedom,  true  justice, and  greater  prosperity  for  all  of  her  citizens, regardless  of  ethnicity.  We  must  continue  to press  for  the  surrender  to  The  Hague  of  those indicted  for  war  crimes.  As  we  do,  we must  be ready  to  support  Croatia,  even  as  we  have been  ready  to  criticize  Croatia\u2019s  shortcomings in  the  past.  Recent  violence  in  southeastern Europe  underscores  the  need  for  true  democracy  in  the  region. In  closing,  I  congratulate Croatia\u2019s new  leadership  and  its  promise  of  progress.  Now  that reform  is  on  the  horizon,  I  am  hopeful  that Croatia  will  soon  be  an  integrated  partner  in European affairs. \u0001 PERSONAL  EXPLANATION HON.  ROD  R.

MICHAEL  BILIRAKIS OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ALLARD Tuesday, February 15, 2000 Mr.  BILIRAKIS.  Mr.  Speaker,  today  I  am  introducing  the Ombudsman Reauthorization Act of  2000.  This  legislation  is  a  companion  to  S. 1763,  which  was  introduced  last  year  by  Senator  of  Colorado.  The  bill  reauthorizes the  Office  of  the  National  Solid  Waste  and Superfund  Ombudsman  within  the  U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency. I  have  experienced  first-hand  the  important work  of  the  National  Superfund  Ombudsman in  connection  with  the  Stauffer  Chemical Superfund  Site,  which  is  located  in  my  congressional district  in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I  fought  tirelessly  with  my  constituents  for years  to  have  the  Stauffer  site  designated  as a  federal  Superfund  site.  In  1994,  the  Stauffer site  was  finally  included  on  the  National  Priorities  List.  It  has  been  a  long  and  tedious  process  since  then.  After  six  years,  we  are  still waiting  for  the  cleanup  to  begin.  Clearly,  this process  is  taking  too  long.  The  Supefund  program  must  be  streamlined  to  make  it  work within  reasonable  time  frames\u2014consistent with public expectations. All  of  my  constituents  agree  on  the  need  for prompt  cleanup  of  the  Stauffer  site.  The  question  is  how  and  when  this  will  be  accomplished  in  a  manner  consistent  with  protecting the public health and  safety. I  joined  with  many  of  my  constituents  in  repeatedly  urging  the  EPA  to  carefully  consider the  unique  geography  of  the  Tarpon  Springs area,  with  a  particular  focus  on  our  sources  of drinking  water.  In  1996,  I  was  pleased  to  help secure  funding  for  the  Pinellas  and  Pasco County  Technical  Assistance  Grant  (Pi-PaTAG)  to  monitor  cleanup  activities  at  the Stauffer  site.  Throughout  the  years,  I  have sponsored  several  public  meetings  and  written many  letters  regarding  necessary  standards for  the  cleanup of  the  site. The  process  of  selecting  a  remedy  that  is both  cost-effective  and  protective  of  the  public health  and  safety  has  been  extremely  difficult. The affected parties have different opinions  regarding  the  most  appropriate  solution  to  the that problem,  and  many  area  residents  feel  they have been  \u2018\u2018shut out\u2019\u2019 of  the process. Mr.  Speaker,  if  anyone  deserves  to  have their  voice  heard  in  the  debate  on  cleanup  of a  hazardous  waste  site,  it  should  be  the  local citizens  who  live  in  the  surrounding  neighborhoods. At  my  request,  the  National  Superfund  Ombudsman,  Robert  Martin,  has  launched  an independent  review  of  the  EPA\u2019s  proposed cleanup  plan  for  the  Stauffer  site.  To  date, Mr. Martin  has  participated  in  two  public  meetings I  have  sponsored, which were  held  on December 2, 1999, and February 12, 2000. These  discussions  have  provided  an  opportunity  for  local  residents,  technical  experts, Stauffer  company  representatives, and  federal, state  and  local  officials  to  express  their  concerns  directly  to  the  Ombudsman.  The  Ombudsman  is  continuing  to  gather  additional  information  and  will  not  make  recommendations until  the  investigation  is  completed. During  the  course  of  the  public  meetings,  it has  become  apparent  that  certain hydrogeological  issues  were  not  addressed before  the  proposed  cleanup  plan  was  advanced  by  the Stauffer Management Company and  the  EPA.  For  example,  no  studies  regarding  the  possibility  of  sinkholes  were  conducted prior  to  the  proposal  of  the  remedy  outlined  in the  Record  of  Decision.  Because  of  Florida\u2019s unique  environment,  sinkholes  pose  a  serious concern  for  the  residents  of  the  surrounding community.  If  contaminated  soil  collapses  into the  groundwater,  more  than  30  contaminants could  be  introduced  into  the  area\u2019s  drinking water  supply. The  effect  of  contaminants  from  the  site  on local  groundwater  is  an  issue  that  demands further  scrutiny.  There  has  been  conflicting evidence  regarding  the  direction  of  groundwater  flow,  and  it  is  critical  that  more  comprehensive  studies  be  undertaken  to  identify the potential  for groundwater  contamination. Mr.  Speaker,  without  the  involvement  of  the Ombudsman,  my  constituents\u2019  concerns  about sinkholes  and  groundwater  would  not  have  received  the attention  they deserve. My  constituents  have  welcomed  the  Ombudsman\u2019s  participation  in  discussions  about the  proposed  cleanup  plan.  Many  of  them have  renewed  confidence  that  their  concerns will  be  seriously  considered  in  this  process. The  Ombudsman  has  been  their  advocate, giving  a  voice  to  those  who  might  otherwise have  limited  input  in  the  design  of  a  remedy for  the  site. The  Ombudsman  has  worked  effectively and  aggressively  to  uncover  the  facts  surrounding  the  Stauffer  site,  as  well  as  other Superfund  sites  around  the  nation.  In  fact,  he has  been  so  successful  that  EPA  officials  are considering  eliminating  his  office.  This  cannot be  allowed  to  occur.  Without  the  Ombudsman\u2019s  investigation  of  the  Stauffer  site,  the residents  of  Tarpon  Springs  would  have  been left  in  the  dark  and  without  a  voice.  I  applaud the  Ombudsman  for  his  advocacy  on  their  behalf  and  for  bringing  integrity  back  into  the process. The  Ombudsman  Reauthorization  Act  will ensure  that  the  Ombudsman  is  allowed  to continue  his  critical  work.  This  bill  reauthorizes the  office  for  ten  years,  allowing  the  Ombudsman  to  carry  on  the  fact-finding  investigations that  lead  to  better  solutions  for  communities burdened with Superfund  sites. Mr.  Speaker,  our  constituents  benefit  enormously  from  the  advocacy  efforts  of  the  National  Superfund  Ombudsman.  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  cosponsor  and  support  passage  of this  important  legislation. \u0001 TRIBUTE  TO  GENERAL  TILELLI,  JR. JOHN  H. HON.  IKE  SKELTON OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 15, 2000 Mr.  SKELTON.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to congratulate  and  pay  tribute  to  Gen.  John  H. Tilelli,  Jr.,  who  retired  from  the  U.S.  Army  on January  31,  2000,  after  more  than  33  years  of exemplary  service. General  Tilelli  was  raised  in  Holmdel,  NJ.  A 1963  graduate  of  Pennsylvania  Military  College,  he  received  a  bachelor\u2019s  degree  in  economics  and  was  commissioned  as  an  armor officer.  He  attended  the  armor  officer  basic and  advanced  courses  and  Airborne  School. General  Tilelli  is  also  a  1974  graduate  of  the U.S.  Marine  Corps  Command  and  Staff  College  and  completed  the  U.S.  Army  War  College  in  1983.  He  received  a  master\u2019s  degree in  education  administration  from  Lehigh  University  in  1972.  Widener  University  awarded him  an  honorary  doctorate  in  business  management  in  1996  and  the  University  of  Maryland  presented  him with  an  honorary  doctorate in  law  in 1997. General  Tilelli  saw  combat  in  two  wars  during  his  career.  In  Vietnam,  he  served  as  the company  commander,  18th  Engineer  Brigade and  as  the  district  senior  advisor,  Advisory Team  84.  During  Desert  Shield  and  Desert Storm,  General  Tilelli  was  the  commanding general, 1st Cavalry Division. In  other  assignments,  General  Tilelli  served in  the  3d  Battalion,  77th  Armor,  Fort  Devens, MA.  He  also  held  positions  in  the  2d  Armored Cavalry  Regiment,  the  11th  Armored  Cavalry Regiment,  and  then  1st  Armored  Division while  stationed  in  Germany.  Additionally,  he had  the  opportunity  to  mentor  future  soldiers as  an  assistant  professor  of  military  science, Lafayette  College,  PA,  and  shared  his  technical  expertise  during  a  tour  at  the  U.S.  Army Armor School, Fort Knox, KY. General  Tilelli  commanded  the  Seventh Army  Training  Command  and  Combat  Maneuver Training Center  in Germany before assuming  command  of  the  1st Cavalry Division.  After that,  he  served  in  the  Pentagon  as  the  Assistant  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Operations  and Plans,  then  as  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Operations  and  Plans.  After  his  promotion  to  general,  he  served  as  Vice  Chief  of  Staff  of  the Army  before  assuming  command  of U.S. Army Forces Command. General  Tilelli  then  became the  Commander  of  the  United  Nations  Command,  Republic  of  Korea/United  States  Combined  Forces  Command  and  United  States Forces Korea. General  Tilelli  made  monumental  contributions  and  improvements  to  the  United  States and  Republic  of  Korea  military  coalition  and vastly  improved  its  ability  to  deter  and  defend against  attack.  He  also  served  as  a  vital  link between  the  United  States  and  the  civilian government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  proving to  be  one  of  the  Army\u2019s  most  successful  diplomats.  His  political  and  military  expertise  resulted  in  the  right  application  and  employment of  forces  to  ultimately  deescalate  the  rising VerDate 27<JAN>2000 03:08 Feb 16, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\A15FE8.038 pfrm08 PsN: E15PT1 ",

But  when information  is  being  sent  out  about changes  in  national  time  or  announcements concerning time, this ninth time zone,  in  geography  going west  but  first in  terms  of  time,  frequently  gets  ignored.  After  all,  the  existing  law  only allows  for  eight  time  zones  under  the American flag. Consequently,  Madam  Speaker,  I  am introducing  today  a  bill which  fills  the void, which corrects this oversight, and which  appropriately  designates  each and  every  American  time  zone.  If  all Americans  count,  then  all  Americans should  be  included  in  time,  in  political participation,  and  in  the  national  census.  Each  and  every  time  we  look  at the  clock  or  look  at  our  watch,  we should  recognize  that  there  exists  nine time zones. b 1245 The  unique  feature  of  this  particular piece  of  legislation  is  that  it  is  responsive  to  a  quandary  that  does  not  quite exist  in  the  other  time  zones.  We  have two  jurisdictions  with  two  distinct names. We have Guam and we have the Northern  Marianas.  We  could  call  it the  Guam  slash  or  dash Marianas  time zone.  However,  in  time,  Guam  would take  center  stage  and  the  remainder  of the  Marianas  would  be  ignored.  Or  we could  call  it  the  Marianas  time  zone, but  that  would  be  taken  as  a  signal that Guam is not included. Therefore,  in  honor  of  the  historical unity  of  both  Guam  and  the  Northern Marianas  and  the  people  who  were  the original  inhabitants  of  the  entire  island  chain,  I  have  designated  in  this legislation  this  new  time  zone  as Chamorro  Standard  Time.  The  word \u2018\u2018Chamorro\u2019\u2019  refers  to  the  indigenous people,  possesses  a  proud  cultural  heritage, and forms the basis of the underlying  historical  and  cultural  connection  between  the  people  of  Guam  and the  people  of  Luta,  Tinian,  Saipan, Agrigan,  and  other  islands  in  the Northern Marianas. ManChamorro ham todu gi tinituhon. We were Chamorros in the beginning. ManChamorro  ham  esta  pa\u2019go.  We are still Chamorros today. This  amendment  to  the  Calder  Act has  been  discussed  with  Federal  officials  in  NIST  of  the  Department  of Commerce, and we anticipate only support for this effort. Madam  Speaker,  I  ask  all  of  my  colleagues  to  cosponsor  and  pass  this  legislation  quickly,  dare  I  say  it,  in  a timely way. Let us not waste any time. Let  us  take  the  time  to make  time  for all Americans. f The  BIGGERT).  ELIMINATION  OF  MARRIAGE  PENALTY SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mrs. Under  the  Speaker\u2019s  announced  policy  of  January  19,  1999,  the gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  is  recognized  during  morning  bates for 5 minutes. WELLER) TAX hour  deMr. WELLER. Madam Speaker, today is  a  big  day.  The  House  Committee  on Ways  and Means  is  going  to  act  on  another  item  on  our  agenda,  an  issue  of fairness;  and  today,  in  the  House  Committee  on  Ways  and  Means,  we  are going  to  move  forward  on  an  item  on the  Republican  agenda  which  helps 800,000  senior  citizens,  senior  citizens over  the  age  of  65,  who  because  they need  to  work  or  want  to  work,  they want  to  be  active  longer,  or  maybe they  have  two  pensions,  had  their  Social  Security  benefits  taxed  away.  And that is called the earnings limit, or the earnings penalty. Today  we  are  going  to  pass  legislation  which  will  wipe  out  that  unfair quirk  in  Federal  law  which  taxes  away two-thirds  of  the  Social  Security  benefits of 800,000 senior citizen who happen to earn more than $17,000 a year. We  can  all  think  of  seniors  that  we know  in  our  local  communities  who have  to  work,  maybe  they  are  waitresses,  maybe  they  work  or  have  a  little hobby or they set aside some money and  saved  and  invested  well  that  they are  making  more  than  $17,000  a  year, and  today  they  are  punished;  they  are penalized. We  are  going  to  pass  legislation which  deserves  bipartisan  support which  wipes  out  the  earnings  limit  for 800,000 senior citizens. That is a big victory as we work to bring about fairness to every American. Today  I  want  to  talk  about  another issue  of  fairness,  an  issue  which  this House  has  voted  to  address,  an  issue which  responds  to  a  fundamental  question  of  fairness,  the  difference  between right and wrong; and that is, is it right, is  it  fair  that  under  our  Tax  Code  25 million married working couples on average  pay  $1,400  more  in  higher  taxes just because they are married? Is  it  right  that  a  working  married couple  with  an  identical  income,  identical  circumstances,  pays  higher  taxes than  a  couple  that  lives  together  outside  of  marriage  with  identical  circumstances? Of course not. It  is wrong; it  is  unfair  that  under  our  Tax  Code  a working  married  couple  pays  more  in taxes just because they are married. I want  to  introduce  to my  colleagues in  the  House  Shad  and  Michelle Hallihan,  two  public  school  teachers from  Joliet,  Illinois.  Shad  and Michelle,  of  course,  teach  public school;  they  just  had  a  little  baby,  a young  couple,  a  nice  couple.  They  suffer  the  marriage  tax  penalty  just  because they are married. They  have  a  combined  income  of about  $62,000.  They  are  two  public school  teachers  supposed  to  have  identical  incomes  of  about  $30,000  each. They  are  middle  class.  Well,  they  pay the average marriage tax penalty. Michelle  pointed  out  to me,  she  said, Congressman, as you work to eliminate that  marriage  tax  penalty,  let  your colleagues  in  the  Congress  know  that that  marriage  tax  penalty  that  the Hallihans  pay  would  buy  about  4,000 diapers for their newborn child. It  is  real  money  for  real  people.  And for  other  families  in  Joliet,  Illinois, the  hometown  of  Michelle  and  Shad Hallihan,  that  $1,400,  the  average  marriage  tax  penalty,  is  1  year\u2019s  tuition  at Joliet  Junior  College  or  a  local  community  college.  It  is  3  months\u2019  of  daycare  at  a  local  childcare  center  in  the south  suburbs  of  Chicago.  It  is  7 months\u2019  worth  of  car  payments.  It  is  a washer  and  a  dryer  for  couples  like Michelle  and  Shad.  And  they  are  a beautiful couple. They are young. But  the  marriage  tax  penalty  is  suffered  by  the  elderly,  as  well.  We  have all heard  the  stories  about  elderly  couples who get divorced because  they can save  money.  Well,  the  marriage  tax penalty punishes young and old just because they are married. And this House has  done  something  about  that.  We have been working over the last several years to wipe out the marriage tax penalty.  And  230  Members  of  this  House joined together to cosponsor H.R. 6, the Marriage Tax Elimination Act,  legislation  which  wipes  out  the  marriage  tax penalty  for  couples  like  Michelle  and Shad Hallihan. I  am  proud  to  say  that  this  House voted,  in  fact 48 Democrats  joined with every House Republican to vote to wipe out  the  marriage  tax  penalty,  benefiting  25 million married, working  couples  who  suffer  the  marriage  tax penalty. Our  legislation  will  essentially  wipe out  the  marriage  tax  penalty  for  Shad and Michelle Hallihan. We  do  it  in  several  ways.  It  has  three  key  components.  It  is  legislation  designed  to help everybody who suffers the marriage tax penalty,  and  we  do  it  in  three approaches. One  is,  first  we  help  the  working poor.  Those  who  participate  in  the earned  income  credit,  which  helps those  working  poor  families,  particularly  with  children,  well,  there  is  a marriage  penalty  and we  adjust  the  income  threshold  so  that  working,  married  couples  who  participate  in  earned income  credit  will  see  their  marriage penalty eliminated. Let  us  remember  that  the  biggest part  of  the  marriage  tax  penalty  is caused  when  we  have  a  husband  and wife  like  Shad  and  Michelle  Hallihan, who,  because  they  are  married,  they file jointly, they combine their income. We  eliminate  the marriage  tax  penalty by widening  the  15  percent  tax  bracket as well as doubling the standard deduction. The  Senate  needs  to  act.  I  hope  the Senate will join us and move in a quick way,  a  timely  way,  and  in  a  bipartisan way  to  join  us  in  wiping  out  the  marriage tax penalty. f IMPROVING  BUDGET  PROCESS\u2014 KEEPING  SOCIAL  SECURITY  AND MEDICAID  SOLVENT The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.

First sworn  in  at  the  91st  Congress,  Congressman  Stokes  served  15  consecutive terms  in  the  United  States  House  of Representatives.  When  he  retired  at the  end  of  the  105th  Congress,  he  became  the  first African American  in  the history  of  the  United  States  Congress to  retire  having  completed  30  years  in office. In the 105th Congress, Representative Stokes  was  a  member  of  the  Committee  on  Appropriations  where,  by virtue  of  his  seniority,  he  was  the third-ranking  minority  member  of  the full  committee  and  the  ranking minority  member  of  the  Subcommittee  on VA, HUD  and  Independent Agencies.  In addition,  he  served  as  a member  of  the Subcommittee  on  Labor,  Health  and Human Services and Education. He  was  the  ninth  Ranking  Democratic  Member  of  Congress.  By  virtue of  his  seniority,  Congressman  Stokes also  served  as  the  Dean  of  the  Ohio Congressional  Delegation.  He  is  also  a founding  member  of  the  Congressional Black  Caucus  and  chaired  the  CBC Health Braintrust. He  was  born  February  23,  1925  in Cleveland, Ohio to the  late Charles and Louise Stokes. His  father  died when he was  a  young  boy  and  Louis  and  his brother,  the  late  Ambassador  Carl  B. Stokes,  were  reared  by  their  young widowed mother. Stokes was educated in the Cleveland public  schools,  graduating  from  Central  High  School.  Following  3  years  in the  United  States  Army,  from  1943  to 1946,  he  returned  to  Cleveland  and  utilized the G.I. bill to attend Western Reserve  University.  He  received  his  Doctor of Laws degree from Cleveland Marshall Law School in 1953. Prior  to  his  election  to  the  United States  Congress,  Congressman  Stokes practiced  law  for  14 years  in Cleveland. He  was  chief  trial  counsel  for  the  firm of  Stokes,  Character,  Terry,  Perry, Whitehead,  Young  and  Davidson.  As  a practicing  lawyer,  Representative Stokes  participated  in  three  cases  in the  United  States  Supreme  Court,  including  the  landmark  \u2018\u2018stop  and  frisk\u2019\u2019 case of Terry versus Ohio. Congressman  Stokes\u2019  younger  brother,  the  late  Carl  B.  Stokes,  made  history in 1967 when he was elected mayor of  Cleveland,  serving  with  distinction as  the  first  black  mayor  of  a  major American  city.  Carl  Stokes  also  enjoyed  a  career  as  an  award-winning broadcaster and municipal court  judge. In  1994,  he  was  appointed  by  President Bill  Clinton  as U.S. Ambassador  to  the Republic  of  Seychelles.  Ambassador Stokes died in April 1996. Louise  Stokes,  a  proud  mother  who always  encouraged  her  sons  to  get  an education, lived to witness many of her sons\u2019  historic  achievements.  Prior  to her death  in  1978,  she was  the  recipient of  numerous  awards,  including  Cleveland\u2019s  \u2018\u2018Woman  of  the  Year\u2019\u2019  award  in 1968  and  Ohio\u2019s  \u2018\u2018Mother  of  the  Year\u2019\u2019 award in 1969. Let  us  talk  a  little  bit  about  Congressman  Louis  Stokes\u2019  congressional career.  In  his  first  term  in  public  office, he served as a member of the Committee  on  Education  and  Labor  in  the House,  Committee  on  un-American Activities,  later  renamed  the House  Committee on Internal Security. In  his  second  term,  he  was  appointed the first African American to sit on the Committee  on  Appropriations  in  the House.  On  February  8,  1972,  Louis Stokes  was  elected  as  the  chairman  of the  Congressional  Black  Caucus.  He served two consecutive terms. In  addition  to  his  seat  on  the  powerful  Committee  on  Appropriations,  on February  5,  1975,  he  was  elected  by  the Democratic  Caucus  to  serve  on  the newly  formed  House  Committee  on Budget.  He  was  re-elected  to  the  Committee on Budget twice, serving a total of 6 years. On  September  21,  1976,  Representative  Stokes  was  appointed  by  Speaker Carl  Albert  to  serve  on  the  House  Select  Committee  on  Assassinations.  The committee  had  a  mandate  to  conduct an  investigation  and  study  of  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  deaths  of President  John  F.  Kennedy  and  Dr. Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.  On  March  8, 1977,  Speaker  Thomas  P.  O\u2019Neill  appointed  Congressman  Stokes  as  chairman  of  this  committee.  On  December 31,  1978,  Congressman  Stokes  completed these historic investigations and filed with the House of Representatives 27  volumes  of  hearings,  a  final  report, and  recommendations  for  administrative and legislative reform. In  February  of  1980,  in  the  96th  Congress,  Congressman  Stokes  was  appointed  by  Speaker  O\u2019Neill  to  the House Committee on Standards of Official  Conduct,  also  known  as  the Ethics Committee. In the 97th, 98th, and 102nd Congresses, he was elected chairman of this  committee.  Also,  in  the  101st  Congress,  Representative  Stokes  was  appointed  by  Speaker  Wright  to  serve  on the Ethics Task Force. In  February  of  1983,  the  98th  Congress,  Representative  Stokes  was  appointed  by  Speaker  O\u2019Neill  to  the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.  In the 99th Congress, Representative  Stokes  was  elected  chairman  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Program and  Budget Authorization  for  the  committee.  In  January  of  1987,  the  100th Congress,  House  Speaker  Jim  Wright appointed  Congressman  Stokes  as chairman  of  the  Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence. In the 100th Congress,  Representative  Stokes  was also  appointed  to  serve  on  the  House Select  Committee  to  Investigate  Covert  Arms  Transactions  with  Iran,  and the Pepper Commission  on Comprehensive Health Care. As a  result of  the  1990 census and  the redistricting  mandate  in  1992,  the  21st Congressional  District  of  Ohio  was  redesignated  as  the  11th  Congressional District.  In  the  103rd  Congress,  which commenced  in  January  of  1993,  Congressman  Stokes  was  elected  to  chair the  House  Committee  on  Appropriations  Subcommittee  on  VA,  HUD  and Independent  Agencies.  He  also  served as  a  member  of  the  Subcommittee  on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education,  and  the  Subcommittee  on the District of Columbia. Congressman  Stokes  is  married  to Jeanette (Jay) Stokes. He has children: Shelley,  Angela,  Louis,  and  Lorene. Angela  is  an  elected  official  in  Cleveland  in  the  Cleveland  municipal  court. Shelley  and  Louis  C.  are  both  involved in  broadcasting,  one  in  New  York  and the other in Michigan. He  has  several  grandchildren. He  is  a graduate  of  the  Cleveland  public schools,  Case-Western  Reserve  University, and Cleveland Marshall College of Law  where  he  received  his  doctor  of law. He  has  been  given  numerous  designations  and  honors,  among  them,  the  100 Most  Influential  Black  Americans/ Black  Achievement  Award.  The  Louis Stokes Bridge was  named  in  his  honor, which is a bridge over Lake Shore Boulevard  over Euclid Creek; Louis Stokes Telecommunications  Center/Cuyahoga Community  College;  the  Central  High School  Hall  of  Fame;  the  Louis  Stokes Community  Center;  the  Louis  Stokes Wing  of  the  Cleveland  Public  Library. A  street  is  called  Stokes  Boulevard  in the  city  of  Cleveland  named  after  him and  his  brother.  There  is  a  Louis Stokes Health Sciences Center at CaseWestern Reserve University. There  is  a Louis  Stokes  HUD  Hall  of  Fame.  He has  been  given  the  award  by  the  National  Minority  Transplant  Hall  of Fame.  There  is  a  Louis  Stokes  Head Start  Day  Care  Center.  There  is  a Stokes  Rapid  Transit  Station  in Windermere.  There  is  a  Louis  Stokes Health  Sciences  Library  at  Howard University. There  is a Stokes Web  site. There  is  a  Stokes  Family  Library and  Museum,  which  is  housed  at  the Cuyahoga  Metropolitan  Housing  Authority  in  the area where Congressman Stokes  grew  up  as  a  boy.  There  is  a Louis  Stokes  Cleveland  Department  of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. There is  a  Louis  Stokes  building  at  the  National Institutes of Health. He  has  received  more  than  23  honorary degrees from colleges and universities across this country. I  would  like  to  particularly  personally  pay  tribute  to  Congressman  Louis Stokes.  It  is  through  his  support  and encouragement  that  I  stand  here  on the  floor  of  the  House  of  Representatives  today.  I  can  only  recall  with great  admiration  all  of  the  wonderful things  that he did on my behalf and on behalf  of  the  11th  Congressional  District.

The  stakes  are  the  same,  and  failure  is not an option. That\u2019s why this holiday and  what  it\u2019s  about  are  vitally  important, not  just  to  African-Americans  but  to  all Americans. Last  spring,  I  went  with my  colleague  and friend,  John  Lewis,  on  a  pilgrimage  to Selma, and to Birmingham and Montgomery. We  prayed  in  the  church  in  Birmingham, where  the  lives of  four girls were  cruelly  cut short  by  dynamite,  exploded  in  the  midst  of a  Sunday  morning  worship.  We  sat  in  the pews  at  Dexter  Avenue  Baptist  Church,  and listened  to  Dr.  King  tell  his  congregation during  the  bus  boycott:  \u2018\u2018The  tension  in  this city  is  not  between  white  people  and  black people.  The  tension  is,  at  bottom,  between justice  and  injustice,  between  the  forces  of light and  the  forces of darkness.\u2019\u2019 and on  the anniversary  of  Bloody  Sunday,  we  marched, arm-in-arm,  across  the  Edmund  Pettus Bridge. On  the  way  back,  a  reporter  asked  why  I had  made  the  trip,  and  I  told  him  I  thought everyone  should  come  to  Birmingham  and Selma.  Everyone  should  know  the  Edmund Pettus  Bridge  as  well  as  Concord  Bridge  in Massachusetts;  and  everyone  should  know what happened  in Kelly-Ingram Park  as well as what happened on Lexington Green. If  you  fast  forward  thirty-five  years  from LBJ\u2019s  speech,  you  have  to  say we  have  come a  long  way.  Dr.  King\u2019s  mission  is  far  from finished;  but  that  doesn\u2019t  make  the  accomplishments  of  the  civil  rights movement  any less momentous. We  should not  let  ourselves or  our  children  diminish  what  was  achieved in  the  50\u2019s,  60\u2019s,  and  70\u2019s,  or  say  that  race  relations are no better now than then. We grew up  in  the  segregated South. We know  better. And  besides, we  have  to  remember  how  far we\u2019ve  come  because  it  inspires  us  to  keep going. We should remember Philip Randolph, telling  the  Judiciary  Committee  that  \u2018\u2018when Negro Americans travel the highways of this country,  we  are  stalked  by  humiliation.\u2019\u2019 And remember how Rosa Parks, a seamstress in Montgomery, helped put an end to that indignity.  When  we  think  there  is  little  we  as ordinary  citizens  can  do,  heroines  like  Rosa Parks remind us we are wrong. They  remind  us  also  that  Martin  Luther King,  Jr.  would  have  accomplished  little  or nothing,  but  for  those who  stood  behind  him and  those  who  charged  ahead,  as  shock troops of  the movement. They were ordinary Americans  like  Dub  Massey  and  Jim  Wells and  the  Friendship  Nine.  But  it  was,  in  Dr. King\u2019s  words,  \u2018\u2018their  sublime  courage,  their willingness  to  suffer,  their  amazing  discipline in the midst of almost inhuman provocation\u2019\u2019 that gave us the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Among  the  early  protesters  was  a  young woman  named  Diane  Nash,  an  organizer  of SNCC.  At  the  time  of  the  Rock  Hill  sit-ins, SNCC was in dire financial straits, and meeting  to  discuss  how  they  could  keep  going. One  of  the  Friendship  protesters,  Tom Gaither,  used  the  single  phone  call  allowed him  at  the  jail  to  call  SNCC  collect  in  Atlanta.  Gaither  called  to  tell  SNCC  that  the Friendship  students  didn\u2019t  want  bail  and wouldn\u2019t  be  asking  SNCC  for  bond  money. They  were  going  to  serve  out  their  thirty days  in  jail. This became a precedent  for  the whole movement,  and  so  inspired  SNCC  that four of those at the meeting in Atlanta drove to Rock Hill,  sat-in at McCrory\u2019s, and  joined the Friendship Nine in the county jail. Diane  Nash  was  among  them,  and  today, she  issues  us  a  caveat.  She  says  that  \u2018\u2018the movement  made  Martin  rather  than  Martin making the movement.\u2019\u2019 She says this not to diminish Dr. King, but so that \u2018\u2018young people will  not  think  that  this  was  his  movement, and say  \u2018I wish we had a Martin Luther King today  to  lead  us  . . .  If  people know  how  the movement  started  and  why  it  succeeded,\u2019\u2019 says  Diane  Nash,  \u2018\u2018they  will  be  more  likely to  ask  the  right  question,  which  is:  \u2018What can I do?\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Every  community  needs  stories  of  sublime courage,  discipline,  and  principle  like  these. These  are  our  epic  poems,  and  we  should  be telling them and teaching them because they build  respect;  they  show  us  we  are  stronger than we think; they inspire our better selves. Those  who  want  to  keep  the  Confederate flag  flying  over  our  Capitol  claim  it  as  their heritage. But  Confederate  veterans  served  in the  General  Assembly  from  1866  to  the  early 1920s,  and  never  resolved  to  raise  their  old battle  flag  over  the  dome  of  the  Capitol.  If we want to preserve our heritage, what about the motherlode of heritage in the civil rights movement?  In  a  country  where  there  is  too much  violence  in  the  home,  in  the  schools, on  the  streets,  here  is  a  rich  history  of  nonviolence worth our study. Every  school  child  in  South  Carolina should  know  stories  like  these.  They  should know  the  story  of  those  black  children  in Clarendon  County  who  walked  miles  to school every day, as busses full of white children  passed  them  by.  They  should  not  study South  Carolina  history  without  learning  the name  of Levi Briggs  and  those  brave  parents who put their lives on the line to correct this inequity,  and  went  on  to  the  Supreme  Court with Briggs v. Elliott. They should know the twisted  road  to  school  integration  and  the quiet  heroes,  like  Matthew  Perry  and  Judge Waring, who helped clear the way. We should teach character, teach it by telling  the  stories  of  Rosa  Parks  and  Levi Briggs, John Lewis, and the Friendship Nine. And while we are at it, we should preach persistence,  to  our  children  and  ourselves.  For one of our country\u2019s virtues has been our capacity  to  struggle  endlessly  with  our  problems,  and  never  be  completely  satisfied with our  solutions. We  have  to keep  seeking  solutions; and even if we never see closure, never give  up  in  the  search  for  a  society  that matches  our  ideals  and  principles.  In  the realm of racial justice and equality, progress has  been  slow,  and  it  has  been  uneven,  but we have not  just been spinning our wheels  in a rut of racism. We have made progress. Look,  for  instance,  at  the  difference  the Voting  Rights  Act  has  made.  Take  the  Congress.  In  1965,  John  Lewis  was  spearheading SNCC,  in  the  streets  protesting.  Today  he  is in  the  Congress,  Chief  Deputy  Whip  on  the Democratic side. He serves there alongside 38 other  African-Americans,  Jim  Clyburn among  them,  the  first  black  elected  to  Congress from South Carolina since 1896. Charlie Rangel of New York is another; if Democrats gain  control  of  the  House  in  the  next  election, Charlie will take the chair of the House Ways  and  Means  Committee,  the  most  powerful committee in Congress. America  is  better  for  all Americans,  but  it is  still not what  it ought  to be; and old  symbols, like the flag flying over our Capitol, are too  much  to  be  dismissed  as  mere  \u2018\u2018vestiges of  the  past.\u2019\u2019  We  stand  on  the  doorstep  of America\u2019s  fourth  century,  three  hundred years from the day the first African slave set foot  on  this  soil,  and  we  cannot  say  this  is the country we want it to be. Dr. King  liked  to  say  that  he wanted more than  \u2018\u2018just  physical  proximity  with  no  spiritual  affinity.\u2019\u2019  He  wanted  a  country  where \u2018\u2018not  only  elbows  but  hearts  rub  together.\u2019\u2019 We  cannot  say  that  we  are  such  a  society, nor  can  we  say  that  we  will  become  one  by laissez-faire policies, benign neglect, or mere evolution. Martin Luther King, Jr. warned us years  ago  from  his  cell  in  the  Birmingham jail  that  \u2018\u2018human  progress  never  rolls  in  on wheels  of  inevitability.  It  comes  from  the tireless,  persistent  efforts  of  men  willing  to be co-workers with God. Now  that  we  have  reached  certain  goals,  I think we need a higher goal. Americans have always believed that we have, in the words of Franklin  D.  Roosevelt,  a  rendezvous  with destiny.  At  a  time  when  most  people  in  the world  lived  barely  above  the  level  of  animals,  Americans  showed  that  government  of the  people  is  the  only  government  for  the people.  We  showed  that  when  church  and state  are  separated,  both  fare  better.  We showed that when people  from countries  like Ireland  are  liberated  from  strife  and  prejudice,  they  thrive  in  a  tolerant  land.  We showed  that  free  education,  made  available to  all,  is  like  a  rising  tide;  it  lifts  all  the boats  in  a  society.  We  showed  that  people can  come  from  the  simplest  backgrounds, like Martin Luther King, Jr., the grandson of slaves  and  sharecroppers,  and  give  birth  to great things. Now  that  the  barriers  that  segregated  us have  been  removed,  our  challenge,  and  I think  God\u2019s  purpose  for  us,  is  to  show  the world\u2014from  Belfast  to  Bosnia,  from  Cape Town to East Timor, that different races and ethnic groups need not cripple and debilitate a  country;  they  can  make  a  country  richer and  stronger;  that  we  can  not  only  co-exist, but thrive on our differences. This  is  our  heritage,  and  it  should  be  our mission,  our  creed,  our  high  calling.  If  as  a people  we  can  embrace  this  goal,  we  can make our country  that  shining city on a hill that the Puritans set out to build three hundred years ago. We can make our country the country Martin Luther King, Jr. dreamed of, \u2018\u2018where  justice  rolls  down  like  waters  and righteousness like a mighty stream.\u2019\u2019 Our  goal  does  not  have  to  be  a  completely color-blind,  totally  homogenized  society. That\u2019s  too  utopian,  and  frankly,  I  think,  too bland.  I  think  our  richness  as  a  people  derives  from  our  differences.  I  think  it  is enough to strive for a plural, multi-racial society,  where  the  visible  differences  of  race, color, and culture no longer carry the stigma of  somehow  not  being  a  full-fledged  American. If  we  make  this  our  goal,  we  can  put  the flag  flying over our State Capitol  in perspective. It\u2019s a wedge issue, and we need to be rid of it, so that we can get on with far more important tasks, because time is running short. Halfway through this new century, our population  is  expected  to  hit  400  million.  Fiftythree percent will be white. Twenty-five percent  will  be  Hispanic,  14  percent  will  be black,  9  percent  Asian,  and  one  percent American  Indian.  Our  existence  as  a  people is  moving  toward  a  level  of  complexity  the world  has  never  seen  before.  In  the  21st  Century,  the  United  States  will  be  the  world\u2019s nation; the American canvass will be painted with colors from every shade of the earth. Surely,  we  do  not  want  this  racially  more diverse  America  to  be  a  racially  more  divided America. Surely,  we  want  the  world  to  look  to America in this century, as it did in the last, and  see  that  future  works,  see  many  races not  only  surviving  but  thriving,  richer  as  a culture  and  as  a  country  because  of  our  differences. Two  years  ago,  I  went  to  Bosnia  to  visit our  troops  in  a  forlorn  place,  ripped  asunder by  ethnic  warfare. When  I  landed  at  Tuzla,  I was  met  by  Major  General  Morgan,  an  African-American,  who  commanded  our  troops there. When I went to Sarajevo, I was met by General Shinseki, a Japanese-American, who commanded  the  entire  NATO  mission.  I doubt  that  any  racial  message  was  intended by  the  assignment  of  these  two  officers.

Mr.  WEINER.  Mr.  Speaker,  earlier this  month  the  Bay  News  in  Brooklyn had  this  headline  on  their  newspaper. It  says,  \u2018\u2018Get  Gil  In.  Brooklynites  Demand,  Put  Hodges  in  the  Hall  of Fame.\u2019\u2019 Well,  today,  the  veterans  committee of  major  league  baseball  announced, once  again,  that  Gil  Hodges  had  been passed over. This is an outrage. In  fact,  we  all  know  that  Gil  Hodges was  the  first  major  league  player  to ever hit four home runs in a game. And those of us who are Met fans know that he was the first Met to ever hit a home run  and,  of  course,  the  manager  of  the \u2018\u2018Miracle Mets\u2019\u2019 of 1969. But  even  the  casual  baseball  fan knows  that  Gil  Hodges  deserves  to  be in  the  Hall  of  Fame.  They  know  that he ranks 38 in home runs, with over 370; six  seasons  with  30-plus  home  runs.  He hit  twice,  more  than  40  home  runs.  He had  a  lifetime  slugging  percentage  of nearly  500,  and  nine  times  he  exceeded a  500  slugging  percentage.  He  was  a Gold  Glove  winner.  He  played  on  seven pennant  winners  and  two  World  Series champions. He was a hero to the people of Brooklyn  and  a  baseball  player  that  deserves to be in the Hall of Fame. The Bay News  said,  \u2018\u2018Get Gil  In.\u2019\u2019 All Brooklynites  agree.  The  Committee  on Veterans Affairs\u2019 should heed that call. f SPECIAL  ORDERS The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. PEASE).  Under  the  Speaker\u2019s  announced  policy  of  January  6,  1999,  and under  a  previous  order  of  the  House, the  following  Members  will  be  recognized for 5 minutes each. f FOR U.S.,  INDIA,  AND  CHINA:  TIME  NEW  RELATIONSHIP The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Under  a previous  order  of  the  House,  the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr.  PALLONE.  Mr.  Speaker,  in  the latter part of March, President Clinton is  scheduled  to  travel  to  India. His  trip will  mark  the  first  visit  by  an  American  President  to  the  world\u2019s  largest democracy  since  1978.  I  would  say  that a visit to India by the leader of the free world is long overdue, and I want to express my  appreciation  to  the President for making this historic trip. Mr.  Speaker,  my  purpose  evening  is  to  suggest  that  the  this President devote significant time during the trip  to  developing  closer  bilateral  cooperation  on  defense  and  security issues  to  respond  to  common  threats and  challenges.  This  is  an  area  where the need  for a U.S.-India partnership  is growing  increasingly  urgent. For  years we  have  seen  how  many  of  the  same forces  of  international  terrorism  that threaten  American  interests  also  pose a direct threat to India\u2019s security. Another  common  threat  faced  by India  and  the  United  States  emanates from the People\u2019s Republic of China. In the  last  week,  we  have  seen  China threatening  Taiwan  with  military force,  belying  Beijing\u2019s  claims  to  favor peaceful reunification. This is, unfortunately,  a  familiar  pattern.  U.S.  naval officials  in  the  Pacific  are  currently trying  to  defuse  the  situation,  and  the administration  is  obviously  concerned about  the  implications  that  Beijing\u2019s saber-rattling  will  have  in  a  variety  of areas.  In  this  House  just  a  few  weeks ago,  we  passed  the  Taiwan  Security Enhancement Act, which I supported. Mr.  Speaker,  I  believe  it  is  time  for the  United  States  to  stop  basing  so much  of  our Asia  policy  on  the  hope  of achieving  a  strategic  partnership  with China.  Instead,  I believe we  should  recognize  the  benefits  of  closer  defense ties  with  India,  a  country  which,  unlike  China,  is  a  democracy  and  which, also  in  contrast  to  China,  does  not threaten  its  neighbors  with  the  kinds of rhetoric and actions that Beijing has most  recently  demonstrated  with  regard to Taiwan. Toward  this  end,  President  Clinton\u2019s upcoming  trip  to  India  offers  an  opportunity  to  embark  upon  a  new  direction in  U.S.  policy  in  Asia.  It  is  an  opportunity  to  confront  the  threat  posed  by China  to  regional  and  independent  national  security  and  to  make  responses to this threat a higher priority. Mr.  Speaker,  India  faces  a  very  serious  threat  from  China.  The  two  countries  share a border of approximately a thousand miles.  In  the  1960s, China  initiated  a  border  war  against  India  and continues  to  occupy  Indian  territory. More recently, we have seen China providing missile development and nuclear technology  assistance  to  Pakistan  as well  as  other  unstable  regimes.  Pakistan,  a  country  currently  ruled  by military  dictatorship,  launched  a  border  conflict  against  India  last  year  in Kashmir  and  continues  to  threaten India in a number of ways, including by providing  support  and  a  base  for  terrorist  movements  active  in  Kashmir. By  aiding  Pakistan,  China  is  indirectly, but  in a very  real  sense,  threatening its neighbor India. India,  on  the  other  hand,  Mr.  Speaker,  does  not  engage  in  proliferation  activities. India has developed its own indigenous  nuclear  weapon  and  missile systems,  but  it  does  not  share  the  sensitive  technology  with  other  nations, much  less  with  unstable  regimes  that support  international  terrorism.  India does  not  seek  to  promote  tensions among  neighboring  countries,  as  China in  the  done  India-Pakihas  cynically  stan dispute. Given  Chinese  behavior  and  the  common  threat  it  poses  to  the  United States  and  India,  I  believe  that  President  Clinton  should  use  his  trip  to India  as  the  occasion  to  launch  a  new Indo-U.S.  defense  partnership.  I will  be calling  on  the  President  to  take  this much-needed action. While  this  is  a  bold  new  step,  I  believe  we  can  lay  the  groundwork  now for  a  far-reaching  alliance  between  the United  States  and  India,  including greatly  expanded  International  Military  Education  and  Training,  joint  exercises and other military and political links that the U.S. currently maintains with  our  key  democratic  allies  around the  world.  Such  a  partnership  may take  some  time  to  fully  develop,  but now  is  the  time  for  launching  it  and also pondering the details. Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  maintain  my view  that  the  President  should  not  go to  Pakistan  on  his  trip  to  South  Asia. It is important that the administration continue  to  send  the  message  to Islamabad  that  we  are  very  concerned about  Pakistan\u2019s  role  in  promoting  instability  in  Kashmir,  about  the  links between Pakistan  and  terrorist  organizations,  and  the  crushing  of  civilian government  by  the  military  junta  now in power. Currently,  Pakistan  is  not  on  the President\u2019s  South  Asia  itinerary.  Mr. Speaker,  Pakistan  has  done  nothing  to deserve  a  visit  by  the  President  of  the United States. f The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Under  a previous  order  of  the  House,  the  gentleman  from  Indiana  (Mr.  is recognized for 5 minutes. (Mr.  BURTON  of  Indiana  addressed the  House.  His  remarks  will  appear hereafter  in  the  Extensions  of  Remarks.) BURTON)  f UDALL)  CAMPAIGN  FINANCE  REFORM The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. SIMPSON). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr.  is  recognized  for  5  minutes. Mr.  UDALL  of  New  Mexico.  Mr. Speaker,  Americans  understand  that, without  campaign  finance  reform,  attempts  to  restructure  our  healthcare system, create a prescription drug benefit,  improve  our  communities,  protect our environment will all be  for naught. The  big,  important  issues  will  remain trapped  by  the  pressures  of  special  interests and big-money politics. The  fight  for  campaign  finance  reform  will  not  go  away.  I  personally pledge  to  continue  to  make  campaign finance  reform  one  of  Congress\u2019s  most urgent  priorities.  However,  opponents of  real  reform continue  to create a  legislative  logjam.  Deadlines  are  set  and ignored.

This  is  just a very  interesting article that  Time  magazine  reported  on  that the  authors  had  investigated. Again,  it gets  back  to  what  the  Supreme  Court in their decision in Nixon was basically saying,  that  if  there  is  not  reason enough  not  to  prevent  corruption  from occurring  in  the  political  process  to justify  campaign  finance  reform,  there is  certainly  enough  reason  because  of the  appearance  of  corruption  that other  people  sitting  back  in Wisconsin, for  instance,  the Mr. Doves  throughout the  country  have  towards  the  political process that adds to the cynicism and I think  disenchantment  and  eventually disenfranchisement  of  their  participation in the political process. f SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT  BY  THE  PRO  TEMPORE SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. The  Chair  would  remind  all Members  to  refrain  from  characterizing the Senate action or inaction.

Under the Speaker\u2019s announced policy of January  6,  1999,  the  gentleman  from  Colorado  (Mr.  is  recognized  for  60 minutes. Mr.  MCINNIS.  Mr.  Speaker,  this evening  during  the  next  hour  I  would MCINNIS)  JOHNSON).  like  to  have  a  night-side  chat  with my colleagues  in  regards  to  a  number  of different issues. The  first  issue  that  I  would  like  to start  out  with  is  the  death  tax  or  the estate  tax.  Then  I  would  like  to  move on  and  cover  a  few  points  on  the  marriage  penalty  tax,  move  from  there  to an  issue  that  I  think  has  become  fundamentally important to the defense of this  country,  and  that  is  the  missile defense.  In  fact,  tonight  I  intend  to spend  a  good  deal  of  time  discussing the  missile  defense  of  the  United States of America. Then  if  we  have  an  opportunity,  I would like to move on to the Social Security  earnings  limitation  repeal.  The gentleman from Florida (Mr. SHAW) has stepped  forward. And  I  think  tomorrow we will see a very close to a unanimous vote  to  lift  the  earnings  cap  for  those people  between  65  and  70  years  old who are  being  unfairly  penalized  by  the  tax law. So I do publicly want to congratulate the  gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr. SHAW),  and  I  would  also  like  to  congratulate  the  gentleman  from  Texas (Mr.  Both  of  those  gentlemen have worked very hard. I  also  want  to  congratulate  the Democrats  who  have  finally  come  on board  with  the  Republican  bill  to  help us  get  rid  of  this  unfair  taxation. Then if  we  have  a  little  time  after  that,  I would  like  to  talk  about  the  Internet, a  taxation  on  the  Internet.  So  there are  a  number  of  issues  tonight  on  our night-side chat that we can discuss. But  let  us  first  start  with  the  death tax.  What  is  the  death  tax,  number one?  Number  two,  what  property  does this  tax  tax  that  has  not  already  been taxed?  In  this  country,  there  is  a  tax called  the  estate  tax.  If  one\u2019s  accumulation  of  property  during  one\u2019s  lifetime,  property,  by  the  way,  of  which one  already  has  paid  taxes  upon  at least  once,  if  that  property  accumulates  over  a  certain  amount  of  money, the  Government  comes  in  after  one\u2019s death  and  mandates  upon  one\u2019s  surviving  members,  one\u2019s  family,  that  an additional  tax  be  levied  on  this  property that has already been taxed. It  is  probably  in  our  Tax  Code  the most  unfair,  punitive  tax  that  we  have got. There is no basis of justification to go  and  tax  somebody  upon  their  death, their  estate  upon  their  death,  on  property  that  throughout  their  entire  lifetime  they  have  paid  taxes  after  taxes after  taxes.  It  is  as  if  the  Government just did not get enough. Now,  one  would  ask,  why  is  something like that in our Tax Code? Why is it  not  easy  just  to  take  it  out?  Well,  I can  tell  you.  The  Clinton  administration,  and,  frankly,  most  of  the  Democrats  in  the  House,  have  opposed  taking  or  getting  rid  of  the  estate  tax. They say it is a tax for the rich. Well, what I invite those people to do is  come  out,  for  example,  to  the  State of  Colorado  or  go  to  any  State  in  the Union  and  take  a  look  at  small  businesses  that  are  now  being  impacted  by the  death  tax.  Take  a  look  at  what happens  to  families  from  the  personal level when  the Government  comes  into their life after having taxed their property  throughout  their  life  and  says  we have  got  to  take  one  more  hit  at  the deceased. We need to go  in and assess a tax  simply  based  on  the  reason  that they died. This  tax  has  devastating  impacts.  I will  give  my  colleagues  an  example.  I have  a  good  friend  of  mine  who  is  now deceased.  But  this  friend,  we  will  call him  Mr.  Joe,  Mr.  Joe  years  and  years ago  started  out  as  a  bookkeeper  in  a local construction company. He worked very,  very  hard  in  that  construction company.  After  a  while,  he  got  an  opportunity  through  years  of  hard  work to  buy  some  stock  in  the  construction company.  He  was  not  a  wealthy  man. But  he  and  his  family,  his  wife,  they scraped  together  a  few  pennies  here,  a few  pennies  there.  They  watched  their expenses, and they invested in stock. Well,  5  or  6  years  ago,  in  some  of  his investments,  he  sold  some  of  those  investments,  and  he  was  hit  with  a  tax called capital gains. Now,  most  of  the  citizens  of  this country will be assessed a capital gains taxation.  If  one\u2019s  mutual  funds,  if  one bought property, if one owns stock outside  of  mutual  funds,  it  is  a  gain  upon property  that  one  has  made,  and  they give a capital tax on it. So  that  is  what  they  did  when  Mr. Joe  sold  his  property.  He  was  hit  with a  capital  gains  taxation  at  that  time, which  was  around  the  rate  of  28  percent. So  take  out  a  pencil,  figure  out  that Mr.  Joe,  who  had  worked  throughout his  entire  life,  had  accumulated  property,  sold  a  portion  of  that  property, and  on  the  profit  on  that  property,  28 percent taxation. Unfortunately, my  friend Mr.  Joe  became  terminally  ill  within  a  month  or so  after  the  sale  of  this  property.  Even more  unfortunate  was  that  he  passed away  2  or  3  months  after  that.  The Government  then  came  in  to  that  family and said we realize that your  father in  this  case  has  paid  on  time  as  a  responsible  citizen  of  this  country  taxes on  the  property  that  now  belongs  to the estate. But we are here for a second dip  in  the  pot.  The  Government  has come  back,  and  we  think  it  is  necessary to tax the estate of the deceased person.  What  did  they  do  to  that  estate? Exactly what  they did  to  that estate,  they  hit  it  with  taxes  which, when  you  add  it  to  the  capital  gains tax,  gives  it  an  effective  tax  rate  of about  72  percent.  Seventy-two  percent on  that  estate  is what was  paid  in  taxation. Now,  let me  tell  you where  the  hardship  comes  in.  Number  one,  72  percent, imagine, you kind of  figure out  in your own  mind  what  property  you  have  in your  home,  what  property  you  and your  family has  in your home  that you own.  Then  try  to  determine  72  percent of  it  that  you  would  like  to  cut  out  of it  to  give  to  the  Government,  even though you already paid taxes on it.

            "67": "S902  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE February 29, 2000  education  requirements.  The  effect  of  this amendment would be to forfeit and  give  up  the  accumulation  of  $12  billion  in new resources and new assets.  That  seems  to me  to  be  pretty  shortsighted.  Why  would  we  forfeit  one  of  the  largest  infusions  of  resources\u2014I  might  add  one  of  the  smartest  infusions  of  resources\u2014coming  from  the  families themselves? We are not having  to  raise  taxes  to  do  it.  No  State,  nor  Governor,  nor  local  school  district  is  having  to  do  it.  People  are  doing  it  on  their  own.  They  are  producing  smart,  intelligent  dollars  because  those  dollars  will  be  invested  precisely  on  the  need of the students.  At  the  appropriate  time,  of  course,  I  will urge our colleagues on a bipartisan  basis to defeat this amendment because  the  effect  of  it  is  designed  to  make  moot  the  education  savings  accounts.  That  is  the  ultimate  goal  of  this  amendment.  As  I  said,  when  you  look  at  the  history  of  the  failure  to  deal  with  special  education,  I  think  the  Senator  from  New  Hampshire  referred  to  this  effort  as  somewhat  hollow  in  that  year  after  year,  no  attention was  paid  to  the  special  accounts.  Suddenly,  we  will  use  it  as  a  weapon  against  an  education  savings  account,  which  would  choke  out,  as  I  said,  $12 billion  in new  resources.  I  am  all  for  and  will  support  in  next  year\u2019s  budget  additional  funding  for  IDEA  but  not  at  the  expense  of  forfeiting  a  voluntarily  accumulated  $12  billion that will come to the aid of public,  private,  and  home  schooling  education all across the country.  I  might  add,  the  legislation  we  are  debating  deals  with  school  construction.  It  does  it  in  the  appropriate  way  because  it  allows  the  decisionmaking  to occur at  the  local area. The Senator  from  Nevada  goes  to  great  extent  to  suggest  their  plans  will  not  interrupt  or  in  any  way  constrain  local  school  decisions. But the fact of the matter is,  in  the  last  30  years  quite  the  opposite  has  occurred.  Most  of  our  Federal  programs  have  led  to  enormous  constraints  and  mandates  on  local  school  districts.  The  education  savings  account goes in a completely different direction.  It  empowers  parents  and  students  and  employers.  It  has  no  mandates.  So I remind everybody the legislation  deals  with  education  savings  accounts  empowering  parents  to  help  their  children.  It  empowers  employers  to  have  programs  of  continuing  education.  It  helps students who are in State-prepaid  tuition plans so those resources are not  lost  to  the  tax  collector.  It  contributes  to  allowing  more  flexibility  so  local  school  districts  can  be  involved  in  school  construction\u2014this  idea  coming  from  Senator  of  Florida,  from  the other side of the aisle.  With that, I will yield the floor.  Mr.  DURBIN.  Will  the  Senator  for a question?  Mr. COVERDELL. Certainly.  Mr.  DURBIN.  I  say  to  the  Senator,  though  we  certainly  disagree  on  apGRAHAM yield  proach,  I commend him  for his  interest  in  education.  One  thing  I  found  interesting in the analysis of my colleague\u2019s  bill  is  the  suggestion  that  most  of  the  benefits  for  education  will  go  to  the  wealthiest people in this country.  Will  the  Senator  comment  on  that  and  tell  me  whether  he  believes,  as  I  do,  that  though  we  want  every  family  to have an opportunity,  if we are going  to  have  limited  resources  applied  for  incentives in education, we should look  to working  families and middle-income  families\u2014and  lower  income  families,  for  that  matter,  who  otherwise  may  not  ever  be  able  to  send  their  kids  off  to  college\u2014as  our  highest  priority,  as  opposed  to  the  approach  of  the  Senator,  which  apparently  takes  the  wealthiest  families  as  the  highest  priority.  Mr.  COVERDELL.  I  am  pleased  the  Senator  asked  the  question.  I  do  not  know where  he  is  getting  the  data. Let  me respond in this way. The means test  is  identical  to  the  one  both  the  President  and  the  Congress  used  for  the  higher  education  IRA.  There  is  no  difference. We  all  celebrated  that  IRA  account.  You  can  save  up  to  $500  a  year  for  your  college  education.  All  this  says is it should be larger, $2,000, and it  should  be  available  for  K\u201312.  But  there  is no difference in the means testing.  The  data  I  have  seen  over  and  over  suggested  over  70  percent  of  all  these  savings,  or  the  use  of  the  savings  accounts,  would  go  to  families  earning  $75,000  or  less.  So  if  there  is  a  pox  on  this means test,  then  there  is the same  one  on  an  account  which  we  have  all  been  applauding  for  the  last  2  or  3  years.  Mr. DURBIN. Will  the Senator  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.  Mr.  DURBIN. My  argument  or  observation was we want all families to consider  higher  education  and  educational  opportunities,  regardless  of  what  they  are  earning.  I  will  just  concede  for  the  sake  of  this  debate  that  the  Senator  from  Georgia  is  correct,  and  the  $500  IRA  that was  proposed  by  the  administration,  supported  by  all  of  us,  probably  does  benefit  those  who  can  save.  Generally,  those  are  people  in  higher  income categories.  My  question  to  the  Senator  from  Georgia is, if he is proposing a new program  in  addition  to  this,  would  it  not  be  better  now  to  focus  on  those  who  were  not  served  by  that  $500  IRA  and  really  focus on  those  families who may  not  have  the  benefit  of  it  if  we  are  going to expand our investment in education?  The  Treasury  Department  estimates  that  under  the  Senator\u2019s  bill,  the  wealthiest  20  percent,  the  upper  one-  fifth  of  families  in  America,  will  receive  nearly  70  percent  of  the  benefits.  Wouldn\u2019t  it  be more  fair,  since  the  initial  IRA,  as my  colleague  noted,  really  helps  those  families,  that  additional  money spent should go to working families  and  those  who  maybe  have  been  overlooked  by  both  the  administration  and  the  Senate  to  this  point?  Why  do  yield?  yield?  path  of  subthe  wealthiwe  want  to  continue  this  sidizing  families  who  are  est in our country?  Mr.  COVERDELL.  Maybe  it  is  just  a  disagreement  between  the  two  of  us  about what constitutes wealth. I do not  consider families, middle-income, earning  $75,000  or  less,  as  wealthy  people.  Maybe  the  Senator  from  Illinois  or  some  other  analysis  does,  but  I  do  not.  I  think  this  is  the  backbone  of  the  country.  They  are  the  people  who  bear  the  largest  burden  of  the  Tax  Code.  They  are  having  a  hard  time.  Their  income  tax  is  at  the  highest  level  since  World  War  II.  It  is  so  high  now  that  with the disposable income available to  them,  to  do  the  things  we  expect  them  to do about  raising  their  families,  they  cannot do any more.  So  we  may  just  have  a  disagreement  over who is considered wealthy.  Mr. DURBIN. Will  the Senator  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.  Mr.  DURBIN.  I  say  to  the  Senator,  my  guess  is when we  are  talking  about  the upper 20 percent of America, we are  not  talking  about  those  of  75,000  or  less;  we  are  probably  talking  about  $75,000 annual income or more.  Mr.  COVERDELL.  I  said  that  30  percent  of  these  accounts,  as was  the  case  with  the  account  we  have  already  passed,  would  inure  to  their  benefit,  which is not bad.  Mr. DURBIN. Less than a third?  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes. So  two-thirds  plus  of  this,  in  my  judgment\u2014we  can  disagree\u2014is  going  exactly  where  we  want it to go.  If I might add one other point, unlike  the  IRA  we  have  already  passed,  and  unlike  any  other  IRA,  this  account  allows sponsors. We do not know the data  on  that.  It  is  a  benefit  to  even  the  lower  income.  It  allows  parents,  families,  unions,  benevolent  associations,  and  employers  to  help  open  these  accounts.  From  what  I  have  seen  of  people  trying  to  utilize  new  tools  and  resources,  it  is  the  struggling  families  who  are  most  likely  to  use  these  accounts.  Mr.  DURBIN.  I  will  make  one  final  comment and then I will yield the floor  because  I  see  the  Senator  from  Massachusetts  waiting.  I  do  not  disagree  with  the  Senator  from  Georgia  in  his  intent  on  helping  families  pay  for  education.  That,  too,  is  a  concern  of  my  colleague,  Senator  from  New  York,  who  supports  the  President\u2019s  plan  of  deductibility  of  college  expenses  on  your  tax  returns.  I  think  that  is  an  excellent  way  of  increasing  opportunity in education.  I  do  believe,  if  we  are  going  to  take  our  money  and  our  surplus  and  invest  it in education, we should look to those  who,  frankly,  need  the  most  help.  I  think it would be the working families.  I am afraid  the Senator\u2019s approach, according  to  the  Treasury  Department  analysis,  gives  70  percent  of  the  benefits  to  families  in  the  upper  20  percent  of America. It tips the scales heavily to  the  wealthiest  families.  I  agree  with  the Senator\u2019s comments, and I hope his  SCHUMER VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:40 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S29FE0.REC S29FE0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",

Mr. DODD. For  those who may be  interested, there is a strong record of the  Congress  through  all  of  the  1980s,  up  until  1992  actually,  doing  a  better  job  in terms of what we put  into  special ed  than  the  administration,  which  did  a  bit  better  from  1992  up  through  1996;  and  then  the  Congress  has  done  better  than  the  President  in  the  last  4  years  in these areas.  Secondly,  with  regard  to  the  point  raised,  again,  I  said  earlier,  there  are  parts  of  the  bill  offered  by  my  friend  from  Georgia  with  which  I  agree.  I  am  not  offering  this  amendment  as  a  substitute  to  his  bill.  It  is  only  dealing  with  one  part  of  it.  There  are  parts  of  this  bill  of  which  I  am  very  much  supportive.  It  is  like  anything  else,  you  have to make choices. Would we like to  do  everything?  Maybe  some  people  would  like  to  do  everything.  But  we  can\u2019t  do  everything.  We  have  all  painfully learned that.  We  finally  have  ourselves  in  a  situation  where  we  now  have  surpluses.  We  are  moving  in  the  right  direction.  The  interest  rates  and  the  economy  reflect  the  fact  that  we  are  showing  much  more  fiscal  discipline  than  has  been  the case in the past.  I am suggesting that given the choice  between  a  $1.2  billion  tax  proposal,  a  new  program  that  may  or  may  not  produce,  even  if  we  take  the  best  estimates,  the  results  that  its  proponents  suggest\u2014that  is,  $1.2  billion  taken  off  the  table\u2014based  on  the  evidence  that  has  been  submitted  by  the  Joint  Committee  on  Taxation,  the  benefit  for  people  whose  children  go  to  public  schools  is  very  limited. They  say  $20.50  over  5  years.  Those  are  not  my  numbers.  Those  aren\u2019t  out  of  the  Democratic  National  Committee  or  some  Democratic  think  tank.  It  is  the  Joint  Committee  on  Taxation,  a  nonpartisan  committee  that  analyzes  what  the  tax  implications  are.  We  use  it  all  the  time.  They  are  saying  to  us:  If  you  are  the  parents of public school education children,  which  is  where  50  million  kids  went  to  school  this  morning\u2014of  the  55  million  kids  who  went  to  school,  50  million of them went to public schools,  elementary  and  secondary,  5  million  went to private and parochial schools\u2014  for the parents of those 50 million kids,  the  average  benefits  of  all  of  this  over  5 years is $20.50.  I pose the question, Which  is the better  choice?  If  you  think  you  could  do  everything,  then  you  ought  to  vote,  I  guess, against my amendment and hope  at  some  later  date  you  get  a  chance  to  vote for it. We will do everything.  I  don\u2019t  think  we  can  do  everything.  So  I  am  merely  posing  an  alternative  that  I  think would be more meaningful  to our mayors, county executives, Governors.  In  fact,  this  morning,  at  the  combination  meeting  of  the  Governors  and  the  Senators,  it  was  Governor  Angus  King,  independent  Governor  of  Maine,  who  stood  up  and  said:  If  you  want  to  do  something  about  education\u2014and,  by  the  way,  I  never  met  him  before;  I  still  haven\u2019t  met  him.  I  don\u2019t  know  the  man.  But  he  stood  up  and  said:  If  you  guys  in  the  Senate  really want to do something about education,  why  don\u2019t  you  do  something  about  special  education  and  our  costs?  He  got  a  standing  ovation,  applause  from everybody in the room.  The  Governor  of  Pennsylvania,  Tom  Ridge,  and  Governor  Tom  Carper  of  Delaware  said:  This  is  the  priority.  Whom can I call? Whom can I get ahold  of  for you to vote  for your amendment,  to  support  your  amendment  this  afternoon?  Not  because  they  disagree  with  what  their  friend  and  colleague,  as  he  is  mine,  is  proposing  here,  but  because  they  think  this  is a better  choice, with  limited  resources,  to  go  to  Oklahoma,  Connecticut,  Florida,  to  Georgia,  to  get  back  to  our  communities.  It  doesn\u2019t  solve  the  special  education  problem. We would have  to appropriate  $15 billion to get to the 40 percent obligation.  I  don\u2019t  want  to  create  the  illusion  that  I am solving that problem. We are  just getting closer to  it. We are at 12.7.  We  were  at  7  percent.  Then  we  started  to  inch  up  a  little  bit  in  terms  of  getting better. Now we are close  to 13 percent,  a  far  cry  from  40,  the  $1.2  billion,  and  I  don\u2019t  have  the  number  what  it  gets  you  to.  I  think  probably  another  couple  points,  2  or  3  percentage  points,  maybe  4  in  terms  of  what  that  $1.2  billion spread out over 50 States would do.  But at least it is tax relief.  My  friend  says  we  do  it  for  higher  education.  There  is  no  property  tax  that  supports  higher  education.  There  are  State  revenues  that  do  it,  but  on  a  local  basis  that  is  not  where  it  comes  from.  In  the  case  of  public  elementary  and  secondary  education,  for  the  most  part  it  is  free.  There  are  costs  associated  with  educating  a  child.  I  know  that. But I know very few public higher  educational  institutions  that  are  free.  Most  of  them  are  pretty  expensive  today.  Some  have  a  limited  amount  of  cost,  but  for most  of  them,  it  is  pretty  expensive.  Of  course,  you  don\u2019t  have  to  go  to  college.  We  would  like  everybody  to.  The  law  requires  you  go  to  elementary  school and requires that you go to high  school  or  at  least  stay  in  school  until  you  are  16.  For  most  States,  I  think  that  is  true.  But  there  is  no  requirement you go beyond  that. So  there  is a  distinction  between  what  our  obligations  are  to  elementary  and  secondary  education  and  what  we  try  to  achieve  in  higher  education\u2014obviously,  a  huge  distinction in cost.  Although  I  have  disagreements  with  the  underlying  proposal  offered  by  my  friend  from  Georgia,  I  believe  we  are  trying to be all places at the same time  and, as a result of that, not doing much  in any.  My fundamental point is not so much  to  say  this  is  not  a  good  idea  he  has  proposed but to say this is a better one.  I  don\u2019t  know  of  a  mayor  in  my  State  who  hasn\u2019t  asked  me  to  do  something  about  this  issue  for  the  last  10  years.  When  I  go  back,  as  I  know  all  of  our  colleagues  do,  when  I  go  back  to  them  and say: What do you want me to work  on  this  year?\u2014I  think  all  of  us  do  that  probably in our December-February periods; we  go  back  and  talk  to  the  local  officials  who  are  close  to  our  constituents  in  our  States.  I  don\u2019t  know  of  a  year  when  this  special  education  issue  hasn\u2019t been  in  the  top  five of  the  items  about  which  they  say:  Look,  this  is  a  tremendous  cost  to  us.  You  mandated  it,  basically,  at  the  Federal  level  in  1975.  We  don\u2019t  disagree  with  you.  We  think  we  ought  to  provide  educational  opportunity  for  children  with  special  needs  in  this  country  so  they  will  maximize  their  potential.  But  you  promised  us,  Mr.  Senator,  you  were  going to come up with 40 percent of the  cost  of  this.  You  told  us  we  have  to  do  it.  We  agree  with  you.  Now  you  are  only up to 12 or 13 percent.  Frankly,  in  a  lot  of  States,  it  is  around  5  percent,  9  percent.  I  don\u2019t  have  every  State  here  because  not  every  State  gives  us  all  the  numbers.  Looking  down  this  list,  as  I mentioned  earlier, California has a $3 billion higher  education  cost. The Federal Government  comes  up  with  5  percent  of  that.

No,  public  school  is  not  free.  And  $2,000  is  a  lot  for  most  families.  We  could  be  wrong.  Senator  and  I  could  be  wrong.  We  could  offer  this  chance  to  every  labor  union,  church,  and  grandparent  in America  to  help  with  their  kids\u2019  education  by  putting money  in  every  birthday,  holiday,  or  Christmas,  and  maybe  nobody  will  answer.  But  I  don\u2019t  believe  that.  That  is  not  the  kind  of  people  we  are.  That  is  not  the  kind  of  communities  I  represent.  I  think  people  will  answer.  I  think  Floyd  Flake  is  right.  Every  Member  of  the  Senate  talks  about  faith-based  answers  to  problems, working hand in hand with the Government.  Well,  let\u2019s  see.  I  bet  the  grandparents,  aunts and uncles,  labor unions, churches,  and  synagogues  will  come  forward  and  use  these  accounts  as  a  vehicle.  But  mostly,  I  don\u2019t  want  to  fail  because  we  didn\u2019t  ask.  This  is  an  invitation  to  America  to  get  back  in  your  public  or  private  school,  get  involved  and solve the problem.  I  believe  these  are  worthwhile.  Senator DODD may be right that this  institution  doesn\u2019t  have  the  will  or  the  resources  to answer  this problem and  the  special  education  problem  and  the  school  construction  problem.  If  this  country  doesn\u2019t  have  the  will  or  resources to deal with those problems, we  are headed for real trouble. I believe we  have  the  will,  and  I  certainly  believe  we  have  the  resources\u2014not  expenditures,  not  a  dime  of  it,  but  investments,  every  single  dollar  in  every  investment  for  building  a  school  or  hiring a teacher.  I will  fight every day  for  every one of those things.  Today  is  the Coverdell-Torricelli  legislation  for private savings accounts to  fund  public  and  private  schools.  I  am  proud  to  be  part  of  it.  I  yield  to  Senator COVERDELL.  Mr.  COVERDELL.  I  am  most  appreciative  of  the  extended  effort  on  the  part  of  the  Senator  from  New  Jersey,  who  brings  a  very  powerful  perspective  to this debate.  The Senator  from Connecticut  is correct  that  we  are  constantly  confronted  with  choices.  I  think  this  is  a  bad  example,  though,  or  choice  of  that  kind  of  trade.  What  I  mean  is,  first  of  all,  I  believe  IDEA  will  receive  added  benefits  this  year.  It  has  received  nearly  $3  billion  in  the  last  4  years  over  and  above  the President\u2019s  request. So  there  is  a  body  here  that  agrees  with  those  Governors  and  with  you  that  this  is  a  high priority.  The  problem  with  the  Senator\u2019s  amendment  is  when  it  moves  against  the savings accounts,  it blows away $12  billion.  There  are  choices.  You  could  say, well, we will spend $1.2 billion here  instead  of  $1.2  billion  over  there.  But  by  the  nature  of  this  legislation,  this  savings  account  involves  14  million  families\u201420 million  of  those  55 million  you  are  talking  about\u20143  million  or  4  million  of  them  are  in  private  schools,  but  11  million  of  these  children  are  in  public  schools  that  will  benefit  from  these accounts.  The Senator\u2019s amendment  takes  that  resource, which comes forward as a voluntary  action  on  the  part  of  families  and  communities,  churches,  synagogues,  labor  unions,  and  employers  and  shuts  it  down.  That  is  not  a  good  trade.  Trading  $1.2  billion  and  losing  $12  billion  is  not  a  good  trade.  There  may be a place where your choice is appropriate,  but  I  don\u2019t  believe  it  is  where  you  blow  away  all  that  benefit,  which this does.  It  has  been  characterized  that  private  schools  are  the  chief  beneficiary,  and that is not the case. Several on the  floor  have  characterized  parochial  schools  as  a  \u2018\u2018haven  for  the  wealthy.\u2019\u2019  Listen,  the  children  attending  parochial  schools  today  are  within  10  percent  of  the  same  children  attending  public schools, and they are  from  families earning $40,000 or $50,000.  These  are  not  a  bunch  of  wealthy  folks.  The  demographics  in  the  New  York  school  system  are  virtually  identical  between  the  public  system  and  the  parochial  system.  So  it  is  not  like  somebody who happens  to be  in a parochial  school  and  drives  up  to  school  in  a  long,  black  limousine  and  a  guy  in  knickers  gets  out.  These  are  minorities.  They  are  Hispanic.  They  are  African Americans. They are average folks.  I  don\u2019t  know  why  they  are  there.  The  public systems ought to be mighty glad  it  is  there  because  it works  both ways.  The  Senator  is  right.  That  system  couldn\u2019t  accept  the  public  system,  and  it  never will. Conversely,  close  it  down  and  you  make  new  problems  for  the  public  system  because  those  people  are  paying  property  taxes  even  though  their  children  are  in  the  parochial  system.  The  point  I  am  trying  to  make  is  that  the  public  system  will  be  a  major  benefactor.  It  is  not  a  minor  player.  The  choice  the  Senator  is  asking  us  to  make  is not $1.2 billion here or $1.2 billion  there.  It  is  $1.2  billion  here  or  no  $12 billion. Of that $12 billion, $6 billion  is  going  to  go  into  public  schools  over  the next 10 years and $6 billion is going  to  go  into  private,  or  home,  or  whatever. Those are major dollars.  When  the  Senator  from  California  and others  talk about  the benefit,  they  BUNNING Collins  Without  don\u2019t  mention  the  principal.  That  is  the  point.  That  is  how  you  get  up  to  the  $12  billion.  The  Senator  is  right.  It  is  not  a  lot  of  relief  that  the  Federal  Government is giving. What is amazing  to  me  is  how  little  it  takes  to  cause  these families to do so much.  Mr.  President,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  Senator  be  added  as  a  cosponsor  to  the  amendment  No. 2854.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  objection, it is so ordered.  The Senator from Connecticut.  Mr.  DODD.  Mr.  President,  if  my  colleague  from  Georgia  needs  another  minute  or  two  to  make  concluding  remarks,  I  will  be  happy  to  yield  my  time,  or  if  the  Senator  from  New  Jersey would care to be heard.  My colleagues conveniently use numbers  which,  obviously,  sound  beneficial  to  their  argument.  The  fact  is,  according to the Joint Tax Committee, which  analyzed  this  proposal,  if  you  are  the  family of a child in a public school, the  tax benefit to you over 5 years is $20.50.  That  is  the  tax  benefit  to  a  family  whose  child  is  in  a  public  school.  Is  it  worth  taking  that  much  off  the  table  in the name of education and providing  tax  relief  which  is  so  nominal  it  is  hardly worth mentioning?  You  can  make  a  case.  You  have  heard  it  over  the  years.  Businesses  say:  If  you  will  give  me  this  tax  break,  it  will  leverage  this  much  more  in  private  capital.  The  fact  is,  you  still  have  to  have  a  tax  break.  It  is  revenue lost.  We  have  come  a  long  way  in  the  last  7  or  8  years.  We  have  a  surplus  for  the  first  time  in  the  last  few  years. We  are  actually  on  track  to  eliminating  the  national  debt.  The  idea  that  we  can  just  take  $1.2  billion  off  the  table  is  a  flawed  idea.  Even  if  you  accept  the  point  of  my  colleagues  and  leverage  private  dollars,  it  may  generate  some  of  this activity  they are  talking about,  but  the  fact  is,  it  is  $1.2  billion.  It  is  rolling the dice, in effect.  I have suggested that there is $1.2 billion  that  could  be  used  to  defray  the  cost  of  special  education.  I  know  that  amount  would  ease  the  burden  on  our  school  districts.  As my  colleagues  well  know,  you  take  $1.2  billion  and  put  it  in  this  program,  then  you  will  come  and  say:  Let\u2019s  do  something  on  special  education. What about school construction?  What  about  teacher  salaries  and  smaller  class  sizes?  Those  are  things  we  know  we  need  to  improve  the  quality of public  education  in  this  country.  Those  dollars  become  harder  and  harder  to  come  by  as  we  take  more  and  more dollars off the table.  Unless  you  accept  the  notion  we  are  going  to  accept  everybody\u2019s  idea  on  how  to  improve  the  quality  of  public  education\u2014which  we  are  not  and  we  have limited resources\u2014the people who  pay  the  taxes  in  this  country  that  come  into  the  general  revenue  of  the  Treasury know  full well we can\u2019t spend  their  money  on  everything.

            "91": "S926  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE February 29, 2000  President\u2019s  budget  would  have  made  them  much  easier  to  enact.  But,  once  again,  the  Administration  has  chosen  to pass its moral responsibilities to the  Congress.  For too long, this Administration has  ignored the needs of the brave men and  women who have defended our interests  and  our  shores.  This  is  unfair.  What  is  more, in my view it is unwise to ignore  the well-being of military retirees.  Well-trained,  properly  motivated  troops  have  been  and  continue  to  be  the  single  most  important  factor  in  protecting our national  security. Without them we will not be able to achieve  and  maintain  military  readiness.  We  will  not  be  able,  as  a  nation,  to  fight  and  win.  Under  current  conditions  we  cannot expect to maintain the levels of  re-enlistment,  expertise  and morale we  need  to  maintain  an  effective  military  force.  Last  year  this  Congress  took  it  upon  itself  to  address  the  critical  issue  of  unconscionably  low  military  pay.  I  hope  and  believe  that  this  year we will  address  the  no-less  critical  issue  of  unconscionably  inadequate  health  care  services for military retirees.  This  Congress  and  the  President  must  take  action  to  address  the  problems associated with the availability of  health  care  for military  retirees. Keeping this nation\u2019s promise and providing  adequate health care for military retirees  is  an  issue  whose  time  has  come.  Every  day,  in  hundreds  of  locations  all  over the world, our soldiers, sailors and  airmen willingly serve in defense of our  national  interest,  promoting  peace  and  prosperity around the globe.  We  have  asked  for  the  greatest  sacrifice  from  our  military  retirees  and  today\u2019s men and women  in uniform\u2014to  give  one\u2019s  life  in  defense  of  their  nation.  When  people  put  themselves  in  harm\u2019s  way  for  their  country,  they  should  not  have  to  worry  about  their  families\u2019 access to proper health care.  We  must  act  upon  the  sense  of  this  Congress that the United States has incurred  a  moral  obligation  to  provide  health  care  to  former  members  of  the  Armed  Forces  who  are  entitled  to  retired  or  retainer  pay  (or  its  equivalent);  and  it  is,  therefore,  necessary  to  provide  quality,  affordable  health  to  such retirees.  For  these  reasons  with  Senators  and 13  fellow Senators  in co-sponsoring  the  bipartisan  Keep  Our  Promise  to  America\u2019s  Military  Retirees  Act  (S. 2003).  This  legislation  is  key  to  re-  establishing  the  morale,  confidence  and trust of our military retirees.  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  important legislation.  COVERDELL,  JOHNSON,  am  happy  this  I  to  join  f  BLACK  HISTORY  MONTH  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, during  the  Civil  Rights  movement,  Dr.  Carter  G.  Woodson\u2019s  idea  of  a  Negro  History  Week honoring the achievements of African  Americans  was  extended  to  the  entire month of February.  I  rise  today  as  a  Senator  from  the  state with the largest population of African  Americans  in  the  United  States  to  speak  on  behalf  of  this  year\u2019s  Black  History  Month  theme  \u2018\u2018Heritage  and  Horizons.\u2019\u2019  Harlem,  New  York  was  the  center of a 1930\u2019s Renaissance period. It  attracted  aspiring  individuals  from  across  the  country  and  the  world.  It  is  also the birthplace of renowned African  Americans  who  have  excelled  in  the  areas  of  politics  and  business,  arts  and  entertainment,  athletics  and  activism.  Since the expansion of the Negro History  Week  to  Black  History  Month,  countless  African  Americans  continue  to  amass  accomplishments  and  shatter  barriers  worthy  of  multiple  months  of  tribute.  Many  of  us  know  of  the  great  strides  made  by  Dr.  Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.,  Frederick  Douglas,  Booker  T. Washington, W. E. B. DuBois,  Ida B.  Wells,  and  Rosa  Parks.  Many  of  the  Members  in  this  chamber  have  worked  alongside  Shirley  Chisholm,  Thurgood  Marshall  Sr.,  Charles  Rangel,  Clifford  Alexander, Jr., and Colin Powell.  African  Americans  from  New  York  have  been  pioneers  in  many  different  fields.  In 1981, Pam McAllister Johnson  was  named  publisher  of  Gannett\u2019s  Ithaca  (NY)  Journal,  making  her  the  first  African  American  woman  to  head  a  general  circulation  newspaper  in  the  United States.  In June  1995, Dr. Lonnie  Bristow,  a  Harlem  native,  became  the  first  African  American  appointed  as  president  of  the  American  Medical  Association.  American  Express  announced  in February  1997  that Kenneth  Chenault was named president and heir  apparent  to  the  position  of  CEO,  making the Long  Island native the highest-  ranking African American  executive  in  corporate America.  Art  Hardwick,  husband  of  Shirley  Chisholm, won the 1962 State Assembly  race  becoming  the  first  African  American to represent Western New York. In  1971,  Carmel  C.  Marr  became  the  first  woman of any race to serve as Commissioner  of  the  New  York  State  Public  Service  Commission.  Harry  Belafonte,  a  Harlem  native,  was  recently  honored  at  the  Grammy\u2019s  for  his  lifetime  contributions  as  an  actor  and  entertainer.  Denzel  Washington,  born  and  raised  in  Mount  Vernon,  recently  won  a  Golden  Globe  for  his  role  in  the  movie  Hurricane.  The  critically  acclaimed  author  of  The  Women  of  Brewster  Place,  Gloria  Naylor,  hails  from  Queens,  New  York.  In  1957, New York City  native Althea  Gibson  was  the  first  African  American  woman  to  compete  and  win  at  the  Wimbledon  and  Forest  Hills.  The  following  year,  she  repeated  as  the  Wimbledon  and  U.S.  National  Tennis  Champion.  Former  NBA  coach  and  Brooklyn  native,  Lenny  Wilkins,  was  voted  into the Basketball Hall of Fame  for  holding  the  NBA  record  for  the  most  regular  season  victories  by  a  coach.

Mr.  President,  I  am  extremely  pleased  to  rise  today  to  speak  about  George  Daniels,  who  has  just been confirmed as a Federal Judge  in  the  Southern  District  of  New  York.  George  Daniels  is  uniquely  qualified  to  serve  in  this  position.  His  work  experience is as diverse and impressive as  it  gets:  He  has  been  a  Legal  Aid  Defense  Attorney  and  a  prosecutor;  he  has  worked  at  a  top  New  York  Law  firm  and  served  as  a  Law  Professor;  he  worked  in  politics  as  Counsel  to  the  Mayor  of  New  York,  and,  of  course,  he  has been a Judge\u2014first on the Criminal  Court of the City of New York and then  as  a  Justice  on  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  State  of  New  York.  I  know  he  has  the  respect  and  the  admiration  from  individuals on both sides of the aisle.  I  am  extremely  pleased  to  see  him  confirmed  as  a  Federal  Judge.  I  know  he will  be  an  extraordinary  addition  to  the  Southern  District  of  New  York  bench.  f  THE  VERY  BAD  DEBT  BOXSCORE  Mr.  HELMS.

            "99": "S934  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE February 29, 2000  GRASSLEY,  Under  mandatory,  binding  arbitration,  even  if  a  party  believes  that  the  arbitrator did not consider all the facts  or  follow  the  law,  the party  cannot  file  a suit in court. The only basis for challenging  a  binding  arbitration  decision  is  if  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  the  arbitrator  committed  actual  fraud.  In  contrast,  if  a  dispute  is  resolved  by  a  court,  the  parties  can  potentially  pursue an appeal of  the  lower court\u2019s decision.  Mr.  President,  because  mandatory,  binding  arbitration  is  so  conclusive,  it  can be a credible means of dispute resolution only when all parties understand  the  full  ramifications of agreeing  to  it.  But  that\u2019s  not  what\u2019s  happening  in  a  variety  of  contexts\u2014from  motor  vehicle  franchise  agreements,  to  employment  agreements,  to  credit  card  agreements.  I\u2019m  proud  to  have  sponsored  legislation  addressing  employment  agreements  and  motor  vehicle  franchise  agreements.  In  fact,  I  am  the  original  cosponsor  with  my  distinguished  colleague  from  Iowa,  Senator  of  S.  1020,  which  would  prohibit  the unilateral  imposition  of mandatory,  binding  arbitration  in  motor  vehicle  dealership  agreements  with  manufacturers. Many  of  our  colleagues  have joined us as cosponsors.  Similar  to  the  problem  in  the  motor  vehicle  dealership  franchise  context,  there  is  a  growing,  menacing  trend  of  credit  card  companies  and  consumer  credit  lenders  inserting  mandatory,  binding  arbitration  clauses  in  agreements with  consumers.  Companies  like  First USA Bank, American Express and  Green  Tree  Discount  Company  unilaterally  insert  mandatory,  binding  arbitration  clauses  in  their  agreements  with consumers, often without the consumer\u2019s knowledge or consent.  The  most  common  way  credit  card  companies  have  done  this  is  through  the  use  of  a  \u2018\u2018bill  stuffer.\u2019\u2019  Bill  stuffers  are the advertisements and other materials  that  credit  card  companies  insert  into  envelopes  with  their  customers\u2019  monthly  statements.  Some  credit  card  issuers  like  American  Express  have  placed  fine  print  mandatory  arbitration  clauses  in  bill  stuffers.  The  arbitration  provision  is  usually  buried  in  fine  print  in  a  mailing  that  includes  a  bill  and  various  advertising  materials.  It  is  often  described  in  a  lengthy  legal  document  that  most  consumers  probably  don\u2019t  even  skim,  much  less  read  carefully.  American  Express  issued  its  mandatory  arbitration  provision  last  year.  It  took effect on June 1st. So, if you\u2019re an  American  Express  cardholder  and  you  have  a  dispute  with  American  Express,  as  of  June  1999,  you  can\u2019t  take  your  claim  to  court,  even  small  claims  court.  You  are  bound  to  use  arbitration, and you are bound to the final arbitration decision. In this case, you are  also  bound  to  use  an  arbitration  organization  selected by American Express,  the National Arbitration Forum.  American Express isn\u2019t the only credit  card  company  imposing  mandatory  arbitration  on  its  customers.  First  USA  Bank,  the  largest  issuer  of  Visa  cards,  with  58  million  customers,  has  been  doing  the  same  thing  since  1997.  First  USA  also  alerted  its  cardholders  with  a  bill  stuffer,  containing  a  condensed  set  of  terms  and  conditions  in  fine  print. The  cardholder,  by  virtue  of  continuing  to  use  the  First  USA  card,  gave  up  the  right  to  go  to  court,  even  small  claims  court,  to  resolve  a  dispute.  Mr.  President,  this  growing  practice  extends  beyond  credit  cards  into  the  consumer  loan  industry.  Consumer  credit  lenders  like  Green  Tree  Consumer Discount Company  are  inserting  mandatory, binding arbitration  clauses  in  their  loan  agreements.  The  problem  is  that  these  loan  agreements  are  usually  adhesion  contracts,  which  means  that  consumers  must  either  sign  the  agreement  as  is,  or  forego  a  loan.  In  other  words,  consumers  lack  the  bargaining  power  to  have  the  clause  removed.  More  importantly,  when  signing  on  the  dotted  line  of  the  loan  agreement,  consumers  may  not  even  understand  what  mandatory  arbitration  means.  In  all  likelihood,  they  do  not  understand  that  they  have  just  signed  away  a  right  to  go  to  court  to  resolve a dispute with the lender.  It might  be  argued  that  if  consumers  are not pleased with being  subjected  to  a  mandatory  arbitration  clause,  they  can cancel their credit card, or not execute on their  loan agreement, and take  their  business  elsewhere.  Unfortunately,  that\u2019s easier  said  than done. As  I  mentioned,  First  USA  Bank,  the  nation\u2019s  largest  Visa  card  issuer,  is  part  of  this  questionable  practice.  In  fact,  the  practice  is  becoming  so  pervasive  that  consumers  may  soon  no  longer  have  an  alternative,  unless  they  forego  use of a credit card or a consumer  loan  entirely.  Consumers  should  not  be  forced to make that choice.  Companies  like  First USA, American  Express  and  Green  Tree  argue  that  they  rely  on  mandatory  arbitration  to  resolve  disputes  faster  and  cheaper  than  court  litigation.  The  claim  may  be  resolved  faster  but  is  it  really  cheaper?  Is  it  as  fair  as  a  court  of  law?  I  don\u2019t  think  so.  Arbitration  organizations  often  charge  exorbitant  fees  to  the  consumer  who  brings  a  dispute\u2014  often  an  initial  filing  fee  plus  hourly  fees  to  the arbitrator or arbitrators  involved  in  the  case.  These  costs  can  be  much  higher  than  bringing  the  matter  to  small  claims  court  and  paying  a  court filing fee.  For  example,  the  National  Arbitration  Forum,  the  arbitration  entity  of  choice  for  American  Express  and  First  USA charges  fees that are  likely greater  than  if  the  consumer  brought  a  dispute in small claims court. For a claim  of  less  than  $1,000,  the  National  Arbitration  Forum  charges  the  consumer  a  $49  filing  fee.  In  contrast,  a  consumer  can  bring  the  same  claim  to  small  claims court here  in the District of Columbia  for  a  filing  fee  of  no more  than  $10.  In  other  words,  the  consumer  pays  a  fee  to  the  National  Arbitration  Forum  that  is  nearly  five  times  more  than  the  fee  for  filing  a  case  in  small  claims court.  That\u2019s  bad  enough,  but  some  other  arbitration  firms  are  even more  expensive.  The  American  Arbitration  Association  charges  a  $500  filing  fee  for  claims  of  less  than  $10,000,  or  more  if  the  claim  exceeds  $10,000,  and  a  minimum  filing  fee  of  $2,000  if  the  case  involves three or more arbitrators. In addition  to  the  filing  fee,  it  also  charges  a hearing fee for holding hearings other  than  the  initial  hearing\u2014$150  to  be  paid  by  each  party  for  each  day  of  hearings  before  a  single  arbitrator,  or  $250  if  the  hearing  is  held  before  an  arbitration  panel.  The  International  Chamber  of Commerce  requires  a  $2,500  administrative  fee  plus  an  arbitrator\u2019s  fee of at least $2,500, if the claim is less  than  $50,000.  These  fees  are  greater  if  the  claim  exceeds  $50,000.  The  fees  could  very  well  be  greater  than  the  consumer\u2019s claim. So, as you can see, a  consumer\u2019s  claim  is  not  necessarily  resolved  more  efficiently  with  arbitration.  It  is  resolved  either  at  greater  cost  to  the  consumer  or  not  at  all,  if  the  consumer  cannot  afford  the  costs,  or  the  costs  outweigh  the  amount  in  dispute.  Another  significant  problem  with  mandatory,  binding  arbitration  is  that  the  lender  gets  to  decide  in  advance  who  the  arbitrator  will  be.  In  the  case  of  American  Express  and  First  USA,  they have chosen the National Arbitration  Forum.  All  credit  card  disputes  with  consumers  involving  American  Express  or  First  USA  are  handled  by  that  entity.  There  would  seem  to  be  a  significant  danger  that  this  would  result  in  an  advantage  for  the  lenders  who  are  \u2018\u2018repeat  players.\u2019\u2019  After  all,  if  the  National  Arbitration  Forum  develops a pattern of reaching decisions that  favor cardholders, American Express or  First  USA  may  very  well  decide  to  take  their  arbitration  business  elsewhere.  A  system  where  the  arbitrator  has  a  financial  interest  in  reaching  an  outcome  that  favors  the  credit  card  company  is  not  a  fair  alternative  dispute resolution system.  There  has  been  one  important  court  decision  on  the  enforceability  of  mandatory  arbitration  provisions  in  credit  card  agreements. The  case  arose  out  of  a  mandatory  arbitration  provision  announced  in  mailings  to  Bank  of  America  credit  card  and  deposit  account  holders.  In 1998, the California Court of  Appeals ruled that the mandatory arbitration clauses unilaterally imposed on  the  Bank\u2019s  customers  were  invalid  and  unenforceable.  The  California  Supreme  Court  refused  to  review  the  decision  of  the lower court. As a result, credit card  companies  in  California  cannot  invoke  mandatory  arbitration  in  their  disputes  with  customers.

            "115": "S950  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE February 29, 2000  federal  government\u2019s  the  scope  of  the  responsibilities.  We  have  taken  great  strides  in  the  area  of  food  packaging  and  labeling,  pointing out  to  consumers vitamin and  fat  content;  caloric  and  cholesterol  facts. We  require  data  on  tests  done  on  artificial  sweeteners.  But,  in  a  product  that  threatens  the  life  of  one  out  of  three  regular  users,  we  ignore  those  basic principles.  Mr.  President,  we  all  know  that  in  a  food  product,  the  discovery  of  even  a  single carcinogen can trigger media attack,  consumer  outrage  and FDA  regulation.  However,  under  current  law,  a  cigarette  package  is  not  even  required  to  list  its  ingredients  despite  the  presence of dozens of carcinogens. Applying  a  simple  content  labeling  standard  to  tobacco  in  the  interest  of  consistency  and  public  health  is  overdue  considering  the  massive  health  problems  inflicted by tobacco.  As  Chairman  of  the  Senate  Committee  on  Agriculture,  Nutrition,  and  Forestry,  which  has  jurisdiction  over  some  aspects  of  tobacco,  I  believe  that  our  government  must  speak  consistently and clearly about tobacco\u2019s risks.  That  has  not  always  been  the  case.  In  the  past,  our  government  has  sent  mixed  messages,  for  example,  subsidizing  the  cultivation  of  tobacco  and  including  cigarettes  in  military  rations,  even  as  it  warned  against  tobacco\u2019s  dangers.  If  public  health  warnings  are  to  be  trusted,  they  should  not  be  ambiguous. The small, side-panel warnings  currently  in  use  on  tobacco  packages  are  not  adequate  in  reflecting  the  risks  of  tobacco  use  as  we  now  know  them. We  can  and  we  should  speak  the  truth with a clearer voice.  Prominent  labels  on  cigarette  packages in plain English would be a steady  reminder  of  the  risks  smokers  face  when they  light up. True, almost every  smoker understands that cigarettes are  bad  for  health,  but  fewer  know  the  degree of risk.  Many  smokers  have  tried  to  quit,  some more than once. These  labels will  encourage  them  in  this  endeavor  and  remind  them  why  they  should  try  again.  Most  importantly,  Mr.  President,  as  Senator  stated,  the  warnings  will  be  prominent  and  readily  understood  by  young  Americans,  thousands  of  whom  light  up  for  the  first  time every day.  This  bill  does  not  interfere  with  an  adult\u2019s  freedom  to  choose  to  smoke,  it  does  not  raise  tobacco  prices,  and  it  does  not  expand  government  regulatory  authority  beyond  the  labeling  requirement.  It  is  a  modest  and  conservative  step,  but  a  decisive  and  important step in good public policy.\u2211  Mr.  L.  CHAFEE. Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased  to  join  Senators  LAUand  today  in  introducing  the  Smoker\u2019s  Right  to  Know  and  Truth  in  Labeling  Act,  which  would  require  comprehensive  and  prominent  labeling  of  cigarettes.  This  legislation  is  a  commonsense  and  biLAUTENBERG TENBERG,  \u2211 LUGAR,  DURBIN every  Amerinformed  departisan  approach  to  give  ican  a  chance  to make  an  cision about tobacco use.  According  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control,  nearly  one  in  five  deaths  annually  are  attributed  to  tobacco  use,  making  it  the  single  most  preventable  cause  of  premature  death,  disease  and  disability  facing  our  nation.  In  fact,  more Americans die each year  from  tobacco  use  than  from  AIDS,  alcohol,  drug abuse, car accidents, murders, suicides, and fires combined.  America\u2019s  children  are  most  at  risk.  Despite  all  we  know  about  the  effects  of  tobacco,  each  day,  3,000 kids  become  regular  smokers.  Of  these,  1,000  will  eventually die from tobacco-related illnesses.  Almost  90  percent  of  current  adult  smokers  began  at  or  before  age  18.  Rhode  Island\u2014which  already  has  one  of  the highest  rates  of  teen  smoking  in  the  nation\u2014has  recently  seen  another  increase  in  teen  smoking.  Today,  over  37  percent  of  Rhode  Island\u2019s  high  school  kids  smoke  cigarettes.  Over  23,000  Rhode  Island  kids  under  age  18  will  die  prematurely  from  tobacco-related illnesses.  Tobacco  manufacturers  say  that  tobacco  use  is  a  matter  of  choice.  They  argue  that  adults,  with  the  full  knowledge  of  the  consequences,  have  the  right  to  choose  to  smoke.  I  agree.  But  I  also  believe  that  individuals  who  choose  to  smoke  should  be  making  informed decisions.  The  Smoker\u2019s  Right  to  Know  and  Truth  in  Tobacco  Labelling  Act  would  ensure  that  tobacco  users  understand  the consequences of the choice they are  making.  With  comprehensive  labelling  of  cigarette  packs,  adults  and  especially  minors,  will  know  the  dangers  that cigarettes pose to their health and  the health of their loved ones.  This  legislation  follows on the recent  example  set  by  Canada,  which  passed  tough  labelling  guidelines  that  have  worked  as  a  strong  disincentive  to  beginning  this  deadly  habit.  Under  the  legislation  we  are  introducing  today,  there will be no mistake about the life-  threatening  health  effects  of  tobacco  products.  As  the  father  of  three  young  children, I have a personal stake in helping  to  pass  legislation  to  ensure  that  our  kids do not develop this deadly habit.  I  hope  our  colleagues  in  the  Senate  will  join us  in  passing  this  important,  common-sense legislation.\u2211  STEIN,  KENNEDY,  By Mr.  HARKIN  (for  himself, Mr.  ROBB, Mr. BINGAMAN, Mrs. FEINMr.  Mr.  WELLSTONE, and Mr. DODD):  S. 2124. A bill to authorize Federal  financial assistance for the urgent repair  and  renovation  of  public  elementary  and  secondary  schools  in  high-need  areas;  to  the  Committee  on  Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.  THE PUBLIC SCHOOL AND RENOVATION  REPAIR ACT  Mr.  HARKIN.  Mr.  President,  today  we  will  be  introducing  the  Public  KENNEDY,  School  Repair  and  Renovation  Act.  This  legislation  will  authorize  $1.3  billion  in  grants  and  no  interest  loans  to  enable  school  districts  to  make  urgent  repairs at our nation\u2019s public schools. I  am  pleased  to  be  joined  by  Senators  ROBB,  BINGAMAN,  FEINSTEIN,  WELLSTONE,  DODD and  in  cosponsoring  this legislation in the Senate.  The  facts  about  the  condition  of  our  nation\u2019s  schools  are  well  known.  The  average age of the schools in this country  is  42  years.  14  million  children  attend  classes  in  buildings  that  are  unsafe  or  inadequate.  The  General  Accounting  Office  reports  we  need  $112  billion  to  just  bring  our  schools  up  to  overall  good  condition.  How  can  kids  prepare  for  the  21st  century  in  schools  that  didn\u2019t  even make  the  grade  in  the  20th century?  It  is  a  national  disgrace  that  the  nicest  thing  our  kids  see  are  shopping  malls,  sports  arenas,  and  movie  theaters,  and  the  most  rundown  place  they  see  is  their  school.  What  signal  are  we  sending  them  about  the  value we  place  on them, their education and future?  I  was  disturbed  by  the  comments  of  Tunisia,  a Washington,  D.C.  5th  grader  in  Jonathan  Kozol\u2019s  book,  \u2018\u2018Savage  Inequalities.\u2019\u2019 This is what she said.  It\u2019s  like  this.  The  school  is  dirty.  There  isn\u2019t  any  playground.  There\u2019s  a  hole  in  the  wall  behind  the  principal\u2019s  desk.  What  we  need to do  is  first rebuild the school. Build a  playground. Plant  a  lot  of  flowers. Paint  the  classrooms. Fix the hole in the principal\u2019s office.  Buy  doors  for  the  toilet  stalls  in  the  girl\u2019s  bathroom.  Make  it  a  beautiful  clean  building.  Make  it  pretty.  Way  it  is,  I  feel  ashamed.  The  legislation  we  are  introducing  would make  it  possible  to  fix  the  holes  in  the  walls  of  Tunisia\u2019s  school,  put  doors  on  the  bathroom  stalls  and  paint  the  classrooms.  These  repairs  would  make Tunisia  feel a  little  less ashamed  of herself and of her school.  This  legislation  is  part  of  a  comprehensive  two-prong  strategy  to  modernize  our  nation\u2019s  schools.  This  bill  complements  our  continuing  effort  to  provide  tax  credits  for  new  construction  and  modernization  projects.  We  have  advocated  school  modernization  tax  credits  that  would  finance  $25  billion  in  new  construction  or  major  renovations. The Public School Repair and  Renovation  Act  will  complement  that  effort  and  I  urge my  colleagues  to  support it.  By  Mr.  COCHRAN  (for  himself,  Mr. MOYNIHAN, and Mr. FRIST):  S.J.

(5) Furthermore, a  recent  study by  the Environmental  Working  Group  concluded  that  portable  trailers,  utilized  by  many  school  districts  to accommodate  school over-crowding,  can  \u2018\u2018expose  children  to  toxic  chemicals  at  levels  that  pose  an  unacceptable  risk  of  cancer  or  other  serious  illnesses.\u2019\u2019  Because  ventilation  in  portable  trailers  is  poor,  the  pollution  through  the  build-up  of  toxins  can  be significant. This is particularly hazardous  to  those  children  who  have  asthma.  The  prevalence  of  asthma  in  children  increased  by  160  percent  between  1980  and  1994. The  report  also  stated,  \u2018\u2018Schools  are  facing  two  epidemics:  an  epidemic  of  deteriorating  facilities  and  an  epidemic  of  asthma  among  children.\u2019\u2019  (6)  The  General  Accounting  Office  has  found  most  schools  are  not  prepared  to  incorporate  modern  technology  in  the  classroom.  Forty-six  percent  of  schools  lack  adequate  electrical  wiring  to  support  the  full-  scale use of technology. More than a third of  schools  lack  the  requisite  electrical  power.  Fifty-six percent of  schools have  insufficient  phone lines for modems.  (7)  The  Department  of  Education  has  reported that elementary and secondary school  enrollment,  already  at  a  record  high  level,  will  continue  to grow over  the next  10 years,  and  that  in  order  to  accommodate  this  growth,  the  United  States  will  need  to  build  an additional 2,400 schools.  (8)  The  General  Accounting  Office  has  determined  the  cost  of  bringing  schools  up  to  good,  overall  condition  to  be  $112,000,000,000,  not  including  the  cost  of  modernizing  schools  to  accommodate  technology,  or  the  cost  of  building  additional  facilities  needed  to meet record enrollment levels.  (9) Schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs  (in  this  section  referred  to  as  the  \u2018\u2018BIA\u2019\u2019)  for  Native  American  children  are  also  in  dire  need  of  repair  and  renovation.  The  General  Accounting  Office  has  reported  that the cost of total inventory repairs needed  for  BIA  facilities  is  $754,000,000.  The  December  1997  report  by  the  Comptroller  General  of  the  United  States  states  that,  \u2018\u2018Compared  with  other  schools  nationally,  BIA  schools are generally  in poorer physical  condition,  have  more  unsatisfactory  environmental  factors,  more  often  lack  key  facilities  requirements  for  education  reform,  and  are  less  able  to  support  computer  and  communications technology.\u2019\u2019  (10) Across the Nation, schools will need to  recruit and hire an additional 2,000,000 teachers  during  the  period  from  1998  through  2008.  More than 200,000 teachers will be needed annually, yet current teacher development programs produce only 100,000 to 150,000 teachers  per  year. This  level  of  recruitment  is  simply  the  level  needed  to  maintain  existing  student-teacher ratios.  (11)  The  rapid  growth  in  the  student  population,  in  addition  to  the  imminent  shortage  of  qualified  teachers  and  recent  efforts  by  Congress  to  help  States  reduce  class  size,  present  urgent  infrastructure  needs  across  the Nation.  (12)  State  and  local  financing  mechanisms  have  proven  inadequate  to  meet  the  challenges  facing  today\u2019s  aging  school  facilities.  Large  numbers  of  local  educational  agencies  have  difficulties  securing  financing  for  school facility improvement.  (13)  The  Federal  Government  has  provided  resources for school construction in the past.  For  example,  between  1933  and  1939,  the Federal Government  assisted  in  70  percent  of  all  new school construction.  (14)  The  Federal  Government  can  support  elementary  and  secondary  school  facilities  without interfering in issues of local control,  and  should  help  communities  leverage  additional  funds  for  the  improvement  of  tary and secondary school facilities.

            "131": "S966  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE February 29, 2000  Higdon grew up one of  four kids  in a house  off  Klondike  Lane  near  Hikes  Point.  His  father  was  a  photoengraver  at  the  old  Standard Gravure printing plant.  The Rev. David Zettel, a counselor at Trinity  High  School,  remembers  Hidgon  as  bright,  gregarious  and  outgoing.  \u2018\u2018He  smiled  a lot,\u2019\u2019 Zettle said.  Higdon  was  \u2018\u2018more  social  than  most  smart  guys.\u2019\u2019 and he had the ability to befriend any  group,  said  friend  Tom  Scanlon,  now  president of ScanSteel Service Center Inc. in Louisville.  Scanlon remembers exchanging words with  students  from  a  rival  school  in  the  parking  lot  one  night  after  a  football  game.  Then  Higdon walked over to them.  \u2018\u2018What  looked  like  it  was  going  to  turn  into a  fight, 30 minutes  later we were sitting  on  the  hood  of  their  car  drinking  beer  with  them,\u2019\u2019  Scanlon  said.  \u2018\u2018He  has  a  look  in  his  eye and you trust him.\u2019\u2019  Higdon  started  out  in  accounting  at  the  University of Kentucky but found marketing  more  to  his  taste.  \u2018\u2018It  was  exciting.  It  was  fun. It was creative,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You got these  marketing  problems  and  there were  30,  40,  50  different  ways  to  come  up  with  a  solution.\u2019\u2019  He had never been on a plane before, but on  a  whim  Higdon  left  a  summer  job  before  his  senior  year  to  fly  with  a  co-worker  to  Europe.  He  visited  13  countries  on  about  $4  a  day, he said, and discovered a personal maturity  and  a  love  of  travel  that  have  marked  his career since.  His  first  job  out  of  college  was  as  a  part-  time  baggage  handler  for  Piedmont  Airlines  in Louisville\u2014not  for  the  $6  an  hour, Higdon  said, but for the free flights, employees got if  the planes weren\u2019t full.  \u2018\u2018I flew 100,000 miles that year. We\u2019d fly out  to L.A.  for  ladies night at the Red Onion,  fly  to Miami  for  the  Super  Bowl,  all  we  did  was  travel\u2014it  was  so  much  fun,\u2019\u2019  he  said.  \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve  worked  for  an  airline  most  of  my  life  since.  Travel is the spice of life.\u2019\u2019  Even  the  full-time  jobs  at  Yellow  Freight  and  Emery  Worldwide  that  followed  had  a  touch  of  the  exotic  for  Higdon.  \u2018\u2018Every  piece  of  freight  had  a  destination  or  an  origin  in  cities all over the world,\u2019\u2019 he said.  He was a  sales manager  for  the  local office  of  Emery  parent  CF  Airfreight  when  UPS  won landing rights in Japan and hired him to  run  the  Louisville  office  of  its  new  UniStar  cargo  company.  His  charge  was  finding  enough  freight  customers  to  fill  the  overnight  package-delivery  jets  flying  to  and  from Japan.  \u2018\u2018I was one of the first people hired to a significant  management  position  from  outside  UPS,\u2019\u2019  Higdon  said.  \u2018\u2018In  less  than  two  years  this  was  the  most  profitable  of  their  40  offices in the U.S.\u2019\u2019  UPS  later  named  Higdon  the  first  marketing manager  of  its  own  air-cargo  division  and  had  him  create  its  first  air-passenger  charter service.  \u2018\u2018In  a  real  sense  I\u2019ve  been  like  a  corporate  entrepreneur,\u2019\u2019  Higdon  said.  \u2018\u2018Every  job  I\u2019ve  had  (with  UPS)  was  a  new  job.  I  never  went  into  a  position  where  I  was  replacing  somebody.\u2019\u2019  Doug  Kuelpman,  a  former  boss  at  UPS,  said Higdon  \u2018\u2018understands  the business world  and what has to be done. He has a knack.  \u2018\u2018I  never  had  to  tell  Steve  more  than  once  about  doing  something,  even  in  areas  where  he  may  not  have  felt  well-equipped  going  into it. He\u2019s the kind of guy who likes to put  his head down and charge.\u2019\u2019  In  1995, UPS  \u2018\u2018loaned\u2019\u2019 Higdon  to  the development partnership  to help  recruit  transportation-intensive  businesses.  Louisville  Mayor Dave Armstrong was county judge-executive  at  the  time  and  worked  with  Higdon  in  an  unsuccessful  attempt  to  lure  a  new  Harley-Davidson manufacturing  plant  to  the  area.  the  be\u2018\u2018We  were  out  of  the  picture  altogether\u2019\u2019  when  he  and  Higdon  went  to  work  on  the  project,  but  in  the  end,  \u2018\u2018we  were  barely  edged  out\u2019\u2019  by  Kansas  City,  Armstrong  said.  \u2018\u2018He did a great job with that.\u2019\u2019  Higdon  concentrated  on  a  strategy  for  attracting  high-tech  industries  and  recruited  seven  computer-repair  firms with  700  jobs  by  the end of 1996.  But  while  he  loved  his  work,  Higdon  said,  \u2018\u2018there  was  never  a  time  I  felt  this  is  where  I want  to be.\u2019\u2019 The  following year he went  to  Cobb  for  advice  on  starting  his  own  company.  Instead,  Cobb  hired  Higdon  to  head  business-attraction  efforts  of  what  had  come Greater Louisville Inc.  His first day on the job, Oct. 8, 1997, Higdon  told  Cobb  that  UPS  was  planning  to  expand  its  operations  and  was  seriously  considering  Columbus, Ohio, as the site.  That  conversation  resulted  in  five  months  of intensive negotiations that ended with the  announcement  that  the  $1  billion  expansion  and  its  6,000  jobs  were  ticketed  for  Louisville.  As  a  former  UPS  insider,  Higdon  had  \u2018\u2018a  good  sense  of  what  was  going  on\u2019\u2019  inside  the  company,  Cobb  said,  and  he  played  \u2018\u2018a  huge  role\u2019\u2019 in the negotiations\u2019 success.  Higdon is credited with helping develop the  innovative  Metropolitan  College  concept  that  lets  UPS  package  handlers  work  their  night shifts while attending college.  When Cobb  said  last  fall  that he wanted  to  step down as president and CEO, the board of  directors  decided  to  look  internally  for  a  successor,  said  Ed  Glasscock,  chairman  of  the  board\u2019s  search  committee.  The  aim  was  to maintain momentum and avoid a  long adjustment period under a new executive.  They chose Higdon.  \u2018\u2018It\u2019s  not  fair  to  characterize  it  as  Doug  naming his  successor. We  asked Doug  for his  recommendations,\u2019\u2019  Glasscock  said.  \u2018\u2018You  had a number of  independent business people  on  the  search  committee  who  reviewed  the  job  description  and  Steve\u2019s  background.  We  felt he matched up, not because Doug said he  was  the  perfect  candidate.  We  came  to  that  conclusion independently.\u2019\u2019  Choosing  a  successor  internally  is  not  unusual  in  corporations,  Higdon  said,  and,  under  Cobb,  Greater  Louisville  Inc.  adopted  the  corporate  model  in  its  structure  and  thinking.  \u2018\u2018That\u2019s  why  we\u2019re  successful,\u2019\u2019  he  \u2018\u2018The  mentality  is  we\u2019re  all  running  a  ness here.\u2019\u2019  Running  a  business\u2014his  own\u2014is  still  on  Higdon\u2019s  mind,  though  it\u2019s  been  pushed  into  the  indefinite  future.  He  said  he  is  committed to his new job for at least three years  and that has its rewards.  \u2018\u2018I love dealing with people more than anything,\u2019\u2019 he said.  \u2018\u2018Since  I was a kid  I  loved to  be out among people.\u2019\u2019\u2211  said.  busif  \u2211 A.  IN  MEMORY  OF  GEORGE  ATHANSON  Mr.  DODD.  Mr.  President,  on  January  11,  2000, with  the  passing  of George  A.  Athanson,  the  state  of  Connecticut  lost a faithful and companionate public  servant and one of its most colorful political  figures  in  recent memory.  Often  called  the  \u2018\u2018people\u2019s  mayor,\u2019\u2019  George  was  one  of  the  longest  serving  and  most  beloved  mayors  in  the  history  of  Hartford,  Connecticut.  I  would  like  to  take  a  few  moments  to  reflect  on  his  many contributions to the city of Hartford.  George  Athanson  was  a  product  the  city  he  came  to  love  and  serve  of  so  well. A Hartford-born son of Greek heritage,  he  attended  Hartford  Public  High School, where his intelligence and  personal  charm  won  him  the  admiration of his peers and  teachers alike. He  went  on  to  Amherst  College  where  he  graduated  cum  laude  with  a  degree  in  political  science.  Following  a  short  stint  in  the  Marines,  George  returned  to  academia,  this  time  to  the  University of Chicago  law  school where he  received  a  law  degree  in  1955.  George  would  also  earn  a  masters  in  international  relations  from  the  University  of Connecticut in 1958.  George\u2019s  love  for  his  home  town  and  affinity  for  learning  lead him  to  teaching  at  the  University  of  Hartford.  As  a  professor  of  history  and  political  science,  George  was  known  for  a  dramatic  flair  that  enlivened  his  classes\u2014  a  flair  that  George  would  bring  to  the  mayor\u2019s office with his election in 1971.  His  magnetic  personality,  energy,  creativity and verve  for the dramatic contributed  to  his  tremendous  popularity  and resulted  in one of the  longest mayoral tenures in Hartford\u2019s history, from  1971 to 1981.  He  considered  himself  a  liberal  Democrat  and  was  confident  that  government could play a role in solving social  and  economic  problems.  George  was  a  colorful  politician  with  a  flamboyant  style.  While  he  was  hard  working,  his  efforts were  often  overshadowed  by  the  creative  and  novel  actions  he  undertook  to  promote  the  city. On  one  occasion,  George  rowed  across  the  Connecticut River  holding  a  state  flag  and  dressed  as  George  Washington  to  protest  a  General  Assembly  vote.  On  another  occasion,  he  stepped  into  a  boxing ring with a Republican opponent to  raise  money  for  charity.  And  in  perhaps  his  best  known  act  of  political  theater,  George  showed  up  to  promote  development  at  Brainard  Airport  in  Hartford  dressed  as  the  Red  Baron  and  climbed  into  the  cockpit  of  a  bi-plane  for photographers.  It  wasn\u2019t  these  dramatics  that  made  George  Athanson  so  popular,  however,  but  his  underlying  dedication  to  the  city  of  Hartford.  He  humanized  the  mayor\u2019s  office.  George  was  a  man  of  great personal strength and he used his  talent  and  energy  to  bring  the  city  together.  He  built  and  maintained  lines  of  communication  among  the  city\u2019s  diverse  racial  and  ethnic  communities  and  in  the  process  became  the  people\u2019s  mayor.  It was fitting that in his final days in  office,  George  continued  what  had  become a tradition during his tenure, the  delivery  of  the  annual  New  Year\u2019s  poem.

JOHN  CONYERS,  JR. OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 29, 2000 Mr.  CONYERS.  Mr.  Speaker,  amazingly, today  yet  another  tragic  shooting  claimed  another promising  life. Not  far  from  my  district,  near  Flint  in  Mount Morris  Township,  a  six-year-old  girl  was  shot and  killed  by  a  classmate.  A  first  grader  had a gun and  shot a  classmate. These  tragedies  go  on  every  day.  Thirteen children  a  day  are  killed  by  gun  violence. Over 5,000  children  are  killed  every  year  because of guns  falling  into  the wrong hands. This madness must end. But,  because  the  Republican  leadership  insists  on  pandering  to  the  extreme  right  wing who  thinks  that  one  reasonable  gun  safety  law is one  too many,  the  insanity goes on. The  gun  safety  conference  has  not  met since  August  of  1999.  Today,  I  am  writing  for the  fifth  time  to  House  Judiciary  Committee Chairman  to  urge  the  Republican Leadership  to  stop  stalling  and  call  a  conference meeting. It  is  starting  to  hit  close  to  home  for  every Member  of  this  House,  Mr.  Speaker.  How many  more  senseless  killings  will  it  take  before  the  Republican  Leadership  acts?  How many  more  promising  young  lives  do  we  have to  lose? Quit  stalling.  Close  the  gun  show  loophole. Require  child  safety  locks.  Ban  the  importation of high  capacity ammunition  clips. HENRY HYDE f HONORING  MS.  ROSE  MARIE  OF  MORRIS,  IL BELL HON.  JERRY  WELLER OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 29, 2000 Mr.  WELLER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to honor  the  career  of  Ms.  Rose  Marie  Bell  of Morris,  IL,  for  the  nearly  seventeen  years  of service  she  has  put  forth  as  the Grundy County Circuit Clerk. In  1983,  Robert  T.  Williamson  retired  from his  duties  as  Grundy  County  Circuit  Clerk. Ms. Rose  Marie  Bell,  a  lifetime  resident  of  the County  Seat  of  Grundy  County,  was  wisely appointed  to  the  position.  The  Circuit  Clerk\u2019s seat  is  open  every  four  years,  which  means Ms.  Bell  was  elected  on  four  separate  occasions  before  retiring  in  December  of  1999. Three  of  the  four  elections  were  unopposed. This  shows  her  leadership  both  professionally and  in  the  community  have  been  cherished  by the good people of Grundy County. In  1988,  Ms.  Bell  had  the  uneniviable  task of  computerizing  and  automating  the  Circuit Clerk\u2019s  office.  She  led  her  office  through  this trying  and  difficult  time.  When  the  spirits  were low  in  the  office  she  would  comfort  her  workers  by  saying,  \u2018\u2018And  this  too  shall  pass.\u2019\u2019  Ms. Bell  told  the programmer  she wanted a  system where  a  deputy  clerk  could  type  in  the  court proceedings  from  within  the  courtroom  and they would automatically  transfer  to  the Clerk\u2019s office.  The  programmer  said  it  could  not  be done,  but  Ms.  Rose  Marie  Bell  insisted  on  the installation.  That  particular  system  was  used at  that  time  by many Clerks\u2019  offices  throughout the  state  and  the  code  to  access  the  record sheet  was  \u2018\u2018Rose01\u2019\u2019.  A  down  state  judge, upon  meeting  Ms.  Bell,  said  he  was,  \u2018\u2018pleased to  finally meet  \u2018Rose01\u2019.\u2019\u2019 Not  only  has  Ms.  Bell  served  the  public  in an  official  capacity,  she  was  also  the  founding force  of  \u2018\u2018Breaking  Away\u2019\u2019  which  is  a  victims  of domestic  violence  organization.  The  organization  provides  shelter,  counseling,  and  assistance  to women  and  their  children who  need  to detach  themselves  from  an  abusive  home  life. She  still  is  actively  involved  serving  as  President of  the organization. Along  with  being  a  mother  to  her  four  sons Timothy,  Daniel,  Jeffrey,  and  Gregory,  she was  also  known  as  \u2018\u2018Mother  Bell\u2019\u2019  to  her  staff in  times  of  crisis  both  personally  and  professionally.  She  truly  is  a  pillar  of  the  community, holding  a  County  office  for  17  years,  helping found  \u2018\u2018Break  Away\u2019\u2019,  being  a  mother  of  four and a  friend  to many. Mr.  Speaker,  I  find  it  fitting  and  appropriate to  recognize  and  congratulate  the  years  of service  Ms.  Rose  Marie  Bell  has  given  to  the Morris  community  and  the  people  of  Grundy County. f HONORING  THE  LATE  DUNSDON DOUGLAS  E. HON.  SCOTT  McINNIS OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 29, 2000 Mr.  MCINNIS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to take  a  moment  to  pause  and  remember  the life  of  a  man  who  meant  a  great  deal  to  the Western  Slope.  Sadly,  on  February  27,  2000, Colorado  said  goodbye  to  Douglas  Dunsdon. He was 81  years old. Douglas  spent  nearly  his  entire  life  in  the Glenwood  Springs  area.  When  the  United States  entered  World  War  II,  Douglas  joined the  United  States  Air  Force  and  was  stationed in  Edin,  England  with  the  8th  Air  Force,  100th Bomb  Group.  Douglas  flew  25  missions.  He earned  a  Distinguished  Flying  Cross,  two Presidential  Unit  Citations,  three  Battle  Stars, four  Air  Medals,  a  European  Theater  of  Operations  Medal  and  a  group  medal  from  the French  and  Polish  governments.  In  addition, Douglas  was  a  flight  instructor  for  six  months in  Flight  Control  Communications  in Bobbington, England. After  the  war,  Douglas  returned  to  Glenwood  Springs. He  influenced  the  community  in many  ways.  He  ran  the  bowling  alley,  now known  as  Dumont  Building.  He  and  his  father and  brother  built  the  Alpine  Apartments,  now he  also until  his the  Alpine  Professional  Building  and  worked  at  the  Shoshone  Power  Plant  retirement  in 1976. Douglas  was  an  active  member  of  the  Veterans  of  Foreign  Wars,  American  Legion, B.P.O.E. and was appointed National Aide-DeCamp  in  November  of  1966  and  was  Commander of  the VFW  for  three  terms. Douglas  was  also  a  wonderful  husband  and a  loving  father.  I  had  the  privilege  of  knowing Douglas  and  grew  up  with  his  children.  \u2018\u2018Mr. Dunsdon\u2019\u2019  was  a  very  kind  man  and  I  have many  fond memories of him and his  family. It  is  with  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  I  would  like to  offer  this  tribute  to  a  great  man  who  will  be sorely  missed  by  all  those  who  knew  him.  He was  truly  a  great  American  who  among  other things,  fought  for  the  freedom  that  we  enjoy today. f HONORING  THE  UPSTATE  LEAGUE  OF  GREENVILLE,  CAROLINA URBAN SOUTH HON.  JIM  DeMINT OF SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 29, 2000 Mr. DEMINT. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  remind  my  friends  in  this  chamber  that  freedom in  America  is  created  not  by  government,  but by  individuals  who  take  responsibility  upon themselves  and  share  in  the  responsibilities  of community.  When  citizens  take  this  responsibility,  local  people  keep  dollars,  decisions  and freedom  in  their  hands.  It  is  my  honor  several times  each  year  to  present  the  Congressional Spirit  of  Freedom  Award  to  members  of  the 4th  District  of  South  Carolina.  This  non-partisan  award  goes  to  individuals,  organizations, schools,  and  businesses  that  go  above  and beyond  the  call  of  duty  to  advance  the  spirit and  ideals  of  freedom  and  volunteerism  in service  to  the  communities  of  South  Carolina. It  is  my  pleasure  today  to  honor  one  such group,  the  Upstate  Urban  League  in  Greenville,  SC  that  has  embodied  these  ideals.  The Urban  League\u2019s  Pre-College  Enrollment/Talent Search  program  has  taken  the  initiative  in making  sure  every  Upstate  child  achieves  his or  her  full  potential.  They  have  done  this  by providing  SAT  workshops,  college  visitation tours,  and  financial  aid  workshops  for  disadvantaged  students,  all  without  relying  on government  funding.  In  1998  alone,  they helped  one  hundred  and  thirty-three  students raise  their  SAT  scores  by  as  much  as  two hundred  and  eighty  points.  I  commend  them for  their  work  that  helps  students  reach  their dreams  of  going  to  college  and  succeeding  in the  next  century.

LORETTA  SANCHEZ OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 29, 2000 Ms.  SANCHEZ.  Mr.  Speaker,  today  I  rise  to pay  tribute  to  the Reverend Canon Charles W. Sacquety  on  his  retirement  from  the  ministry of  the Episcopal Church. Reverend  Charles  was  born  in  Detroit, Michigan.  He  attended  the  University  of  Michigan where he  received a Bachelors of Arts degree  and  a  Masters  of  Arts  degree  in  Music. After  teaching  music  in  the  Ann  Arbor  Public Schools,  he  served  in  the  United  States  Army for  two  years  where  he  was  stationed  in  the Canal Zone, Panama. Upon  returning  from  his  tour  of  duty,  Reverend  Charles  attended  the  Church  Divinity School  of  the  Pacific  in  Berkeley,  California. Upon  completing  his  theology  courses,  Reverend  Charles  was  ordained  as  a  deacon  and priest  in  the  Diocese  of  Michigan.  He  served two  congregations  before  being  called  to  St. Mark\u2019s  Parish  in  Glendale,  California.  Reverend  Charles  then  moved  to  Germany  where he  served  as  Rector  of  the  Parish  Church  of Christ  the  King  in  Frankfurt.  After  six  and  a half  years, Reverend Charles was  again  called to  California  where  he  became  the  Rector  of St. Wilfrid\u2019s  in  July of 1978. Reverend  Charles  brought  so  many  gifts  to St.  Wilfrid\u2019s.  He  is  best-known  for  his  ebullient sense  of  humor  and  his  ability  to  reach  out  to the  members  of  the  parish  by  listening  to  their needs.  He  has  developed  and  implemented the  plans  for  construction  of  the  beautiful  new church  and  community  hall  which  now  bears his  name,  Sacquety  Hall.  Reverend  Charles was  a  friend  to  the  members  of  the  church. His  sermons  on  Sundays  touched  the  lives  of all  who  attended  with  his  inspirational  wisdom and his eloquent words. After  leaving  St.  Wilfrid\u2019s,  Reverend  Charles served as an Archdeacon  for  the Episcopal Diocese  of  Los  Angeles.  Reverend  Charles  will receive  an  Honorary  Doctorate  degree  of  Divinity  from  Church  Divinity  School  of  the  Pacific,  in Berkeley, California  this  year. Colleagues, please  join me  today as we  recognize  the  Rev.  Canon  Charles  W.  Sacquety on  his  many  years  of  ministry  and  the  many contributions  that  he  has  made  to  the  community  and  the  Episcopal  Church  and  to  the  parishioners  who  came  to  know  him  as  a man  of understanding and  inspiration. HONORING  MR.  MARK  MORELLI HON.  CURT  WELDON OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 29, 2000 Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I  rise  today  to  honor  a  man  whose  life-saving work  demands  our  attention  and  respect.  Mr. Mark  Morelli,  a  dedicated  member  of  the Folcroft,  Pennsylvania  Fire  Company  has  recently  been  honored  for  his  heroic work  during a  tragic  time.  I  come  before  my  colleagues  to recognize  the  heroic  efforts  to  Mr.  Morelli  and congratulate  him  for  being  awarded  the  Valor Award  by  the  Delaware  County  Firemen\u2019s  Association. Mr.  Morelli  is  being  honored  for  his  selfless efforts  during  last  September\u2019s  Hurricane Floyd  that  caused  destruction  up  and  down the  east  coast.  Mr.  Morelli  was  chosen  for  the Valor  Award  for  saving  the  lives  of  three  citizens  trapped  by  the  flooding waters. He  called upon  his  skills  gained  during  his  assignment with  the United  States Navy  by maneuvering  a rescue boat against  the overwhelming  currents to  ensure  the  safety  of  the  stranded  people. His  courageous  duties  went  beyond  the  call  of duty.  All  Americans  should  applaud  him  for  his efforts. Too  often  the  heroic  efforts  of  our  nation\u2019s volunteer  firefighters  go  unnoticed  by  the  public.  Mr.  Morelli\u2019s  actions  exemplify  the  spirit and  dedication  of  the  men  and  women  in  the fire  service.  At  a  time  when  many  lament  the absence  of  heroes  in  today\u2019s  society,  I  can  attest  that  we  can  find  role  models  right  in  our own backyards. As a  fellow  firefighter,  I applaud Mr. Morelli\u2019s unselfish  bravery.  I  want  to  extend  my  gratitude  to  him  for  putting  his  life  on  the  line  in order  to  secure  the  safety of  local  residents. f HONORING  GRAND  JUNCTION  CITIZEN  OF  THE  YEAR,  JAMIE  HAMILTON HON.  SCOTT  McINNIS OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES like  to Grand Jamie Tuesday, February 29, 2000 Mr.  MCINNIS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  take  a  moment  to  recognize  the  1999  Junction  Citizen  of  the  Year,  my  friend,  Hamilton. A  man  that  knows  no  end  when  it  comes  to serving  his  community,  Jamie  was  awarded the  Citizen  of  the  Year  award  by  the  Grand Junction  Chamber  of  Commerce.  He  has  donated  his  time  and  talents  to  a  list  of  over twenty-five  community and  state organizations. This  past  year  alone  Jamie  served  on  the Grand  Junction  Park  and  Recreation  Board, Community  Hospital  Board,  Sober  Grad  Committee,  Lions  Club,  Grand  Junction  Chamber of  Commerce,  JUCO  and  the  Board  of  Trustees  for  the State Colleges of Colorado. Jamie  and  his  wife,  Debbie,  share  a  dedication  to  the  community  that  does  not  stop  with boards  and  committees.  After  volunteering  all of  his  time  to  these  organizations,  Jamie  still finds  time  to  coach  little  league  baseball  and baseball  clinics  for area  youths. He  leads  by  example,  never  asking  an  employee  to  do  something  that  he  would  not  do himself.  This  outstanding  leadership  and  dedication  is  a  leading  factor  in  the  success  of Home  Loan  Insurance  where  Jamie  is  the CEO and President. It  is  with  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  I  would  like to  offer  this  tribute  to  a  great  community  leader  and  a  good  personal  friend,  Jamie  Hamilton,  in  honor  of  receiving  the  1999  Grand Junction  Citizen  of  the  Year  Award.  The Grand  Junction  community  owes  him  a  debt  of gratitude  for  his  leadership  and  selfless  service. f CONDEMNING  RACIAL  AND  CATHOLIC  BIGOTRY ANTIHON.  GRACE  F.  NAPOLITANO OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CONYERS,  JOSEPH JOHN CROWLEY,  Tuesday, February 29, 2000 Mrs.  NAPOLITANO.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am proud  to  be  a  co-sponsor  of  the  concurrent resolution,  introduced  by  my  colleagues  Jr.  and  that  condemns  the  discriminatory  practices  prevalent at  Bob  Jones  University  and  all  individuals who  espouse  similar  beliefs.  As  members  of  a diverse  society  who  desire  mutual  respect  for and  by  all,  we  should  never  let  bigotry  go  unchecked.  Bob  Jones  University  has  been  perpetuating  its  anti-Catholic  and  racially  bigoted practices  and  beliefs  for  decades.  It  is  about time  that  the  institution be  condemned. Bob  Jones University  claims  it  is neither  racist  nor  anti-Catholic.  However,  the  University\u2019s policies  and  preachings  create  an  environment where  it  is  permissible  to  view  those  of  different  religions  and  races  as  inferior.  Once that environment  is established, all other  forms of  discrimination  can  ensue.  In  my  own  state of  California,  we  have  witnessed  all  too  often what  such  an  environment  can  lead  to:  police brutality,  such  as  that  endured  by  Rodney King;  the  passage  of  harsh  anti-immigrant measures,  such  as  proposition  187;  and  the grinding,  persistent  prejudice  that  blocks  too many  hardworking  families  and  individuals from  realizing  their  full potential. Many  people  throughout  California  and across  the  nation  have  been  working  hard  to counteract  the  damage  done  by  thoughts  and acts  of  hatred  and  intolerance.  At  a  time  when we  as  a  nation  should  be  focusing  our  efforts on  healing  our  wounds,  it  is  troubling  that  an academic  institution  would  be  dedicated  to  unraveling  the  fabric  of  our  multicultural  society. Our  nation  will  only  be  weakened  if  we  fail  to speak  out  against  policies  that  seek  to  divide, segregate  and  denigrate  people  on  the  basis of  race or  religion. f HONORING  JUDGE  GERALD SNODGRASS HON.

Karen,  a  native  of  Gary,  recalls showing  her  seventh  grade  report  card  to  her father.  Her  grades  included  5  \u2018\u2018A\u2019s\u2019\u2019  and  one \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019.  After  indicating  his  pleasure,  her  father told  her  if  she  brought  up  the  \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019  and  continued  to  work  hard,  she  could  achieve  any  goal she  could  conceive.  She  became  the  1978 valedictorian  for  Gary  Roosevelt  High  School, the  first  in  her  family  to  attend  college,  and  in 1985,  a  graduate  of  Harvard  Law  School.  She then  returned  to  her  home  in  Lake  County  to confront  new  challenges  as  a  deputy  prosecutor  and  later  a  public  defender.  From  1989 to  1992,  she  headed  the  Indiana  Civil  Rights Commission,  guiding  legislation  which  made Indiana  the  first  state  in  the  nation  to  pass  fair housing  laws  aligned  with  the  federal  government\u2019s.  She  also  brought  Indiana  law  into alignment  with  the  Americans  with  Disabilities Act.  Karen was  appointed  a Gary Circuit Court judge  in  1994,  the  first  African-American  to serve  in  that  position.  As  a  judge,  she  developed  programs  to  combat  drug  addiction, gang  involvement  and  teen  smoking.  In  addition,  she  has  worked  with  Gary  pediatrician Dr.  Steve  Simpson  to  establish  a  home  for  babies born addicted  to  crack  cocaine. On  February  21,  2000,  Karen  Freeman-Wilson  confronted  her  latest  challenge  when  she was  appointed  to  be  the  youngest  Indiana State  Attorney  General.  As  Attorney  General, Karen  vows  to  continue  her  efforts  to  protect children,  the  elderly,  and  victims  of  rape  and domestic  violence, while  providing  quality  legal representation of all  the people of  Indiana. Karen  clearly  states  that  she  owes  her  personal  and  professional  success  to  many  influential  leaders  and  activists who  paved  the way before  her.  Now,  Karen  Freeman-Wilson  is paving  the  way  for  young  African-American children  to  confront  and  conquer  new  challenges. I  would  also  like  to  draw  your  attention  to two  distinguished  African-American  youths who  have  emerged  victorious  after  facing many  difficulties  and  will  lead  us  into  the  21st century.  Dominic  Adams,  a  junior  at  Lew  Wallace  High  School  in  Gary,  is  currently  serving as  a  Congressional  page.  Dominic  is  a  member  of  the male  role model  program  at  his  high school,  head  of  the  school  newspaper,  and  a member  of  the  Christ  Baptist  Church  youth choir. Another  distinguished  young  person  is  Andrea  Ledbetter,  a  senior  at  Emerson  High School  in  Gary.  She  recently  won  a  national Target  scholarship.  Andrea  is  involved  in many  activities  including  the  Gary  Youth NAACP  Chapter,  U.S.  People  to  People  Student  Ambassador  Program,  Big  Brothers/Big Sisters  Program,  Academic  Super  Bowl  team, and  Governor  O\u2019Bannon\u2019s  Indiana  Point  of Youth  Program.  As  a  part  of  a  citywide  Stopthe-Violence  rally  in  Gary,  Andrea  was  instrumental  in  recruiting  cheerleaders  from  each  of the  area  high  schools  to  provide  routines aimed at  increasing  the peace.  In addition, Andrea  is  an  outstanding  academic  student, ranked  number  one  in  her  class  with  a  grade point  average  of  4.10  on  a  four-point  scale. Andrea  and  Dominic  are  fine  representatives of  their  high  schools  in  Gary,  of  Indiana\u2019s  First Congressional  District,  and  of  Future  AfricanAmerican  leaders.

WALTER  B.  JONES OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 29, 2000 Mr.  JONES  of  North  Carolina.  Mr.  Speaker, North  Carolina  has  produced  many  notable  individuals  and  accomplishments.  From  Andrew Jackson  to  Michael  Jordan  and  from  the  first American  born  child  to  first  in  flight.  North Carolina  has  a  lot  to  brag  about.  There  is  one North  Carolinian  in  particular  who  I  wish  to  remember  today,  Mr.  Benjamin  Franklin  Waters. Mr.  Benjamin  Waters  was  from  the  small town  of Dover, which  is  located  in  historic Craven  County,  North  Carolina.  In  1907  Mr.  Waters  received  a  patent  for  a  revolutionary  new invention, which  he  called  \u2018\u2018the  endless  chain.\u2019\u2019 The  principle  behind  his  invention  is  used today  as  the  tracks  of  our  amphibious  military tanks  and  in  machinery  such  as  farm  equipment. Mr.  Waters  invented  the  \u2018\u2018endless  chain\u2019\u2019  as a  useful  improvement  for  boats.  The  original patent  specifications  give Mr. Waters  credit  for \u2018\u2018propelling  mechanism  . . .  comprise(d  of  an) endless  chain  of  propeller  blades  which  travel about  and  below  the  boat  and  which  are  so constructed  that  water  will  be  prevented  from getting  behind  the  blades  and  thereby  retarding  the progress of  the boat.\u2019\u2019 As  is  often  the  case,  it  was  only  by  accident that  Mr.  Waters  realized  the  potential  use  for his  invention  on  land.  He  and  his  brother, Frank  Waters,  who  had  helped  him  build  his invention,  were  out  testing  their  model  one Sunday  afternoon  using  a  clock  spring  as  a power  source.  They  placed  the  boat  into  the water  and  sent  it  to  the  other  side,  only  to have  the  boat  quickly  run  up  the  bank  and onto  land.  This  amazing  discovery  led Mr. Waters  to  begin  work  on  obtaining  a  new  patent for use of his  invention on  land. Unfortunately,  plans  for  the  new  patent were not  completed  before  Mr.  Waters  was  tragically  killed  at  the  age  of  35.  He  was  deaf  and did  not  hear  the  oncoming  train  that  would take  his  life  as  he  attempted  to  cross  the  railroad  tracks.  His  family  claims  that  Mr.  Waters\u2019 workshop  was  broken  into  and  all  of  his  drawings  and  sketches  stolen  soon  after  his  death. Thus  he  never  received  credit  for  invention\u2019s capability  and  utility  on  land.  In  1924  the  right to his patent on water also expired. However,  today,  the  \u2018\u2018endless  chain\u2019\u2019  lives on  in  daily  use  by  our  military,  our  farmers, and our  industires.  I wish  to officially  recognize Mr.  Benjamin  Franklin  Waters  and  thank  him for  his  ingenuity  in  providing  us  the  principles of  the  \u2018\u2018endless  chain.\u2019\u2019 INDIA  TRIES  TO  FALSELY  IMPLICATE  SIKHS  IN  MURDER  OF CHRISTIAN  MISSIONARY  BY USING  ALIAS  \u2018\u2018SINGH\u2019\u2019 HON.  JOHN  T.  DOOLITTLE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 29, 2000 Mr.  DOOLITTLE.  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Tribune newspaper  of  India  reported  on  February  9 that  the  Indian  government  has  identified  the killer  of  Christian  missionary  Graham  Staines as  Dara  Singh,  but  his  real  name  is  Rabinder Kumar  Paul.  The  use  of  \u2018\u2018Singh\u2019\u2019  is  a  smear against  the  Sikhs  designed  to  create  the  impression  that  Sikhs  were  somehow  responsible  for  the  Staines murder  and  put  the Christians  against  the  Sikhs,  promoting  India\u2019s  divide-and-rule  strategy against minorities. The  facts  do  not  support  this.  Staines,  an Australian missionary,  and  his  two  young  sons were  burned  to  death  in  their  jeep.  They  were surrounded  by  a  mob  of  militant  Hindus  affiliated  with  the  RSS,  which  is  the  parent  organization  of  the  ruling  BJP.  These  fundamentalist Hindus  chanted  \u2018\u2018Victory  to  Hannuman,\u2019\u2019  a Hindu  god,  while  the  Staines  family\u2019s  jeep burned.  Yet  India  wants  to  create  the  impression  that  one  person  was  responsible  for  this brutal murder and  that he  is a Sikh. Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  offended  by  this  open manipulation  of  both  Christians  and  Sikhs.  Apparently,  India  is  concerned  about  the  support that  leaders  of  the  freedom  movements  of South  Asia  have  showed  for  each  other.  So they  have  resorted  to  this  divisive  strategy  to preserve  their empire. The  time  has  come  for  America,  the  beacon of  freedom,  to  take  strong  measures  to  stop India  from  pursuing  this  campaign  to  turn  one minority  against  another.

Then  we  must  declare  our support  for  free  and  fair  plebiscites,  under international  supervision,  on  the  question  of independence  for  Punjab,  Khalistan,  for  Kashmir, and  for Nagaland. Pitting  one  group  against  the  other  to  maintain  a  corrupt,brutal  tyranny  is  not  a  democratic or a moral way  to behave. f HONORING  KING  HUSSEIN  QUEEN  NOOR  OF  HASHEMITE  KINGDOM  OF  DAN AND THE JORHON.

The second point is in question #3, where you state how the point of order would apply to a continuing resolution. you seem to state that  a  short  term  continuing  resolution would  not  be  affected  by  the  section  106 points  of  order.  Short  term  C.R.s  are  meant to  be  a  noncontroversial  band-aid  so  Congress  can  work  on  the  larger  appropriation bills. However, your last sentence in your response  to  question  #3  states  that  if  a  C.R. \u2018\u2018were  to  attempt  to  undermine  the  funding guarantees  in  AIR  21,  then  the  points  of order  in  section  106  would  be  at  issue.\u2019\u2019 Would  our  typical  short  term  C.R.  \u2018\u2018undermine  funding  guarantees,\u2019\u2019  or  do  you  mean the long term, year-long C.R.s? RESPONSES CHAIRMAN OBERSTAR TO FOLLOW-UP SHUSTER AND QUESTIONS FROM RANKING MEMBER Follow up to Question #1 We believe that the point of order would be triggered  by  any  action  that  would  directly or  indirectly  cause  budget  resources  to  be less  than  set  forth  in  AIR  21.  We  mean  indirect  to  refer  to  any  action  that  might  be taken  which  would  undermine  the  funding guarantee.  There  are  many  ingenious  ways that could be devised to undermine the funding  guarantee,  and  we  want  the  point  of order to apply to any action which would accomplish this. For  example,  an  amendment  which  would have  the  effect  of  deeming  an  operations  account  activity  to  be  a  facilities  and  equipment  account  activity  would  be  an  indirect way of undermining the guarantee. Follow-up to Question #3 Technically,  the  points  of  order  in  Section 106 of AIR 21 apply to any continuing resolution  funding  FAA  programs.  In  the  circumstance  of  the  typical  short-term  continuing resolution making appropriations for days  or  a  few  weeks  at  the  start  of  a  fiscal year  while  Congress  completed  its  work,  we would  not  raise,  nor  would  we  object  to  a rule  waiving  the  points  of  order.  In  the  case of  a  longer  continuing  resolution,  we  would have  to  evaluate  them  on  a  case-by-case basis.  As  we  have  stated,  the  intent  of  the points of order is to prevent undermining the funding guarantees  in AIR 21. We would  look at  any  longer  CR  to  determine  if  it would  in practice undermine the funding guarantees. I  of the  reserve  balance  Mr.  Speaker,  my time. Ms.  SLAUGHTER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I thank  my  colleague  for  yielding  me this  30  minutes  and  yield  myself  such time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  this  resolution  waives all  points  of  order  against  the  conference report and its consideration. Mr.  Speaker,  I  support  the  underlying  bill  and want  to  praise  the  chairman  and  the  ranking  member  of  the Committee  on  Transportation  and  Infrastructure,  as  well  as  the  chairman and  the  ranking  member  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Aviation,  for  the  extraordinary  work  that  they  have  done to  ensure  that  America\u2019s  aviation  system  will  remain  safe  and  competitive as we enter the 21st century. Generations  of  taxpayers  have  spent millions  of  dollars  ensuring  that  our aviation  system  is  the  envy  of  the world,  but  that  superiority  is  by  no means certain unless we act. Many  communities  now  find  themselves  cut  off  from  the  booming  economy  as  a  result  of  the  inability  to move  their  goods  and  services  where they need to go. This problem has enorb mous  economic  implications  for  certain  regions  of  the  country,  including my own. I have said it before and I will say  it  again,  that  economic  development  cannot  occur  without  affordable, accessible air transportation. My  district  of  Rochester,  New  York, and,  of  course,  my  great  interest  in Buffalo is the largest per capita exporting  city  in  the  United  States  and  last year  1.2  million  people  flew  out  of  our airport. My district, Rochester,  contains Fortune  500  companies  such  as  Eastman Kodak,  Xerox  Corporation,  Johnson  & Johnson,  and  Bausch  and  Lomb.  Of equal  importance  are  the  hundreds  of small  and  mid-sized  high  technology firms that have been growing in our region  over  the  past  several  years. These companies  are  now  critical  to  the  lifeblood  of  our  community,  but  many firms  are  either  moving  out  or  choosing  to  expand  in  other  regions  of  the country  due  to  exorbitant  airfares  and the  inability  to  get  a  decent  flight schedule. A  relatively  young  and  growing Rochester-based  firm  recently wrote  to me  that  high  airfares  to  and  from Rochester  are  the  primary  reason  that it  froze  professional  positions  in  its local office and opted instead to expand its mid-Atlantic offices. 1030 Trends like this can and do enormous damage  to  any  community.  Rochester is  like  many  mid-sized  communities that  somehow  got  left  out  of  the  benefits  promised  by  deregulation.  To  be blunt,  deregulation  failed  us.  During the  1960s,  13  air  carriers  served  our  region,  affording  consumers  choices  and creating  a  competitive  environment and  produced  reasonable  fares.  Now there  is  one  dominant  carrier,  four  additional  carriers  and  a  few  very  small ones  that  effectively  serve  our  region, and  my  constituents  pay  some  of  the highest air fares in the country. Major  airline  carriers  have  clipped the  wings  of  any  start-up  carrier,  and while  more  than  one  carrier  may  service  our  region,  they  do  not  compete among  themselves  on most  routes. The result  has  been  the  creation  of  a  de facto  monopoly  on  individual  routes that  are  gouging  business  people  and consumers when they  fly. For example, Mr.  Speaker,  one  can  fly  from  Rochester to Chicago round trip for $1,200 to the  penny  on  any  airline  serving Rochester that will take you there. Congress  can  and  must  level  the playing  field  for  start-up  carriers  so that  they  can  compete  with  the  major carriers. Low-cost airlines formed after deregulation  are  the  primary  source  of price  competition  in  other  areas  of  the country,  and  Rochester  is  a  prime  example  of  what  happens  without  this pressure. Two  years  ago  I  pledged  to  my  constituents to confront this problem head on  in  the  Congress.  I  authored  legislation  and  called  on  the  Department  of Transportation  and  the  Department  of Justice  to  get  tough  on  the  predatory behavior of major carriers. I have testified  numerous  times  before  my  House and  Senate  colleagues  and  conducted hearings  in  Rochester  with  Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater. As  we  are  here  today,  the  Department  of  Justice  has  launched  a  fullblown  antitrust  investigation  into  the behavior of the major carriers. The Department  of  Transportation  for  the first  time  in  20  years  is  looking  at measures  to  prevent  anticompetitive behavior.  Thirty-six  States\u2019  Attorneys General are pressing  their State  courts into action, and comprehensive  legislation  before  us  today  will  provide  additional  airport  capacity  and  help  to  improve  large  and  small  airports  to  ensure that we have fair competition. Moreover,  a  new  start-up  airline, JetBlue,  will  be  serving  Rochester  in the coming year.  I was pleased  to be  in Buffalo  for  their  inaugural  flight  to New  York  City,  and  I  was  also  pleased to  help  ensure  JetBlue\u2019s  access  to  the slot-controlled  John  F.  Kennedy  Airport  in  New  York  City  and  look  forward to the relief their flights will provide in our community. Let  me  speak  a  moment  about  the slot  issue,  although  this  has  been  alleviated  in  this  report. Slots  refer  to  the landing  and  take-off  rights  for  each flight.  The  slot  provisions  included  in the  underlying  bill  are  critical  to  this debate,  and  I  am  delighted  that  the measure  begins  to  undo  the  damage created by the current system. Currently,  major  carriers  have  a stranglehold  on  these  slots,  effectively preventing  low-cost  carriers  from  entering the market. In the 18 years since airline  deregulation,  major  airlines have  increased  their  grip  on  access  to slots  at  major  airports.  The  four  slotcontrolled  airports  in  the  country, LaGuardia  and  Kennedy  Airports  in New  York,  O\u2019Hare  in  Chicago  and  National  Airport  near  Washington,  the dominant  airlines  use  their  control  of slots  to  squeeze  out  the  smaller  carriers  and  consumers  are  being  crushed in the process. When  these  slots  were  first  distributed,  DOT  made  clear  to  the  airlines the  slots  were  government  property owned  by  the  American  people.  The government  reserved  the  right  to  reclaim them at a future date to promote fair  competition.  With  the  growing move  by  large  airlines  to  consolidate slots,  this action  is  long overdue, and  I am delighted to see it in this bill. Mr.  Speaker,  again,  I  want  to  commend  the  chairman  and  ranking  member  of  both  the  Committee  on  Transportation  and  Infrastructure  and  the Subcommittee  on  Aviation  for  their extraordinary  work  and  for  standing firm  in  the  conference  on  our  behalf.  I will not  call  for a  recorded vote.  I urge my  colleagues  to  support  the  legislation  that  the  resolution  makes  in order. Mr.  Speaker,  my time. balance  reserve  the  of I  ",

Mr.  Speaker,  this  legislation  is  nothing  less  than  a  great  tribute  to  our chairman,  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.  He  has  been  a warrior for keeping faith with the traveling  public,  whether  highways, transitways  or  airways,  and  for  fully investing  the  trust  funds,  the  revenues that  we  agreed  to  tax  people  for  to  deposit  in  trust  funds  for  surface  and  air transportation;  to  make  sure  that those  funds  are  invested  as  intended  in the  compact  between  the  traveling public and its government. worked legislaFAA: FeldCounsel:  David Keith Mike Brett the  balance  of SHUSTER).  He has been a  champion, and  I  salute him  for  the  success  he  has  achieved here in negotiating between the Senate and  the  House,  the  role  that  we  together  played  with  the  administration in  coming  to  this  agreement,  and  to achieving this outcome that will result in  significantly  greater  investment  in aviation  from  those  taxes  derived  from the traveling public. It is also fitting that this is a tribute to  former,  now  retired,  Senator  Wendell  Ford.  It  was  my  great  pleasure  to work  with  Senator  Ford  for  many years  on  aviation  issues,  during  which I came to have a great appreciation  for his  dedication  to  improving  air  travel, capacity,  safety,  and  security.  His  persistent  country,  down-home  wisdom and  his  folk  humor  kept  us  always  on track  and  on  message,  and  he  deserves the recognition of having this bill, ultimately this law, named in his honor. Aviation  is  the most  rapidly  growing sector  of  our  Nation\u2019s  economy.  It  is, in  fact,  a  $600  billion  sector  of  our economy.  It  is  the  element  that makes America  a  leader  worldwide  in  technology.  Every  modern  nation  on  the face  of  this  earth,  every  industrialized country,  every  country  seeking  to  be an  industrialized  nation  patterns  its aviation  development  after  the  United States. They  want  to  acquire  our  air  traffic control technology, they want to  fly to our shores, to our airports, and operate in  our  airspace.  They  want  to  be  a partner  with  us,  whether  it  is  code sharing  or  in  development  of new  technology  or  investment  in  airports.  We are  the  leader.  But  we  will  not  be  the leader  if  we  do  not  make  the  investments  in  modernizing  the  air  traffic control  system,  if  we  do  not  make  the investment  in  expansion  of  our  airport capacity. We will not be able  to handle the  growth  that  is  projected  toward  a billion  air  travelers  in  the  U.S.  airspace alone. Today,  worldwide,  over  a  billion  people  travel  by  air,  but  650  million  of those  travel  in  the  U.S.  airspace.  That means  that  nearly  two-thirds  of  all  air travel  in the entire world occurs  in the U.S.  airspace,  and  that  is  the  safest airspace  in  the  world.  And  it  does  not happen by accident.  It happens because year  after  year  the  FAA  does  its  job overseeing  the  airlines,  the  airlines  do their  part,  and  our  air  traffic  control system maintains  safety  in  the  air  and on the ground for aircraft maneuvering at airport terminals. But  we  cannot  expect  to  make  those investments  in  expansion  of  airside  capacity,  in  runways  and  taxiways,  or  in the  efficiency  of  the  air  traffic  control system  without  sustained  investment, without  a  dedicated  revenue  stream; and  this  legislation  gives  us  that  dedicated revenue stream. Mr. Speaker, I want to make just one comment  about  the  high-density  rule which  was  discussed  during  debate  on the  rule.  Lifting  of  the  high-density rule  under  this  legislation,  ultimately, in  2  years  at  O\u2019Hare,  will  mean  new ",

Yet today we break that promise. The  Washington  region,  D.C.,  Maryland,  and  Virginia  fulfilled  its  part  of the  bargain.  It  said  we  will  fund  the airports and be responsible for their administration  and  redevelopment.  We fulfilled  our  part  of  the  bargain,  and now  Congress  breaks  its  part  of  the bargain. It  is  wrong.  I  know  what  happened,  I know  the  guy  that  is  responsible.  But it  is  irresponsible  for  us  to  do  this. We ought  not  set  a  tradition  of  breaking promises.  Our  word  ought  to  be  good. We  had  an  iron-clad  agreement.  This breaks  that  agreement  by  adding  24 more  slots,  12  of  them  beyond  the  perimeter  rule.  Those  slots  should  be  at Dulles  Airport,  not  at  National  Airport,  and  that  is  why  I  have  to  vote against this bill. Mr.  SHUSTER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am pleased  to  yield  30  seconds  to  the  gentleman  from  Idaho  (Mr.  who serves  on  the  Committee  on  Transportation  and  Infrastructure  with  distinction. Mr.  SIMPSON.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  want to  congratulate  the  chairman  and  the ranking  member  for  their  diligent work  in  making  sure  that  this  bill came  to  pass,  this  conference  report.  I rise  in  its  support.  It  is  critical  to Idaho,  not  only  the  general  aviation airports,  but  also  to  the  commercial airports in Idaho. Unlike  the  previous  speaker,  I  am very  pleased  that  we  have  decided  to extend  the  perimeter  rule  at  Washington  National  Airport  to  those  of  us in the Western United States. It is critical.  I  hope  that  some  of  those  slots that  will  be  made  available  will  be made  available  to  the  inter-mountain region\u2019s most important airport in Salt Lake City. Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  chairman for his work on this legislation. Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  congratulate Chairman  and  Ranking  Member on  the  success  of  their  determined efforts  to  enhance  our  nation\u2019s  commitment  to a  safe  and  effective  air  transportation  system. Not  only  does  this  Conference  Report  provide  landmark  funding  levels  for  augmenting and  modernizing  airport  facilities,  its  multi-year reauthorization  of  the  Airport  Improvement Program  breaks  the  cycle  of  short-term  reauthorizations  that  has  made  safety-  and  capacity-enhancing  projects  at  airports  such  as  the Boise  Air  Terminal  in  my  district  needlessly difficult and  costly. Particularly  important  to  the  citizens  of  rural districts  such  as  my  own  are  the  provisions which  guarantee  AIP  funding  for  general  aviation  airports  for  the  first  time.  These  small  facilities  represent  the  backbone  of  Idaho  aviation,  and  this  legislation  secures  them  the flexibility  of  funding  they  need  to  continue  to play  a  vital  role  in  agriculture,  firefighting,  and wilderness access  in my district. Another  aspect  of  the  conference  report which  I  and  many  fellow  Western  members strongly  support  is  the  provision  which  allows exemptions  for  underserved  communities  to the  current  Perimeter  Rule  at  Ronald  Reagan OBERSTAR SHUSTER Washington  National  Airport.  I  commend  the conferees  on  creating  a  process  which  I  believe  fairly  balances  the  interests  of  states  inside  the  Perimeter  and  those  of  us  from Western  states  without  convenient  access  to Reagan National. With  12  new  slots  at  Reagan  National,  this report  represents  a  slight  loosening  of  the  restrictive  conditions  that  prevail  at  one  of  our nation\u2019s  most  important  airports.  These  limited exemptions  to  the  perimeter  rule  from  hubs like  Salt  Lake  City  will  improve  service  to  the nation\u2019s  capital  for  dozens  of  Western  cities beyond  the  Perimeter\u2014while  at  the  same  time ensuring  that  cities  inside  the  Perimeter  are not adversely  impacted by new  service. This  is a  fair  balance  which  is  consistent  with  the overall  intent  of  the  bill  to  improve  air  service to  small and medium-sized  cities. Throughout  consideration  of  this  bill,  our goal  has  been  to  ensure  truth  in  budgeting  for the  Aviation  Trust  Fund  and  to  improve  air service  for  communities  which  have  not  experienced  the  benefits  of  deregulation  to  the same  extent  as  larger  markets.  By  refusing  to accept  a  short-term  reauthorization  of  FAA programs  that  would  have  interrupted  the  momentum  for  these  much-needed  reforms, Chairman  and  Ranking  Member achieved  a  remarkable  sucOBERSTAR SHUSTER have  for  SHUSTER),  BOSWELL),  OBERSTAR),  DUNCAN),  cess. Airports  are  key  components  to  our  regional economies  and  critical  links  to  the  world  outside  our  communities.  I  support  the  Aviation Investment  and  Reform  Act  because  it  protects  the  investments  we  have  made  in  these important  facilities,  and  helps  underserved communities  take  full  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  our  nation\u2019s  air  transportation  system.  I urge my  colleagues  to do  the  same. Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker,  I yield 11\u20442 minutes  to  the  distinguished  gentleman  from  Iowa  (Mr.  an aviator  and  strong  advocate  aviation. (Mr.  BOSWELL  asked  and  was  given permission  to  revise  and  extend  his  remarks.) Mr.  BOSWELL. Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr. the  gentleman  from  Minnesota  (Mr.  the  gentleman from  Tennessee  (Mr.  and  the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.  LIPINSKI) for their leadership. I have a lot of  confidence  in  them.  The  times  we have  talked  and  traveled  together,  we talked  about  this  thing;  I  know  they are  in  the  game  and  are  concerned about  this  fact  that  we  have  got  tremendous  demands  for  increased  traffic, both  in  people,  personnel  and  freight. And we have got to deal with it, and we appreciate that. Airport  improvements,  ATC  equipment,  longer  runways,  terminals, whatever,  the  infrastructure has got  to be  there  to  accommodate  these  things. But  I  am  concerned  about  the  people.  I know these gentlemen are too. I do not even  have  to  ask,  I  know  they  are.  I think that was one of the things we fell a little short in. I  am  going  to  support  this,  but  I  am going  to  expect  me  to  be  diligent  and continue  to  watch  this  side  of  it,  and  I know  that  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Chairman  will,  as SHUSTER)  the  I yield OBERSTAR),  will  gentleman  from  Minnesota (Mr.  that  we  watch  this  to be  sure  that  this  does  not  get  pushed back  somewhat.  So  I  trust  we  can  do that. The  question  of  slots  is  worrisome. Ms. Garvey, the Secretary of Transportation,  says  this  is  not  a  safety  problem.  They  can  work  with  this.  Folks from  our  part  of  the  country,  we  need some  help  and  relief.  I  also  have  confidence  that  we  will  continue  to  work on that. Advanced  out  to  2007,  I  hear  people already  working  on  trying  to  advance it  out  even  further,  so  we  have  to  be watching  for  this  very  much.  I  trust that we will. So  let  us  support  this.  Let  us  grow aviation.  It  is  very  important  to  our country\u2019s  economy.  Let  us  get  on  with it.  I  look  forward  to  continuing  dialogue on these things that I am a  little bit worried about. Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker,  myself the balance of my time. Mr.  Speaker,  the  appropriators  come to  the  floor  fulminating  that  we  have made  aviation  the  highest  priority. \u2018\u2018Before all others,\u2019\u2019 they said. Well,  not  before  all  other  issues  that have  a  trust  fund.  Housing  does  not have a trust fund. If it did, we would be advocating  the  same  thing.  My  good colleague  from  Minnesota  said  he would  like  to  put  other  issues  in  the care  of  our  committee.  Give  them  to us. We will deal with  them. But  it does not have a trust fund, housing. This does have a trust fund, and what we  are  simply  doing  is  keeping  faith with  the  traveling  public,  who  agreed to  be  taxed  for  a  specific  purpose.  All increases come from spending the taxes and interest out of the trust fund. What  the  Committee  on  Appropriations  would  argue  here  is  that  they should  be  allowed  to  hoard  those  dollars  in  the  budget,  hold  the  trust  fund hostage,  in  order,  as  one  conferee  from the other body said in the course of our debate  in  the  conference,  so  we  could fund  Amtrak.  They  want  to  fund  Amtrak  out  of  the  surplus  they  want  to keep in the Aviation Trust Fund. That  does  not  keep  faith  with  the traveling public. We have taken care of Amtrak,  goodness  knows,  in  this  committee  and  in  the  Committee  on  Ways and  Means,  giving  them  $2.3  billion  in previously-earned  tax  benefits  from their predecessor railroads. What  this  legislation  does  in  fact with  respect  to  the  general  fund  is  cut in  half  the  general  fund  historic  contribution  to  aviation,  from  36  percent to 18 percent. All the rest is funded out of the trust fund. If  you  want  to  say  we  would  like  to hold  that  trust  fund,  we  would  like  to build  up  a  surplus  so  that  with  that surplus  we  can  fund  other  things,  then be honest with the public and say that. But  do  not  come  and  cry  crocodile tears about priorities that are supposed to  be  set  by  the  Committee  on  Budget and  by  the  Committee  on  Appropriations itself. ",

In  addition  to  being  awakened  at  all  hours  of  the  day  or  night,  but  they will have a hard  time getting much  sleep  in  the first place. Hardest  hit  will  be  those  people  who  live near  Chicago\u2019s  O\u2019Hare  Airport.  For  them,  the High  Density  Rule,  or  slot  rule  as  it  is  often called,  will  be  phased  out  by  July  1,  2002,  not January  1,  2007  as  is  the  case  for  La  Guardia and  JFK  Airports  in  New  York.  Or  to  put  it  another  way,  in  just  over  two  years,  there  will  no longer  be  any  set  limit  on  the  number  of  flights that  can  arrive  at,  or  depart  from, O\u2019Hare  even though  efforts  to  reduce  existing  noise  levels there  have  met  with  little  success.  When  that happens,  not  only  is  the  total  number  of  flights to  and  from  O\u2019Hare  likely  to  increase  dramatically\u2014but  so  too  will  airport  noise  levels  and the  risk  of  planes  colliding  either  on  the  runway  or  in  nearby  airspace.  That  two  airliners nearly  flew  into  one  another  over  Lake  Michigan  not  long  ago  should  alert  us  to  the  fact that  additions  to  O\u2019Hare\u2019s  very  busy  flight schedule  could  have  safety  as  well  as  noise implications. That  said,  Mr.  Speaker  and  colleagues, please  know  that  I  fully  understand  and  appreciate  why  you  may  want  to  make  it  easier  for your  constituents  to  visit  Chicago,  either  to  vacation  or  to  conduct  business. With  all  that  the city  has  to  offer\u2014the  Magnificent  Mile,  Navy Pier,  the  Museum  of  Science  and  Industry, Grant  Park,  the  Field  Museum,  Shedd  Aquarium  and  many  other  attractions  too  numerous to  mention\u2014it  is  no  wonder  that  people  from all  over  the  country want more  flights,  and  better  flights  schedules,  to  the  City  of  Broad Shoulders.  Make  no  mistake  about  it,  Chicago is  a  wonderful  place  to  visit  and  those  of  us fortunate  enough  to  live  in  or  near  the  city want  to  make  it  as  easy  as  possible  for  anyone  to  do  so. However,  that  can  be  readily  accomplished  without  making  it  almost  impossible  for  those  living  near  O\u2019Hare  to  get  a good  night\u2019s  sleep,  to  carry  on  a  quiet  conversation,  to  have  a  peaceful  cookout  in  their own  back  yard,  or  to  relax  in  the  knowledge that  aircraft  safety  is  not  being  put  to  an  additional  test. As  things  now  stand,  there  are  no  less  than four  other  regional  airports  within  100  miles  of Chicago.  One  of  these\u2014the  Greater  Rockford Airport\u2014already has a 10,000  foot  runway,  the second  longest  in  Illinois,  plus  an  8,200  foot runway  and  a  65,000  square  foot  passenger terminal  that  is  currently  underutilized.  Another\u2014Midway Airport on  the west  side of Chicago\u2014is  in  the  midst  of  a  terminal  expansion program  that  will  enable  it  to  serve  even  more air  passengers  than  it  does  already.  Since  the passenger  terminal  at  Greater  Rockford  could be  expanded  also,  there  is  no  compelling  reason  why  any  additional  flights  to  Chicago could  not  be  diverted  to  those  two  airports without  inconveniencing  air  passengers  to  any great  extent.  Both  lie  within  60  miles  of O\u2019Hare,  for  those  passengers  wishing  to  catch a  connecting  flight  and  neither  all  that  far,  or out of  reach,  from downtown Chicago. Given  the  existence  of  such  an  attractive and  relatively-easy-to  implement  alternative  to the  adverse  consequences  of  increasing flights  to  and  from  O\u2019Hare,  I  would  urge  my colleagues  to  vote  against  this  conference  report. Not  only would  its  defeat  today  enable  us to make  changes  that would accommodate  the demands  for  additional  air  service  to  Chicago by  directing  any  extra  flights  to  either  Midway Airport  or  Greater  Rockford  Airport,  but  it would  give  us  an  opportunity  to  make  several other  improvements as well. For  instance,  we  could\u2014and  should\u2014eliminate  the  50%  increase  in  the  PFC  that  is making  the airlines,  their passengers and  residents around  O\u2019Hare  Airport  understandably  nervous.  Also,  we  could\u2014and  should\u2014take  a  look and  see  whether  air  traffic  safety  and  aircraft noise  abatement  programs  are  being  sufficiently  funded  and,  if  not,  whether  funds should  be  transferred  from  other  projects  so that  people  living  near major  airports  can  have some  peace  and  quiet  as  well  as  peace  of mind.  They  deserve  every  bit  as  much  consideration  as  those who wish  to  see  additional  air service become a  reality. With  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  let  me  close  by once  again  urging my  colleagues  to  vote  down this  conference  report.  We  can,  and  should, make  it  responsive  not  just  to  the  needs  of  air travelers  but  to  the  very  legitimate  concerns  of those  living  near  our  Nation\u2019s  airports  as  well. Mrs. MORELLA. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in opposition  to  the  conference  report  for  the  Aviation Investment  and  Reform  Act  for  the  21st  Century. As  a  conferee  on  the  Research  and  Development  section  of  AIR\u201321,  I  applaud  the strong  bipartisan  support  for  the  significant  increase  in  funding  levels  for  the  FAA\u2019s  research,  engineering,  and  development  program.  It  is  remarkable  that  the  FY  2001  authorization  will  be  51%  more  than  the  current funding  levels  for  these  valuable activities. However,  some  sections  of  the  Aviation  Investment  and  Reform  Act  are  misguided  in their  purpose  and  detrimental  to  many  of  our constituents. If  the  conference  report  for  AIR\u201321  passes the  House  today,  twenty-four  new  slots  will  be added  to  Reagan  National  Airport.  Half  of these  additional  slots  will  be  used  for  flights outside  of  the  existing  perimeter  rule  of  1,250 miles. Drafters  of  this  legislation  claim  that  additional  slots  will  increase  airline  competition. What  they  do  not  realize  is  that  the  Washington  Metropolitan  Area  retains  an  enviably high  level  of  competitive  service.  Most  major cities  are  served  by  a  single  airport  with  a dominant  carrier.  Washington,  on  the  other hand,  is  fortunate  to  be  served  by  three  airports.  With  no  dominant  carrier,  changing  the slot  and  perimeter  rule  will  only  damage  the environmental  and  economic  balance  that  exists  between  National,  Dulles,  and  BWI  Airports.  An  increase  in  flights  at  National  could mean  fewer  flights  in  and  out  of  Dulles  and BWI\u2014which,  in  turn,  would  cause  further  flight delays. The  slot  rule  was  originally  part  of  a  \u2018\u2018good faith\u2019\u2019  agreement  between  federal,  local,  and airport  officials  when  control  of  National  and Dulles  was  transferred  from  the  FAA  to  a  local authority\u2014the  Metropolitan  Washington  Airports  Authority  (MWAA).  This  \u2018\u2018good  faith\u2019\u2019  provision  has  the  effect  of  abating  airport  and  air traffic  noise.  Any  tampering  with  the  current slot  rule will  open  the  doors  to  further  changes that  would  impact  the  airports\u2019  neighbors  in Maryland and Virginia. SHUSTER,  The  daily  lives  of  these  citizens  are  interrupted  enough  by  airplane  noise.  They  do  not need  additional  flights  disturbing  their  children at  school or  their  family dinners at home. More and  more,  scientific  studies  reveal  that  noise at  the  decibel  levels  found  in  communities neighboring  airports  may  cause  hearing  loss, impaired  health,  and  antisocial  behavior.  On the  floor  of  the  House,  I  have  often  stressed that  unlike  oil  spills  or  landfills,  noise  is  an  invisible  pollutant,  but  the  hazards  are  just  as real. The  Federal  Government  should  not  be  in the business of operating airports. The  citizens living  in  the  Washington  Metropolitan  area must  have  a  voice  in  the  ultimate  determination  of  decisions  that  affect  airport  and  air  traffic  noise.  They  are  the  ones  that  have  to  live each day with our decision. Mr.  MILLER  of  Florida.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise today  to  thank  the  conferees  for  including  a provision  in  this  bill  that  will  help  airports,  like the  Sarasota-Brandenton  International  Airport in  my  District,  use  certain  terminal  costs  to  be eligible  for  Passenger  Facility  Charge  funding. As  the  author  of  the  language,  I  also  wish  to clarify  that  the  intent  of  the  last  three  lines  of Section  152  (2)(c)  that  reads  \u2018\u2018between  calendar  year  1989  and  calendar  year  1997,\u2019\u2019 specifically  refers  to  calendar  years  1990 through  1996  and  does  not  include  calendar years 1989 and 1997. Mr.  BASS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  want  to  congratulate  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania,  Mr. once  again  for  developing  legislation that  returns  budgetary  honesty  to  our  trust funds,  ensuring  that  the  necessary  funding  for our nation\u2019s  transportation  infrastructure  is provided.  Similar  to  the  success  of  TEA\u201321  enacted  last  Congress,  this  bill,  Wendell  H.  Ford Aviation  Investment  and  Reform  Act  for  the 21st  Century  (AIR\u201321),  will  make  certain  that the  receipts  and  interest  of  the  Aviation  and Airways  Trust  Fund  are  used  to  improve  our aviation  infrastructure  first  and  the  administrations of operations  second. America\u2019s  transportation  system  is  the  envy of  the  world.  The  United  States,  however,  has pushed  our  air  transportation  system  to  the limit.  Aviation  delays  are  increasing  as  we  exceed  airport  and  runway  capacity.  The  United States  is  home  to  19  of  the  world\u2019s  20  busiest airports,  yet  we  do  not  have  the  world\u2019s  most advanced  air  traffic  control  systems.  AIR\u201321 will  provide  the  necessary  funding  for  airports to  keep  pace  with  the  dramatic  increase  in  air travelers. Nationwide,  passenger  travel  has  increased at  a  rate  of  five  percent  a  year,  and we  expect more  than  a  billion  people will  board  planes  by 2010. Manchester  Airport,  in my  home  state  of New  Hampshire,  is  the  fastest  growing  airport in  the  country.  In  1998,  1.94  million  people flew  out  of  Manchester,  which  represents  a 70%  increase over 1997. This  legislation  will  make  it  possible  to  increase  airport  capacity,  which  will  not  only  reduce  delays,  but  will  also  inject  a  healthy  shot of  competition  into  the  airline  industry.  By  creating  more  gates,  more  airlines  will  have  the opportunity  to  fly  popular  routes,  and  the  increased  competition  will  help  drive  down  ticket prices. Upgrading  antiquated  FAA  traffic  control systems  is  another  priority.  Just  last  year,  the FAA  experienced  more  than  100  significant system  outages  where  air  traffic  controllers lost  some  or  all  of  the  primary  systems  that ",

Small business  development  corporations have  been  at  their  funding  cap  since 1995. Clearly, this $3.1 million has had a significant  effect  on  small  business growth. This  is not  charity.  It  is  sound economic policy. It  is  time  we  stepped  up  our  support to  provide  greater  opportunities  for small business development and that  is why  I  stand  in  support  of  this  piece  of legislation. Mr. TALENT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Oklahoma (Mr. WATKINS). (Mr.  WATKINS  asked  and  was  given permission  to  revise  and  extend  his  remarks.) Mr.  WATKINS.  Mr.  Chairman,  I stand  in  strong  support  of  H.R.  3843.  I would  like  to  ask my  colleagues  to  envision with me a rural area of real economic  distress  since  the  Great  Depression.  One  of  the  major  characteristics of  such  an  area  is  high  unemployment, low  income,  and  also  the  lack  of  financing.  In  fact,  most  of  the  small banks only make some cattle loans and maybe  some  crop  loans  and  pickup truck  loans  to meet  existing  needs. We could  not  get  Oklahoma  City  or  Tulsa banks  to  come  down  to  this  rural  area. We  could  not  get  Fort  Worth  and  Dallas  banks  to  come  north  of  Red  River. It  was  a  no-man\u2019s  land  for  finance.  An area  in  economic  distress;  yes,  but  an economically  distressed  area  that  was waiting to be revitalized. My  years  of  public  service  have  been devoted  to  building  economic  opportunities  and  job  opportunities  for  our people.  I  have  worked  with  a  lot  of  industries,  and  I  have  found  without question  the  number  one  thing  they need  to  have  is  financing  to  help  expand businesses and industries. The  SBA  has  provided  a  vital  link  to be  able  to  provide  those  services through Section  7 and also  the  504  loan programs.  I  established  Rural  Enterprise,  Inc.,  in  my  district  in  order  to try  to  provide  some  kind  of  professional  expertise  and  needed  assistance working  with  and  packaging  SBA loans. I am very proud to report to this Congress  that  through  their  efforts  we have been able to finance over $150 million  worth  of  new  industry  in  those areas. SBA  has  offered,  along  with  working with  EDA,  and  I  know  the  gentleman from  Ohio  (Mr.  knows  I have  worked  with  him  on  EDA  and  we worked  on  all  kinds  of  financing  packages, SBA has been able to offer an  important  and  essential  financing  for many  people.  The  entrepreneurs,  and free  enterprise  individuals,  have worked to start and make their dreams come  true  and  offer  jobs  for  their  citizens.  That  is  \u00b4 truly  the  American  way. Ms.  VELA ZQUEZ.  Mr.  Chairman,  I yield  4  minutes  to  the  gentlewoman from  California  (Ms.  TRAFICANT)  MILLENDERMCDONALD). Ms.  MILLENDER-MCDONALD.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  thank  Mr. the chairman  and  the  ranking  member  for their outstanding work on this piece of legislation. Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  today  in  strong support  of  H.R.  3843,  the  Small  Business Reauthorization Act of 2000, which will  allow  us  to  reauthorize  the  Small Business  Administration  programs  for the next 3 years. As a member of this committee, I am pleased  to  note  that  with  the  passage of  this  authorization  bill,  we  continue the  committee\u2019s  work,  to  date  having passed  13  bills  and  the  President  signing eight of them. Furthermore,  this  is  the  first  reauthorization  that  is  a  straight  numbersonly  bill  since  the  1970s.  This  was  only made  possible  by  the  hard  work  that the  chairman  and  ranking member  and the  committee  did  to  deal  with  such issues as the women\u2019s business councils and  centers,  SBIC,  SBIR,  and  improving loan programs. This  authorization,  Mr.  Chairman, takes into account the changing face of small  business,  which  is  much  more global  and  are  now  at  96  percent  of  all exporters.  In  the  global  arena, we  have new  emerging  markets  and  these  new markets are prime opportunities for all the  small  businesses  to  become  a  part of this global marketplace. The  latest  statistics  reveal  that small  businesses  do  30  percent  of  the total  exporting  of  goods  from  this country.  Moreover,  the  funding  to  provide  programs  like  the  export  working capital  will  continue  to  assist  small businesses in competing globally. The  21st  century  has  revealed  the  increasing  diverse  nature  of  small  businesses. Minority-owned  firms are growing  at  a  rate  of  62  percent.  Womenowned  firms are growing at a rate of 43 percent. Through passage of SBA\u2019s loan programs,  we  have  and  will  continue  a trend  where  loans  to  African  Americans and Hispanics will double. While  SBA  needs  to  look  at  small business  failure  rates,  Mr.  Chairman, we  have  to  provide  the  necessary  business  infrastructure  and  technical  assistance  to  assure  the  viability  of  new small  businesses.  This  reauthorization provides  record  funding over  the next  3 years for core SBA loan programs. SBA\u2019s  flagship  program,  7  (A),  will make $1.3 billion more in loans and the Microloan  technical  assistance  program, which will more than double. Additionally,  SBIC  equity  investment program will make $3.3 million more in loans and, combined with the technical corrections  that were passed out yet  in another  bill,  this  program  is  ready  to finance more businesses in the future. Small  businesses  have  taken  off,  Mr. Chairman,  and  we  will  be  wise  to  join the  forces  to  ensure  its  growth  and prosperity. Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  be  remiss  if  I did not mention technology and its importance  to  small  businesses.  Studies show  that  small  businesses  are  the leading  force  of  innovation  and  that small  firms  produce  twice  as  many  innovations  per  employee  as  large  firms. This innovation has been made possible by technology. The  technology  provides  funding  for such incentives as SBDC, which we will offer  to  small  businesses;  and  they will have the opportunity to make the jump to  e-commerce  and  compete  in  the  increasingly  technology-driven  economy. The  passage  of  this  authorization,  Mr. Chairman,  will  assist  small  businesses in  obtaining  access  to  capital  that  is essential  and  important  for  the  growth and technical support needed to remain competitive. Moreover,  the  committee  will  have an  aggressive  agenda  to  work  toward passing  the  President\u2019s  new  market initiative,  which  is  aimed  at  helping low-  and  moderate-income  communities. Last  year\u2019s  New  Market  tour  highlighted  portions  of  my  district  of Watts,  and  I  am  here  to  say  that  it  is of great importance to me that we continue  our  efforts  to  help  low-  and moderate-income  communities.  That  is why  I  am  urging my  colleagues  to  support  H.R.  3843  and  continue  to  ensure that  the  Small  Business  Administration  prepare  itself  and  prepare  new small businesses for the growth and the opportunities that are needed. \u00b4 Ms.  VELA ZQUEZ.  Mr.  Chairman,  yield myself the balance of my time. Mr.  Chairman,  with  the  passage  of this legislation, we will be giving those with  vision  and  drive  a  chance  to  succeed.  As  discussed  earlier,  these  programs  have  helped  countless  individuals.  From  New  York  and  Massachusetts, across this country to California, urban  to  rural,  family-owned  businesses,  to  welfare  recipients,  SBA  programs have helped all of  them  succeed. This  has  been  made  possible  through access to over $11 billion in loans annually  and  their  flexible  approach  to counseling. I  would  like  to  commend  the  gentleman  from Missouri  (Mr. TALENT)  for his  fairness  and  hard  work  on  this  legislation. We  have  a  unique  opportunity to  prepare  our  Nation\u2019s  entrepreneurs for a new economy that  is more global, more  diverse,  and  increasingly  driven by technology. With  the  passage  of  this  reauthorization, we will  assist  in making  the kind of  economic  decisions  that  not  only will  help  close  the  widening  economic gap  in  this  country  but  will  hopefully keep  us  on  the  right  track  for  continued prosperity in the future. Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield  back  ance of my time. the  balI b 1400 Mr.  TALENT.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  close  by thanking  my  colleague,  the  gentlewoman  \u00b4 from  New  York  (Ms. It  has  been  a  pleasure working  with  her  on  this  and  other bills.  I appreciate her assistance.  I also want  to  thank  her  staffers,  Michael Day  and  Eric  Edwards,  and  my  own staff,  Harry  Katrichis,  Tee  Rowe,  Paul VELA ZQUEZ).  ",

And  our  constituents,  many  of  us  on  this  side,  including  mine  in  Georgia,  tell  us  that they  believe  in  strong  enforcement  of our  gun  laws,  that  they  believe  in  responsibility in schools and parents, and that  is  where  our  focus  ought  to  be. And  I  would  urge  the  gentlewoman  to join  us  in  keeping  the  focus  there,  not on  artificial  gun  control  or  on  outside groups. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to  the  gentleman  from  New York  (Mr.  a  new  member  of the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr.  WEINER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  have  a great  deal  of  respect  for my  colleagues on  the  other  side.  The  gentleman  from Arkansas  (Mr. HUTCHINSON) argued persuasively  that  there  are  some  very  difficult  issues  to  resolve  here.  And  I think  the  forum  to  resolve  these  issues is  in  a  conference  committee  where  I believe, and many of my  colleagues believe,  that  these  issues will  be  resolved favorably to our interest. But  I  think  that  we  have  to  be  careful  not  to  keep  repeating  things  that are  simply  incorrect  as  an  argument for not having the conference. The gentleman  from Georgia  repeats again and again  this  notion  that  is  perpetrated by  the  NRA  that  enforcement  is  down. Simply  not  true.  Unsubstantiated  by the  facts.  Twenty-five  percent  increase in  the  Federal  enforcement  in  the  last year;  a  7  percent  reduction  in  violent crime in the last year alone. And  the  final  proof  in  the  pudding,  if my  colleagues  do  not  want  to  compare it  just  year  to  year,  there  are  22  percent  more  people  in  prison  for  gun  offenses  today  than  there  were  in  1992. That is the fact of the matter. The National Rifle Association would like  to  repeat  and  repeat  and  repeat the  big  lie  that  these  laws  are  not being  enforced.  They  are  being  enforced  more  now  than  at  any  time  in the  last  decade.  So  my  colleagues  can have  many  reasons  to  oppose  the  conference  committee,  but  that  ought  not be one of them. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Michigan  (Mr.  the  ranking  member  of  the House Committee  on  the Judiciary,  and  someone who  has  spent  an enormous  amount  of  time  trying  to forge  an  answer  with  the  chairman  of the committee. Mr.  CONYERS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  want to  commend  the  gentlewoman  from California  (Ms.  for  the  great work  she  is  doing  in  bringing  this  motion  to  instruct,  because  this  is  the simplest  level  we  can  arrive  at.  I  have never  heard  of  a  motion  to  instruct that  had  no  substantive  purpose  whatsoever  except  to  ask  the  conferees  to meet.  This  must  be  a  record  of  some sort. And  this  is  an  absurd  and  morbid game  that  the  National  Rifle  Association is playing, to accuse the President of  being  dishonest  about  gun  safety legislation. Nobody wants  it more than CONYERS),  LOFGREN)  INSON)  him that the  President.  We  have  met  with  time  and  time  again.  We  know  that is true. The  tired  old  tactics  of  delaying  and distracting  cannot  hide  one  essential truth:  we  want  an  open  and  public  debate of these issues. The President says have a conference. Matter of fact, there are  more  conservatives  on  the  committee  than  there  are  liberals.  So  we will take whatever happens. But do not tell  the  American  people  that  for  8 months  we  are  not  going  to  do  anything whatsoever. The  NRA  fears  the  debate.  And  that fact alone speaks volumes. When an organization is scared to take this debate out  into  the  open,  who  is  really  lying? The  NRA  claimed  at  one  point  that they  pioneered  criminal  background checks.  Do  not  make  me  laugh.  I  was here.  They  fought  the  Brady  bill  tooth and  nail.  So  who  is  really  lying?  They say  they  support  gun  show  and  background checks, but they offer bills that would  exclude  events  where  hundreds of  guns  are  sold  from  any  background checks. And  by  the  way,  the  biggest  gun shows  in  America  are  in  California, where  they  check  very  carefully  the purchases  that  are  done  there.  So  we beg  our  colleagues  to  support  the  motion to instruct. Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire on the balance of time? The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr.  Speaker,  I yield  2 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. TRAFICANT). Mr.  TRAFICANT.  Mr.  Speaker,  I voted  for  Brady,  I  voted  to  ban semiautomatics,  and  I  am  done  voting. I  think  it  is  time  to  start  enforcing the laws. And I think it is time to start looking at political  issues around here. I  think we  are  playing  a  lot  of  football with guns. On  that  juvenile crime bill  I passed a little  amendment  that  said,  look,  a teenager  or  kid  that  is  involved with  a gun  that  gets  caught  loses  their  driving  privileges  until  they  are  21.  Where are we enforcing this law? Not this one, I hope, that becomes law. Where is the aggressive record of this administration  and  even  the  past  administration  going  after  people  that violate  laws  with  the  use  of  guns?  I think  we  are  throwing  an  awful  lot  on the NRA  that  need  not  be  on  the NRA. My God, when kids are building a bomb in  the  basement  of  a  home,  where  is mom  and  dad?  It  is  not  the  NRA\u2019s fault. I  do  not  want  anybody\u2019s  guns  taken away.  And  I  am  telling  the  Democrats this: with  the  language that  the Democrats  have  for  these  gun  shows,  there will  be more  illegal  sales  at  gun  shows than  there  will  be  legal  sales  if  it  was just left alone. I do not want to argue the case, I say to  the  gentleman  from  Michigan  (Mr. HUTCHCONYERS). to  the the  genSpeaker, will  Mr.  CONYERS. Mr.  gentleman yield? Mr.  TRAFICANT.  I  yield  tleman from Michigan. Mr.  CONYERS. Mr.  Speaker,  I  say  to the  gentleman  from  Ohio  that,  as  the one  who  made  that  amendment,  I would  like him to know that we have a modification  of  Lautenberg  which  allows  24-hour,  1-day,  clearance  for  gun checks. And  then  for  the  5 percent who cannot check  in the 1-day, we have a 2day  period.  Now  does  that  take  away anybody\u2019s rights? b CONYERS),  1515 Mr.  TRAFICANT.  Mr.  Speaker,  reclaiming  my  time,  what  if  it  was  a  2day  sale,  I  say  to  the  gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr.  and  it  is  a Saturday  at  4  o\u2019clock  and  that  gun dealer  wants  to  make  a  buck  and  just sells the gun anyway to Joe Blow. Mr.  Speaker,  there  are  two  sides  of this  issue,  be  careful,  but  the  Clinton administration could be much more aggressive  on  crime  and  guns  and  that  is the fact of it. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to  the  gentlewoman  from  Illinois  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), a distinguished member of the committee. Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Mr.  Speaker,  I know  I  am  not  alone  in  asking  how long  we  have  to  wait  and  what  is  it going to take? It  is  hard  to  believe  that  it  is  almost 1  year  since  the  Columbine  tragedy, and  yet  it  appears  that  we  have  not learned  a  thing.  Since  Columbine,  we have  endured  tragedies  in  Conyers, Georgia;  my  community  of  Rogers Park in Chicago, Illinois; Bloomington, Indiana;  Atlanta,  Georgia;  Pelham, Alabama; Granada Hills, California; Ft. Worth,  Texas;  Honolulu,  Hawaii;  Seattle,  Washington;  Wilkinsburg,  Pennsylvania;  Memphis,  Tennessee;  Kayla Rollard  in  Mt.  Morris  Township  in Michigan.  Thirteen  children,  a  Columbine\u2019s  worth  of  children,  every  day are killed in the United States. Communities  are  waiting.  Parents are waiting. But most importantly, our children  are  waiting.  Why  can  we  not at  least  sit  down  and  have  this  conference committee? I  rise  to  support  this  motion  to  instruct,  and  I  urge  my  colleagues  on both  sides  of  the  aisle  to  get  to  business.  The  American  people  are  watching and they are waiting. Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to  the  gentlewoman  from  Ohio (Mrs. JONES). (Mrs.  JONES  of  Ohio  asked  and  was given  permission  to  revise  and  extend her remarks.) Mrs.  JONES  of  Ohio.  Mr.  Speaker, every  day  children,  young  people, adults  and  seniors  come  to  these  hallowed  halls  to  look  to  Congress  for leadership,  to  set  the  example,  to  show democracy  in action,  to have a  real debate and discussion on  juvenile  justice, gun control, and gun safety.

Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask unanimous  consent  to  take  the  time  of the gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. LIPINORDER SKI). The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Is  there objection  to  the  request  of  the  gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. f THE  DOGGETT)  IMPORTANCE  OF  ADDRESSING THE  ISSUE  OF  H1B  VISAS The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Under  a previous  order  of  the  House,  the  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker,  I  joined a  number  of  colleagues  this  morning, some  of  whom  will  be  speaking  here this afternoon, about the importance of addressing the issue of H1B visas. As  I  visit  with  local  business  leaders in central Texas,  I know  that  the number  one  high  technology  issue  in  our community,  and  I  think  across  this country,  is  work  force  development, the  fact  that  we  could  have  and  do have  already  some  serious  shortages  of skilled workers that can slow down the expansion that has fueled our economic growth throughout the country. From  offices  regularly  assisting  our local  high-tech  companies  in  securing H1B  visas,  I  also  know  that  this  is  one of  the answers  that can assist us  in addressing this worker shortage. One of the reasons that central Texas prospers  is  that  we  live  the  lyrics  of  a great Lyle Lovett song: Oh, no, you are not  from  Texas,  but  Texas  wants  you anyway. And it is because we have been able  to  reach  out  and  bring  the  best and  brightest,  not  only  from  all  over the  country  but  from  all  over  the world,  that  we  have  been  able  to  keep our high-tech economy booming. I support this bipartisan effort  to get increases  in  the  number  of  visas  for highly-skilled high-tech workers  to  address  this  problem  of  worker  shortage. It  is  a  stopgap  measure,  however.  We are  only  at  March  and  we  are  already running  out  of  the  H1B  visas.  We  need to  solve  the  problem  for  our  high-tech companies  now,  but  we  need  to  realize that this is not a permanent solution. That  is  why  this  legislation  also  increases  the  fees  for getting  these visas, and  then  will  plow  that  money  back into  developing  our  domestic  work force  and  helping  our  teachers  and  our young  people  pursue  careers  in  technology. I  believe  that  it  is  important  also that  we  not  only  focus  on  the  amount or  the  number  of  visas,  or  the  amount of  the  money  that  will  be  charged  to get  them,  but  on  the  entire  system that  the  Immigration  Service  and  the Department  of  Labor  use  in  addressing this issue. I  find  it  a  system  that  is  so  plagued with  bureaucracy  that  it  is  almost  a daily  problem  for  my  office  in  Austin, as well as for the many companies with whom we work. It is time that that bureaucracy move  into  the electronic age in  which  our  businesses  operate  at present. b 1630 So  a  principal  focus  of  this  bill  is  to see  that  the  Immigration  Service  and the  Department  of  Labor  recognize that  many  people  search  for  jobs  now over  the  Internet  and  recognize  those postings  to  fulfill  the  statutory  requirements, and that we move to a system  where  one  can  file  for  an  application  on-line,  where  one  can  track  an application  on-line,  and  we  reduce  the level  of  bureaucracy  in  this  entire process. I am pleased to join in this bipartisan effort.  I  believe  that  it will  be  successful.  There  is  already  some  legislation moving in the Senate. The White House has  recently  announced  an  interest  in this  topic.  With  good  bipartisan  support  here,  there  is  no  reason  that  we should  not  be  able  to  act  and  fulfill this very definite need  in the very near future. f BURTON)  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. SHIMKUS).

But  that  is only part of  the  solution  to that problem. The  bill  we  introduced  this  morning that  the  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr. referenced  has  a  package  of ideas  that  I  think  will  help  deal  with the  larger  issue, which  is basically  filling  the  high-tech  jobs  that  we  have  a crushing need for in this country. If  we  talk  to  any  tech  business,  they will  tell  us  their  number  one  biggest concern  is  finding  the  people  to  do  the work  that  they  have  to  be  done.  We have  to  understand  that  the  technology  sector  of  our  technology  is  the faster  growing  sector  out  there.  It  is generating  jobs  and  generating  a strong  economy.  If we  can  find  the  scientists and the engineers and the biologists  to  fill  these  jobs,  we  could  grow our  economy  even more  and  secure  our economic future. We need the people to fill these jobs. The H\u20131B visa bill that we introduced this  morning  attacks  this  in  two  difSMITH)  ROEMER),  DOGGETT),  ferent  directions.  One,  we  go  out  and try  to  attract  the  best  and  the  brightest  from around  the world. That  is  just common sense. Why would not we want the  best,  brightest,  and  most  capable minds  in  the  world  here  in  the  U.S., growing  our  economy  and  generating jobs  for  us.  We  need  to  expand  those numbers and bring those folks in. But we also increase the fee for those H\u20131B visas and will, therefore, generate $200 million  in money  to  invest  in  educating  our  own  population  to  fill  those jobs  as  well.  Because  this  is  a  longterm  problem.  Bringing  in  people  from other  countries  is  a  short-term  solution. We heed to educate our own workforce so that they want to be scientists and  engineers  and  have  access  to  those jobs  so  they  start  filling  them  as  well. This  is  absolutely  critical  to  the  future of our economy.  I  think we  should support  this  bill  in  the  House  and  in the Senate and hopefully move  forward with our economic situation so that we can  fill  those  jobs  that  need  to  be filled. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. DOOLEY). Mr.  DOOLEY  of  California.  Mr. Speaker,  I  am  delighted  to  be  joining the  gentleman  from  Washington  (Mr. and  the  gentleman  from  Virginia  (Mr. MORAN), the gentleman  from Indiana  (Mr.  the  gentleman from  Texas  (Mr.  the  gentlewoman  from  California  (Ms.  and  a  number  of  other  Members  in  the new  Democrat  coalition  that  are  advancing a policy we  think  is very, very important,  to  allow  the  United  States to  maintain  its  relative  advantage  in terms of clearly being the leader in the world in technology. This  is  absolutely  critical  for  the United  States,  because  when  one  looks at  that  technology  sector,  it  is  an  area where  we  have  created  more  jobs, where  we  have  created  more  wealth, where  we  are  creating more  opportunities for our families. What  the  H\u20131B  legislation  that  we are  introducing  today  is,  in  many ways,  is  going  to  ensure  that  the United  States  has  the  top  200,000  draft choices, the top 200,000 draft choices for the  brightest,  the most  intelligent,  the most  capable  engineers  throughout  the world. We should feel fortunate as a country that  these  bright  minds  are  interested in coming and  investing their time and energy  in  creating  jobs,  in  creating  opportunities  which  are  so  important  to the  longer  term  future  of  this  country. We have also have made  the  commitment to ensure that we are investing in education  and  job  training  programs, which  are  going  to  ensure  that  we  are developing  the  domestic  talent  that can eventually fill these positions. We  have  come  forth  with  a  balanced approach,  one  which  will  continue  to ensure  that  the  United  States  is  providing the  leadership  in the technology sector  and  also  a  commitment  to  provide up to $200 million, in education for ESHOO) ",

Minorities will be underrepresented. They will not be  counted.  They  will  not  exist  for  the purposes  of  making  sure  that  they  are represented when they draw those lines in the State legislatures. We  cannot  start  a  new  millennium with  inaccurate  numbers.  This  is  not 1990.  We  have  the  ability;  we  have  the science;  we  have  the  method;  and  it  is there  at  our  disposal,  only  if we  use  it. Think  of  it,  a  new  millennium;  and we  start  it  off  with  an  inaccurate  census  that  does  not  count  everyone,  and for  10  years  going  into  the  next  century,  we  live  with  these  inaccurate numbers, at great cost to the quality of life  of  our  fellow  Americans.  That  will not  be  tolerated,  that  should  not  be tolerated,  and  that  is  why  I  come  here tonight  to  join my  colleague  from New York  in  a  single  voice  to  say  that  we are  here  to  remind  the  American  public, whether they be Republican, Democrat  or  Independents,  that  we  must join  together  and  use  the  best  method to  have  an  accurate  census,  because  it truly impacts all of us. The  old  quote,  \u2018\u2018For  whom  does  the bell toll,\u2019\u2019 well,  it tolls  for you and me, because  we  are  all  Americans  in  this great  country.  If  one  American  goes without a voice, then all Americans are without  a  voice.  This  is  not  what  this great  country  has  been  built  on  all these  years.  This  is  not  what  we  have fought  great  wars  over.  This  is  a  representational  democracy,  and  we  can never achieve that if we do not have an accurate census and if we do not utilize proven scientific methods, such as sampling. So  I  beseech  and  implore  everyone out  there  that has  any  questions  about it,  they  can  come  and  talk  to  us.  We will  be  happy  to  have  a  dialogue.  But let  us  not  let  this  be  reduced  to  some petty  partisan  squabble,  where  the only  end  game  and  end  product  will  be some  sort  of  perceived  political  advantage.  There  is  much  more  at  stake here. GENERAL LEAVE Mrs.  MALONEY  of  New  York.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask unanimous consent that all  Members  may  have  5  legislative days within which  to  revise and  extend their remarks on this special order. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Is  there objection  to  the  request  of  the  gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Mrs.  MALONEY  of  New  York.  Mr. Speaker,  I yield  to  the gentleman  from Illinois  (Mr.  DAVIS),  a  member  of  the Census  Subcommittee,  who  has  been our most consistent advocate for an accurate  count  and  a  strong  voice  for civil  rights  and  social  justice  and  all scientific  methods  to  correct  the undercount. MALONEY),  I  thank  the  gentleman  for  all  of  his hard work and  leadership this year. We all appreciate it. (Mr. DAVIS  of  Illinois  asked  and was given  permission  to  revise  and  extend his remarks.) Mr. DAVIS  of  Illinois. Mr. Speaker,  I certainly  want,  first  of  all,  to  thank the  gentlewoman  from New York  (Mrs. who  has  done  such  an  outstanding  job  of  providing  leadership  on this  issue  over  the  past  2  years  and more.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  gentlewoman  has  been  all  across  the  country looking  at  different  approaches,  methods,  techniques,  talking  to  as  many people  as  she  possibly  could,  trying  to get  the message  out;  and  I  think  all  of America  owes  the  gentlewoman  a  tremendous  debt  of  gratitude  for  her  unselfish  efforts  in  trying  to  make  sure that  we  do  in  fact  have  an  accurate count.  I  certainly  want  to  thank  the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, an accurate census is in the best interests of our Nation. In less than  22  days  the  Census  Bureau  will undertake  the  enormous  task of  counting the entire population. It  is an exercise that has been done since 1790 when the first census was commissioned. Unfortunately,  during  the  first  census,  not  everyone  was  counted.  As  a matter  of  fact,  Africans  in  America were  considered  three-fifths  of  a  person.  Since  1790,  we  have  evolved  as  a Nation  to  include  at  least  on  paper women and minorities as equal citizens of this democracy. However,  the  proposed  methods  of counting  the  population  by  many  in the  Republican  Party,  including  its most  likely  presidential  nominee, Governor George Bush, could lead to a serious  undercount  of  our  citizens.  This  is tantamount  to  moving  backwards  instead of going forward. The  constituents  of  my  district,  the Seventh  District  of  Illinois,  deserve and  demand  an  accurate  count  of  the entire  population.  They  realize,  as many  others  do,  that  too  much  is  at stake  to  get  less  than  an  accurate count. In  1990,  for  example,  we  lost millions of  dollars  in  Chicago  in  Federal  funds because  of  a  census  undercount.  According  to  the  Census  Bureau,  at  least 10 million people, at  least 113,831  in the State of Illinois, 81,000 in Cook County, and  68,000  in  the  City  of  Chicago,  were not counted in the 1990 census. Many of those missed  were  children  and  women who live in minority communities, people  who  are  in  need  of  Federal  programs  to assist  them  in  their daily  living. Because  the  1990  census  miscounted thousands  of  people  in  Chicago,  every one  of  our  residents were  shortchanged on  money  to  repair  roads  and  streets. They  were  shortchanged  on  money  for mass  transit  and  senior  citizen  programs.  They  were  shortchanged  on money for schools, parks and job training. Perhaps  the  most  egregious  shortchange  was  that  of  political  representation.  In  a  democracy,  representation is  essential  to  having  a  voice  in  local, State  and  Federal  Government,  and when those in powerful positions fail to do  what  is  right,  America  loses.  It  is unfortunate  that  the  census  has  become  so  political  that  those  in  power would ignore the voices of the National Academy  of  Sciences  and  others  who have  said  that  strict  enumeration could  result  in  millions  more  people being missed by the census. I often  say  that when  elephants  rumble,  it  is  the  ground  that  gets  trampled.  In  this  case,  it  is  the  rights  of those  in  rural  and  urban  America,  the rights  of  the  poor,  the  rights  of  the needy, who will  be  abridged  if  they  are not counted. Perhaps  Lincoln  said  it  best  when  he said  that you  can  fool  some  of  the  people  some  of  the  time,  but  you  cannot fool all of the people all of the time. So  I  am  pleased  to  join  with  my  colleagues  in  urging  that  those  in  powerful  positions  to  lead  do  so,  and  not  follow what many  predict  is  a  flawed way of counting our citizens. The essence of leadership  requires  that  one  do what  is right and not politically expedient. This  is  a  great  opportunity  for  Governor  Bush  to  show  that  he  is  concerned  about  women,  children  and  minorities  in  urban  and  rural  communities.  I  urge  him  to  reconsider  his  position  on  the  census  question  and  do the  right  thing,  to  make  sure  that every  citizen  is  counted,  because,  if you  are not  counted,  then  truly you  do not count. Mr.  Speaker,  I  want  to  urge  all  citizens  of  this  country,  and  especially residents  of  the  State  of  Illinois,  to make sure that when you get the  form, that  you  too  do  the  right  thing:  Fill  it out, complete it, send it in. Again I say to the gentlewoman  from New  York  (Mrs.  I  commend her for being a stalwart, a true trooper, a  real  soldier,  as  one might  say,  of  the cause,  carrying  the  message  throughout  all  America  that  if  you  are  not counted, then you truly do not count. I tell the gentlewoman, she counts in the hearts  of  millions  of  Americans  who know the great work that she has done, and we all appreciate it. Mrs.  MALONEY  of  New  York.  Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the  gentleman  very, very  much  for  those  kind  statements and his professional statements. Mr.  Speaker,  our  next  speaker  is  the gentleman  from  New  Jersey  (Mr. the  Vice  Chair  of  the Democratic  Caucus,  who  has  been  a leader  on  this  issue  and  many  other issues  that  are  important  to  our  country.  I  thank  the  gentleman  for  coming tonight. (Mr.  MENENDEZ  given  permission  to  his remarks.) Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, let me thank  the  gentlewoman  for  organizing this special order this evening to speak to  one  of  the  most  important  peacetime  activities  that  take  place  in  our country,  which  is  the  census,  and  for asked  and  was revise  and  extend MALONEY),  MENENDEZ),  ",

The  IDEA  program is our highest priority  in the education budget this year. But  I want  to keep  it  all  in  the  proper  context,  again  going  back  to  the budget  track  record  since  the  American people threw the Democrats out of the  Speaker\u2019s  chair,  out  of  the  majority, and put  the Republicans  in  charge. We  have  dramatically  dropped  the amount of deficit spending in the country.  What  we  are  talking  about  today are the fruits of prioritization. For too long in this town, Democrats, when  put  in  charge  of  our  national budget,  talked  about  spending,  but only  spending. They did not  talk about prioritization,  picking  those  programs that  truly  make  sense,  that  are  truly in  the best  interest of  the country, and getting  rid  of  lesser  priorities  that, frankly,  we  have  gotten  rid  of.  And most  Americans  have  not  noticed  that they  are  gone.  That  is  the  way  we  are able  now  to  show  and  to  establish  for the House  and  for  the American  people that a Republican majority in Congress has  delivered  a  balanced  budget  fully  4 years ahead of schedule. We  have  eliminated  these  deficit spending blocks that my colleagues see here  in  red.  We  have  ended  this  business  of  borrowing  money  from  the  Social  Security  Administration  in  order to  pay  for  the  rest  of  government, which is represented in the blue blocks, and  now  we  are  to  the  point  where  we are  actually  spending  fewer  dollars  in Washington  than  the  American  people send  us,  which  allows  us  to  establish priorities,  to  make  priorities  for  the American  people,  which  the  gentlewoman from New Mexico just described with respect to education. We  have  other  priorities,  too.  Not only  do we want  to  elevate  the  stature of  those  priority  programs  that  make sense  for  America\u2019s  schoolchildren  and for  the  defense  of  our  country  and  for seniors and so on, we also want to send a  certain  amount  of  that  money  back home  to  the  people  who  work  hard  to earn  it, and we want  to work harder  to pay the debt down quicker. And we can do all these things by just being smarter in Washington. That is what the American people believed  we  would  do  when  they  gave  us the majority. They understood that the Democrats were incapable of building a responsible  budget.  They  threw  them out. They took the gavel out of a Democrat  Speaker\u2019s  hand  and  put  it  into  a Republican  Speaker\u2019s  hand;  and we  are here  now,  in  2000,  getting  ready  to bring  a  2001  budget  to  the  floor  which keeps  us  on  track  for more  responsible spending. I  know  the  gentleman  from  South Dakota  is  one  who  has  been  instrumental  in  helping  us  fight  the  hard fights  of  bringing  responsible  budgets to  this  Congress  and  helping  to  make the  priorities  not  just  to  spend  more money  but  to  spend  money  on  things that really and truly do matter and are who  TANCREDO)  in  the  category  of  legitimate  functions of  our  government  at  the  expense  of waste, fraud and abuse. I yield the floor to him. Mr.  THUNE.  I  thank  the  gentleman from  Colorado  for  yielding,  and  would echo  much  of  what  he  said,  and  the gentlewoman  from New Mexico, who so very  eloquently  made  the  case  for  the investment  that  we  have  made  in  education,  as  well  as  the  gentleman  from Arizona  and  the  gentleman  from  Colorado  (Mr.  here  on  the  floor this  evening,  all  share  the  same commitment. I  think  that  when  we  get  right  down to  it  on  a  very  basic  level,  a  budget  is a  statement  of  priorities.  The  budget resolution  that  will  be  adopted  in  the House, and I will admit I have not read the  fine  print  at  this  point,  but  from all I have been able to gather about the work  that  the Committee on  the Budget  has  under way,  this  is  a  budget  that will  be  a  reflection  of  the  priorities that we have for this country. Now, the people of South Dakota, the hard  working  people  in  my  State,  day in  and  day  out,  month  in  and  month out,  year  in  and  year  out  have  to  go about  balancing  their  budget.  They  do not  have  the  luxury  the  Federal  Government  has  had  for  so  many  years  of going  so  far  in  the  red  and mortgaging their  children\u2019s  future.  That  is  what has happened here in Washington. So  I  think  to  suggest  that we  can,  in a  very  straightforward  way,  make  better  use  of  the  dollars  that  are  at  the disposal of the Washington government here  and  achieve  the  savings  that  are necessary so that people can keep more of what  they  earn  and  that we  can  distribute  that  power  out  of  Washington and  back  home,  I  think  is  a  very  real commitment  on  the  part  of  the Republican Congress. Now,  I will  say  that  if we  look at  the statement  of  priorities  that  was  evident  in  the  President\u2019s  budget,  it  was, is,  and  always  will  be  the  extension  of the reach of big government and higher taxes.  Make  no  mistake  about  it,  that is  exactly  what  was  in  the  President\u2019s budget this year; and it has been in the President\u2019s  budget  every  year  since  I have  been  here.  And  the  gentleman from Arizona who was  here  in  the Congress  prior  to  our  arrival  here  knows that  we  have  made  hard  decisions about  trying  to  come  up  with  ways  to achieve  additional  savings,  come  up with  a  budget  that  makes  sense,  that finds  the waste,  fraud  and  abuse  in  the Federal Government and roots it out so that  we  are  being  responsible  to  the people  of  this  country  who,  again,  day in  and  day  out  have  to  go  about  the process  of  coming  up  with  a  budget that  makes  sense  for  them  and  their families. I  just  want  to  add  that  as  I  look  at this  budget  resolution  that  we  are  in the  process  of  considering  this  year. And  look  at  the  statement  of  priorities,  it  is  a  reflection  of  the  things that we believe in profoundly. First off, I  also  have  to  note  that  if  we  look  at HAYWORTH)  the  accomplishments  of  the  past  5 years,  which  the  gentleman  from  Colorado  noted,  where  we  have  come  from, the budgetary priorities that have been established  in  the  last  several  Congresses since we took control of this institution,  have  allowed  us  to,  for  the first  time  since  I  was  8  years  old,  in 1969,  balance  the  Federal  budget.  Even more  importantly  than  that,  last  year, balance  the  Federal  budget  without raiding  Social  Security.  That  is  a  remarkable accomplishment. And  that  is  coupled  with  the  first time  in  a  great many  years  of  actually retiring  a  portion  of  the  3.6  publicly held  Federal  debt.  The  last  couple  of years we have  paid  down  $140  billion  in debt.  They  said  we  could  not  do  that. They  said  we  could  not  reduce  taxes. We  reduced taxes  in  1997, which has  led to additional revenues. This program is working for the American people. This year, this budget is a further reflection  of  those  same  priorities  because  they make  essential  investments in  areas  like  the  gentlewoman  from New  Mexico  mentioned,  and  that  is education.  A  program  that  is  near  and dear  to  my  heart  and  the  gentleman from  Arizona  (Mr.  is  impact aid, because we have a lot of federally impacted lands. Special  Ed.  The  Federal  Government made  a  commitment  that  it  has  not fulfilled, not honored. We have a promise  to  the  American  people  and  the school districts in this country that we need  to  live  up  to,  and  we  move  down the  path  farther  this  year  toward  honoring that commitment. The  commitment  to  our  seniors  to protect  Social  Security  and  Medicare, to  ensure  that  the  programs  that  they rely upon  in  their  retirement years are going  to  be  there.  We  are,  for  the  first time,  walling  off  that  money  and  saying  we  are  not  going  to  spend  the  Social Security  surplus. That  is  a  significant  and  radical  departure  from  what has  been  happening  in  the  past  several years here in the Congress. Commitment  to  our  veterans.  Last year we increased spending on veterans health  care  by  about  $1.7  billion.  This year,  again,  this  budget  resolution will recognize  the  commitment  that  we have  to  those  who  have  served  this country  honorably  and  nobly.  We  need to  ensure  that  we  honor  the  promise that  we  made  to  them  in  the  area  of health care. This is a budget which will increase  funding  for  veterans  health care substantially. Farmers.  My  State  of  South  Dakota, farmers  and  small  business  people, farmers  and  ranchers,  people  working the  land  and  trying  to  make  a  living and  have  had  to  deal  with  the  tremendous  terrible  cycle  of  low  prices,  bad weather,  and  everything  else  associated  with  it,  this  budget  puts  aside about  $8  billion  for  crop  insurance  reform.  That  is  the  risk-management tool  that  producers  can  use  to  help manage  the  risk  and  manage,  as  best they  can,  to  try  to  avert  the  devastating  effect  of  weather  disasters that are so frequent.

But  India\u2019s  decisions also  have  consequences  beyond  South  Asia. Here,  prudence  and  clarity  in  India\u2019s  plans and  doctrines  could  yield  great  benefits.  For a pattern of steeply rising defense budgets in Asia  would  serve  neither  the  continent\u2019s  security  interests  nor  its  development  needs. Such  principles  of  restraint  are  consistent with  statements  India\u2019s  own  leaders  have made. How India addresses all these issues will, of course,  influence the decisions we make. But our  goal  is  a  qualitatively  different  and  better  relationship  with  India\u2014not  a  simple  return to the status quo before the tests. Our  ability  to  attain  this  goal  will  depend largely on what India does. And the limits on our  ability  to  cooperate  with  India  are  a matter  of  US  law,  as  well  as  our  international  obligations.  And  our  approach  to nonproliferation  is  global.  We  cannot  abandon  it  simply  because we  desire  an  improved relationship.  Any  other  stance  would  break faith  with  all  the  nations\u2014from  South  Africa to South America to the former Soviet republics\u2014who  decisions  to  strengthen  their own  security  and  the  cause  of  nonproliferation  by  joining  the  NPT.  And  it  would  give cover  to  states  which,  unlike  India,  might threaten us directly. We  will  persist  in  our  efforts  to  reconcile, to  the  greatest  extent  possible,  our  nonproliferation  concerns  with  India\u2019s  appreciation  of  its  security  requirements.  Our  dialogue  on  these  subjects  will  be  continued during the President\u2019s trip, and beyond. One topic we will discuss  in both  India and Pakistan  is  the  relationship  between  these two  countries.  Let  me  say  a  word  about  the President\u2019s  decision  to  stop  in  Pakistan  at the  end  of  our  trip.  And  on  one  key  issue,  I want  to  leave  no  room  for  doubt.  In  no  way is  this  a  decision  to  endorse  the  military coup  or  government  led  by  General Musharraf. And no one  should  interpret  it as such. We  are  going  to  Pakistan  because  the United  States  has  interests  there  which  are important\u2014and urgent. Our interests include avoiding the threat of conflict in South Asia; fostering  democracy  in  Pakistan;  fighting terrorism;  preventing  proliferation;  and doing what we can to help create an environment  of  regional  peace  and  security;  and reaching out to a people whose history is one of friendship with the United States. The  President  is  not  going  to  Pakistan  to mediate  the Kashmir  dispute. We  have made it  clear  he will  not  do  that  unless  both  sides ask. Last  4th  of  July,  the President\u2019s  ability  to engage  directly  with  the  Pakistani  Government  played  a  key  role  in  defusing  a  tense conflict  in  Kargil.  For  the  President  to maintain  such  lines  of  communication  may be very important in any future crisis. Some  of  you  know  that,  when  I  was  a young  girl,  my  father  worked  as  a  diplomat at  the  UN  on  the  problem  of  Kashmir.  He wrote  a  book  whose  first  chapter  contains the simple but eloquent statement, \u2018\u2018The history  of  Kashmir  is  a  sad  story.\u2019\u2019  He  is  now dead,  and  I  am  old,  and  yet  still  this  tragic story goes on. But  today,  the  conflict  over  Kashmir  has been  fundamentally  transformed.  For  nations must not attempt  to  change borders or zones  of  occupation  through  armed  force. And now that they have exploded nuclear devices,  India  and  Pakistan  have  all  the  more reason  to  avoid  an  armed  conflict,  and  all the  more  reason  to  restart  a  discussion  on ways  to  build  confidence  and  prevent  escalation. India  and  Pakistan  today  must  find  some way  to move  forward. The  process  is not  one that  the  international  community  can  prescribe  for  them.  We  only  know  that  it  will the  of  solnot  courage  courage\u2014but  take  diers. And  we  can  be  sure  of  one  more  practical reality:  Tangible  steps  must  be  taken  to  respect the Line of Control. For so long as this simple  principle  is  violated,  the  people  of Kashmir have no real hope of peace. Another  vital  US  interest  in  Pakistan  is countering  terrorism.  The  terrorist  camps next  door  in  Afghanistan  directly  threaten American  lives.  Because  of  Pakistan\u2019s  influence  with  its  neighbor,  this  matter  will  be high on the President\u2019s agenda. General Musharraf  has  offered  to  go  to Afghanistan  himself  to  discuss  concerns  about terrorism.  We  hope  to  hear  more  from  him about  this.  And  we  want  to  see  steps  to  address  the  effects  of  terror  on  Pakistan\u2019s neighbors, notably India. Nothing  would  do  more  to  bolster  the  entire world\u2019s  confidence  in Pakistan\u2019s  government  than  to  learn  that  its  people  will  regain  their  ability  to  choose  their  leaders sooner  rather  than  later.  And  few  things  did more  to  undermine  the  confidence  than  the recent order that  judges take an oath of  loyalty  to  the military,  rather  than  to  the  constitution. In all these areas and others, we see opportunities  not  for  mere  gestures,  but  for  real steps  forward.  For  example,  Pakistan\u2019s  foreign minister has recently argued the advantages,  from  Pakistan\u2019s  own  standpoint,  of early  signature  of  the  CTBT.  Now,  that would  be  the  kind  of  coup  for  Pakistan\u2014and I  guarantee,  the  international  community would rally around it. President Clinton will go to India, and also to  Bangladesh  and  Pakistan,  to  strengthen America\u2019s  bonds  with  a  region  that  is  growing  in  importance  with  each  passing  year. And  in  so  doing, he will  affirm  on  an  official level  what  many  in  this  room  can  testify  to in their own lives. For  the  connections  between  America  and South  Asia  are  manifest.  They  may  come  in the  form  of  a  physician  from  Mumbai  who spends part of her  time  each year  in Los Angeles;  or  a  businessman  in Boston who  is  developing  a  new  technology  with  a  firm  in Dhaka;  or  a  teacher  from  Tennessee  who  is working with young people in Islamabad. In  today\u2019s  world,  geography  is  no  longer destiny. America and South Asia are distant, but  we  are  linked  in  the  opportunities  we have, the threats we face, and the changes to which we must respond. President Clinton\u2019s historic visit offers the prospect of a welcome new chapter  in our relations with  India and her neighbors. But although  that  chapter  may  begin  with  a  visit from  the  White  House,  it  will  be  written  by the people of all our countries. For  the  President\u2019s  visit,  I  ask  your  support  next  week.  For  the  larger  task,  I  urge your  active  participation  in  the  months  and years to come. Thank  you  all  tion. your  attenvery  much  for  f TRIBUTE  TO  DORIS  COLEY KENNER-JACKSON HON.  BILL  PASCRELL,  JR. OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, March 15, 2000 Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to call  to  your  attention  the  deeds  of  a  distinguished  singer,  Doris  Coley  Kenner-Jackson of  Passaic,  New  Jersey,  whose  memorial today  celebrates  her  remarkable  talents  and legacy.  She  epitomizes  a  strong  spirit  and never  forgot  from where  she  came. Doris  Coley  Kenner-Jackson  was  born  August  2,  1941  in Wayne  County,  North  Carolina to  the  late  Zeno  and  Ruth  Best  Coley.  She was  the  oldest  of  five  children  born  to  this family.  One  brother,  Leodie,  preceded  her  in death.  The  world  lost  a  truly  remarkable woman  on  February  4,  2000  when  Doris passed  away  at  the  Kaiser  P.  Memorial  Hospital of Sacramento, California. Her  educational  growth  began  in  the  two Goldsboro  City  Schools,  Greenleaf  and  East End,  and  continued  in  Passaic  where  her  family  moved  during  the  late  Nineteen  Fifties. Once  in  New  Jersey  she  continued  her  education,  and  attended  Passaic  High  School. During  high  school,  Doris\u2019  main  pursuit  was music.  It  was  at  this  time  that  she  proved  herself  to be a  remarkable  singer. Always  an  active  and  involved  vocalist, Doris  learned  much  of  her  skill  in  the  church. Music  was  her  passion  and  her  gift  to  the world. Her  love  for music was  deeply  rooted  in gospel.  The  early  years  spent  singing  in  the church  choir  instilled  in  Doris  the  attributes necessary  for  her  to  become  a  stellar  force  in the  music  industry.  It  was  the  small  steps  in the  beginning  of  her  life  that  taught  her  the fundamentals  that  would  make  her  a  role model  to  scores  upon  scores  of  people  worldwide. Doris  has  had  a  remarkable  career,  which has  taken  her  to  the  top  of  the  charts.  While she  was  a  student  at  Passaic  High  School, she  and  three  classmates,  Shirley  Alston Reeves,  Beverly  Lee  and  Addie  Mickie  Harris formed  a  pop  ensemble  that  became  the Shirelles. The  singing  group  eventually  revolutionized the  \u2018\u2018girl  group\u2019\u2019  sound  of  the  Fifties  and  Sixties.  This  success  was  punctuated  by  ten  hit singles  including,  \u2018\u2018Tonight\u2019s  the  Night,\u2019\u2019  \u2018\u2018Will You  Still  Love  Me  Tomorrow?,\u2019\u2019  \u2018\u2018Soldier  Boy,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Mama  Said\u2019\u2019  and  \u2018\u2018Dedicated  to  the  one  I Love.\u2019\u2019  The  latter,  an  American  classic,  featured  Doris  as  the  lead  vocalist.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  this  sound  is  experiencing a  current  renaissance  heralded  by  Britain\u2019s Spice  Girls  who  debuted  in  the  United  States in 1996. This  native  of  North  Carolina,  who  later moved  to New  Jersey,  found  fame  and  fortune around  the  world.  As  a  member  of  the Shirelles,  she  received  numerous  awards  in many  countries.  One  highlight  of  her  life  and career  came  on  January  17,  1996  in  New York  City,  New  York  when  the  Shirelles  were inducted  into  the  Rock  \u2018n\u2019  Roll  Hall  of  Fame  of Cleveland,  Ohio.  To  mark  this  achievement, the  auditorium  of  Passaic  High  School  was named  in  honor  of  the  group.  In  addition, Doris  was  inducted  into  the  Rhythm  &  Blues Foundation. Doris  was  united  in  marriage  to  Alfonza Kenner,  until  his  death.  Together  they  had  two sons,  Antonio  and  Gary.  Later,  she  married Wallace  Jackson  with  whom  she  had  twins, Tracy  Jackson  and  Staci  Jackson  Richardson. All  who  knew  Doris  felt  her  magic  and unique  ability  to  form  a  distinctive  bond  with each  and  every  person  she  met.  The  magic transcended  all  boundaries  and  is  a  true  testament  to  the  loving  kindness  of  her  spirit.  Despite  being  ill,  she  was  performing  concerts until  the  end.  This  includes  a  series  of  shows from  January  8  through  January  15,  2000 aboard a  cruise  ship.

GORE f TO  THE LEAVE  STAR  WARS  MOVIES (Ms. MCKINNEY asked and was given permission  to  address  the  House  for  1 minute.) Ms.  MCKINNEY.  Mr.  Speaker,  17 years  and  over  $40  billion,  one  would hope  that  such an  investment would be directed  towards  upgrading  our schools,  providing  job  training,  or making payments on our national debt. Instead,  this  astronomical  amount has  been  squandered  on  Star  Wars. Now,  they  have  changed  the  name  to National  Missile  Defense,  but  it  is  the same  thing. After  20  years  of  trying,  it still does not work. Reagan started it to beat the Soviets. Now  they  say  we  need  it  to  protect  us from  Iraq.  But  Timothy  McVeigh  was not in Iraq. The greatest  threat  to our country  is having  leadership  that  fails  to  recognize  real  threats.  Instead  of  funding more  government  waste,  deadly  corporate  welfare,  and  a  missile  build-up that  jeopardizes  the  ABM  Treaty,  I suggest  that  we  concentrate  on  our problems at ground zero and leave Star Wars to the movies. f The  SHIMKUS).

Mr. Speaker,  I move  to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 465) expressing the sense of  the  House  of  Representatives  that local,  State,  and  Federal  governments should  collect  and  disseminate  statistics  on  the  number  of  newborn  babies abandoned in public places. The Clerk read as follows: H. RES. 465 Whereas  April  is  Child  Abuse  Prevention Month,  which  provides  Congress  the  opportunity  to  focus  attention  and  raise  awareness  of  the  problem  of  newborn  babies  abandoned in public places; Whereas  the  Department  of  Health  and Human  Services  reports  that,  in  1998,  31,000 babies  were  delivered  and  abandoned  in  hospitals by mothers; Whereas  an  unknown  number  of  newborn babies  are  abandoned  in  dumpsters,  trash bins, alleys, warehouses, and bathrooms; Whereas  the  Department  of  Health  and Human  Services  conducted  an  informal  survey  of  major  newspapers  and  found  that,  in 1998, 105 babies were found abandoned in public  places  in  the  United  States,  of  which  33 were  found  dead,  and  that,  in  1991,  65  babies were  abandoned,  of which  8 were  found  dead; Whereas  national  statistics  on  the  number of  infants abandoned  in public places are not kept,  though  States  are  required  to  submit data  to  the  Department  of  Health  and Human  Services  on  the  number  of  children who  enter  foster  care as a  result of abandonment in general; Whereas  Texas  is  the  only  State  to  have enacted  a  law  designed  to  address  this  social problem,  though  24  other  states  are  considering  such  legislation,  including  Alabama, California,  Colorado,  Florida,  Georgia,  Indiana,  Kansas,  Kentucky,  Maryland,  Minnesota,  New  Jersey,  New  York,  North  Carolina,  Oklahoma,  Pennsylvania,  Tennessee, Connecticut,  Oregon,  Illinois,  Ohio,  Wisconsin, Mississippi, Michigan,  and  New Mexico; and Whereas  there  are  innovative  model  programs  in  Houston,  Mobile,  Minneapolis,  and Syracuse  that  protect  mothers  who  take newborns  to  hospitals  or  some  other  safe haven  rather  than  dumping  them  in  a  trash bin  or  leaving  them  on  a  doorstep:  Now, therefore, be it Resolved,  That  local,  State,  and  Federal statistics  should  be  kept  on  the  number  of babies abandoned in public places. b The  WOOLSEY)  SHIMKUS).  gentleman 1130 SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. Pursuant  to  the  rule,  the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. CASTLE) and  the  gentlewoman  from  California (Ms.  each  will  control  20 minutes. The  Chair  recognizes  the  from Delaware (Mr. CASTLE). Mr.  CASTLE.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume. I  rise  in  support  of  House  Resolution 465, focusing our attention on the thousands  of  infants  who  are  abandoned  in this country every year. In  November  of  1996,  two  college freshmen,  Brian  Peterson  and  his girlfriend,  Amy  Grossberg,  were charged  in  the  death  of  their  newborn son,  found  wrapped  in  plastic  at  a Dumpster  near  a  Newark,  Delaware motel. In June of 1998, the body of a 6-pound baby  boy was  found  in  a  trash  can  at  a Smyrna,  Delaware  car  wash.  The  parents were never found. Today,  two  Virginia  teens  are  fighting  extradition  to  Delaware  where their baby girl was found abandoned on the  floor  of  a  portable  lavatory  on  a housing  construction  site  in  Bear, Delaware. This  is  my  State  of  Delaware  alone, the size of each of our 435 congressional districts by population. Recently,  a  writer  sorted  through 1,000  newspaper  articles  on  infant murders  between  1990  and  1999  and  found 700  cases  in  which  the  mother  killed her  child.  Of  course,  these  were  the cases  where  the  murder  was  committed,  the  mother  was  found,  and  the story was reported in the newspaper. According  to  child  welfare  experts, States  include  infant  abandonment with  the  abandonment  of  children  of other ages in their records, so there are no  specific  figures  on  the  number  of newborns  abandoned  each  year.  Therefore,  it  is  fitting  that  this  resolution calls on  localities, States, and the Federal  Government  to  keep  statistics  on the  number  of  infants  abandoned  in public places each year. With this data, we  will  have  the  ability  to  better  assess the scope of this problem and then take steps to address it. In  fact,  after  13  infants  were  found abandoned  in  the  Houston  area,  Texas became  the  first  State  to  pass  a  law protecting  parents  who  leave  newborns in safe places. In fact, State Representative  Geanie  Morrison,  from  Victoria, Texas, who was  the  sponsor of  this  legislation  breaking  the  ice  on  this  subject, is here with us in the gallery. Many  States,  including  my  State  of Delaware,  are  considering  similar  legislation  designed  to  reduce  the  number of infant deaths. For  more  than  a  decade,  April  has been recognized as Child Abuse Prevention  Month.  During  April,  public  and private  agencies,  community  organizations,  volunteers,  and  concerned  citizens  unite  to  highlight  the  problem  of child  abuse  and  to  educate  the  public about  how  it  can  be  prevented.  Therefore, it is only fitting that the House of Representatives  pass  this  resolution  to focus  the  national  attention  on  the problem of infant abandonment. I urge the adoption of this resolution. Mr.  Speaker,  I  reserve  the  balance  of my time. ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.

Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself  such  time  as  I  may  consume, and  I am honored  to be  sponsoring  this resolution  with  my  colleague,  the  gentleman from Delaware (Mr. CASTLE). Mr.  Speaker,  today\u2019s  resolution,  H. Res.  465,  recognizes  the  necessity  to keep  statistics  on  the  number  of  newborn babies abandoned in public places. This  is  a  horrible  and,  unfortunately, an  increasing  situation.  We  need  additional data so that we can better assess this  growing  problem  so  that  we  can strengthen  our  efforts  to  reduce  it  and prevent it entirely. Too  often,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  turn  on the  evening  news  or  wake  up  to  the morning papers to find out that yet another  baby  has  been  abandoned  in  an alley,  on  a  park  bench,  or  some  other VerDate 20-MAR-2000 03:23 Apr 12, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K11AP7.013 pfrm02 PsN: H11PT1 ",
            "15": "April 11, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:69) H2029 would qualify for funds, funds so small, as  the  gentleman  from  Virginia  (Mr. SCOTT) has  indicated,  they would never be  sufficient  to  do  the  job;  because those  States  that  do  use  the  funds  can use  them  for  any  purpose  that  they choose,  including  carpeting  of  judges\u2019 offices,  paving  tennis  courts,  or  anything,  you  name  it;  there  are  no  restrictions,  and  because  this  bill  continues  to  parrot  the  NRA  line  that  we cannot close the gun enforcement loopholes in the law that allow criminals to rearm  with  guns  and  ammunition  by utilizing  the  \u2018\u2018restoration  of  rights\u2019\u2019 loophole.  In  other  words,  they  pit  gun safety  versus  prosecution  of  gun  violations. I say that enforcement of the law and gun  safety  are  not  positions  that  we have  to  choose  between.  We  can  have both.  That  is  what  we  want  to  do.  So we  know  the majority  in  this  Congress is using this process really as an excuse to  thumb  their  nose  at  the  American people,  who  want  both  gun  safety  and enforcement  legislation.  We  can  and should  have  both.  Somehow  they  are saying  that  process  prevents  them from  coming  to  a  conference  meeting on  the  bipartisan  gun  show  loophole that is begging to be closed. Mr.  Speaker,  I  do  not  think  the  people are going to be fooled, because they know  that  our  leadership  now  is  in  the throes  of  the NRA\u2019s  control. This  leadership  is  being  run  on  this  subject  by the  NRA.  They  reject  the  idea  we  can have  gun  safety  and  gun  enforcement, and  the  truth  is we  can  have  both. The truth  is  that  we  need  both;  and  if  we are  to  do  enforcement,  it  should  be real,  and  not  just  the  political  cover that this bill represents. The  gentlewoman  from  New  York (Mrs. MCCARTHY) and I have introduced the Enforce Act. This  bill  does nothing to  crack  down  on  the  bad  apple  gun dealers,  the  2  percent  who  are  responsible  for  up  to  half  the  guns  that  are traced  back  to  crime.  They  cannot  do that  because  the  NRA  continues  to  resist  any  attempts  to  crack  down  on bad-apple dealers. Unlike the Enforce Act, this bill does nothing  to  fund  the  agencies  with  responsibility  for  investigating  gun crimes,  like  ATF,  Alcohol,  Tobacco and  Firearms.  They  cannot  do  it  because,  again,  the  National  Rifle  Association  does  not  want  it.  They  call  the ATF  \u2018\u2018jack-booted  thugs,\u2019\u2019  but  we  still will  not  give  them  the  resources  that they need to do the enforcement that is being complained about. Unlike  the  Enforce  Act,  this  bill urges  Federal  prosecution  of  gun crimes  without  providing  any  money for  the  Federal  prosecutors\u2019  need.  Unlike  the  Enforce  Act,  this  bill  provides money  to  States  that  does  not  even have  to  be  used  for  enforcement,  but instead  could  be  used  for  any  purposes whatsoever. The  Republican  leadership  wants  us to  forget  that  they  have  been  promising  to  call  a  gun  safety  conference since August  5,  1999, and  that  the anniversary  of  Columbine  is  fast  approaching  without  enacting  into  law  a  single piece  of  Federal  gun  safety  legislation. But  this  bill  does  nothing  to  close  the loophole  that  allows  criminals  to  buy guns at gun  shows. This bill does nothing  to  require  child  safety  locks.  This bill  does  nothing  to  ban  the  importation  of  large-capacity  ammunition clips. REQUEST TO OFFER AMENDMENT TO H.R. 4051 other other entertain  Mr.  CONYERS. Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  for that  reason,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  I  ask unanimous consent to offer the Senatepassed  gun  safety  provisions  as  an amendment to this bill. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Under suspension  of  the  rules,  any  amendment  is  to  be  included  in  the  original motion,  in  this  case  by  the  gentleman from Florida. The  Chair  will  not  proposals to amend. Mr.  CONYERS.  Mr.  Speaker,  in  that case,  then  I  would  like  to  ask  unanimous  consent  to  offer  the  McCarthyConyers  measure  called  the  Enforce Act  as  an  amendment  in  the  nature  of a substitute to this bill. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  To  the gentleman  from  Michigan,  the  Chair can  only  reiterate  what  was  said  before. Under suspension of the rules, any amendment  is  to  be  included  in  the original  motion,  in  this  case  by  the gentleman from Florida. The  Chair  will  not  entertain  proposals to amend. Mr.  CONYERS.  Mr.  Speaker,  what  I am  finding out  then  is  that we are now using  the  rules  to  prevent  any  amendments and alternatives to this measure whatsoever  from  our  side  of  the  aisle. Is that correct? The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  pending motion is not amendable. 1230 Mr.  CONYERS.  Mr.  Speaker,  we  regret the process. We have never been to the  Committee  on  Rules.  We  have never  been  to  the  full  committee,  the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr.  who  has  been  a principle  author  this  bill  and  a  cosponsor. Mr.  EHRLICH.  quick points. One,  congratulations  to  the  chairman,  the  gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr. MCCOLLUM). It is a terrific bill. Secondly,  I  share  concerns  with  respect  to  mandatory  minimum  sentences.  However,  when  it  deals  with gun-toting  criminals,  felons  who  are caught  with  guns,  minimum  mandatory  sentences  are  clearly  appropriate. Third,  contrary  to  what  we  just heard,  the  NRA  and  Handgun  Control supports  Project  Exile.  Handgun  Control supports Project Exile. Fourth,  contrary  to  what  we  just heard  with  respect  to  allowable  uses under  Project  Exile,  under  this  bill  we have  police  prosecutors,  courts,  probation  officers,  the  juvenile  justice  sysEHRLICH),  Mr.  Speaker,  five b of  The tem, prison expansion, criminal history record  improvements,  and  case  management program  innovation. They are allowable uses under this bill. Fifth  and  finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  my personal  road  here  is  an  interesting one.  I  have  complained  an  awful  lot  in this  House  about  the  failure  of  both sides  to  talk  about  gun  control  effectively. I  heard  a  year  and  a  half  ago  about Richmond.  I  have  gone  down  to  Richmond. I have talked to the prosecutors, the  Governor,  the  gentlemen  down there.  It  just  works.  It may  not  be  the gun  control  agenda  from  the  left,  but Project  Exile  just  works,  and  it  works because  the  State  legislature  is  involved  passing  statutes  that  comport with  the  Federal  statutes  so  we  do  not federalize  the  criminal  justice  system, prosecutors  work  together.  Egos  are put aside, unbelievably,  in this town so that  State  and  Federal  prosecutors work  together.  Thirdly,  the  private sector funds the communications effort that  educates  the  bad  guys  that  they should  not  carry  guns  on  the  streets. That  is  what  the  minority  party  opposes today. Mr.  Speaker,  this  is  a  great  piece  of legislation.  I  again  congratulate  my good  friend,  the  gentleman  from  Florida (Mr. MCCOLLUM). Mr.  SCOTT.  Mr.  Speaker,  minutes  to  the  gentlewoman  York (Mrs. MCCARTHY). Mrs.  MCCARTHY  of  New  York.  Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the  gentleman  for yielding  time  to  me,  and  I  thank  the gentleman  from  Michigan  (Mr.  CONI  yield  4 from New YERS). Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that we were not  able  to  work  together  on  this  bill, because I think it could have been even a better bill  than what  it  is.  I will  support H.R. 4051 with the hopes that when it  gets  to  the  Senate,  that  we  can  improve  it  to  the  point where  it will  help all 50 States. Members  need  to  understand  what they  are  voting  on  today.  This  Project Exile bill  is not  the  same Project Exile program  as  most  Members  know  it. The  Project  Exile  program  that  occurred  in  Richmond,  Virginia,  was  a successful  Federal,  State  and  local partnership  to  increase  gun  prosecutions. The  legislation  before  us  block grants more  than  $1 million  to  just  six States  over  5  years.  These  States  include  Virginia,  Florida,  Texas,  Colorado,  Louisiana,  and  South  Carolina, according  to  the  bill\u2019s  sponsor.  That leaves  44 States without  funding  to  enhance gun enforcement. I  personally  think  if  we  are  going  to do  this,  all  the  States  should  be  involved  in  this.  The  legislation  permits these  six  States  to  use  the  money  on gun  enforcement.  They  could  also  use it  on  juvenile  justice  programs,  correction officers, and public awareness programs. Earlier this year, the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr.  and  I  introduced  legislation  supported  by  the CONYERS)  VerDate 20-MAR-2000 03:15 Apr 12, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K11AP7.034 pfrm02 PsN: H11PT1 ",

            "39": "April 11, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:69) H2053 property  owners  to  the  government with the appropriate threshold of a preponderance of the evidence. The  compromise  also  limits  the  appointment  of  court-appointed  lawyers to  indigent  claimants  whose  primary residence  is  subject  to  forfeiture.  I want  to  say  that  there  is  one  concern that  I  have  and  I  think  a  couple  of my colleagues  have  as  well  as  it  relates  to this  legislation,  and,  that  is,  that  we have  a  continuing  reservation  that  the removal  of  the  cost  bond  requirement could  impair  the  asset  forfeiture  program in the future. We  know  that  the  Justice  Department  is  already  overwhelmed  with challenges  to  asset  seizures,  and  I  am fearful  that  the  removal  of  the  cost bond could further paralyze that effort. But  let  me  say  this,  I  hope  to  and  I know my colleagues who stood with me a year ago hope to work with the chairman  and  the  committee  to  oversee  the implementation of cost bond provisions requiring  up-front  certification  and posthearing  penalties  and  ensure  that my  fears  do  not  become  a  reality  for law  enforcement.  But  overall,  Mr. Speaker, this is a victory for the American  people.  I  want  to  salute  the  Committee  on  the  Judiciary  and  its  great chairman. I urge support for this bill. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. PEASE).  Without  objection,  the  gentleman  from  Michigan  (Mr.  will  control  the  time  previously  granted to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. CONYERS) JACKSON-LEE). I  yield There was no objection. Mr.  CONYERS.  Mr.  Speaker,  myself 2 minutes. I would  like  to  begin  by  pointing  out that  the  chairman  of  this  committee and  I  have  worked  together  on  this measure  for  at  least  a  couple  of  Congresses.  I  have  been  working  on  it, also,  unbeknownst  to  the  gentleman from Illinois  in the Committee on Government Reform.  I think we have come quite  a  long  way.  The  bill  retains  the core  of  some  of  the  main  reforms  that was in Hyde-Conyers. We  have  adopted  the  Senate  version. But  the  shifting  of  the  burden  of  proof is  very  important.  The  appointment  of counsel  is  a  critical  improvement.  The return  of  property  in  case  of  substantial  hardship  is  very  important.  And the  innocent  owner  defense  is  now strong  in  the  bill.  The  claim  for  property  damages  while  in  the  government\u2019s  custody  is  a  valid  concern.  And an  award  of  interest.  The  bill  allows prejudgment  interest  to  be  awarded when  cash  is  improperly  seized  by  the government. And we eliminate the cost of  bond  which  would  be  a  part  of  the current  requirement  that  a  claimant challenging  a  civil  asset  forfeiture  file a cost of bond. Who  would  have  believed  that  under our  current  law,  the  government  can confiscate  an  individual\u2019s  private  property  on  a  mere  showing  of  probable cause?  Then  even  though  a  person  has never  been  arrested,  not  to  mention convicted,  of  a  crime,  the  government b of on  1658  WEINER),  SWEENEY),  HUTCHINSON)  requires  the  person  to  file  an  action  to prove  that  the  property  is  not  subject to  forfeiture  to  get  the  property  back. 1400 It  is  important  that  we  have  asset forfeiture,  but  this  puts  it  under  controls that have not existed before. Mr.  Speaker,  I  reserve  the  balance  my time. Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  11\u20442 minutes  to the  gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr. a  distinguished  member  of the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr.  WEINER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  in support  of  the  Senate  amendments  to H.R.  1658,  and  I  want  to  commend  the gentleman  from  Illinois  (Chairman HYDE),  our  chairman,  for  his  year-long effort  to  reform  our  asset  forfeiture laws.  The  gentleman  quite  literally wrote  the  book  on  the  subject.  When the  history  is written  of  his  prodigious work  in  this House,  this  certainly warrants mention. Last  year,  a  somewhat  divided House considered  H.R.  1658.  While  it  garnered the  support  of  the  majority  of  our  colleagues,  it  was  adamantly  opposed  by the administration, as well as by  every major  law  enforcement  group.  Because of  this opposition,  I offered, along with the  gentleman  from  Arkansas  (Mr. and  the  gentleman  from (Mr.  a  substitute H.R.  the  floor  of  the New  York  version  of  House. The  substitute  would  have  made needed  reforms  by  placing  the  burden of proof on the Government to prove by a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that property  seized  was  used  in  an  illegal activity.  It  would  have  allowed  for counsel  to  be  appointed  in  those  proceedings. It would have protected  innocent owners, and  it would have allowed property to be returned to claimants in instances of hardship. It  was,  I  thought,  a  balanced  approach  that  had  the  support  of  all major  law  enforcement  organizations, as  well  as  155  of  my  colleagues.  That amendment  failed,  although  it  had some  support,  and  many  of  us  voted against the base bill for that reason. Mr. Speaker,  today\u2019s  amendment,  today\u2019s  bill  I  am  pleased  to  vote  in  favor of.  It  puts  the  burden  of  proof where  it should  be,  on  the  Government;  and  it rightfully  protects  the  owners  and spouses  and  children,  if  they  can  show they were not  involved  in  illegal activity. Perhaps,  most  importantly,  today\u2019s bill  has  the  approval  of  the  men  and women  of  law  enforcement.  Like  our substitute,  today\u2019s  bill  allows  civil asset  forfeiture  to  continue  to  be  used as  a  tool  by  police  and  prosecutors across  the  country  to  shut  down  crack houses  and  seize  drug-running  speedboats. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the authors of this  compromise  and  my  colleagues who voted in favor of reform originally. Mr.  CONYERS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself  such  time  as  I  may  consume, merely  to point out  in  the colloquy between  the  gentleman  from Georgia  and the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. HYDE),  the  distinguished  chairman  of the  committee,  that  I  stand  in  agreement about the interpretation given by the  chairman  of  section  983A(2)(c)(2), which  dealt  with  the  claimant\u2019s  interests  in  such  property  and  provide  customary  documentary  evidence  of  such evidence,  if  available,  and  state  that the claim is not frivolous. Mr.  Speaker,  I  just  wanted  to  join  in a  clarification  of  the  intent  that,  for example,  a  person  should not  be  barred from  challenging  an  improper  forfeiture  if  he  or  she  has misplaced  a  receipt or  if the person does not have the evidence on hand. I think that response is  consistent  with  the  gentleman  from Illinois  (Mr.  HYDE)  and  the  gentleman from  Georgia,  and  I  just  wanted  to weigh in on that. This has  taken quite awhile, but  it  is an  important  measure,  and  my  compliments  are  out  to  the  gentleman from  Illinois  (Mr.  HYDE),  the  chairman of  the  committee,  and  to  all  of  the Members  who  have  gone  through  a  rethinking  process  to  bring  the  bill  to the  kind  of  support  that  I  believe  it  is enjoying on the floor this afternoon. Mr.  Speaker,  I  began  looking  at  this matter  from  the  old Government Operations  Committee,  and  I  was  very pleased  to  learn  that  the  gentleman from  Illinois  had,  indeed,  studied  the matter,  had  put  together  his  thoughts in  a  book  on  the  matter,  and  it  led  us to  bringing  forth  a  bill  jointly  that now  has  the  imprimatur,  I  believe,  of most of the Members in both bodies. It  is  in  that  spirit  that  we  will  want to  make  sure  that  it  is  implemented fairly and that it adds to the good body of  law  that  comes  out  of  the  House Committee on the Judiciary. Mr.  Speaker,  with  those  remarks,  reserve the balance of our time. Mr.  HYDE.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  self such time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  I  wish  to  express  my gratitude  again  to  the  gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr.  and  his  staff and  everyone  who  worked  on  this  bill. We  did  not  mention  Jon  Dudas  and Rick  Filkins.  I  just  want  to  say, George Fishman who  is sitting here, he was  the  single  most  indispensable  element  of  this  bill,  and  I  am  grateful  to him. Mr.  BARR  of  Georgia.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like  to  thank  Mr.  for  working  so  rigorously  to  come  to  a  reasonable  agreement  with the  Senate  on  civil  asset  forfeiture  reform.  The compromise  is  fair  and  will  restore  fairness  to this process. Civil  asset  forfeiture  is  a  mechanism  allowing  law  enforcement  authorities  to  seize  assets  such  as  homes,  property,  cash,  and  cars that  are  used  in  furtherance  of  criminal  activity.  However,  in  recent  years,  the  laws  have been  used  overly  broadly,  and  have  been cited  by  civil  libertarians  as  excessive  and open  to abuse. One  of  the  most  important  challenges  Congress  faces  is  balancing  individual  liberties against  the  need  for  effective  law  enforcement.  Generally,  our  laws  do  this  fairly  well.

The  bill  also  contains  a  provision  that tightens  restrictions  on  \u2018\u2018browsing\u2019\u2019  of  taxpayer information  by  IRS  employees.  The  IRS  is  required  to  notify  taxpayers  after  the  Treasury Inspector  General  for  Tax  Administration  determines  that  a  taxpayer\u2019s  return  or  return  information  has  been  disclosed  or  inspected without authorization. Finally  this  bill  levels  the  field  between  the IRS  and  the  Taxpayer.  It  accomplishes  this first  by  excluding  interest  paid  by  the  IRS  from the  income  of  individual  taxpayers.  Under  current  law,  taxpayers  cannot  deduct  interest  that they  pay  to  the  IRS,  but  they  have  to  pay taxes  on  any  interest  payment  they  receive from  the  IRS. Secondly,  it  provides  access  to  the  working law  of  the  IRS.  All  final,  written  legal  interpretations  issued  to  IRS  employees  that  affect  a member  of  the  public  are  made  publicly  available.  If  taxpayers  are  expected  to  comply  with an  IRS  interpretation  of  the  law,  the  interpretation  should  be  available.  Currently,  taxpayers have  no  way  of  determining  whether  the  IRS applying  the  tax  laws  evenly  across  the  U.S. This  will  permit  taxpayers  to  determine  what  is the  appropriate  legal  analysis  applicable  to their  facts and  circumstances. As  the  complexity  of  the  tax  code  increases, the  need  to  pretect  taxpayers  has  also  increased.  We  must  be  diligent  and  ensure Americans  receive  the  protection  they  deserve.  This  bill  takes  the  steps  necessary  to endure  that  taxpayers  are  treated  fairly  and the  information  they  disclose  is  protected.  It extends  the  reforms began  in 1998 by  reigning in  and  finally  putting  the  taxpayer  on  an  equal footing with  the  IRS. Mr. HOUGHTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

HOUGHTON)  on f SENSE  OF  CONGRESS  ON  CLINTON/ GORE  TAX  HIKES Mr. MCINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 467) expressing the sense of  the  House  of  Representatives  that the  tax  and user  fee  increases  proposed by  the  Clinton/Gore  administration  in their  fiscal  year  2001  budget  should  be adopted. The Clerk read as follows: H. RES. 467 Whereas  on  February  7,  2000,  President Clinton and Vice President Gore submitted a budget  for  fiscal  year  2001  that  raises  taxes and  fees  on  working  families  by  $116  billion over  5  years,  creates  84  new  Federal  programs,  places  Government  spending  increases  on  auto-pilot,  and  fails  to  offer  any serious  proposal  to  strengthen  social  security or medicare; Whereas  over  the  next  decade  the  ClintonGore  budget would  spend  $1.3  trillion  on  bigger  Government\u2014consuming  70  percent  of the  projected  $1.9  trillion  in  budget  surpluses\u2014thus  spending  more  for  the  Federal bureaucracy,  and  less  for  the American  family; Whereas  as  part  and fee increases\u2014 (1) the President proposes to raise taxes by $12.8 billion on  the  insurance products which Americans  rely  on  to  protect  their  families, homes, and businesses, (2)  the  President  proposes  a  stealth  our  children  by  raising  the  death  tax  billion, (3)  the  President  asks  us  to  increase  taxes on  energy  by  $1.5  billion  at  a  time  of  rising energy  prices  and  increasing  dependence  on foreign oil, and (4)  the  President  wants  to  raise  medicare premiums and other health care costs by $3.2 billion  at  the  very  time  we  are  trying  to  insure  our  seniors\u2019  health  security  by  preserving and protecting medicare; and Whereas the President\u2019s solution is to take hard-earned  money  and  send  it  to  Washington  where  politicians  can  spend  it:  Now, therefore, be it Resolved,  That  is  it  the  of Representatives that\u2014 (1)  despite  having  successfully  balanced the budget and created budget surpluses, (2) despite having protected  social  security and  restored  the  integrity of  the  social  security trust fund, (3)  despite  the  fact  that  in  1999  governments  at  all  levels  collected  $9,562  in  taxes for every man, woman and child, (4) despite the fact our tax burden is at 20.0 percent  of  gross  domestic  product\u2014a  postWorld War II record high, and (5)  despite  the  fact  that  our  oversight  activities  have  identified  billions  of  taxpayer\u2019s dollars  that  are  subject  to  waste,  fraud  and abuse, the  Congress  should  support  the  adoption  of the  package  of  tax  and  user  fee  increases proposed  by  the Clinton/Gore  administration in  their  fiscal  year  2001  budget,  as  reestimated  by  the  Joint  Committee  on  Taxation, and as outlined below. of  the  $116  billion  in  tax tax  on by  $3.5 sense  of  the  House PROPOSED  TAX  AND  FEE  INCREASES (Millions  of  dollars) 2000\u201305 I.

It  has  been  a long  time  in  coming,  but  I  am  convinced it is the right thing to do. Mr.  Speaker,  I  reserve  the  balance  my time. Mr.  LAFALCE.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  support of H.R. 4067,  the Business Checking Modernization Act. I, too, would like to associate myself  with  all  of  the  remarks  of  the gentleman  from  Iowa  (Mr.  LEACH),  the distinguished  chairman  of  the  Committee on Banking and Financial Services. As  a  result  of  our  bipartisan work  on this and other legislation, today we are able  to  take  another  step  in  the  modernization  of  our  financial  services  industry.  The  ban  on  interest-bearing checking  accounts  was  adopted  in  the Great  Depression  out  of  fear  that banks  seeking  business  accounts would bid  against  each  other  with  higher  interest  rates  and  thus  contribute  to bank insolvencies. In  the  1980s,  Congress  recognized these  concerns  had  faded  and  removed the  legislative prohibition against paying  interest  on  the  checking  accounts of  individuals.  Of  course,  Congress  was responding  to  market  forces,  too,  and the  tremendous  disintermediation  that had taken place. Today we complete that work by permitting  the  payment  of  interest  on business  demand  deposits.  This  is something  we  should  have  done  years ago. We do it today. The  current  law  and  market  conditions  prevent  many  small  businesses from  obtaining  easy  access  to  interestbearing  checking  accounts.  For  this reason,  the  repeal  of  the  ban  on  interest-bearing  business  checking  accounts is  strongly  supported  by  the  business community.  A  yes  vote  for  H.R.  4067 promotes  healthy  competition  within the  financial  services  community  for commercial  checking  accounts,  which can  only  benefit  the  business  community,  particularly  the  small  business community,  with  more  efficient,  costeffective financial services. Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  the  balance  of my  time,  to  control  the  time,  to  the gentlewoman  from  Oregon  (Ms. HOOLEY). HOOLEY)  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore. Without objection,  the  gentlewoman  from  Oregon  (Ms.  will  control  the time  of  the  gentleman  from  New  York (Mr. LAFALCE.) There was no objection. Mr. LEACH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  let  me  first  express  my enormous  gratitude  to  the  gentleman from  New  York  (Mr.  for  his tremendous  cooperation  on  this  issue, as  well  as  the  minority  party  in  general. But  then  I  would  like  to  note  that this  is  a  bill  that  has  been  the  bedrock LAFALCE)  concern  of  one  Member  of  the  United States  Congress  and  that  is  the  gentleman  from  Washington  (Mr. METCALF), who  is retiring at the end of the  year.  If  there  is  a  bill  and  sponsor which  have  been  identified  together more,  I  do  not  know  what  it  is  in  the Congress. Mr.  Speaker,  express  to  the  gentleman  from  Washington  (Mr. particular  appreciation  and gratitude for his thoughtfulness on this piece  of  legislation,  but  also  for  his enormous  thoughtfulness  on  the  committee  on  which  he  serves.  I  am  very grateful  for  his  leadership  and  friendship. Mr. Speaker,  I yield  5 minutes  gentleman  from  Washington  to  the (Mr. METCALF)  I  METCALF). b LEACH)  1615 Mr. METCALF. Mr.  Speaker,  I would like  to  express  my  appreciation  of  the gentleman  from  Iowa  (Mr.  and the gentleman from New York (Mr. LAFALCE),  the  ranking  member,  for  their strong  support  of  repealing  an  archaic Great  Depression  era  statute  preventing banks from offering interest on business checking accounts. I am pleased to say that H.R. 4067 enjoys  bipartisan  support  and  was  passed by  the  full  Committee  on  Banking  and Financial Services by voice vote. The  current  prohibition  against banks  offering  interest-bearing  business  checking  accounts  makes  no sense.  Allow  me  to  highlight  what  a couple  of  banks  have  said  to  me  about this issue. A  banker  from  North  Carolina  said repeal  would  save  maintaining  a  separate  sweep  money  market  account  and expenses  related  to  tracking  the  number of sweeps per month to ensure compliance. A  banker  from  Texas  said,  small businesses have a right to earn interest on  their money  and  national  and State banks  should  have  a  right  to  offer  this service. A  banker  from  Wisconsin  said  that they  use  a  sweep  account  to  pay  interest  but  that  repealing  the  prohibition would  make  their  job  easier  and  more competitive. A  banker  from  Nebraska  summed  up his  views  even  more  succinctly  about abolishing  this  statute.  The  sooner  the better. We  should  vote  today  to  remove  this unnecessary  regulation  and  allow banks  the  opportunity  to  better  address  business  concerns  of  their  local communities  without  having  to  undergo costly, cumbersome procedures. Federal  Reserve  Chairman  Alan Greenspan has written in support of repealing  this  prohibition  against  paying interest on business checking accounts. The  legislation  also  enjoys  broadbased  support  among  others:  The  U.S. Chamber  of  Commerce;  the  world\u2019s largest  business  federation,  the  National  Federation  of  Independent  Businesses,  which  represents  over  600,000 small  and  independent  businesses; METCALF),  simple.  interest  It  allows on  their America\u2019s  Community  Bankers;  the American  Banking  Association;  and the  Association  for  Financial  Professionals  which  represents  over  10,000 cash  management  professionals  within the corporate sector. Let  us  pass  this  bill  today  and  move forward  to  help  our  financial  institutions  be  more  competitive  in  the  marketplace  and  free  small  business  from outdated regulations. Ms. HOOLEY of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself  such  time  as  I may  consume. Mr.  Speaker,  I  want  to  thank  the gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr.  LAFALCE),  the  ranking  member,  and  the gentleman  from  Iowa  (Chairman LEACH),  as  well  as  the  gentleman  from Washington  (Mr.  for  their leadership  in  bringing  to  the  floor today  H.R.  4067,  the  Business  Checking Modernization Act. This  bill  is  very  businesses  to  earn  checking accounts. The  ban  on  paying  interest  on  commercial  accounts  was  adopted  during the  Depression  for  policy  reasons  that are  no  longer  relevant  today.  The banking  regulators  all  agree  that  this legislation is overdue. This legislation will promote healthy competition  within  the  financial  services  community  for  commercial  checking  accounts,  which  will  benefit  all businesses,  especially  small  businesses who  will  now  be  able  to  earn  interest on the business checking accounts. Currently,  business  customers  are able  to  earn  interest  on  their  bank checking  accounts  only  by  placing their  funds  in  banks  that  are  able  to offer  sweep  accounts.  So  this  is  really good  for  big  businesses  and  big  banks where  they  can  afford  to  offer  these sweep accounts. Other  businesses  use  securities  firms that  offer  liberal  check  writing  services  or  ATM  access  or  similar  services through  interest-paying  transaction accounts. This  compromise  legislation  appropriately  provides  a  3-year  transition period  so  that  financial  institutions that offer sweep accounts or other concessions  in  lieu  of  interest  can  make necessary  changes  in  their  pricing  to accommodate  the  repeal  of  this  prohibition. Finally,  during  this  transition  period, all insured depository institutions will  be  able  to  offer  interest  through  a 24-transfer  per  month,  money  market accounts. Again,  this  is a very  simple bill,  long overdue,  that allows businesses  to  earn interest  on  their  checking  accounts with  a  3-year  period  for  implementation. Because  the  bill  opens  up  competition  in  the  business  checking  market in  a  fair  and  equitable  manner,  I  urge my  colleagues  to  support  its  adoption. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LEACH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

They are angry. They are  all  preparing  for  that Million Mom March  on  Mother\u2019s  Day,  and  they  are angry.  They  do  not  get  it;  they  do  not understand it. They feel that no matter how  much  we  argue,  no  matter  how hard  we  work,  our  efforts  to  pass  common sense gun safety legislation and to strengthen  the  enforcement  of  gun safety  laws  seem  to  be  blocked  by  this Congress. The cries of the American people, the cries  that  so  many  of  my  colleagues and  I have tried to echo and amplify  in this Chamber,  have  fallen  on  deaf  ears. While  our  constituents  demand  real concrete action, the Republican leadership  puts  up  impassable  roadblocks  to progress  on  any  front.  Any  bill  with teeth,  any  bill  that  will  really  enforce gun  safety  laws  and will  really  prevent children  and  felons  from  getting  guns, is  immediately  disqualified  from  consideration. I  do  believe  the  American  people  get it.  They  are  on  to  the  tactics  of  the NRA  and  its  friends  in  this  Congress. So it is time for Congress to pay attention  to  the  American  people,  not  just lip  service.  The  Juvenile  Justice  Conference  Committee  should  meet  now, and it should not stop meeting until we have  a  real  bill  to  consider, with  effective  common  sense  gun  safety  and  enforcement provisions. Preventing  the  committee  from meeting  and  blocking  the  debate  from happening is undemocratic. We have no room  for  these  tactics.  I  urge  my  colleagues to support this motion. Mr.  CONYERS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  include  for  the  a  letter  recently signed  by  myself  and  the  gentleman from  Illinois  (Chairman  HYDE)  to Chairman HATCH asking that we have a Juvenile Justice Conference meeting. RECORD HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE JUDICIARY, ON THE Washington, DC, April 11, 2000. Hon. ORRIN G. HATCH, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN HATCH:  We  write  to  reconference  meeting quest  a  juvenile  justice  as soon as possible. As  you  are  aware,  in  the  last  two  months, we  have  witnessed  a  succession  of  gun  violence  tragedies.  We  have  been  shocked  by  a six-year-old shooting a six-year-old in Mount Morris  Township,  Michigan.  We  have  seen  a nursing home held hostage and a mass shooting  in  Pittsburgh.  In  February,  Memphis firefighters  responding  to  a  call  were  shot and  killed  by  a  disturbed  man.  It  is  clear that  the  Nation  would  like  Congress  to  respond. We know  that  there  is not  complete  agreement  on  all  of  the  issues  before  the  Conference. We  also  recognize  the  need  for  compromise. We have already agreed  in principle to  proposed  language  to  reduce  the  waiting period to 24 hours in most cases, but are still trying  to  resolve  appropriate  \u2018\u2018safety  hatch\u2019\u2019 exceptions. We  have  pledged  to  each  other  to  begin anew negotiations. We believe, however, that beginning  the  work  of  the  Conference  will play  a  constructive  role  in  the  necessary process of narrowing our differences. We  appreciate  request. Sincerely, your  consideration  of  this JOHN HENRY J. HYDE, Chairman, House Judiciary Committee. CONYERS, Jr., Ranking  Member, House  Judiciary Committee. HYDE) Mr. for CARSON),  of  Texas.  gentleman  Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  my  pleasure  to yield  41\u20442 minutes  to  the  gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE), a member of the Committee on the Judiciary, for 4 minutes. Ms.  JACKSON-LEE  Speaker,  I  thank  the  yielding me time. Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  say  to  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  HYDE),  I think  I  was  on  the  floor  earlier  today and  acknowledged  that  the  legislation that  we  were  debating,  the  civil  asset forfeiture  law,  was  truly  a  bipartisan legislative  initiative.  It  had  wound  its way  to  the  floor,  and  we  were  glad  to support  it  as  both  Democrats  and  Republicans. I  can  truly  say  today  that  where  we are today represents at least bipartisan commitment  on  behalf  of  the  House  of Representatives.  So  I  thank  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Chairman  for  being  part  of  this  debate,  but  as well  acknowledging  that  the motion  to instruct  as  offered  by  the  ranking member  pursuant  to  his  leadership, along  with  myself  and  the  gentlewoman  from  Indiana  (Ms.  the gentlewoman  from  California  (Ms. MILLENDER-MCDONALD), and the gentlewoman  from  New  York  (Ms.  MCCARTHY), is in fact the right way to go. Just  a  few  hours  ago  I  took  issue with the Project Exile, not because the State  of  Texas  might  not  have  the  opportunity  to  be  a  participant,  but  I used the term  \u2018\u2018holistic.\u2019\u2019 That is why I think  this  motion  to  instruct  is  effective, because it talks about the holistic approach  to  gun  regulation.  It  acknowledges  that  we  do  have  a  Constitution,  but  in  fact  it  talks  about preventing  children  from  getting  guns. That  is  the  angst  of  what  all  of  us  are crying  out,  that  is  the  pain  of  Columbine,  that  is  the  pain  of  Kentucky, that  is  the  pain  of  Arkansas,  when  our children get guns and do violence. The  picture  of  this  precious  life  reflects when a child has gotten a gun.  It has  nothing  to  do  with  Project  Exile and  locking  up  grown  people  that  have guns.  It  has  a  lot  to  do  with  keeping guns  out  of  the  hands  of  children.  The motion to  instruct talks about keeping guns out of the hands of children. I would hope that we could encourage the  other  body  to  sit  down  and meet.  I would  hope  that  we,  Members  of  the House of Representatives, now knowing that  the  NRA  and  Handgun,  Inc.,  is supporting this motion to instruct that deals  specifically  with  access  to  guns and  keeping  them  away  from  children, can we not have a meeting of the minds to save lives? Just  last  week  in  my  district,  a young  boy  took  four  pistols,  I  did  not say one,  I did not  say two or  three, but I said four, in his knapsack, if you will, to  his  school.  That  shows  that  locking up  criminals,  which  is  extremely  important,  that  use  guns,  and  I  am  a strong  supporter  of  that,  it  requires  us to  have  gun  prevention;  it  requires  us to  hold  adults  responsible  when  they have guns, and allow them to get in the hands of children. So  what  I  say  today  is  can  we  not stand  on  the  floor  of  the  House  with the motion  to  instruct  and  have  it  embedded not only in our heart, but in our action?  Can  we  realize  that  this  life would not have been  saved on  the basis only  of  locking  up  that  criminal  who had a gun?  It would  likewise have been saved  with  a  trigger  lock.  It  would likewise  have  been  saved  with  holding adults  responsible  for  letting  guns  get in the hands of children. The  American  Association  of  Pediatrics has put  it  in the right way. This  is a  health  phenomenon.  We  are  losing more  children\u2019s  lives  through  guns.  In 1997,  there  were  32,000  firearm-related deaths; 4,000 of those victims were children  and  adolescents  20  years  of  age and younger. So the American Association of Pediatrics  has  said  that  the  most  important thing is that we decrease the number of guns in the hands of our children and in the hands of this Nation. Guns,  yes.  Guns  are  something  that we  happen  to  own  in  this  country,  and I recognize that.  I recognize the second amendment.  But  I  think  it  is  important  that  we  also  recognize  that  we collectively  can  save  lives.  I  would hope  that  the  mutual  work  of  those  of us  who  have  offered  this  motion  to  instruct, and I would hope that the ranking member and chairman of  this Committee  on  the  Judiciary  will  find  the momentum  to  move  us  forward  to  holistically  approach  this,  gun  safety, gun  regulation,  gun  wisdom,  and,  of course,  guns  that  are  in  the  hands  of individuals  that  will  not  cause  us  to lose lives. Mr.  HYDE.  Mr.  Speaker,  finding  myself  with  more  time  than  I  need,  I would  be  pleased  to  yield  2  minutes  to the  gentlewoman  from  Texas  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE). Mr. very Ms.  JACKSON-LEE  of  Texas.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  gentleman  much for yielding me time. Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  in  particular  to  read  the  statement  of  the American  Association  of  Pediatrics, and  that  is  that  because  firearms-related  injury  to  children  is  associated with  deaths  and  severe  morbidity  and is  a  significant  public  health  problem, child  health  care  professionals  can  and should  provide  effective  leadership  in efforts to stem this epidemic. The  statement  concludes  that  while there has been a slight decrees  in numbers  in  the  last  few  years,  the  number of  victims  of  firearm-related  injuries constitutes  a  public  health  problem that  must  be  addressed.  Therefore, they  recognize  the  importance  of  a  variety  of  countermeasures,  educational, VerDate 20-MAR-2000 04:04 Apr 12, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K11AP7.163 pfrm02 PsN: H11PT1 ",

So  by  being  able  to  develop  these policies  and working with  the  administration  and  the  Secretary  of  Energy and the work that has gone on to try to help  stabilize  the  market,  which  I  believe  they have gone  to great measures to  do,  along  with  this  legislation,  we are  going  to  begin  to  make  sure  that what we  have  gone  through  in  the  past does not happen again. I tell people that the original one was a  bad  movie  and  the  sequels  have  not been  any  better  since  and,  hopefully, we  never  have  to  witness  this  particular situation again in the future. I  would  like  to  thank  the  chairman and  the  people  who  were  involved  and look  forward  to  advancing  this  legislation. Mr. BOUCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Rhode Island (Mr. WEYGAND). Mr.  WEYGAND.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  want to  thank  the  gentleman  from  Virginia (Mr.  for  yielding  me  the time, as well as our colleague,  the gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  for allowing  us  to  move  forward  this bill. The Northeast  has  traditionally  been a  geographically  hard  location  for much  transportation  of  resources,  like home  heating  oil  and  gasoline. We  also have  a  very  older  style  of  architecture which  often  causes  us  to  have  very  inefficient  buildings  and,  unfortunately, that  leak  during  the  wintertime  of heat and resources and energy. We also have a much colder environment in the Northeast than most parts of the country.  All  these  factors  lead  to  us  as being  big  consumers  of  home  heating oil. Unfortunately, also over the years we have  reduced  the  amount  of  inventory that  we  have  traditionally  had  the  capability of keeping in the Northeast. In 1991  we  had  about  4  million  barrels  of home  heating  oil  on  reserve  in  the Northeast. Since the Gulf War, we have traditionally  built  it  up,  to  last  year we  had  about  17  million  barrels  on hand.  But  this  year  we  dropped  to  almost  an  all-time  low  back  down  to about 4.5 million barrels. Inventory  is  an  important  part  of making  sure  that  the Northeast has  an adequate  supply  to  provide  for  home heating oil. This bill will go a long way to  improving  the  inventory.  I  compliment  the  members  from  the  majority  side  for  bringing  this  bill  forward that  we  have  been  working  so  hard  on. We must recognize, though, that only 2 million barrels is hardly a drop in the bucket  to what we  really need.  I would hope  that  as we move  this  bill  through conference  that  they  would  look  at  increasing  the  home  heating  oil  reserve to in the neighborhood of 3 or 4 million barrels  versus  the  2  million  barrels that is proposed. We  also  must  though. We have  to  do  other  things, look  at  alternative MARKEY),  SANDERS),  sources  of  energy  such  as  natural  gas, such  as  making  sure  we  have  solar power.  We  must  also  provide  the  kinds of  tax  incentives we  need  for  conservation.  That  is  for  better  winterization programs,  for  building  materials  and other things that will help enhance and reduce  the  amount  of  energy  loss  that we  have  in  our  buildings.  All  of  these elements taken in composite will make us a more efficient user of energy, such as petroleum products. I  hope  that  as  we  begin  to  move  forward  with  this  session  and  as  we  wrap up before this  fall, we will truly have a number of  tax  incentives  for winterization  and  conservation,  alternative sources of energy, as well as  improving our  stocks  of  inventory,  as  we  are under this bill. I thank both the majority and minority  for bringing this bill  forward. I also want to compliment my colleagues who have been working so hard on this, particularly  the  gentleman  from  Vermont (Mr.  the  gentleman  from Massachusetts  (Mr.  the  gentleman  from  Massachusetts  (Mr. CAPUANO), and of course, the gentleman from Maine (Mr. BALDACCI). We  have  all  been  working  hard  because  our  constituents  hurt  very  hard this winter. We  saw  prices  in Rhode  Island  go  from  99  cents  a  gallon  to  over $2.05  a  gallon  in  a  matter  of  weeks. This  will  help  reverse  that  trend,  and this  will  be  better  for  the  constituents of  the  Northeast.  And  I  thank  my  colleagues for that. Mr. BOUCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from Vermont (Mr. SANDERS). Mr.  SANDERS. Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the  gentleman  for  yielding  me  the time. Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  gentleman from  Texas  (Chairman  the gentleman  from  Virginia  (Mr.  BOUthe  ranking  member,  the  gentleman  from  Massachusetts  (Mr.  MARKEY),  the  gentleman  from  Maine  (Mr. the  gentleman  from  Rhode Island  (Mr.  and  I  also  want to  thank  the  President  and  Secretary Richardson  for  their  support  of  the consent  of  a  Northeast  home  heating oil reserve. Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  no  secret  that  this winter  the  people  in  the  Northeast were  hit  very,  very  hard  by  the  large increase  in  home  heating  oil  prices; and  many  of  the  folks  in  the  State  of Vermont  in  the  Northeast  were  having a  very,  very  difficult  time  paying  a doubling  of  the  price  of  home  heating oil  from  just  1  year  before.  It was  a  serious  crisis.  It  remains  a  crisis.  And  it is  no  secret  that  we  were  not  prepared for it. On February 4, I introduced H.R. 3608, the  Home  Heating  Oil  Price  Stability Act;  and  in  this  short  period  of  time since  then,  we  now  have  98  cosponsors, including  24  Republicans  and  27  Representatives  who  are  not  from  the Northeast. So  this  is a bipartisan piece of  legislation.  It  is  a  national  piece  of legislation. WEYGAND),  BALDACCI),  BARTON),  CHER)  The  bottom  line  is  that  we  were caught  unprepared,  and  the  bottom line  is  that  we  have  got  not  to  be caught unprepared again. A home heating oil reserve of at least 2 million barrels,  and  that  is  the  legislation  included  within  this  bill,  would  make certain that when the weather becomes very cold, when home heating oil prices zoom  up,  we  will  have  something  to call  upon  to  control  the  escalating price  of  home  heating  oil.  And  that  is what  the  reserve  does.  So  I  think  this is a significant step forward in controlling escalating home heating oil prices. I  would  hope,  as  previous  speakers have  indicated,  that  we  could  expand the concept. Two million barrels  in the Northeast  is  a  good  start.  The  original legislation  calls  for  another  4.7 million barrels  in  the Gulf Coast, which  is part of  what  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve is. My  understanding  is  that  the  President  has  the  authority,  in  fact,  to  do that  on  his  own;  and  I  hope  that  he will. The  bottom  line  is  that  this  is  a  significant  step  forward  in  preventing  another  spike  in  home  heating  oil  in  the Northeast.  It  will  save  substantial sums  of  money  for  the  people  in  the Northeast  and,  in  fact,  for  people throughout this country. I  very much  thank  the  chairman  and the  ranking  member  and  those  who have made this legislation possible. Mr.  BOUCHER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself 30 seconds. Mr.  Speaker,  I  use  this  time  to  commend my friend and colleague, the gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  the chairman  of  our  energy  subcommittee, for his excellent work on  this measure. The  procedural  difficulties  that  I  referenced  earlier  were  not  of  his  doing.  I know  that,  given  his  way,  we  would have  had  a  different  process  and  one that I think would have been somewhat more thorough. I  urge  my  colleagues  to  approve  this measure.  It  will  reauthorize  the  authority  of  the President  to manage  the SPR. That is fundamentally important. I  would  encourage  all Members  to  support the legislation.

King  had,  indeed,  made  a  positive  difference. I  raised  the  question,  what  would southwest  Georgia  be  like  had  C.B. King  not  challenged  the  status  quo  in Federal  court  and  forced  desegregation of  the  public  schools  and  many  of  our south Georgia school systems. Had  he  not  gone  into  that  Federal courthouse  in  Albany,  Georgia,  would we  ever  have  seen  the  talent  of  a  Herschel  Walker,  the  talent  of  a  Charlie Ward,  or  the  talent  of  a  Judge  Herbert Phipps  who  now  sits  on  the  Georgia Court  of  Appeals,  or  a  Robert  Benham who  is  chief  justice  of  the  Georgia  Supreme Court. Had C.B. King not gone into Albany\u2019s Federal  court  to  force  the  City  of  Albany  to  comply  with  laws  prohibiting discrimination  in  employment  based on  race,  creed,  color,  religion,  or  sex under  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act of  1964,  Albany  and  many  south  Georgia municipalities  would  have  been  deprived  of  the  talents  of  countless  African  American  public  sector  employees, such as the current city manager in Albany  or  the  police  chief  or  the  fire chiefs,  and  many,  many,  many  others who  have  served  in  various  capacities in the public sector. This  was  a  milestone  in  the  history of  the  south.  It  was  a  milestone  in south  Georgia.  It  was  the  life  and  the efforts of C.B. King  that  really made  it possible. What  kind  of  justice  system  would we  have  in  southwest  Georgia  if  C.B. King  had  not  gone  into  our  Federal courthouse  to  end  the  age-old  practice of  excluding  blacks  and  women  from serving  on  juries  in  State  and  Federal cases? What  if  C.B. King  had  not  been  there to  have  our  Federal  courts  protect  the rights of citizens of all colors  to peaceably  assemble  and  petition  their  government,  to  be  free  of  discrimination and  voter  registration  in  the  voting booth and in running for office? Indeed,  I,  the  gentleman  from  Georgia  (Mr.  LEWIS),  the  gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the gentleman  from  North  Carolina  (Mr. WATT),  and  many  of  the  members  of the  Congressional  Black  Caucus  would not  be  here  serving  in  this  body,  and many thousands of others would not be serving  in  municipalities,  on  school board,  in  the  State  legislatures  all across the south had it not been for the work of C.B. King. I  have  been  joined  by  the  distinguished  gentleman  from  South  Carolina  (Mr.  another  of my  colleagues  who  was  a  part  of  the  movement, who  even  participated  in  the Albany  Movement,  who  knew  C.B.  King, and  who  has  gone  on  to,  in  the  legacy of  C.B.  King,  distinguish  himself.  He  is the  chairman  of  the  Congressional Black  Caucus.  He  perhaps,  as  well  as any,  knows,  feels,  experienced,  and  has lived the legacy of C.B. King. CLYBURN),  CLYBURN),  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  delighted  to  yield to  the  gentleman  from  South  Carolina (Mr.  my  friend  and  colleague. Mr.  CLYBURN. Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the  gentleman  from  Georgia  so  much for  yielding  me  a  few  moments  to speak  about  that  period  in  our  lives that tend to mold and make us what we are  today.  I  often  reflect  upon  my childhood  growing  up  in  South  Carolina. I  remember  when  I  was  but  a  teenager,  when  my  mother,  who  owned  a beauty  shop,  came  one  day  and  asked that  I  accompany  her  to  the  Sumter County,  South  Carolina  courtroom  because she wanted me to see some transformation  taking  place  in  our  State and Nation. When I went down that day, I had the great  honor  of  watching  in  utter amazement  a  great  South  Carolinian, Matthew  Perry,  who  was  arguing  a case  called  Nash  against  the  South Carolina  Conference  of  Branches  of NAACP. My  mother  wanted  me  to  see  Matthew  Perry  because  she  said  to  me  on that  day,  \u2018\u2018I  want  you  to  see  what  you can  be  if  you  stay  in  school,  study hard,  and  grow  up  to  live  out  your dreams.\u2019\u2019  I  always  held  that  day  with me  as  I  went  away  to  college  at  South Carolina State University. It  was  in  my  junior  year  that  I  was bitten  by  the  bug  that  we  all  call  the Student Movement. In the spring of my junior  year,  I  went  to  Raleigh,  North Carolina  where  I  joined  with  other black  students  from  all  over  the  country  in  trying  to  fashion  a  response  to what  had  just  taken  place  in  February of  that  year  at  North  Carolina  A&T University. That  following  fall, we all met  in Atlanta,  Georgia.  I  will  never  forget  the weekend,  October  13,  14  and  15  of  1960. It  was  that  weekend  that  I  met  the gentleman  from  Georgia  (Mr.  and  so  many  others.  There  we  were fashioning what later became known as the  Student  Nonviolent  Coordinating Committee.  Many  of  us  on  that  weekend  met  for  the  first  time  Martin  Luther King, Jr. It  was  in  discussions  that  took  place there  that  we  learned  at  his  knee.  I will never  forget  sitting up all night  in a  dormitory,  I  never  remember  the name  of  the  dormitory  there  at Moorehouse College, where we  sat with Martin Luther King,  Jr.  all  night  until 5:30,  6:00  a.m.  in  the  morning,  as  he tried  to  get  us  to  understand  his  nonviolent philosophy. It  was  from  there  that  many  of  us followed him to Albany and the now famous  Albany  Movement  where  I  first had  an  encounter,  and  I  did  not  know really  who  he  was  at  the  time,  I  now know,  and  of  course  I  have  known  for some time, that it was C.B. King. So  when  I  saw  that  the  gentleman from  Georgia  (Mr.  had  introduced  legislation to name a courthouse in  the  State  of  Georgia  in  honor  of  C. B.  King,  I  began  to  think  about  all  of that. BISHOP)  LEWIS), with  BISHOP)  time  in  our  lives,  I the  gentleman  from on  something that  period  in Of  course  those  of  us  in  South  Carolina,  we  always  looked  upon  what  was going  on  in  Atlanta  and  Georgia,  at those  guys  as  being  the  forerunners  in so  much  of  this.  But  I  teased  the  gentleman  from Georgia  (Mr. BISHOP)  over the  last  few  weeks  about  having  come here with him in 1993 and having vowed when  I  got  here  that  the  very  first thing  I was  going  to  do was  to  erect  in my own way a memorial  to that period in  my  life  that  meant  so  much  to  me and  now  my  children  and  grandchildren. I  did  that  by  introducing  as  my  first piece  of  legislation  a  bill  to  name  the new  courthouse  plan  for  Columbia, South  Carolina  in  honor  of Matthew  J. Perry. That bill is now law. We are getting  ready  to  break  ground  on  that courthouse,  and  that  courthouse  is going  to  be  named  for  Matthew  J. Perry. Now Matthew\u2019s name is going to go  on  the  courthouse  a  little  bit  later. C.B.  King\u2019s  name  will  go  on  the  courthouse in Georgia. But  for  the  first  got  out  in  front  of  Georgia  (Mr.  with  connection  our lives. But  it  is  important  to  him  to memorialize the life of C.B. King in this way, just  as  it  was  important  to  me  to  memorialize  the  life  of Matthew  J.  Perry. Because  in  that  period  of  our  history, we see a  lot going on today that people sort of take for granted. But  at  that  period,  in  1960,  1961,  1962, those  men  and  women  who  took  it upon  themselves  to  represent  us  as  we filled  up  the  jails  all  over  the  south, many  times  took  their  own  human safety into their hands. I  still  remember  another  attorney from  Columbia,  Boulware.  Boulware was  kind  of  interesting.  Boulware,  on one  instance,  I  think  it  was  Greenwood,  South  Carolina,  had  to  be  smuggled  out  of  town  in  the  trunk  of  his automobile. This  is  what  C.B.  King,  Matthew  J. Perry,  and  many  others  across  the south,  practicing  attorneys  had  to  endure  in  order  to  lay  the  groundwork that  eventually  led  to  many  of  the court  decisions  that  eventually brought  many  of  us  here  to  these  hallowed halls. So  to  be  here  this  evening  to  participate  in  this  special  order  is  something that  I  find  very,  very  satisfying  to me, because  it tends to bear out a  little admonition  that  my  mother  laid  on  me when  I  was  about  12  years  old  when  I was  saying  to  one  of  her  customers  in the  beauty  shop,  it  was  a  long-time family  friend,  what  I  wanted  to  be when  I  grow  up.  I  told  that  young  lady on that day about my dreams and aspirations  to be  involved  in  the body politic  of  South  Carolina  and  this  Nation. On  that  day,  that  lady  said  to  me, \u2018\u2018Son,  don\u2019t  you  ever  let  anybody  else hear you say that again.\u2019\u2019 On  that  evening,  my  mother  said  to me,  as  she  brought  me  to  the  kitchen table and told me not to pay any attention  to  what  I  had  been  told  in  the VerDate 20-MAR-2000 04:04 Apr 12, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00087 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K11AP7.206 pfrm02 PsN: H11PT1 ",
            "95": "April 11, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:69) H2109 them  out  there,  if  one  is  a  senior  in that  age  bracket  and  they  go  to  work, the  government,  after  they make more than  $17,000,  punishes  them  for  working. What? Yes. Let us repeat that. The government  says  if  seniors  want  to work  and  they  are  between  65  and  69 years  old,  we  are  only  going  to  allow them  to  make  $17,000  and  no  matter how  hard  they  work,  no  matter  how badly  they  need  seniors  to  fill  this  job, we  are  going  to  penalize  them  $1  for every  $3  they  make.  That  is  right,  we are  going  to  penalize  them  $1  for  every $3 that they make. How  can  something  like  that  come into  being?  Logically,  what  brought that  about?  What  happened  is  many, many  decades  ago  there  were  not enough  jobs.  Today  we  face  just  exactly  the  opposite  scenario;  there  are too  many  jobs.  I  guess  we  can  never have  too  many  jobs.  Let  us  say  there are  too  many  jobs  that  are  not  filled. Back  then,  there  were  not  enough  jobs so  once  again  Washington,  the  thinktank back here  in  the Potomac,  turned on the light and said, well, this is what we  will  do,  let  us  penalize,  let  us  force seniors, let us push them out of the job market. Let us get  those old  fogies,  let us move them out of there, by gosh. It  is  not  right,  but  that  is  what  happened. The  policy  adopted  just  like  the great  society  in  the  sixties,  which  was a  great  failure,  and  I  guess  we  cannot call  a  failure  great,  it  was  a  huge  failure,  this,  too,  has  become  a  huge  failure. Why would we push  senior citizens out of the labor market? Well,  under  Republican  leadership  I am  proud  to  say,  and  it  is  interesting to note,  that after all of  the years  that we  have  tried  to  get  this  done  and  we have had objections from the other side of  the  aisle,  from  the  Democrats,  it  is interesting  to  note  that  when  we  finally, when we finally put it up so that this  bill  could  face  the music, when we really  put  the  challenge  up  there  and the  vote  had  to  be  registered  on  this board  up  here,  I  think  that  left  the House  a week  or  so  ago unanimously.  I do not think there was a no vote in the Chamber. I do not think there was a no vote in the Chamber. What  does  it  do?  We  now  say  to  seniors  between  65  and  69  years  old,  guess what?  The  government  has  changed  its policy.  We  have  determined  that  it  is not  a  good  policy  to  punish  seniors  for staying  in  the  labor  market.  So  every one  of  us  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  can go  back,  but  I  have  to  say  while  I  say on  both  sides  of  the  aisle,  in  fairness when  my  colleagues  go  back  to  their constituents  they  ought  to  say  it  was Republican  leadership  that got  it done. Democrats  had  40  years  to  do  some  of these things: The house credit, the capital  gains  reduction,  the  death  tax,  the marriage  penalty  and  now  the  seniors. But  they  deserve  some  of  the  credit. After  all,  they  voted  for  it  when  it came up. We  did not have  any no  votes on the House Floor. The  fact  is  this:  Seniors,  800,000  of them between 65 and 69, they have good news  headed  their  way.  The  President is  going  to  sign  that  bill  and  they  are not  going  to  pay  taxes,  they  are  not going to be punished because they want to  work  in  the  labor  force.  In  fact,  we encourage  them  to  be  in  the  labor force.  I  think  it  makes  them  live longer.  I  think  it  is  great  for  them  and I  think  they  provide  a  terrific  asset  to our economy. Well,  let  me  move  from  all  of  these taxes.  The  reason  I  have  hit  taxes  in our  night  side  chat  this  evening  so  intensely  is  because  we  have  April  15 coming  up  but  it  is  time  for  a  new topic. AMERICA, THE ONLY SUPERPOWER WORLD IN THE Mr.  MCINNIS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  have had  an  opportunity  to  travel  fairly  extensively  throughout  the  world,  and there  are  a  few  things  I  want  to  talk about  regarding  the  United  States  of America,  Mr.  Speaker.  First  of  all,  we are  the  only  superpower  in  the  world, and  we  are  the  superpower  because  of American  ingenuity,  because  of  American  energy,  because  of  patriotism within our borders and  friendliness and strength  demonstrated  outside  of  our borders.  That  is  why  we  are  a  superpower. When  I  travel  in  the  world  I  carry  a little index card about a fourth the size of  this,  and  on  that  index  card  I  have an American flag; actually, a little picture of an American flag. When I travel to different countries, I make it a point of  getting  away  off  the  regular  path and  kind  of  going  down  an  unknown path. As they say, never walk the same path  twice.  I  go  down  an  alley  or  find a  merchant  and  show  them  that  index card. I have yet to find one person anywhere in the world that cannot identify the  flag  of  the  United  States  of  America. People  know  the  strength  of  the United  States  of  America,  but  it  did not  just  fall  out  of  the  skies.  Many  of our  European  colleagues  have  a  much, much longer history. Speaking from an industrial  aspect,  they  have  a  lot longer history. Most of the countries in the  world  are  much  older  than  our country  but  no  country  in  the  world even  comes  close  to  matching  our country.  Why?  Because  we  have  a  few principle  beliefs  that  we  push,  and  one of  them,  one  of  the  fundamental  ones, happens to be education. There are others. Health care, a strong military. One can  never  be  number  two  in  the  military.  The  stronger  one  is  in  the  military,  the  less  fights  they  are  going  to get  into.  Religion,  family,  we  could talk and on about those, but let us just go down to a couple of them. First  of  all,  let  me  say  that  also  in my travels throughout the world I have an  opportunity  not  because  of  but  because  of  the  position  as a  U.S.  Congressman,  I  have  an  opportunity  to  meet  people  in  other  countries  that  are  very wealthy.  I  have  had opportunities to meet kings and queens and  members  of  parliament  and  members  of  respected  governments  and MCINNIS SCOTT prime  ministers.  I  have  had  those  opportunities. To the best of my recollection,  when  I  have  asked  the  question, whenever  somebody  in  some  other country  other  than  the  United  States wants  to  send  their  kids  to  college,  a lot  of  the  time  they  send  those  kids  to be  educated  where?  In  the  United States of America. What  else?  When  those  families  have somebody  who  has  a  deadly  disease  or a  terrible  disease  like  cancer,  most  of those  wealthy  people,  what  their choice  is,  they  send  them  for  health care to the United States of America. Our  country  is  a  leader  in  health care.  We  are  number  one  in  the  world. Our country is number one in the world on  education.  Now,  sure,  we  have  test score  problems,  we  have  areas  we  have to  shore  up  on.  We  have  to  rededicate ourself  to  the  proposition  that  the most  important  person  in  the  classroom  is  the  student  and  that  the  resources  going  to  that  classroom  should be  focused  on  the  student,  not  on  all kinds  of  Federal  programs,  not  on  all kinds  of Federal  bureaucracies  that we find  in  the  Department  of  Education and  other  areas.  We  have  to  focus  on the  student. Education  is an  important issue  but  there  are  some  concerns  that I have out there. b 2130 One of the concerns that I have about education  in  our  country  is  discipline in  the  classroom.  Our  country,  again, another  fundamental  pillar  to  our  success,  is  that  we  exercise  and  we  expect individual responsibility; and that if an individual  did  not  carry  out  that  responsibility,  there  were  consequences. There were  consequences  for  their  lack of action. It is the same thing in the classroom. There  was  a  book,  and  for  the  life  of me,  I  cannot  think  of  the  title  of  it,  a lot  of  my  colleagues  out  here  will  remember  this  book,  I  cannot  remember, but  anyway  the  book  compared  the  10 most  serious  discipline  problems  30 years  ago  or  40  years  ago.  In  that  list, chewing  gum,  talking  out  loud  in  the classroom,  talking  out  of  turn,  not  answering  the  teacher  \u2018\u2018yes,  ma\u2019am\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018yes,  sir\u2019\u2019.  It  was  those  kind  of  things. I  remember  that.  That  is  what  I  used to get in trouble for. Then  it  talked  about  the  10  most common  discipline  problems  in  today\u2019s classroom.  I  will  tell  my  colleagues,  I think one can draw a coalition between chewing  gum  and  drugs.  I  think  one can  look  in  there  and  see  that  the  government,  not  the  teachers,  the  teachers,  in  my  opinion,  for  the  most  part, have done a commendable job. Unfortunately,  we  keep  bad  teachers,  and  we are  not  rewarding  the  good  teachers  in my  opinion.  But  if  one  drew  a  line,  I think  one  can  draw  a  direct  coalition between  the  discipline,  between  the fact  that  our  society,  our  government all  of  a  sudden  is  starting  to  say,  look, we should not have consequences.

The  601 children\u2019s  names  and  faces  are  different  but  each  case  and  story  is  the same.  One  would  think  that  9  years later,  with  hundreds  of  suspects  arrested,  countless  doors  kicked  in  and the  writing  of  thousands  of  reports that I would grow callous, but upon entering  the  bad  guy\u2019s  house  again  and seeing  those  small,  round,  innocent eyes  looking up at me,  finally  someone came  to  save  me,  I  turn  a  marshmallow.  I  do  not  have  to  make  up  stories  or  use  the  same  photographs  or tell the worst of the worst. They are all bad. Her  testimony  went  on,  and  let  me describe  this,  if  I may,  the  yard  is  covered  with  garbage,  old  bicycles,  toys and rusted car parts. Three or four dogs run under the house or aggressively approach. Inside the house it is dark with no  electricity.  The  stench  of  rotten food,  animal  urine  and  feces  and  soiled diapers  permeate  the  house.  Chemical odors  irritate  my  eyes  and  nose.  We fumble  down  hallways  into  bedrooms stepping  on  filthy  clothing  and  debris. The  children  are  startled when  a  flashlight  shines  in  their  way.  They  are sleeping  on  soiled  mattresses  with  no sheets  or  blankets.  They  sleep  in clothes for the third day in a row. They have not had a bath in days and cannot remember  when  they  last  ate.  They rarely attend school due to lice infestation  and  cockroaches  have  become their  pets.  The  soiled  food  stored  in  an ice  chest  is moldy. There  is no  running water  and  the  methamphetamine  laboratory  is  all  over  the  kitchen.  The children  draw  pictures  for  me  of mommy with a methamphetamine pipe and show me bruises where mom\u2019s boyfriend  hit  them.  The  oldest  child  comforts  the  younger  sibling  as  obviously trying  to  parent.  None  of  the  kids  cry or,  for  that  matter,  show  any  emotion at all. They all exhibit a classic attachment disorder. Domestic violence is obvious  with  the  holes  kicked  in  the doors and the walls. A loaded firearm is found  next  to  the  couch  and  another under  the  bed,  both  where  children have access. Again  she  goes  on,  a  description  of what she sees in this house and it is unfortunately  very  typical.  She  told  us that she saw these scenes over and over and over again. She  said  these children were  lucky.  We  rescued  them  before they were injured, maimed or killed. The  newspaper  clippings  I  collected from  all  over  the  State  and  even  a  few other  States  tell  more  horrific  stories. These  are  some  of  the  clippings  that she  provided  our  subcommittee  and stories:  Fifteen  month  overdoses  on methamphetamine;  five  month  old tests  positive  for  methamphetamine and succumbs to death with 12 rib fractures,  a  burned  leg  and  scarred  feet  by a  methamphetamine  addict  in  Los  Angeles;  13  month  old  dies  of  heart  trauma,  broken  spine  and  neck  by  methamphetamine  addict.  She  was  also raped and sodomized. Twenty-five  month  old  Oregon  toddler  overdoses  on methamphetamine;  a 2  year  old  dies  with methamphetamine in the system, San Jose, California; a 2 year old eats methamphetamine from a baby  food  jar  in  Twenty-Nine  Palms, California; a 14 month old drinks lye in water  from  a  parent\u2019s  methamphetamine  laboratory,  hospitalized  permanently  with  severe  organ  damage;  new baby  dies  from  mother  breast  milk laced  with  methamphetamine  in  Orange  County;  8  week  old,  11  pound  boy dies  from  methamphetamine  poisoning found  inside  baby  bottle  in  Orange County;  an  8  year  old  watches  and hears  mom  die  in  a  methamphetamine laboratory  in  Oroville,  California;  a  6 month  old  overdoses  semi-comatose seizuring,  hospitalized,  drank  methamphetamine,  also  in  Oroville,  California;  a  4  year  old  tests  positive  for methamphetamine,  beaten  and  hair pulled  out  by  mom  and  boyfriend, Chico, California;  8  children  exposed  to methamphetamine  laboratory  in  day care  center  in  southern  California;  and mom on methamphetamine and her addicted  boyfriend  drown  a  2  year  old  in a bathtub in Sacramento. This  is  just  a  sampling  of  the  death, destruction  and mayhem  that  was  provided  to  us  by  this  one  witness  from one county in California. Most people do not know much about methamphetamines,  and  the  addiction and epidemic is limited at this point to the  Midwest  and  to  the  far  West,  but spreading  across  the  country.  We  had Dr.  Leshner,  who  is  head  of  NIDA,  National  Institute  of  Drug  Abuse,  come and  testify  before  our  subcommittee and  give  us  the  latest  information  on what  methamphetamines  do  to  people. Most people who are involved in taking methamphetamine  really  do  not  know that they are setting themselves up  for brain  damage  and  destruction.  We found  also  that  the  damage  that  is done  to  the  brain  causes  such  bizarre behavior  that  parents  abandon  their children. In  California,  we  were  told  where they  attempted  to  return  35  of  these children  to  their  parents,  only  5  parents  were  capable  or  willing,  after being  on  methamphetamines,  to  take their  children  back.  We  were  told  of one  parent  on  methamphetamine  who tortured  their  child  and  then  finished the  child  off  by  boiling  the  child  alive. This  is  the  type  of  bizarre  behavior that methamphetamine produces in the brain  in  individuals  who  take  methamphetamine. This  is  the  scientific  data  that  Dr. Leshner  provided  our  subcommittee. This first slice of brain and this view of the brain shows dopamine, with normal dopamine  levels  that  are  required  for an  active,  healthy  brain.  The  second and  third  illustration  here  is  a  gradual reduction  in  dopamine  levels  in  the brain  due  to  methamphetamine  uses. The  fourth  illustration  here  that  has been  provided  is  a  brain  from  an  individual  who  suffers  from  Parkinson\u2019s disease,  and  we  can  see  the  deterioration  of  methamphetamine  from  a  normal  brain  into  various  stages  of  methamphetamine,  the  most  severe  stage, this happens to be Parkinson\u2019s but also mirrors  methamphetamine.  So  this  is what  this  wonderful  drug  has  done  for one  county  in  California,  what  it  can do  for  an  individual,  and  again  the damage  that  can  be  imposed  on  individuals.  It  really  is  shocking  and  I  do not  think  most  people  who  get  hooked on  methamphetamines  have  any  idea what  they  are  doing  to  themselves  or the  potential  damage  they  can  do  to their family or their children. The  cases  we  have  are  just  able. unbelievb 2300 Again,  I  do  not  want  to  go  into  any more  of  them  tonight,  but  I  will  be glad  to  provide  Members  upon  request additional  information  on  what  our subcommittee  has  found  relating  to methamphetamine  and  its  horrible  impact. The other  chart  that  I  showed  is heroin.  I  showed  how  heroin  has  now caused tremendous problems across the United  States.  We  have  a  heroin  epidemic  in  many  regions  of  the  country, including  the  area  that  I  represent, which  is  central  Florida.  Heroin  use and abuse is up dramatically. Heroin  is  not  the  heroin  of  the  1960s, 1970s, or even 1980s. The purity in those days  was  in  the  low  percentile,  single digits,  a  9  percent  pure.  The  heroin that  we  are  getting  in  from  South America and Mexico  is now  running  70, 80  percent  pure.  That  is  why  we  have an  incredible  death  rate  in  Central Florida and around the country. Young  people  and  others  are  taking heroin.  They  are  mixing  it  with  some other  substance,  alcohol  or  some  other drug.  Or  even  first-time  users  are  hit with  this  high  70  percent  pure  heroin, go into convulsions, and die. Now, I think that many people would believe  that  heroin  has  been  glorified by Hollywood, and heroin is the type of drug  that  the  stars  and  others  in  important  places  use.  Most  people  do  not realize  the  severe  consequence  of  heroin. Unfortunately,  I  am  one  Representative  that  has  heard  more  about  the tragedy of heroin than many of my colleagues.  As  I  said,  in  Central  Florida, our  heroin  overdose  deaths,  particularly  among  our  young  people,  now  exceed our rate of homicides. One  of  the  parents  provided  me  with the  permission  to  show  the  effects  of heroin. This  is particularly a gruesome depiction  of  the  end  of  the  life  of  this constituent\u2019s  death,  a  young  man  in Central  Florida.  This  is  how  the  coroner  placed  the  body  before  the  body was removed. Now, again,  I know young people and many  people  across  this  land  think that  heroin  use  is  somewhat  glamorous.  The  picture  I  am  about  to  show is  her  son  as  the  coroner  found  him  in Orlando,  a  rather  gruesome  picture.  I show  it  only  to  show  what  the  potential  holds  for  using  this  high  purity VerDate 20-MAR-2000 04:04 Apr 12, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00103 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K11AP7.236 pfrm02 PsN: H11PT1 ",
            "111": "S2484  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE April 11, 2000  semiautomatic  pistol,  pointed  it  at  his  classmates, and then turned the gun on  Kayla  Rolland,  6  years  old,  and  fatally  shot her in the neck.  This  sad  reality  is  on  the  minds  of  American  families.  The  obvious  question  of  the  Senate  and  the  Congress  is:  Is there anything you can do? What can  you do? What will you do?  The  first  anniversary  of  Columbine  will  come  and  go  next  week,  and  sadly  Congress will have done nothing\u2014absolutely nothing.  We passed a bill last year on the floor  of  the  Senate  which  at  least  moved  us  closer  to  the  possibility  of  keeping  guns  out  of  the  hands  of  criminals  and  children.  There  was  an  idea  behind  this  law  that  was  not  an  unreasonable  or  radical  idea,  which  was  the  suggestion  that  if  a  person  bought  a  gun  at  a  gun  show,  that  person  would  be  subject  to  the  same  background  checks  as  a  person  who  bought  one  from  a  licensed  gun  dealer.  We  don\u2019t  want  to  sell  guns  to  criminals.  We  don\u2019t  want  to  sell  them  to  people  with  a  history  of  violent  mental  illness.  We  certainly  don\u2019t  want  to  sell  guns  to  children.  Why  wouldn\u2019t  we  check  at  a  gun  show  to  make certain  that we are keeping guns  away  from  those  people?  That  is  what  the law said. That was what was passed  here in the Senate.  The  background  check  has  become  automated  and  computerized.  Within  2  hours  after  the  name  is  submitted,  some 95 percent of all of the names submitted\u2014they  run  them  through\u201495  percent  of  the  people who  buy  a  gun  at  a  gun  show  would  be  delayed  2  hours  from  buying  a  gun.  For  the  5  percent  where  questions  are  raised  and  they  can\u2019t  give  them  an  immediate  answer,  that  5  percent  is  20  times  more  likely  to  be  in  a  prohibited  category;  that  is,  they  are  20  times  more  likely  to  be  criminals,  people with  a history  of  violent  mental  illness,  or  those  who  should otherwise be disqualified.  The  law  we  proposed  was  not  a  radical  idea.  It  said:  Can  you  wait  2  hours  at  a  gun  show  so  we  can  do  a  background  check  and  make  sure  that  people who should not buy guns, don\u2019t buy  them?  It  is  an  inconvenience.  But  you  know,  we  put  up  with  inconvenience  every  day  for  the  security  of  ourselves  and our families.  When  I  flew  through  O\u2019Hare  Airport  yesterday  to  come  to  Washington,  I  went  through  a  metal  detector.  They  stopped  me:  Take  the  change  out  of  your  pockets  and  go  back  through.  That  is  an  inconvenience.  That  is  a  delay.  I  am  prepared  to  accept  that.  If  it  means  there  will  be  fewer  terrorist  attacks  and  fewer  threats  on  people  traveling, I accept it.  That  is  what  this  law  says;  it  is  an  inconvenience. At  a  gun  show, wait  for  the  background  check  to  be  completed  before you are allowed to get your gun.  That is what we proposed.  Second,  we  said  if  you  are  going  to  own  a  gun,  you  have  a  legal  responsibility  to  store  it  safely.  You  exercise  your  constitutional  right  under  the  second  amendment  to  buy  a  gun,  but  then  when  you  take  it  home,  for  goodness\u2019  sake, put  it  in a place  so children  can\u2019t get their hands on it.  We  called  for  trigger  locks,  and  that  is becoming a popular, common suggestion\u2014it  is  not  an  unreasonable  suggestion,  certainly\u2014so  children  don\u2019t  get  their  hands  on  guns.  Every  day  in  America,  we  lose  just  as  many  kids  to  guns  as  we  lost  on  April  20,  1999,  at  that  one  high  school  in  Colorado\u201412  kids  a  day  die  because  of  guns.  Some  are  suicides,  some  are  drive-by  gangbanger  shootings,  and  others  are  just  accidents  where  curious  kids  play  with  guns  and  shoot  themselves  or  their playmates.  Our  bill  said  let\u2019s  require  trigger  locks on guns,  let\u2019s make sure they are  stored  safely  and  the kids,  such  as  this  fellow  in Michigan,  do  not  end  up  with  a  .32-caliber Davis industries semiautomatic pistol in the first grade where he  killed  Kayla  Rowland.  That  was  the  second part of this bill.  The  third  part  said  you  don\u2019t  need  these  high-capacity  Ammo  clips  with  hundreds  of  bullets  in  them  if  you  are  going  out  to  shoot  a  deer.  If  you  need  a  semiautomatic  weapon  to  shoot  a  deer, maybe you ought to stick to  fishing.  We  are  saying  we  don\u2019t  need  to  make  these  clips  in  the  United  States  nor  do  we  need  to  import  them.  These  are  people  killers.  These  are  not  guns  used in sporting or hunting enterprises.  That was the third part of the bill.  We  almost  lost  the  gun  shows  provision  I  have  just  described  on  the  Senate  floor.  The  gun  shows  amendment  passed  by  one  vote,  the  vote  of  Vice  President  GORE,  who  under  the  Constitution can break a tie. He showed up  that day and cast the deciding vote. We  passed  the  gun  shows  amendment  by  one vote after Columbine, after this national  tragedy.  We  passed  it  by  one  vote. We  sent  it  across  the  Rotunda  to  the House of Representatives. Now it is  their  responsibility. We  gave  them  2  or  3  weeks  to  prepare  to  debate  the  bill.  But we obviously gave the gun lobby at  least  the  same  period  of  time  to  prepare  their  campaign  against  it.  And  they  were  successful.  They  watered  down  the  gun  shows  amendment.  They  took  the  viable  parts  out  of  it.  They  passed  a  shadow  of  what  we  passed  in  the Senate.  At  that  point,  it  goes  to  the  conference  committee  and  the  House  and  Senate sit together and try to work out  a  compromise.  Here  we  sit,  almost  a  year  after  Columbine,  and  we  have  done  absolutely  nothing.  Families  across  America  who  expect  this  Congress  to  do  the  most  basic  things  for  gun  safety  have  a  right  to  be  angry  that  this Congress  is  so  insensitive and  unwilling  to  address  this  critical  issue  of  gun  safety,  of  safety  in  the  classrooms,  keeping  guns  out  of  the  hands  of  criminals,  violently  mental  ill  people, and children.  The other side says, of course, it isn\u2019t  about new  laws. We hear  the gun  lobby  say  we  have  plenty  of  laws,  it  is  about  enforcing  the  laws  on  the  books.  How  many  times  have  we  heard  Charlton  Heston  and  those  folks  come  up  with  that  argument?  I  don\u2019t  disagree  with  them.  I  think  enforcement  is  critical  and existing laws should be enforced.  So  last  week  while  we  were  debating  the  budget  resolution,  I  brought  a  proposal  on  the  floor  of  the  Senate.  Many  Members,  frankly,  subscribe  to  the  NRA  position  that  we  need  more  enforcement.  I  said  let\u2019s  put more  agents  and  inspectors  in  the  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and  Firearms  so  they  can  find  the  gun  dealers  who  are  breaking  the law and selling their guns to criminals;  let\u2019s  put  1,000  more  prosecutors  across  America  to  enforce  those  laws,  prosecute those  laws, and put people  in  jail who violate those laws.  Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t succeed and  I  didn\u2019t  prevail. A Senator  came  to  the  floor  and  offered  an  alternative  which  took  out  all  the  money  for  the  ATF  agents  and  inspectors.  He  didn\u2019t  want  to  put  more  enforcement  in  the  gun  laws of America. And he prevailed. The  argument  that  this  is  about  enforcement doesn\u2019t  square with  the vote  that  took place last week.  There  are  102,000  gun  dealers  across  America,  about  80,000 who  actively  sell  weapons  that  are  used  in  sport  and  hunting.  When  we  did  a  survey,  out  of  those 80,000 federally licensed gun dealers, we found if we narrowed it down to  those  gun  dealers  who  sell  guns  that  end  up  being  used  in  crime,  traceable  guns  used  in  crime,  only  1,000  of  the  80,000  gun  dealers  are  the  culprits,  the  ones  selling  guns  to  people  that  are ultimately  used  in  crime.  Over  half  the  guns  used  in  crime  in  America  come  from  1,000  of  the  gun  dealers  out  of  80,000.  It  makes  sense  to  me  to  go  after  these 1,000, and it makes sense to me to  give  resources  to  the  ATF  and  the  Department  of  the  Treasury  to  go  after  these  gun  dealers,  close  them  down  if  we  have  to,  but  enforce  the  law.  Don\u2019t  let  people\u2014whether  they  are  in  Illinois,  my  home  State,  or  any  other  State\u2014sell  guns  that  are  going  to  be  used in a crime.  When  I  put  the  amendment  on  the  floor,  the  other  side  couldn\u2019t  accept  that. They didn\u2019t want  to put more  enforcement  in  the  gun  laws.  So  they  came  up  with  a  much  weaker  alternative.  Here  we  are  at  the  traditional  and  historic  standoff.  This  Congress  failed  to  act  for  1  year  after  Columbine.  The  images  are  still  fresh  in  our  mind  of  those kids running for their lives out of  their  own  high  school;  those  caskets,  one  after  the  other,  at  funerals;  grieving parents, grieving communities, and  a  grieving  nation;  and  this  Congress,  unable and unwilling to respond or act.  It  is  shameful.  It  is  disgraceful.  And  it  continues. The school violence, the gun  violence  that  struck  Columbine,  continues.  Look  beyond  the  schools.  We  see  it  in  the  streets  and  the  neighborhoods, and more children will die today  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:13 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S11AP0.REC S11AP0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",

And  following that, then\u2014\u2014  Mr.  WARNER.  I  would  like  to  speak  on  the  gas  issue  in  sequence  after  the  Senator  from  West  Virginia,  if  I  may.  We want to stay on the issue, I suggest,  because  we  have  a  vote.  Then  we  wish  to accommodate other Senators.  Mr.  MURKOWSKI.  If  I  may,  we  have  other  speakers  who  want  to  speak  on  our side on the gas tax  issue, so we can  follow back and forth.  Mrs. HUTCHISON.  If  I can get an understanding,  then  it  will  be  Senator  under  Senator  BYRD\u2019s  time,  myself  under  Senator  MURtime,  then  back  to  Senator  BYRD\u2014and  Senator  for  however  they  are  going  to  allocate  their  time  under  Senator  BYRD\u2019s  time  allotment?

But  the  lady\u2019s  proposal  is  going  to  automatically  say  she  is  going to be next after Mr. VOINOVICH. Is  that the way she wants it done?  Mrs.  HUTCHISON.  It  was  my  understanding  we  would  go  back  and  forth,  according  to  the  time  allotments.  Senator  is  on  the  time  of  the  Senator  from  West  Virginia.  I  thought  the  sequence would  be  back  to  Senator  MURKOWSKI\u2019s side after that.  If  that  is  not  correct,  I will  be  happy  to  yield  whatever  time  Senator  wants  on  his  side,  and  then  I  will  control  Senator  time  after  Senator  Senator  BYRD,  and  Senator WARNER. Is that what the Senator  from  West  Virginia  is  suggesting?  It  is  fine,  as  long  as  I  know  at  what  point  our  side  will  be  able  to  reclaim  our time.  Mr. BYRD. Any way  is  fine. The Senator  from Alaska  had  a  lot  of  time. He  spoke  a  long  time.  I  sat  here  a  long  time.  I  was  glad  to  listen  to  it.  Mr.  was  here  before  I  came.  He  should have his time.  Mrs.  HUTCHISON.  If  the  Senator  from  West  Virginia  wants  to  take  all  three  from  his  side  in  answer  to  Senator  I  will  be  happy  to  do  that.  Then  will  take  my  time  after  Senator  Senator  BYRD,  and  Senator  Is  that  to  what  the  Senator  West  Virginia  was  referring?  Mr.  BYRD.  Senator.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.

Will  the  Senator  from  Texas  restate  the  unanimous consent request?  Mrs.  HUTCHISON.  Mr.  President,  I  will make an attempt.

Mr.  President,  I  thank  Senator  for yielding time.  I  speak  against  the  repeal  of  the  4.3-  cent-a-gallon gas tax for the third time  on  the  floor  of  the  Senate.  Although  I  disagree  with  my  colleague  from  Alaska  in  regard  to  this matter,  I  do  agree  this debate has given us an opportunity  to  identify  the  real  problem  of  why  we  have  high  gas  prices  in  this  country,  and  that  is,  we  lack  an  energy  policy.  Our  reliance  on  foreign  oil  could  increase  to  65  percent  or  more  by  the  year 2020.  As a matter of fact, a couple of weeks  ago in the Committee on Governmental  Affairs,  we  had  a  representative  from  the  Energy  Department  appear  before  the  committee  and  I  asked  him:  Just  how  reliant  should  we  be  on  foreign  oil?  What  is  the  number?  He  was  unable to give a number.  I  mentioned  that,  as  a  former  Governor,  if  I  had  a  problem,  I would  identify  what  the  goal  was  to  solve  that  problem  and  put  in  place  strategies  to  achieve  that  goal.  The  fact  is,  we  are  here  today  because  we  have  no  energy  policy  in  this  country.  That  is  the  main issue.  The  other  issue  is  whether  or  not  reducing the gas tax by 4.3 cents a gallon  is  going  to  make  any  real  difference.  I  argue  it  may  not  bring  down  the  price  of  gas  at  the  pump.  In  some  States,  if  the gas tax  is reduced, their State  laws  provide  that  the  state  gas  tax  is  increased  to  make  up  for  the  loss  of  the  Federal  gas  tax.  I  point  out  that  in  terms  of  the  traveling  public,  the  motoring public, getting rid of the 4.3 cent  is  to  $43  save  only  going  about  gas  tax  a year.  This  is  one  of  the  factors  which  I  think  adds  to  the  cynicism  of  the  American  public  in  regard  to  some  of  the  things  we  do  in  the  Senate.  We  argue  this  is  going  to  make  a  difference,  and  then  the  people  realize  all  we  are  talking  about  over  a  year\u2019s  period,  if  they  drive  15,000  miles  a  year,  at 15 miles-per-gallon is about $43.  I  have  been  involved  in  this  matter  as  a Governor  and  as  the  former  chairman  of  the  National  Governors\u2019  Association. The Governors were opposed to  the  4.3-cent-a-gallon  gas  tax  in  1993  because  it  was  used  for  deficit  reduction  and  we  thought  it  should  be  used  for  building highways.  In  1998, when TEA\u201321 was  negotiated,  everyone  agreed  to  put  that  4.3  cents  a  gallon  into  the  highway  trust  fund  so  we  can  use  it  for  new  construction  of  highways  and  to  maintain  and  repair  highways.  It  also  guaranteed  to  many  of  the  donor  States\u2014that  is,  a  State  that  sends  more  money  to  Washington  than  they  get  back,  like  Ohio\u2014that  they will get at least 90.5 cents per dollar  back  every  year.  It  gave  us  a  predictable,  reliable  source  of  revenue  to  get  the  job  done.  We  thought  we  had  resolved this issue once and for all.  Today  we  have  the  issue  before  us  of  reducing  the  gas  tax  by  4.3  cents  a  gallon. Someone  said: Do  not worry  about  it  because  we  will  make  up  the  lost  funding  from  the  surplus.  I  argue,  if  I  have  listened  carefully  to  my  colleagues  on  the  floor,  there  are  lots  of  other good  things  that  they want  to do  with  our  surplus.  If  one  looks  at  it  from an equity point of view, the tradition  in  this  country  is,  the  people  who  use  the  highways  pay  for  them. We  are  saying  reduce  their  tax and make  it up  by  hitting  everybody  else  in  the  country  and  taking  it  out  of  the  general  fund,  which  can  be  used  for  other  things  that  would  benefit  the  rest  of  America.  I  cannot  buy  the  argument:  Do  not  worry  about  it,  we  will  make  it  up  from the surplus.  I  also  point  out  the  National  Governors\u2019  Association,  the  National  League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of  Mayors,  the  National  Association  of  Counties,  all  the major State  and  local  organizations  are  opposed  to  repealing  the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax.  I  do  not  care  what  the  polls  say,  the  one  organization  I  listen  to  in  Ohio  which  represents  the  motoring  public  is  the  American  Automobile  Association.  This  is  the  premier  organization  representing  the  people  who  drive  in  this country.  One  would  think  they  would  be  for  reducing  the  gas  tax,  wouldn\u2019t  they?  The  fact  is,  they  are  opposed  to  it  because  they know  that  repair  and maintenance  of  our  highways  and  new  construction  are  important  to  the  motoring  public,  particularly  to  their  safety.  They  also  realize  that  this  country,  in  so many areas, has turned into a gigantic  parking  lot,  with  gridlock,  bottlenecks, and hours wasted  in America on  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:13 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S11AP0.REC S11AP0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",
            "127": "S2500  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE April 11, 2000  Just  last  week,  DOE\u2019s  Energy  Information  Administration  stated  that,  \u2018\u2018. . .  motor  gasoline  markets  are  projected  to  exhibit  an  extraordinarily  tight  supply/demand  balance.\u2019\u2019  Against  this  backdrop,  we  cannot  depend  upon  the  Administration\u2019s  predictions  turning  into  fact,  when  they  have  so  far  been so incorrect.  Now  is  the  time  for  Congress  to  act,  even  if the Administration refuses to.  I  want  to  at  least make  sure  that American  businesspeople  and  consumers  have  in  their  pockets  what  they  would  have  otherwise  paid  in  fuel  taxes  if  the  Administration  is  underestimating  prices  once  again  and  gasoline  hits  $2.00 a gallon.  Beyond the pump, consumers are getting  hit  with  extra  costs  directly  attributable  to  high  fuel  costs.  If  you\u2019ve  paid to send an overnight package lately,  you  probably  noted  that  you  were  charged  a  surcharge\u2014a  fuel  fee\u2014because  their  cost  of  diesel  fuel  has  increased  by  about  60  percent  over  the  past  year.  And  with  a  150  percent  increase  in  jet  fuel,  that  airline  ticket  you  buy  today  will  probably  include  something  you\u2019ve  never  seen  before\u2014a  fuel  charge  of  $20.00.  How  long  will  it  be  before  costs  of  other  products  will  also be passed on the consumer?  Consider  the  impacts  to  the  nations\u2019  farmers.  In  some  locations,  the  planting  season  has  begun.  The  New  York  Times  reported  two  weeks  ago  that  a  farmer  paying  40  cents  a  gallon  more  this year to  fuel his diesel tractors and  combines,  will  be  adding  as  much  as  $240  a  day  to  his  harvesting  costs.  In  my home State of Maine, we are at the  peak  season  for  moving  last  year\u2019s  potato  crop  out  of  storage  and  to  the  large  Eastern  markets.  But  the  industry  still  can\u2019t  get  truckers  to  come  into the State to move the potatoes because  they  are  discouraged  by  the  particularly  higher  price  of  diesel  in  Maine.  The  only  help  the  potato  industry  has  had  recently  in  getting  their  product to market was certainly not due  to  the  energy  policy  of  this  Administration,  but  to  local  truckers  who  turned  to hauling potatoes because wet weather kept  them  away  from  taking  timber  out of the Maine woods.  Soon,  we  will  enter  the  summer  months,  when  tourism  is  particularly  important  to  the  economy of New England  and  to  Maine  in  particular.  With  the  high  price  of  gasoline,  we  need  relief  now,  and  that\u2019s  what  this  bill  provides.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  we  could  have  used  the  relief  in Northern Maine  a  few  months  ago\u2014that\u2019s  a  big  tourist  season  for  them  as  snowmobilers  from  all  over  the  East  head  to  Maine  to  use  the hundreds of miles of trails throughout the northern part of the State.  The choices are clear\u2014do nothing  for  the  taxpayers who  are  being  gouged  by  failed  energy  policies,  or  do  something  by  supporting  legislation  that  gives  some  relief  at  the  gas  pump  right  now.  We  should  temporarily  repeal  the  4.3  cent  per  gallon  gas  tax  and  support  a  on  rerelieve  the  pressure  to  boost  supply  and  bill  that  also  acts  as  a  circuit  breaker,  giving citizens a break at the gas pump  if gas goes over $2.00 a gallon while protecting  the  Trust  Funds  that  build  our  highways  and  airports.  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  this  bill  by  voting  for cloture.  Mrs.  FEINSTEIN.  Mr.  President,  I  am  as  upset  by  the  gasoline  price  spikes  as  anyone  else.  Price  spikes  have  been  worse  in  California  than  in  any  other  State.  Today,  as  I  speak,  though  prices  have  recently  started  to  come  down  a  bit,  they  still  average  more  than  $2  per  gallon  in  some  parts  of California.  Having said that, I feel obliged to oppose  S.  2285,  despite  understanding  the  sentiment  behind  it.  The  problem  with  S.  2285  is  that  there  is  no  way  to  guarantee  that  a  reduction  in  the  federal  gasoline  tax  will  be  passed  on  to  consumers. Why  is  this? Because price  is a  function  of  supply  and  demand,  not  taxes.  And  right  now,  world  oil  markets  are  extremely  tight,  so  prices  are  high.  The  way  to  the  market  is  duce demand.  With  regard  to  supply,  fourteen  nations  sell  oil  to  the U.S.  under  a  cartel  known  as  the  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries,  OPEC.  Like  any monopoly, OPEC controls the price  of  oil  by  limiting  supply.  Decreased  production  in  non-OPEC  countries  like  Venezuela,  Mexico,  and  Norway  has  also contributed to the squeeze.  Since OPEC is not bound by U.S. law,  there  are  only  a  few  things  the  U.S.  can  do  to  encourage  the  cartel  to  increase  supply.  The  preferred  alternative  is  diplomacy.  Energy  Secretary  Bill  Richardson  has  had  some  success  on  this  front.  OPEC  ministers  announced  last  month  that  the  cartel  would  immediately  increase  supply  by  1.7  million  barrels  a  day.  Mexico  has  also agreed to  increase production by a  small amount.  It  takes  several weeks  for production  increases  to  be  felt  at  the  pump,  in  lower prices. And California has unique  problems  affecting  its  supply. No  other  State requires the kind of reformulated  gasoline  that  California  does.  So  the  gasoline has to be refined in California.  And  California  refiners  have  had  problems\u2014including  two  fires\u2014operating  their  plants  at  full  capacity.  They  are  at full capacity now.  Notwithstanding  these  problems,  the  announcement  of  OPEC  production  increases  has  driven  spot  gasoline  prices  down.  They  have  dropped more  than  40  cents,  for  instance,  in  the  greater  Los  Angeles area.  The spot price is the price of gasoline  on  the  open  market  without  taxes  and  other  markups  figured  in.  Spot  prices  are  usually  good  harbingers  of  the  price movement  we  will  eventually  see  at  the  pump  about  a  month  or  two  later.  But  the  increase  in  OPEC  production  is,  at  best,  a  short-term  solution.  By  the middle of summer when demand for  be  back  in  may  gasoline  will  peak,  we  the same predicament.  As  I  said  a  moment  ago,  S.  2285  doesn\u2019t  solve  the  problem  of high  gasoline prices. Under California  law,  if  the  federal  gasoline  tax  drops  by  9  cents  per  gallon  or  more,  then  the  State  tax  automatically  rises  to  off-set  the  federal  decrease.  The  law  is  designed  to  protect  the  Highway  Trust  Fund.  I  have  spoken with members  of  the California  legislature  about  this.  They  do  not seem inclined to change the law.  Even  if  the  law  were  changed,  the  price  still  wouldn\u2019t  drop.  At  least  that\u2019s what  the  chief  executive  officers  of  the  three  major  California  refiners  told  me.  Collectively,  they  produce  70  percent  of  California\u2019s  gasoline.  None  could guarantee  that prices would drop  at  the  pump.  They  cited  the  fundamental  problem  with  supply,  and  also  pointed  out  that  they  have  no  control  over other entities  in the supply chain.  What are our options?  The  fact  is,  we  have  limited  control  over  supply.  Too  much  of  the  world\u2019s  oil  is  produced  elsewhere.  The  one  thing we can control is demand.  The  best  way  to  reduce  demand  is  to  require  that  sports  utility  vehicles  (SUVs)  and  light  duty  trucks  get  the  same  fuel  efficiency  that  passenger  vehicles  do.  If  SUVs  and  light  duty  trucks  had  the  same  fuel  efficiency  standards  as  passenger  cars,  the  U.S.  would  use  one  million  fewer  barrels  of  oil each day.  This  is  roughly  equal  to  the  shortfall  before  OPEC  increased  duction.  The Department  of Transportation  is  responsible  for  setting  fuel  efficiency  requirements  under  the  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy  (CAFE\u00b4 )  program.  Abut  two-thirds  of  all  petroleum  used  goes to transportation, so boosting fuel  efficiency  is an  important way  to wean  ourselves  off  OPEC  oil  and  reduce  the  price  motorists  pay  for  gasoline.  Consider,  too,  the  significant  environmental  and  health  benefits  of  higher  fuel efficiency.  But  CAFE\u00b4 standards  have  not  increased  since  the  mid-  1980s.  And  the  situation  is  made  worse  by  a  loophole  in  the  CAFE\u00b4 regulations.  SUVs  and  light  duty  trucks\u2014which  are  as  much  passenger  vehicles  as  station  wagons  and  sedans\u2014are  only  required  to  average  20.7  miles  per  gallon  per  fleet  versus  27.5  miles  per  gallon  for  automobiles.  Since  half  of  all  new  vehicles  sold  in  this  country  are  fuel-thirsty  SUVs  and  light  duty  trucks,  this  stranglehold  on  energy  efficiency  has  produced  an  American fleet with the worst fuel efficiency  since  1980.  We  are  going  backwards!  According  to  the  non-partisan  American  Council  for  an  Energy  Efficient  Economy,  the U.S.  saves  3 million  barCAFE\u00b4 rels  of  oil  a  day  because  of  standards. Close the SUV  loophole, as I  said  a  moment  ago,  and  save  another  million barrels each day.  Overall,  SUV  and  light  duty  truck  owners spend an extra $25 billion a year  U.S.  proVerDate Mar 15 2010  23:13 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S11AP0.REC S11AP0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m           ",

Colson  was  sentenced  by  U.S.  District  Court  Judge  Gerhard  Gesell  to  a  prison  term  of  1  to  3  years  and  fined  $5,000.  At  the  sentencing,  Judge  Gesell  deplored  Colson\u2019s  \u2018\u2018deliberate  misconduct\u2019\u2019 and he lectured him to understand  that  \u2018\u2018Morality  is  a  higher  force  than expediency.\u2019\u2019  In  his  book,  \u2018\u2018Born  Again,\u2019\u2019  Colson  talked  about  the  significance  of  what  he  had  done.  He  recalled  that  Judge  Gesell said, in his pretrial hearing:  The  whole  purpose  of  this  case,  beyond  its  immediate objective, is to direct some attention  to  the  desirability  of  having  a  government  of  law,  not  a  government  of men. That  is what this is [all] about.  Colson continued, in his own words:  It  is  something  I in school.  He said:  I  remembered  from  Civics  These  were  the  cardinal  principles  of  American  government,  the  real  bull-work  against  man-made  tyranny.  When  a  man\u2019s  constitutional  rights  are  in  jeopardy,  the  violation,  even  cloaked  in  the  time-honored  protective  shroud  of  national  security,  is  simply intolerable.  Colson  served  7 months  in  jail  before  the  court  reduced  his  sentence  to  time  served.  Now, what did Ken Bacon do?  Let\u2019s  go  to  the  Washington  May 22, 1998:  Post  of  The  Pentagon\u2019s  chief  spokesman  (Ken  Bacon)  apologized  today  for  authorizing  the  release  to  a  reporter  of  information  contained  in  Linda  R.  Tripp\u2019s  1987  security  clearance  form,  saying,  \u2018\u2018In  retrospect,  I\u2019m  sorry the incident occurred.\u2019\u2019  Bacon\u2019s  remarks  came  after  he  acknowledged in a deposition last Friday that he provided  the  New  Yorker  writer  Jane  Mayer  with the Tripp information.  So,  in  other  words,  he  admitted  it.  There  is  no  question  about  whether  or  not  he  committed  this  crime.  There  is  no  doubt  about  it,  no  dispute  about  it.  Bacon said:  I\u2019m  sorry  that  I  did  not  check  with  our  lawyers  or  check with Linda Tripp\u2019s  lawyers  about this.  Sorry?  Sorry  didn\u2019t  cut  it  for  Chuck  Colson.  Colson  committed  his  crime  in  July  of  1971.  He  admitted  his  guilt  and  pleaded  guilty  on  June  3,  1974,  and  was  sentenced to jail June 21, 1974.  Bacon  committed his  crime  in March  1998.  He  admitted  what  he  had  done  in  June  of  1998.  The  Pentagon  inspector  general  referred  the  matter  for  criminal prosecution in July of 1998. So now,  2  years  later,  in April  of  2000,  the  Clinton Justice Department says it is going  to  take  a  pass,  hoping  nobody  will  see  or care at this late date.  Colson  went  to  jail  and  served  time  in prison.  If  there was  justice, an equal  application  of  the  law,  Bacon  would  also go to jail and serve time in prison.  Is  this  the  first  time  the  Clinton  administration  has  been  involved  in  lawbreaking and corruption? Hardly.  It  has  almost  become  a  way  of  life:  Travelgate,  Filegate,  Buddhist  Temple  fundraisers,  illegal  foreign  campaign  contributions,  the  compromise  of  high-  technology  nuclear  secrets  to  China,  not to mention perjury and obstruction  of justice\u2014the list goes on and on.  Why  is  any  of  this  important?  It  is  all  about  a  concept  that  is  basic  to  America, a concept as basic as going to  church  on  Sunday.  That  concept  is:  Equal application of the law.  Only  the  media  can  ultimately  protect  this  fundamental  principle  by  informing  the  people  about  what  is  happening.  If  the  people  do  not  know,  of  course,  they  will  not  care.  The  role  of  the  media  is  critical  in  protecting  our  liberties.  So  again,  I  appeal  to  the  media  to  cover  this  story,  not  to  cover  up this story.  Does  anyone  care?  American  people  care.  be informed first.  Let  me  conclude  by  recalling  the  words  of  Chuck  Colson.

Senf  MARRIAGE  TAX  PENALTY  RELIEF  ACT  OF  2000\u2014Continued  Mr.  ROTH.  Mr.  President,  I  rise  to  discuss the centerpiece of our efforts to  reduce  the  tax  overpayment  by  America\u2019s  families.  The  Marriage  Tax  Penalty  Relief  Act  of  2000  delivers  savings  to  virtually  every  married  couple  in  America. And it does so within the context  of  fiscal  discipline  and  preserving  the Social Security surplus.  The  importance  of  this  measure  cannot  be  overstated.  According  to  the  most  recent  CBO  estimates,  in  1999,  43  percent  of  married  couples\u2014about  22  million  couples\u2014faced  the  marriage  tax  penalty.  The  average  penalty  was  $1,480 per couple. This was levied on individuals who are already overburdened  with  expenses\u2014the  costs  associated  with  buying  homes,  paying  for  education,  raising  children,  and  building  financial security for retirement.  It  isn\u2019t  fair,  Mr.  President.  It  isn\u2019t  fair  that  when  two  individuals  marry  their  combined  tax  liability  becomes  greater  than  if  they  had  remained  single and  continued  to pay  taxes at  their  single rate. But unfortunately, this has  been  the  case\u2014to  one  degree  or  another\u2014for more than 30 years.  Now it\u2019s time for a change.  It\u2019s  time  to  restore  equity\u2014to  bring  balance  and  fairness  into  the  tax  equation  for  these married  couples. This,  of  course,  is not  as  simple  as  it might  appear.  Our  tax  system  has  tried  to  balance  three  disparate  goals\u2014progressivity, equal treatment of married couples, and marriage neutrality. And it is  impossible  to  achieve  all  three  principles at the same time.  The  principle  of  progressivity  holds  that  taxpayers  with  higher  incomes  should pay a higher percentage of their  income  in  taxes. The  principle  of  equal  treatment  of  married  couples  holds  that  households with  the  same  amount  of  income  should  pay  the  same  level  of  tax. And the principle of marriage neutrality  holds  that  a  couple\u2019s  income  tax  bill  should  not  depend  on  their  marital  status.  The  tax  code  should  neither  provide  an  incentive  nor  a  disincentive  for  two  people  to  get  married.  Our  policy  response  differs  depending  on how we balance these different principles.  For  instance,  if  we  want  to  ensure  that when  two  singles get married  their  total  tax  bill  will  not  rise\u2014but  we  do  not  mind  if  two  married  couples  with  the  same  overall  income  level  are  treated  differently,  then  we  arrive  at  one  result.  However,  if  we  want  to  make  sure  that  two  singles  who marry  do  not  face  increased  taxes\u2014and  we  want  to  make  sure  that  two  married  couples with the same  income  level are  treated evenly\u2014then we arrive at a different result.  Last  year,  the  Senate  position  in  the  Taxpayer  Relief  Act  of  1999  embraced  the  first  policy  result.  We  focused  on  the  difference  between  what  two  spouses would pay in taxes if they were  single  versus  what  they  would  pay  in  taxes  if  they  were married.  In  order  to  fully  address  that  problem,  we  developed  a  system  whereby  a  married  couple  would  have  an  option.  The  couple  could  continue  to  file  a  joint  return  using  the  existing  schedule  of  married  filing  jointly.  Or  the  couple  could  choose  to  file  a  joint  return  using  the  separate schedules for single taxpayers.  It  was  straightforward,  and  it  was  universal\u2014we  did  not  try  to  impose  arbitrary  income  limits  to  cut  off  the  relief.  As  I said  last year, this approach had  a  lot  of  good  things  about  it. Most  importantly,  I  liked  the way  that  it  basically  eliminated  the  marriage  penalty  for  all  taxpayers  who  suffered  from  it.  It  delivered  relief  to  those  in  the  lowest  brackets  as  well  as  to  those  in  the  highest  brackets.  It  also  delivered  relief  to  those  who  itemized  their  deductions  as  well  as  those  who  took  the  standard deduction.

            "143": "S2516  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE April 11, 2000  The alternative,  it seems to me,  is to  shut  down  the  Senate  entirely.  I  don\u2019t  think  that  is  conducting  the  business  of  the  Senate  as  the  Senate  should  be  conducted.  I ask the distinguished leader, does it  appear  that  the  distinguished  group  from  the  minority  doesn\u2019t  want  to  debate  the  marriage  tax  penalty  at  all  and would prefer to shut down the Senate  rather  than  talk  about  this  very  important  tax  correction  for  the  hard-  working people of this country?  Mr.  LOTT.  If  we  can\u2019t  get  an  agreement  to  have  consideration  of  amendments  or  to  have  general  debate  or  to  have  a  morning  business  opportunity,  the  only  other  option  I  have  now  is  to  move to close the Senate for the day.  I hope we  can  find  some way  to work  that out.  Mr.  REID.  If  I  could  respond  to  my  friend  from  Texas,  I  think  maybe  we  have  watched  the  Senate  operate  the  way  it  is  not  supposed  to  for  so  long,  we  think  the  way  it  has  operated  the  past  year  is  the  way  it  is  supposed  to  operate.  The  way  the  Senate  is  supposed  to  operate  is  when  bringing  a  piece  of  legislation  to  the  floor,  it  is  open  for  debate  and  amendment\u2014not  morning business, not debate only.  We  have  the  opportunity  under  the  Standing  Rules  of  the  Senate  to  offer  amendments  to  pieces  of  legislation.  That is all we are asking. We have been  here  for  some  time.  This  session  of  Congress  is  about  over.  We  have  had  two  opportunities  to  offer  amendments  to  pieces  of  legislation,  two  amendments  that  were  agreed  upon  by  our  distinguished majority  leader,  and  also  the ad hoc chairman of  the Rules Committee in the Senate.  I  think  it  is  time we  have  legislation  brought  to  this  floor  and  we  treat  it  the  way  the  Senate  has  always  treated  it for 200-plus years.  Mr.  LOTT.  Mr.  President,  if  I  could  respond  to  Senator  REID\u2019s  comments  and  will  yield  further  to  Senator  I  believe  just  last  week  we  had  the  budget  resolution,  and  we  had  well  over  100  amendments.  Some  of  them were voted on, some of them were  accepted,  some  of  them  were  voted  on  in  the  vote-arama.  A  number  of  them  didn\u2019t relate to the budget for the year.  Everything  imaginable  was  thrown  in.  I  don\u2019t  think  Senators  have  felt  as  if  they  haven\u2019t  had  a  chance  to  offer  amendments on any kind of extraneous  matter.  This  issue  of  the  marriage  tax  penalty  is  clear  and  understandable:  Are  Members for it or against it?  I  fear  my  colleagues  on  the  Democratic  side  are  trying  to  change  the  subject.  I  cannot  believe  they  don\u2019t  want  to  eliminate  the  marriage  tax  penalty.  Let\u2019s  have  a  full  debate,  let\u2019s  have amendments on the marriage penalty.  But  to  get  off  into  every  other  possible  issue  as  a  way  to  try  to  distract  attention  from  doing  what  the  American  people  support  overwhelmingly, I don\u2019t understand that.  I  think  what  we  are  trying  to  do  makes  good,  common  sense. Let\u2019s  have  HUTCHISON,  to  comHUTCHISON a  full  debate  on  the  issue.  Let\u2019s  have  relevant  amendments.  There  are  a  lot  of amendments that could be construed  as being relevant.  I  remember  the  Democrats  came  up  with  a  way  to  offer  a  gun  amendment  to  the  education  savings  account,  as  I  recall.  They  went  way  around  the  corner to get it done, but we had a vote on  it, and we moved on.  Senator  wants  ment or ask a question.  Mrs. HUTCHISON.  I was going to ask  the  distinguished  leader  if  the  comments made are correct that he has approved  every  amendment  that  came  forward.  It  seems  to  me  we  have  voted  on  a  number  of  amendments  that  wouldn\u2019t  have  been  the  choice  of  the  majority  leader, but  the majority  leader  has  tried  to  accommodate  the  minority.  I  can\u2019t  think  of  anything  we  haven\u2019t  voted  on  this  year.  Frankly,  I  can\u2019t  think  of  one  issue  that  we  haven\u2019t  addressed,  whether  we  wanted  to or not.  The  idea  being  put  forward  that  somehow  the  majority  leader  is  running  the  Senate  as  if  it  is  under  his  control,  I  think,  is  so  far out of bounds  it  is  almost  laughable.  I  hope  we  could  at  least  have  morning  business  to  talk  about  whatever  issues  Members  want  to discuss.  I  want  to  talk  about  the  marriage  tax  penalty.  My  distinguished  colleague  from  Illinois  wants  to  talk  about  organ  transplants.  I  can\u2019t  imagine  why  the  distinguished  minority  would  object  to  morning  business  so  Members  from  his  side  and  Members  from  our  side  could  talk  until,  hopefully, the majority and minority leader  are  able  to  come  to  an  agreement  on  some  kind  of  reasonable  timetable  so  we  can  enact  marriage  tax  penalty  relief for the 21 million American couples  who pay a penalty, who are going to be  writing  their  checks  to  the  U.S.  Government  this  week,  realizing  they  are  paying  $800,  $1,000,  $1,400  or  more  just  because  they  are  married  and  because  the  Tax  Code  clearly  has  an  inequity  that we have the ability to address.  We  can  have  legitimate  disagreements  on  this  issue.  If  we  are  going  to  have  irrelevant  amendments,  I  ask  the  American  people  to  look  at  the  issue  for what  it  is.  Let Members  debate,  let  Members  talk  about  our  differences  on  the  issue.  I  hope  the  distinguished  minority won\u2019t shut down the Senate.  Mr.  LOTT.  I  thank  the  Senator  her comments.  Let  me  add,  perhaps  it  is  just  that  Senator  and  the  Democrats  need  more  time  to  work  on  amendments  and  to  get  to  our  side  some  description  of  the  amendments.  Maybe  we  can  go  ahead  and  go  out  tonight.  That  way,  we  have  the  rest  of  the  evening  and  the  night  to  work  on  amendments  and  pick  up  again  tomorrow.  I am trying to find a way to keep the  discussion  going. We  could  use  another  hour  or  so  to  debate  this  or  other  issues.  DASCHLE for  DORGAN If  we  can  think  of  a  way  to  do  that,  I am open to considering other options.  I  indicated  to  Senator  I  would yield to him.  Mr.  DORGAN.  I  appreciate  the  majority  leader  yielding.  I  want  to  make  an  observation  with  the  question:  As  I  understand,  the  majority  leader  has  sent  to  the  desk  two  cloture  motions,  one  on  the  underlying  bill  and  one  on  the  substitute,  for  purposes,  as  he  described,  to  shut  off  a  filibuster  which  I  suggest  does  not  exist.  That  is  all  right. That is within the rules. We have  all read the rule book in the Senate.  Circumstances  in  the  Senate  should  exist  in  the  following  manner.  You  bring  a  piece  of  legislation  to  the  floor  of  the  Senate.  Every  Senator  here  has  a  desk.  You  come  here  and  you  have  certain  rights  and  certain  opportunities. One  of  those  is  to  offer  an  amendment  to  legislation  brought  before  the  Senate.  As  I  understand  the  Senator  from Mississippi, he  is  saying he wants  to  see  amendments  Senators  are  going  to  offer.  He  would  like  to  see  them  before he makes a judgment about whether  in  fact  they will be allowed  to be offered.  I say the reason there is a substantial  amount  of  anxiety  building  up  in  this  Senate  is  that  people  were  not  elected  from  various  States  to  say:  Go  and  do  your  thing  in  the  Senate  under  the  rules,  and,  by  the  way,  we  would  like  the  majority  leader  to  decide  which  amendments  you  offer  shall  be  in  order.  Mr.  LOTT.  Mr.  President,  if  I  could  respond to that particular point,  it  is a  common  practice  around  here,  as  I  am  sure  the  Senator  knows,  to  give  the  courtesy  of  identifying  what  amendments  we  have  and  even  the  amendments.  We  are  not  asking  to  see  the  amendments.  We  are  asking  to  have  some  idea  of  the  general  parameters  of  what is being proposed.  I  do  not  believe  that  is  asking  too  much.  We  do  that  for  each  other.  Senator  wants  to  see  what  we  want  to  offer,  and we want  to  see what  you  want  to  offer.  That  is  a  common  practice around here.  Mr. DORGAN. Except, if the majority  leader  will  yield  further,  that  is  not  what  you  are  trying  to  do.  What  you  have  indicated  is you want to  limit the  amendments.  It  is  not  a  case  of  being  curious  to  see  what  we  are  going  to  offer.  This  goes  on  bill  after  bill  after  bill  that  is  brought  to  the  Senate. You  want to limit the amendments.  My  point  is  this.  When  we  deal  with  legislation  on  the  floor  of  the  Senate,  everyone  here  has  a  right,  it  seems  to  me, to come and offer amendments and  have  a  debate  on  them.  You  have  just  filed  two  cloture  motions  to  shut  off  debate  on  a  filibuster  that  doesn\u2019t  exist.  This  happens  time  and  time  again, and we are getting tired of it.  Mr. LOTT.  I  can  understand  the Senator\u2019s  frustration.  Also,  I  am  sure  he  can  understand  that,  as  the  majority  leader,  I  have  to  pay  attention  to  the  schedule,  the  time  that  is  available,  DASCHLE VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:13 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S11AP0.REC S11AP0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",
            "151": "S2524  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE April 11, 2000  Conference.  This  event  should  serve  to  underscore  Sandia  Laboratories\u2019  staunch commitment to a safe and stable  international  security  environment.  The success of this annual event owes  itself  to  Jim\u2019s  reputation,  his  integrity,  his  personal  relationships  with  a  broad  range  of  policy  makers  throughout the global arms control community  and  their  trust  in  him.  Jim\u2019s  diligence  has  enabled  the  Albuquerque  conference  to  grow  even  more  in  stature  each  year  bringing  credit  on  Sandia,  the  Department  of  Energy  and  the  State of New Mexico.  Mr.  President,  New  Mexico  is  fortunate to have Dr. Brown as a citizen.\u2211  f  \u2211 DARVIN  OF  THE  ENVIRONLEARNING  OF  MR.  FOUNDER  HEIGHTS  RESOURCES  RECOGNITION  ECKLUND,  CEDAR  MENTAL  CENTER  Mr.  GORTON.  Mr.  President,  in  a  continuing  effort  to  recognize  excellence  in  education  I  would  like  to  award  Darvin  Ecklund  of  the  Cedar  Heights  Environmental  Resources  Learning  Center  in  Port  Orchard,  Washington  with  an  \u2018Innovation  in  Education\u2019  Award.  Two  years  ago,  Mr.  Ecklund,  a  Natural  Resources  teacher  at  Cedar  Heights  Junior  High,  created  an  after  school  center  that  focuses  on  environmental  activities  and  teaches  students  the  importance  of  rehabilitating  our  local  natural  resources.  I  think  Mr.  Ecklund\u2019s  concept  is  a  remarkable after school option  for  junior  high  students  as  an  alternative,  safe  environment  where  they  can  learn  and  have fun at the same time.  The  focus  of  the  Cedar  Heights  Environmental  Resources  Learning  Center  aims  to  stimulate  kids  toward  saving  the  environment  around  them.  Recently,  the  Center  renovated  local  ponds  and  developed  plant  life  to  be  used  in  future  rehabilitation  projects.  Children  learn  to  identify  common  and  scientific  names  of  plants  and  wildlife.  To  date,  over  six  hundred  salmon  have  been  raised  in  this  Center!  This  is  a  truly  remarkable  way  to  integrate  science  into  children\u2019s  lives  with  a  hands on approach.  We  all  know  that  we  live  in  a  busy  world  where  sometimes  kids  end  up  waiting  for  their  parents  to  return  from  work.  I  cannot  think  of  a  better  way  to  see  kids  spend  a  few  hours  after-school,  as  well  as  getting  parents  involved  in  their  children\u2019s  after-  school  activities.  Currently,  there  are  over  one  hundred  kids  participating  in  this  program. High  school  students  are  also  part  of  Mr.  Ecklund\u2019s  staff  and  help organize activities and provide assistance as well.  Mr. Ecklund has also  found a way  for  kids  at  the  Cedar  Heights  Environmental  Resources  Learning  Center  to  develop  a  relationship  with  the  retirement community across the street. The  Center offers retirees an educational as  well  as  relaxing  place  to  come  and  share  time with  the  students. The Center  has made  the  paths  around  the  Environmental  Center  wheel-chair  accessible.  After  hearing  this,  I  was  encouraged  that  this  community  has  found  a  way  to  connect  young  people  not  only  to the environment, but to their elders.  I  applaud  Mr.  Ecklund  for  creating  such  an  innovative  program  that  connects  older  and  younger  students  to  helping  the  environment  and  spending  time with seniors.  Ms.  Pat  Green,  Principal  of  Cedar  Heights Junior High, said the following  about  Mr.  Ecklund:  \u2018\u2018He  is  passionate  about  the  environment  and  teaching  kids  how  to  raise  fish  as  a  sustainable  resource.  The  kids  are  learning  hands-  on science in action!\u2033  Mr.  Pat  Oster,  Assistant  Principal  of  Cedar  Heights  Junior  High  commends  Mr.  Ecklund\u2019s  efforts,  describing  him  as,  \u2018\u2018a very caring and energetic person  who  devotes  generous  time  to  the  many  students  he  interacts  with  on  a  daily basis.\u2019\u2019  I  have  been  a  long  supporter  of  preserving  the  environment.  I  am  impressed  by  the  originality  of  this  program  and  hope  other  after-school  centers  will  follow  in  the  footsteps  of  the  Cedar  Heights  Environmental  Resources  Learning  Center.  This  is  truly  science in action!\u2211  f  \u2211 MRS.  KATHERINE  G.  HEIDEMAN\u2019S  90TH  BIRTHDAY  Mr.  ABRAHAM. Mr.  President,  I  rise  to  recognize  Mrs.  Katherine  Grayson  Graham  Heideman,  resident  of  Hancock,  MI,  who  today  is  celebrating  her  90th  birthday.  It  is  my  pleasure  to  honor  her  not  only  for  having  reached  this  landmark  birthday,  which  is  quite  an  accomplishment  in  itself,  but  also,  and  I  think more  importantly,  for having  lived  her  life  in  a  manner  truly  worthy of commendation.  Mrs. Heideman was  born  in Audubon,  Iowa,  the  daughter  of  Katherine  Grayson Brown and James Melville Graham.  She was  the  youngest  of  six  daughters.  After  attending  high  school  in  Audubon,  she  headed  out  west  to  continue  her  education,  first  receiving  a  B.A.  from  the  University  of  California-Los  Angeles  in  1931,  and  then  in  1934  earning  an  M.A.  from  the  University  of  Southern  California.  For  the  next  twenty  years,  Mrs.  Heideman  taught  English  literature  classes  to  intermediate  students  in  four  different  states:  California,  Michigan,  Illinois,  and the District of Columbia.  On  July  6,  1934,  Katherine  married  Bert  Heideman.  The  couple  remained  together  until  in  1991,  when  Mr.  Heideman passed away. They had three  children  together,  Eric,  Bert,  and  Eric.  The  eldest  child  unfortunately  died  just  six  months  after  he  was  born,  and  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Heideman  named  their  third child in his honor and memory.  In  1958,  Mrs.  Heideman  became  the  first  woman  to  be  named  Houghton  County,  Michigan,  Superintendent  of  Schools. She served in this capacity for  four  years,  then  spent  twelve  years  as  Superintendent  of  the  Copper  Country  Intermediate School System, which  includes  Houghton,  Baraga,  and  Keweenaw  counties.  During  these  years,  Mrs.  Heideman  was  a  pioneer  in  developing  special  education  initiatives.  All  of  her  efforts  culminated  in  1974,  when  the  Heideman  Bill,  HB5013,  was  passed  into  law  in  the  State  of  Michigan. This law made it possible for  an  intermediate  school  district  to  own  and  operate  a  school  for  handicapped  children.  In 1982, Mrs. Heideman was elected to  the  Hancock  City  Council,  and  there  she  has  continued  to  fight  not  only  for  the  rights  of  disabled  individuals,  but  also  for  the  environment  and  the  historic  preservation  of Houghton  county.  She  is  the  author  of  a  resolution  forbidding  any  nuclear  or  toxic  waste  to  be transported through the city of Hancock,  and  of  a  resolution  condemning  the  dumping  of  iron  ore  tailings  into  Lake  Superior.  Mrs.  Heideman  was  a  charter  member  of  the  Hancock  Historic  Preservation  Commission,  and  continues to be a strong voice in the efforts  to  retain  the  city\u2019s  old  world  charm. She has played an instrumental  role  in  the  attempt  to  get  the  city  of  Hancock  recognized  as  being  the  Finnish  American  culture  center  of  the  United  States.  And,  due  to  her  efforts,  a  sister  city  relationship  was  formed  with  the  citizens  of Porvoo, Finland. A  candidate  seven  times,  she  now  begins  her  eighteenth  year  representing  the  first ward.  Mr.  President,  I  applaud  Mrs.  Heideman  for  her  selfless  dedication  to  improving  the  quality  of  life  for  individuals  not  only  in  the  city  of  Hancock, but  the entire State of Michigan.  She  is  a  remarkable  woman  and  a  true  role  model.  On  behalf  of  the  entire  United  States  Senate,  I  wish  Mrs.  Heideman  a  happy  ninetieth  birthday,  and best of luck in the future.\u2211  f  MESSAGES  FROM  THE  PRESIDENT  Messages  from  the  President  of  the  United  States  were  communicated  to  the  Senate  by  Ms.  Evans,  one  of  his  secretaries.

A  bill  to  establish  a  grant  program  that  provides  incentives  for  States  to  enact  mandatory  minimum  sentences  for  certain  firearms  offenses,  and  for  other  purposes;  to  the  Committee on the Judiciary.  PROJECT EXILE: THE SAFE STREETS 2000  NEIGHBORHOODS ACT OF AND  \u2211 Mr.  DEWINE.  Mr.  President,  I  come  to  the  floor  today  because  I  am  troubled.  Guns  are  falling  into  the  wrong  hands.  It\u2019s  killing  our  children.  It\u2019s  killing  our  friends  and  our  neighbors.  It\u2019s  creating  mayhem  in  communities  across  America.  That\u2019s  why  I\u2019m  introducing  Project  Exile:  The  Safe  Streets  and Neighborhoods Act of 2000.  It\u2019s  no  secret  that  gun  control measures  are  very  controversial  and  are  subject  to  a  great  deal  of  debate\u2014as  they should be. But, in the heat of that  debate,  we  must  not  lose  sight  of  the  real issue\u2014gun violence. There is nothing  controversial  about  protecting  our  children,  our  families  and  our  communities by keeping guns out of the wrong  hands\u2014the  hands  of  armed  criminals\u2014  not law-abiding citizens, Mr. President,  but criminals.  The  Safe  Streets  and  Neighborhoods  Act  offers  a  simple,  commonsense  approach  to  fighting  gun  violence.  My  bill  would  provide  $100  million  in  grants  over  5  years  to  those  states  agreeing  to  impose  mandatory  minimum  5-year  jail  sentences  on  criminals  who  use  or  possess  an  illegal  gun.  As  an  alternative,  a  state  can  also  qualify for the grants by turning armed  criminals  over  for  federal  prosecution  under  existing  firearms  laws.  Therefore,  a  state  has  the  option  of  having  armed felons prosecuted in state or federal  courts.  Qualifying  states  can  use  their grants for any purpose that would  strengthen the ability of their criminal  or juvenile justice systems to deal with  violent criminals.  Back  in  1991,  the  Federal  Government  implemented  a  program  to  aim  antigun  violence  efforts  at  the  root  of  the  problem\u2014at  criminals.  This  program\u2014known  as  project  Triggerlock\u2014  directed  every  U.S.  attorney  to  coordinate  with  federal,  state,  and  local  investigators  to  bring  federal  weapons  charges  against  armed  criminals.  Sentences  for  these  prosecutions  wee  generally  more  severe  than  they  would  have  been  under  state  laws.  The  program  was  hugely  successful.  In  fact,  simply  by  making  gun  prosecutions  a  federal  priority,  starting  in  1991,  Project  Triggerlock  took  away  over  2,000 guns  from violent  felons  in  just  18  months.  Tragically, Mr. President, despite the  success of Project Triggerlock, the current  administration  has  not  aggressively  prosecuted  all  armed  criminals.  Between  1992 and  1998,  for  example,  the  number  of  gun  cases  filed  for  prosecution  dropped  from  7,048  to  about  3,807\u2014  that\u2019s  a  46-percent  decrease.  As  a  result,  the  number  of  federal  criminal  convictions  for  firearms  offenses  have  fallen dramatically.  Even  worse,  some  federal  firearms  laws  are  almost  never  enforced  by  this  administration. While  Brady  law  background  checks  have  stopped  nearly  300,000  prohibited  purchasers  of  firearms  from  buying  guns,  less  than  one-  tenth  of  one  percent  have  been  prosecuted.  Similarly,  federal  criminal  prosecutions for possession of a firearm  on  school  grounds  numbered  just  eight  in  1998,  despite  the  fact  that  6,000  individuals  were  caught  carrying  guns  to  school.  There\u2019s  something  wrong  with  this  picture,  Mr.  President,  something  terribly wrong.  I  believe  most  Americans  would  agree  that  we  should  take  guns  out  of  the hands of armed  criminals.  I believe  that  most  Americans  would  agree  that  criminals  who  possess  a  firearm  or  use  a  firearm  during  the  commission  of  a  violent  crime  or  a  serious  drug  trafficking  offense  should  face  severe  penalties.  And,  Mr.  President,  I  also  believe  that most Americans would  favor  legislation  that  offers  a  single,  noncontroversial,  commensense  approach  to fighting gun violence.  So,  today,  I,  along  with  my  colleagues,  introduce  Project  Exile:  The  Safe  Streets  and  Neighbors  Act,  which  builds  on  the  previous  success  of  programs  like  Project  Triggerlock  and  offers  the  kind  of  practical  solution  we  need to thwart gun crimes.  This  approach  works,  Mr.  President.  For  example,  in  1997,  Virginia  revived  Project  Triggerlock  under  the  name  \u2018\u2018Project  Exile.\u2019\u2019  Specifically,  the  city  of Richmond and  the U.S. attorney  implemented a program based on one simple principle: any criminal caught with  a  gun  serves  a  minimum  mandatory  sentence  of  5  years  in  federal  prison.  Period.  End  of  story.  As  a  result,  gun-  toting  criminals  are  being  prosecuted  six  times  faster,  and  serving  sentences  up  to  four  times  longer  than  they  otherwise  would  under  state  law.  Moreover,  the  homicide  rate  in  Richmond  already has dropped 40 percent.  It  is clear that programs  like Project  Triggerlock  and  Virginia\u2019s  Project  Exile  work,  while  at  the  same  time  being  very  simple.  But  still,  federal  gun  prosecutions  have  declined  considerably  during  this  administration  because  it  has  not  emphasized  these  programs.  Why?  I  have  repeatedly  questioned  Attorney  General  Reno  and  her  deputies  about  this  decline,  and  their  standard  response  is  that  the  Department of Justice is focusing on so-called  \u2018\u2018high-level\u2019\u2019 offenders, instead of  \u2018\u2018low-  level\u2019\u2019  offenders  who  commit  a  crime  with a gun. With all due  respect,  I consider  that  response  to  be  bureaucratic  nonsense.  One  thing  I  learned  as  Greene  County  Prosecutor  in my  home  state  of  Ohio  is  that  any  criminal  who  commits  a  crime  with  a  gun  is  a  high-  level  offender.  And,  I\u2019m  willing  to  bet  that  any  citizen  who  has  ever  been  a  victim of a gun-crime would agree.  Furthermore,  the  idea  that  there  are  a  lot of  so-called  \u2018\u2018low-level\u2019\u2019 offenders,  who  commit  only  one  crime  with  a  gun,  is  just  plain  wrong.  The  average  armed  criminal  commits  160  crimes  a  year; that is an average of three crimes  per  week.  These  people  are,  by  themselves, walking crime waves.  Along  the  same  lines,  Attorney  General  Reno  recently  said  that  she  would  aggressively  prosecute  armed  criminals, but only  if  they commit a violent  crime. Again,  that  type  of  law  enforcement  policy  just  does  not  make  sense.  Current  law  prohibits  felons  from  possessing  guns\u2014we  should  enforce  the  law.  We  should  aggressively  prosecute  armed  criminals  before  they  use  those  guns to injure and kill people.  We  need  to  take  all  of  these  armed  criminals  off  the  streets.  That  is  how  we  will  prevent  crime  and  save  lives.  Why  wait  for  armed  criminals  to  commit  more  heinous  crimes  before  we  prosecute them to the full extent of the  law?  Why  wait  when  we  can  do  something  that  will  make  a  difference  now,  before  another  Ohioan\u2014or  any  American\u2014becomes  a  victim  of  gun  violence.  Every  state  should  have  the  opportunity  to  implement  Project  Exile  in  their high-crime  communities. The bill  that  we  are  introducing  today  will  make  this  proven,  commonsense  approach  to  reducing  gun  violence  available  to  every  state.  Programs  like  Project  Triggerlock  and  Project  Exile  will  take  guns  out  of  the  hands  of  violent  criminals.  They  will  make  our  neighborhoods  safer.  They  will  save  lives.  We  can  take  concrete  steps  toward  making  our  streets  and  neighborhoods  safer  from  armed  criminals  by  passing  the  \u2018\u2018Safe  Streets  and  Neighborhoods  Act.\u2019\u2019  I  urge  my  colleagues  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  to  support  and  pass  this  legislation.  It\u2019s  time  to  protect  our children and our  families.  It\u2019s  time  to get guns out of the wrong hands. It\u2019s  time  we  take  back  our  neighborhoods  and  our  communities  from  the  criminals  and  take  action  to  stop  gun  crimes.\u2211  By Mr. ROTH:  S.  2391.

LANE  EVANS OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, April 11, 2000 Mr.  EVANS.  Mr.  Speaker,  the  loss  and  suffering  of  Vietnam  veterans  and  their  loved ones  due  to  the  use  of  Agent  Orange  is  one of  the  sad  legacies  of  the  Vietnam  War  that continues  to  haunt  our  nation.  Because  of  our nation\u2019s  use  of  herbicides  during  the  war,  tens of  thousands  of  Vietnam  veterans  have  died or  live  daily  with  the  scars  of  disease.  As  any veteran  will  tell  you,  the  scars  of  war  are  not just  physical,  but  also  emotional.  Too  many veterans  and  their  loved  ones  live  each  day with  the  continuing  pain  of  dealing  with  the loss  and  the  illnesses  caused  by  Agent  Orange. Next  week,  the  \u2018\u2018quilts  of  tears\u2019\u2019  will  arrive  in Washington,  DC.  This  is  an  important  event because  the  quilts  tell  many  of  the  stories  that need  to  be  told  about  the  devastation  this tragedy has exacted on  too many  lives. Recently,  I  received  a  letter  from Ms.  Jennie R.  LeFevre,  an  Agent Orange widow, who  eloquently  describes  her  own  experiences  as well as  the  legacy  left  of  broken  soldiers  and  broken  families.  I  believe  it  captures  the  essence of  the  Agent  Orange  tragedy  as  well  as  the costs  that  our  nation  continues  to  pay  for  a war  that  ended  almost  twenty-five  years  ago. The  quilts  will  arrive  on  the  Mall  on  April  17 and  will  be  available  for  viewing  near  the  Vietnam Memorial.  They will  also  be  on  display  on Memorial  Day  on  the  banks  of  the  Reflecting Pool.  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  visit  this  moving and  unforgettable  memorial.  Ms. LeFevre  follows: The  letter  from THE TEARS QUILTS OF Agent Orange has been interwoven into the fabric of the lives of many Vietnam Veterans and  their  families.  To  tell  their  story,  the \u2018\u2018Quilts  of  Tears\u2019\u2019  project  was  created.  It  is to show the world the suffering and pain that the Agent Orange Victims  and  their  families have  endured.  Each  block  in  the  \u2018\u2018Quilts  of Tears\u2019\u2019  reflect  their  struggles  with  life  and death  issues  of  Agent  Orange.  Agent  Orange has  left  invisible  scars  on  the  hearts  and minds of these victims and their families. I  have  recently  heard  these  words  about Vietnam  Veterans.  The  words  are,  \u2018\u2018All  gave some, but some gave all\u2019\u2019. Such is the case of the  thousands of who have already  lost  their lives  to  the  great  tragedy  Agent  Orange,  for they were killed in Vietnam and didn\u2019t know it.  They  were  killed  by  the  silent  and  invisible  bullet,  Agent  Orange.  Their  names  do not  appear  on  the  black  granite  Wall  in Washington,  DC,  the  \u2018\u2018Quilts  of  Tears\u2019\u2019  are their Wall. The  \u2018\u2018Quilts  of Tears\u2019\u2019 was  founded  by  Jennie  R.  LeFevre  of  Shady  Side,  MD,  Founder and  President  of  the  Agent  Orange  Victims and Widows Support Network. The quilts are a  Tribute,  Memorial  and  Honor  to  the  Vietnam  Agent  Orange  Victims,  both  living  and dead.  Each  block  represents  a  victim,  and they  show  the  victim\u2019s  unit  in  Nam,  years served in Nam and the nature of the victim\u2019s health  problems  relating  to  Agent  Orange. At  present,  there  are  ten  quilts,  each  measuring  80  by  100  inches,  each  quilt  contains  20 blocks.  At  displays,  the  quilts  are  hung  on walls  or  spread  on  the  ground  with  walking space  between  each  one  to  allow  viewing from any angle. \u2018\u2018The Quilt of Tears\u2019\u2019 project is  mentioned  throughout  the  Internet  on many  of  the  Vietnam  Veterans  websites  and e-mail  forums  and  indeed  the  \u2018\u2018Quilts  of Tears\u2019\u2019 has a website of its own as well. Mothers,  sisters,  and  other  family  members  have  adorned  the  blocks  with  their loved  one\u2019s  picture,  unit  patches,  military emblems,  medals,  awards,  etc.,  etc.  The quilts  were  displayed  for  the  first  time  on the  Mall  in  Washington,  DC  several  years ago. They have since traveled to a quilt show in  NJ,  several  Vietnam  Veteran\u2019s  Reunions in  St.  Louis, MO,  and  were  also  displayed  at the  Vietnam  Veteran  Reunion  in  Kokomo, Ind.  They  were  on  display  a  year  ago  Veterans  Day  in  the  Rotunda  of  the  Utah  State Capitol.  The  quilts  are  called  the  \u2018\u2018Quilts  of Tears\u2019\u2019  because  many  tears  have  been  shed for  these  victims.  \u2018\u2018The  Quilts  of  Tears\u2019\u2019  already  have  letters  of  acknowledgment  and endorsement  from  both  the  Agent  Orange Coordinating  Council  and  Vietnam  Veterans of  America,  Inc.,  headquarters  in  Washington, DC. I  am  an  Agent  Orange  widow  myself,  my late  husband,  a  veteran  of  both  the  Korean and  Vietnam  War,  died  with  cancer  in  ten parts  of  his  body.  Unfortunately,  the  VA states  the  cancer  he  had  was  not  related  to his  exposure  to  Agent  Orange  so  there  I  am not  compensated.  I  believe Agent Orange  did cause his death. I am a member of the Agent Orange  Coordinating  Council,  chaired  by  the late  Admiral  Zumwalt  and  have  been  on  the Council  for  seven  years.  I  made  a  block  for Admiral\u2019s  son  with  the  words  inscribed  \u2018\u2018A Great Warrior Son\u2019\u2019 which Admiral Zumwalt requested  to  be  put  on  his  son\u2019s  block.  The block is now a part of the Quilts of Tears. \u2018\u2018The  Quilts  of  Tears\u2019\u2019  are  the Wall  for  the Agent  Orange  Victims.  Their  stories  need  to be mentioned for all of the suffering and pain they  have  endured  in  love  and  honor  for their  country,  the  quilts  do  just  that.  One has  only  to  look  at  the  quilts  to  see  for themselves  what  has  happened  to  these  victims. After the display in Kokomo, I received a  letter  from a veteran who stated the quilts were  the  most  moving  piece  of  art  he  had seen  since  the  Wall  in  Washington,  DC.  A veteran with Agent Orange problems saw the display in Washington, he said he had no one to  make  a  block  for  him,  I  told  him  that  I would  do  it  for  him.  Later  he  sent  me  his Purpose Heart to put on the block. One of his prized  possessions,  he  insists  that  it  be placed on his block. These  quilts  are  very  dear  to  the  hearts  of the  Vietnam  Veterans,  the  Agent  Orange Victims,  and  their  families.  Over  Memorial Day  weekend  last  year,  a  big  burly  veteran looked  at  the  quilts  beside  the  Reflecting pool,  walked  a  short  distance  away,  fell  to his  knees  and  burst  into  tears.  When  I  went to  him  and  hugged  him,  he  asked  \u2018\u2018Am  I next?\u2019\u2019. The next display of the quilts will be on  Monday  April  17,  10:00  a.m.  at  the  \u2018\u2018In Memory\u2019\u2019  ceremony  near  the  Wall,  weather permitting,  and  they will  be  on  the  banks  of the  Reflecting  Pool  over  memorial  Day weekend.  I  invite  you  and  the  general  public to come and view them. Recently,  I  was  at  an  Agent  Orange  meeting  and  another  Agent  Orange  widow  took  a pin  off  her  blouse  and  put  it  on my  sweater. The  pin  was  a  black  heart  edged  in  gold,  a jagged  streak  was  across  the  heart  to  represent  a  broken  heart  and  in  the  center  of the  heart  was  an  orange  teardrop.  Yes,  our hearts  are  broken  for  the  Agent  Orange  Victims. The  late  Admiral  Elmo  Zumwalt  Jr.  was  a real  friend  and  advocate  for  the  Agent  Orange  Victims  and  their  families.  May  his memory  and  devotion  to  the  Agent  Orange issue  live  on  in  our  hearts  forever.  Those  of us who are a part of the Agent Orange struggle  say  \u2018\u2018We  will  never  allow  the  Agent  Orange Victims to be Forgotten\u2019\u2019. Most Sincerely, JENNIE R. LEFEVRE, Agent Orange Widow. f CONGRATULATIONS  TO  JACOBS DR.  IRWIN HON.

He was  the\u2014 First master  to  teach  Tae Kwon Do  in America:  Master  Rhee  introduced  Tae  Kwon  Do  to America  in 1956. First  master  to  work  out  to  music:  Master Rhee  created  the  Martial  Arts  Ballet  and  gave birth  to  the Exercise  to Music  craze. First  master  to  invent  safety  equipment: Master  Rhee  invented  martial  arts  safety equipment  after  one  of  his  students  was  injured  in  a  competition.  The  introduction  of safety  equipment  enabled  martial  arts  studios to  get  insurance.  Because  of  that,  parents began  to  send  their  kids  to martial  arts  instructors, and  the martial arts  industry was born. First  master  to  promote  martial  arts  in  U.S.  through  television advertising. First  master  to  use  the  color  belt  system:  At one  time,  martial  arts  awarded  only  white, brown  or  black  belts.  Master  Rhee  introduced the  color  belt  award  system  now  used  worldwide. First  master  who  also  is  a  concert  musician: Master  Rhee  was  the  featured  musician  with the  Washington  Symphony  Orchestra.  He played  classical music on  the harmonica. First  master  to  require  black  belt  scholastic excellence:  For  more  than  30  years,  Master Rhee  has  required  his  students  to  maintain  a \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019  average  or  better  to  qualify  for  a  black belt. First  master  to  train  Members  of  Congress in  martial  arts:  Master  Rhee  founded  the  U.S. Congressional  Tae  Kwon  Do  Club,  where  he has  taught  Members  of  Congress  without interruption  since 1965. the First  American  to  open  martial  arts  studios in  the  Soviet  Union:  Master  Rhee  first  traveled to Moscow  in  1991  to  teach Tae Kwon Do  and now  has  65  Jhoon  Rhee  Do  studios  throughout  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States. Learning  English  is  a  requirement  for  a  black belt. First  to  teach martial arts  in America\u2019s public schools: Master Rhee  launched  his  Joy  of Discipline  program  of  martial  arts  and  character education  in  America\u2019s  public  schools  in  the early 1980s. First  Tae  Kwon Do master  to  star  in  his  own movies: Master  Rhee  starred  with  Angela Mao in  When  Tae  Kwon  Do  Strikes.  As  Grand Master  Lee,  he  is  the  underground  leader  of  a group  of  patriots  in  Japanese  occupied  Korea. First  martial  artist  to  train  a  world  heavyweight  boxing  champion:  Master  Rhee  taught the  legendary  Bruce  Lee  his  kicking  techniques,  and  Bruce  Lee  taught  him  how  to punch.  Master  Rhee  then  taught  Muhammad Ali  what  Ali  later  called  his  powerful  \u2018\u2018Accupunch.\u2019\u2019  Ali  used  it  in  1976  to  knock  out  Bruce Denn  in  Munich  and  also  in  the  Joe  Frazier heavyweight  title bout. First  martial  artist  to  be  named  Man  of  the Century:  And  now,  Master  Rhee  is  the  first and  only  native  Korean  to  be  named  as  one of  America\u2019s  top  200  immigrants  of  all  time. Mr.  Speaker,  the  National  Immigrant  Forum made  a  wise  choice.  He  is  a  man  of  character and  the  prototype  role  model  for  the  new  century.  I  can  think  of  few  others  so  worthy  of such a designation. f PERSONAL  EXPLANATION HON.  WILLIAM  L.  JENKINS OF TENNESSEE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, April 11, 2000 Mr.  JENKINS.  Mr.  Speaker,  on  Monday, April  10,  2000  if  I  had  been  present,  I  would have  voted  \u2018\u2018nay\u2019\u2019  on  the  Spratt  Motion  to  Instruct  Conferees  on  H.  Con.  Res.  290  instead of  \u2018\u2018yea\u2019\u2019 as  indicated  in my explanation. f A  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE  TO MARTHA  MANUEL  CHACON HON.  JERRY  LEWIS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, April 11, 2000 Mr.  LEWIS  of  California.  Mr.  Speaker,  I would  like  to  bring  to  your  attention  the  recent passing  of  Martha  Manuel  Chacon,  and  elder and  tribal  leader  of  the  San  Manuel  Band  of Mission  Indians,  who  helped  the  tribe maintain its  pride  and  traditions  and  simultaneously  setting  it  on  a  course  of  future  self-reliance.  Mrs. Chacon  passed  away  on  March  28  at  the  age of 89. Martha  Manuel  Chacon  was  born  in  a  tworoom  adobe  house  without  floors  and  was raised  on  the  San  Manuel  Reservation  in Highland,  California.  She  was  the  granddaughter  of  Santos  Manuel,  the  Serrano  Indian  leader  who  was  responsible  for  holding the  tribe  together  during  difficult  times  in  1866, and  for whom  the  reservation was named. After  attending  Highland  Elementary  School and  St.  Boniface  Catholic  School  on  the Morongo  Indian  Reservation,  Martha  Manuel worked  in  any  job  she  could  find  as  a  young adult,  commuting  weekly  to  Los  Angeles  when she  couldn\u2019t  find  them  locally. She  became  a  tribal  leader  and  regularly traveled  to  the  state  capital  in  Sacramento  as a  spokesman  for  the  San  Manuel  Band.  Tribal members  give  her  credit  for  bringing  electricity to  the  reservation  in  the  last  1950s  and  running  water  to  tribal  homes  in  the  1960s.  Her strong  devotion  to  her  Serrano  ancestry,  culture  and  heritage  helped  the  San  Manuel Band  improve  its  quality  of  life  and  set  out  on the path  to  self-reliance. Martha  Manuel  Chacon  is  survived  by  her husband  of  nearly  60  years,  Raoul  Chacon, six  children,  18  grandchildren,  31  great-grandchildren and  four great great grandchildren. Mr.  Speaker,  words  do  not  begin  to  convey the  love  and  admiration  with  which  Martha Manuel  Chacon  was  held  by  her  family, friends,  and  supporters.  Her  life  journey stands  as  a  remarkable  testament  to  leadership,  courage,  strength  and  honesty  and  her memory  will  continue  to  inspire  countless  people.  It  is  only  appropriate  that  the  House  pay tribute  to  this  courageous woman  today. f THE  NEW  HOUSE  OF  WORSHIP  THE  JEWISH  FELLOWSHIP  HEMLOCK  FARMS FOR OF HON.  DON  SHERWOOD OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, April 11, 2000 Mr.  SHERWOOD.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like to  inform  my  colleagues  of  the  dedication  of  a new  house  of  worship  for  The  Jewish  Fellowship  of  Hemlock  Farms  which  will  be  celebrated  with  an  open  house  on  Sunday,  May 28, 2000,  from 1 p.m.  to 4 p.m. Hemlock Farms  is a private  four-season  recreational  community  in  the  heart  of  the  Pocono  Mountains  of  Pennsylvania.  Its  4,500 acres  include  state  forests,  lakes,  deer,  bears, tennis  courts,  indoor  and  outdoor  swimming pools,  a  club  house  with  a  fitness  center  and auditorium,  a  private  country  club  with  an  18hole  golf  course,  72  miles  of  paved  roads  and more  than  2,700  homes.  About  a  third  of  the population  are  year-round  residents.  The  others  who  spend  their  summers  or  weekends  in Hemlock  Farms  come  from  the  metropolitan areas  of  New  York,  New  Jersey,  Connecticut, and  other  areas  of  Pennsylvania.  They  include a growing number of  Jewish  residents. In  1971,  a  small  group  of  Jewish  residents met  to  form  The  Jewish  Fellowship  of  Hemlock  Farms.  Representing  the  heart  of  the Jewish  community  in  the  Poconos,  the  Fellowship  completed  the  religious  presence  of  the three  major  faiths  in  Hemlock  Farms.  The  Fellowship  flourished,  and  it  has  taken  an  active role  as  a member  of  the  Interfaith  Council.  For the  first  7  years,  services  were  held  in  members\u2019 homes and  community buildings. Rapidly  increasing  membership  made  possible  the  construction  of  its  first  permanent home  in  1980\u2014designed  to  seat  120.  By 1992,  the  membership  had  grown  to  more than  400.  The  happy  result  is  a  new  Jewish house  of  worship  and  community  center  designed  to  seat  more  than  500.  It  is  under  the full-time  leadership  of  Rabbi  David  Spritzer.  It is  significant  that  an  increasing  number  of VerDate 20<MAR>2000 05:25 Apr 12, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\A11AP8.035 pfrm04 PsN: E11PT1 ",

The  agreement  Mr.  Clinton  proposes would  not  permit  space-based  sensors; it would  not  permit  sufficient  numbers of  ground-based  radars;  and  it  would not permit additional defenses based on alternate  missile  interceptor  systems, such as naval or sea-based interceptors. All  of  these,  and  more,  are  absolutely necessary  to  achieve  a  fully  effective defense  against  the  full  range  of  possible threats to the American people. Mr.  Clinton\u2019s  proposal  is  not  a  plan to defend the United States; it is a plan to  leave  the  United  States  defenseless. It is, in fact, a plan to salvage the antiquated  and  invalid  U.S.-Soviet  ABM Treaty. That is what it is. No more. No less.  It  is  a  plan  that  is  going  nowhere fast in protecting the American people. After  dragging his  feet  on missile  defense  for  nearly  8  years,  Mr.  Clinton now  fervently  hopes  he  will  be  permitted in his final 8 months in office to tie  the  hands  of  the  next  President  of the  United  States.  He  believes  he  will be  allowed  to  constrain  the  next  administration  from  pursuing  a  real  national  missile  defense.  Is  that  what  he believes or even hopes? Well,  I,  for  one,  have  a  message  for President  Clinton:  Not  on  my  watch, Mr.  President.  Not  on  my  watch.  It  is not going to happen. Let\u2019s  be  clear,  to  avoid  any  misunderstandings  down  the  line:  Any modified  ABM  Treaty  negotiated  by this  administration  will  be  DOA\u2014dead on arrival\u2014at the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee,  of  which,  as  the Chair  knows,  I  happen  to  be  the  chairman. This  administration\u2019s  failed  security policies  have  burdened  America  and the  American  people  long  enough.  In  a few  months,  the  American  people  will go  to  the  polls  to  elect  a  new  President,  a  President  who  must  have  a clean  break  from  the  failed  policies  of this  administration.  He  must  have  the freedom and the  flexibility  to establish his own security policies. To  the  length  of  my  cable-tow,  it  is my  intent  to  do  everything  in  my power to ensure that nothing is done in the  next  few  months  by  this  administration  to  tie  the hands of  the next administration  in  pursuing  a  new  national  security  policy,  based  not  on scraps  of  parchment  but,  rather,  on concrete  defenses,  a  policy  designed  to protect  the  American  people  from  ballistic  missile  attack,  a  policy  designed to  ensure  that  no  hostile  regime\u2014from Tehran to Pyongyang to Beijing\u2014is capable  of  threatening  the  United  States of  America  and  the  American  people with nuclear blackmail. Any  decision  on  missile  defense  will be  for  the  next President  of  the United States to make, not this one. It is clear that  the  United  States  is  no  longer  legally  bound  by  the  U.S.-Soviet  ABM Treaty.  Isn\u2019t  it  self-evident  that  the U.S.-Soviet  ABM  Treaty  expired  when the  Soviet  Union,  our  treaty  partner, ceased to exist? Legally speaking, I see no  impediment  whatsoever  to  the United  States  proceeding  with  any  national  missile  defense  system  we\u2014the American  people  and  this  Congress\u2014 choose to deploy. That  said,  for  political  and  diplomatic  reasons,  the  next  President\u2014the next  President\u2014may  decide  that  it  is in  the  U.S.  interest  to  sit  down  with the  Russians  and  offer  them  a  chance to negotiate an agreement on this matter. Personally,  I  do  not  believe  a  new ABM  Treaty  can  be  negotiated  with Russia  that  would  permit  the  kind  of defenses  America  needs.  As  Henry  Kissinger  said  last  year  in  testimony  before  the  Foreign  Relations  Committee: Is it possible to negotiate a modification of the  ABM  Treaty?  Since  the  basic  concept  of the  ABM  Treaty  is  so  contrary  to  the  concept  of  an  effective  missile  defense,  I  find  it very difficult to imagine this. But I would be open to argument\u2014 And  let me  emphasize  these words  as Henry  Kissinger  emphasized  them when he said\u2014 provided  that  we  do  not  use  the  treaty  as  a constraint  on  pushing  forward  on  the  most effective  development  of  a  national  and  theater missile defense. Now  then,  like  Dr.  Kissinger,  I  am open  to  the  remote  possibility  that  a new  administration\u2014unencumbered  by the  current  President  of  the  United States  in his desperate desire  for a  legacy  and  this  administration\u2019s  infatuation  with  the  U.S.-Soviet  ABM  Treaty\u2014could enter into successful negotiations with the Russians. The  Republican  nominee  for  President,  Mr.  Bush  of  Texas,  has  declared that  on  taking  office  he  will  give  the Russians an opportunity  to negotiate a revised\u2014a  revised\u2014ABM  Treaty,  one that  will  permit  the  defenses  America needs. But Mr. Bush made  it  clear  that if  the  Russians  refuse,  he  will  go  forward nonetheless and deploy a national missile  defense.  And  good  for  him.  Mr. Bush  believes  in  the  need  for  missile defense,  and  he  will  negotiate  from  a position of strength. By  contrast,  President  Clinton  clearly  has  no  interest  whatsoever  in  missile defense. His agenda is not to defend America  from  ballistic  missile  attack but  to  race  against  the  clock  to  get  an arms  control  agreement\u2014any  agreement;  he  means  any  agreement\u2014that will  prevent  his  going  down  in  history as the first President in memory not to do so. So it is obvious, I think, that any negotiations  Mr.  Clinton  enters  into  in his final months will be from a position of desperation and weakness. For this administration\u2014after opposing missile defense for almost 8 years\u2014 to  attempt  at  the  11th  hour  to  try  to negotiate  a  revised  ABM  Treaty  is  too little, too late. This administration has long  had  its  chance  to  adopt  a  new  security  approach  to  meet  the  new threats and challenges of the post-coldwar  era. This  administration,  the  Clinton  administration,  chose  not  to  do  so. So  this  administration\u2019s  time  for grand treaty initiatives is clearly at an end.  For  the  remainder  of  this  year, the  Foreign  Relations  Committee  will continue its routine work. We will consider  tax  treaties,  extradition  treaties, and  other  already-negotiated  treaties. But  we  will  not  consider  any  new  lastminute  arms  control  measures  that this  administration may  negotiate  and cook  up  in  its  final,  closing  months  in office. As  the chairman of  this committee,  I make  it  clear  that  the  Foreign  Relations  Committee  will  not  consider  the next administration bound by any treaties this administration may  try to negotiate in the coming 8 months. The  Russian  Government  should  not be  under  any  illusion  whatsoever  that any  commitments  made  by  this  lameduck  administration will  be  binding  on the  next  administration.  America  has waited  8  years  for  a  commitment  to build  and  deploy  a  national missile  defense.  We  can  wait  a  few  more  months for  a  new  President  committed  to doing it\u2014and doing it right\u2014to protect the American people. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr.  President,  we  have a  great  opportunity  ahead  of  us.  Next week,  the  Senate  will  begin  floor  debate  on  the  Education  Opportunities Act\u2014a  bill  that  will  help  America\u2019s children  by  improving  the  quality  of their education. While education policy  is primarily a local and State responsibility, the Federal  Government  does  have  a  role  to play.  I  am  looking  forward  to  discussing  just  what  the  Federal  Government  can  do  to  improve  the  quality  of the education our children receive. Few things  are more  important  to  our  children\u2019s  future  than  the  quality  of  their education. Every  child  in  this  country,  regardless  of  race,  economic  status,  or  where that  child  lives,  deserves  the  opportunity  for  a  quality  education.  Yet  far too  many  children,  especially  in  our inner cities and Appalachia, simply are not  getting  the  quality  education  they deserve. We need more good teachers. We need safer  schools.  We  need  college  access for  all  students  who  want  to  go  to  college.

Mr.  SCHUMER.  Mr.  President,  I thank  the  Senator  for  her  answer,  and I  simply  make  three  points.  Before  I do,  I  want  to  refer  to  a  letter  from Chief  Justice  Rehnquist  in  opposition saying that a statute would be far preferable  to  a  constitutional  amendment. This letter is to Judy Clarke, President of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. I will read it: I have received the letter of March 21, commenting  on  various  measures  pending  in Congress  relating  to  the  judiciary. The Judicial Conference has recently taken a position in  favor  of  making  provision  for  victims\u2019 rights  by  statute,  rather  than  by  constitutional  amendment;  this  would  have  the  virtue  of  making  any  provisions  in  the  bill which  appeared mistaken  by  hindsight  to  be amended by a simple act of Congress. second. Senator It makes the very point. The Senator admitted that negotiations are still ongoing. We are debating a constitutional amendment  that  must  be  passed  by two-thirds  of  each  Chamber  and  then three-quarters  of  the  States.  We  are still debating the language. Mrs.  FEINSTEIN.  Will  the  permit me to respond? Mr.  SCHUMER.  I  will  in  one  I want to finish my statement. First, the kind of definitions that the Senator  has  talked  about  of  appeals procedures  has  never  been  in  the  U.S. Constitution.  In  fact,  what  happened before  is  there  would  be  a  two-  or three-line  sentence  that  the  rights  of victims  should  be  protected,  and  then we would work out by statute what the details were. I  have  never  seen  a  constitutional amendment  such  as  this.  It  is  the  21st century.  I  agree  with  that.  But  that doesn\u2019t  mean  the  elegance  of  thought and language in the Constitution of the 18th  century  should  be  thrown  out  the window, and we are doing that here. I  ask  the  Senator,  why,  if  she  believes  in  a  constitutional  amendment with  a  two-  or  three-line  amendment talking  about  victims\u2019  rights,  would she  not  be  far  more  in  keeping  with constitutional thought and theory than a  15-page  document  which  clearly  is written  in  statutory  and  not  constitutional language? Second, if the detailed definitional  language  that  the  Senator is  talking  about  works,  it  will  work  as a statute. The  reason  the  Oklahoma  City  case didn\u2019t  work  is  the  statute  was  poorly drafted,  at  least  in  terms  of  what  the Senator  is  saying.  I  will  have  more  to say  about  that  later.  I  don\u2019t  want  to occupy her time on  this, but  if  the  language  works  as  a  constitutional amendment,  the very  language  that we have  before  us  admittedly  being  rephrased  or  redrafted,  why  doesn\u2019t  it work as a statute? The problem that  is pointed to  in the Oklahoma  City  case  is  not  the  amendment. If the very same language were a constitutional  amendment,  God  forbid, it  still  wouldn\u2019t  have  been  applied  be(Mr. as  a why SCHUMER\u2019s  cause  the  judge  didn\u2019t  throw  it  out  on an  unconstitutional  basis.  He  basically ignored  it, which meant  it wasn\u2019t  clear enough. No.  1,  do  we  have  any  amendment  in the  Constitution  that  compares  in  detail  and  outlines  procedurally  what  we have here? No.  2,  if  this  language  works  constitutional  amendment,  wouldn\u2019t it work as a statute? No.  3,  if  a  constitutional  amendment is  necessary,  although  again  it  has  not been thrown out by the Supreme Court, or  any  lower  court,  why  wouldn\u2019t  we have a  simple, elegant  three-line statement  talking  about  the  rights  of  victims, and then let the details of legislative engineering be worked out  in  statute as it has been done in this country, regardless  of  whether  Democrats,  Republicans,  Whigs,  or  Free-Soilers,  or anybody else has been in charge? I  thank  the Senator  for  her  patience. I feel as passionately on our side as she does on her side. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am going to defer to  the  distinguished  Senator  from  Arizona  to  give  the  opening  response,  and then  I  would  like  to  finish  up,  if  I might. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  HAGEL). The Senator from Arizona. Mr.  KYL.  Mr.  President,  before  she arrived at noon, I had shared some specific comments that go directly to Senator  questions.  I  thought  I would  repeat  what  I  said  here  in  brief. The  first  objection  is  that  this  is  too wordy. It is not 15 pages. It is about 21\u20445 pages.  But  the  total  number  of  words that describe victims\u2019 rights is 179. The total  number  of  words  in  the  amendment,  except  for  the  technical  provisions  regarding  the  effective  date,  is 307.  If  you  add  them  all  up,  it  is  394 words.  Again,  179  of  those  words  describe  the  victims\u2019  rights.  The  defendants\u2019  rights  consume  348  words  in  the U.S. Constitution. The Bill of Rights  is 462  words.  If  you  add  it  up  word  for word,  we  win,  as  I  said  this  morning. But  that,  obviously,  is  hardly  a way  to evaluate. Mr.  SCHUMER.  It  shouldn\u2019t  be  21\u20445 pages,  it  should  be  21\u20445 lines  in  keeping with  the  way  the  Constitution  is  written. Mr.  KYL.  That  is  the  second  point. We  are  criticized  on  two  accounts.  We literally  can\u2019t  win.  On  one  hand,  the Senator  from  New  York  and  others have  said  it  is  subject  to  interpretation.  What  does  \u2018\u2018reasonable\u2019\u2019  mean? On the other hand, we have written too much.  We  ought  to  just  say  \u2018\u2018reasonable  rights\u2019\u2019  and  then  flesh  it  out  in statute. We  can\u2019t win,  if  that  is  the argument. What  we  have  done,  I  submit,  is  the compromise that the Founding Fathers did.  They  expressed  general  terminology  in  order  to  keep  it  short  and succinct,  understanding  that  it  would have  to  be  fleshed  out.  But  what  we have  done  is  to  describe  in  enough  additional  detail  to  ensure  that  there could never be a contention that we are infringing  on  a  defendant\u2019s  rights  and to be  sure  there would never be a criticism  that  we  weren\u2019t  specific  enough about  what  these  rights  were.  So  we have  actually  enumerated  these  eight specific  rights.  But  I  think  we  have struck  the  right  compromise  in  that regard. Two other quick points, if I may: The Senator  correctly  pointed  out  that  it appears  one  of  the  reasons  for  the judge\u2019s  decision  in  the  Oklahoma  City bombing  case  was  that  he  just  ignored it.  I  think  it  is  hard  to  figure  out  exactly  why  he  didn\u2019t  apply  it.  He couldn\u2019t  ignore  a  U.S.  constitutional provision  as  he  could  ignore  a  Federal statute, which is precisely why we need a  Federal  constitutional  amendment. It may also be  that  the Oklahoma City statute  was  not  well  enough  drafted.  I think that is exactly correct as well. It is  no  answer  to  say  that  a  statute would  be  the  way  to  go  here,  that  it  is better  than  a  constitutional  provision. The  bottom  line  is  this:  In  words somewhat  similar  to  those  words  that protect  the  rights  of  the  accused,  we have  identified  eight  specific  rights.  I have  yet  to  see  anybody  say  those eight  specific  rights  should  not  be guaranteed.  Rather,  the  argument  is that they should be put in statute. Senator SCHUMER has  just pointed out why putting it in statute doesn\u2019t work. Mr.  SCHUMER.  If  the  Senator  will yield,  I  think  this  should  be  a  debate that  goes  on  for  some  time.  That  is what  we  are  having  here  as  opposed  to everyone making speeches periodically. I  very much  appreciate  that  and would be  happy  when  I  come  to  the  floor  to yield  time  to  opponents  of  the  bill  to continue this debate. But  I  would  simply  say  to  my  good friend  from  Arizona  that  a  statute  is no  less  the  law  of  the  land  than  a  constitutional  amendment.  The  idea  that a  constitutional  amendment  should  be taken  into  account  more  than  a  statute  doesn\u2019t  hold  up  in  terms  of  jurisprudence. I am sure even my good, mistaken  friend  in  this  case,  Larry  Tribe, would  agree  with  that.  But  for  whatever  reason,  one  judge  ignores  a  statute.  The  Senator  is  right.  It  is  murky. It  is  hard  to  figure  out  why.  We  then leap  to  a  constitutional  amendment, one  with  almost  as  many  words  as  the entire  Bill  of  Rights.  It  doesn\u2019t  make any sense to me. I ask  the Senator: Because a  judge  in Oklahoma  City,  a  case  I  care  very much  about,  ignored  statutory  language,  why  don\u2019t  we  try  once  again? Why  don\u2019t  we  try,  whether  that  case was  on  appeal,  or  in  another  way,  to make sure that judges can\u2019t? You could easily  write  a  statute  that  says  the right  of  allocution  is  not  granted.  You can\u2019t  proceed  with  sentencing.  If  some judge  somewhere\u2014I  doubt  there  would be  one\u2014should  refuse  to  apply  that law,  you  would  win  on  appeal,  pardon my saying,  in a  \u2018\u2018New York minute.\u2019\u2019 A constitutional  amendment  doesn\u2019t  give any  more  authority  for  a  judge  to apply  than a  statute.

Hamilton  was  30.  The  tall  man with  the  peg  leg,  Gouverneur  Morris, was  35.  Madison  was  36.  They  were young  in  years,  but  they  had  tremendous experience back of those years. So  the  Constitution  carries  with  it the  lessons  of  the  experiences  of  the men  who  wrote  it.  They  were  steeped in  the  classics.  They  were  steeped  in ancient  history.  They  knew  about Polybius.  They  knew  how  he  wrote about  mixed  government.  They  knew what Herodotus had to say about mixed government.  They  knew  what  other great Greek and Roman authors of history  had  learned  by  experience,  centuries  before  the  18th  century.  They knew  about  the  oppression  of  tyrannical English monarchs. They knew the importance  of  the  English  Constitution,  of  the  Magna  Carta,  of  the English  Bill  of  Rights  in  1689.  They knew  about  the  English  Petition  of Right in 1628. All of these were parts of the English Constitution,  an unwritten Constitution  except  for  those  documents,  some  of  which  I  have  named\u2014 the  Petition  of  Right,  the  Magna Carta,  the  decisions  of  English  courts, and English statutes. So  to  stand  here  and  say,  in  essence, that the Constitution reflects the viewpoints  of  the men who wrote  that  Constitution  in  1787,  or  only  reflects  the views  of  our  American  predecessors  of 1789,  or  those  who  ratified  the  Constitution  in  1790  or  in  1791,  is  only  a partial  truth.  The  roots  of  this  Constitution\u2014a copy of which I hold in my hand\u2014go  back  1,000  years,  long  before 1787,  long  before  1791  when  the  first  10 amendments  which  constitute  the American  Bill  of  Rights  were  ratified. That  was  only  a  milestone  along  the way\u20141787,  1791.  These  were  mere  milestones along the way to the real truths, the  real  values  that  are  in  this  Constitution,  a  copy  of which  I  hold  in my hand.  Those  are  only  milestones  along the  way,  far  beyond  1787,  far  beyond 1776  or  1775  or  1774. Why was  that  revolution  fought?  Why  did  our  forbears take  stand  there  on  the  field  of  Lexington,  on  April  19,  and  shed  their blood?  Why  was  that  revolution fought?  It  was  fought  on  behalf  of  liberty.  That  is  what  this  Constitution  is all  about\u2014liberty,  the  rights  of  a  free people,  the  liberties  of  a  free  people. Liberty,  freedom  from oppression,  freedom  from  oppressive  government,  that is  why  they  shed  their  blood  at  Lexington and at Bunker Hill and at Kings Mountain  and  at  Valley  Forge,  down through  the  decades  and  the  centuries. The  blood  of  Englishmen  was  spilled centuries earlier  in the  interests of  liberty,  in  the  interests  of  freedom:  Freedom  of  the  press,  freedom  to  speak, freedom  to  stand  on  their  feet  in  Parliament  and  speak  out  against  the King,  freedom  from  the  oppression  of the  heavy  hand  of  government. That  is what that Constitution is about. There  are  those  who  think  that  the Constitution  sprang  from  the  great minds  of  those  39  men  who  signed  the Constitution  at  the  Convention,  of  the 55  who  attended  the  meetings  of  the Convention\u2014some  believe  that  it sprang  from  their  minds  right  on  the spot.  Some  believe  that  it  came,  like manna  from  Heaven,  fell  into  their arms.  It  sprang  like  Minerva  from  the brain of Jove. That  is what they think. No,  I  say  a  miracle  happened  at Philadelphia, but that was not the miracle.  The  miracle  that  occurred  at Philadelphia  was  the  miracle  that these  minds  of  illustrious  men  gathered at a given point  in  time, at Philadelphia,  and  over  a  period  of  116  days wrote  this  Constitution.  It  could  not have  happened  5  years  earlier  because they  were  not  ready  for  it.  Their  experiences  of  living  under  the  Articles  of Confederation  had  not  yet  ripened  to  a point  where  they  were  ready  to  accept the fact that there had to be a new government,  a  new  constitution  written. And  it could not have happened 5 years later  because  the  violence  that  they saw  in  France,  as  the  guillotine claimed life after life after life, had not yet  happened.  Some  5  years  later,  they would  have  seen  that  violence  of  the French  Revolution,  and  they  would have recoiled in horror from it. The writing of  this Constitution happened  at  the  right  time,  at  the  right place,  and  it  was  written  by  the  right men. That was  the miracle of Philadelphia. Here  we  are  today  talking  about amending  it,  this  great  document,  the greatest  document  of  its kind  that was ever  written  in  the  history  of  the world.  There  is  nothing  to  compare  it with,  by  way  of  man-made  documents. Who  would  attempt  to  amend  the  Ten Commandments  that  were  handed down  to  Moses?  Not  I.  Yet,  we,  little pygmies  on  this  great  stage,  before  the world, would attempt to pit our talents and our wisdom against the talents and wisdom,  the  experience  and  the  viewpoints  of  men  such  as  George  Washington,  James  Madison,  Alexander Hamilton,  Gouverneur  Morris,  Benjamin  Franklin,  John  Dickenson, James Wilson, Roger Sherman? In article V of this Constitution, they had the foresight  to  write  the  standard.  If  we want  to  find  the  standard  for  this  Constitutional  amendment,  or  any  other Constitutional  amendment  here  is  the standard in the Constitution itself. The  Congress, whenever  two-thirds  Houses shall deem it necessary\u2014 of  both The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary\u2014 shall propose Amendments. . . . I  don\u2019t  say  that  the  Constitution  is static.  I  don\u2019t  say  it  never  should  be amended.  I  would  vote  for  a  constitutional  amendment  if  I  deemed  it  \u2018\u2018necessary.\u2019\u2019  Certainly,  I  do  not  see  this proposed  amendment  as  necessary,  but I  will  have  more  to  say  about  that later. I  don\u2019t  say  that  the  Constitution  is perfect.  I  do  say  that  there  is  no  other comparable document in the world that has  ever  been  created  by  man.  And when  that  Constitution  uses  the  word \u2018\u2018necessary,\u2019\u2019  it means  \u2018\u2018necessary,\u2019\u2019 because no word in that Constitution was just  put  into  that  document  as  a  place filler. I do think this  is a time that  I might speak  a  little  about  the  constitutionalism  behind  the  American  Constitution.  I  think  it  might  be  well  for anyone  who  might  be  patient  enough or  interested  enough,  to  hear  what  I am  going  to  say,  because  I  don\u2019t  think enough  people  understand  the  Constitution.  I  am  sure  they  don\u2019t  understand  the  roots  of  the  Constitution. They  don\u2019t  understand  American  constitutionalism.  It  is  a  unique  constitutionalism,  the  American  constitutionalism.  I  don\u2019t  think  most  people understand it. In  response  to  a  recent  nationwide poll,  91  percent  of  the  respondents agreed  with  this  statement:  \u2018\u2018The  U.S. Constitution is important to me.\u2019\u2019 Mr.  President,  91  percent  of  the  respondents  agreed  to  that:  \u2018\u2018The  U.S. Constitution  is  important  to  me.\u2019\u2019  Yet only  19  percent  of  the  people  polled knew  that  the  Constitution  was  written  in  1787;  only  66  percent  recognized the  first  10  amendments  to  the  Constitution  as  the  Bill  of  Rights\u2014only  66 percent.  Only  58  percent  answered  correctly  that  there  were  three  branches of  the  Federal  Government;  17  percent were  able  to  recall  that  freedom  of  assembly  is  guaranteed  by  the  first amendment  to  the  Constitution\u201417 percent,  17  percent.  Yet  you  see  them out  here  all  the  time,  on  the  Capitol steps,  assembling,  petitioning  the Government for a redress of what they conceive to be grievances. They know they have  that  right,  but  only  17  percent were  able  to  recall  that  freedom  of  assembly  is  guaranteed  by  the  first amendment to the Constitution. Only  7  percent  remembered  that  the Constitution  was  written  at  the  Constitutional  Convention;  85  percent  believed  that  the  Constitution  stated that  \u2018\u2018All  men  are  created  equal\u2019\u2019\u2014or failed  to  answer  the  question;  and  only 58  percent  agreed  that  the  following statement  is  false:  \u2018\u2018The  Constitution states  that  the  first  language  of  the U.S. is English.\u2019\u2019 The  American  people  love  the  Constitution.  They  believe  the  Constitution  is  good  for  them  collectively  and individually,  but  they  do  not  understand much about it. And the same can be  said  with  respect  to  constitutionalism.  The  same  can  be  said  with respect  to  the  Members  of  Congress; that  means  both  Houses.  Not  a  huge number, I would wager, of the Members of  the  Congress  of  both  Houses  know  a great deal about the Constitution. How many  of  them  have  ever  read  it  twice? Each  of  us  takes  an  oath  to  support and  defend  the  Constitution  of  the United  States  every  time  we  are  elected  or  reelected.

This  method  of  choosing  the  President may have been suggested from the manner of choosing Senators under the Constitution of Maryland. An  examination  of  these  early  State constitutions  clearly  indicates  a  vast wealth  of  knowledge  concerning  constitutional  principles  and  a  gradual evolution  leading  up  to  the  convention based  on  the  experience  gained  from the  administration  of  governments under  the  new  State  constitutions.  I see  the  constitutions  of  the  States  as tributaries\u2014tributaries\u2014to  a  mighty stream  of  American  constitutionalism flowing  to  the  mighty  ocean  of  events that  culminated  in  the  grand  handiwork of the framers at the 1787 Convention. Between the completion of State constitutions  and  the  Philadelphia  Convention  that  produced  the  United States  Constitution  stood  the  Articles of Confederation which went into effect on  March  1,  1781,  from  the  substance and  experience  of  which  Madison  and Hamilton  and  Franklin  and  others  at the  Convention  gained  so  much  guidance. Let  us  now  turn  our  attention  Articles of Confederation. Mr.  President,  I  see  others  on  the floor. They may wish to speak. I will be happy  to yield  the  floor at  this point  if I  can  regain  it  later  and  continue  my statement. Mr.  LEAHY.  Mr.  President,  I  say  to my  friend  from  West  Virginia,  I  have already  been  on  this  floor  speaking  for a  couple  days.  I  took  a  moment  to  go back  to  the  office.  But  I  was  watching the  Senator  on  the monitor,  and  I  just wanted  to  come  over  and  listen  to  him in  person.  I  have  no  intention  of  wanting  to  ask  him  to  yield  the  floor.  I  appreciate the courtesy he has offered. Mr.  BYRD.  I  thank  the  distinguished Senator. I  see  the  Senator  from  California. Also,  if  she  wishes  to  have  the  floor,  I will be happy to yield it for a while. Mrs.  FEINSTEIN.  I  appreciate  the courtesy  of  the  distinguished  Senator from West Virginia. I say to the Senator, please, continue on and conclude. I am  just  fine. I enjoy listening. Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. Mr.  President,  what  impact  did  the Articles  of  Confederation  have  upon the  Constitution  of  the  United  States? On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia  introduced  a  resolution  in  the Continental Congress resolving: the to  That  these  United  Colonies  are,  and  of right  ought  to  be,  free  and  independent states,  that  they  are  absolved  from  all  allegiance  to  the British Crown, and  that all political  connection  between  them  and  the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved. That  is  expedient  forthwith  to  take  the most  effectual  measures  for  forming  foreign alliances. That  a  plan  of  confederation  be  prepared and  transmitted  to  the  respective  colonies for their consideration and approbation. In  accordance  with  this  resolution, Congress  appointed  a  committee  of  12 on  June  12\u2014which  happens  to  be  my lovely  wife\u2019s  birthday,  June  12,  although  she  does  not  go  that  far  back\u2014 1776,  to  prepare  a  form  of  confederation.  A  month  later,  on  July  12,  a draft  plan  was  reported  by  the  committee,  written  by  John  Dickinson  of Delaware.  The  document,  although  reported  to  Congress  on  August  20,  was delayed  in  its  final  consideration,  and after  having  undergone  modifications, was  finally  approved  by  the  last  holdout  State  of  Maryland  in  February 1781,  and  the  Congress,  then,  first  met under  the  Articles  of  Confederation  on March 1, 1781. It had been a long time aborning. New  Jersey,  Delaware,  and  Maryland had demanded that the States that had large  claims  to western  lands  renounce them  in  favor  of  the  Confederation. Maryland  was  the  last  State  to  ratify the  Articles,  but  finally  went  along when  she  became  satisfied  that  the western  claims  would  become  the  expected treasure of the entire Nation. The  Articles  of  Confederation  were the  direct  predecessor  of  the  Constitution of the United States, and the Articles  contained  within  themselves  the fatal flaws which doomed the success of the  confederation.  It  was  a  \u2018\u2018league  of friendship\u2019\u2019 only, of which the Congress was  the  unique  organ  and  in  which \u2018\u2018each  state  shall  have  one  vote.\u2019\u2019  The votes  of  nine  States  were  required  before  important  action  could  be  taken by  Congress,  and  the  consent  of  the legislature of each State was necessary to  any  amendment  of  the  fundamental law. Congress  was  given  no  commercial control  and,  most  unfortunately,  no power  to  raise  money,  but  could  only make  requisitions  on  the  States  and then  hope  and  pray  that  the  States would  respond  affirmatively  and  adequately.  They  seldom  if  ever  did.  Control  over  foreign  affairs  was  vested  in Congress,  but  it  was  without  means  of making the States obey treaty requirements. The Congress had responsibility but  without  power  to  carry  out  its  responsibility.  It  dealt  with  the  people, not  individually,  but  over  their  heads through the States. Several  efforts  were  made  to  get  the States to amend the articles, by adding the  right  to  levy  import  duties,  but these  efforts  failed  because  it  was  impossible  to  get  the  unanimous  consent of  the  legislatures  of  the  13  States  to any  amendment  of  the  fundamental law. It became increasingly difficult to secure  a  quorum  of  attendance  in  Congress,  and  even  when  a  quorum  of Members  attended,  important  measures  were  blocked  by  the  requirement for  the  votes  of  nine  States.  A  State frequently  lost  its  single  vote\u2014that  is all  it  had\u2014because  of  differences among  its  delegates.  It  was  a  time  of experimentation,  of  learning  a  hard lesson  that  would  be  remembered.  But the  experience  gained  from  learning these  hard  lessons  helped  to  prepare the  way  for  a  better  national  government.  It  should  also  be  remembered that at least one substantial act of legislation\u2014the  ordinance  for  the  government  of  the  Northwest  Territory,  was created  by  the  government  under  the Articles of Confederation. Under  the  Articles  of  Confederation, no  State  could  be  represented  in  Congress  by  less  than  two,  nor  by  more than  seven,  members;  and  no  person could serve as a delegate for more than three  years  in  any  term  of  six  years. There  were  limited  terms.  Each  State had  only  one  vote.  All  charges  of  war and  other  expenses  incurred  for  the common  defense  or  general  welfare,  if allowed  by  the  United  States  in  Congress  assembled,  were  to  be  defrayed out of a common treasury, which would be  supplied  by  the  several  States  in proportion  to  the  value  of  all  lands within  each  State,  and  the  taxes  for paying  a  State\u2019s  proportion  were  to  be laid  and  levied  by  the  authority  of  the legislatures  of  the  several  States  within  the  time  agreed  upon  by  the  Congress. Under  a  very  complex  arrangement\u2014 I say to the former Attorney General of the  State  of  Alabama,  who  presently presides  over  this  august  body\u2014the Congress  under  the  Confederation  was denominated  as  the  last  resort  on  appeal  in  all  disputes  and  differences arising  between  two  or  more  States \u2018\u2018concerning  boundary  jurisdiction  or any other cause whatever.\u2019\u2019 The  business  of  Congress  was  to  be carried  on  during  a  recess  by  \u2018\u2018a  committee  of  the  states,\u2019\u2019  to  consist  of  one delegate from each State. When  it  came  to  the  armed  forces, requisitions were to be made from each State  for  its  quota,  in  proportion  to the  number  of  white  inhabitants  in such States, which  requisitioned would be  binding.  Each  State  would  appoint the  regimental  officers,  raise  them  in and  clothe  and  arm  and  equip  them  at the expense of the United States. However,  if  the  Confederation  Congress  should  determine,  based  on  circumstances,  that  any  State  should raise  a  smaller  number  than  its  quota and that any other State should raise a greater  number  of  men  than  its  quota called  for,  the  extra  number  was  to  be raised,  clothed,  and  equipped  as  the quota allowed, unless the  legislature of that State should judge that such extra number could not be safely spared. The State  would  be  permitted  to  raise  \u2018\u2018as many  of  such  extra  number\u2019\u2019  as  the State judged could be safely spared. What  a  flawed  approach!  It  is  little wonder  that  George  Washington,  as Commander  in  Chief  of  the  Revolutionary  forces,  was  constantly  frustrated  in  his  efforts  to  build  an  effective  fighting  force.  It  was  almost  a miracle  that  the  fledgling Nation managed to carry on and win the war under such  conditions,  but  we  can  only  guess VerDate 26-APR-2000 03:38 Apr 27, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G26AP6.105 pfrm02 PsN: S26PT1 ",

I  quote  from  the  NOW  and Education Fund: Defense Legal  While  many  women  are  victims  of  violent crime,  women  are  also  criminal  defendants. Self-defense  cases,  dual  arrest  situations,  or the  abuse  of  mandatory  arrest  and  mandatory  prosecution  policies  by  batterers  who allege  abuse  by  the  victim,  exemplify  contexts  in which women victimized by violence may  need  the  vital  constitutional  protections afforded defendants. There  is a whole question of how this gets  implemented,  what  happens  to these  women  and  children.  Given  the fact this is a big part of my work in the Senate,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that this  NOW  Legal  Defense  Fund  position paper be printed in the RECORD. There  being  no  objection,  the  material  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the RECORD, as follows: NOW LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATION FUND, New York, NY, April, 2000. POSITION STATEMENT ON PROPOSED RIGHTS AMENDMENT VICTIMS\u2019 Legislators  in  the  106th  Congress  plan  to introduce  a  proposal  to  amend  the U.S.  Constitution  by  adding  a  \u2018\u2018Victims\u2019  Rights Amendment.\u2019\u2019  Because  NOW  Legal  Defense and Education Fund  (NOW LDEF)  chairs  the National  Task  Force  on  Violence  Against Women,  and,  as  an  organization  that  works extensively  on  behalf  of  women  who  are  victims  of  violent  crime,  including  our  fight against  domestic  violence,  sexual  assault, and  all  forms  of  gender-based  violence,  we have been asked to analyze this proposal. NOW  LDEF  agrees  with  sponsors  of  victims\u2019 rights legislative initiatives that many survivors  of  violent  crime  suffer  additional victimization  by  the  criminal  justice  system.  We  appreciate  the  injustices  and  the physical  and  emotional  devastation  that drives  the  initiative  for  constitutional  protection.  Nonetheless,  we  do  not  agree  that amending  the  federal  Constitution  is  the best strategy for improving the experience of victims as they proceed through the criminal prosecution and trial against an accused perpetrator.  Any  such  amendment  raises  concerns  that  outweigh  its  benefits.  After  considering the potential benefits and hardships, and  particularly  considering  the  circumstances  of  women  who  are  criminal  defendants,  NOW  LDEF  cannot  endorse  a  federal constitutional amendment elevating the legal  rights  of  victims  to  those  currently  afforded  the  accused.  However,  we  fully  endorse  companion  efforts  to  improve  the criminal  justice  system,  including  initiatives to ensure consistent enforcement of existing  federal  and  state  laws,  and  enactment and  enforcement  of  additional  statutory  reform  that  provide  important  protections  for women  victimized  by  gender-based  violence. The  need  to  improve  the  criminal  justice  system\u2019s  response  to  women  victimized  by  violence It  is  true  that  survivors  of  violence  often are pushed to the side by the criminal justice system.  They  may  not  be  informed  when  judicial  proceedings  are  taking  place  or  told how  the  system  will  work.  Although  many jurisdictions are working on  improving  their interactions with victims, many victims still experience  the  judicial  system  as  an  ordeal to be endured, or as a forum from which they are  excluded. They often  experience a  loss of control  that  exacerbates  the  psychological impact  of  the  crime  itself.  Certainly  women victimized  by  violence  face  the  persistent gender  bias  in  our  criminal  justice  system, which  includes  courts  and  prosecutors  that fail  to prosecute  sexual assault, domestic violence,  and  other  forms  of  violence  against women as vigorously as other crimes. All too often,  criminal  justice  officials  blame  the victims  for  \u2018\u2018asking  for  it\u2019\u2019  or  for  failing  to fight  back  or  leave.  these  negative  experiences  make  it  more  difficult  for  women  victimized by violence to recover from the trauma  and may  contribute  to  reduced  reporting and  prosecution  of  violent  crimes  against women. As  amendment  proponents  have  stressed, increased  efforts  to  promote  victims\u2019  rights potentially  could  have  a  strong  and  positive impact  on  women  who  are  victims  of  crime. The  entire  public  relations  and  educational campaign  mounted  on  behalf  of  the  amendment  can  be  very  informative.  Criminal  justice  system  reform  can  give  victims  a  greater  voice  in  criminal  justice  proceedings  and could  increase  their  control  over  the  impact of  the  crime  on  their  lives. For  example,  notice  of  and  participation  in  court  proceedings,  including  the  ability  to  choose  to be  present  and  express  their  views  at  sentencing,  could be psychologically healing  for victims. More  timely  information  about  release  or escape  and  reasonable  measures  to  protect the victim  from  future stalking and violence could  improve women\u2019s  safety. Women  could benefit  economically  from  restitution.  Nevertheless,  because  statutory  protections  and state  constitutional  provisions  already  may provide  some  or  all  of  these  improvements, because  additional  statutory  and  state-level reform  can  be  enacted,  and  because  no  reform  will  be  effective  absent  strict  enforcement,  we  do  not  support  a  federal  constitutional  amendment  to  address  the  problems facing women crime victims. Why  a  Federal  Victims\u2019  Rights  amendment is problematic Supporters of a federal victim\u2019s rights constitutional amendment begin with the fundamental  premise  that  survivors  of  violence deserve  the  same  protections  that  our  judicial  system  affords  to  an  accused  perpetrator,  and  that  their  interests  merit  equal weight  in  the  eyes  of  the  state.  They  urge amending  the  U.S.  Constitution  to  balance treatment  of  victims  and  defendants,  positing  that  other  protections,  whether  granted  by  statute,  or  implemented  through  policy,  custom,  training  or  education,  could  be limited  at  some  point  by  the  rights  guaranteed  to  defendants  under  the  Fourth,  Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments to the federal Constitution.  However,  adding  constitutional  protections  that  could  offset  the  fundamental constitutional protections afforded defendants  marks  a  radical  break  with  over two hundred years of  law and  tradition  carefully balancing the rights of criminal defendants against the exercise of state and federal power against them.1 It is our belief that the proposed  reforms  can  be  afforded  under  statutes  and  state  constitutions.  The  constitutional  amendment  proposal  contains  complex  requirements  that  are  far  better  suited for statutory reform. The  position  of  a  survivor  of  violence  can never  be  deemed  legally  equivalent  to  the position of an individual accused of a crime.2 The  accused\u2014who  must  be  presumed  innocent,  and  may  in  fact  be  innocent\u2014is  at  the mercy  of  the  government,  and  faces  losing her  liberty,  property,  or  even  her  life  as  a consequence.  While  the  crime  victim  may have suffered grievous  losses, she, unlike the defendant, is not subject to state control and authority.  A  victims\u2019  rights  constitutional constitutional Footnotes at end of statement. amendment  could  undercut  the  constitutional  presumption  of  innocence  by  naming and  protecting  the  victim  as  such  before  the defendant  is  found  guilty  of  committing  the crime. Amendment proposals leave undefined numerous  questions  ranging  from  the  definition  of  a  \u2018\u2018victim\u2019\u2019  to whether  victims would be  afforded  a  right  to  counsel,  or  how  victims\u2019  proposed  right  to  a  speedy  trial  would be  balanced  against  defendants\u2019  due  process rights.  Proposals  also  inject  an  additional party  (the  victim  and  her  attorney),  to  the proceedings  against  a  defendant  as  a  matter of  right,  increasing  the  power  of  the  state and potentially diminishing the rights of the accused, particularly in the eyes of a jury. The  demonstrated  existing  inequalities  of race  and  class  in  the  modern  American criminal  justice  system  only  increase  the importance of defendants\u2019 guaranteed rights. Affording alleged and actual  crime victims a constitutional  right  to  participate  in  criminal  proceedings  could  provide  a  basis  for challenge  to  those  bedrock  principles  that assure justice and liberty for all citizens. While  many  women  are  victims  of  violent crime,  women  are  also  criminal  defendants. Self-defense  cases,  dual  arrest  situations,  or the  abuse  of  mandatory  arrest  and  mandatory  prosecution  policies  by  batterers  who allege  abuse  by  the  victim,  exemplify  contexts  in which women victimized by violence may  need  the  vital  constitutional  protections  afforded  defendants.  These  cases  highlight  the  need  for  constitutional  protection for  criminal  defendants  belonging  to  groups historically subject to discrimination. Proposed  alternatives  to  address  the  needs  women victimized by violence NOW LDEF supports efforts to improve the experience  of  victims  in  the  criminal  justice process.  Many  statutes  and  state  constitutions  already  contain  the  reforms  contained in  amendment  proposals.  Additional  mechanisms  for  change  include  enhanced  implementation  and  enforcement  of  existing  state and  federal  legislation,  enacting  new  statutory  protections,  increased  training  for  judicial,  prosecutorial,  probation,  parole  and  police personnel, and improved services for victims  such as  the more widespread use of victim-witness  advocates.  Funding  available under  the  Violence  Against  Women  Act  can continue  to  be  directed  to  crucial  training and  victims\u2019  services  efforts.  Additional statutory  reform  and  funding  for  program implementation,  particularly  targeted  to eliminate  gender  bias  in  all  aspects  of  the criminal  justice  system  can  go  a  long  way toward  assisting  women  who  have  survived crimes of violence. Statutory  reform  requiring  prosecutors and other criminal justice system officials to take  such  measures  as  requiring  timely  notice to victims of court proceedings are modest  and  relatively  inexpensive  steps  that would have a great impact. We must work to provide  better  protection  for  victims\u2014 through  consistent  enforcement  of  restraining  orders,  and  by  training  law  enforcement officials and judges about rape, battering and stalking, so that arrest and release decisions accurately reflect the potential harm the defendant  poses.  NOW  LDEF  hopes  the  attention drawn to this issue will promote greater dialogue  about  the  problems  that  victims face  in  the  criminal  justice  system,  and  will increase  the  criminal  justice  system\u2019s  responsiveness to women victimized by gendermotivated violence. of 1 FOOTNOTES Reported  litigation  under  state  constitutional amendments  is  limited, but  illustrates the potential conflicts  in  balancing  the  rights  of  victims  and  the rights  of  the  defendants.

On  the  night  of  April  29,  1900,  Casey departed  Memphis  aboard  Engine  382 with  six  passenger  cars  one  hour  and thirty-five  minutes  late.  Protocol  demanded  that  engineers  make  their  arrival time regardless of the tardiness of their  departure.  Casey  was  renowned throughout the region for his ability to make  time,  and  he  was  doing  an  excellent  job  until  he  arrived  at  Vaughn Station,  only  eleven  miles  from  his final  destination.  While  attempting  to maintain  his  scheduled  arrival,  Casey missed  a  flag  signal  warning  that  a freight  train  was  still  on  the  tracks ahead  of  him.  Casey\u2019s  engine  collided with  the  caboose,  but  instead  of  abandoning  his  engine  as  instructed,  he stayed  behind  in  the  hope  that  the lives  of  his  passengers  could  be  saved. Due  to  Casey\u2019s  heroic  attempts  to  stop and slow the train, none of Casey\u2019s passengers  were  injured  and  he  was  the only one killed in the crash. Throughout  this  year,  Casey  Jones\u2019 hometown  of  Jackson,  Tennessee,  will celebrate  the  centennial  of  his  gallant ride  and  recognize  his  contributions  to American  history.  The  events  will  culminate on  the anniversary of  the  crash with  a  celebration  sponsored  by  the Casey  Jones  Village,  the  Casey  Jones Home  and  Railroad  Museum,  and  the City  of  Jackson.  I  encourage  everyone to  take  part  in  these  events  and  remember  the  legacy  of  Casey  Jones\u2014an American folk hero.\u2022 f ARIAIL  PULITZER  NOD \u2022 Mr.  HOLLINGS.  Mr.  President,  it  is an  honor  for  me  to  recognize  one  of South  Carolina\u2019s  most  talented  journalists,  Robert  Ariail,  who  was  recently  selected  as  one  of  the  three  finalists  for  the  Pulitzer  Prize  in  editorial  cartooning.  This  is  the  second time  he  has  made  the  Pulitzer shortlist,  having  also  been  a  1995  finalist.  Since  joining  The  State  newspaper in  Columbia,  SC  in  1984, Mr.  Ariail  has informed  and  charmed  South  Carolina readers  with  a  collection  of  original, insightful  and  finely-crafted  cartoons. Having  been  a  subject  of  his  satire,  I can  personally  attest  to  his  talent. His work  has  earned  him  numerous  national and international awards including  the  Overseas  Press  Club\u2019s  Thomas Nast  Award,  the  National  Headliner Award  and  the  national  Sigma  Delta Chi  Award.  I  have  faith  that  three times  will  be  the  charm  for  Robert Ariail and the Pulitzer; this prestigious award could not go to a more deserving person.\u2022 f THE  150TH  BIRTHDAY  OF  GRAND RAPIDS,  MICHIGAN \u2022 Mr.  ABRAHAM. Mr.  President,  I  rise today  in  honor  of  the  City  of  Grand Rapids,  Michigan,  which  on  May  1, 2000,  will  celebrate  its  150th  birthday. Residents  of  the  city have  been  invited to  commemorate  the  occasion  with Mayor John Logie at  the Grand Rapids Sesquicentennial Community Party, an event  which  will  highlight  the  growth and  development  of  a  city  that  is  still on the ascent. When  a  group  of  fur  trappers,  explorers,  loggers,  and  sod  busters  took  a break  from  their  daily  activities  on May  1,  1850,  to  make  Grand  Rapids  an incorporated  city,  the  estimated  population was 2,686 persons. The number of square miles that the city encompassed stood  at  four,  the  estimated  number  of city  officials  was  sixteen,  there  were thirty  two  miles  of  road  within  city limits,  and  there  was  neither  a  police force nor a fire department. To be sure, the  first  mayor  of  Grand  Rapids,  Mr. Henry  R.  Williams,  had  his  work  cut out for him. Today, I think Mr. Williams would be extremely proud to see how far the city of  Grand  Rapids  has  come  in  its  150 years.  Its  population  now  stands  at 192,000  persons,  and,  when  surrounding metropolitan  areas  are  added  to  this, the  figure  grows  to  1,021,200.  This makes Grand Rapids the second largest city  in  Michigan  and  the  58th  largest city  in  the  Nation.  The  city  encompasses  45  square  miles,  employs  over 2,000  city  officials,  has  562.81  miles  of road within  its  limits,  a  police  force  of 379 officers and a fire department of 260 firefighters.  Mr.  President,  I  think  it goes  without  saying  that  Mayor  Logie also has a lot of work on his hands. The  City  of  Grand  Rapids  has planned  many  events  to  be  included  as part  of  its  Sesquicentennial  Celebration.  All  elementary  schools,  public, private,  and  charter,  will  be  served birthday  cake  on  May  1.  The  original city boundary will be marked with special  historic  1850  signs.  City  officials have  commissioned  the  designing  of  a parade  float  to  participate  in  area  parades,  which  depicts  the  Grand  River and is fully equipped with jumping fish, fireworks,  and  depictions  of  historic buildings  and  neighborhoods.  Free coloring  books  entitled  \u2018\u2018The  City  of Grand  Rapids:  Then  and  Now,\u2019\u2019  will  be distributed on April 29, 2000. In  addition,  officials  from  the  four sister  cities  of  Grand  Rapids\u2014 Omihachiman,  Japan;  Bielsko-Biala, Poland; Perugia, Italy; and Ga District, Ghana\u2014will  join  in  the  celebration.  A time  capsule,  to  be  built  into  the  new Archive  Center,  will  receive  its  first items.  One  hundred  and  fifty  trees will be  planted  throughout  the  community to  commemorate  the  birthday  celebration.  A  beginning  list  of  150  historical sites  in  Grand  Rapids  will  be  released on April  29,  2000,  and will  be  completed throughout  the  year.  And  finally,  the Grand  Rapids  Press  will  publish  four essays,  submitted  by  Grand  Rapids residents,  as  a  tribute  to  the  birthday, with  the  topics  of  these  essays  ranging from  diversity  to  the  city\u2019s  quality  of life. Mr.  President,  in  one  hundred  and fifty  years,  residents  of  Grand  Rapids have  experienced  their  fair  share  of both prosperity and decline. At the end of  World  War  II,  the  future  of  Grand Rapids  looked  bleak.  Through  the  incredible efforts of thousands of individuals  in  the  years  since,  though,  the city  has  managed  to  turn  the  tables full  tilt.  As  we  enter  the  new  millennium,  Grand  Rapids  is  enjoying  the greatest  economic  boom  in  its  history. With  this  economic  prosperity  has come  a  remarkable  turn  in  the  overall quality  of  life  that  residents  enjoy. Also,  it  should  be  noted  that  Grand Rapids  is  one  of  Michigan\u2019s  most  diverse  cities,  diversity  which  increases everyday  as  more  and  more  jobs  are created  within  city  limits.  The  turnaround  of  Grand  Rapids  serves  as  a model, and an  inspiration, to other cities, not only  in Michigan, but  throughout the Nation. Mr.  President,  I  extend  greetings  to all  those  participating  in  the  Grand Rapids  Sesquicentennial  Community Party,  and  the many  other  events  that have  been  planned  for  the  celebration of the anniversary. On behalf of the entire  United  States  Senate,  I  wish  the City  of  Grand  Rapids  a  happy  150th birthday.\u2022 f DIABETES  RESEARCH \u2022 Mr.  WYDEN.  Mr.  President,  as  a member of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I  am  concerned  with  the  need  for  further  research  for  a  cure  for  diabetes. Recently,  I  had  several  meetings  with constituents  from  Portland,  Eugene, and  Lake  Oswego,  Oregon  concerning diabetes  research  funding.  All  of  these constituents  are  young  children  or young  adults  living  with  this  disease. One young woman told me that she has already  lost  three  friends  to  this  disease. For  fiscal  year  2000,  the  National  Institutes of Health (NIH) received a $13.3 million  increase  over  last  year\u2019s  funding  for  diabetes.  This  increase  brings the  total  amount  for  diabetes  research to $462.3 million. For those who have to live  every  day  with  diabetes  and  for those  who  are  the  parents  of  a  child living  with  disease,  and  who  have  to worry  every  day  about  the  long-term toll  diabetes  disease  takes  on  their child, this is not enough. Diabetes  can  destroy  nerves,  harm eyesight, and cause a host of other deleterious  effects  on  the  body.  While  I am  pleased  that  there  was  an  increase in  the  funding  of  NIH  for  diabetes  research  last  year,  I  believe  we  can  and should  do  more  to  assure  that  we  find a cure. While funding has increased from $134 million  in  fiscal  year  1980,  this  only represents  approximately  2  percent growth  per  year  when  adjusted  for  inflation. Considering the widespread and devastating  effects  of  this  disease,  we should  continue  to  support  the  funding increases  for  NIH  research  of  diabetes. I  know  that  many  of  my  colleagues feel  strongly  about  this  issue  as well.

By Mr. WELLSTONE: S.  2465.  A  bill  to  amend  the  Internal Revenue Code  of  1986  to  deny  tax  benefits  for  research  conducted  by  pharmaceutical  companies  where  United States  consumers  pay  higher  prices  for the products of that research than consumers  in  certain  other  countries;  to the Committee on Finance. PRESCRIPTION PRICE EQUITY ACT OF 2000 Mr.  WELLSTONE.  Mr.  President,  I rise  to  introduce  legislation  today,  the Prescription  Drug  Price  Equity  Act  of 2000. My colleague, PETE STARK, a Representative  for  the  State  of  California in  the  House  of  Representatives\u2014I want  to  give  him  full  credit  for  having introduced  this  legislation  in  the House.  I am proud  to be a partner with him. The  long  and  the  short  of  it  is  this bill  amends  the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986 to deny tax benefits for research conducted  by  pharmaceutical  companies  where  U.S.  consumers  pay  higher prices  for the products of that research than  consumers  in  certain  other  countries,  such  as  Canada.  I  could  go  into this  in  great  detail,  but  I  think  the operational  definition  is  of  5  percent more. I  tell  you  right  now,  in  my  State  of Minnesota,  seniors  and  others  are  in  a state of outrage by the fact they can go and  buy  the  same  drug\u2014produced  in this  country,  FDA  approved\u2014for  half the price in another country. If we are going to be giving  these  tax benefits  to  these  pharmaceutical  companies,  I  think  they  are  going  to  have to  be  more  concerned  about  the  very public  that  gives  them  these  benefits. So I introduce this legislation and look forward to support from my colleagues. Mr.  President,  like  the  rest  of  my colleagues  I  have  just  returned  from  a week  in  my  home  State  of  Minnesota. I  met  with  many  constituents,  but none  with  more  compelling  stories than senior citizens struggling to make ends  meet  because  of  the  high  cost  of prescription  drugs\u2014life-saving  drugs that  are  not  covered  under  the  Medicare program. Ten or 20 years ago these same  senior  citizens  were  going  to work  everyday\u2014in  the  stores,  and  factories,  and  mines  in  Minnesota\u2014earning  an  honest  paycheck,  and  paying their  taxes  without  protest.  Now  they wonder,  how  can  this  Government\u2014 their  Government\u2014stand  by,  when  the medicines they need are out of reach. The  unfairness  which  Minnesotans feel  is  exacerbated  of  course  by  the high  cost  of  prescription  drugs  here  in the United States\u2014the same drugs that can  be  purchased  for  frequently  half the  price  in  Canada  or  Mexico  or  Europe.  These  are  the  exact  same  drugs, manufactured  in  the  exact  same  facilities  with  the  exact  same  safety  precautions.  A  year  ago,  most  Americans did  not  know  that  the  exact  same drugs  are  for  sale  at  half  the  price  in Canada.  Today,  you  can  bet  the  pharmaceutical  industry  wishes  no  one knew  it. But the cat  is out of the bag\u2014 and  it  is  time  for Congress  to  right  the inequities  that  are  rife  in  the  way  the United  States  government  interacts with the pharmaceutical industry. Today,  I  want  to  focus  on  one  of those inequities\u2014the subsidies that the United  States  Government  offers  to pharmaceutical  manufacturers  to  develop  drugs  which  these  same  companies  proceed  to  sell  to  the  American people  at  up  to  twice  the  price  they charge  in  other  countries.  To  combat that  problem  I  am  introducing  today the  Prescription  Price  Equity  Act  of 2000,  a  bill  to  deny  research  tax  credits to  pharmaceutical  companies  that  sell their  products  at  significantly  higher prices  in the U.S. as compared to other industrialized countries. The  need  for  this  bill  is  clear.  The U.S.  Government  provides  lucrative tax  credits  to  the  pharmaceutical  industry  in  this  country  in  order  to  promote  research  and  development  of  new lifesaving  pharmaceutical  products. Yet,  in  return  for  these  government subsidies,  the  drug  companies  charge uninsured Americans the highest prices for  drugs  paid  by  anyone  in  the  world. The  Congressional  Research  Service recently  completed  an  analysis  of  the tax  treatment  of  the  pharmaceutical industry.  That  analysis  concluded  that tax  credits  were  a  major  contribution to  lowering  the  average  effective  tax rate  for  drug  companies  by  nearly  40 percent  relative  to  other  major  industries from 1990 to 1996. Specifically, the report  found  that  while  similar  industries  pay  a  tax  rate  of  27.3  percent,  the pharmaceutical  industry  is  paying  a rate  of  only  16.2  percent.  At  the  same time,  after-tax  profits  for  the  drug  industry  averaged  17  percent\u2014three times  higher  than  the  5  percent  profit margin of other industries. It  is  time  for  the  pharmaceutical  industry  to  earn  these  tax  benefits\u2014by offering  their  life  saving  drugs  to America\u2019s  seniors  at  the  same  prices they charge in other countries. Numerous  studies  have  shown  that uninsured seniors pay exorbitant prices for  pharmaceuticals.  Surveys  done  by the  Minnesota  Senior  Federation  on the  prices  of  the  most  commonly  used drugs  by  Medicare  beneficiaries  found that in Minnesota, seniors pay on average  about  twice  the  price  that  Canadian  seniors  just  across  the  border  pay for  the  exact  same  medication.  I  know that  the  House  Government  Reform Committee  compared  prices  of  prescription  drugs  in  the  numerous  districts  around  the  country  with  the prices  of  prescription  drugs  in  Canada. Those  comparisons  found  price  differentials  in  the  exact  same  ballpark that  we  found  in  Minnesota.  It  is  no wonder  that  Minnesota  seniors  are willing  to  spend  their  time  and  money to  go  across  the  border  to  buy  their prescription  medications.  And  the same  is  happening  all  over  New  England,  in  the  Dakotas,  in  Montana,  in Washington state, and elsewhere. Yet,  at  the  same  time  that  seniors are  being  asked  to  pay  these  outrageous  prices,  the  drug  companies  are reaping  the benefit of generous governmental  subsidies.  There\u2019s  something wrong  with  a  system  that  gives  drug companies  huge  tax  breaks  while  allowing  them  to  price-gouge  seniors. The  Prescription  Price  Equity  Act  of 2000  attempts  to  correct  this  glaring inequity  in  a  very  even-handed  approach.  The  message  to  pharmaceutical  companies  is  this:  So  long  as your  company  gives  U.S.  consumers  a fair  deal  on  drug  prices  as  measured against the same products sold in other OECD  countries,  you  will  continue  to qualify  for  all  available  research  tax credits.  But  if  your  company  is  found to be fleecing American taxpayers with prices  higher  than  those  charged  for the  same  product  sold  in  other  industrialized  countries,  like  Japan,  Germany,  Switzerland,  or  Canada,  then you  become  ineligible  for  those  tax credits. I  know  that  the  pharmaceutical  industry,  through  its  trade  association, PhRMA,  will  oppose  the  Prescription Price  Equity  Act  and  will  claim  that the  bill  means  the  end  of  pharmaceutical  research  and  development. That  is  complete  nonsense.  As  shown by  Congressional  Research  Service, drug  industry  profits  are  already  three times  higher  than  all  other  major  industries.  This  legislation  doesn\u2019t change  the  current  system  of  research tax  credits  at  all  unless  drug  companies  refuse  to  fairly  price  their  U.S. products.  This  bills  intent  is  by  no means to reduce the U.S. Government\u2019s role  in  promoting  research  and  development. It is simply to make clear that in  return  for  such  significant  government  contributions  to  their  industry, drug  companies  must  treat  American consumers  fairly.  Is  there  any  reason why  U.S.  tax  dollars  should  be  used  to allow drug prices to be reduced in other highly  developed  countries,  but  not here at home as well? Of course there is no good reason for that. That  is  why  this  bill  simply  tells PhRMA  that  U.S.  taxpayers  will  no longer subsidize low prices in the OECD countries  with  our  tax  code.  Research and development  is  important and that is  why  we  give  these  huge  tax  breaks, but  that  research  and  development does little good for U.S. consumers who can\u2019t afford to buy the products of that research. This  bill  does  not  solve  the  biggest underlying  problem  that  America\u2019s senior citizens  face. Only a comprehensive,  prescription  drug  benefit,  available  to  and  affordable  by  all  Medicare beneficiaries will  do  that.  I  have  introduced  and  cosponsored  legislation  that can  make  that  happen.  But  this  bill, the  Prescription  Price  Equity  Act, nonetheless,  sends  an  important  message.  It  makes  clear  that  the  priority of  the  Federal  Government  in  subsidizing research and development is to make  sure  that  the miracles of modern medicine that result are at least equally  available  to  American  citizens  as VerDate 26-APR-2000 03:38 Apr 27, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G26AP6.043 pfrm02 PsN: S26PT1 ",

INCREASED  AUTHORIZATION  MINIDOKA PROJECT, IDAHO. FOR Section  5  of  the  Act  of  September  30,  1950 (chapter  1114;  64  Stat.  1085),  authorizing  appropriations for the north side pumping division  of  the  Minidoka  reclamation  project, Idaho,  is  amended  by  striking  \u2018\u2018$11,395,000\u2019\u2019 and inserting \u2018\u2018$14,200,000\u2019\u2019. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Pursuant  to  the  rule,  the  gentleman  from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON) and the gentleman from  California  (Mr.  each will control 20 minutes. The  Chair  recognizes  the  from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON). gentleman MILLER) GEORGE GENERAL LEAVE Mr.  SIMPSON.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask unanimous  consent  that  all  Members may  have  5  legislative  days  within which  to  revise  and  extend  their  remarks on H.R 3577. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Is  there objection  to  the  request  of  the  gentleman from Idaho? There was no objection. Mr.  SIMPSON.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3577  is  a  bill  to  increase  the amount authorized  to be appropriated  for  the  north  side  pumping division  of  the  Minidoka  reclamation project in Idaho. A&B Irrigation is the contracting entity  for  the  north  side  pumping  division  of  the Minidoka  project.  The  division, located on the southern portion of the  State  of  Idaho,  consists  of  some 80,000  acres.  Construction  of  the  division  was  completed  in  1959  and  control was  transferred  to  the  district  in  1966. Due  to  the  lack  of  natural  surface drainage  outlets  to  the  Snake  River and  constraints  associated  with  the drainage  onto  the  lower-lying Minidoka Irrigation District, most irrigation  return  flows  and  stormwater runoffs  are  injected  into  drain  wells which  are  part  of  the  original  project design. The  drain  wells  pass  the  water  directly  into  the  underlying  aquifer.  In 1991,  the  United  States  Environmental Protection Agency designated the eastern  Snake  River  plain  aquifer  a  sole source of drinking water. Under  provisions  of  the  Federal  Safe Drinking Water Act,  if  a  sole  source  of drinking  water  is  contaminated  it could  result  in  a  significant  public health  hazard.  In  an  effort  to  comply with  the  Act,  the  district  and  the  U.S. Bureau  of  Reclamation  developed  a plan to dispose of this runoff. The  remaining  work  consists  of  constructing  passive  treatment  and  reuse systems  at  an  estimated  cost  of  $2.8 million,  of  which  up  to  $1.3  million would  be  reimbursable  to  the  district under  a  cost-sharing  arrangement,  60 percent  U.S.  Federal  Government,  40 percent irrigation, A&B irrigation. As  of  now,  42  of  the  original  78  drain wells  have  been  closed  or  abandoned, but  36 wells  are  still  active. This  legislation  would  amend  the  original  language  to  increase  the  authorization  by $2.8  million  from  $11,395,000  to $14,200,000. In  the  energy  and  water  appropriations  bill  for  the  fiscal  year  2000, money  was  appropriated  for  the  district to continue capping these wells in order  to  comply  with  the  Federal  Safe Drinking  Water  Act.  Unfortunately, the ceiling was hit and no further funding  could  be  used.  By  increasing  the ceiling,  the  district  will  be  able  to complete its project, which in turn will help  prevent  the main  source  of  drinking  water  from  south  central  Idaho from being contaminated. Mr. Speaker, I ask that all colleagues support H.R. 3577. Mr.  GEORGE  MILLER  of  California. Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  myself  such  time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  the  gentleman  from Idaho  (Mr. SIMPSON)  has  quite  properly explained  this  legislation  to  increase the  spending  ceiling  for  the  north  side pumping  division  of  the  Minidoka project  in  Idaho  by  $2,805,000.  This  increase would allow work already begun under  the  Minidoka  north  side  drain water  management  plan  to  be  completed. We  need  to  protect  the  underground drinking  water  supplies  in  this  area  of the Snake River plain because they are threatened  by  contaminated  irrigation drain  water.  I  would  urge  all  members of  the  committee  to  support  this  legislation.  The  administration  has  testified in support of this legislation and it is not controversial. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr.  SIMPSON.  Mr.  Speaker,  back the balance of my time. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  The question  is  on  the  motion  offered  by the  gentleman  from  Idaho  (Mr.  that  the  House  suspend  the  and pass the bill, H.R. 3577. The question was taken. Mr.  GEORGE  MILLER  of  California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Pursuant  to  clause  8  of  rule  XX  and  the Chair\u2019s  prior  announcement,  further proceedings  on  this  motion  will  be postponed.

Mr.  Speaker,  I  move to  suspend  the  rules  and  agree  to  the concurrent  resolution  (H.  Con.  Res.  89) recognizing  the  Hermann  Monument and  Hermann  Heights  Park  in  New Ulm,  Minnesota,  as  a  national  symbol of  the  contributions  of  Americans  of German heritage. The Clerk read as follows: H. CON. RES. 89 Whereas  there  are  currently  more  than 57,900,000  individuals  of  German  heritage  residing  in  the  United  States,  who  comprise nearly  25  percent  of  the  population  of  the United  States  and  are  therefore  the  largest ethnic group in the United States; Whereas  those  of  German  heritage  are  not merely  descendants  of  one  political  entity, but of all German speaking areas; Whereas  numerous  Americans  of  German heritage  have  made  countless  contributions to  American  culture,  arts,  and  industry,  the American  military,  and  American  government; Whereas  there  is  no  recognized  tangible, national symbol dedicated to German Americans  and  their  positive  contributions  to  the United States; Whereas  the  story  of  Hermann  the Cheruscan  parallels  that  of  the  American Founding Fathers,  because he was  a  freedom fighter  who  united  ancient  German  tribes  in order  to  shed  the  yoke  of  Roman  tyranny and  preserve  freedom  for  the  territory  of present-day Germany; Whereas  the  Hermann  Monument  located in  Hermann  Heights  Park  in  New  Ulm,  Minnesota, was  dedicated  in  1897  in  honor  of  the spirit  of  freedom  and  later  dedicated  to  all German  immigrants who  settled  in New Ulm and elsewhere in the United States; and Whereas  the  Hermann Monument  has  been recognized  as  a  site  of  special  historical  significance  by  the  United  States  Government, by  placement  on  the  National  Register  of Historic Places: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by  the House of Representatives  (the That  the  Hermann MonuSenate  concurring),  ment  and  Hermann  Heights  Park  in  New Ulm,  Minnesota,  are  recognized  by  the  Congress  to  be  a  national  symbol  for  the  contributions  of Americans  of German  heritage.

The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Is  there objection  to  the  request  of  the  gentleman from Idaho? There was no objection. Mr.  SIMPSON.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.

And  I think  those are  the  reasons why  I have gotten  involved.  It  has  taken  me  a longer  time  to  learn  that  than  she has. But  since  1993,  I  have  been  listening,  I have  been  meeting,  I  have  been  listening,  I  have  been  talking,  I  have  been trying to find out. Now what we have is one  last  plea  on  my  part  on  behalf  of the black farmers. My  statement  of  January  8  was  we cannot proceed any further without my colleagues  in  Congress  being  supportive  of  this  effort.  If  we  vote  this concurrent  resolution  down,  we  are going to be changing it from legislative remedies to political, and I beg my colleagues not to do that. These black  farmers have not,  in any way,  done  anything  to  deserve  this,  to be  considered  a  political  football,  that someone has to be of a certain party or had to be a certain type of person to be able  to  bring  something  like  this.  It  is a  legislative  matter.  It  is  brought  so that  we  can  show  concurrence.  That  is what it is. I plead with my colleagues to let this pass  so  that  we  can,  at  least,  say  we are  in  unity  with  the  black  farmers. And  then  we  can  go  forward  from there.  If  we  take  it  away  from  that, from  being  legislative,  and  we  make  it political  and  say,  no,  sir,  we  are  not going to do this because somebody may get  credit  or  can  blame  somebody  else, then the black farmers are going to get a  no  in  the  same  way  that  they  have been  getting  noes  for  years  and  years and years. A no is a no, no matter what we say to it. I  think  it  would  be  a  real  disservice to  their  commitment  and  to  their  sacrifice  for  us  to  say  no  to  them  again.  I plead  with  my  colleagues  to  vote  for this resolution. Mr.  WATTS  of  Oklahoma.  Mr.  Speaker, today  the  House  will  be  considering  House Concurrent  Resolution  296,  a  resolution  expressing  the  sense  of  Congress  that  the  settlement  process  for  discrimination  claims brought  by  African-American  farmers  against the Department  of  Agriculture  be  carried  out  in a  timely and expeditious manner. The  Secretary  of  Agriculture  has  conceded that  the  Department  of  Agriculture  discriminated  against  certain  African-American  farmers  in  the  delivery  of  payments  from  the  Commodity  Credit  Corporation  and  disaster  assistance  programs  during  the  period  from  1981 through  1996.  This  discrimination  has  had  a significant  impact  on  the  lives  and  economic well-being  of  these  African-American  farmers and  their  families. A  Federal District Court  Judge  ruled  in  April, 1999,  that  these  African-American  farmers,  as a  result  of  this  discrimination,  are  entitled  to settlement  from  the  Department  of  Agriculture. However,  even  a  year  later,  these  claims  have not  been  addressed  by  the  Department  of  Agriculture  in  a  timely  manner.  These  settlements  are  desperately  needed  and  much-deserved.  The  Court-mandated  funds  will  help these  farmers  recover  their  losses  due  to  this discrimination  and  provide  them with  the  financial means  to get back on  their  feet. I  rise  in  strong  support  of  this  resolution  and I would  like  to  thank Representative DICKEY for his  efforts  to  ensure  that  these  claims  are dealt  with  fairly  and  expeditiously.  I  ask  my colleagues  in  the  House  to  join  me  in  urging the  Department  of  Agriculture  to  expedite  the settlement  process  and  commit  the  necessary resources  to assist  these  farmers. Mr.  DICKEY.  Mr.  Speaker,  back the balance of my time. yield I  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE DICKEY),  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.

But  a  short  time  later  there  was Kargil. Kargil  is  the name  of  a  town  in Kashmir under India\u2019s jurisdiction near the  line  of  control  that  separates  the areas controlled by India and Pakistan. In May of 1999, Pakistani-backed forces crossed  that  line  and  attacked  India\u2019s defensive  positions  near  Kargil.  This bold  gambit  by  Pakistan  was  not  successful  militarily.  Ultimately,  it proved  to  be  even  more  of  a  disaster militarily  for Pakistan, and the United States  urged  Pakistan  to  withdraw  its forces  back  to  its  side  of  the  line  of control.  Our  government  refused  to  go along  with  Pakistan\u2019s  bid  to  strengthen  its  position  by  internationalizing the  crisis  by  trying  to  get  the  United States  to  step  in  as  a  mediator  in  the bilateral dispute. What  little  was  left  of  the  \u2018\u2018Spirit  of Lahore,\u2019\u2019  Madam  Speaker,  was  further eroded  last  October  when  a  military coup  in  Pakistan  removed  the  civilian government  from  power  and  threw Prime Minister Sharif in jail. In  a  recent  interview  with  an  international  news  service,  our  Assistant Secretary  of  State  for  South  Asian  Affairs, Karl  Inderfurth,  said  that  a  solution  to  the  Kashmir  project  must  be homegrown  and  not  exploited  from  the outside.  Mr.  Inderfurth  expressed  that the  State  Department  was  trying  to move  away  from  the  old  days  when there  was  typically  a  pro-Pakistan  tilt in  U.S.  policy  in  the  region,  to  a  more even-handed approach for working with both of the major South Asian nations. But he  stated,  and  I  quote,  \u2018\u2018Right now we  have  more  opportunities  to  pursue with  India,  and,  frankly,  right  now  we have many more concerns about the direction  Pakistan  is  heading.\u2019\u2019  He  also expressed  hope  that  Pakistan  would take  concrete  steps  that  would  allow  a productive  and  serious  dialogue  to  be resumed with India. Madam  Speaker,  I  would  stress  that the  most  helpful  concrete  step  that Pakistan  could  take would  be  to  do  all in  its  power  to  end  the  cross-border terrorism  that has  caused  so much  suffering  to  the  people  of  Kashmir,  Hindu and  Muslim  alike.  While  India  has made  clear  its  willingness  to  negotiate in  good  faith  with  Pakistan,  India  also has  to  maintain  a  vigilant  defensive posture  for  as  long  as  the  Pakistanisupported  cross-border  terrorism  continues. Madam Speaker,  I believe  that President  Clinton\u2019s  recent  trip  to  South Asia,  which  I  had  the  opportunity  to take  part  in,  has  played  a  significant role  in  helping  to  reduce  tensions  and hostility  between  Pakistan  and  India. As  Secretary  Inderfurth  said,  \u2018\u2018The President\u2019s visit has changed the terms of  the  relationship  between  the  United States  and  India,  the  world\u2019s  two  largest  democracies.\u2019\u2019  The  President  made it  clear  to  both  India  and  Pakistani leaders that the U.S. would be happy to work  with  both  countries  as  friends  to try  to encourage dialogue, but  it  is not our  place  to  dictate  the  terms  of  the peace process in Kashmir much less the outcome. The  great  thing  about  the  Lahore process is that it rose as a bilateral initiative  between  India  and  Pakistan. The  key  for  breathing  life  into  the  bilateral Lahore declarations is for Pakistan  to  accept  India\u2019s  outstretched hand.  And  so  far,  unfortunately,  Pakistan  has  been  sending  somewhat mixed signals. Meanwhile, Madam Speaker, we have seen how  dangerous  the Kashmiri militant  movement,  which  is  supported  by Pakistan,  has  become.  Over  the  weekend  we  heard  from  one  of  the  militant leaders,  Mushtaq  Ahmed  Zargar,  who was  one  of  the  three  militants  freed last  December  by  the  Indian  government  in  exchange  for  freeing  the  innocent  hostages  being  held  in  the  hijacked  Indian  Airlines  plane.  According to a news account from the AP, Mr. Zargar  dismissed  the  idea  of  negotiations  with  India,  promising  to  stay  on the  path  of  jehad,  or  holy  war.  He threatened  punishment  for  any  Kashmiri  who  opened  talks  with  India.  And this,  unfortunately,  is  the  true  face  of the  so-called  freedom  movement  in Kashmir. 2015 Mr. Speaker, by taking steps towards negotiation,  Pakistan  could  help  to isolate  and  undercut  these  terrorist groups  operating  in  Kashmir.  So  far, Pakistan  has  done  just  the  opposite, actively  supporting  the  terrorists.  But at  some  point,  I  hope  that  the  Pakistani  leadership  will  recognize  that that  strategy  is  increasingly  turning Pakistan into a pariah state. If  and  when  Pakistan  changes  its course,  and  I  hope  it  will  soon,  they will  find  a willing  negotiating  party  in India  and  a  supportive  friend  in  the United  States.  I  just  hope  that  we  can resume  the  India-Pakistan  dialogue  in the  \u2018\u2018spirit  of  Lahore\u2019\u2019  as  soon  as  possible. AND VIETISAKSON)  GUTKNECHT).  COMMEMORATING  MEN  WOMEN  WHO  FOUGHT  IN  NAM  WAR The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. Under  a  previous  order  of the House, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  is  recognized  for  5  minutes. Mr.  ISAKSON.  Mr.  Speaker,  yesterday,  May  7,  a  celebration  of  sort,  a commemoration  of  sort,  took  place  in all 50 States in this country as we commemorated  the  25th  anniversary  of  the end of the Vietnam War. Between  1958  and  1975,  over  8  million Americans,  228,000  of  whom  were  Georgians,  fought  in  Southeast  Asia  on  behalf  of  freedom  against  communism and  totalitarianism.  That  was  the  war of  my  generation.  It  was  the  legacy that I remember. America was divided throughout that war  and  remains,  in  some  cases,  divided  today  over  whether  we  should have  been  there  and  our  resolve  was never what it should have been. But tonight,  I  rise  not  to  debate  that,  but  to commemorate the men and women who fought and died on behalf of the United States  of  America,  58,000  of  them,  2,042 who  remaining  missing  in  action today. While  we  debate  the  positive  nature of  issues  we  believe  in  and  condemn others  today  in  contemporary  times, we  must  continue  to  pause  and  reflect on the sacrifice made on behalf of all of us. To  that  end,  I  want  to  commend  five individuals  from Georgia, Susie Ragan, who  founded  the  MIA/POW  force  in Georgia  and  now  has  moved  to  Maryland  and  is  doing  the  same  thing  so we do  not  forget  those  2,042;  Tommy Clack,  a  triple  amputee  who  returned to  a  divided  America  and  has  committed  the  rest  of  his  life  to  see  to  it that  Vietnam  veterans  get  the  attention and services that they deserve and their  Government  promised;  Ron  Miller, who served as the  former executive director  of  the  Georgian  Veterans Leadership  Program;  and  Colonel  Ben Purcell  of  Georgia,  a  member  of  the Georgia  legislature,  but  25  years  ago  a man  who  ended more  than  8  years  as  a prisoner  of  war,  over  5  in  solitary  confinement. We  must  never  forget  the  sacrifice made  by  those men  and  women  for  our Nation  and  for  our  country  and  the duty  and  honor  and  commitment  they made  to  this  country  and  to  their God. And  that  fifth  person  to  me  is  a  person  by  the  name  of  Jack  Elliott  Cox. Jack died  in Vietnam  in  1968. But Jack was  a  volunteer.  He  volunteered  when we  graduated  from  college  to  go  to OSC.  And  like  70  percent  of  those  who died in Vietnam, he was not drafted, he was a volunteer. In  fact,  what  is  so  often  not  talked about  is  that  25  percent  of  those  who fought  were  drafted,  75  percent  were people  who  volunteered  for  the  service in  a  divided  war  and  a  divided  time. But  they  were  committed  to  their country. Let us not  forget the Jack Coxes, the Susie  Ragans,  the  Tommy  Clacks,  the Ron  Millers,  and  the  Ben  Purcells, those  who  fought  and  live  today  to fight  on  for  the  veterans  of  that  war, and those who died for you and I. As  Members  of  this  Congress,  when we  go  to  the  26th  anniversary  next year,  may  it  be  a  time  that  we  continue  our  commitment  to  the  veterans of  the  United  States  of  America  and the  men  and  women  who,  regardless  of conflicts  at  home,  fought  and  served and,  in  some cases, died  for  their country,  for  our Nation,  and  for  those  of  us here tonight.

FIRE  TIPPETT The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Under the Speaker\u2019s announced policy of January  6,  1999,  the  gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. WELDON) is recognized for 60 minutes. Mr.  WELDON  of  Pennsylvania.  Mr. Speaker, a terrible tragedy occurred on Friday of last week. The District of Columbia  fire  chief  resigned  his  position. I  have  known  Tom  Tippett  for  a  number  of  years.  I  have  come  to  respect him  and  admire  him,  as  do  all  of  those firefighters, men and women, who serve in  local  36  of  the D.C. Fire Department Union. Tom  Tippett  is  a  true  firefighter.  I first met him about 12 years ago, shortly  after  I  first  came  to  Congress  and decided  to  try  to  work  the  issues  involving fire and life safety in this country.  To  create  a  better  awareness among  our  colleagues  about  the  role  of the firefighter in our inner-city areas, I started  a  tradition  that  each  year would  take  our  colleagues  on  a  volunteer  basis  and  have  them  run  with  one of the busiest D.C. fire stations. Mr.  Speaker,  one  of  those  nights  we assigned  a  group  of  Members  to  run with  Tom  Tippett\u2019s  station,  a  truck company  and  a  rescue  company  that was  at  that  time  the  busiest  station  in D.C.  As  Members  of  Congress  in  their jeans  and  shirts,  with  their  running gear  assigned  by  the  Department,  sat in  the  station  talking  to  firefighters and  responded  throughout  the  evening to  drug  dealings,  shootings,  emergency trauma  situations,  fires,  accidents, HAZMAT  disasters,  every  kind  of  incident we could think of, all of us were in awe,  Democrats  and  Republicans,  of the job these people do every day. Since  that  time,  I  have  worked  with Tom  in  a  number  of  capacities.  He  became  the President of  the  local here  in the  District  of  Columbia.  And  then when an opening occurred  last year, he was  offered  the  temporary  assignment of  serving  as  the  District  of  Columbia Fire Chief. He  did  an  outstanding  job,  Mr. Speaker. When he took over the role of the  chief,  he  said  he  would  do  it,  but would have as his ultimate goal the objective  of  improving  the  life  safety  for the firefighters who he now had responsibility for. 2130 The  safety  and  well-being  of  fire fighters  and  EMS  personnel  across America  is  a major  issue, Mr. Speaker. In  fact,  each  year, we  lose  over  100  fire and  EMS  personnel,  most  of  them  volunteers,  because  the  bulk  of  our  Nation\u2019s  fire  fighters  are  volunteers,  in the  course  of  their  doing  their  job. Over 100. In fact, the D.C. Fire Department has lost three fire fighters within the last 3 years.  In  fact, Mr. Speaker,  following a fire several years ago that took the life of one of D.C.\u2019s finest, a fire where that life  probably  should  have  been  able  to be  saved,  a  series  of  recommendations were made, recommendations following the  death  of  fire  fighter  and  Sergeant John Carter. John Carter\u2019s widow was  at  the  press conference  today  where  we  called  for action  to  restore  these  cuts  that  were made to the D.C. fire department. John Carter was a dedicated professional. He left  behind  a  widow  and  a  10-year-old son.  He  died  in  an  unfortunate  circumstance  that  probably  could  have been  avoided,  as  did  two  of  his  colleagues  who  died  almost  1  year  ago  in May of last year. Following  the  death  of  John  Carter, the  Committee  on  Appropriations  of this  body  in  its  legislative  language  in last  year\u2019s  bill  put  in  the  following item,  and  I  will  quote  from  this  bill which  is  actually  District  of  Columbia Appropriations  bill  for  the  year  2000 passed  in  this  body  on  July  22,  1999. This  is  what  it  says,  \u2018\u2018The  Committee encourages  the  District  to  provide funding  for  two  critically  important safety measures that were developed by the  fire  department  internal  committee  following  the  death  of  Fire Fighter John Carter  2 years ago. These safety  measures  include  restoring  the aide  to  the  battalion  chief  within  the fire  fighting  division  and  increasing staffing  levels  to  at  least  five  fire fighters on ladder companies. \u2018\u2018The  mission  of  the  fire  and  emergency  medical  services  department  is to  improve  the  quality  of  life  to  those who  choose  to  live,  work,  visit,  and  do business  in the District of Columbia by preventing  fires  before  they  occur,  extinguish  those  fires  that  do  occur,  and providing  emergency  medical  and  ambulance service.\u2019\u2019 This  was  in  the  law  that  we  passed last  year  in  response  to  the  death  of Fire Fighter Carter. Unfortunately,  Mr.  Speaker,  last year  we  saw  two  additional  deaths  of D.C.  fire  fighters.  In  fact,  in a  fire  that occurred  on May  30,  1999  at  3146 Cherry Road  in  Northeast,  two  fire  fighters paid  the  ultimate  price,  and  they  left their families behind. In  fact, Mr.  Speaker,  I  came  down  to Washington  at  the  request  of  the  local fire  department  along  with  the  gentleman  from  Maryland  (Mr.  and  we  joined  the  thousands  of  fire fighters,  both  locally  and  nationally, who  came  to  pay  their  respects  to these two brave individuals. There  was  a  second  study  done,  Mr. Speaker,  following  this  fire.  I  will enter  into  the  the  report  of that fire from the Reconstruction Committee, as follows: HOYER), RECORD DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FIRE AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT\u2014REPORT FROM RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE THE REGARDING FIRE AT 3146 CHERRY ROAD, NE, WASHINGTON, DC, ON MAY 30, 1999 Incident  Commanders  need  to  follow  the Incident  Command  System  and  sector  every incident  immediately  upon  arrival. This will reduce  fireground  confusion  and  allow  the Incident  Commander  to  quickly  contact  sector  leaders  to  determine  the  locations  of companies in their sectors. The  Safety  Officer  should  calls.  Instead,  a  member  not  conduct  roll of  the  Incident aide) chief  Command  Staff  (e.g.,  a  battalion  should conduct roll calls. The Training Academy must conduct ongoing  training  and  evaluation  of  fire  fighters and  fire  officers  to  ensure  that  all  Department  personnel  respond  properly  to  roll calls.  Roll  call  training  must  be  part  of  recruit  training,  company  level  drills  and training academy refresher courses. FIREGROUND COMMAND Problem\u2014Command  Post  Location.\u2014Battalion Fire  Chief  1\u2019s  vehicle was  not  in  a  position  to  allow  him  an  adequate  view  of  the incident.  Battalion  Fire  Chief  1  unsuccessfully attempted to relocate the vehicle to obtain  a  better  view,  then  left  his  vehicle  and proceeded  to  the  front  of  the  building.  Battalion  Fire  Chief  1  never  established  a  fixed command post. By  leaving  his  vehicle,  BFC\u20131  abandoned the  stronger  car-mounted  mobile  radio  and was  forced  to  communicate  using  a  weaker portable  radio.  The  use  of  a  single  portable radio  also  caused  missed  messages,  due  to switching back and  forth between  fireground and  dispatch  channels.  In  addition,  it  was impossible  to  maintain  the  command  chart from a roving position. Recommendation.\u2014Incident  Commanders must  establish  fixed  command  posts. A  fixed position  allows  for  better  communication, tracking  of  companies  and  a  better  environment  for  decision  making.  The  Incident Commander  should use  either his/her vehicle or  another  emergency  vehicle  that  is  more suitably  located  for  this  task. The  command post should allow a view of the building that includes  at  least  one,  and  preferably  two, sides.  The  use  of  a  fixed  command  post  allows  the  Incidence  Commander  to  simultaneously  monitor  multiple  radio  channels  at greater  signal  strength  as  well  as  access  to both mobile and portable radios. Problem\u2014Changing  Tactics.\u2014Extinguishing  this  fire  involved  a  change  in  tactics  from  a  front  to  a  rear  oriented  attack. This  change  in  tactics  required  close  coordination  and  communication  between  BFC\u20131 and  the  front  and  rear  fire  suppression teams.  Battalion  Fire  Chief  1  was  unable  to coordinate  front  and  rear  teams  because  he lacked  information,  particularly  the  location of engine company crews. Recommendation.\u2014Proper  management  of the  fireground  requires  the  assistance  of  a battalion  chief\u2019s  aide.  This  position  was  restored  on  December  19,  1999.  Department should  continue  the  position  of  battalion chief\u2019s  aide  and  their  role  includes  the  following:  Assist  in  the  coordination  of fireground  activities;  gather  critical  information  for  the  Incident  Commander;  allow the  Incident  Commander  to  sector  the  incident  sooner;  handle  specific  tasks,  such  as accountability,  as  directed  by  the  Incident Commander;  improving  fireground  communications. The position of battalion chief\u2019s aide is important  to  fireground  safety.  All  personnel should  understand  the  function  of  this  and other  command  staff  positions  through training  in  the  Department\u2019s  Incident  Command System. Problem\u2014Sectoring.\u2014Battalion  Fire  Chief 1  never  sectored  the  fire  or  properly  used  a tactical  worksheet.  He  was  quickly  overwhelmed  trying  to  manage  this  escalating incident.  BFC\u20132  was  assigned  to  the  rear, however,  he  was  never  assigned  any  companies  nor  were  specific  companies  directed  to report to him. Recommendation\u2014Incident  Commanders must  follow  the Department\u2019s  Incident Command  System  procedures  on  sectoring  an  incident  and  use  command  charts  at  all  incidents.  Sectors  must  be  established  in  the early  stages  of  all  emergency  incidents. Sector  leaders  must  be  assigned  companies  for VerDate 09-MAY-2000 05:15 May 09, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K08MY7.065 pfrm03 PsN: H08PT1 ",

            "44": "May 8, 2000  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE S3573  aide.  District  Attorney Whetstone  told  me,  \u2018\u2018I  was  never  more  stunned  when  I  talked  to  school  officials  and  they  told  me this is common in our county.\u2019\u2019  We  have  children  we  cannot  control  because of this Federal law. He came to  Washington,  and  we  sat  up  in  the  gallery  and  talked  about  it.  I  respect  David Whetstone and his views. He said  this  cannot  be.  I  began  to  ask  around,  is  this  true?  As  a  matter  of  fact,  this  very  incident  was  focused  on  in  Time  magazine.  There  was  a  full-page  story  about  it  called  \u2018\u2018The  Meanest  Kid  in  Alabama,\u2019\u2019  and  \u2018\u201860  Minutes\u2019\u2019  did  a  story  about  it  because  it  is,  unfortunately, so common around the country.  What  can  we  do  about  it?  I  began  to  ask  leaders  in  education  around  the  State.  The  State  superintendent:  \u2018\u2018Absolutely,  it  is  one  of  the  biggest  problems  we  have.\u2019\u2019  I  talked  to  Paul  Hubbard, head of the teachers union in Alabama:  \u2018\u2018Absolutely,  it  is  a  big  problem.\u2019\u2019  \u2018\u2018I  am  tired,\u2019\u2019  he  said  in  the  newspaper  recently,  \u2018\u2018of  children  cursing  my  teachers  in  the  classroom  and  nothing being done about it.\u2019\u2019  Then  we  began  to  talk  to  teachers,  principals,  and  school  board  superintendents. They  talked about  the  lawyers  and  the  complicated  regulations  with which  they deal.  It  is  really unacceptable.  Teachers  who  have  been  trained  with  masters\u2019  degrees  in  special  education  to  deal  with  these  children have also overwhelmingly told me  this  is not a healthy thing, that we are  telling  special  children  with  physical  disabilities,  or  disabilities  as  defined  by  the  Federal  law,  that  they  don\u2019t  have  to  adhere  to  the  same  standards  other  children  do.  Right  in  the  classroom,  we  create,  by  Federal  law,  two  separate  standards  for  American  citizens.  You  can  say  to  one  child:  You  can\u2019t do this, you are out of school. But  we  can  say  to  another  children:  You  can do it, and you are only out 10 days,  or  maybe  45  days,  and  then  you  are  back  in  the  classroom.  That  is  not  defensible.  I  want  to  share  some  of  the  letters  I  began  to  receive  from  teachers  who  care  about  this  problem  and  want  me  and  you  and  the  Members  of  this  Congress  to  do  something  about  it.  I  believe  we  can.  I  hope  it  will  be  part  of  the  debate  this  year  in  our  political  arena.  Maybe  we  can  make  some  progress with it.  First,  I  want  to  mention  that  when  Congress  passed  the  IDEA\u2014Individuals  with  Disabilities  Education  Act\u2014in  1975,  we  committed  to  pay  the  States,  whom  we  were  requiring  to  do  it\u2014we  require  these  States  to  meet  these  standards. We  agreed  to  pay  40  percent  of  the  cost.  We  have  never  paid  more  than  15  percent  of  the  cost.  It has  been  below  10 percent  in most years. We had  testimony  in  the  Health,  Education,  and  Labor  Committee,  of  which  I  am  a  member,  from  a  superintendent  in  Vermont  who  testified  to  our  committee  that  20  percent  of  the  cost  of  the  school  system  in  his  county  is  for  special  education  children.  This  is  a  major  factor  in  education  today.  Let  me  share  some  stories  with  you  about  this.  An  experienced  educator  in  Alabama  shared these thoughts with me in a letter:  We  have  a  student  who  is  classified  emotionally  conflicted,  learning  disabled,  and  who  has  attention  deficit  disorder.  While  this  student  has  been  enrolled,  students,  teachers,  and  staff  have  been  verbally  threatened  with  physical  harm.  Fits  of  anger,  fighting,  and  outbursts  of  verbal  abuse  have  been  commonplace.  Parents  and  students  have  expressed  concern  over  the  safety  of  their  children  due  to  the  behavior  of  this  young  man.  Teachers  have  also  become  extremely  apprehensive  toward  the  presence  of  the  student  due  to  his  explosive  behavior.  His  misbehavior  has  escalated  to  the  point  that  the  instructional  process  of  the entire school has been jeopardized.  Here is another one:  I  have  taught  for  25  years.  I  plan  to  continue  teaching,  but  the  problems  with  discipline  are  getting  out  of  hand.  We  are  not  allowed  to  discipline  certain  students.  Any  student  labeled  as  \u2018\u2018special  needs\u2019\u2019  must  be  accommodated,  not  disciplined.  A  student  recently  brought  a  gun  to  my  school.  He  made threats to students and teachers which  he  claims  were  jokes.  I  was  one  of  those  teachers.  This  student  has  been  disruptive  and belligerent  since  I  first  encountered him  in the ninth grade. Now, he  is a senior. After  bringing  a  gun  to  school,  he  was  given  another  \u2018\u2018second  chance.\u2019\u2019  He  should  have  been  expelled.  What  is  his  handicap?  He  has  a  problem  with  mathematics.  While  this  may  be an extreme situation, it is not isolated.  Still reading from the letter:  Teachers  are  told  to  handle  discipline  in  the  classroom.  The  Government  has  taken  most of  the  teachers\u2019  rights away; our hands  are tied.  This  is  a  letter  from  a young  teacher  in  a  small  town  of  about  25,000  in  Alabama.  This  is  a  story  by  which  I  think  anybody would be moved:  As  a  special  educator  of  six  years,  I  consider myself \u2018\u2018on the front lines\u2019\u2019 of the ongoing  battles  that  take  place  on  a  daily  basis  in  our  Nation\u2019s  schools.  I  strongly  believe  that  part  of  the  \u2018\u2018ammunition\u2019\u2019  that  fuels  these  struggles  are  the  \u2018\u2018right\u2019\u2019  guaranteed  to  certain  individuals  by  IDEA  \u201997.  The  law,  though  well  intentioned,  has  become  one  of  the  single  greatest  obstacles  that  educators  face  in  our  fight  to  provide  all  of  our  children  with  a  quality  education  delivered  in  a  safe  environment.  There  are  many  examples  that  I  can  offer  first  hand.  However,  let  me  reiterate that I am a special educator. I have  dedicated  my  life  to  helping  children  with  special needs. It is my job to study and know  the  abilities  and  limitations  of  such  children.  I  have  a  bachelor\u2019s  degree  in  psychology,  a  masters  degree  in  special  education  and  a  Ph.D.  in  good  old  common  sense.  No  where  in  my  educational  process  have  I  been  taught  a  certain  few  \u2018\u2018disabled\u2019\u2019  students  should  have  a  \u2018\u2018right\u2019\u2019  to  endanger  the  right  to  an  education  of  all  other  disabled  and  non-disabled  children.  It\u2019s  non-  sense;  it\u2019s wrong;  it\u2019s dangerous; and  it must  be stopped.  There is no telling how many instructional  hours are lost by teachers in dealing with behavior  problems.  In  times  of  an  increasingly  competitive  global  society  it  is  no  wonder  American  students  fall  short.  Certain  children  are  allowed  to  remain  in  the  classroom  robbing  the  other  children  of  hours  that  can  never be replaced.  There  is  no  need  to  extend  the  school  day.  There  is  no  need  to  extend  the  school  year.  If  politicians would  just make  it  possible  for  educators  to  take  back  the  time  that  is  lost  on  a  daily  basis  to  certain  individuals  there  is  no  doubt we would  have  a  better  educated  students.  It is even more frustrating when it is a special  education  child  who  knows  and  boasts  \u2018\u2018they  can\u2019t  do  anything  to  me\u2019\u2019  and  he  is  placed  back  in  the  classroom  to  disrupt  it  day after day, week after week.  It  is  clear  that  IDEA  \u201997  not  only  undermines  the  educational  process  it  also  undermines  the  authority  of  educators.  In  a  time  when  our  profession  is  being  called  upon  to  protect  our  children  from  increasingly  dangerous  sources  our  credibility  is  being  stripped from us.  I  am  sure  you  have  heard  the  saying:  The  teachers  are  scared  of  the  principals,  the  principals  are  scared  of  the  superintendents,  the  superintendents  are  scared  of  the  parents,  the  parents  are  scared  of  the  children,  and  the  children  are  scared  of  no  one.  And  why should they be?  I have experienced the ramifications of the  \u2018\u2018new  and  improved\u2019\u2019  law  first  hand.  I  had  one  child  attempt  to  assault  me\u2014he  had  been  successful  with  two  other  teachers.  He  was  suspended  for  one  day.  I  had  another  child make  sexual  gestures  to me  in  front  of  the  entire  class.  Despite  the  fact  that  every  child  in my  class  and  a majority  of  the  children  in  the  school  knew  of  it,  I  was  told  by  my assistant principal  that nothing  could be  done  because  \u2018\u2018these  special  ed  kids  have  rights.\u2019\u2019  I  literally  got  in my  car  to  leave  that  day,  but  my  financial  obligations  to  my  family  and my moral responsibilities to the children  I had in my class kept me there.  The  particular  child  I  spoke  about  frequently  made  vulgar  comments  and  threats  to my girls in my class on every opportunity  he had when there was no adult present. Fortunately,  the  girls,  also  special  ed,  could  talk to me about  it. Unfortunately, they had  to  put  up  with  it  because  \u2018\u2018nothing  could  be  done.\u2019\u2019  I know of a learning disabled child who cut  a  girl  in  a  fight.  The  learning  disabled  child  and  her  parents  then  attempted  to  sue  the  school  system  because  the  child  was  burned  when  she  grabbed  a  coffee  pot  to  break  it  over  the  other  child\u2019s  head.  I  know  of  another  specific  incident  where  three  children  brought  firearms  to  school.  The  two  \u2018\u2018regular\u2019\u2019  children  where  expelled.  The  special  education student was back to school the following week.  I fully expect that you and your colleagues  in  Washington  will  do  what  it  takes  to  take  our  schools  back  from  this  small  group  of  children  who  feel  it  is  their  right  to  endanger  the  education  of  every  other  child  in  school.  As  my  grandmother  said,  \u2018\u2018right  is  right and wrong is wrong\u2019\u2019 and to enable this  to continue is just wrong.  She does have a right to expect Members  of  this  Congress  to  confront  this  issue and not allow it to continue.  This  is  a  letter  from  a  town  in  Alabama with a population of  20,000, or  so,  from  another  special  education  teacher.  As  a  special  educator  teacher  for  27  years,  may  I  applaud  your  efforts  to  make  special  education  students  as  accountable  as  any  other  student  for  any  behavior  they  exhibit  while  in  school.  I  fully  support  the  idea  that  just because they are students in need of special  education  services  that  it  in  no  way  diminishes  their  ability  to  tell  right  from  wrong.

All  but  a  handful  of  charismatic  teachers  studiously  avoided giving  low grades, demanding homework, or administering tests.  We all came down here  last week. We  preached. We had  different  views  about  what we ought to do.  We  know  there  is  something  badly  wrong  in  K\u201312  today.  We  know  it.  Everybody  knows  it.  The  data  is  just  beyond  description\u2014the  number  of  students  who  cannot  read,  who  do  not  have quality math skills.  With  this  activity  going  on,  it  is  going  to  be  pretty  hard,  no  matter  what  we  do,  to  get  things  reversed. We  want  quality  teachers.  We  want  to  recruit  quality  teachers.  How many  Senators  have  come  down  here  talking  about  wanting  a  quality  teacher?  I  think  just  about  everybody.  How  are  we  going  to  get  a  quality  teacher  with  this stuff going on where they work?  Over  the  5-year  period,  just  5  years,  from 1993 to 1997, teachers were the victims  of  1,771,000  nonfatal  crimes  at  school,  including  1,114,000  thefts,  and  657,000  violent  crimes.  On  the  average  this  would  be  about  350,000-plus  crimes  per year.  Madam President, I made my point. I  want  to  give  the  other  side  some  time.  For the moment, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Massachusetts.  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we  have the Gregg-Lott amendment before  us.  The  Senator  has  spoken  about  the  liability  provisions  that  have  been  included. There  are  four  other  provisions  that are included in the amendment.  At  the  appropriate  time,  I  am  going  to urge  the Senate  to  accept  the Gregg  amendment.  It  seems  to  me  the  case  ought  to  be  made  within  the  States,  since  the  States  have  the  power  to  take  action  on  the  matter  discussed  here  during  the course of this afternoon. The liability  provision  the  Senator  has  mentioned  would  say  if  the  States  have  weaker  provisions,  then  these  standards would stand. If they have stronger  standards  in  order  to  deal  with  the  problems  of  protecting  those  who  are  involved  in  education,  than  those  would stand.  A  number  of  States  have  taken  it.  It  always  seemed  we  were  focused  on  what was  going  to  happen  in  the  classroom. If the States wanted to take that  action,  they  should  take  it.  A  number  of  them  have.  The  Senator  has  offered  an  amendment  which  includes  these  provisions. We are going to recommend  they move ahead and  they be accepted.  There  were  other  provisions  that  were  included  in  the  Gregg  amendment.  It  makes  some  small  adjustments to what they call the TOPS Program  by  requiring  every  local  district  to  take  advantage  of  what  the  TOPS  Program would be. They change the requirements  to  say  that  every  local  district has to do it, instead of just failing  ones. I think that is an improvement.  It  adds  a  part  of  our  Democratic  teacher  quality  accountability  provision,  so  after  3  years,  if  the  local  district is not improving, the district cannot get  the  fourth and  fifth year  funds.  We  do  that  plus  provide  additional  kinds of protections. Theirs is a modest  change, but a useful one.  As  I  said,  it  provides  teacher  liability, which  is  acceptable. Then,  as  I  understand it\u2014I read it\u2014there is, in addition, a small pot of money for financial  incentives  for  certifications  of  teachers.  That  is  not  objectionable.  It  is  a  very modest  program.  It might  provide  some value for teachers.  But  I  want  to  come  back  to  the  underlying themes of where we are in this  legislation.  The  amendment  itself  can  be easily wiped out by the Governors of  the  States;  the  teacher  quality  program  is  blockgranted  under  Straight  A\u2019s in S. 2.  So  in  effect,  if  the  Governor  wanted  to  block  grant  the  whole  TOPS  Program\u2014their  basis  for  recruitment,  mentoring,  and  upgrading  skills  for  teachers  in  classrooms,  which  is  their  teacher  education  program,  they  could  do  it.  It  disappears.  The  teacher  quality  program  can  be  block  granted  in  the  50-State  block  grant  and  the  15-  State block grant.  So we  are  effectively  eliminating\u2014or  under  the  Republican  program  we  are  giving  the  Governor,  at  his  own  whim,  the ability  to  eliminate all  the  teacher  enhancement programs.  We  are  not  there.  Democrats  are  not  there.  We  believe  in  having  a  strong  emphasis  in  our  program,  a  $2  billion  program,  that  recognizes  high  quality  recruitment,  mentoring,  and  professional development.  Just  on  page  630,  there  is  the  treatment  of  the  eligible  programs,  those  which  can  be  block  granted.  Here  we  have  subparts  1,  2,  and  3  of  part  (A)  of  title  II,  that  is  teacher  empowerment.  That  is  true  on  page  656,  which  is  the  15-State block grant.  Why  do  we  have  this  debate  on  a  Monday  afternoon? We  say OK, we will  accept  it.  If we  are  going  to  eventually  pass S.  2,  it will not  be  in  effect  in  any  event. So let\u2019s get on to other issues.  This is what has bothered many of us  during  the  course  of  this whole  debate.  There is this fundamental commitment  of  our  Republican  friends  to  block  grant these programs and issue a blank  check  for  these  programs.  But,  on  the  other  hand,  they  say  that  they  are  really serious about these programs.  How can we accept the fact that they  are  serious  about  putting  a  well-qualified  teacher  in  every  classroom  when  they  give  an  opportunity  to  the  Governors  to  wipe  out  that  entire  program?  We  do  not  do  that.  We  say  it  is  essential,  as  part  of  the  program  to  which  we  are  committed,  that  you  are  going  to  have  an  effective  program  in  recruiting  and  also  in  professional  development.  Let\u2019s  take  another  look  at  page  632  under the block grant program. We call  it  the  blank  check\u2014block  grant  program. On page 632 it says:  (d)  Uses  of  funds  under  agreement.\u2014Funds  made  available  to  a  State  under  this  part  shall be used for educational purposes . . .  Educational  purposes.  Do  my  colleagues  know  what  qualifies  for  educational  purposes?  State  administrators and their offices. That qualifies for  State educational purposes.  We  have  heard  a  great  deal  of  rhetoric  about  how  they  want  to  get  the  money  where  it  ought  to  be,  with  needy  students,  and,  under  their  own  definitions,  they  say  it  can  be  used  for  any educational purpose. It can be used  by local administrators for their needs,  it  can  be  used  for  sports  facilities,  it  can  be  used  for  band  uniforms,  because  States  spend  their  educational  money  for those purposes.  What  the  Republicans  say  is  that  they can use the money we are going to  provide  to  them  on  whatever  the  States want to use it. The States use it  for  band  uniforms.  They  use  it  for  administrative  funds.  They  use  it  for  State  departments  of  education.  Not  our program, but theirs does.  On  the  one  hand,  we  have  an  amendment  to  the  TOPS  Program  that  effectively  can  be  wiped  out  by  the  Governors  and  the  block  grant,  and  then  we  look  at  how  they  define  what  are  educational  purposes  under  this  legislation.  They  create  a  loophole  for  the  Governors  to  drive  a  truck  through.  The  Governors  will  make  those  decisions,  not  the  local  educators.  It  is  not  going  to  be  the  parents.  It  is  not  going  to  be  the  local  school  boards.  It  is  the  Governors.  One  asks:  Why,  Senator,  is  it  the  Governors?  Because  the  Governors  are  the  only  ones  who,  at  the  end  of  5  years,  are  held  accountable.  They  are  the  ones  held  accountable.  All  they  need is to have substantial compliance,  and  then  they  can  reapply  for  5  more  years.  If  this  goes  on\u2014and  I  do  not  believe it will because I do not think they  are  going  to  get  the  results  under  this  program.  I  want  to  take  a  few  minutes  of  the  Senate\u2019s  time  to  come  back  to  why  we  feel  so  strongly  about  targeting  these  programs.  I  am  going  to  speak  about  the importance of recruitment and professional  development  and  the  importance of mentoring.  As  I  have  said  at  other  times  during  this  debate,  we  are  committed  to  having  a  well-qualified  teacher  in  every  classroom  in  this  country  by  the  time  this legislation has expired.  What  is  happening  at  the  present  time?  This  is  the  most  recent  report  from  1999,  using  statistics  from  1994.  We  see  that  about  two-thirds  of  individuals  who  went  into  teaching  had  a  regular  or  advanced  license.  \u2018\u2018No  license,\u2019\u2019  \u2018\u2018substandard  license,\u2019\u2019 or  \u2018\u2018probationary  license\u2019\u2019  are  terms  used  by  the  States  to  describe  those  who  have  not  met  certification.  They  use  them  interchangeably  for  the  most  part.  Basically,  a  third  have  not  met  the  rigorous  standards.  We  are  setting  rigorous  standards  to  make  sure  we  have  good teachers.

            "60": "May 8, 2000  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE S3589  COATS COATS So,  if  you  take  things  out  of  context  you  can  prove  the  Bible  says  \u2018There  is  no  God.\u2019  That  is  what  Senator  Coats  did  this  morning.  Senator  sent  this  notice  around  to  our  offices  this  morning,  \u2018\u2018Urgent,  Members  Attention  Only,\u2019\u2019  and  it  says,  \u2018\u2018Senator  Harkin: Reasons  to Vote No on Elementary-Secondary  Act;  Iowa  Would  Lose  $9.95  a  million.\u2019\u2019  I  assume  that  is  where  my  colleague  got that figure.  Senator  is  only  telling  half  the  story.  He  is  sort  of  saying  it  says,  in  the  Bible, \u2018\u2018There is no God,\u2019\u2019 but he does not tell  you what the sentence before it says.  I tried to get the floor this morning to correct it. We were under a time agreement, the  time  ran  out  and  I  could  not  get  the  floor.  Fortunately,  I  was  able  to  talk  to  Senators  as  they  came  to  the  well  to  let  them  know  that  the  figures  that Senator Coats was  putting out were wrong.  Let me  correct  that  record  now.  Iowa  does  not  lose  $10  million.  I  happen  to  chair  the  Appropriations  Committee  that  funds  the  money. There  is no way this would have gotten through if my State was going to lose $10  million,  I  can  tell  you  that,  Mr.  President.  No,  what  we  did  and  what  is  not  being  said  here  and  what  is  not  understood\u2014and  I  say  this  to my  friend  from  Iowa, my  colleague\u2014  there  are  two  parts  to  this  formula  on  title  I.  There  is  the  targeted  grant  formula.  That  is  what  Senator  Coats  is  using.  If  you  only  look  at  the  targeted  grant money,  yes,  Iowa  and  a  lot  of  other  States  lose  money.  But  what  we  added  in  conference  was  another  portion  of  the  formula  called  effort  and  equity,  something  I  feel  very  strongly  about.  I  debated  it  on  the  Senate  floor.  So  when  we  went to conference, in trying to strike a deal  with  the  House,  they  only  wanted  targeted  grants, but I insisted that we also have a second formula for effort and equity, and that is  what we did.  So  under  the  bill  itself,  there  is  money  that  goes  for  targeted  or  for  effort  and  equity.  New  moneys  that  we  will  appropriate  can  be  split  by  the  Appropriations  Committee.  Some  can  go  to  targeted,  some  can  go  to  effort  and  equity.  The  Appropriations  Subcommittees will decide. First of all, next  year  we  have  already  appropriated  the  money  for  fiscal  year  1995.  That  is  already  done.  For  fiscal  year  1996,  there  is  a  hold-  harmless  clause.  So  no  States  are  going  to  lose  money  in  1996,  not  Iowa  nor  any  other  State can  lose money  in 1996. So, again, Senator  Coats  used  this  from  fiscal  year  1996  to  1999.  You  cannot  use  1996  because  there  is  a  hold-harmless clause.  Beginning  in  fiscal  year  1996,  the  Appropriations  Committee,  under  the  authorization  of  this  bill,  is  allowed  to  use  whatever  new  moneys  we  appropriate,  up  to  $200  million  in  1996,  for  effort  and  equity.  Beyond  that, such sums as are necessary.  Senator  Coats  used  a  figure  from  CRS  of  $400  million.  I  can  show  you  the  record  in  conference.  They  were  talking  about  $400  million  increases  in  title  I.  I  said,  I  don\u2019t  know  what  you  are  talking  about.  The  average  over  the  last  5  years  has  been  $275,000,  and  under  the  budget  caps  and  the  ceilings  we  have,  there  is  no  way  over  the  next  5  or  6  years  that we  are  going  to  have  a  $400 million  increase  in title I. I would  like to see  it.  If  you  are  asking  me  if  we  can  get  the  money,  would  I  like  to  put  $400  million  in  title  I,  absolutely;  but  we  are  not  going  to  have that kind of money.  So  in  title  I  then,  assuming  we  can  get  a  $200  million  increase,  the  Appropriations  Committee  can  put  all  of  it  into  effort  and  equity,  75  percent  of  it  into  effort  and  equity,  half  of  it  into  effort  and  equity\u2014whatever we want to do.  So  what  we  did  is  we  prepared  a  chart  showing  what  would  happen  to  the  States  if  HARKIN.  GRASSLEY.  just  half  of  the  money  went  into  the  effort  and equity or  if all of  it went  into effort and  equity.  Under  either  one  of  those  scenarios,  Iowa,  instead  of  losing  money,  makes  money.  In  fact,  I  do  not  have  the  runs  for  anything  other  than  $400  million,  but  even  under  $400  million,  Iowa  would  gain  about  $400,000  a  year;  and  if  we  put  the  whole  thing  into  effort  and  equity,  Iowa  would  gain  about  $1.8  million a year.  Mr. GRASSLEY. Will the Senator yield?  Mr. HARKIN. I will be delighted to yield.  Mr. GRASSLEY. Will  the Senator yield  for a  question?  Mr. HARKIN. I will be delighted to yield.  Mr.  Prior  to  the  question,  if  I  can  just  say,  first  of  all,  I  compliment  the  Senator  because  I  know when  it  came  out  of  committee  the  first  time,  that  he  got  the  formula  that  was  in  the  original  bill  introduced  improved  dramatically.  So  our  State  would  be  helped  and  probably  a  lot  of  other  States would be helped. So I compliment him  on that.  I  do  not  know  anything  about  his  activity  in  conference  or  any  other  process,  but  I  did  notice  his  work  in  that  area,  and  he  did  improve it and I compliment him for it.  My  question  is  only  this:  Senator  Coats  and  I  are  both  relying  upon  the  work  of  the  Congressional  Research  Service.  I  have  not  found  the  Congressional  Research  Service  to  be  wrong  very  often,  if  at  all,  that  I  can  recall.  Has  my  colleague  from  Iowa  discussed  this with the people in the Congressional Research Service to see  if they made a mistake  and  how  they  made  a  mistake?  Can  you  tell  me how they made a mistake?  Mr.  I  appreciate  the  question.  I  will  try  to  respond  to  it.  The  figures  I  am  using  come  from  the Congressional Research  Service.  What  I  am  saying  is  that  Senator  Coats only took one column.  Mr.  I  think  I  have  here.  Mr. HARKIN.  If you  look  at  the  chart, what  he  did  was  he  took  the  second  column  over,  which  just  says  $400  million  under  targeted  formula. Senator Coats used that column. He  did  not  take  the  other  two  columns.  The  other two columns add effort and equity; the  third  column  over  showing  what  would  happen  if  we  split  it  in  half;  the  last  column  showing  if  we  put  it  all  into  effort  and  equity.  I  cannot  in  any way  tell my  colleague how  much we will put  in.  I  can assure him  it will  be a minimum of 50 percent. I suggest, knowing  the members  of  the Appropriations Committee  and  that  33  States  will  be  helped  by  effort  and  equity,  it  stands  to  reason  that  the bulk of the money will go into effort and  equity. So  I would  say we  are  probably  close  to  the  column  on  the  right-hand  side,  which  shows Iowa getting $54 million.  Keep in mind, that is based on $400 million.  There is no way we are going to get $400 million,  but  it  gives  you  an  idea  of  what  happens under this thing.  So  what  Senator  Coats  did  is  he  simply  took out of context what CRS came up with.  He  took  one  column,  and  that  is  why  I  tried  to  get  the  floor  this morning  to  explain  that  is not so. That is just not the way the Appropriations  Subcommittee  is  going  to  operate,  and  that  is why we  put  the  effort  and  equity  thing in there.  In no way is Iowa going to have their moneys  reduced  under  this  effort  and  equity  formula.  That  is  the  point  I  tried  to make  this  morning and I tried to make it in the well to  the Senators. As I said about my Biblical example,  about  taking  something  out  of  context, sure you can take one column, but that  is not what we are operating under.  I hope that clears  it up. Does my colleague  have any further questions on that?  GRASSLEY.  chart  that  HARKIN.  GRASSLEY.  GRASSLEY.  Mr.  I  do  not  have  any  further  questions, Mr. President. I will say, I hope  it  clears  it up because  I would  like  to  think we  are passing  legislation  that will be more  fair  to more States  than  that original  chart  that  I saw. But I also suggest that I have been  informed  that  Senator  Coats  is  going  to  come  over  and  try  to  discuss  what  interests  my  colleague  from  Iowa  in  some  further  depth,  and  I  think  I  will  defer  to  his  discussion  of  that.  Mr.  I  will  be  glad  to.  I  talked  about  this  with  Senator  Coats  in  private.  I  will discuss it with him on the floor and have  him respond as to what CRS put in the other  columns because he just used one column, he  did not use the other two.  Mr.  Mr.  President,  if  my  colleague  wanted  to  make  the  point  that  what  we  came  back  with  from  conference  was  not  quite  as  good  for  certain  States,  including  my own, as was in the bill passed by the Senate, he  is absolutely  right. But  the  reality  is  that  the House would not accept  that. So we  had  to  work  it  out  with  the  House,  and  I  think  we  worked  it  out  in  a  reasonably  fair  manner, I must say.  The  original  formula  that  came  out  of  the  Clinton administration, what  they had advocated,  was  devastating  for  Iowa  and  for  a  number of other States.  But  we  worked  with  Senator  Pell,  Senator  Kennedy,  Senator  Hatch,  Senator  Kassebaum  and  Senator  Jeffords.  We  worked  this  whole  thing  out  in  committee  on  a  bipartisan basis to come up with a better formula.  We  did  that.  We  had  votes  on  it.  We  had  debates. We even had a debate here on the Senate floor. We had a vote. But in going to conference  it was  clear  that  the House Members  were not going  to accept  in  totality what we  had done in the Senate. And thus we came up  with  this  new  formula.  And,  quite  frankly,  I  must say I think the new formula is fair.  I  just  want  to  say  the  Congressional  Research  Service,  again,  will  do  any  run  that  Senators ask  for. If you ask  for a run on $500  million a year, they will do that. You can do  a  run  on  $1  billion  a year. They will  do  that.  But  just  because  these  tables  are  prepared  does not mean  that  is actually what  is going  to  happen.  As  I  said,  they  ran  these  tables  based  upon  a  $400-million-a-year  increase  in  title  I.  As  the  chairman  of  the  Appropriations  Subcommittee  that  funds  this  program,  I  can  tell  you  right  now,  unless  somebody  comes  up  with  some  magic  money  someplace,  we  are  not  going  to  have  that  kind  of  money.  We  will  be  lucky  to  get  the  average of the $275 million that we have gotten over the last 5 years.  So  we  tried  to  do  two  things  with  title  I:  target  our  scarce  resources  to  areas  where  they  have  a  high  concentration  of  eligible  children,  but  then  also  to  be  fair  to  rural  States  such  as  Iowa  where  we  may  not  have  high concentrations but we certainly do have  needy  children,  children  in  poverty,  title  I  eligible  children,  but  they  may  be  in  small  towns and communities scattered around the  States  and  thus  the  formula  does  address  that.  Mr.  I  thank  the  Chairman,  and  I  commend him again  for his work on  this  important  legislation,  and  in  particular  this  provision.  The  problems  of  youth  violence  and drug abuse are no longer contained within  urban  school  districts,  and  are  rapidly  spreading  to  suburban  and  rural  communities.  By  making  a  program  available  for  statewide  distribution,  we  can  better  ensure  that  each  student  in  a  State  will  be  reached  by  a  program,  and  that  students  throughout  the State will receive the same messages.  I  was  extremely  impressed  by  Jonathan  Kozol\u2019s  \u2018\u2018Savage  Inequalities,\u2019\u2019  and  I  know  the Senator  from Utah  has  also  done  considerable  research  on  school  equalization.

            "68": "May 8, 2000  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE S3597  I  yield  the  floor  so  the  Senator  from  Massachusetts can make his closing remarks,  and  then  I  believe  we  are  getting close to coming to an end.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FITZThe  Senator  from  MassachuGERALD).  setts.  Mr.  KENNEDY.  Mr.  President,  we  took  a  valuable  and  useful  step  a  few  moments  ago  when  we  preserved  the  vocational  education  legislation  outside  of  the  block  grant,  the  basic  Perkins  program,  which  affects  some  6  million children in the K\u201312 and some 3  million students  in post-secondary programs.  I  intend  to  offer  an  amendment  on  teacher  quality  tomorrow.  I  have  spoken on it this afternoon.  Before  this  legislation  is  finished,  there  will  be  efforts  made  by  members  of  our  committee  to  also  exclude  the  block  granting  of  the  Migrant  Education  Program  and  the  homeless  programs.  I  will  take  a  moment  to  mention what  the  current  situation  is with  regard  to  the  Migrant  Education  Program.  The Migrant Education Program provides  financial assistance  to State educational  agencies  to  establish  and  improve  programs  of  education  for  children  of  migratory  farm  workers  that  enable  them  to  meet  the  same  academic  standards  as  other  children.  To  help  achieve  this  objective,  program  services  help  migrant  children  overcome  the  educational  disruption  and  other  problems  that  result  from  repeated moves.  Program  funds  also  promote  coordination  of  needed  services  across  the  States.  The  most  recent  data  reported  by  States  indicate  more  than  750,000 migrant  children  are  eligible for services.  The  Federal  Migrant  Education  Program is the only ongoing source of support  for  these  highly  mobile  migrant  children.  The  poverty  and  mobility,  and  often  limited  English  proficiency,  characteristics  of  the  migrant  student  population  combine  to  make  demands  for educational  services go well beyond  the  services  traditionally  supported  under  State  and  local  education  budgets.  No  State  currently  provides  ongoing  funding  for  migrant  programs  to  help  these  children.  We  are  wiping  out  the  Federal commitment. For example, the  Migrant  Education  Program  supports  supplementary  instruction  in  core  academic  subjects,  beyond  which  title  I  typically  provides,  often  provided  outside  the  regular  schoolday  and  in  the  summer designed to address the special  educational  needs  of  children  who  move  and  are  out  of  school  frequently.  Without  these  funds,  many  highly  mobile  migrant  children  may  attend  school  sporadically  throughout  the  year  or  not  attend  school  at  all.  Without  the  funds,  the  local  education  groups  are unlikely  to  provide  the normal  range  of  services  to  children  who  attend their schools  for brief periods of  time,  or  go  out  to  find  and  enroll  migrant children outside of normal school  enrollment  procedures,  or  grapple with  either the school interruption problems  faced  by  migrant  children  or  their  needs for special summer programs.  Without this program, States and the  local  educational  authorities  would  have  little  incentive  to  identify  and  serve  migrant  children,  who  cross  school  districts  and/or  State  boundaries.  No  single  local  educational  agency,  and,  in  many  cases,  no  single  State,  is  responsible  for  the  education  of  a  migrant child. No single local educational  agency,  and,  in  many  cases,  no  single  State,  provides  educational  services  to  a migrant child during a single year.  The  Migrant  Education  Program  encourages  and  supports  collaborative  efforts  and  interventions  across  State  lines  to  accommodate  the  needs  of  migrant children.  The Migrant Education Program provides  support  services  that  link  migrant  children  and  their  families  to  community  services. For  example,  during the regular school year, almost half  of  migrant  students  receive  social  work/outreach  services,  about  30  percent  receive  guidance  and  counseling,  and  almost  a  fourth  receive  health  services  under  the  Migrant  Education  Program.  Effectively,  the  point  is  that  certainly  at  the  national  level  we  are  dropping  the  commitment  to  try  to  do  something about all of these children.  With regard to the homeless children,  nationally there were 625,000 school age  children  identified  as  homeless  during  the 1997\u20131998 school year. Without separate  funding  for  this national program,  it  is  unlikely  that  significant  numbers  of these children and their unique problems will be addressed. They have higher  than  average  rates  of  poor  health,  anxiety,  depression,  withdrawal,  delinquency,  aggressive  behavior,  learning  disabilities,  and  suicides.  Those  problems  will  not  be  addressed.  Through  participation  in  the  existing  program,  the States are focusing on reducing the  barriers  homeless  children  face  in  enrolling  in  and  attending  school  on  a  regular basis.  Because  of  national  leadership,  almost  all  the  States  have  revised  their  laws.  Almost  all  the  States  revised  their  laws,  regulations,  and  policies  to  improve  the  access  to  education  for  homeless  students.  Twenty-seven  States  changed  their  residency  laws  or  regulations.  Otherwise,  the  children  would not be able to be eligible. Almost  all  State  coordinators  report  either  that  all  the  students  can  enroll  without  school  records\u2014that  previously  stopped  children  from  being  able  to  participate in the schools\u2014or that they  have  made  special  allowances  to  expedite  their  record  transfers.  Thirty-five  States  eliminated  the  barriers  of  immunization  and  guardianship  requirements,  otherwise  some  homeless  children  would  be  prohibited  from  participating in services.  These  are  enormously  vulnerable  children. There  is  absolutely  no  reason  or  justification  to  eliminate  these  programs,  block  grant  them,  and  send  them  to  the  States.  The  States  have  not  responded  to  this  population\u2019s  unique needs.  In  the  absence  of  the  homeless  program,  I  think  States  would  not  have  the resources to employ a State coordinator  for  homeless  children  and  youth,  a position that is responsible for ensuring  that  homeless  children  and  youth  have  access  to  a  free,  appropriate  public education.  Without  the  homeless  program,  the  local  educational  authorities  that  rely  on  Federal  funds  to  provide  services  to  homeless  children  would  have  to  find  funds  in  their  own  operating  budgets,  which  are  already  overextended,  or  stop  providing  supplemental  services  to  these  children,  who  are  among  the  neediest.  Last year, we provided $29 million for  the  education  of  homeless  children.  That  is  going  to  be  eliminated.  These  funds  most  likely  will  not  be  made  up  by the States. These children are going  to  be  ill  served.  It  is  basically  and  fundamentally wrong. I think we are going  to  be  abdicating  our  responsibilities  if  we  do  not  target  some  resources  to  what  I  think  has  been  an  effective  program.  We  have  had  some  hearings  on  this  problem  in  the  past.  People  have  just  been  extraordinary  in  how  committed  and  dedicated  they  have  been  and  how  they have stretched scarce resources to  make  a  real  difference  in  children\u2019s  lives.  We  in  this body  rarely go a day when  someone  isn\u2019t  talking  about  our  future  being  our  children  and  our  responsibility to them. We ought to understand  what  we  are  doing  to  the  most  vulnerable  children  in  our  society,  the  poorest children, the homeless children, the  migrant  children,  the  immigrant  children, and others in failing to guarantee  their  protection.  I  take  strong  exception.  And  I  will  offer  an  amendment,  with  others.  Others  have  offered  an  amendment  to  restore  those  programs.  I  look  forward  to  that.  Hopefully,  we  will  have  an  opportunity  to  address  that.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Washington.  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the subject  before  the  Senate  this  afternoon,  and until the vote is taken on it tomorrow,  is  the  Lott-Gregg  amendment  to  the  Teacher  Empowerment Act  section  of this bill.  The Teacher Empowerment Act itself  is  quite  significant  in  a  number  of  ways,  primarily  in  focusing  on  increased  teacher  quality  across  the  United  States  of  America  but,  at  the  same  time,  allowing  a  maximum  degree  of  flexibility  in  local  choices  with  respect  to  how  that  teacher  quality  is,  in fact, enhanced.

To  this  end,  Wayne  Elementary  School  encourages  parents  and  other  members  of  the  community  to  become  involved  with  the  education  of  their  children.  In  1998,  working  in  cooperation  with  the  Greening  of  Detroit  and  the  Ford  Motor  company  volunteers,  the  children  planted  trees,  bushes  and  wild  flowers  during  the  month  of  May.  The  habitat  area  now  serves  as  an  outdoor  classroom  and  each  spring  the  students  intend  to  plant  more  trees,  bushes and flowers.  Two  other  important  programs  have  recently  been  developed  at  Wayne  Elementary  School.  Academic  Games,  started  by  Ms.  Nicole  Stewart,  encourages  learning achievement while at the  same  time  demonstrating  to  students  that  learning can  indeed be  fun. And  in  1995,  two  chess  teams  were  formed  by  Mr.  Carter  and  Mr.  Cook,  a  primary  team  (K\u20133)  and  an  upper  elementary  team  of  fourth  and  fifth  graders.

Service may be made upon a domestic or foreign  corporation  or  upon  a  partnership  or  other unincorporated association that is subject  to  suit  under  a  common  name,  by  delivering  the  subpoena  to  an  officer,  to  a  managing or general agent, or to any other agent  authorized  by  appointment  or  by  law  to  receive  service  of  process.

The court may issue  an  order  requiring  the  subpoenaed  person  to  appear  before  the  Attorney  General  to  produce  records  if  so  ordered.  Any  failure  to  obey  the  order  of  the  court  may  be  punishable  by  the  court  as  contempt  thereof.  All  process  in  any  such  case  may  be  served  in  any judicial district in which the person may  be found.  \u2018\u2018(e) This section shall be construed and applied  in  a  manner  consistent  with  section  2703 and with  section  1102 of  the Right  to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3402).  \u2018\u2018(f)  The  United  States  Marshals  Service  shall  report  to  the  Attorney  General  on  a  quarterly  basis  regarding  administrative  subpoenas  issued  pursuant  to  this  section.

(b)  MENT.\u2014The analysis for chapter 49 of title 18,  United States Code,  is amended by adding at  the end the following:  \u2018\u20181075.  Administrative  subpoenas  hend fugitives.\u2019\u2019.  CONFORMING TECHNICAL AMENDAND to  appreSECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS\u2014FUGITIVE  APPREHENSION ACT OF 2000  Section 1. Short title  The  title  is  the  Act of 2000.\u2019\u2019  Section 2. Fugitive apprehension task forces  The  purpose  of  this  provision  is  to  assist  Federal,  state and  local  law  enforcement auApprehension  \u2018\u2018Fugitive  thorities  by  forming  several  multiagency  task  forces around  the country  to  locate and  apprehend fugitives wanted by their jurisdictions.  The bill would authorize to be appropriated  to  the  U.S.  Marshal  Service  funds  to  establish  new  permanent  Fugitive  Apprehension  Task  Forces  and  supplement  task  forces  already  operating  in  areas  throughout  the  United  States.  The  task  forces  would  be  totally dedicated  to  locating and apprehending  fugitives  under  the  direction  of  a  National  Director  and  not  under  a  specific  District  to  insure  that  they  are  not  utilized  for  other  USMS missions.  Section 3. Administrative subpoena authority  As  a  general  matter,  under  Federal  law,  if  there  is  no  intent  to  seek  Federal  indictment\u2014as  is  true  in  a  great majority  of  fugitive  apprehension  investigations\u2014law  enforcement  officers  may  not  use  a  grand  jury  subpoena to obtain information relevant to a  fugitive investigation. Indeed, to do so would  constitute  abuse  of  the  grand  jury  process.  Although  there  are  some  mechanisms  to  obtain  this  information  through  application  to  the  court,  time  spent  by  law  enforcement  seeking  state  and  federal  court  orders  to  obtain the release of information can make the  difference  between  apprehension  or  further  flight of a fugitive.  This  provision  would  remedy  the  current  deficiency in the law by providing for administrative  subpoena  authority  in  fugitive  investigations.  The  provision  is  based  on  the  administrative  subpoena  authority  provided  in  title  21,  United  States  Code,  Section  876,  which  authorizes  the  Attorney  General  to  issue  administrative  subpoenas  in  controlled  substance  related  criminal  investigations  and  administrative  proceedings.  However,  this  provision  incorporates  significant  restrictions  on  its  use  in  order  to  satisfy  concerns  over  an  expansion  in  the use  of  administrative subpoenas.  First,  this  is  more  narrowly  tailored  than  Title 21, United States Code, Section 876. The  proposed  section  1075  authorizes  the  Attorney General  to  obtain  only  documents  in  response to the subpoena, not testimony.  Second,  the  statute  is  limited  in  its  application  to  fugitives  in  Federal  and  state  felony  cases,  not  just  those  suspected  of  committing  crimes.  The  authority  would  only  apply to those who had been indicted.  Third,  the  statute  strictly  controls  any  delegation of  the Attorney General\u2019s authority  to  issue  such  subpoenas,  by  requiring  that  any  such  delegation  be  accomplished  only through formal Attorney General guidelines  that  would  be  subject  to  scrutiny.  These  guidelines  would  require  that  an  official  at  the  level  of  Assistant  Director  in  the  Marshals  Service  must  approve  any  such  subpoena.  Fourth,  the  statute  requires  that  before  a  subpoena  can  be  issued,  the  Attorney  General  must  find  that  the  records  sought  are  \u2018\u2018relevant  or  material,\u2019\u2019  i.e.,  there  are  \u2018\u2018articulable  facts\u2019\u2019  that  show  the  fugitive\u2019s  whereabouts  may  be  discerned  from  the  records sought.  Fifth,  the  statute  makes  clear  that  an  administrative  subpoena  issued  under  this  section  does  not  \u2018\u2018trump\u2019\u2019  protections  accorded  records under existing statutes, such as electronic  records  whose  production  is  covered  by  section  2703  of  Title  18  and  financial  records  whose  production  is  covered  by  section  3402  of  Title  12.  Rather,  this  statute  is  to  be  construed  and  applied  consistent  with  such existing statutes.  Sixth,  the  statute  requires  the  Marshals  Service  to  report  to  the  Attorney  General  quarterly  regarding  the  number  of  administrative subpoenas issued, and this report will  be submitted to the Congress.

BARBARA  LEE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, May 2, 2000 Ms.  LEE.  Mr.  Speaker,  please  following article  into  the RECORD. submit  the [From the Washington Post, Sun. Apr. 30, 2000] AIDS  IS DECLARED THREAT TO WHITE HOUSE FEARS EPIDEMIC WORLD STABILIZE SECURITY\u2014 COULD DE(By Barton Gellman) Convinced  that  the  global  spread  of  AIDS is  reaching  catastrophic  dimensions,  the Clinton  administration  has  formally  designated  the  disease  for  the  first  time  as  a threat  to  U.S.  national  security  that  could topple  foreign  governments,  touch  off  ethnic wars  and  undo  decades  of  work  in  building free-market democracies abroad. The  National  Security  Council,  which  has never  before  been  involved  in  combating  an infectious  disease,  is  directing  a  rapid  reassessment  of  the  government\u2019s  efforts.  The new push is reflected in the doubling of budget requests\u2014to $254 million\u2014to combat AIDS overseas  and  in  the  creation  on  Feb.  8  of  a White House interagency working group. The group  has  been  instructed  to  \u2018\u2018develop  a  series  of  expanded  initiatives  to  drive  the international efforts\u2019\u2019  to combat  the disease. Top  officials  and  some  members  of  Congress contemplate much higher spending levels. The urgency of addressing AIDS has also touched  off  internal  disputes  over  long-settled  positions  on  trade  policy  and  on  legal requirements  that  aid  contractors  buy  only American supplies. The new  effort\u2014described  by  its  architects as tardy and not commensurate with the size of  the  crisis\u2014was  spurred  last  year  by  U.S. intelligence  reports  that  looked  at  the pandemic\u2019s  broadest  consequences  for  foreign  governments  and  societies,  particularly in  Africa.  A  National  Intelligence  Estimate prepared  in  January,  representing  consensus among  government  analysts,  projected  that a  quarter  of  southern  Africa\u2019s  population  is likely to die of AIDS and that the number of people  dying  of  the  disease  will  rise  for  a decade  before  there  is  much  prospect  of  improvement.  Based  on  current  trends,  that disastrous  course  could  be  repeated,  perhaps exceeded,  in  south  Asia  and  the  former  Soviet Union. \u2018\u2018At  least  some  of  the  hardest-hit  countries,  initially  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  and later  in  other  regions,  will  face  a  demographic  catastrophe\u2019\u2019  over  the  next  20  years, the study said. \u2018\u2018This will further impoverish the  poor  and  often  the  middle  class  and produce  a  huge  and  impoverished  orphan  cohort unable to cope and vulnerable to exploitation and radicalization.\u2019\u2019 Dramatic  declines  in  life  expectancy,  the study  said,  are  the  strongest  risk  factor  for \u2018\u2018revolutionary  wars,  ethnic  wars,  genocides and disruptive regime transitions\u2019\u2019 in the developing  world.  Based  on  historical  analysis of  75  factors  that  tend  to  destabilize  governments,  the  authors  said  the  social  consequences of AIDS appear to have \u2018\u2018a particularly  strong  correlation  with  the  likelihood of state failure in partial democracies.\u2019\u2019 Another mobilizing factor is American politics.  African  American  leaders,  such  as former representative Ron Dellums (D-Calif.) and  Rep.  Jesse  L.  Jackson  Jr.  (D-Ill),  have adopted  the  cause  of  AIDS  in  Africa.  Their interest  is  converging  with  that  of  longstanding AIDS activists  in the United States and Europe, where the course of the epidemic has  been  slowed  by  preventive  efforts  and life-saving  combinations  of  anti-retroviral drugs.  They  are  angry  at  policies  that  price those  medicines  beyond  the  reach  of  the  developing world. In  June,  those  activists  disrupted  Vice President  Gore\u2019s  presidential  campaign  announcement  in  Carthage,  Tenn.,  and  two other  speeches  that  week\u2014\u2018\u2018blindsiding  us completely,\u2019\u2019  as  one  senior  adviser  put  it. The  activists,  and  several  senior  Clinton  administration  officials,  say  that  pressure  accelerated the White House\u2019s response. There  is  no  recent  precedent  for  treating disease  as  a  security  threat.  So  unfamiliar are  public  health  agencies  with  the  apparatus of national defense that one early task force  meeting  was  delayed  when  co-chairwoman Sandra Thurman, whose Office of National  AIDS  Policy  is  across  the  street  from the  White  House,  could  not  find  the  Situation Room. For  all  the  stakes  they  now  describe, Clinton  administration  officials  do  not  contemplate  addressing  them  on  a  scale  associated  with  traditional  security  priorities. Gore\u2019s  national  security  adviser,  Leon Fuerth,  freely  acknowledged  that  the  2001 budget  request  of  $254  million  to  combat AIDS  abroad\u2014a  sum  surpassed,  for  example, by  drone  aircraft  in  the  Pentagon  budget\u2014 provides  \u2018\u2018resources  that  are  inadequate  for the  task.\u2019\u2019  He  called  the  work  of  the  task force  \u2018\u2018an  iterative  process\u2019\u2019  aimed  at  slowing  the  plague\u2019s  rate  of  increase  and  alleviating  some  of  its  effects.  Before  this  year, federal  spending  on  AIDS  overseas  remained relatively flat. Other  officials  noted  that  the  United States  has  endorsed  U.N.  Secretary  General Kofi  Annan\u2019s  declared  five-year  goal  of  reducing  the  rate  of  new  infections  by  25  percent.  That  falls  close  to  the  CIA\u2019s  best-case, and  least  probable,  scenario.  Because  such  a turn  of  events  would  demand  resources  from U.S. allies and multinational bodies, the new White  House  group  has  been  instructed  to \u2018\u2018develop  a  series  of  expanded  initiatives  to drive the international efforts.\u2019\u2019 Fuerth,  a  member  of  the  \u2018\u2018principals  committee\u2019\u2019  that  takes  up  the  most  important foreign policy questions, told representatives from  16  agencies  on  Feb.  8  that  the  panel wanted  a  package  of  proposals  for  Clinton within  several  weeks.  The  working  group  is scheduled  to  finish  drafting  its  proposals  in May.  Fuerth  said  the  government  is  looking for  \u2018\u2018the  kind  of  focus  and  coordination  on this  issue  that we  normally  strive  for  on  national security issues.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The numbers of people who are dying, the impact  on  elites\u2014like  the  army,  the  educated  people,  the  teachers\u2014is  quite  severe,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018In the end it was a kind of slow-motion  destruction  of  everything  we  were  trying,  in  our  contact  programs  and  our  military-to-military  programs,  to  build  up,  and would  affect  the  viability  of  these  societies, would  affect  the  stability  of  the  region. . . . In the world that we\u2019re facing, the destiny of the  continent  of Africa matters. And  it  isn\u2019t as  if  this  disease  is  going  to  stay  put  in  subSaharan Africa.\u2019\u2019 Twenty-three  million  people  are  infected in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  with  new  infections coming at the rate of roughly 5,000 a day, according  to  World  Health  Organization  figures.  Of  13 million  deaths  to  date,  11 million have  been  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.  In  the  developing world, the disease spreads primarily through heterosexual contact. The  intelligence  estimate  portrays  the pandemic  as  the  bad  side  of  globalization. Accelerating  trade  and  travel\u2014along  with underlying  conditions  favorable  to  the  disease\u2014are pushing much of Asia, and particularly  India,  toward  \u2018\u2018a  dramatic  increase  in infectious  disease  deaths,  largely  driven  by the spread of HIV/AIDS,\u2019\u2019 the intelligence report  said.  \u2018\u2018By  2010,  the  region  could  surpass Africa in the number of HIV infections.\u2019\u2019 The number  of  infections  now  is  relatively  low, but the growth rate  is high and governments have been slow to respond. Infections  are  also  growing  rapidly,  and largely  unchecked,  in  the  former  Soviet Union  and  Eastern  Europe.  The  intelligence estimate  said  this  growth  will  \u2018\u2018challenge democratic  development  and  transitions  and possibly  contribute  to  humaniarian  emergencies  and  military  conflicts  to  which  the United States may need to respond.\u2019\u2019 The report  also  anticipates  that  \u2018\u2018infectious  disease-related  trade  embargoes  and  restrictions  on  travel  and  immigration  also  will cause  frictions  among  and  with  key  trading partners and other selected states.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The  thing  that\u2019s  most  staggering,  and people are  just begnning to grasp,  is that Africa is the tip of the iceberg,\u2019\u2019 Thurman said. \u2018\u2018We  are  just  at  the  beginning  of  a  pandemic the  likes  of  which  we  have  not  seen  in  this century,  and  in  the  end  will  probably  never have seen in history.\u2019\u2019 Senior  administration  officials,  some  of them  apparently  frustrated,  said  that  the government  does  not  dispute  estimates  by the  Joint  United  Nations  Program  on  HIV/ AIDS  that  it  would  take  nearly  $2  billion  to fund  adequate  prevention  in  Africa,  and  a like  sum  for  treatment.  What  the  United States  has  been  spending,  by  contrast,  \u2018\u2018is  a rounding  error  for  county  budgets\u2019\u2019  in  Fairfax  and  Montgomery  counties,  said  one  disgusted official. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t have a  fantasy that we\u2019re going to go to the Hill and get $5 billion to build Africa\u2019s  health  care  infrastructure,\u2019\u2019  said  one senior  Africa  policymaker.  \u2018\u2018We\u2019re  trying  to determine  effective  steps  that  need  to  be taken, and can be taken, right now.\u2019\u2019 After  initial  resistance  from  U.S.  Trade Representative  Charlene  Barshefsky,  the government  has  agreed  in  principle  to  encourage  cheaper  access  to  life-saving  drugs by  relaxing  hard-line  positions  that  protect U.S. drugmakers\u2019  intellectual property. Gore has said publicly that the United States does not  rule  out  the use  by  afflicted  countries  of locally  made  or  imported  generics  of  drugs under  patent  by  American  companies.  Assistant  Trade  Representative  Joseph Papovich  has  written  to  the  governments  of Thailand  and  South  Africa  with  new  formulas for resolving intellectual property disputes on such medicines. But several participants in the government effort  said  the  practical  meaning  of  the change,  if any, will have to be decided at the Cabinet  level  or  by  Clinton  personally.  An early  test  comes  in  May,  when  Barshefsky\u2019s office  decides  whether  South  Africa  should be  removed  from  the  \u2018\u2018watch  list\u2019\u2019  of  countries  facing  potential  trade  sanctions.  South Africa  is  on  that  list  because  it  passed  a  law the  United  States  initially  described  as threatening  to  the  intellectual  property  of American drug manufacturers. With  the  prospect  of  substantial  new spending,  agencies  ranging  from  the  Centers for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC) and  National  Institutes  of  Health  to  the Labor Department are fighting over the allocation  of  funds.  Undersecretary  of  State Frank  Loy,  meanwhile,  is  said  by  participants to be resisting the emerging consensus that  the  international AIDS  effort  should  be centered in Thurman\u2019s office. The  task  force  has  also  battled  over  proposals  to  amend  the Foreign Assistance Act, which  requires  all  taxpayer-funded  aid  to come from American suppliers. Public health agencies  want  exceptions  for  condoms  and AIDS  test  kits,  which  can  be  acquired  more VerDate 27<APR>2000 05:48 May 09, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A08MY8.004 pfrm13 PsN: E08PT1 ",

So  it  seems  to  me  that  the gentleman is going to have an adequate opportunity  to  offer  the  amendments. We  will  make  a  point  of  order  because they do not have offsets as our rules require.  This  does  define  the  difference between  the  two  parties.  We  are  responsible for the bottom line. Ms.  SLAUGHTER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I yield  30  seconds  to  the  gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY). Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker,  I would simply  say  in  response  that  yes,  we  can offer  the  amendments,  we  just  cannot get  votes  on  them.  That  does  not  help a whole lot. Secondly,  they are offset. We  suggest that  we  pay  for  them  by  cutting  back tax  plans  by  20  percent.  If  we  cut  the outlays on the tax plans by $2.4 billion, we  can  pay  for  every  single  one  of  the amendments  we  would  like  to  have votes on. Ms.  PRYCE  of  Ohio.  Mr.  Speaker,  I yield  3 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from Pennsylvania  (Mr.  the  distinguished  chairman  of  the  Committee on Education and the Workforce. Mr.  GOODLING.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am very proud to be  in  the well  supporting the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  PORTER).  I  am  very  proud  to  be  here  supporting  him  for  the  last  4  years.  I  will tell  the  minority  leader  why  you  are going  to  bring  in  200,000  people  from other  countries. For  20 years  I  sat here in  the  minority,  and  the  only  thing  I ever  heard  from  the  majority  was quantity,  quantity.  No  quality.  No quality.  The  only  thing  they  ever talked  about  was  quantity.  If  we  can just cover more children, if we can just have  more  programs,  if  we  just  spend more  money.  Nobody  ever  went  out  to see  whether  they  were  doing  any  good, so we spent $140 billion in title I. So  what  do  we  have  now?  Do  you close the achievement gap? No, Mr. Minority  Leader,  you  did  not  close  the achievement gap one bit. In fact, it has increased.  So  for  the  first  time  in  the last  4  or  5  years  we  have  been  talking about  quality,  not  quantity.  We  have been talking about results, not process. Every  time  they  would  come  and  say we  need  more  money,  and  I  would  say, for  what,  they  would  say,  to  cover more  children,  and  I  say,  with  what, mediocrity?  You  are  not  helping  them. So  yes,  now we  have  the  highest Pell grants;  and  yes,  now  we  have  the  lowest  interest  rates.  Yes,  now  we  have more money for college work study, all of  these  things.  We  also  took  166  jobtraining  programs  spread  out  over every  agency  doing  nothing  to  prepare our  people,  because  there  was  so  little money  and  so  many  programs.  But again,  it  was  the  same  mindset:  more programs,  more  programs,  and  somehow  or  other,  all  of  our  problems  will go away. Well,  we  have  changed  this.  We  are now  moving  toward  quality,  not  quantity.  We  are  now  moving  toward  results,  not  process;  and  we  are  going  to see a big difference. PORTER)  So  again,  I  am  proud  to  be  here  supporting  the  gentleman  from  Illinois (Mr. PORTER)  in this effort. We want to close  that  achievement  gap.  More money  for Even  Start, more money  for Head  Start;  but  we  reformed  Head Start.  For  10  years  we  heard,  more money  for  Head  Start,  more  money, but  nobody  said,  are  we  accomplishing anything? Lo and behold, we discovered all  over  this  country  we  were  accomplishing  very  little  to  get  them  reading-ready to go  to  school. Now we have changed  that,  and  so  the  word  is  quality.  The  word  is  also  family  literacy. For  the  first  time  we  are  now  talking about  if  we  are  going  to  break  the cycle, we deal with the entire family. So  again,  we  are  on  the  right  road, and  thanks  to  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  for  the  last  several years we have been moving in the right direction.  The  whole  emphasis  is  on quality,  not  quantity;  results,  not process. Ms.  SLAUGHTER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I yield  2 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. EVANS). Mr.  EVANS.  Mr.  Speaker,  we  should reject  this  appropriations  bill  which turns  its  back  on  our  children  and  our veterans.  It  demonstrates  a  lack  of commitment  to  our  Nation\u2019s  veterans which  we  should  not  stand  for,  but maybe  even  more  troubling  is  the  degree  to  which  this  grossly  underfunds Federal education programs. The  Republican  bill  is  a  giant  step backward  for  American  education.  It eliminates  funding  for  two  programs that are critical for giving students the tools  they  need  to  flourish:  the  class size  reduction  initiative  and  the  Elementary  School  Counselors  Demonstration Act.  Over  the  next  10  years, we  will  need  2.2  million  new  teachers nationwide  to  keep  pace  with  enrollment.  The  Republicans  want  to  play politics  with  children  and  slash  the Democratic  initiative  to  hire  100,000 additional  teachers.  This  will  jeopardize more than 1,000 teachers already hired  in  my  home  State  of  Illinois;  it will  leave  kids  packed  in  overcrowded classrooms. The  elimination  of  the  Elementary School  Counseling  Demonstration  program  will  deny  counseling  services  to more  than  100,000  elementary  students. These  essential  services  help  troubled students  overcome  problems,  promoting  the  mental  health  of  our  students  and  the  safety  of  our  schools.  In April,  I  was  joined  by  over  80 Members in  calling  for  the  funding  of  the  school counselor  program  at  $100  million  in fiscal  year  2001.  In  addition,  the  bipartisan  Working  Group  on  Youth  Violence  recommended  that  we  fund school  counselor  programs  to  help  reduce  school  violence.  Despite  the  support and to the detriment of the school safety and our children\u2019s well-being, no funding  was  provided  for  this  initiative. Mr.  Speaker,  at  this  time  I  will  include  the  Working  Group\u2019s  report  and the  letter  to  the  appropriators  for  the RECORD.

V. SCHOOLS. Findings C.  Often  one  adult  can  make  a  difference by  taking  an  interest  in  a  child  and  nurturing  him  or  her.  This  might  be  a  teacher, an administrator, a counselor, or others. Students  with  behavior  disorders  account  for a  majority  of  problems  encountered  in  schools today.  Additional  resource  staff  in  our  schools, such as counselors, school psychologists, and social  workers  are  needed,  not  only  to  help  identify  these  troubled  youth,  but  to work  on  development skill building. (Emphasis added.) There  is  no  real  infrastructure  of  support for  our  kids when  it  comes  to mental  health services  in  our  schools  and  no  national models  for  how  best  to  structure  school  community  mental  health  programs.  Currently, there  are  only  90,000  school  counselors  for approximately  41.4  million  students  in  our public schools\u2014roughly 1 counselor for every 513  students.  In  California,  there  is  only  one counselor  for more  than  1,000  students.  That is  simply  not  enough.  As  Mr.  Porter  stated during  this  presentation,  current  school counselors  are  unable  to  address  students\u2019 mental  health  needs  since  they  are  responsible  for  such  large  numbers  of  students.  Instead,  their  role  is  relegated  to  administrative, scheduling, and career counseling Additional  resource  staff  is  needed  to  address  specifically  the  personal,  family,  peer level, emotional, and developmental needs of students. By focusing on these mental health needs, these staff members will pick up early warning signs of troubled youth and  improve student interaction and school safety. The  resource  staff  can  also  provide  consultation  with  teachers  and  parents  about student  learning,  behavior  and  emotional problems.  They  can  develop  and  implement prevention  programs,  deal  with  substance abuse,  set  up  peer  mediation,  and  enhance problem-solving  skills  in  schools.  In  short, resource  staff can provide  important  support services to students, parents, and teachers. There are a number of different ways to enhance  the  availability  of  emotional  support and  mental  health  services  in  schools. Schools  can  partner  with  community-based mental health organizations or enhance staff training  by  providing  more  opportunities  at school  for  the  development  of  informal adult-child  mentoring  relationships.  We  expect  that  there  are  a  number  of models  that may  vary  in  effectiveness  at  different schools  and  age  levels.  The  federal  government  should  initially  support  the  development  of  research-based  models  for  school mental  health  programs  that  could  then  be built upon. Furthermore,  schools  and  communities should  incorporate  programs  that  encourage parents  to  become  involved  in  their  child\u2019s educaiton.  Improving  parenting  skills through  federally-funded  programs  like WAC,  TANF,  Food  Stamps,  Medicaid,  public health  clinics,  teen  parenting,  child  welfare, juvenile  delinquency  and  homeless  programs may  be  an  effective  way  to  reduce  juvenile violence in the long term. Finally,  teacher quality has been  shown  to have  a  profound  impact  on  the  success  of  a VerDate 01-JUN-2000 01:47 Jun 09, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K08JN7.017 pfrm09 PsN: H08PT1 ",
            "15": "June 8, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:69) H4057 it  is  an  honest put  our  resources,  and  difference of opinion. The folks on this side of the aisle put as  their  first  priority  providing  over $700  billion  in  tax  cuts. We  have  put  as our  first  priority  investing  that money in  Social  Security  and  Medicare  and education,  in  health  care,  in  job  training,  in  basic  science  to  keep  this  economy going and to build opportunity. As  great  as  this  country  is,  it  can  be better.  But  to  be  better,  we  have  to continue  to  make  the  right  kind  of public  investments that have gotten us this glorious economic recovery. We  are  not  going  to  do  it  under  this bill.  We  are  not  going  to  do  it  under the  science  bill  that  came  out  of  committee yesterday. We not going to do it out of  the agriculture bill. At  least not now. We  will  do  it  eventually.  We  will  do it  in  September,  because  in  September we will  get  to  the  get-real  time  part  of this  session,  and  that  is  when  the  majority  will  finally  face  up  to  the  fact that  this  bill  and  most  of  the  others are not going to be signed by the President  of  the  United  States  unless  additional  resources  are  put  in  it.  And  if you  say,  \u2018\u2018Oh,  they  are  not  offset,  you are  just  trying  to  spend money,\u2019\u2019  every single  one  of  the  amendments  that  we want  the  committee  to  adopt  can  be paid  for  if  the  majority  simply  cuts back  on  the  size  of  its  tax  package  by about 20 percent. That  is  all  it  would  take.  It  would still  leave  you  room  for  significant  tax cuts,  and we will  have  one  on  the  floor tomorrow  that  will  demonstrate  that, but it will not provide tax cuts that are so  large  that  you  get  in  the  way  of  either  deficit  reduction  or  making  the needed  investments  we  need  to  make on our people. So  that  is  what  is  at  stake  on  this bill.  I  would  urge  Members  at  the  end of  the day  to vote no because  it  simply does  not  measure  up  to  what  America is all about. Mr.  PORTER.  Mr.  Chairman,  may  I inquire of the Chair how much time remains on each side. The  CHAIRMAN  pro  tempore  (Mr. PEASE).  The  gentleman  from  Illinois (Mr.  has  181\u20442 minutes  remaining.  The  gentleman  from  Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY) has 21 minutes remaining. Mr. PORTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER). (Ms.  GRANGER  asked  for  and  was given  permission  to  revise  and  extend her remarks.) Ms.  GRANGER.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise today  in  strong  support  of  the  Labor, Health  and  Human  Services,  and  Education  Appropriations  bill.  This  legislation  includes  substantial  increases for  many  important  health,  education, and job training programs. I  also  want  to  commend  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Chairman  PORfor  the  work  he  has  done.  I  want to  especially  thank  him  for  his  commitment  to  increased  funding  for  the National  Institutes  of  Health.  I  am PORTER)  TER)  proud  to  be  a  member  of  the  Committee  on  Appropriations  and  a  Congress  that  have  made  quality  health care a priority. From  1995  to  2001,  Republicans  have increased NIH funding by an average of 11 percent per year,  15 percent per year in the last 3 years. I am also pleased  to say we have provided  a  33  percent  increase  in  the amount  of  awards.  This  funding  boosts hope  and  opportunity  for  patients across  this  Nation.  With  this  money, we  will  continue  to  lead  the  world  in our  quest  for  cures  for  Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s,  diabetes,  cancer,  and other  diseases  that  wreck  families  and cause loss of quality of life for our citizens. Mr. Chairman, as a woman, a mother, and a member of the Committee on Appropriations,  I  am  pleased  to  be  a  part of  this  historic  NIH  increase.  I  think this  is  an  important  day  for  patients and, also, quality of care. Mr.  OBEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield  3 minutes  to  the  distinguished  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. ROEMER). (Mr.  ROEMER  asked  and  was  given permission  to  revise  and  extend  his  remarks.) Mr.  ROEMER.  Mr.  Chairman,  at  a time  over  the  last  few  days  when  we have  listened  to  such  prominent  leaders in our business community like Bill Gates  at  Microsoft  and  Andrew  Groves at  Intel  and  Carly  Feorina  at  HewlettPackard  say  that  we  need  to  do  more in  terms  of  quality  in  education,  we need  to  do more  in  terms  of  new  ideas, we  need  to  do  more  in  terms  of  technology, we need  to do more  in  terms of training  our  teachers  to  learn  how  to use  the  technology.  This  bill  does  less. At  a  time  when  we  are  facing  a  new economy  with  new  challenges  in  the digital  divide  with  some  of  our  students,  if  they  are  black  or  Hispanic, not  having  equal  access  with  this  digital  divide  to  the  latest  technology, we are  doing  less  at  a  time  when,  according  to  the  Wall  Street  Journal  a  few weeks ago, schools are turning to temp agencies  for  substitute  teachers,  and  it quotes  the  Kelly  Services  going  out into  the  community  to  put  substitute teachers into our schools. Now,  I  think  the  quality  of  teaching is  the  single  biggest  need  in  this  country  because  we  will  need  2 million  new teachers, but we have to make sure the current  teachers  can  teach  with  the challenges  of  the  technology  that  are before  them.  Temp  agencies  might  be able  to  do  some  good  things,  but  I  am not  sure  that  one  of  their  strengths  is putting  qualified  teachers  in  our schools. So what I would hope in this bill that I  would  recommend  at  this  point  a  no vote  on  is  that  it  falls  short,  particularly in the Title I area, where I offered an  amendment  on  the  authorization process  to  increase  Title  I  by  $1.5  billion,  39  Republicans  voted  with  that amendment.  This  bill  does  not  reflect that  increase  to  $9.8  billion  for  Title  I kids. on  TIAHRT),  So the Title I program does not come up  to  the  funding  that we  even  authorized  with  bipartisan  support  for  some of  the  poorest  of  the  poor  children  in some  of  the  poorest  school  districts  in the country. The  second  major  reason  to  vote against  this  bill  is  the  lack  of  professional  development.  Now,  with  the Teacher  Empowerment  Act  not  being authorized  and  with  the  Eisenhower Program  not  being  funded  in  this  bill, we  have  a  huge  gaping  hole  on  one  of the  biggest  needs  in  America  today, and  that  is  making  sure  we  have  quality  teachers  who  can  work  with  the technology,  work  with  overcrowded schools,  work  in  overcrowded  classrooms,  and  teach  effectively  to  20  or  25 or 28 or 30 kids. So  Title  I  is  underfunded  for  the poorest  schools.  Professional  development,  there  is  a  huge  gaping  hole  in this bill without an authorization process  taking  place.  When  we  need  to  do more,  we  are  doing  less  in  education.  I would encourage a no vote. Mr.  PORTER.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am pleased  to  yield  1  minute  to  the  gentleman  from  Kansas  (Mr.  a member  of  the  full  Committee  Appropriations. Mr.  TIAHRT.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  want to  thank  the  gentleman  from  Illinois (Chairman PORTER) for the opportunity to speak in favor of this bill. Mr.  Chairman,  the  gentleman  from Wisconsin  (Mr.  OBEY)  said  earlier  that we  have  this  tax  cut  and  if  we  did  not have  this  tax  cut  we  could  spend  more money on education. Well,  there  is  a  difference  in  philosophy here. We have overpaid the cost of government.  I  do  believe  that  the  taxpayers deserve a break. We could spend more,  but  let  us  look  at  what  is  included in this bill. In  this  bill,  we  have  an  overall  increase  of  7.6  percent.  That  exceeds  inflation. But a portion of  this  is mandatory,  and  we  have  to  increase  it  a  certain  amount. But  if we  look  at  the  discretionary portion that we have the opportunity  to  either  increase  or  decrease,  the  discretionary  portion  is  increasing nearly 15 percent. Pell  Grants,  for  example,  are  going from  $2,300  in  1994  to  $3,500  in  this  bill. It  is  over  a  50-percent  increase  since 1994. We  are  doing  some  wonderful  things in  this  bill.  I  think  the  body  ought  to take  that  into  consideration.  The  priorities  may  be  different,  but  it  is  a good bill and I urge its passage. Mr.  OBEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield  31\u20442 minutes  to  the  gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. LOWEY). Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in opposition  to  this  bill,  but  I  do  so with great sadness because I have such great respect  for  my  friend,  the  gentleman from  Illinois  (Mr.  our  chairman,  who  has  been  such  an  extraordinary  leader  in  this  House  from  his commitment  and  his  passion  to  the NIH budget, to his initiative to produce better health outcomes  for our kids,  to PORTER),  VerDate 01-JUN-2000 02:15 Jun 09, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K08JN7.119 pfrm09 PsN: H08PT1 ",
            "23": "June 8, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:69) H4065 and  prevented  more  effectively  through  new medical  procedures  and  therapies.  Nearly completed  research  on  the  deciphering  the human  genome  will  literally  transform  the practice of medicine. Despite  these  extraordinary  advances  that have  made  to  fight  disease  over  the  past  century,  serious  health  challenges  still  exist. Chronic  diseases  such  as  diabetes,  Parkinson\u2019s,  Alzheimer\u2019s,  heart  disease,  cancer  and stroke  still  pose  enormous  social  and  economic  burdens  to  families  throughout  the world. Researchers  in  the United States, working  through  the  NIH,  are  on  the  verge  of  finding  cures  for  many  diseases  that  still  affect millions  of  people,  but  the  key  is  funding  to unlock  the  knowledge  we  need  to  find  these cures. The  economic  costs  of  illness  in  the  United States  alone  are  approximately  three  trillion dollars  annually.  This  represents  31%  of  the nation\u2019s  Gross  Domestic  Product.  While  this research has  spawned  the biotechnology  revolution,  the  future  of  that  industry  is  dependent upon  the  continued advances  in biomedical  research  by  the  NIH.  It  is  estimated  that  an  investment  of  one  billion  dollars  in  NIH  research saves  approximately  forty  billion  dollars  in  future  health  care  costs.  One  single  breakthrough  can  lead  to  spectacular  financial  savings  for  American  families  who  face  the  burden of  increasing health  care  costs. While  past  accomplishments  are  helping  to find  cures  for  the  major  illnesses  of  today,  we must  also  look  to  the  future  challenges  and benefits  that  increased  funding  for  biomedical research  will  provide.  It  is  estimated  that  by 2025,  one  out  of  every  five  Americans  will  be over  the  age  of  65.  Because  most  of  the chronic  diseases  and  disabilities  we  face  are associated with  aging,  it  is  vital  that we  double our  research  efforts.  We  must  make  the  investment  in  research  now  to  plan  for  the  anticipated  increase  in  the  population  of  older Americans  and  to  contain  health  care  costs.  In addition,  the  cost  of  illness  threatens  to  rise because  these  diseases  are  constantly  evolving  to  combat  our  own  advances.  Dangerous bacteria  are  growing  more  resistant  to  every new  round  of  antibiotics  that  our  researchers can  discover.  We  must  keep  increasing  funding  for  NIH  to  keep  pace  with  the  evolving face of disease. Medical  research  represents  the  single most effective  weapon  we  have  to  combat healthcare  challenges  today  and  in  the  future. We  must  build  on  the  tremendous  advances we  have  made  in  conquering  and  preventing disease  by  accelerating  the momentum  behind our  medical  research  efforts.  Therefore,  increasing  the  funding  for  the  National  Institutes of  Health  should  remain  a  top  Congressional priority. Two  years  ago, Congress  pledged  to  double the  NIH  budget  over  a  five  year  period.  Since then,  Congress  has  increased  the  NIH  budget by  15%  each  of  the  last  two  years.  It  is  now time  for  Congress  to  take  the  third  step  by providing  another  15%  increase,  continuing  us on  that  path.  This  requires  a  $2.7  billion  increase,  which  would  bring  the  NIH  budget  to $20.5  billion  in  FY  2001.  We  must  stay  on track  to  double  the  NIH  budget  by  2003.  This is  an  investment  that  will  dramatically  improve the  lives  of  countless  Americans  now  and  for years  to  come. Through  this  third  down  payment  towards doubling  the  NIH  budget,  we  look  forward  to enhanced  research  in  some  of  the  areas  that have  been  presented  at  briefings  to  the  Congressional  Biomedical  Research  Caucus, which  I  co-chair.  In  fact,  the  increased  investments  that  have  recently  been  made  are  already  leading  to  fundamental  breakthroughs  in the  fight  against  disease.  One  exciting  illustration  of  the  results  of  this  new  research  comes from  recent  progress  on  the  development  of new  \u2018\u2018gene-chip\u2019\u2019  technologies,  which  can  be used  to  generate  genetic  fingerprints  that measure  what  genes  are  turned  on  or  turned off  in  certain  types  of  cancers.  In  the  past year, American  scientists  have  used  gene  chip technology  to  discover  that  several  cancers that  were  once  indistinguishable  with  standard diagnostic  methods  can  now  be  distinguished by  their  genetic  fingerprints.  In  one  striking case,  a  type  of  cancer with  highly  variable  outcomes  has  suddenly  been  recognized  to  be two  different  diseases.  One  type  is  aggressive and  quickly  fatal,  the  other  is  slower  with  a likelihood  of  longer  survival.  Thus,  it  may  now be  possible  to  identify  patients  with  these  two types  of  cancer  and  treat  them  differently  with more appropriate  therapies. Similarly,  substantial  new  investments  in  biological  computing  and  a  new  area  called bioinformatics  are  catalyzing  the  fusion  of  clinical  medicine,  genetics,  and  information science.  This  important  work  will  help  us  understand  how  each  of  our  unique  genetic  constitutions  predisposes  us  to  different  diseases and  clinical outcomes. A  final  example  comes  from  new  investment in  bioengineering.  Important  new  understanding  of  organ  physiology,  and  cell  growth is  emerging  rapidly.  In  the  coming  years,  we expect  that  new  research  in  these  areas,  stimulated  by  increased  funding,  will  lead  to  the construction of new heart,  liver, and pancreatic tissue  for  those  who  wait  for  transplants  or  tissue-based  therapy. I  will  support  this  bill  with  the  knowledge that  this  Congress  will  do  everything  in  its power  to  continue  the  effort  to  double  the  investment  in  the  NIH  over  the  next  five  years. Mr.  LEVIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  they  say  that  in politics,  where  you  stand  depends  on  where you  sit.  But  the  Labor-HHS-Education  Appropriations  bill  the  Republican  leadership  has brought  to  the  floor  looks  bad  from  every  seat in  the House. The  bill  fails  our  kids.  It  would  undo  the progress  we\u2019ve  made  toward  improving  the quality  of  education  for  every  child  by  eliminating  funding  for  the  President\u2019s  plan  to  hire 100,000  teachers,  a  plan  we  made  a  bipartisan  down  payment  on  last  year.  It would  also force  our  children  and  teachers  to  continue working  in  overcrowded  schools  with  leaky roofs and  crumbling buildings, because  this bill provides  no  funding  for  the  President\u2019s  school construction  initiative.  Finally,  it  provides  ten percent  less  funding  than  the  President  requested  for  Head  Start,  guaranteeing  that  we will  not  be  able  to  provide  preschool  education to all  children who need  it. The  bill  fails  families.  The  Baby  Boomers are  often  called  the  \u2018\u2018sandwich  generation\u2019\u2019  because  they often have  to  care  for  their  children and  their  elderly  parents.  This  bill  fails  those caregivers  at  both  ends.  It  denies  funding  for the  Family  Caregiver  Program,  which  provides support  for  250,000  Americans  who  care  for elderly  or  disabled  relatives  at  home.  It  also cuts  in  half  the  President\u2019s  increase  in  funding for  child  care,  which  will  prevent  80,000  eligible  families  from  getting  help  with  child  care. The  bill  fails  senior  citizens.  This  bill  shortchanges  important  senior  programs  like Meals-on-Wheels.  It  also  shows  the  Republican  Party\u2019s  true  colors  on  Medicare  and  Social  Security  by  slashing  funding  for  the  Social Security  Administration  and  the  Health  Care Financing  Administration.  Those  agencies make  sure  seniors  get  their  Social  Security checks  on  time  and  receive  the  health  care they\u2019re  entitled  to.  Cutting  the  budgets  of agencies  that  do  this  important  work  puts  all seniors at  risk. The  bill  fails  workers.  This  bill  would,  for  the sixth  year  in  a  row,  delay  a  Department  of Labor  regulation  which  would  help  to  prevent 300,000  workers  from  being  injured  at  work. Neither  does  it  provide  enough  funding  to  operate  the  Unemployment  Insurance  program, which  protects  workers  who  lose  their  jobs.  It cuts  funding  for  worker  training  programs  that help  people  get  better-paying  jobs  with  benefits. The  bill  fails  millions  of  Americans  who  suffer  from  deadly  diseases.  Over  the  past  3 years,  Congress  has  made  three  installments on  a  bipartisan  promise  to  double  funding  for the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH),  the  primary  source  of  medical  research  in  the  United States.  This  year\u2019s  increase  is  only  six  percent,  far  less  than  the  fifteen  percent  increase needed  to  reach our goal  in  five  years. Finally,  the  bill  fails  the  taxpayers.  Over  the past  few  years,  the  Department  of  Health  and Human  Services  had  dramatically  reduced fraud  and  waste  in  the  Medicare  program. This  bill  slashes  funding  for  HHS\u2019  anti-fraud activities. The  supreme  irony  here  is  that  while  the Republican  Party  is  denying  necessary  funding  for  education,  medical  research  and  seniors,  they  plan  to  bring  a  tax  bill  to  the  Floor tomorrow  that  showers  hundreds  of  billions  of dollars  in  tax  cuts  on  the  very  richest  people in  America.  What  does  this  say  about  the  Majority\u2019s priorities. This  bill  fails  kids,  families,  seniors,  workers, and  taxpayers.  It does not deserve  the  support of  the House, and  I urge  its defeat. Mr.  CLAY.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Republican leadership has once again  succeeded  in bringing  to  the  floor  a  Labor,  Health  and  Education Appropriations  bill  designed  to  please  only themselves  and  their  right-wing  friends.  H.R. 4577  fails  to  make  needed  investments  in public  education  and  the  domestic  workforce, and,  as  the  result,  would  undermine  American competitiveness  in  the  21st  century.  This  bill has  already  received  what  has  now  become its  customary  and  well-deserved  veto  threat from  the  Clinton  administration.  It  is  clearly going  nowhere,  and  should  be  soundly  defeated. This  bill  was  doomed  from  its  inception,  because  the  economic  premise  upon  which  it  is based  is  flawed.  Earlier  this  year,  before  the appropriations  process  began,  the  Republican leadership  decided  to  resume  its  efforts  to push  for  big  tax  cuts  for  the  rich.  They  attached  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  of  these tax  cuts  to  the  minimum  wage  bill  and  the budget  resolution.  This  decision  to  squander the  surplus,  rather  than  invest  it,  severely  reduced  the  funds  available  to meet many  of  our Nation\u2019s  critical needs. Overall,  the  bill  provides  $2.9  billion  less than  the  President  request  for  the  Department of  Education,  and  $1.7  billion  less  for  the  Department  of  Labor.

We  simply  feel  that  by  reason  of  the economy  growing  so  fast  and  unemployment being so low and employment being  so  high  that  there  is  simply  less demand  than  there  is  where  the  economy  is  not  performing  that  way  as  it has sometimes in the past. So  I  do  not  think  there  is  any  real disagreement  among  us  except  that  we feel that these are lower priorities than others  in  the  bill  given  our  need  to choose  priorities  given  this  very,  very strong economy. Mr.  Chairman,  I  my point of order. Mr.  STRICKLAND.  Mr.  Chairman,  I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of words. Mr.  Chairman,  sometimes  I  think that  those  of  us  who  serve  in  this Chamber need a reality check. I serve a county  where  the  unemployment  rate is  17.1  percent.  I  serve  multiple  counties  that  have  double  digit  unemployment.  That  is  why  I  rise  today  in strong  support  of  the  Jackson  amendment  to  restore  funding  for  programs that help jobless Americans. I guess some people think that things are  so  good  that  we  do  not  have  any dislocated  workers  to  worry  about.  I would  invite  the  gentleman  from Oklahoma  (Mr.  and  others  to  come to my district in southern Ohio and see the  conditions  there,  come  and  talk with one of the 800 coal miners who are about to lose their jobs in a region that suffers  10.5  percent  unemployment, miners who are awaiting word today on a  job-training  grant  they  view  as  their best hope for future employment. I  would  like  for  them  to  come  and talk  to  one  of  the  550  union  workers from the Goodyear plant who lost their jobs  last  summer  and  are  now  back  in school  thanks  to  a  Federal  dislocated workers  grant.  Without  further  education,  how  can  they  ever  expect  to land  a  job  in  a  county  with  an  unemployment rate over 11 percent? I  would  like  for  my  colleagues  here to  come  to  southern  Ohio  and  talk  to some  of  the  619  union  workers  from Ironton  Iron  who  lost  their  jobs  in March  and  who  just  recently  received word  that  there  would  be  trade  adjustment assistance for them. This  community  of  just  over  12,000 people  has  lost  over  1,200  jobs  in  the last year and a half. Ten percent of the entire  population  is  jobless.  Tell  them they do not deserve a second chance. I  would  like  for  my  colleagues  to come  to  southern  Ohio  and  visit  the Piketon  uranium  enrichment  facility and  talk  to  the  enrichment  workers who will  lose their  jobs next month because  this  Government  chose  to  privatize  their  industry.  Go  tell  them they are not a priority. Mr.  Speaker,  this  Nation  may  be doing  well;  but  there  are  people,  and many  of  them  are  in  my  district,  who to  be  got  ChairJACKSON)  STRICKLAND)  are  being  left  behind.  This  Congress should  not  be  funding  tax  cuts  for  the wealthy  and  at  the  same  time  cutting funds  for training  jobless workers.  It  is unconscionable. For  these  reasons,  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  the  Jackson  amendment. Mr.  JACKSON  of  Illinois.  Mr.  man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. STRICKLAND. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois. Mr.  JACKSON  of  Illinois.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  the  gentleman  for  yielding. Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  really  excited that the gentleman from southern Ohio (Mr.  came  to  the  floor today  to  make  the  case  for  support  of this amendment. Under  the  House  bill,  215,800  fewer  of the  3.3  million  workers  who  lose  their jobs through no  fault of their own each year  will  be  served  under  the  President\u2019s  request  of  $389  million  for  dislocated  worker  assistance,  which  my amendment, Mr.  Chairman,  restores  to the Labor, HHS mark. Mr.  Chairman,  every  time  I  come  to this  House  floor  and  offer  an  amendment  of  the  magnitude  that  we  are talking  about,  someone  inevitably says,  minorities  are  doing  better.  I mean,  here  comes  the  gentleman  from Illinois  (Mr.  to  the  House floor.  He  has  talking  about minorities. The  gentleman  does  not  represent  a district  primarily  of minorities,  but  he talked about counties where unemployment  in  his  congressional  district  are as high as 17 percent. 1445 I  was  hoping  that  the  gentleman would  please  expound  upon  what  the implications  of  this  increase  would  do for his congressional district. Mr.  STRICKLAND.  My  people  who have  lost their  jobs  through no  fault of their  own,  these  are  salt  of  the  earth people,  people  who  want  to  work,  who want  to  enjoy  the  American  life  as  we enjoy it here in this Chamber. Yet they are  being  deprived  oftentimes  of  getting  the  skills  they  need  to  enable them  to  go  out  and  to  compete.  These are  folks  who  have  worked  at  steel foundries,  they  have  worked  at  heavy manufacturing jobs. Those jobs are disappearing  from  my  district.  They  need to  go  back;  they  need  to  learn  how  to become  computer  literate.  They  need new  technological  skills.  Without them,  they  are  destined  to  be  jobless. We  just  simply  cannot  forget  those people.  I  applaud  the  fact  that we have a  booming  economy.  I  applaud  the  fact that  in  Redmond,  Washington,  I  have heard  some  of  the  average  salaries  are at  six  figures.  But  I  have  got  people who  are  struggling  to  survive.  This Congress  cannot  forget  those  Americans.  If  we  do,  we  are  being  negligent and  we  are  failing.  We  are  failing  not only  our  individual  constituents,  but we are failing this country. Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. I thank the gentleman  for  his  support  of  my amendment. a  conPORTER)  Mr.  PORTER.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  tinue to reserve my point of order. Mr. DAVIS of  Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I  move  to  strike  the  requisite  number of words. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Jackson  amendment  to  restore  $1.25 billion  for  skill  training  programs  at the  Department  of  Labor.  Last  week,  I joined over 200 young people  from a coalition  of  Alternative  Schools  Network, CCA Academy,  the Latino Alternative  School,  200  young  people  who were  marching  and  protesting.  They were  marching  and  protesting  the  reductions  of  millions  of  Federal  dollars allocated  to  skilled  training  programs for  at-risk  youth.  I,  along  with  the  200 people  there,  tossed  peanuts  around  to symbolize  the  small  amount  of  money being  allocated  to  skill  training  programs  and  the  Labor-HHS  appropriations bill. If  this  budget  appropriations  process was  a  poker  game,  we  would  have  to say  that  Labor-HHS  was  dealt  a  weak hand  but  still  had  to  play.  Therefore,  I believe  that  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  has  done  what  he could  with  faulty  deck  stacked against him. Mr.  Chairman,  these  people  were  not protesting  for  the  things  that  normal teenagers  are  often  concerned  about. Rather,  these  teenagers  were  protesting  for  the  opportunity  to  learn. They  were  protesting  for  the  opportunity  to  become  well-trained  workers and  the  opportunity  to make  contributions  to  this  Nation.  They  were  protesting  so  that we will  not  have  to  import  workers  from  foreign  countries  to take  care  of  skilled  job  opportunities that are needed. If we truly want to  improve the environment  of  those  less  fortunate  in  this society,  what  we  really  need  to  do  is provide  the  necessary  funding  this amendment  calls  for.  We  need  to  show our  communities  that  we  believe  that education  and  job  training  are  essential  tools  for  success.  We  need  to  show that we  understand what  it means  to  a community  when  the  businesses  are downsizing,  privatizing,  and  moving out  of  the  community  and  in many  instances  out  of  the  country,  obviously displacing  workers  and  increasing  the need  for  training  so  that  they  can  survive and participate. Therefore,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  urge  a vote  in  support  of  the  Jackson  amendment.  If  we  had  an  adequately  funded skill  training  program  as  well  as  an adequately  funded  Labor-HHS  appropriations bill, we could truly  fulfill our duty  to  help  build  a  society  where  no sick  person  would  go  unattended,  no hungry person would go unfed, no ablebodied  person  would  go  without  adequate  employment.  Mr.  Chairman,  we need  to  ante  up.  We  need  to  live  up  to our  promise,  live  up  to  our  duty,  live up to our responsibility and vote yes to the Jackson amendment. Mr.  PORTER.

Mr.  Speaker,  I  2  minutes  to  the  gentlewoman  Florida (Mrs. THURMAN). Mrs.  THURMAN.  Mr.  thank  the  gentleman  for  the time. Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  rising  in  strong opposition  to  the  rule,  primarily  because it has denied the gentleman from Texas  (Mr.  the  opportunity to  offer  an  amendment  that  I  believe was  meant  to  protect  Social  Security, Medicare,  and  debt  reduction.  In  fact, this was the same amendment that was offered on the CARIB bill that was  just for $3 billion on May 10. Now,  we  could  accept  it  on  that  one. Today  we  are  looking  at  a  bill  that  is going  to  cost  us  $50  billion  and  for about 45,000 people. Mr.  SUNUNU.  Mr.  gentlewoman yield? Mrs.  THURMAN.

They  agree  that  conservation  funding is  important.  I  commend  the  sponsors of  this  bill  on  that  point.  But  there  is a  very  important  condition.  They  do not  agree  that  we  should  raid  the  Social  Security  Trust  Fund.  They  have made  that  position  extremely  clear last  year  and  the  year  before.  They want  100  percent  of  the  surplus  set aside.  They  also  want  to  know  that Medicare  is  funded  and  solvent.  They have  made  that  very  clear.  They  want to  know  that  it  is  there  for  their health  care  as  seniors.  And  they  want to  know  that  the  public  debt  will  be paid off by the deadline of 2013.\u2019\u2019 Why  can  we  not  have  this  amendment? I do not understand that. I think we  should  vote  against  this  rule  and allow  the  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr. STENHOLM) to have his day. Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Indiana (Mr. BUYER). (Mr.  BUYER  asked  and  was  given permission  to  revise  and  extend  his  remarks.) Mr.  BUYER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  almost have to say that demagoguery is a serious ailment, an illness, to a democratic form  of  government.  It  is  unfortunate that  we  cannot  have  serious  dialogue and  debate  about  the  issue  that  we have. This is about a rule on the repeal of  the  death  tax.  It  is  not  about  campaign finance reform. I  served  here  under  the  minority  in the 39th and 40th year of Democrat rule when  this  House  was  a  sea  of  red  ink, the  debt  exploding,  deficits  as  far  as the  eye  could  see.  Now  they  are  trying to  claim  that  they  are  the  protectorates  of  the  treasury,  that  they  somehow are  the protectorates of Social Security when they took the Social Security  Trust  Fund  monies  to  grow  Government? That is absurd. What we have here  today  is  to  repeal the  death  tax.  This  is  long  overdue. This  tax  hits  individuals  who  have worked  hard  all  their  lives,  who  have worked  and  saved  in  their  efforts  to fulfill the American dream. My  constituent  from  Marion,  Indiana,  wrote  to  me  about  her  parents: \u2018\u2018My parents were  frugal and  saved any large sum of money they ever got their hands  on.  My  mother  taught  school. My father was a master pattern maker. They  will  were  products  of  the  Depression. They purchased  land  in Arkansas. And  now  their  estate  looks  to  total over  $1  million.  Now  this  estate  is forced  with  a  39-percent  estate  tax. What a disgrace. Surely we do not have to  take  from  those  of  whom  were  frugal,  made  sure  that  they  paid  their way, and are now dead.\u2019\u2019 This  tax  hits  the  small  business owner  and  the  family  farmer  the  hardest.  These  are  the  individuals  who  sacrifice, who invest their time and money in  the  family  business  and  their  farm, and they want to  leave this world comforted  with  the  knowledge  that  their children  and  grandchildren  can  also continue their labor and hard work. The  death  tax  collects  for  the  Federal  Government  merely  1  percent  of the  revenues.  Do my  colleagues  realize that  if  we  cleaned  up  the  fraud  on  the earned  income  tax  credit  we  could more than offset this tax? Yet  compliance  costs  are  nearly  as much  as the  revenue  collected.  And  the  time  a  small business  owner  or  farmer  spends  to  plan  for the  inevitable  coming  of  death,  is  time  and  energy  and  money  that  is  not  spent  on  growing the  business.  A  dollar  that  goes  to  the  accountant  or  lawyer  is  a  dollar  that  does  not  go to new equipment or expansion. rule  and  support Mr. for the  gov. . Hard a  tax  on  the  very  behavior  should  be  encouraging . This  is  ernment  Work. Only  one-third  of  family-owned  businesses survive  into  the  next  generation.  All  too  often a  family  business  or  farm  has  to  be  liquidated so  the  heirs  can  pay  the  death  tax.  When  a family  has  to  sell  the  family  farm  to  pay  taxes, it  can  mean  that  open  space,  fields  and  forests,  are  lost  to  development.  There  is  an  indirect  adverse  impact  to  our  environment  from this  tax. The  death  tax  is  unnecessary,  unfair  and against  the  virtue  of  hard  work.  It  is  wrong  to confiscate  the  savings  of  people  who  work hard all  their  lives. I  urge  the  adoption  of  the  the  repeal of  the death  tax. Mr.  MOAKLEY.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield 2  minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Mississippi (Mr. TAYLOR). Mr.  TAYLOR  of  Mississippi.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  gentleman  yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, I hope during the course of  this  debate  someone  will  explain  to me how a Nation  that  is  $5.7  trillion  in debt; a Nation that squanders $1 billion a  day  in  interest  on  that  debt;  a  Congress  that  during  their  lifetimes  saw the debt rise by $4.7 trillion; a Congress that  is  delaying  the  pay  of  the  troops in  the  military  from  September  29  to October  1  in  a  budget  game  to  move that $2.5 billion expense to the next fiscal  year,  no  big  deal  for  a  Congressman,  big  deal  for  an  E2  or  an  E3  when they  do  not  have  money  for  diapers  or formula  that weekend;  a  Congress  that will  not  vote  on  the  Shows  bill  to  help our  Nation\u2019s  veterans  and  military  retirees  because  they  say we  do  not  have the $5 billion, but this same Congress is now  saying  we  are  going  to  ignore  the fact  that  we  owe  the  Social  Security Trust Fund $800 billion, we are going to ignore  the  $1  billion  a  day  we  are  paying in interest on that debt, and we are going  to  give  the  wealthiest  two  percent of all Americans a tax break. If  they  earn  $650,000,  they  pay  taxes on  it.  But  they  can  inherit  $650,000  and pay  nothing.  That  is  the  present  law. So  we  are  really  talking  about  things above  that.  And  if  it  happens  to  be  a couple, then it is $1.3 million. Yes,  there  are  some  farmers  who  are the  unfortunate  victims  of  the  inflation  value  of  their  acreage.  Yes,  there are  some small business owners. Let us gear  this  bill  to  take  care  of  them  instead of helping the  folks who have the most,  who,  in  all  probability,  benefit when  we  borrow  money  because  they sell us the T bills, and they are already getting  the  interest  on  that  debt  and all  we  are  going  to  do  is  pass  this  generation\u2019s bills on to our children. I  will  not  do  that  as  an  individual.  will not do that as a Congressman. Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11\u20442 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. GILMAN).

            "47": "June 8, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:69) H4089 a and  TIAHRT)  there  is  a  way  to  do  something  way not to do something. This  chart  shows,  as  the  gentleman indicated,  that  just  36  days  ago  this House  promised  that  it  was  going  to spend  $7  billion  on  special  education. This  bill  contains  $5.5  billion  for  special  education. We  were  trying  to  offer an  amendment  to  add  $1.5  billion  to special  education,  not  by  cutting  all  of the  programs  that  the  gentleman  from Illinois  has  just  listed  but  by  changing this equation. We  wanted  the  majority  party  to take  20  percent  of  the  tax  cuts  which they  are  voting  through  this  place  this year,  eliminate  20  percent  of  those  tax cuts  so  that  we  could  fully  fund  not only education  for the handicapped but so  that  we  could  fully  fund  other  education  and  health  and  worker  training programs.  We  could  have  funded  all  of those  amendments  by  simply  scaling back  the  size  of  the  tax  cut  by  20  percent.  And  before  anybody  has  a  heart attack,  73  percent  of  the  benefits  from those  tax  cuts  are  scheduled  to  go  to the  richest  1  percent  of  people  in  the country.  The  other  99  out  of  100  are only scheduled to get 27 percent. Now,  that  is  a  better  way  to  finance this  amendment  than  the way  that  the gentleman  is  proposing.  A  couple  of hours  ago,  when  the  gentleman  from Kansas  (Mr.  was  on  the  floor, he  presented  the  House  with  a  chart and  he  was  bragging  about  how  much the  majority  party  has  increased  funding  for  the  Job  Corps.  And  I  stood  up and  I  said,  hooray,  Allah  be  praised, hallelujah,  everything  else  I  could think  of,  welcome  to  the  club,  because I  remember  fighting  on  this  floor  in 1981 when Ronald Reagan was trying to zero  out  the  Job  Corps.  So  I  welcomed the gentleman and I welcomed the conversion  of  the  majority  party  to  support  for  Job  Corps.  This  amendment,  3 hours  later, would cut Job Corps by $42 million. Job  Corps  has  only  a  50  percent  success  rate,  but  we  are  starting  out  in Job Corps with kids who have been  losers 100 percent of the time. So a 50 percent  rate  of  saving  kids  who  otherwise are  on  a  short  route  to  nowhere  is  a whole  lot  better  batting  average  than Babe Ruth ever had. But  this  would  cut  Job  Corps.  It would cut nurses training. It would cut community  health  funding.  That  is where  poor  people  go  to  get  their health  care  because  they  often  cannot go  to  a  normal  middle-class  hospital and  get  that  health  care  without  begging.  It  would  cut  that  back.  It  would cut  back  the  abstinence  aid  that  the gentleman  from  Oklahoma  is  so  interested  in.  It  would  cut  back  public health  funding  in  the  Center  for  Disease Control. It would cut back funding to  fight  drug  abuse.  It  would  cut  back Impact  Aid.  It  would  make  a  $450  million cut in the class size block grant. The  majority  has  asked  us  on  this side  of  the  aisle  why  we  do  not  block grant  this  money  instead  of  requiring that  money  be  spent  to  reduce  class OBEY OBEY) Mr.  additional sizes?  And  we  have  said  because  we have  seen what happens when we block grant  money.  First,  we  block  grant  it, and  then  after  it  is  put  in  one  block, then  it  is  cut;  and  you  can  escape  the political  attention  that  comes  from having  to  cut  the  programs  individually  because  they  are  all  in  one  lump. The  CHAIRMAN.  The  time  of  the gentleman  from  Wisconsin  (Mr.  has expired. (By  unanimous  consent,  was  allowed  to  proceed  for  2  minutes.) Mr. OBEY. So we have evidence right here in this amendment, Mr. Chairman, to  verify  our  fears. We  do  not  even  yet have  the  block  grant  put  into  law  and already  this  amendment  is  trying  to cut it by $450 million. Then  it  cuts  Indian  education.  It even  cuts  $3  million  out  of  Gallaudet, the  school  for  the  blind.  And  there  are some other cuts. So,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  point  out that  even  the  people who  are  the  beneficiaries  of  this  amendment  are  asking that  it  not  be  passed.  The  Council  for Exceptional Children, that  is the group that lobbies for funding for special education  is  saying,  \u2018\u2018Do  we  want  the money?  Yes.  But  do  we  want  it  at  the expense  of  cutting  these  other  educational  programs?  No,  we  do  not.\u2019\u2019 PTA  is  saying  the  same  thing.  Our local  school  administrators  are  saying the same thing. I  do  not  blame  the  gentleman  for  offering  this  amendment,  because  he  has a  legitimate  heartfelt  concern.  But what  this  amendment  demonstrates  is what  we  have  been  trying  to  say  all year  on  this  side  of  the  aisle.  It  demonstrates  there  is  simply  not  enough funding  in  this  bill  for  education  of  all kinds  and  for  health  care  and  for  job training.  Sooner  or  later  the  majority will  recognize  that.  Sooner  or  later  it is  going  to  have  to  change  this  equation  so  that  we  get  a  better  deal  for middle-class  taxpayers;  and,  at  the same  time,  sooner  or  later  we  will  put back  not  only  the  money  for  special education but  the additional money we need  for  Pell  Grants,  for  Title  I,  and the list goes on and on. It,  unfortunately,  is  going  to  take longer  than  it  ought.  But,  meanwhile, we  should  not  complicate  it  by  passing this  amendment.  So  I  regretfully  urge its rejection. Mr.  CUNNINGHAM.  Mr.  Chairman,  I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of words. Mr.  GOODLING.  Mr.  the gentleman yield? Mr.  CUNNINGHAM.  I  yield  gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr.  GOODLING.  Mr.  Chairman,  I thank  the  gentleman  for  yielding  to me. I  just  want  to  talk  a  little  bit  about broken  promises.  It  was  not  Republicans in 1975 that said to the American people  that  we  will  move  this  legislation  and  within  a  few  years  we  will give 40 percent of excess costs. We were not in the majority. Chairman,  will to  the During  that  entire  time,  while  that majority  was  here,  we  never  got  anywhere  near  the  40  percent.  We  never got above 6 percent. At least in the last 5 years we have gotten up to 13 percent. So do not tell me about broken promises.  They  were  made  from  the  other side  of  the  aisle  and  they  were  made back  in  1975,  and  nothing  was  done when they had a 2-to-1 majority  in this Congress of the United States. 1800 Mr.  CUNNINGHAM.  Mr.  Chairman, reclaiming my  time,  I  sympathize with the  gentleman  that  is  offering  the amendment.  I  was  chairman  of  the Subcommittee  on  Authorization  when this  bill  came  through  for  the  first time  on  IDEA.  If  my  colleagues  have ever  had  a  tangle  where  they  put  parent  groups  and  school  groups  together, it  is  like  putting  a  Persian  and  a  Siamese cat  together.  It  is a very difficult and it is a very complicated bill. I  rise  in  opposition  to  the  amendment  of  the  gentleman.  And  I  was  the IDEA  man  of  the  year  that  year  for pushing  the  bill  through.  And  then later we had a colleague take over that position  when  I  came  to  Appropriations. But  if  the  gentlemen  on  both  sides really  want  to  help,  and  I  think  they do  legitimately,  Alan  Bersin  is  the  superintendent  of  San  Diego  City Schools. He was the appointee of President  Clinton  on  the  border.  He  did  a pretty  good  job,  and  now  he  is  a  superintendent.  His  number  one  problem  is IDEA in the schools. Why?  Not  so  much  the  funding,  but we  are  losing  good  teachers  that  want to  help  special-needs  children.  They are  being  forced  into  the  courts  by  liberal trial lawyers that form cottage organizations  and  go  to  these  parent groups  and  demand  super  Cadillac  systems when  they may  only  qualify  for  a small portion. We have  a  school  in San Diego where it  costs  $200,000  a  year  for  one  child  in special education. And the schools cannot  afford  that.  Quite  often,  as  we  increase  the  money,  the  trial  lawyers come in and steal that money. I  agree  with  the  gentleman,  special education  does  need  more  money.  I would  like to work with the gentleman on  that.  But  some  of  these  programs, for  example  Impact  Aid,  do  my  colleagues  know  how  negatively  that  affects  military  families  and  Native American  families?  It  really  impacts them  negatively.  And  so,  I  would  say to the gentleman, I agree with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY) that these  are  programs  some  of  us  feel  are very,  very  important,  Impact  Aid, Galludet  University.  Republicans  and Democrats  play  in  a  basketball  game there  every  year  just  to  raise  a  little bit of money. Howard  University.  I  went  out  and visited  the  president.  When  we  talk about minority education, look and see the  job  they are doing.

That is the problem with onesize-fits-all  rules.  They  are  written  for dance  studios,  bakeries,  restaurants, and  farms  and  ranches. We  cannot  possibly  apply  a  single  rule  like  that, where  everyone  can  fit  in  a  particular category  and  say,  yes,  we  are  in  compliance. The  director  of  OSHA  said,  do  not worry,  we  will  let  the  employers  know when  they  are  in  compliance,  which means  that  this  will  give  the  Federal bureaucracy  at  OSHA  a  tremendous latitude  in  determining  when  employers are in compliance. This  has  the  ability,  Mr.  Chairman, all  across  the  board  in America,  again, whether it is an auto parts store, a customs  broker  office,  a  doctors  office,  a restaurant,  a  small  manufacturing company,  the  cost  of  mailing  a  letter, all  of  this  is  going  to  increase,  could increase  greatly  in  cost  for  consumers out  there  if  this  rule  is  implemented the way it has been written. I would just strongly encourage all of my  colleagues  to  look  at  whose  side they  are  on  on  this  issue.  There  is  no gray. They are either on the side of the salt  of  the Earth  economic  engine  that drives  this  country,  the  small  business sector,  or  they  are  on  the  side  of  the power  hungry  union  leaders  who  are trying to implement this.

NORTHUP),  NORTHUP),  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  in  strong  support  of  this  amendment,  which  would safeguard  America\u2019s  working  women and  America\u2019s  working  family.  That  is whose side we are on in this debate. Mr. Chairman, this is a $60 billion national  problem  that  affects  650,000 workers  each  year.  Ergonomic  health disorders  afflict  female  occupations, including  nursing  aides,  orderlies,  attendants,  registered  nurses,  cashiers, and maids. Women  suffer  disproportionately. While  ergonomic  hazards  produce  34 percent  of  all  workplace  injuries  and illnesses,  they  cause  nearly  one-half  of these  among  women.  Although  women comprise  46  percent  of  the  work  force and  33  percent  of  the  injured  workers, women  represent  63  percent  of  repetitive  motion  syndrome,  including  69 percent  of  lost  work  time  cases  resulting from carpal tunnel syndrome. Congress\u2019  fight  to  protect  workers\u2019 health  and  safety  has  been  a  long  one. In  1996,  I  had  an  amendment  on  the floor  which  we  won  in  a  Republican Congress,  which  we  won  almost  unanimous  support  from  the  Democratic side,  a  few  votes  on  the  Republican side. What  this  language  in  the  legislation before us does, this is an obstruction to the  implementation  of  that  1996 amendment.  What  the  amendment  of the  gentlemen  from  Pennsylvania,  Mr. Weldon  and  Mr.  Traficant,  would  do  is to strike that language. This  is  very  constructive.  I  hope  our colleagues will support the Department of Labor\u2019s ergonomic standards and oppose  all  delaying  amendments,  including  the  language  in  this  bill,  and  support Weldon-Traficant. Mr. Chairman, the scientific evidence supports  OSHA\u2019s  standard.  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  the  National Institute of Occupational Health and  Safety,  the  American  Public Health  Association,  and  many  other scientific  and  public  health  organizations  have  already  concluded  that workplace  risk  factors  contribute  to health  problems,  and  ergonomics  programs  reduce  this  risk.  That  is  whose side  we  are  on,  the  National  Academy of Sciences. 1900 The  National  Academy  of  Sciences 1998  study  on  ergonomics  reported  that risk  factors  at  work  cause  musculoskeletal  disorders  and  these  are  preventable. The National  Institute  of Occupational  Safety  and  Health  1997  peer review  analysis  of  more  than  600  prior reported  reliable  evidence  that  job-related  heavy  physical  work  contributes to workplace injuries and illnesses. Employer  ergonomic  programs  are effective.  Many  very  responsible  businesses,  large,  medium,  and  small,  in this  country  have  decreased  their  recordable  cases  in worker  compensation costs  because  they  have  invested  in ergonomic  programs  and  they  have  recouped  the costs of  implementing their program.  This  evidence  is  available from  companies  as  diverse  as  Minnesota-based  3M  with  nearly  40,000  employees, to North Carolina\u2019s Charleston Forge with only 150 workers. OSHA\u2019s  ergonomic  standard  is  sensible,  limited  in  scope,  and  based  on success. Prior Congresses have voted in support  of  it.  In  1996,  as  I  mentioned, 1997,  and  1998  Congress  specifically agreed  not  to  delay  OSHA  from  finalizing  an  ergonomic  standard.  This  language  in  the  bill  before us  today would violate these standards. And  as  I  said  earlier,  women  are  disproportionately  affected  by  ergonomic injuries,  and  I  talked  about  their  percentage  in  the  workforce,  and  the  disproportionate  impact  on  women  and days lost. I  do  want  to  say,  because  the  question  was  asked  whose  side  are  we  on. We  are  on  the  side  of  America\u2019s  working  families.  We  are  on  the  side  of  the National  Academy  of  Sciences.  We  are on  the  sides  of  responsible  business large,  small,  and  moderate-size  businesses  in  our  counties  who  have  taken the initiative. I stand here with the American Association  of  Occupational  Health  Nurses, the  American  College  of  Occupational and  Environmental Medicine,  the  prior GOP  Labor  Secretaries,  in  support  of OSHA\u2019s  effort  to  finalize  its  ergonomic standard. Nearly  20  years  ago,  in  April,  1979, OSHA  hired  its  first  ergonomist.  Nearly  a  decade  ago,  in  1990,  Labor  Secretary Elizabeth Dole said, by reducing repetitive  motion  injuries,  we  will  increase  both  the  safety  and  the  productivity of America\u2019s workforce. Secretary Dole  said,  I have no higher priority  than  accomplishing  just  that. And so 10 years ago, Elizabeth Dole was right.  Let  us  not  wait  another  day  to protect  America\u2019s  working  women, America\u2019s working families. Mr. Chairman, I urge a  \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 vote on this amendment. Mr.  GOODLING.  Mr.  Chairman,  I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of words,  and  I  rise  in  strong  opposition to  the  amendment  offered  by  my  colleague,  the  gentleman  from  Ohio  (Mr. which  will  allow  OSHA  to rush  forward  with  its  flawed ergonomics rulemaking. I strongly support  the  provision  in  the  underlying bill  sponsored  by  my  colleague,  the gentlewoman  from  Kentucky  (Mrs. prohibiting  OSHA  from  finalizing  its  risky  ergonomics  rule which is not based on good science. For  more  than  2  years,  the  Committee on Education and the Workforce has  expressed  concerns  to  OSHA  about the  lack  of  a  scientific  basis  for  an ergonomic  standard  through  hearings and  through  letters  to  the  Department of Labor. Last  year,  the  House  approved  the bill, which would require OSHA to wait for  the  results  of  the  congressionally funded  National  Academy  of  Sciences study  and  ergonomics,  a million  dollar study  I  might  mention.

Many of the things the Republicans have in the bill are not going to be in this final bill. There will be  precedents  set  in  this  bill  and  there should  be  an  opportunity  to  carve  out opportunity  in  this  bill.  This  amendment  is  the  exact  amendment  that  I passed  to  H.R.  3846,  March  9  of  this year.  It  passed  246\u2013179.  What  is  the shell  game?  Is  it  tied  up  in  politics with  the  tax  cut  and  now  it  is  tied  up with  legislating  on  an  appropriations bill? The  Traficant  amendment  simply says  there  shall  be  an  increase  in  the minimum  wage,  $1  over  2  years.  The original  language  was  $1  over  3  years. The  House  has  already  spoken  its  will on this. It has not been signed into law, and it is being tied up with the tax cut. But  it  should  not  be  tied  up  in  a measure like this. I want to compliment the gentleman. He  is  one  of  the  first  chairmen  to  bring  a  bill  out  because  these bills  are  folded  into  continuing  resolutions  because  both  parties  are  playing politics with it and it is an election. I  want  a  minimum  wage  increase. Tell  me  how  else  we  can  get  it,  and  I would  be  glad  to  support  it.  But  if  the labor  appropriations  bill  is  not  the place  for  a  minimum  wage  increase, God  save  America.  Let  me  say  this. The  appropriators  should  have  done this.  The  appropriators  should  have done this. I am disappointed the Democrat  Party  did  not  bang  away  on  this issue.  I  guess  they  are  more  concerned about  the  AFL\u2013CIO  and  election-year politics.  Quite  frankly,  battle  it  out, folks.  But  I  think  the  $1  over  2  years that  passed  overwhelmingly  in  this body with  bipartisan  support  should  be included  in  this  bill.  It  would  take  a hell  of  a  lot  of  politics  out  of  it  and  it would  make  that  White  House  take  a good  look at  it and  it would make  that conference  with  the  gentleman  from Florida (Mr. YOUNG) very exciting. I  think  that  is  what  Congress  should do.  I  do  understand  it  is  legislating  on an  appropriations  bill,  but  that  has been  going  on  around  here  for  years, and  I  do  ask  for  that  exception  and give  the  Congress  an  opportunity  to vote  on  it.  Otherwise,  we  just  masquerade  for  party  sakes,  of  proffering legislation  designed  to  win  majorities. I  think  it  is  time  to  win  America,  and I  think  it  is  time  to  do  what  is  right for workers. I will say this. This rising tide that is raising  all  ships  has  left  a  lot  of  little people  behind.  I  know  this  bill  ultimately  is  going  to  be  folded  into  some legislation,  and  I  would  hope  that  the chairman would reconsider his position and  that  the  chairman  would  defer  to the  vote  of  the  authorizing mechanism of  this  Congress  who  duly  passed  this amendment. I  say  to  committee,  thing.  I  see  both  sides.  I  2015 the  chairman  of  the  subhe  should  do  the  right politics  being  played  on see  election  year  politics over  here,  election  year  politics  over there. To  be  quite  honest,  I  think  I  see more  over  here.  But  there  are  parts  of this bill we cannot support. But I think if  there are parts of  this bill we cannot support,  that  sends  it  to  conference, and  maybe  we  can  come  out  with  a compromise  that  we  can  all  live  with, including  the  White  House.  I  thought that  was  the  reason  for  bringing  this bill out, is a dead-bang veto in the first place. So  having  stated  that,  I  would  hope that the chairman would reconsider his position,  vote  with  me  and  allow  the gentleman  from  Connecticut  (Mr. to  stand  up  in  support  of  it  as SHAYS)  well. With  that,  I  would  request  of  the Chair that if there is an objection, that I  be  permitted  the  opportunity  to  contest that objection. POINT OF ORDER wish Mr.  PORTER.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  make a  point  of  order  against  the  amendment  because  it  proposes  to  change  existing  law  and  constitutes  legislation in  an  appropriations  bill,  and  therefore violates clause 2 of rule XXI. The  rule  states  in  pertinent  part:  an amendment  to  a  general  appropriation bill  shall  not  be  in  order  if  it  changes existing  law.  The  amendment  directly amends existing law. I ask for a ruling from the Chair. The  CHAIRMAN.  The  gentleman makes  a  point  of  order  against  the Traficant amendment. Does  the  gentleman  from  Ohio  to be heard on the point of order? Mr. TRAFICANT. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I  do.  I  believe  the  gentleman\u2019s  argument  is  in  order,  save  for  the  possible precedents  of  an  unusual  situation. Although  it  is  not  existing  law,  the  authorizing  committee  of  this  body  being the  body  of  the  full House,  has  already voted  on  the  issue  and  spoken  on  the issue. That should make  it  subject  to a parliamentary  ruling  that  is  quite  different  from  an  individual  bringing  out of  the  blue  a  minimum-wage  increase with no prior authorizing foundation. Mr.  Chairman,  we  do  not  here  make decisions  for  the  other  body.  We  can only  make  those  decisions  for  ourselves.  We  have  already  made  that  decision.  The  House  has  technically  authorized,  if  you will,  and  placed  in motion  the  authorization  of  a  minimumwage  increase.  I  do  not  believe  we  are striking  new  territory,  and  if  such  a precedent  is  needed,  then  maybe  a precedent should be voted on. Now,  I  do  not  want  to  challenge  the ruling  of  the  Chair,  and  I  fully  respect the  ruling  of  the  Chair;  but  I  want  a minimum  wage  increase  in  this  bill, and I am going to give  it that shot. My final  argument  is  this: when  the House votes  and  authorizes,  is  it  not  a  fact that  one  cannot  have  anything  other than  that  authorization  by  law  in  an appropriation bill? So by law, if the appropriators  put  the  Traficant  language passed  in H.R.  3846  in  this  bill,  it  could not  have  been  stricken.  So  the  appropriators  now  made  a  decision,  relative The  is  preby  the  Chair  TRAFICANT)  to  the  full  House,  and  I  do  not  believe the  appropriators  should  have  control over  the  decisions  of  the  full  House. Thus,  I  believe,  that  precedent  should be set, and the parliamentarians should rule,  because  the  House  has  already spoken  and  a Member  is  attempting  to put  the  authorization  language  of  the House,  the  full  House,  into  the  appropriation bill. The authorization bill has not  been  passed  by  the  other  body;  the appropriation  bill  has  not  been  passed by  the  other  body.  Thus  this  bill  is wide open for this amendment. Now,  before  the  Chairman  reads  the bad news, I want to say this again. The other  body  has  not  voted  on  the  authorizing  package;  but  the  other  body has  not  voted  nor,  in  fact,  assembled over  this  appropriation  bill.  Since there  is  no  objection  from  the  other body,  and  this  full  House  has  authorized that provision, that should make a precedent and allow it to be included as an  amendment  to  be  offered  on  the floor,  and  it  should  not  be  prohibited from being heard in this appropriations cycle. The  CHAIRMAN.  pared to rule. The  amendment  offered  gentleman  from  Ohio  (Mr.  directly  amends  existing  law.  The amendment,  therefore,  constitutes  legislation  in  violation  of  clause  2  of  rule XXI.  The  point  of  order  is  sustained, and the amendment is not in order. Mr.  TRAFICANT.  Mr.  Chairman,  I move  to appeal  the  ruling of  the Chair. The  CHAIRMAN.  The  question  is, shall  the decision of  the Chair  stand as the judgment of the Committee. The  question  was  taken;  and  Chairman  announced  that  the  ayes  peared to have it. Mr. TRAFICANT. On that, Mr. Chairman,  I  demand  a  recorded  vote;  and pending  that,  I  make  a  point  of  order that a quorum is not present. Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the  vote  be  held  over  until tomorrow,  if  it  poses  a  hardship  on Members. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I object. The  CHAIRMAN.  That  unanimous consent  is  not  in  order  in  the  Committee of the Whole. Mr.  TRAFICANT.  Mr.  Chairman,  I ask  unanimous  consent  to  withdraw my appeal tonight and to be allowed to appeal  the  Chair  tomorrow  on  the issue. The  CHAIRMAN.  That  unanimous consent  is  not  in  order. The  gentleman could  offer  his  amendment  again  when the  Committee  resumes  its  sitting  if that  is  his  choice,  perhaps  at  a  different place in the bill. Mr.  TRAFICANT.  Mr.  Chairman,  I ask  unanimous  consent  that  I  be  allowed  to  offer  my  amendment  tomorrow  and  that  it  be  limited  to  a  total  of 10  minutes  debate,  5  minutes  divided, by  both  parties,  an  opponent,  and  myself as the proponent. The  CHAIRMAN.  When  the  Committee  of  the  Whole  resumes  its  sitting,  the  gentleman  could  reoffer  his amendment. the apVerDate 01-JUN-2000 04:59 Jun 09, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K08JN7.180 pfrm09 PsN: H08PT1 \f ",
            "71": "June 8, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:69) H4113 us  say  if  you  have  a  400-acre  farm  and let us say for the purposes of this hypothetical,  $1500  per  acre,  some  places  in Missouri  that  would  be  low,  some places  in  Missouri  perhaps  high  but  I think  on  average  if  you  say  $1500  per acre  average,  for  a  400-acre  farm,  right there  you  are  talking  about  a  $600,000 value  just  on  land,  not  mentioning equipment  that  is  needed  to  produce, not  talking  about  the  residence  or  the home. My  friend  from  Colorado  mentioned his  constituent,  having  grown  up  and being  born  and  grown  up  in  the  residence and worrying about being able to hang  on  to  that  asset.  Life  insurance proceeds,  all  of  this  becoming  part  of the  estate  that  now  is  subject  to  the tax.  Once  that  estate  value  is  $1  more than the exemption, you are looking at about  a  37  percent  tax  rate  up  to,  as the  gentleman  says,  over  half,  55  percent  and  in  some  instances  as  high  as 60 percent. The  point  I  would  like  to  make  is this,  and  I  hope  tomorrow  as  we  have this  debate,  I  really  would  encourage or  challenge  anybody  who  opposes  this to give me a good policy reason why we have an inheritance tax. Really what is the  reason?  Two  weeks  ago  in  this House  we  repealed  the  Spanish  American  War  tax  that  was  imposed  102 years  ago  in  1898,  that,  quote,  temporary  tax  to  fund  the  Spanish  American  War  which  now  we  finally  repealed,  the  inheritance  tax  as we know it  today,  1916  and  really  what  is  the policy  reason?  What  is  the  justification?  I  can  really  only  think  of  two. One  is  to  punish  the  successful,  which I  do  not  think  even  our  liberal  friends would  necessarily  agree with  that.  The only  other  instance  I  can  think  of  as far  as  justification  for  keeping  the  inheritance  tax  is  redistribution  of wealth.  I  think  certainly  under  our present  tax  code  and  the  progressive nature,  there are many  far better ways and  certainly  when  we  are  talking about  to,  quote,  raise  revenue  for  the government,  rather  than  this  very  unfair  tax  which  I  think  punishes  family farms,  family  businesses  of  whatever size, whether they are facing the tax or whether  they  are  expending  resources to  avoid  the  tax  along  the  course  of one\u2019s  lifetime,  I  think  that  tomorrow afternoon  we  will  be  gratified  with  a vote.  I  would  hope  and  I  know  our friends  down  on  the  other  end  of Pennsylvania  Avenue  have  issued  some  sort of  a  veto  threat  under  the  present  bill, I  would  like  to  see  as  we  get  that  vote tallied  tomorrow,  a  two-thirds  vote  in this  House.  It  is  a  bipartisan  bill  with 45  Democratic  cosponsors,  many  Republicans, and  so  I urge my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to vote in favor of this repeal, to do what  is right, because again the  death  of  a  family  member  should not be a taxable event. Mr.  MCINNIS.  I  would  acknowledge to  my  friend  the  45  Democrats  that have  signed  onto  this,  they  have enough  guts  to  stand  up  to  the  administration  and  stand  up  and  say  wait  a minute  to  their  colleagues  on  the Democratic  side,  let  us  talk  about,  is this  tax  justified.  Sure  the  revenue might  be  important  but  the  primary focus  of  our  question  here  this  evening and the primary focus of our debate tomorrow  should  be,  is  this  tax  upon one\u2019s  death  a  fair  and  justified  tax? You  can  only  answer  that  honestly  by saying no. As  the  gentleman  just  very  accurately pointed out,  there are  three  reasons that this tax came about. One was an  animosity  and  a  jealousy  towards the Rockefellers  and  the Carnegies  and those  kinds  of  families.  It  was  a  transfer of wealth. Even Al Hunt  in his article  today  in  the  Wall  Street  Journal says  the  tax  has  always  been  aimed  at the  accumulation  of  wealth  by  sons and  daughters  of  the  elite.  So  because your  parent  as  in  my  case  in  small town  Colorado,  because  their  parents realized  the  American  dream,  because they  had  a  company  that  employed people  in  that  community,  they  should be penalized. The  second  reason  that  these  aristocrats and I call these the aristocrats, they  may  not  have  been  aristocrats  in wealth  but  they  were  aristocrats  in class  warfare.  That  is  the  second  reason.  Hey,  let\u2019s  go  after  the  rich.  The rich  are  always  the  wrong  people.  If you  are  rich  somehow  in  this  country, they  never  figure  out  and  the  same with  the  administration,  they  never figure  out  maybe  you  worked  for  it, maybe  the  American  dream  allowed you  to  have  it.  And  what  does  \u2018\u2018rich\u2019\u2019 mean?  In  a  lot  of  our  towns  in  Colorado, owning  50 acres  is  something.  If  I had 50 acres, I would feel rich. The government  looks  at  it  as  an  opportunity to tax you. I think it is very important that as we look into tomorrow\u2019s debate that we  look  at  real  life  examples  that somehow  my  colleagues  on  the  Democratic  side  of  the  aisle  who  are  opposing  any  kind  of  reduction  or  oppose elimination of  the death  tax,  that  they first  go  out  into  their  community  and do  not  go  out  to  the  Kennedys  or  the Gates  or  the  wealthy  people,  go  out  to the  average  person  in  your  community who  has  had  some  success,  who  has  a home  or  some  property  valued  over that  $675,000  and  ask  them  what  happens  to  their  money  upon  their  death. What  I  urge  my  Democrat  colleagues and  what  I  ask  the  administration  to take  a  look  at  on  their  policy  is  remember  that  what  you  are  doing,  you are  removing  money  from  a  community  and  you  are  transferring  it  to Washington, D.C. Let me tell you what we have experienced  in  the  State  of  Colorado.  Fortunately  a  lot  of  you  visit  Colorado,  and I am happy you do. Unfortunately a lot of  people  decided  to  stay  there,  it  is  so beautiful.  And  so  our  land  values  have gone  up  in  Colorado.  What  we  are  seeing in Colorado is a lot of our beautiful open  space,  our  mountains  are  being converted to subdivisions. Those mountains  and  those  fields  and  those  farms, they are farms and ranches. The reason that  that  land  is  available  is  not  because  these  families  want  to  give  up farming,  not  because  these  families want  to  give  up  ranching,  not  because they  want  to  give  up  the  rural  way  of life but because in many cases the Federal Government  through  its  death  tax forces  the  family  to  sell  that  land.  If you  want  to  help  protect  open  space, let these farms and ranches continue in existence  and  do  not  let  the  Al  Hunts of  this world  tell  you, well,  they  ought to  just  go  out  and  plan  for  it,  or  the Gates  family  we  are  talking  about  or the  Forbes  family  we  are  talking about,  or  the  Carnegies  or  the  Rockefellers.  Do  not  let  them  sell  you  on that. They are  sugar-coating  it. Do not let them sugar-coat what you are doing by  this  death  tax.  It  is  not  right,  it  is not  fair,  and  you  ought  to  admit  it  is not  right  and  it  is  not  fair.  And  you ought  to  get  a  firsthand  experience from  your  own  constituents  as  to what it does to your community. And the example  I  gave  you  this  evening,  what  it did  to  the  local  church.  The  ranch  example,  what  I  gave  you  this  evening and  what  it  does  to  open  space  in States  like  Colorado,  what  it  does  to little  businesses  like  Brookhart  Lumber  Company  in Delta,  Colorado. Headline  in  our  local  newspaper  about  4 months  ago,  Brookhart  must  sell  because  of  estate  taxes.  Brookhart,  by the way, is not Home Depot. Brookhart maybe  had  20  or  30  employees.  Those people\u2019s  jobs  were  at  risk.  I  do  not know whether they had to sell it or liquidate  it.  In a  lot of cases they have to liquidate  it.  Remember  that  the  only time  that  money  does  not  work  in  a community,  the  only  time  you  do  not see  the  wealth,  somebody\u2019s  wealth  circulate  in  a  community  is  if  a  wealthy person  goes  out  and  digs  a  hole  and buries their money  in the ground. That does not happen very often. People who accumulate  through  success  money  in a  community  put  it  in  the  bank,  they hire  more  people,  they  make  investments,  they  buy  land,  that  money  circulates  and  circulates  and  circulates. And  all  the  death  tax  does  is  it  goes  in and  forces  that  money,  one,  to  be  converted to a cash form which requires in a  lot  of  cases  forced  sales;  two,  it  requires  double  or  triple  taxation;  and, three,  and  probably  as  critical  as  anything  else,  it  sucks  that  money  out  of the  small  community  or  out  of  any community and transfers the money to the  Federal  Government  in  Washington,  D.C.  for  redistribution.  By  the way,  a  lot  of  that  money  is  redistributed  in  the  confines  of  Washington, D.C. So this community benefited upon the  death  of  my  constituents  out  in rural Colorado. Where is the fairness of that?  Where  is  the  fairness  of  a  family in  rural  Missouri  having  their  family accumulation  under  the  American dream  sucked  to  Washington,  D.C.? That  saying,  the  giant  sucking  sound of  NAFTA  many  years  ago,  that  is  exactly what the estate tax does.

            "87": "June 8, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) S4727 So  continued  cooperation  with  Russia  on  these  arms  control  programs  is critical.  Furthermore,  no  matter  how transparent  we  are  with  Russia  about the  intent  and  capabilities  of  the  proposed  system, Russia\u2019s military  leadership  will  interpret  a  unilateral  deployment  as  a  direct  threat  to  their  deterrence  capacity.  And  while  Russia doesn\u2019t  have  the  economic  strength today to significantly enhance its military capabilities,  there are clear examples  of  Russia\u2019s  capacity  to  wield  formidable military  power  when  it  wants. We  must  not  allow  a  unilateral  NMD deployment  to  provoke  the  Russian people  into  setting  aside  the  difficult but necessary  tasks of democratization and economic reform in a vain effort to return  to  Russia\u2019s  days  of  military glory. Finally, with regard to Russia, a unilateral  deployment  by  the  United States  would  jeopardize  our  cooperation  on  a  whole  range  of  significant issues.  However  imperfect  it  is,  U.S.Russian  cooperation  will  continue  to be  important on matters  from stopping Teheran\u2019s proliferation efforts and containing  Iraq\u2019s  weapons  programs  to promoting stability in the Balkans. While  the  impact  of  a  limited  U.S. system  on  Russian  security  considerations  would  be  largely  perceptual,  at least  as  long  as  that  system  remains limited, its impact on China\u2019s strategic posture  is  real  and  immediate.  China today  has  roughly  20-plus  long-range missiles.  The  proposed  system  would undermine  China\u2019s  strategic  deterrent as surely as it would contain the threat from  North  Korea.  And  that  poses  a problem  because,  unlike  North  Korea, China  has  the  financial  resources  to build a much larger arsenal. The  Pentagon  believes  it  is  likely that  China  will  increase  the  number and  sophistication  of  its  long-range missiles  just as part of  its overall military modernization effort, regardless of what  we  do  on  NMD.  But  as  with  Russia,  if  an  NMD  decision  is  made  without  consultation  with  China,  the  leadership  in  Beijing  will  perceive  the  deployment  as  at  least  partially  directed at them. And given the recent strain in U.S.-China  relations  and  uncertainty in the Taiwan Strait, the vital U.S. national interest in maintaining stability in the Pacific would, in fact, be greatly undermined  by  such  a  decision  made too rashly. Nobody understands the destabilizing effect  of  a  unilateral  U.S.  NMD  decision  better  than  our  allies  in  Europe and  in  the  Pacific.  The  steps  that Russia  and  China  would  take  to  address their  insecurities  about  the  U.S.  system  will  make  their  neighbors  less  secure.  And  a  new  environment  of  competition  and  distrust  will  undermine regional stability by impeding cooperation  on  proliferation,  drug  trafficking, humanitarian  crises,  and  all  the  other transnational  problems  we  are  confronting  together.  So  I  think  it  is  critical  that  we  find  a  way  to  deploy  an NMD  without  sending  even  a  hint  of  a message that the security of the American people is becoming decoupled from that  of  our  allies.  In  Asia,  both  South Korea and Japan have the capability to deploy  nuclear  programs  of  their  own. Neither  has  done  so,  in  part,  because both  have  great  confidence  in  the  integrity  the  U.S.  security  guarantees and  in  the  U.S.  nuclear  umbrella  that extends  over  them.  They  also  believe that,  while  China  does  aspire  to  be  a regional  power,  the  threat  it  poses  is best  addressed  through  engagement and  efforts  to  anchor  China  in  the international  community.  Both  of these  assumptions  would  be  undermined  by  a  unilateral  U.S.  NMD  deployment. First,  our  ironclad  security  guarantees  will  be  perceived  by  the  Japanese, by  the  South  Koreans,  and  others,  as somewhat  rusty  if  we  pursue  a  current NMD  proposal  to  create  a  shield  over the U.S.  territory. U.S.  cities would  no longer  be  vulnerable  to  the  same threats  from  North  Korea  that  Seoul and Tokyo would continue to  face. And so  they  would  say:  Well,  there  is  a  decoupling;  we  don\u2019t  feel  as  safe  as  we did. Maybe  now  we  have  to make  decisions  to  nuclearize  ourselves  in  order to guarantee our own safety. China\u2019s  response  to  a  unilateral  U.S. NMD will make it, at least in the short term,  a  far  greater  threat  to  regional stability  than  it  poses  today.  If  South Korea  and  Japan  change  their  perceptions  both  of  the  threat  they  face  and of  U.S.  willingness  to  protect  them, they  then  could  both  be  motivated  to explore  independent  means  of  boosting their defenses. Then it becomes a world of greater tensions, not lesser tensions. It becomes a world of greater hair-trigger  capacity,  not  greater  safety-lock capacity. Our  European  allies  have  expressed the  same  concerns  about  decoupling  as I  have  expressed  about  Asia.  We  certainly  cannot  dismiss  the  calculations that  Great  Britain,  France,  and  Germany  will  make  about  the  impact  of the  U.S.  NMD  system.  But  I  believe their  concerns  hinge  largely  on  the  affect  a  unilateral  decision  would  have on  Russia,  concerns  that  would  be greatly  ameliorated  if  we  make  the NMD  decision  with  Russia\u2019s  cooperation. Finally,  much  has  been  made  of  the impact  a  U.S.  national  missile  defense system  would  have  and  what  it  would do  to  the  international  arms  control regime.  For  all  of  the  reasons  I  have just  discussed,  a  unilateral  decision would greatly damage U.S.  security  interests.  I  want  to  repeat  that.  It  will, in  fact, damage U.S. security  interests. The  history  of  unilateral  steps  in  advancing  strategic  weapons  shows  a very  clear  pattern  of  sure  response  and escalation.  In  1945,  the  United  States exploded  the  first  atomic  bomb.  The Soviets  followed  in  1949.  In  1948, we unveiled  the  first  nuclear-armed  intercontinental  bomber.  The  Soviets  followed  in  1955.  In  1952,  we  exploded  the first  hydrogen  bomb.  The  Soviets  followed  1  year  later.  In  1957,  the  Soviets beat us,  for the one time, and  launched the  first  satellite  into  orbit  and  perfected  the  first  ICBM. We  followed  suit within  12  months.  In  1960,  the  United States  fired  the  first  submarinelaunched  ballistic  missile.  The  Soviets followed  in  1968.  In  1964,  we  developed the  first  multiple  warhead  missile  and reentry  vehicle;  we  tested  the  first MIRV. The Soviets MIRVed in 1973, and so  on,  throughout  the  cold  war,  up until  the  point  that  we  made  a  different  decision\u2014the  ABM  Treaty  and reducing  the  level  of  nuclear  weapons. The  rationale  for  testing  and  deploying  a missile  defense  is  to make America  and  the  world  safer.  It  is  to  defend against a threat, however realistic, of a rogue  state/terrorist  launch  of  an ICBM,  or  an  accidental  launch.  No  one has been openly suggesting a public rationale  at  this  time  of  a  defense against  any  and  all  missiles,  such  as the  original  Star  Wars  envisioned,  but some have not given up on  that dream. It is, in fact, the intensity and tenacity of  their  continued  advocacy  for  such  a system  that  drives  other  people\u2019s  fears of  what  the  U.S.  may  be  up  to  and which  significantly  complicates  the test of selling even a limited and legitimately restrained architecture. Mr.  President,  in  diplomacy\u2014as  in life\u2014other  nations  and  other  people make  policies  based  not  only  on  real fears,  or  legitimate  reactions  to  an  advocacy/nonfriend\u2019s  actions,  but  they also  make  choices  based  on  perceived fears\u2014on  worst  case  scenarios  defined to  their  leaders  by  experts.  We  do  the same thing. The  problem  with  unilaterally  deployed  defense  architecture  is  that other  nations  may  see  intentions  and long-term  possibilities  that  negatively affect  their  sense  of  security,  just  as  it did  throughout  the  cold  war.  For  instance,  a  system  that  today  is  limited, but  exclusively  controlled  by  us  and exclusively  within  our  technological capacity is a system that they perceive could  be  expanded  and  distributed  at any  time  in  the  future  to  completely alter the balance of power\u2014the balance of terror as we have thought of it. That may  sound  terrific  to  us  and  even  be good  for us  for  a  short  period  of  time\u2014 but  every  lesson  of  the  arms  race  for the  last  55 years  shows  that  the  advantage  is  short  lived,  the  effect  is  simply to  require  everyone  to  build  more weapons  at  extraordinary  expense,  and the  advantage  is  inevitably  wiped  out with  the  world  becoming  a  more  dangerous  place  in  the  meantime.  That  is precisely  why  the  ABM  treaty  was  negotiated\u2014to  try  to  limit  the  unbridled competition,  stabilize  the  balance  and create  a  protocol  by  which  both  sides could confidently reduce weapons. The  negotiation  of  the  ABM  Treaty put  an  end  to  this  cycle  of  ratcheting up  the  strategic  danger.  After  20  years of trying to outdo each other\u2014building an  increasingly  dangerous,  increasingly  unstable  strategic  environment in  the  process\u2014we  recognized  that  deploying  strategic  defenses,  far  from ",

The  American  GI  has fought  in  the  trenches during  the First World  War,  the  beaches  at  Normandy, in  the  jungles  of  Vietnam,  in  the deserts  of  the  Persian  Gulf,  and  most recently in the Balkans and Kosovo. The  face  of  our military  and  the  people  who  fight  our  wars  has  changed. The  traditional  image  of  the  single, mostly  male,  drafted,  and  disposable soldier  is  gone.  Today  we  are  fielding the force for the 21st century. This new force  is  a  volunteer  force,  filled  with men and women who are highly skilled, married,  and  definitely  not  disposable. Gone  are  the  days  when  quality  of  life for a GI included a beer in the barracks and a three-day pass. Now, we know we have  to  recruit  a  soldier  and  retain  a family. We  have  won  the  cold  war.  This  victory  has  changed  the  world  and  our military.  The  new  world  order  has given  us  a  new  world  disorder.  The United  States  is  responding  to  crises around  the  globe\u2014whether  it  be  strategic  bombing  or  humanitarian  assistance\u2014and  our  military  is  the  most  effective response. In order to meet these challenges,  we  are  retooling  our  forces to  be  lighter,  leaner  and  meaner.  This is  a  positive  move.  Along  with  this lighter  force,  our  military  professionals  must  be  highly  educated  and highly trained. Our  nation  is  currently  experiencing the  longest  running  peacetime  economic  growth  in  history.  This  economic  expansion  has  been  a  boom  for our  nation.  However,  there  is  a  negative  impact  of  this  growing  economy. With  the  enticement  of  quick  prosperity  in  the  civilian  sector  it  is  more difficult than ever to recruit and retain our highly skilled force. In  fiscal year 99, the Army missed  its recruiting goals by 6,291 recruits, while the  Air  Force  missed  its  recruiting goal  by  1,732  recruits.  Pilot  retention problems  persist  for  all  services;  the Air  Force  ended  FY99  1,200  pilots  short and  the  Navy  ended  FY99  500  pilots short. The Army is having problems retaining  captains,  while  the  Navy  faces manning  challenges  for  Surface  Warfare  Officers  and  Special  Warfare  Officers.  It  is  estimated  than  $6  million  is spent  to  train  a  pilot.  We  as  a  nation cannot  afford  to  train  our  people,  only to  lose them to the private sector. It  is better to retain than retrain. There  is  hope  that  we  are  addressing these  challenges.  Last  year  was  a  momentous  year  for  our  military  personnel.  The  Senate  passed  legislation that  significantly enhances  the quality of life for our military personnel. From retirement  reform  to  pay  raises,  this Congress  is  on  record  supporting  our men  and  women  in  uniform.  However, more must be done. In  talking  with  our  military  personnel,  we  know  that  money  alone  is not  enough.  Education  is  the  number one  reason  service  members  come  into the  military  and  the  number  one  reason  its members  are  leaving. Last  year the  Senate  began  to  address  this  issue by  supporting  improved  education  benefits  for  military  members  and  their families.  Since  last  year, we  have  gone back  and  studied  this  issue  further.  In reviewing  the  current  Montgomery  GI bill, we  found  several disincentives and conflicts  among  the  education  benefits offered  by  the  services.  These  conflicts make  the  GI  bill,  an  earned  benefit, less attractive than it could be. My  amendment  will  improve  and  enhance  the  current  educational  benefits and  create  the  GI  bill  for  the  21st  century. One of the most important provisions of my amendment would give the Service  Secretaries  the  authority  to  authorize  a  service  member  to  transfer his  or  her  basic  MGIB  benefits  to  family  members.  Many  service  members tell us  that  they  really want  to  stay  in the  service,  but  do  not  feel  that  they can  stay  and  provide  an  education  for their  families.  This  will  give  them  an Educational  Savings  Account,  so  that they  can  stay  in  the  service  and  still provide  an  education  for  their  spouses and  children.  This  will  give  the  Secretaries  a  very  powerful  retention  tool. The  measure  would  allow  the  Services to  authorize  transfer  of  basic  GI  bill benefits  anytime  after  6  years  of  service.  To  encourage  members  to  stay longer,  the  transferred  benefits  could not be used until completion of at least 10  years  of  service.  I  believe  that  the Services can use this much  like a reenlistment  bonus  to  keep  valuable  service  members  in  the  service.  It  can  be creatively  combined  with  reenlistment bonuses  to  create  a  very  powerful  and cost  effective  incentive  for  highly skilled  military  personnel  to  stay  in the  Service.  In  talking  with  service members upon their departure from the military,  we  have  found  that  the  family  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  decision of a member to continue their military career.  Reality  dictates  that  we  must address the needs of the family in order to  retain  our  soldiers,  sailors,  airmen, and marines. My  amendment  would  also  give  the Secretaries  the  authority  to  authorize the  Veterans\u2019  Educational  Assistance Program  (VEAP)  participants  and those  active  duty  personnel  who  did not  enroll  in  MGIB  to  participate  in the current GI bill program. The VEAP participants  would  contribute  $1200, and  those  who  did  not  enroll  in  MGIB would  contribute  $1500.  The  services would  pay  any  additional  costs  of  the benefits of this measure. Another  enhancement  to  the  current MGIB would extend the period in which the  members  of  Reserve  components can  use  this  benefit.  Currently  they lose  this  benefit  when  they  leave  the service  or  after  10  years  of  service. They  have  no  benefit  when  they  leave service.  My  amendment  will  permit them  to  use  the  benefit  up  to  5  years after  their  separation.  This  will  encourage  them  to  stay  in  the  Reserves for  a  full  career.  Other  provisions  of this  amendment  would  allow  the  Service  Secretaries  to  pay  100  percent  tuition  assistance  or  enable  service  members  to  use  the  MGIB  to  cover  any  unpaid  tuition  and  expenses  when  the services don\u2019t pay 100 percent. Mr. President,  I believe  that  this  is a necessary  next  step  for  improving  our education  benefits  for  our  military members  and  their  families.  We  must offer  them  credible  choices.  If  we  offer them  choices,  and  treat  the  members and  their  families  properly,  we  will show them our respect for their service and  dedication.  Maybe  then  we  can turn  around  our  current  retention  statistics. This GI  bill  is  an  important  retention  tool  for  the  services.  I  believe that  education  begets  education.  We must continue to focus our resources in retaining  our  personnel  based  on  their needs. Mr.  LEVIN.

            "103": "June 8, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) S4743 myth  that Kimmel and Short were  singularly  responsible  for  the  disaster  at Pearl Harbor. Admiral Spruance, one of our  great  naval  commanders  of  World War  II,  shares  this  view.  He  put  it  this way: \u2018\u2018I  have  always  felt  that  Kimmel  and Short  were  held  responsible  for  Pearl Harbor in order that the American people  might  have  no  reason  to  lose  confidence  in  their  government  in  Washington.  This  was  probably  justifiable under  the  circumstances  at  that  time, but  it  does not  justify  forever  damning those two fine officers.\u2019\u2019 Mr. President, this is a matter of justice  and  fairness  that  goes  to  the  core of  our  military  tradition  and  our  nation\u2019s  sense  of  military  honor.  That, above, all should relieve us of any inhibition  to  doing  what  is  right  and  just. Mr.  President,  this  sense  of  the  Senate  has  been  endorsed  by  countless military  officers,  including  those  who have  served  at  the  highest  levels  of command.  These  include  former  Chairmen  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  Admiral  Thomas  H.  Moorer  and  Admiral William  J.  Crowe,  and  former  Chiefs  of Naval  Operations  Admiral  J.L.  Holloway III, Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt and Admiral Carlisle A.H. Trost. Moreover  a  number  of  public  organizations  have  called  for  posthumous  advancement  of  Kimmel  and  Short.  The VFW passed a resolution calling for the advancement  of  Admiral  Kimmel  and General Short. Let  me  add  that  Senator  Robert Dole,  one  of  our  most  distinguished colleagues  and  a  veteran  who  served heroically in World War II, has also endorsed  this  sense  of  the  Senate  resolution. Yesterday, June 6,  is a day that shall forever  be  remembered  as  a  date  of great  sacrifice  and  great  accomplishment  for  the men who  took  part  of Operation  Overload.  D-Day  marked  the turning of  the  tide  in  the allied war effort  in  Europe,  and  led  to  our  victory in the Second World War. December  7,  1941,  is  also  a  date  that will  forever  be  remembered.  That  day will  continue  to  be  \u2018\u2018a  date  which  will live  in  infamy.\u2019\u2019  It  will  serve  as  a  constant  reminder  that  the  United  States must  remain  vigilant  to  outside threats and to always be prepared. However,  this  amendment  is  about justice,  equity,  and  honor.  Its  purpose is  to  redress  an  historic  wrong,  to  ensure that Admiral Kimmel and General Short  are  treated  with  the  dignity  and honor  they  deserve,  and  to  ensure  that justice  and  fairness  fully  permeate  the memory  and  the  important  lessons learned  from  the  catastrophe  at  Pearl Harbor. As  we  commemorate  another  anniversary  of  the  success  of  D-Day,  it  is  a most  appropriate  time  to  redress  this injustice.  After  50  years,  this  correction  is  long  overdue.  I  urge  my  colleagues to support this amendment. Mr.  BIDEN.  Mr.  President,  I  and  colleagues\u2014Senators  ROTH,  and  reintroducing  THURMOND\u2014are  KENNEDY, my an amendment that the Senate passed last year to provide long overdue justice for the  two  fine  military  officers,  Admiral Husband  Kimmel  and  General  Walter Short. Last year the Senate voted to include this amendment  in the Defense authorization  bill,  but  because  the  House  had not  considered  such  a  provision,  it  was not  included  in  the  final  conference  report. This  year,  having  had  time  to  consider  the  facts,  the  House  Armed  Services  Committee  included  the  exact same  language  that  the  Senate  passed last  year  in  their  fiscal  year  2001  Defense  authorization  bill,  which  passed the full House on May 18. I  also  want  to  remind  my  colleagues that  this  resolution  has  the  support  of various  veterans  groups,  including  the Veterans  of  Foreign  Wars  (VFW)  and the  Pearl  Harbor  Survivors  Association.  It  is  also  a  move  supported  by former  Chiefs  of  Naval  Operations,  including  Admirals  Thomas  H.  Moorer, Carlisle  Trost,  J.L.  Holloway  III,  William J. Crowe, and Elmo Zumwalt. As  most  of  you  know,  Admiral  Kimmel  and  General  Short  commanded U.S. forces in the Pacific at the time of the  1941  attack  on Pearl Harbor. Afterwards,  they were blamed as completely responsible  for  the  success  of  that  attack. I  will  not  go  through  an  exhaustive review  of  this  case.  I  think  the  amendment  itself  provides  the  facts  and  the record  from  last year\u2019s  debate was  also quite  thorough.  Instead,  I  want  to  review  the  reasons  I  think  this  is  the right action to take. For  me,  this  issue  comes  down  to basic  fairness  and  justice.  It  was  entirely  appropriate  for  President  Roosevelt to decide to relieve these officers of  their  command  immediately  following  the  attack.  Not  only  was  it  his prerogative  as  Commander  in  Chief,  he also  needed  to  make  sure  the  nation had  confidence  in  its  military  as  it headed  into  war.  So,  I  can  understand the  need,  at  that  time,  to  make  them the  scapegoats  for  the  devastating  defeat.  What  I  do  not  accept  is  that  the decisions  of  this  government  in  those extreme  times  have  been  left  to  stand for the past 59 years. To  be  more  specific,  it  was  a  conscious  decision  by  the  government  to actively  release  a  finding  of  \u2018\u2018dereliction of duty\u2019\u2019 a mere month after Pearl Harbor.  Not  one  of  the  many  subsequent and  substantially more thorough investigations  to  follow  agreed  with that  finding.  Even  worse,  the  findings of the official reviews done by the military  in  the  Army  and  Navy  Inquiry Boards  of  1944\u2014saying  that  Kimmel and  Short\u2019s  forces  were  properly  disposed\u2014were  classified  and  kept  from the public. Think  about  it.  We  are  a  nation proud  to  have  a  civilian  led  military. The  concept  of  civilian  rule  is  basic  to our  notion  of  democracy.  This  means that the civilian leadership also has responsibilities  to  the  members  of  its military. The  families of Admiral Kimmel  and  General  Short  were  vilified. They  received  death  threats.  Yet,  Admiral  Kimmel  and  General  Short  were denied  their  requests  for  a  court  martial. They were not allowed to properly defend themselves and their honor. Whatever  the  exigencies  of  wartime, it  is  unconscionable  that  government actions  which  vilified  these  men  and their  families  should  continue  to  stand 59  years  later.  It  is  appropriate  that government  action  be  taken  to  rectify this. There are very few official acts we can  take  to  rectify  this.  The  one  suggested  by  this  amendment  is  to  advance  these  officers  on  the  retirement list. They were the only two officers eligible  for  such  advancement  after  Congress  passed  the  1947  Officer  Personnel Act, denied that advancement. I also want to point out that I do not believe  this  is  rewriting  history  or shifting  blame,  instead,  it  is  acknowledging  the  truth.  The  1995  report  by then Undersecretary Edward Dorn said, \u2018\u2018Responsibility  for  the  Pearl  Harbor disaster  should  not  fall  solely  on  the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant  General  Short,  it  should  be broadly  shared.\u2019\u2019  To  say  that  and  then take  no  action  to  identify  others  responsible  or  to  rectify  the  absolute scapegoating  of  these  two  officers  is  to say  that  military  officers  can  be  hung out  to  dry  and  cannot  expect  fairness from their civilian government. Again,  with  civilian  leadership, comes  responsibility.  This  advancement  on  the  retirement  ranks  involves no  compensation.  Instead,  it  upholds the  military  tradition  that  responsible officers  take  the  blame  for  their  failures, not  for  the  failures of others. The unfortunate  reality  is  that  Admiral Kimmel  and  General  Short  were blamed  entirely  and  forced  into  early retirement. As Members of Congress we face no  statute  of  limitations  on  treating  honorable  people  with  frankness and  finding  out  the  truth  so  that  we can learn from our mistakes. By  not  taking  any  action  to  identify those  who  Undersecretary  Dorn  says share  the  blame,  we  have  denied  our military  the  opportunity  to  learn  from the  multiple  failures  that  gave  Japan the  opportunity  to  so  devastate  our fleet. This  is  not  to  say  that  the  sponsors of this amendment want to place blame in  a  new  quarter.  This  is  not  a  witchhunt  aimed  at  those  superior  officers who were advanced  in rank and continued  to  serve,  despite  being  implicated in  the  losses  at  Pearl  Harbor.  Instead, it validates  that  the historic  record, as it  is  becoming  clearer  and  clearer,  is correct  to  say  that  blame  should  be shared.  This  amendment  validates  the instincts  of  those  historians  who  have sought  the  full  story  and  not  the  simply  black-and-white  version  needed  by a  grieving  nation  immediately  following the attack. So,  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support this  amendment  again  this  year.  Quite simply,  in  the  name  of  truth,  justice, ",

Mr.  President,  I rise  to make  a  few  remarks  concerning an amendment  to  the National Defense Authorization  Act  (S.  2549)  that  would establish  a  commission  to  assess  the future  of  the  United  States  aerospace industry  and  to  make  recommendations  for  actions  by  the  Federal  Government  to  improve  this  industries global competitiveness. The  modern  aerospace  industry  fulfills  vital  roles  for  our  nation.  It  is  a pillar  of  the  business  community  that employs 800,000 skilled workers. It is an engine  of  economic  growth  that  generated a net trade surplus of $37 billion in  1998,  larger  than  any  other  industrial  sector.  It  is  a  working  model  of private-public  partnership,  yielding commercial  and  military  benefits  that have  enhanced  our  communication  and transportation  networks  while  enabling  the  aerospace  dominance  demonstrated  in  both  Kosovo  and  the  Gulf War.  And  its  well-known  products, from  the  Boeing  777  to  the  Blackhawk helicopter  to  the  Space  Shuttle,  serve as  fitting  symbols  of  American  preeminence  in  an  inter-connected  world that thrives on speed and technology. Unfortunately,  this  key  industrial sector  is  facing  new  challenges  to  its leadership  role  in  the  global  economy. Since  1985,  foreign  competition  has  cut the  American  share  of  the  worldwide aerospace market  from  72 percent  to  56 percent.  In  order  to  remain  competitive,  we  must  reevaluate  industrial regulations  enacted  during  the  Cold War,  that  might  hamper  innovation, flexibility, and growth. We must reconsider our defense research priorities, to counteract  the  50% decline  in domestic funding  for  aerospace  research  and  development  during  the  last  decade.  We must  reexamine  the  rules  that  govern export  of  aerospace  products  and  technologies,  and  develop  policies  that  permit access to global markets while protecting  national  security.  we  must  assess  all  of  these  areas  in  light  of  new trade  agreements  that may  require  adjustments  to  federal  regulations  and policies.  Ultimately,  we  must  assess the  future  of  the  aerospace  industry and  ensure  that  government  policy plays  a  positive  role  in  its  development. To  accomplish  this  goal,  this  amendment  calls  for  the  creation  of  a  Presidential  commission  empowered  to  recommend  action  to  the  federal  government  regarding  the  future  of  the  aerospace  industry.  The  commission  shall be  composed  of  experts  in  aerospace manufacturing,  national  security,  and related economic  issues, as well as  representatives  of  organized  labor.  The commission  is  directed  to  study  economic and national security issues confronting  the  aerospace  industry,  such as  the  state  of  government  funding  for aerospace  research  and  procurement, the  rules  governing  exportation  of aerospace  goods  and  technologies,  the effect  of  current  taxation  and  trade policies  on  the  aerospace  industry,  and the  adequacy  of  aerospace  science  and engineering  education  in  institutions of  higher  learning.  I  urge  the  Congress to  support  the creation of  the Commission  and  the  next  President  to  support its  activities  and  heed  its  counsel.  By creating  such  a  commission  and through  careful  consideration  of  these complex issues, we can ensure that this valuable  American  industry  soars  into the 21st century, turbulence-free.

            "119": "June 8, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) S4759 the  responsibility  of  the  federal  government\u2014and  I  have  voted  against most of  the bills  that  include  this kind of  funding.  Here  we  have  a  clear  instance where  the  actions  of  the  federal government  is  responsible  for  the  actions it has taken and the negligence it has  shown  against  its  own  people. Peoples\u2019  health  has  been  compromised  and lives  have  been  lost.  In  many  instances,  these  workers  didn\u2019t  even know that their health and safety were in  jeopardy.  It  is  not  only  a  responsibility of this government to provide for these  individuals,  it  is  a  moral  obligation. My  belief  that  we  have  a  moral  obligation  to  these  people  was  strengthened  last  October  when  I  attended  a public  meeting  of  workers  from  the Portsmouth  Gaseous  Diffusion  Plant.  I learned an incredible amount about the integrity  of  the  hard-working  men  and women  and  what  they  have  been through. I  heard  heart-wrenching  stories  from people  like Ms. Anita George, a  23 year employee at Piketon who testified that \u2018\u2018I only know of one woman that works in  my  department  that  has  not  had  a hysterectomy  and  other  reproductive problems.\u2019\u2019 Ms. George described a situation  where  she  and  two  of  her  colleagues  were  exposed  to  an \u2018\u2018outgassing\u2019\u2019  on  a  \u2018\u2018routine\u2019\u2019  decontamination job. After  the  exposure,  the women  started  to  experience  health  problems,  including  heavy  bleeding,  elevated  white blood  cell  counts  and  kidney  infections.  Plant  physicians  told  them  that they  should  \u2018\u2018just  lie  down  and  rest\u2019\u2019  if they had any problems while they were working.  Three  years  after  the  exposure,  all  three  women  had  had hysterectomies.  The  plant  denied  their workers\u2019 compensation claims. I also heard  from people  like Mr. Jeff Walburn,  another  23-year  plant  employee and  former councilman and vice mayor  of  the  city  of  Portsmouth,  who testified  that  while  working  in  one  of the  buildings,  he  became  so  sick  that his  lungs  \u2018\u2018granulated.\u2019\u2019  When  he  went to  the  infirmary,  they  said  he  was \u2018\u2018okay  for  work.\u2019\u2019  Later  that  day,  he went  to  the  hospital  because  in  his words,  \u2018\u2018my  face  was  peeling  off.\u2019\u2019  According  to  Mr.  Walburn,  he  couldn\u2019t speak,  his  hair  started  falling  out,  his lungs  started  \u2018\u2018coming  out\u2019\u2019  and  his bowels  failed to  function  for more than 6 days. When he went to get his records to  file  his  worker\u2019s  compensation claim,  he  was  told  that  his  diagnosis had been \u2018\u2018changed, been altered.\u2019\u2019 The  Department  of  Energy  has  held similar  public  meetings  at  facilities across the nation\u2014these stories are not unique  to the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant. Mr.  President,  it  is  unfortunate  that this  amendment  is  necessary  in  the first  place;  the  compensation  it  will provide  is  little  consolation  for  the pain,  health  problems  and  diminished quality  of  life  that  these  individuals have  suffered.  These  men  and  women won  the  cold  war.  Now,  they  simply ask  that  their  government  acknowledge  that  they  were  made  ill  in  the course  of  doing  their  job  and  recognize that  the government must  take  care of them. Until  recently,  the only way many of these  employees  believed  they  would ever receive proper restitution for what the  government  has  done  to  them  is  to file  a  lawsuit  against  the  Department of  Energy  or  its  contractors.  But,  in the  time  that  I  have  been  involved  in this  issue  in  the  Senate,  the  Department  of  Energy  has  come  a  long  way from  its  decades-long  stance  of stonewalling  and  denial  of  responsibility.  Today,  they  admit  that  they have  wronged  our  cold  war  heroes. Still, we must do more. I  believe  that  all  those  who  have served our nation  fighting the cold war have a right to know if the federal government  was  responsible  for  causing them  illness  or  harm,  and  if  so,  to  provide  them  the  care  and  compensation that they need and deserve. That is the purpose  of  our  amendment,  and  I  am pleased  to  join  with  my  colleagues  in support of its acceptance in this bill. Mr.  MURKOWSKI.  Mr.  President,  I rise  as  a  cosponsor  in  support  of  the amendment, and thank all the sponsors for their work in this area. The  purpose  of  this  amendment,  put simply,  is  to  provide  compensation  to workers  who  have  gotten  sick  as  a  result of their exposure to hazardous materials  in  the  course  of  their  efforts  to build  and  test  nuclear  weapons.  We must  do  right  by  these  workers.  They were  instrumental  in  winning  the  cold war.  Their  efforts  deterred  hostile  attack and safeguarded our security. I  want  to  highlight  a  small  group  of those  workers  who  toiled  on  a  remote island  in Alaska  to  test  the  largest underground nuclear weapons test our nation ever conducted. Amchitka  is  an  island  in  the  Aleutian  arc  1340  miles  southwest  of  Anchorage.  As  I  mentioned,  it  is  the  site of the largest underground nuclear test in  U.S.  history\u2014the  so-called  \u2018\u2018Cannikin\u2019\u2019 test of 1971. This 5 megaton test was preceded by  two prior  tests:  \u2018\u2018Long Shot,\u2019\u2019  an  80  kiloton  test  in  1965;  and \u2018\u2018Milrow,\u2019\u2019 a 1 megaton test in 1969. According  to  an  independent  investigator,  Dr.  Rosalie  Bertell,  the  ionizing radiation  exposure  above  normal  background levels experienced by Amchitka workers  ranged  from  669  up  to  17,240 milliren/year.  Workers  exposures  at Amchitka were primarily due to: Groundwater  transport  of  tritium from the Longshot test; Radionuclides  stored  on  site  or  used in  the  shaft,  including  scandium  46, cesium  137,  and  other  radioactive  diagnostic capsuled sources; Radioactive  thermoelectric  ator (RTG) use; Material  released  from  the  re-entry operations in 1972; Unfortunately,  it  appears  that  The Atomic  Energy  Commission\u2014the  predecessor  of  today\u2019s  Department  of  EnCannikin generergy\u2014did  not  provide  for  the  proper protection  of  these  workers.  According to Dr. Bertell: Although the workers were apparently told that  their  work  was  not  \u2018hazardous,\u2019  they were  actually  classified  as  nuclear  workers and  were  exposed  to  levels  of  ionizing  radiation  from  non-natural  and/or  non-normal sources,  above  the  level  which  at  that  time was  permitted  yearly  for  the  general  public, namely  500  mrem/year . . . Doses  received by  the  men  during  special  assignments  and during  the  post-Cannikin  cleanup,  exceeded the  permissible  quarterly  dose  of  1250  mrem and  the maximum permissible yearly dose of 5000 mrem. I would note that the allowable exposure  standards  for  both  workers  and the  general  public  are  much  lower today. The  actual  amount  of  radiation  the Amchitka  workers  were  exposed  to  is difficult  to  quantify,  Mr.  President. These  workers  generally  did  not  have the  protection  of  radiation  safety training  or  instruction  in  the  proper usage  of  Thermoluminescent Dosimeters  (TLDs).  To  make  matters even  worse,  exposure  records  were  not kept  in  many  cases  by  the  AEC.  Some of  the  records  that  were  kept  by  AEC were  later  lost.  While  this  was  not  unusual in the very early years of the nuclear age, radiation protection formalities  were  well  established  by  the  late 1960s  and  1970s  at  the  time  of  the  Amchitka tests. Yet the proper procedures were  not  followed  and  the  proper records were not kept. So  although  these  were  some  likely exposures,  the  records  that  could  help these  workers  make  a  claim  under  existing  authority  do  not  exist  through no  fault  of  their  own.  That  is  the  reason  that  Amchitka  workers  are  included  in  the  \u2018\u2018Special  Exposure  Cohort\u2019\u2019  with  the  workers  at  the  Gaseous Diffusion  Plants  in  Portsmouth,  Ohio; Paducah,  Kentucky;  and  Oak  Ridge, Tennessee.  If  a  member  of  the  special exposure cohort gets a specified disease listed  in  the amendment  that  is known to  be  associated  with  ionizing  radiation,  her  or  she  is  entitled  to  appropriate compensation. I  appreciate  the  work  of  Senator and  others,  and  the  consideration given us by the floor managers. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

FEDERAL AGENADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT.\u2014The  APPLICABILITY OF OTHER TERMINATION Mr.  WARNER.  Mr.  President,  Senator DODD is recognized as one who has devoted  much  of  his  career  to  Central America.  I  have  traveled  with  him  in years  past  to  those  regions  of  the world,  particularly  in  troubled  times.  I respect  his  judgment  and  I  am  pleased that  he  has  joined  on  the Warner-Dodd amendment. It relates to Cuba. Senator DODD and I, in the 105th Congress,  put  in  legislation  to  allow  the sale  of  food  and medicine  to  Cuba.  Unfortunately, it was not accepted. We renewed  that  effort.  That  was  in  the 105th,  and  we  renewed  it  in  the  106th. Unfortunately, it was not able to be accepted by the Senate. This  Nation  has  experienced  the Elian  Gonzalez  case,  a  most  unusual chapter in history. I am not here to describe  it  because  much  of  that  case  is clearly  in  the minds  of Americans. But if  there  is  some  value  out  of  that  case, it  has  awakened  America  to  the  seriousness of this problem between the relationship of our Nation and Cuba. We have had various policies in effect for  some  30-plus years and,  in my  judgment,  those  policies  have  not  moved Fidel  Castro.  But  Fidel  Castro  is  a leader  who  does  not  have  my  respect, and  I  think  many  in  this  Chamber would share my view, if not all. ",
            "135": "June 8, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) S4775 present  system  of  527,  Chinese  money, drug  money,  Mafia  money,  anybody\u2019s money  can  come  into  American  political  campaigns,  and  there  is  no  reason to disclose it. So now here we are with 100 Members of  this  Senate  all  saying  we  need  full disclosure,  using  a  constitutional  facade which is not correct as a reason to vote  against  this  amendment  and  vote it down. I say again, for the third time, if it is a constitutional objection, and that objection  is  legitimate,  then  the  Senator from  Virginia  and  the  Senator  from Colorado  have  no  reason  to  object  to this amendment being made part of the next  appropriate  vehicle  which  is deemed  appropriate  by  the  Parliamentarian.  And  by  so  objecting  to  that unanimous  consent  agreement,  their defense  or  their  argument  that  somehow  we  are  harming  the  Defense  authorization  bill  does  not  have  credibility. Mr.  President,  I  do  not want  to  yield all  the  time.  I would  be  glad  to  engage in  this.  But  I  wondered  what  would happen  last  night  after  we  proposed this  amendment  for  full  disclosure.  I wondered.  I wondered what  the  defense against  cleaning  up  at  least  to  some degree,  allowing  the  American  people to know who are contributing to American  political  campaigns  in  unprecedented amounts of money, would be. I repeat, one more time,  I yield to no one  in  this  body  as  to my  advocacy  for our  Nation\u2019s  defense  and  the  men  and women  in  the military.  But  if  we  want to  give  these  men  and  women  in  the military  confidence  in  their  Government,  we  should  have  fully  disclosed who  it  is  that  contributes  to  the  political campaigns. I yield the floor. Several  Senators  Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished  Senator  from  Arizona  and  I go  back  a  very  long  way.  When  I  was Secretary of the Navy, he was incarcerated  as  a  consequence  of  his  heroic service  in  Vietnam.  His  father  was among  if  not  the most  valued  adviser  I had during the turbulent period of that war  when  I  had  the  responsibility  for the  Department  of  the  Navy.  That  was for over 5 years, 1969 through 1974. I have the highest personal regard for my  friend  and  my  colleague,  whom  I have  worked  with  from  the  day  he  returned to the United States of America to  be  welcomed  quite  properly  as  a hero. I  know  for  a  fact  that  he  has  always foremost in his mind, every day that he draws  a  breath,  every  day  the  great Lord  of  ours  gives  him  the  strength  to take up his responsibilities, the welfare of  the  men  and  women  of  the  Armed Forces.  I  find  it  very  awkward  to  be  in a  position  to  be  in  opposition  to  my friend,  but  the  rules  are  quite  clear  of the  House  that  it  is  a  matter  of  privilege  of  the  House  regarding  the  conaddressed  Senthe to it  as  relates  provision  stitutional  taxation. It  has  been  a  matter  of  privilege since  the  inception  of  this  Republic. That  privilege  is  determined  by  the House  in  the  course  of  resolutions.  If this  bill  goes  over,  then  they  adopt  a resolution. We know  from  consultation there  are  Members  of  the  House  who will  absolutely  take  that  resolution  to the  floor,  and  there  is  no  doubt  that this bill will be blue-slipped, and it will be  torpedoed  and  go  to  the  bottom  of Davy Jones\u2019 locker. I yield the floor. Mrs.  FEINSTEIN.  Mr.  President,  I rise  in  support  of  the  amendment  offered  by  the  Senator  from  Arizona  to require  the  disclosure  of  donors  to  taxexempt  groups  who  engage  in  political activities. These  groups  use  an  obscure provision  of  the  Tax  Code\u2014section 527\u2014to  shield  the  identity  of  contributors  and  use  the  funds  to make  anonymous  attacks  on  candidates  for  public office. Section  527  organizations  represent the  latest  attempt  to  bypass  campaign finance  laws  and  pour  undisclosed money  in  the  electoral  process.  There is  no  official  public  information  about the  number  of  such  groups,  who  their officers  are,  where  the  money  is  coming from, and how it is being spent. Section  527  of  the  Tax  Code  was  enacted  to  provide  candidates,  political parties,  and  PAC\u2019s  with  special  tax treatment.  These  groups  are  required to  register  with  the  Federal  Election Commission  and  disclose  contribution and expenditure information. In recent years, however, the IRS has ruled  that  organizations  which  intend to influence the outcome of an election but  do not  expressly  advocate  the  election  of  a  candidate  qualify  as  a  political  organization  but  are  not  required to  file  with  the  FEC.  These  groups  can raise and spend as much money as they want  to  influence  an  election,  but  the public  has  no  information  on  who  or what they are. This  is  precisely  the  sort  of  activity that makes the political process appear corrupt  and  undemocratic.  The  American  public  is  becoming  increasingly disenchanted  and  uninterested  in  electoral  process  because  they  feel  their voices  are  being  drowned  out  by  soft money donations to political parties. In  the  case  of  soft  money,  however, at least the amount of the contribution and  the  name  of  the  group  or  person who  is  making  the  donation  must  be registered  with  the  Federal  Election Commission.  These  groups  spend  unlimited  amounts  of money  and  none  of it has to be disclosed. This insidious hijacking  of  the  campaign  finance  system must be corrected. It  is  a  simple  fact  that  the American public believes that large contributions are  made  to  influence  decisions  being made  in  Washington.  They  are  becomingly  increasingly  cynical  of  the  process  and  fewer  and  fewer  people  are  participating in elections. In  1996,  voter  turnout  was  48.8  percent\u2014the  lowest  level  since  1924. Turnthe  Who Senthank  MCCAIN Senator out  for  the  1998  mid-term  election  was 36  percent\u2014the  lowest  for  a  nonpresidential  election  in  56  years.  Congress has a responsibility to take steps to reverse this trend. The  first  step  should  be  to  require the  disclosure  of  contributors  to  taxexempt  organizations.  The  Senate must  act  to  close  this  loophole  and  we must do it now. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  yields time? Mr.  WARNER.  Mr.  President,  I  yield such  time  as  my  distinguished  colleague desires. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Colorado. Mr.  ALLARD.  I  from Virginia. Mr.  President,  I  came  to  the  floor  to talk  about  the  importance  of  the  authorization  of  the  Department  of  Defense. This is an important piece of legislation.  I  am  not  here  to  impugn  the motives  of  some  of  the  other  Members of  the  Senate  or  to  try  to mischaracterize  what  their  reasons might be for coming to the floor. This  is  a  good  piece  of  legislation. Senator  from  Arizona  is  certainly a hero  in my mind; he continues to  be  that.  I  know  he  is  trying  to  do what he thinks is best for this country. I  respect  that.  I  think  we  have  before us  a  very  important  piece  of  legislation. We should not put it at risk. This  is  an  authorization  bill  that  increases,  by  some  $4.5  billion,  defense spending  over  what  the  President  proposed.  It  is  a  4.4-percent  increase  in real  terms  over  what  we  spent  last year.  If  there  is  anything  we  have  neglected  over  the  last  several  years  in the budget, it is our defense. We  have  been  obligating  our  troops overseas.  In  fact,  if  we  look  at  the record,  between  1956  and  1992,  our troops  were  deployed  some  51  times. Between  1992  and  today,  we  had  the same  number  of  deployments.  At  the same  time  we  are  increasing  our  reliability  on  our  fighting  men  and women,  we  are  cutting  their  budget.  I think that is inexcusable. It  is  time  Congress  recognized  what the  problem  is  that  the  President  of the  United  States  in  particular  recognizes: We are not appreciating the service  of  our  men  and  women  in  the Armed Forces. With  this  legislation, we  begin  to  appreciate  the  dedication  and  hard  work of  the  men  and  women  who  have  been serving us  in  the Armed Forces. Again, I thank Chairman WARNER for allowing me  another  opportunity  to  speak  in strong  support  of  this  essential  bill  for our  men  and  women  in  the  Armed Forces. This  bill  is  a  fitting  tribute  for  those who  served,  are  serving,  and  will  serve in  the  armed  services  in  the  future. The  defense  bill  is  simply  too  important  to  be  mired  in  political  goals  but should  show  them  respect  and  provide them  the  best  defense  authorization bill we possibly can. ",

Let\u2019s  be  clear.  This  is  a  rifle  shot  on this  bill.  This  does  not  cover  labor unions,  this  does  not  cover  the  Sierra Club,  this  does  not  cover  the  trial  lawyers, all of which are the major funders of the other side of the aisle. I  am  one  of  those  Senators  up  for  reelection  who  is  going  to  be  at  the  butt end  of  the  expenditures  of  those  very same groups, and no one over there will be  outraged  by  the  \u2018\u2018damage  to  the public,\u2019\u2019 these groups do. They are only concerned  about  the  damage  to  the public  that  groups  that  do  not  favor them do. We  heard  so  much:  We  need  to  talk honestly  with  the  public.  Let\u2019s  talk honestly  with  the  public.  We  are  rifle shooting  here.  We  are  killing  the American  political  process  by  picking winners and losers. At  the  same  time,  the  second  reason I oppose this bill is because we are killing the Defense authorization. So  we  have  two  losers  here.  We  have the political process\u2014the big loser\u2014because  here  we  are  in  Congress  picking winners  and  losers. And  the  second, we have  the  Defense  authorization  process,  which  I,  as  a  subcommittee  chairman,  and  like  my  colleague  from  Arkansas,  a  subcommittee  chairman,  we put  a  lot  of  time  and  effort  into  this bill  because  we  understand,  as  the chairman  of  the  Readiness  Subcommittee, Jim INHOFE, said, we put in a  lot  of  effort  trying  to  craft  a  bipartisan bill. We  don\u2019t  have  too  many  coming  to the  floor  these  days.  It  is  a  bipartisan bill.  I  have  worked  with  my  ranking member,  We  have worked  together  in  concert  to  put  together  a  bill  we  can  all  support\u2014and we  all  did  support  in  committee \u2014that really meets  the  needs  of  our military, that  addresses  some  of  the  critical issues we had  in our  subcommittee. We had  to  deal  with  the  transformation  of the  Army.  I  know  everybody  in  this Chamber  is  concerned  about  how  we transform the Army. There  are  some  very  critical  decisions  we  made  in  this  bill  that  affect the  future  of  our  armed  services,  and particularly  the Army,  that  I  don\u2019t  believe  will  be  made  correctly  if  we  do not pass this bill. There  are  some  critical  issues  in  the area  of  the  Joint  Strike  Fighter.  We made  tough  decisions  that  will  not  be met if we do not pass this bill. A  lot  of  people  say  we  can  wait.  The House  may  not  blue-slip  this.  The House  voted  on  this  issue.  They  voted it down. We know what  they will do on this  issue.  The  fact  is,  even  if  that  is not  the  case,  this  is  not  the  right amendment.  This  is  not  the  right  way to address this issue. If  you  care  about  the  \u2018\u2018corruption  of the  system\u2019\u2019  that  these  organizations do,  cover  everybody.  If  you  care  about gaining  political  advantage,  vote  for this  amendment  because  you  will  gain LIEBERMAN.  JOE political  advantage.  You  will  put  a chilling  effect  on  some  groups  and \u2018\u2018Katie  bar  the  door\u2019\u2019  on  the  others.  If that  is  what  you  want,  if  what  you want  is political advantage, you got  it. Vote  for  it  and  kill  both  fairness  in public discourse and disclosure, which I am for. I  will  vote  for  an  amendment\u2014but not  on  this  bill  because  I  think  it  will hurt this bill\u2014at some time. I hope the leader  brings  up  this  issue.  But  make sure we cover everybody. Make sure we do not pick our  friends: You don\u2019t have to say anything. You don\u2019t have to disclose  anything.  And  by  the  way,  you guys  who  we  really  don\u2019t  like,  we  are going  to  get  you. We  are  going  to  chill your  contributions.  We  are  going  to make you report everything. That  is  what  this  is  about,  folks.  If we are  talking about honesty here,  tell the  truth.  What  does  your  amendment do? That is the truth. So I am happy to debate  the  truth.  The  truth  is,  I  will support  an  amendment  that  is  broad.  I will  support  an  amendment  that  provides  disclosure  for  everybody  who  engages  in  political  campaigns  but  not pick my friends over my enemies. I  would  not  vote  for  a  bill  that  just picks my  friends. Even you  said we  are not going  to  cover  those organizations, Senator,  that  help  you;  we  are  just going  to  cover  the  guys  who  do  not help  you,  I  would  vote  against  it.  Do you  know  why?  Because  we  should  not be doing that. That is wrong. You want to talk about breeding cynicism? Bring up  an  amendment  that  calls  for  disclosure  which  excludes  the  groups  that favor  you  and  punishes  the  ones  that don\u2019t, that brings cynicism to the process. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator\u2019s time has expired. Several  Senators  Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Wisconsin. Mr.  MCCAIN.  Can  ator for 30 seconds? Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes. Mr.  MCCAIN.  Mr.  President,  apparently  the  Senator  from  Pennsylvania does  not  agree  with  the  Bush  campaign,  in  which,  according  to  an  AP story, Bush says: addressed  engage  SenSenSenthe I  the  Plenty  of  left-leaning  AFL-CIO help Democrats. groups  led  by  the The AP goes on to say: So  far  for  Gore,  the  Sierra  Club,  an  environmental  group  and  one  of  the  first  to  create a 527 spin-off, is in the midst of an $8 million  ad  campaign  aiding  Democrats  running for Congress and attacking Bush on the environment. I  don\u2019t know where  the Senator  from Pennsylvania  has  been,  but  I  will  be glad to show him ample testimony that this comes  from both the  left and right equally.  So  the  evidence  is  obviously contrary to that. I  would  also  hope  that  the  Senator from Pennsylvania would  join  the  Senator  from  Wisconsin  and  me  where  the next  amendment  would  be  one  that  included all organizations. the  Senator Would the Senator from Wisconsin be willing  to  do  that  as  well?  The  fact  is, this  is most egregious, because there  is no  reporting  whatsoever  in  this  newfound  cornucopia,  which  would  allow the Mafia, drug money, Chinese money, any  other  kind  of money,  to  come  into American  political  campaigns  undisclosed. If that is what the Senator from Pennsylvania  believes  is  honesty,  then I plead guilty. Mr.  FEINGOLD.  In  response  to  the question  of  the  Senator  from  Arizona, the  Senator  from  Pennsylvania,  fortunately,  is  plain  wrong  about  the  issue of whether this covers other groups. As the  Senator  from  Arizona  said,  in  my opening  remarks,  I  say  to  the  Senator from  Pennsylvania,  I  pointed  out  that this  doesn\u2019t  just  cover  the  Sierra  Club. The Sierra Club has said it has a 527 organization  to  use  very  large  donations from  wealthy  individuals  totaling  $4.5 million. How  can  the  Senator  from  Pennsylvania  even  begin  to  say  that  we  have not  included  groups  on  both  sides? The amendment is evenhanded. As  the  Senator  from  Arizona  has pointed  out,  there  were  reports  of groups  from both  the  right and the  left using  this  loophole.  Any  group  claiming  this  loophole  would  have  to  disclose.  So  it  is  simply  false  that  it would not include them. Mr.  SANTORUM.  Will  yield for a question? Mr.  FEINGOLD.  time. I  also  point  out  that  the  AFL\u2013CIO has  also  said  it  is  willing  to  make  further  disclosure  itself  as  long  as  business  is  willing  to  do  the  same.  I  would invite the other side to actually offer a real  amendment\u2014not  a  sense  of  the Senate,  but  a  real  amendment\u2014to  try to address this. It  is  simply  untrue  that  we  are  not covering groups on both sides. I specifically  mentioned  the  Sierra  Club  and $4.5 million to cover that. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. WARNER.  I  yield  to  the  Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr.  SANTORUM.  I  ask  the  Senator from  Kentucky,  does  the  Sierra  Club run  some  of  their  campaign  expenditures  through  their  (c)(4),  not  through their 527 group? Mr. MCCONNELL.  I  say  to my  friend from  Pennsylvania,  if  this  bill  passed, 527s  that  do  only  issue  advocacy  would have  to  publicly  disclose  their  donors. But  other  tax-exempt  groups  that  do exactly  the  same  kinds  of  issue  ads, such  as  501(c)(4)s,  such  as  the  Sierra Club,  and  501(c)(5)s,  such  as  the  AFLCIO,  would  not  have  to  publicly  disclose their donors. So  the  problem  is,  if  the  idea  is  to have  comprehensive  disclosure,  we have  left  out  a  huge  percentage  of those  who  are  involved  in  political  activity.  The  two  that  I  mentioned  happen  to  almost  always  be  in  support  of candidates  on  the  other  side  of  the aisle.  It  would  also  not  include  the American  Trial  Lawyers  Association. limited have  We  ",

I  am  just  very  displeased,  I  guess, that  language  be  used  that  there  is  intransigence,  we  had  no  choice  but  to bring  this  to  the  floor.  If  anybody wanted  to  pass  a  bill  and  have  it  become  law,  this  is  the  last  thing  they should  do.  And  have  press  conferences blasting  the  process.  This  process  has been open. This process has been bipartisan.  This  process  has  tried  to  reach across  and  bridge  differences  and  compromise.  Yet  they  say,  we  don\u2019t  care what  you  have  done.  As  a  matter  of fact,  did  they  offer  the  compromise,  an appeals process that has been agreed to by  Democrats  and  Republicans?  No, they  came  back  and  said,  we  want  the House  bill,  an  inferior  product  compared  to what we have agreed  to  in  the appeals process, far inferior. It  is  the  same  with  some  of  the  patient  protections.  We  have  strengthened  patient  protections  upon  which we  have  agreed.  Did  they  offer  that? No. They want to go back to the House. It  is an  insult  to  the Senate  to  say: We have a conference, but we are not going to  take  anything  from  the  conference; we  will  disregard  the  Senate;  we  are just  going  to  take  the  House  position. Any  chairman  of  any  committee should  think  about  that:  Yes,  you  are working  on  a  conference; we will  insist we  adopt  the  other  body\u2019s  position,  as if  it  is  superior.  What  about  the  other body\u2019s  position?  What  about  the  Norwood-Dingell  bill?  That  is  bipartisan; people know  it has unbelievable unlimited liability. We  are  criticized  exempt employers. I  yield  myself  an  utes. In  the  Senate  bill,  we  have  liability against  HMOs,  but  we  protect  employers.  Senator  says  that  is  not good enough; we want  to be able  to  sue employers. As  a  former  employer,  if  we  make employers liable for unlimited punitive damages,  class  action  suits,  the  whole works,  we  are  going  to  have  a  lot  of employers  saying:  I  don\u2019t  have  to  provide health care; I will drop it. Employees,  here  is  some  money;  I  hope  you will buy health insurance. Some  employees  will  and,  unfortunately,  a  lot  of  employees  will  not. We will  have  a  dramatic,  draconian  increase in the uninsured. The Norwood-Dingell bill, by CBO estimates\u2014and  I  think  it  is  grossly  underestimated\u2014increases  health  care costs,  one  estimate,  by  4.1  percent;  another  estimate  of  the  Democrat  bill  is over 6 percent. Health care costs are already  going  up  10,  12,  14  percent.  Add another  4  or  6  percent  on  top  of  that. We  are  talking  about  a  16-,  18-percent increase  in  health  care  costs,  and  we will  have  millions  more  join  the  ranks of the uninsured. additional  KENNEDY because  want  minwe  to 4  We  absolutely,  positively  should draw the line and say: Let\u2019s not do anything  that  does  damage  to  the  good health  care  system  we  have.  It  is  not perfect,  but  we  should  not  be  passing legislation that is going to increase the number  of  uninsured. We  should  not  be passing legislation that is going to dramatically  increase  the  cost  and  make it  unaffordable  for  a  lot  of  Americans. We  passed  legislation  in  this  body and  the  House  that  makes  health  care more  affordable.  We  passed  tax  provisions  giving  every  American,  not  just those who work for a large corporation, tax  benefits,  tax  deductions.  That  is positive.  That  is  the  reason  we  called our bill Patients\u2019 Bill of Rights Plus. We  want  to  make  health  care  more affordable  for  all  Americans.  We  want to  increase  the  number  of  insured Americans.  Unfortunately,  the  Kennedy bill,  the Norwood-Dingell bill will do  the  opposite;  it  will  increase  the number  of  uninsured.  We  do  not  want to do that. We want to do the opposite. We  want  to  help  people  get  insurance. The  legislation  before  us  has  no  provision to help  finance health care costs for those people who do not have it. We did  in  our  bill.  We  had  it  in  the  House bill that passed the House. I have one other comment. The President  said  he  would  veto  the  bill  that passed the House and he would veto the bill that passed the Senate. People say: The  President  will  sign  this  bill.  The President  stated  he would  veto  the  bill that  passed  the  House,  and  the  President  said  he  would  veto  the  bill  that passed the Senate. Unfortunately, a lot of  people  are  more  interested  in  politics  and  maybe  political  theater  and seeing  if  they  can  scare  people.  Maybe they  think  that  will  be  to  their  political  advantage.  I  very  much  resent that. I  want  to  pass  a  good,  constructive Patients\u2019  Bill  of  Rights  bill  this  session,  this  year.  The  sooner  the  better. Keep  out  the  politics.  Let\u2019s  see  if  we can pass a bill that has a good external appeals  process;  a  bill  that  does  keep HMOs  accountable.  Let\u2019s  protect  employers.  Let\u2019s  not  do  something  that will  increase  the  number  of  uninsured. Let\u2019s  not  do  something  that  will  damage the system. I am afraid the process our  Democratic  colleagues  are  pulling right now is going to be very disruptive to the conference. I  am  going  to  pledge  we  will  pass  a bill  out  of  conference  this  year,  and  I hope it is one both Houses will pass and the  President  will  sign  that  will  increase  patient  protections  for  all Americans  and  also  keeps  health  care affordable  and  attainable  for  millions of Americans.

Mr.  President,  under the  very  able  leadership  of  Senator we  have  worked  on  this  conference  report  more  than  400  hours with more  intense  effort  than  any  conference  of  which  I  have  ever  been  part. From  time  to  time  many  of  our  colleagues  have  said  to  Senator  The Democrats do not want a bill; they want  a  political  issue.  Why  don\u2019t  we write a bill and pass it with Republican votes? Our  colleague  and  leader,  Senator  has  said:  No,  I  want  to try to do this on a bipartisan basis. I  think  what  Senator  has proven  today  in  a  cynical  political  act is  that  no  good  deed  ever  goes unpunished.  We  are  not  here  today  because  we  are  not  making  progress.  We are  here  today  because  we  are  making too  much  progress.  We  are  here  today because  we  are  on  the  verge  of  writing a bill, but it is a bill that Senator KENis not for. Senator KENNEDY has said: If you will just  let  lawyers  get  into  the  patient treatment room and, if you will just let people  file  lawsuits,  he  will  be  happy. We  want  to  put  the  focus  on  getting health  care,  and  one  gets  that  from doctors and not lawyers. In  an  effort  to  accommodate  and reach  a  bipartisan  compromise,  Senator  proposed  allowing  HMOs to be sued. What does Senator KENNEDY say? It is not enough. Senator KENNEDY does  not  just  want  to  sue  HMOs,  he wants to sue employers. To that we say no,  we  are  not  going  to  sue  employers. Health  insurance  is  provided  on  a  voluntary  basis,  and  we  do  not  want  employers  to  drop  their  health  insurance for their workers. We are worried about millions  of  Americans  losing  their health  insurance.  Senator  is not  worried  about  that;  the  Democrats are  not  worried  about  that  because they have their plan. And  here  it  is.  Do  my  colleagues  remember  this,  the  Clinton  health  care bill?  Do my  colleagues  remember  what they  wanted  to  do?  They  wanted  the Government  to  take  over  and  run  the health  care  system.  Today,  Senator is  very  worried  about  HMOs, but  let  me  read  something  about  how their  health  care  purchasing  collectives would work  in his bill with President Clinton. If  a  patient  went  to  a  doctor  and asked  for  treatment  for  your  sick child,  and  the  doctor  thought  your child  should  have  it,  under  the  Clinton plan  if  the  Government  health  board ruled  no,  the  doctor  could  be  fined $50,000 for providing that health care to your sick child. If  you  said:  My  baby  is  sick,  I  want the  health  care  but  the  Government will  not  pay  for  it,  their  health  care bill  said  if  the  doctor  provided  it  and KENNEDY KENNEDY NICKLES ",

But I know it\u2019s not the right thing to do for Massachusetts  or  California,  so  I wouldn\u2019t  dream  of  asking  them  to shoulder  that  kind  of  mandate  for  our sake  when  we  can  simply,  reasonably, apply it within our borders. As  consumers,  we  should  be  downright  angry  at how  some  of  our  elected officials are responding to our concerns about  the  quality  of  our  health  care and  the  alarming  problem  of  the  uninsured in this country. It  is  being  suggested  that  all  of  our local  needs  will  be  magically  met  by stomping  on  the  good  work  of  the states through the  imposition of an expanded,  unenforceable  federal  bureaucracy.  It  is  being  suggested  that  the American  consumer  would  prefer  to dial  a  1\u2013800\u2013number  to  nowhere  versus calling  their  State  Insurance  Commissioner,  a  real  person  whom  they\u2019re likely  to  see  in  the  grocery  store  after church on Sundays. As  for  the  uninsured  population  in this  country,  carelessly  slapping  down a  massive  new  bureaucracy  on  our states  does  nothing  more  than  squelch their  efforts  to  create  innovative  and flexible  ways  to  get  more  people  insured.  We  should  be  doing  everything we  can  to  encourage  and  support  these efforts  by  states.  We  certainly shouldn\u2019t be throwing up roadblocks. And  how  about  enforcement  of  the minority\u2019s proposal? Well,  almost  one  year  ago  this  body adopted an amendment that stated,  \u2018\u2018It would  be  inappropriate  to  set  federal health  insurance  standards  that  not only duplicate  the  responsibility of  the 50  State  insurance  departments  but that  also  would  have  to  be  enforced  by the Health Care Financing Administration  if  a State  fails  to  enact  the  standard.\u2019\u2019 Yet here we are one year later where, not  only  is  it  being  suggested  that  we trample  the  traditional,  overwhelmingly  appropriate  authority  of  the states  with  a  three-fold  expansion  of the  federal  reach  into  our  nation\u2019s health  care,  they  still  insist  on  having HCFA  be  in  charge.  HCFA,  the  agency that  leaves  patients  screaming,  has doctors  quitting Medicare,  and,  lest we not  forget,  the  agency  in  charge  as  the Medicare  program  plunges  towards bankruptcy. And  guess  what,  it  looks  even  worse for  consumers  under  HCFA\u2019s  \u2018\u2018protection,\u2019\u2019  according  to  a  new  report  released  by  GAO  on  March  31st  of  this year.  The  model  the  Democrats  are supporting  for  implementing  the  Patients  Bill  of  Rights  is  the  Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,  affectionately  known  as  HIPAA.  I quote  from  the  report:  \u2018\u2018Nearly  four years  after  HIPAA\u2019s  enactment,  HCFA continues  to  be  in  the  early  stages  of fully  identifying  were  federal  enforcement  will  be  required.\u2019\u2019  Regarding HCFA\u2019s  role  in  also  enforcing  additional  federal  benefits  mandates  that Congress  has  amended  to  HIPAA,  the GAO  states,  \u2018\u2018HCFA  is  responsible  for directly  enforcing  HIPAA  and  related standards  for  carriers  in  states  that  do not.  In  this  role,  HCFA  must  assume many  of  the  responsibilities  undertaken  by  state  insurance  regulators, such  as  responding  to  consumers\u2019  inquiries  and  complaints,  reviewing  carriers\u2019  policy  forms  and  practices,  and imposing  civil  penalties  on  noncomplying carriers.\u2019\u2019 And then, the GAO report  reveals  that  HCFA  has  finally managed  to  take  a  baby  step:  \u2018\u2018HCFA has  assumed  direct  regulatory  functions,  such  as  policy  reviews,  in  only the  three  states  that  voluntarily  notified  HCFA  of  their  failure  to  pass HIPAA-conforming  legislation  more than 2 years ago.\u2019\u2019 Is  this  supposed  to  give  consumers comfort?  First  we  should  usurp  their local electoral rights or their ability to influence  the  appointment  of  their state  insurance  commissioner and  then offer  up  this  agency  as  an  alternative? I\u2019m  not  sure  I  could  find  a  single Wyomingite to clap me on the back for this kind of public service. I  could  go  on  at  length  about  the very  real dangers of empowering HCFA to  swoop  into  the private market, with its  embarrassing  record  of  patient  protection  and  enforcement  of  quality standards. Such as how it took 10 years for  HCFA  to  implement  a  1987  law  establishing new nursing home  standards intended to improve the quality of care for  some  of  our  most  vulnerable  patients. But I think the case has already been  crystallized  in  the minds  of many constituents: \u2018\u2018enable us to access quality  health  care,  but  don\u2019t  cripple  us  in the process.\u2019\u2019 The  next,  equally  important  issue  is that  of  exposing  employers  to  a  new cause  of  action  under  a  Patients\u2019  Bill of  Rights.  Employers  voluntarily  provide  coverage  for  133  million  people  in this  country.  That  will  no  longer  be the  case  if  we  authorize  lawsuits against  them  for  providing  such  coverage.  This  is  basic  math.  If  you  add 133  million  more  people  to  the  46  million  people  already  uninsured,  I\u2019d  say we  have  a  crisis  on  our  hands.  In  my mind,  a  simpler  decision  doesn\u2019t  exist. We should not be suing employers. Mr.  President.  Let  me  close  by  saying  that  the  conference  has  worked  in incredible  good  faith,  logging  more than  400  hours  and  counting.  We  have come  to  conceptual  agreement  on  a  bipartisan, bicameral basis on more  than half  of  the  common  patient  protections.  We  have  come  to  bipartisan,  bicameral  conceptual  agreement  on  the crown  jewel  of  both  bills\u2014the  independent,  external  medical  review  process.  Most  dramatically,  the  bicameral Republicans have offered a compromise on  liability  and  scope,  to  which  the Democrats  have  given  no  formal,  substantive response,  just rhetoric and political jabs in the press. It is absolutely bad  faith  to  have  done  so.  I  think  it would be  regrettable  if  these continued public  relations  moves  torpedo  what, so  far,  has  produced  almost  everything we  need  for  a  far-reaching,  substantive conference  product.  I  encourage  all  of my  colleagues  to  take  the  high  road and  support  the  legislative  process  our forefathers had in mind, versus a public relations circus. Let  me  share  an  employer  story. Here\u2019s  another  employer  \u2018\u2018real  life\u2019\u2019 story.  Within  the  last  hour,  my  staff was  on  a  conference  call with  the Medical  Director  of  Pitney  Bowes,  a  large employer  that  self-insures  and  self  administers  a  Cadillac-style  health  plan for  more  than  23,000  employees  and  retirees.  All  of  my  colleagues  should take  note  that  this  is  not  just  any  private  citizen.  Dr. Mahoney  was  the  personal physician to President Ford. Now he\u2019s  administering  one  of  numerous health  plans  that  this  amendment threatens to disolve. Everything  from on-site medical centers  to  on-site  fitness  centers  to  the educational  seminars  on  skin  cancer and  stress  management  that  Pitney Bowes  currently  offers  would  be  jeopardized. They\u2019ve said the worst case result  would  be  terminate  the  employer plan  altogether.  That  sentiment  has been  echoed  from  countless  other  employers,  from  IBM  to  caterpillar  to mom-and-pop shops. I  urge  my  colleagues  not  to  crush plans like Pitney Bowes over politics. Mr.  KENNEDY.  I  yield  5  minutes  to the Senator from North Carolina. Mr.  EDWARDS.  Mr.  President,  I thank  all  of my  colleagues  who  are  involved  in  this  conference  and  thank them  for  their hard work and certainly defer  to  all  of  them  about  the  specifics of  what  has  occurred  in  the  conference and the work they have done there. There  are  some  specific  issues  about which  I  am  concerned.  First,  it  is  important  for  the American  people  to understand  that  the  Patients\u2019  Bill  of Rights  means  nothing  unless  those rights  are  enforceable.  Under  any  of these  bills  that  are  being  considered, there are only two enforcement mechanisms.  Without  those  mechanisms working, without  them  being  effective, the  rights  don\u2019t  exist  because  the  insurance  companies  can  do  anything they  want  and  can  never  be  held  responsible for what they do. There  are  two  enforcement  mechanisms.  First,  if  we  have  a  real  and meaningful  independent  appeals  process, that is an enforcement mechanism. Second,  we  do  for  health  insurance companies  the  same  thing  we  do  for every  single American  listening  to  this debate\u2014when  they  hurt  somebody,  we hold them responsible. There  has  been  a  lot  of  argument about  lawyers,  lawsuits,  and  HMOs. Why  in  the world  are HMOs  and  health insurance  companies  entitled  to  be treated any differently than the rest of ",
            "167": "June 8, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) S4807 While  I  appreciate  the  important contributions  of  managed  care,  we must  protect  the  rights  of  patients  in our  nation\u2019s  health  care  system.  Too many  Americans  feel  trapped  in  a  system  which  does  not  put  their  health care  needs  first.  They  believe  that HMOs  value  a  paper  dollar  more  than they  do  a  human  life.  It  is  time  for  us to  finally  help  these  fine  Americans and begin working together to get safe, quality health care for Americans. As my  colleagues  know,  last  summer I  reluctantly  voted  for  the  Senate version  of  the  Patients  Bill  of  Rights. At  that  time  I made  it  known  that my vote  for  passage  was  contingent  on  a strong  conference  agreement  with  a higher  standard  for  protecting  the needs  of  patients  than  those  contained in  the Senate bill.  I  supported  the Senate  bill  because  it  was  important  to move  forward  and  send  legislation  for strengthening  in  conference  with  the House.  It  was  my  strong  hope  that  the House  would  pass  stronger,  more  reasonable  health  care  reform  similar  to the  Norwood/Dingell  legislation  that honestly  puts  the  needs  of  patients first.  Then  we  could  work  together  for a  practical  and  fair  compromise  during conference. Mr.  President,  I  am  voting  today  in support  of  the  proposed  Norwood/Dingell  amendment  before  the  Senate  because  I  share  the  frustration  of  millions  of Americans who  are waiting  for the  conference  to  begin  making  substantial efforts  towards  reaching a viable  agreement  providing  patient  protections. This  conference  has  had more than  four  months  to  work  on  reaching an  agreement  and  yet  they  are  not even  close  to  finding  a  solution.  And  I am concerned that once again, partisan politics and special interests are blocking us from enacting meaningful health care reform for our constituents. It  is  time  for  all  of  us  to  finally  put aside  partisanship  and  the  influence  of special  interests  to  work  together  for what  is  needed  and wanted  by  our  constituents-safe,  quality,  affordable health  care.  This  is  too  important  an issue  to  allow  the  influence  of  special interests  to  prevent  us  from  doing what is right for all Americans. While  I  am  supporting  this  amendment  I would  like  to make  clear  that  I believe  that  there  is  still  work  that must  be  done  in  conference  before  it  is enacted  into  law.  I  support  the  intentions  of  the  Norwood/Dingell  bill  but there  are  areas  that  need  to  be strengthened  and  improved  before  it becomes  law,  including  the  liability provisions.  Real  patient  protection must  permit  individuals  to  resolve  insurance  disputes  through  the  courts but  it  must  also  place  common  sense limits  on  excessive  non-economic  damage  awards  and  ban  punitive  judgements  that  make  health  care  more costly.  This  must  be  structured  in  a manner  that  does  not  encourage  frivolous  law  suits,  unnecessarily  make health  insurance  more  costly  or  make employers  vulnerable  for  health  care decisions they are not making. SenIn  addition,  I  do  not  support  extending  U.S.  Customs  Service  user  fees  to pay  for  this  proposal.  Before  agreeing to  this  amendment  I  was  assured  that the  extension  of  the  user  fees  was merely a  tactical move  to help prevent this  amendment  from  being  defeated by  partisan  parliamentary  procedures. I have been assured  that  if  this amendment  were  to  pass  that  an  alternate means  of  paying  for  it\u2014one  that  does not  undermine  Customs  operations  or constrain  international  commerce\u2014 would  be  incorporated.  It  is  important that  US  Customs  continue  having  adequate  funding  for conducting their programs  including  implementing  a  new automation  system  for  reducing  backlogs  at  ports  of  entry  to  help  facilitate the  dramatic  expansion  of  commerce that  has  helped  fuel  our  strong  economy.  Let  me  reiterate  in  no  way  does my  vote  for  strong  patient  protections in  any way  provide  an  endorsement  for extending  user  fees  and  placing  a  further  burden  on  businesses  and  our economy. It  is  my  strong  hope  that  today\u2019s vote  will  provide  the  impetus  for  the conference  to  finally  work  together  on finding  a  viable  and  real  solution  for providing  Americans  with  the  health care protections they deserve. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Oklahoma. Mr.  NICKLES.  Mr.  President,  I  yield to the Senator from Texas 30 seconds. Mr.  GRAMM.  Mr.  President,  in  1992 and  1993,  when  Senator  and the  Democrats  were  trying  to  raise taxes,  which,  unfortunately,  they  succeeded  in  doing,  and  when  they  were trying  to  have  the  Government  take over  the  health  care  system,  which, thank  God,  they  failed  to  do,  I  said people  would  lose  their  jobs  if  they were  successful.  And  they  did.  Democrats  lost  their  jobs.  Not  one  Republican  was  defeated  as  an  incumbent  in 1994.  We  won  nine  seats  in  the  Senate. And we are in the majority. Some  people  did  lose  their  jobs,  because Americans did not want the Government  to  take  over  and  run  the health  care  system.  I  say  to  Senator that,  as  sad  as  I  know  it makes  him,  they  still  don\u2019t,  and  they never will. Mr.  KENNEDY.  Mr.  I  ask  the  Senator  a  time? Does that stethoscope show any beating  hearts  over  there  on  that  side  of the aisle? Mr.  GRAMM.  Mr.  President,  might  respond  on  Senator  time, talking slowly as I do, this stethoscope picks up a strong heartbeat that believes  in  freedom,  and  that  believes in  the  right  of  consumers\u2014even  health care  consumers\u2014to  fire an HMO  rather than  call  in  a  lawyer  or  a  bureaucrat. That is what we call freedom. That is what we are for. We  disagree,  and  democracy work. Mr.  KENNEDY.  I  thank  the  Senator. Mr. NICKLES.  I ask  the Senator: Did he  conclude  his  remarks?  I  am  getting ready to move to table. President,  could question  on  my KENNEDY\u2019s KENNEDY KENNEDY makes what  that  is  if  I how SenCOLLINS President,  FRIST,  GREGG,  GRAMM,  HUTCHINSON, JEFFORDS Mr.  KENNEDY.  I  am  prepared  to yield  whatever  time  is  going  to  be yielded.  I  am  prepared  to  yield.  If  Senators reserve some time to speak, I will reserve time. Mr.  NICKLES.  Mr.  much time remains? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator has approximately 1 minute. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank Senators  ENZI,  and  for  serving on  this conference committee, and also Senator  who  worked  with  us on  the  task  force.  I  also  very much  appreciate  the  work  they  have  done today on the floor. If we don\u2019t table the Kennedy amendment,  there  will  be  millions  of  people who  will  be  without  health  insurance. That is because it will dramatically increase  the  price  of  health  care.  There are  results  from  actions.  If  we  act  to open  up  all  health  care  plans  and  all employers  to  unlimited  liability  with punitive  damages  and  class  action  lawsuits, we are going to have a lot of people dropping health care plans. Those are just the facts. The  GAO  says  there  is  going  to  be  a 4,  5,  or  6-percent  increase  on  top  of  the 10  or  12  percent  that  is  already  occurring.  A  lot  of  people  can\u2019t  afford  it. They  will  drop  their  health  care\u2014plus the  fact  that  the  Norwood-Dingell  bill, and the Kennedy bill they are trying to pass  right  now,  have  unlimited  punitive damages. I  have  letters  from  Ford,  Wal-Mart, from  IBM,  big  companies  with  some  of the  best  health  care  plans  in  America, saying  they  will  cut  benefits  or  reduce the benefits to  individuals, maybe even drop  coverage,  if  we  pass  that  bill.  We shouldn\u2019t  do  it. We  shouldn\u2019t  do  things that  will  cause  harm.  We  should  not pass  legislation  that  will  increase costs.  We  should  not  pass  legislation that  will  increase  the  number  of  uninsured  by  2,  3,  or  4 million. That will  be a serious mistake. We  should  give  the  legislative  process a chance  to work.  It  is not working by saying we will pass the House bill. I move  to  table  the  Kennedy-Daschle amendment,  and  I  ask  for  the yeas  and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.

Mr. President, Senator COLLINS and  I would  like  to  honor  all  104  Prudential Spirit of Community Honorees by reading their names in the RECORD. The ten students selected as National Honorees are: Linda  Arnade,  17,  of  Palm  Bay,  Florida,  who  discovered  that  septic  tanks in  her  community  were  causing groundwater  contamination  after  testing more than 400 residential wells. She then  launched  an  education  and  monitoring  program  to  alert  the  public  of this important health and environment risk. Brett  Byrd,  13,  of  Camas,  Washington,  who  helped  raise  more  than $100,000  in  his  mother\u2019s  memory  for breast cancer prevention by performing concerts  along  with  his  brother  and their rock band. Megan  Doherty,  16,  of  Lemont,  Illinois,  who  raised  more  than  $56,000  to bring  29  young  cancer  victims  of  the 1986  Chernobyl  nuclear  disaster  to  her town for life-saving medical treatment. Marcus  Houston,  18  of  Denver,  Colorado,  who  developed  an  educational program  called  \u2018\u2018Just  Say  Know\u2019\u2019  that teaches  middle  level  students  what  it takes  to  achieve  academic,  social  and athletic success in high school. Andrew  Leary,  17,  of  Vernon,  New Jersey,  who  led  a  two-and-a-half  year effort  to  establish  the  first  permanent soup  kitchen  in  the  northern  part  of his  rural  county.  He  also  helped  raise $35,000 to operate the facility. Joshua  Marcus,  13,  of  Boca  Raton, Florida,  who  created  \u2018\u2018Sack  It  To You,\u2019\u2019  a  non-profit  corporation  that has  provided  backpacks  filled  with school  supplies  to  more  than  2,500 needy children. Jarrett  Mynear,  11,  of  Nicholasville, Kentucky, who raised more than $18,000 to  distribute  new  toys  each  week  to young patients at a children\u2019s hospital. Since  the  program  started,  Jarrett  has been  featured  on many  local  television shows,  as  well  as  the  nationally  syndicated  \u2018\u2018Rosie  O\u2019Donnell  Show,\u2019\u2019  to promote his cause. Shelarese  Ruffin,  17,  of  Atlanta, Georgia, who developed an intervention program  that  enables  middle  and  high school  students  to  confront  and  overcome  drug  abuse  and  other  discipline problems  instead  of  being  expelled from school. Danielle Shimotakahara, 13, of North Bend, Oregon, who waged a high-profile campaign  to  remove  violent  coin-operated  games  from  places  where  children congregate  in  her  town.  She  also  testified at a U.S. Senate hearing on the effects of violent games on children.

The service,  operated  completely  by  8-to-12 year-olds,  has  served  more  than  3,200 people  in  her  community  and  also  provides  toiletries  and  school  supplies  for needy  children  who  come  to  the  kitchen.

Re: Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000 Hon. DANIEL Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. MOYNIHAN, PATRICK DEAR SENATOR MOYNIHAN:  Congratulations on  your  leadership  in  developing  and  introducing  the  \u2018\u2018Broadband  Internet  Access  Act of  2000.\u2019\u2019  I  am  writing  to  provide  you  with Bell  Atlantic\u2019s  support  and  views  regarding this important tax legislation. As  you  know,  Bell  Atlantic  is  a  leader  in the deployment of broadband capability, particularly  in  the  state  of  New  York.  As  such, we  are  extremely  familiar  with  the  regulatory  and  financial  hurdles  associated  with deploying  broadband  to  all  our  business  and residential  customers.  We  believe  that  rapid deployment  of  this  capability  will  provide the  basis  for  sustained  long-run  economic growth  in  the  economy.  Our  experience  with the  Internet  has  taught  us  that  the  convergence  of  communications  and  computing yields  tremendous  benefits  for  the  economy in terms of productivity growth. Unfortunately,  other  carriers  and  we  face tremendous  government  hurdles  as  we  roll out  this  capability. These hurdles  arise  from the  unintended  adverse  effects  of  regulation on  investment  that,  in  turn,  increase  the degree of  financial uncertainty associated with such  investments.  In  other  words,  we  face  a regulatory  problem  and  a  financial  problem in  deploying  broadband  capability  to  our customers.  The  Broadband  Internet  Access Act helps  to overcome  these problems by encouraging  Bell  Atlantic  and  other  carriers through  financial  incentives  to  proceed  with these  investments.  More  importantly,  the targeted nature of the incentives will help us reach  customers  in  rural  areas  and  low-income  areas  that  are  otherwise  difficult  to serve because of  the high cost of deployment and other factors. The bill does not address the overwhelming regulatory  issues,  which  Bell  Atlantic  continues  to  face.  We  encourage  you  to  support legislation  to  address  these  problems  as well as  the  financial  issues  that  are  addressed  in the Broadband Act. We  encourage  you  to  enact  the  Broadband Internet Access Act  this year. We appreciate your leadership on this important issue. Sincerely, THOMAS J. TAUKE, Senior Vice President\u2014 Government Relations. NTCA, Arlington, VA, June 5, 2000. Re Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000. Hon. DANIEL Ranking  Minority  Member,  Senate  on Finance, Washington, DC. MOYNIHAN, PATRICK Committee DEAR SENATOR MOYNIHAN:  During  the course of the past year, the term  \u2018\u2018digital divide\u2019\u2019  has  quickly  become  the  buzzword  of choice  among  policymakers.  Coined  ostensibly  to  describe  the  absence  of  communications  availability  to  certain  segments  of  the nation\u2019s population, the term has been twisted  to  imply  the  issue  of  communications \u2018\u2018haves\u2019\u2019  and  \u2018\u2018have-nots\u2019\u2019  is  merely  a  rural vs. urban matter. NTCA has vigorously moved to redirect the discussion  to  fully  recognize  the  achievements  of  small  rural  incumbent  local  exchange  carriers  (ILECs)  in  deploying  advanced  communications  infrastructure  and services.  The  facts  bear  witness  to  the  success  of  small  rural  ILECs  in  stepping  up  to what we  feel  is  better  described  as  the  \u2018\u2018Digital Challenge.\u2019\u2019 Recent surveys show that  in many  cases, markets  served  by  such  entities are  more  technologically  advanced  than their  larger,  urban  counterparts.  Likewise, they  are  significantly  more  advanced  than the  rural  markets  served  by  the  nation\u2019s large  ILECs.  Other  reports  show  that  urban areas  in  general  are  not  the  \u2018\u2018digital Mecca\u2019\u2019 many  would  have  us  believe.  The  reality  is that  the markets  of  the  nation\u2019s  small  rural ILECs  are  anything  but  communications technology  wastelands  as  many  are  portraying them to be. Nevertheless,  there  remains  a  substantial amount  of  costly  work  to  be  done  for  all markets  to  be  fully  advanced  service-capable.  For  this  reason,  we  commend  your  effort, vis-a-vis  the Broadband  Internet Access Act  of  2000,  to  further  stimulate  deployment of broadband services by granting tax credits to  telecommunications  providers  deploying advanced  technologies. Furthermore, we  sincerely  appreciate  your  effort  to  recognize the special circumstances, with regard to tax credits,  of  the  nation\u2019s  rural  telecommunications  cooperatives  by  the  inclusion  of  the Special Rule for Mutual or Cooperative Telephone Companies. In addition, there are several existing tools such  as  the  universal  service  support  program  that,  if  allowed  to  function  appropriately,  could  help  offset  the  tremendous costs  associated  with  the  deployment  of  advanced  services.  We  continue  to  work  with several of your colleagues to advance legislation  that  will  ensure  the  universal  service program  is  allowed  to  function  as  the  Congress  envisioned  in  helping  lead  the  deployment  of  new  communications  technologies and services. It  must  be  reiterated  that  small  rural ILECs  have  long  led  the  way  in  meeting  the Digitial  Challenge  by  deploying  new  technologies\u2014not  just  to  their  most  profitable customers,  but  to  every  individual  within their  market  that  wishes  to  receive  service. With  your  assistance,  the  rural  ILEC  industry  will  continue  to  maintain  its  unparalleled record of service. Sincerely, SHIRLEY BLOOMFIELD, Vice President, Government Affairs & Association Services. BRISTOL HEALTH BAY AREA CORPORATION, Fion  DEAR DANIEL SENATOR MOYNIHAN, MOYNIHAN:  Dillingham, AK, May 31, 2000. Re Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000. Hon. PATRICK Ranking  Minority  Member,  Committee  nance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. We  are  writing to  indicate  our  support  for  your  continued effort  to  pass  the Broadband  Internet Access Act  of  2000.  If  passed,  this  legislation  could significantly  improve  access  of  millions  of Americans  to  the  Internet  and  its  valuable resources,  including  residents  of  rural  Alaska communities. We  provide  health  care  services  to  34  remote  Alaska  communities,  most  of  which can  only  be  reached  by  small  airplane.  The availability  of  affordable  advanced  telecommunications  including  telemedicine  and improved  Internet access would be beneficial in  providing  health  education  to  villagers; would  help  reduce  feelings  of  isolation  of health  care  providers,  teachers  and  other professionals;  and  provide  access  to  health care  resources  for  everyone.  It  would  also provide  faster  and  less  expensive  access  to all communication mediums. We believe that remote, rural areas such as those  that  make  up  a  large  part  of  Alaska need  and  deserve  the  availability  of  affordable  high-speed  Internet  services  like  urban communities  currently  enjoy.  Without  this availability,  rural  communities  will  continue  to  be  left  behind  and  technologically outdated  as  the  rest  of  the  U.S.  moves  forward. Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  this  important  legislation.  Please contact me at  (907) 842\u20135201  if  I can be of  further assistance. Sincerely, ROBERT J. CLARK, President/CEO. GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, Fion  DEAR DANIEL SENATOR MOYNIHAN, MOYNIHAN:  May 25, 2000. Re Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000. Hon. PATRICK Ranking  Minority  Member,  Committee  nance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. We  are  writing to  encourage  you  in  your  effort  to  pass  the Broadband  Internet  Access  Act  of  2000.  If passed,  this  important  legislation  could  significantly  improve  the  way  millions  of Americans gain access to health  information and receive health care. For  many  years  the  Imaging  Sciences  and Information  Systems  (ISIS)  Center  at Georgetown University has been a  successful innovator  of  technologies  that  are  used  to improve  the  quality  and  lower  the  cost  of health  care.  This  contribution,  however,  accounts  for  only  two-thirds  of  the  receipt  for successful  health  care  reform  in  America. The  third  element,  improved  access  to health  services,  has  been  one  of  the  most challenging,  especially  to  health  care  providers and consumers in rural America. Access  to  quality  health  care  cannot  be improved  through  development  of  more  efficient  technologies,  alone.  We,  and  with  us many of our colleagues  throughout America, believe  financial  incentives  are  necessary  to correct  current  regulatory  and  market insufficiencies  that  inhibit  assess  to  emerging  health  services  that  increasingly  rely  on telecommunications  and  Internet connectivity  to  reach  consumers.  The  creation  of  these  incentives  is  outside  the  purview  of  the health  sector  and  that  is why we look to you and your Senate colleagues. You can  help  remedy  the  economic  conditions that  contribute  to  the  growing  \u2018\u2018digital  divide\u2019\u2019,  that made  second  class  citizens  out  of underserved people throughout the country. Specifically,  we  look  to  you  for  a  remedy that  will  improve  access  and  availability  of telephone,  cable,  fiber  optic,  terrestrial, wireless,  and  satellite  telecommunications services at bandwidth capacities sufficient to carry  high  resolution  images,  video  and voice over the Internet, increasingly the preferred mode of delivery. We believe your proposed  legislation  addressed  these  problems through  its  10%  tax  credit  for  deployment  of \u2018\u2018last-mile\u2019\u2019  current  generation  broadband capability  to  rural  and  underserved  areas, and  its  20%  credit  for  \u2018\u2018next  generation\u2019\u2019 service. Therefore  we  applaud  your  sponsorship  of the  Broadband  Internet  Access  Act  of  2000. We  appreciate  your  vision  and  look  to  you and  your  colleagues  in  the Senate  to  rapidly pass  this  important  legislation  so  that  we can  move  on  to  a  next  generation  of  health care  with  improved  quality,  cost  and  access. Thank  you  for  an  opportunity  to  express our  support  for  your  initiative.

A  bill  to  provide  additional authority  to  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  to  protect,  enhance,  and  restore fish  and  wildlife  habitat  on  the  Missouri  River  and  to  improve  the  environmental  quality  and  public  use  and appreciation  of  the  Missouri  River;  to the  Committee  on  Environment  and Public Works. THE MISSOURI IMPROVEMENT RIVER VALLEY ACT BROWNBACK DASCHLE,  JOHNSON,  ROBERTS,  \u2022 Mr.  KERREY.  Mr.  President,  one year  ago  I  came  to  the  floor  of  the United  States  Senate  to  introduce  legislation  designed  to  improve  the  environmental  quality  and  public  use  and appreciation of the Missouri River. The Missouri  River  Valley  Improvement Act of 1999, sought to also mark the upcoming bicentennial anniversary of the Lewis  and  Clark  expeditions  of  this great  river.  At  that  time  I  asked  my colleagues  who  represent  the  states and  communities  along  the  Missouri River  to  look  closely  at  the  bill  and join me as  cosponsors  in  support of  the legislation. Through  the  hard  work  of  state  officials,  river  organizations  and  citizens throughout  the  Missouri  River  basin, many  important  improvements  have been  made  to  this  bill.  I  believe  these improvements  strengthens  our  commitment  to  protecting  the  Missouri River. I am pleased, therefore, to introduce  today,  along  with  my  Colleague\u2019s Senator  Senator  BOND,  Senator  Senator  and Senator  the  Missouri  River Valley Improvement Act of 2000. This  legislation  maintains  the  commitment made  in  last year\u2019s bill  to aid native  river  fish  and  wildlife,  reduce flood  loss,  and  enhance  recreation  and tourism  throughout  the  basin.  Additionally,  this  bill  provides  authorities for  the  revitalization  of  historic riverfronts,  similar  to  the  ongoing \u2018Back  to  the  River\u2019  revitalization project  currently  underway  in  my home state of Nebraska. The new legislation  also  recognizes  the  commitment Congress made last year to habitat restoration  efforts  along  the  Missouri River  by  authorizing  resources  for these projects. I  am  proud  of  the  bipartisan  support garnered  for  this  legislation.  This  bill demonstrates  that  common  ground  exists  when  it  comes  to  strengthening the health of the Missouri River. Those who use the river whether it be for recreational,  commercial,  or  environmental  purposes  recognize  the  benefits of  preserving  this  National  treasure. Protecting  native  habitat  along  the Missouri  River  and  enhancing  environmental  understanding  through  riverfront  restoration  and  scientific  monitoring is a legacy we should all want to leave our children and grandchildren. Mr. President, it is my hope that this bill  becomes  part  of  the  growing  recognition  that  the  environmental  revitalization  of  the  Missouri  River  is  in all of our  interests. The Missouri River Valley  Improvement  Act  of  2000  will help  to  restore  and  improve  our  access and  enjoyment  of  the  river,  and  will provide  vital  economic,  recreational and  education  opportunities  for  everyone  who  lives  along  and  visits  this great  river,  the  Crown  Jewel  of  the Midwest.

A  bill  to  provide  for  the training  of  individuals,  during  a  Presidential  transition,  who  the  President intends  to  appoint  to  certain  key  positions,  to provide  for a  study and  report on  improving  the  financial  disclosure process  for  certain  Presidential  nominees,  and  for  other  purposes;  to  the Committee on Governmental Affairs. THE PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION ACT OF 2000 LEVIN,  DURBIN,  LIEBERMAN AKAKA,  VOINOVICH.  \u2022 Mr.  ator  ducing  of  2000  ators  THOMPSON.  Mr.  President,  Senand  I  are  today  introthe  Presidential  Transition  Act on  behalf  of  ourselves  and  Senand The  ability  of  a  Presidentelect  to  effectively  transition  from campaigning  to  governing  is  obviously of  critical  importance  and  this  legislation  is  designed  to  initiate much  needed improvements in the process. A President-elect must  face the management  challenge  of  transitioning from  leading a  successful  campaign operation  to  leading  the  nation.  There are  only  73  days  from  election  day  to inauguration  day.  Transition  planning should  begin  prior  to  election  day. The President-elect  should  have  the  ability to  move  immediately  to  put  a  new team  in  place.  That  team  should  receive  the  critical  information  it  needs to  be  prepared  to  take  over  the  management  of  the  federal  government  on inauguration  day.  Potential  nominees should  be  able  to  move  through  the nomination  and  confirmation  process without unnecessary barriers. The  magnitude  of  the  need  for  an  effective  presidential  transition  and  the recognized  problems  with  past  ones have  led  a number  of  private  sector  organizations  to  focus  on  the  problem and  solutions  to  it.  Several,  including the  Presidential  Appointee  Initiative of  the  Brookings  Institution,  Transition  to  Governing  of  the  American  Enterprise  Institute  and  Brookings,  and the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Mandate  for Leadership  2000,  have  contributed  to our  consideration  of  this  problem. These  groups  and  others  are  independently  preparing  a  body  of  knowledge which  will  assist  the  new  administration  to  get  an  effective,  timely  start.  I ask  unanimous  consent  that  an  article by  Carl  Cannon  in  National  Journal and  one  by  David  Broder  in  the  Washington Post, which describe the significant work which  is underway, be printed  at  the  conclusion  of  my  remarks, followed  by  the  text  of  our  legislation. The  legislation  encompasses  and  expands  on  H.R.  3137,  legislation  sponsored  by  Representative  Chairman of the Committee on Government  Reform  Subcommittee  on  Government Management, Information and Technology and passed by  the House of Representatives.

(9)  The  reports  by  both  the  Naval  Court  of Inquiry and  the Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation were kept secret, and Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short were denied  their  requests  to  defend  themselves through trial by court-martial. (10)  The  joint  committee  of  Congress  that was established to investigate the conduct of Admiral  Kimmel  and  Lieutenant  General Short  completed,  on  May  31,  1946,  a  1,075page  report  which  included  the  conclusions of  the  committee  that  the  two  officers  had not been guilty of dereliction of duty. (11) The then Chief of Naval Personnel, Admiral  J.  L.  Holloway,  Jr.,  on  April  27,  1954, recommended  that  Admiral  Kimmel  be  advanced in rank in accordance with the provisions of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. (12) On November 13, 1991, a majority of the members  of  the  Board  for  the  Correction  of Military  Records  of  the  Department  of  the Army  found  that  Lieutenant  General  Short \u2018\u2018was  unjustly  held  responsible  for  the  Pearl Harbor  disaster\u2019\u2019  and  that  \u2018\u2018it would  be  equitable  and  just\u2019\u2019  to  advance  him  to  the  rank of lieutenant general on the retired list. (13) In October 1994, the then Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Carlisle Trost, withdrew his  1988  recommendation  against  the  advancement  of  Admiral  Kimmel  and  recommended  that  the  case  of  Admiral  Kimmel be reopened. (14) Although  the Dorn Report,  a  report  on the results of a Department of Defense study that was  issued on December 15, 1995, did not provide  support  for  an  advancement  of  Rear Admiral  Kimmel  or  Major  General  Short  in grade,  it  did  set  forth  as  a  conclusion  of  the study  that  \u2018\u2018responsibility  for  the Pearl Harbor  disaster  should  not  fall  solely  on  the shoulders  of  Admiral  Kimmel  and  Lieutenant  General  Short,  it  should  be  broadly shared\u2019\u2019. (15)  The  Dorn  Report  found  that  \u2018\u2018Army and  Navy  officials  in Washington  were  privy to  intercepted  Japanese  diplomatic  communications . . . which  provided  crucial  confirmation  of  the  imminence  of  war\u2019\u2019;  that \u2018\u2018the  evidence  of  the  handling  of  these  messages in Washington reveals some ineptitude, some  unwarranted  assumptions  and misestimations,  limited  coordination,  ambiguous  language,  and  lack  of  clarification and followup at higher levels\u2019\u2019; and, that \u2018\u2018together,  these  characteristics  resulted  in  failure . . . to  appreciate  fully  and  to  convey  to the commanders in Hawaii the sense of focus and  urgency  that  these  intercepts  should have engendered\u2019\u2019. (16) On July 21, 1997, Vice Admiral David C. Richardson  (United  States  Navy,  retired)  responded  to  the  Dorn  Report  with  his  own study  which  confirmed  findings  of  the  Naval Court  of  Inquiry  and  the Army Pearl Harbor Board  of  Investigation  and  established, among other facts, that the war effort in 1941 was  undermined  by  a  restrictive  intelligence distribution  policy,  and  the  degree  to  which the  commanders  of  the  United  States  forces in  Hawaii  were  not  alerted  about  the  impending  attack  on  Hawaii  was  directly  attributable  to  the  withholding  of  intelligence from  Admiral  Kimmel  and  Lieutenant  General Short. (17)  The  Officer  Personnel  Act  of  1947,  in establishing  a  promotion  system  for  the Navy  and  the  Army,  provided  a  legal  basis for  the  President  to  honor  any  officer  of  the Armed  Forces  of  the  United  States  who served  his  country  as  a  senior  commander during  World  War  II  with  a  placement  of that  officer,  with  the  advice  and  consent  of the Senate, on the retired  list with the highest  grade  held  while  on  the  active  duty  list. (18)  Rear  Admiral  Kimmel  and  Major  General  Short  are  the  only  two  eligible  officers from  World  War  II  who  were  excluded  from the  list  of  retired  officers  presented  for  advancement  on  the  retired  lists  to  their  highest wartime ranks under the terms of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. (19)  This  singular  exclusion  from  advancement  on  the  retired  list  serves  only  to  perpetuate  the  myth  that  the  senior  commanders  in  Hawaii  were  derelict  in  their duty  and  responsible  for  the  success  of  the attack  on Pearl Harbor,  a  distinct  and unacceptable  expression  of  dishonor  toward  two of  the  finest  officers  who  have  served  in  the Armed Forces of the United States. (20)  Major  General  Walter  Short  died  on September  23,  1949,  and  Rear  Admiral  Husband  Kimmel  died  on  May  14,  1968,  without the  honor  of  having  been  returned  to  their wartime  ranks  as  were  their  fellow  veterans of World War II. (21)  The  Veterans  of  Foreign  Wars,  the Pearl  Harbor  Survivors  Association,  the  Admiral  Nimitz  Foundation,  the  Naval  Academy  Alumni  Association,  the  Retired  Officers Association,  and  the Pearl Harbor  Commemorative  Committee,  and  other  associations  and  numerous  retired  military  officers have  called  for  the  rehabilitation  of  the  reputations  and  honor  of  Admiral  Kimmel  and Lieutenant  General  Short  through  their posthumous advancement on the retired lists to their highest wartime grades. (b)  ADVANCEMENT OF REAR ADMIRAL AND MAJOR GENERAL SHORT ON RETIRED KIMMEL LISTS.\u2014(1) The President is requested\u2014 (A)  to  advance  the  late  Rear  Admiral  Husband  E.  Kimmel  to  the  grade  of  admiral  on the retired list of the Navy; and (B) to advance the late Major General Walter  C.  Short  to  the  grade  of  lieutenant  general on the retired list of the Army. (2)  Any  advancement  in  grade  on  a  retired list  requested  under  paragraph  (1)  shall  not increase  or  change  the  compensation  or  benefits  from  the  United  States  to  which  any person  is  now  or  may  in  the  future  be  entitled  based  upon  the  military  service  of  the officer advanced. (c)  SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE PROFESSIONAL PERFORMANCE OF ADMIRAL KIMMEL AND LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHORT.\u2014It is the sense of Congress that\u2014 (1)  the  late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel  performed  his  duties  as  Commander  in Chief,  United  States  Pacific  Fleet,  competently  and  professionally,  and,  therefore, the  losses  incurred  by  the  United  States  in the  attacks  on  the  naval  base  at  Pearl  Harbor,  Hawaii,  and  other  targets  on  the  island of  Oahu,  Hawaii,  on  December  7,  1941,  were not a result of dereliction in the performance of those duties by the then Admiral Kimmel; and (2)  the  late Major  General Walter  C.  Short performed  his  duties  as  Commanding  General, Hawaiian Department, competently and professionally,  and,  therefore,  the  losses  incurred  by  the  United  States  in  the  attacks on  Hickam  Army  Air  Field  and  Schofield Barracks,  Hawaii,  and  other  targets  on  the island  of  Oahu,  Hawaii,  on  December  7,  1941, were  not  a  result  of  dereliction  in  the  performance  of  those  duties  by  the  then  Lieutenant General Short. (AND  BIDEN  ROTH)  AMENDMENT NO.  3234 Mr.  LEVIN  (for  Mr.  (for  himself and Mr. ROTH)) proposed an amendBIDEN to  the  bill,  S.  2549,  supra;  as  folment  lows: On  page  378,  between  sert the following: lines  19  and  20,  inSEC. 1027. REPORT ON SPARE PARTS AND REPAIR PARTS PROGRAM OF THE AIR FORCE FOR THE C\u20135 AIRCRAFT. folthe  makes  (a)  FINDINGS.\u2014Congress  lowing findings: (1)  There  exists  a  significant  shortfall  in the Nation\u2019s current strategic airlift requirement,  even  though  strategic  airlift  remains critical  to  the  national  security  strategy  of the United States. (2)  This  shortfall  results  from  the  slow phase-out  C\u2013141  aircraft  and  their  replacement with C\u201317  aircraft  and  from  lower  than optimal  reliability  rates  for  the C\u20135 aircraft. (3) One  of  the  primary  causes  of  these  reliability  rates  for  C\u20135  aircraft,  and  especially for  operational  unit  aircraft,  is  the  shortage of  spare  repair  parts.  Over  the  past  5  years, this  shortage  has  been  particularly  evident in the C\u20135 fleet. (4) NMCS  (Not Mission Capable  for Supply) rates  for  C\u20135  aircraft  have  increased  significantly in the period between 1997 and 1999. At Dover  Air  Force  Base,  Delaware,  an  average of 7 through 9 C\u20135 aircraft were not available during that period because of a lack of parts. (5)  Average  rates  of  cannibalization  of  C\u20135 aircraft  per  100  sorties  of  such  aircraft  have also  increased  during  that  period  and  are well above the Air Mobility Command standard.  In  any  given  month,  this  means  devoting  additional  manhours  to  cannibalizations of  C\u20135  aircraft.  At  Dover  Air  Force  Base,  an average  of  800  to  1,000  additional  manhours were required  for cannibalizations of C\u20135 aircraft  during  that  period.  Cannibalizations are  often  required  for  aircraft  that  transit through a base such as Dover Air Force Base, as well as those that are based there. (6)  High  cannibalization  rates  indicate  a significant  problem  in  delivering  spare  parts in  a  timely  manner  and  systemic  problems within  the  repair  and  maintenance  process, and  also  demoralize  overworked  maintenance crews. (7)  The  C\u20135  aircraft  remains  an  absolutely critical  asset  in  air  mobility  and  airlifting heavy equipment and personnel to both military  contingencies  and  humanitarian  relief efforts around the world. (8)  Despite  increased  funding  for  spare  and repair  parts  and  other  efforts  by  the  Air Force  to  mitigate  the  parts  shortage  problem, Congress continues to receive reports of significant  cannibalizations  to  airworthy  C\u2013 5 aircraft and parts backlogs. (b)  REPORTS.\u2014Not  later  than  January  1, 2001, and September 30, 2001, the Secretary of the  Air  Force  shall  submit  to  the  congressional  defense  committees  a  report  on  the overall  status  of  the  spare  and  repair  parts program of the Air Force for the C\u20135 aircraft. The report shall include the following\u2014 (1)  a  statement  the  funds  currently  allocated  to  parts  for  the  C\u20135  aircraft  and  the adequacy  of  such  funds  to  meet  current  and future  parts  and  maintenance  requirements for that aircraft; (2)  a  description  of  current  efforts  to  address shortfalls  in parts  for such aircraft,  including  an  assessment  of  potential  shortterm and long-term effects of such efforts; (3)  an  assessment  of  the  effects  of  such shortfalls  on  readiness  and  reliability  ratings for C\u20135 aircraft; (4)  a  description  of  cannibalization  rates for C\u20135 aircraft and the manhours devoted to cannibalizations of such aircraft; and (5)  an  assessment  of  the  effects  of  parts shortfalls  and  cannibalizations  with  respect to C\u20135 aircraft on readiness and retention.

Ms.  COLLINS.  Mr.  President,  I  rise  today  in  support  of  the  Collins-Reed  amendment  to  the  Labor  HHS  Appropriations  bill  which  will  increase  the  availability  of  funds  to  provide  substance abuse treatment services for our  Nation\u2019s homeless men and women.  I  would  like  to  extend  my  thanks  to  Senator JACK who has  joined as a  cosponsor  of  this  amendment  and  who  has made increased funding for services  REED CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE June 30, 2000  JEFto benefit the homeless one of his highest  priorities.  I  would  also  like  to  extend  my  thanks  to  Senators  DOMENICI,  FEINSTEIN,  MIKULSKI,  SARBANES,  FORDS,  KENNEDY,  BINGAMAN,  WELLSTONE,  LINCOLN CHAFEE,  LEAHY,  DURBIN,  SNOWE,  EDWARDS MOYNIHAN,  DODD,  and  all  of  whom  cosigned  a  letter  to  appropriators  which  I  and  Senator REED sent earlier this year calling  for  an  increase  in  funding  for  mental  health  and  substance  abuse  treatment  for the homeless.  Like  all  Americans,  homeless  men  and  women  need  decent  shelter,  but  in  many  cases,  homeless  people  also  need  treatment  to  address  the  underlying  problem  which  has  kept  them  on  the  street.  An  estimated  25  percent  to  40  percent  of  homeless  people  need  programs  to  help  them  recover  from  drug  and alcohol abuse illnesses. Despite the  prevalence of these illnesses among our  nation\u2019s  homeless,  very  limited  funds  are  available  to  serve  their  specific  treatment needs.  For  a  variety  of  reasons,  addicted  homeless  people  often  have  difficulty  accessing  mainstream  treatment  services.  For  example,  many  substance  abuse  service  providers  are  not  equipped  to  handle  the  complex  social  and  health  issues  that  homeless  persons  present,  and  may  reject  them  or  provide  ineffective  care.  In  addition,  the  reality  of  life  on  the  street  may  significantly  complicate  the  receipt  of  effective  treatment.  For  example,  homeless  men  and  women  may  have  difficulty  in  adhering  to  treatment  schedules  or  may  lack  transportation  to and from outpatient services.  Comprehensive  programs  which  link  treatment  to other health, housing, social  and  maintenance  services  often  provide  the  best  opportunity  for  the  homeless  to  adhere  to  treatment  programs  and ultimately  achieve  stability  in  their  lives. The  funding addressed  in  my  amendment  will  provide  grants  which  will  assist  communities  in  providing  treatment  services  tailored  to  best serve the needs of their own homeless population.  I  thank  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee,  who  has  been  tireless  in  his  efforts to increase substance abuse treatment  services  for  all  Americans  in  need,  and  who  has  been  so  receptive  to  this  amendment  and  the  needs  of  our  Nation\u2019s homeless men and women.

Ms.  COLLINS.  Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased that the managers have accepted  the  amendment  that  I  introduced  with  my  colleague  from  Wisconsin.  I  thank  the  distinguished  Chairman  and  Ranking Member of the Labor-HHS Appropriations  Subcommittee  for  their  assistance  and  support.  Our  amendment will improve access to automated  external  defibrillators,  or  AEDs,  in  rural  areas,  where  they  are  sorely  needed  to  increase  the  chance  that  individuals  in  these  communities  who  suffer  cardiac  arrest will  survive. Joining us  in  cosponsoring  this amendment  are  Senators  ENZI,  JEFFORDS,  BIDEN,  MURRAY, ABRAHAM, WELLSTONE, BINGAMAN, ROBB, KERRY and REED.  Heart  disease  is  the  leading  cause  of  death  both  in  the  State  of  Maine  and  the  United  States.  According  to  the  American  Heart  Association,  an  estimated  250,000  Americans  die  each  year  from  cardiac  arrest.  Many  of  these  deaths could be prevented if automated  external  defibrillators  were  more  accessible.  AEDs  are  computerized  devices  that  can  shock  a  heart  back  into  normal  rhythm  and  restore  life  to  a  cardiac arrest victim. They must, however,  be  used  promptly.  For  every  minute  that  passes  before  a  victim\u2019s  normal heart rhythm is restored, his or  her chance of  survival  falls by as much  as 10 percent.  According to the American Heart Association,  making  AEDs  standard  equipment  in  police  cars,  fire  trucks,  ambulances  and  other  emergency  vehicles  and  getting  these  devices  into  more  public  places  could  save  more  than  50,000  lives  a  year.  Cities  across  America  have  begun  to  recognize  the  value  of  fast  access  to  AEDs  and  are  making  them  available  to  emergency  responders.  In  many  small  rural  communities, however, limited budgets and  the fact that so many rely on volunteer  organizations  for  emergency  services  can  make  acquisition  and  appropriate  training  in  the  use  of  these  life-saving  devices  problematic.  Our  amendment  will  increase  access  to  AEDs  and  trained  local  responders  for  smaller  towns  and  rural  areas  in  Maine  and  elsewhere  where  those  first  on  the  scene may  not  be  paramedics  or  others  who would normally have AEDs.  I  am  pleased  to  be  joined  by  my  colleague from Wisconsin who has led this  effort  to  increase  access  to  AEDs  in  rural areas.  Mr.  FEINGOLD.  Thank  you.  I  would  like  to  commend  my  friend  and  colleague from Maine for her leadership in  passing  this  amendment  that  will  help  improve  cardiac  arrest  survival  rates  across  rural  America  by  making  AEDs  more accessible.

Mr.  President,  I  thank  my  colleagues  Senator  and  Senator  for  including  an  amendment  I  have  offered  to  increase  funding  for  the  Office  of  Civil  Rights  (OCR)  at  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS)  as  part  of  the  managers\u2019  package.  My  amendment  would  provide  an  increase  of  $2.5  million  for  the  Office  of  Civil  Rights  to  protect  the  civil  rights  of  Americans. I want to take a moment to  explain  why  I  believe  this  funding  increase is so important.  The Office of Civil Rights at HHS has  the  responsibility  to  enforce  civil  rights  laws  in  the  health  and  human  service  setting  throughout  the  United  States.  What  does  this  mean?  Essentially,  the  Office  of  Civil  Rights  oversees  anyone  who  receives  funding  from  HHS\u2014hospitals,  managed  care  organizations,  nursing  homes,  and  social  service  agencies  among  others\u2014to  ensure  they  are  complying  with  civil  rights  statutes.  Although  it  enforces  a  wide  array  of  civil  right  laws,  the  bulk  of OCR\u2019s  efforts  center  around  enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act  of  1964,  which  addresses  discrimination  in  federally  funded  programs,  and  the  Americans with Disabilities Act.  The  civil  rights  challenges  that  confront  OCR  continue  to  grow.  A  few  of  the  issues  the  office  is  focusing  on  include  racial  and  ethnic  disparities  in  health;  ensuring  that  individuals  with  disabilities  avoid  unnecessary  institutionalization and can live in their communities;  and  fighting  discrimination  among  minorities  and  individuals  with  disabilities in managed care.  It  seems  to  me  that  this  office  already  has  a  pretty  big  workload.  Well,  it  is  about  to  become  much  larger.  In  addition  to  the  important  efforts  the  OCR  currently  works  on,  this  office  will  soon  be  responsible  for  implementing  and  enforcing  the  proposed  medical  privacy  regulations.  The  administration  has  been  required  to  establish  safeguards  to  protect  personal  medical  information  of  Americans  because this Congress missed its own self-  imposed  deadline.  If we\u2019re  not  going  to  do  our  job  in  Congress,  we  should  at  least  support  the  Office  that  will  have  to do it for us.  In  1996,  Congress  passed  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA).  This  legislation  set  a  self-imposed  deadline  for  Congress  to  pass  comprehensive  medical  privacy  legislation  by  August  1999.  If  Congress  was  unable  to meet  the  deadline,  the  Secretary  of  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  was  required  by  law  to  establish medical  privacy  protection  through  regulation.  Secretary  Shalala  issued  her  draft  regulations last fall and there was a public  comment  period  that  extended  until  this  past  February.  Currently,  HHS  is  working  to  finalize  the  draft  regulations  which  should  be  issued  later  this  year.  I  have  been  on  this  Senate  floor  countless  times  to  talk  about  the  need  to  establish  privacy  protections  for  personal  medical  information.  It  angers  me  that  this  Congress  could  not  even move privacy protections  through  the committee process, let alone, to actually  have  a  debate  on  this  critical  issue  before  the  full  Senate.  We  couldn\u2019t  do  the  job  on  our  own  and  we  have  instead  shifted  the  responsibility  to  the  administration.  This  Congress  has  the  responsibility  to  protect  the  privacy  of  Americans\u2014and  that  includes  the  protection  of  their  medical  records. The place for these protections  is  in  legislation\u2014not  regulation.  But  that\u2019s  not  the  issue  right  now.  The  issue  before  us  is  the  need  to  adequately  fund  the  office  that  will  have  the  sole  responsibility  for  enforcing  these essential privacy protections.  The  FY  2000  Budget  for  the  Office  of  Civil  Rights  is  $22  million.  This  figure  has  remained  unchanged  since  1980.  I  find this hard to believe. The Office has  seen  its  enforcement  responsibilities  increase  dramatically with  the  passage  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  and  other  major  legislation.  Add  the  impending  implementation  of  the medical  records  privacy  regulation  and  it  becomes  clear  that  this  budget  must  come  in  line  with  the  current  times  and  allow  the  Office  to  do  what  they  must\u2014protect the civil rights of Americans.  This  additional  funding  provided  in  this  amendment  will  help  the  Office  of  Civil  Rights  do  the  job  we  have  asked  them to do. I do not think this increase  is  nearly  enough.  However,  I  recognize  that  we  have  limited  funds  for  a  wide  range  of  important  programs.  I  am  hopeful  that  this  will  be  the  first  of  many  steps  to  increase  the  resources  for  this  office.  Again,  I  want  to  thank  my  colleagues  for  their  support  of  this  amendment and for their support of the  important work of this office.\u2211  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President,  I  rise  to  support  the  increase  in  funding  for  the  Office  of  Civil  Rights  at  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services.  The  Office  of  Civil  Rights  (OCR)  enforces  civil  rights  laws  in  health  and  human  services  settings.  OCR  oversees  hospitals,  managed  care  organizations,  nursing  homes,  social  service  agencies\u2014literally  any  state,  local,  or  private agency that receives HHS funding,  to  ensure  compliance  with  civil  rights  laws.  In  the next year, OCR will be  responsible for enforcing several initiatives of  real  importance  to  me  and  to  health  care  consumers  across  America.

Mr.  SPECTER.  Mr.  President,  parliamentary  inquiry.  Are  we  now  ready  for third reading?  Mr.  GRAMM.  Mr.  my point of order.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  Senator  from  Texas  raises  his  point  of  order. The point of order is sustained.  President,  I  renew  TRAINING NEEDS FOR APPROPRIATE SECLUSION AND RESTRAINT  USE OF  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will  the Chairman  of  the  Labor  Health  and  Human  Services  Appropriations  Subcommittee  yield for a question?  Mr.  SPECTER.  I  will  be  pleased  to  yield  for  a  question  from  the  Senator  from Connecticut.  Mr.  LIEBERMAN.  First,  I  want  to  compliment  the  chairman  and  the  ranking member, Mr. HARKIN for bringing  this  bill  to  the  Senate  in  a  very  timely way and for the committee\u2019s attention  to  the  several  health  programs  funded  by  this  Bill  that  very  broadly  benefit the entire Nation.  I  also want  to  compliment  the  chairman  and  the  ranking  member  for  the  committee\u2019s  report  language  from  last  year  that  urged  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  to  address  the  inappropriate  use  of  seclusion  and  restraint  in  mental  health  facilities  across  the  Nation  that  has  resulted  in  tragic  and  unnecessary  deaths  and  injuries.  The  committee\u2019s  language  has  helped  focus  attention  on  this  matter  and progress has been made. For example,  the  Health  Care  Financing  Administration  (HCFA)  has  issued  interim  \u2018\u2018conditions  of  participation\u2019\u2019  rules  governing  the  use  of  restraints  and  seclusion  in  facilities  receiving Medicare  and  Medicaid  reimbursement.  I  thank  the  committee  for  its  assistance  in  making progress on this matter.  Mr.  President,  what  we  have  learned  from  the National Mental Health Association,  the  Child  Welfare  League,  and  my own states Klingberg Center is that  a  significant  obstacle  to  making  further  progress  is  the  high  turnover  rate  in many of  the mental health  facilities  across  the  country  and  the  recurring  need  to  provide  training  to  new  personnel  in  these  facilities  on  the  appropriate  use  of  seclusion  and  restraint.  To  address  this  national  problem,  would  the  Chairman  support  funding  a  demonstration  project  for model  training  and  education  programs  for  the  appropriate use of restraints?  Mr. SPECTER. I thank both Senators  and  for  their  work  in  bringing  this  matter  to  our  attention  and  I  would  certainly  support  such  a  demonstration.  Mr.  LIEBERMAN.  I  thank  the  Chairman  for  his  continuing  leadership  on  this matter.  Mr. DODD. I would like to also thank  the Chairman and the Ranking Member  for  their assistance on  this  issue which  has  been  of  particular  concern  in  my  state.  In  fact,  I  worked  to  develop  legLIEBERMAN DODD LIEBERMAN,  islation  last  year,  S.  976,  the  Compassionate  Care  Act,  cosponsored  by  Senator  that  recognizes  the  critical  need  for  adequate  training  in  restraint  use  and  alternatives  to  their  use.  The  Compassionate  Care  Act  was  passed  by  the  Senate  unanimously  last  year  as  part  of  the  reauthorization  of  the  Substance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health  Services  Administration  (SAMHSA)  legislation  and  it  is  my  hope that the House of Representatives  will soon act on this  important  legislation.  Meanwhile,  however,  it  would  appear  to  me  that  there  are  nationally  based  consumer  organizations  that  could  make an important contribution to the  development  of  model  training  and  education  programs  that  could  effectively serve to  lessen the  inappropriate  use of restraint and seclusion.  Mr.  SPECTER.  Yes.  It  seems  to  me  that  such  groups  would  be  strong  competitors  for  an  education  and  training  demonstration grant.  MEDICARE CONTRACTOR FUNDING  Mr. CRAIG. I am concerned about the  funding  level  for Medicare  contractors.  The  Senate  committee  mark  reduces  the FY 2001 funding level by $57 million  below  the  President\u2019s  Budget  recommendation.  I  believe  that  this  funding  reduction  will  adversely  impact  fee-for-service  claims  processing  activities  and  the  ability  of  contractors  to  provide  critical  beneficiary  and  providers services.  In  the  recent  past,  we  have  seen  the  effect  inadequate  funding  levels  can  have on services. In 1998 payments were  slowed down, and beneficiaries and providers  were  forced  to  deal  with  more  voice  mail  rather  than  human  beings  when  they  called  their  contractors  with  questions  about  claims.  We  need  to  fund  this  program  adequately  to  ensure  beneficiaries  get  the  service  they  deserve.  Mr.  DORGAN.  I  want  to  make  it  clear  that  funding  to assure  the  timely  and  accurate  processing  of  Medicare  claims  also  is  a  high  priority  for  me  and the beneficiaries in my state.  I am concerned that HCFA projects a  3.5  percent  increase  in  claims  volume  next  year  and  yet  our  budget  flatlined  funding  for Medicare contractors. However,  I  am  even  more  concerned  that  the  House  has  cut  the  Medicare  contractor budget by  $79 million  from current  levels.  The  Senate,  at  the  very  least,  must  assure  that  this  important  program  is  not  cut.  Additionally,  I  would  like  to work with Senator CRAIG  to  secure  additional  funding  for  the  Medicare  contractors,  if  funds  become  available.  Mr.  SPECTER.  I  understand  the  issues  both  Senators  are  raising  and  the  importance  of  adequately  funding  the  Medicare  contractor  program.  I  will  work  with  my  two  colleagues  to  try  to  keep  the  Senate  funding  level  is  kept  intact  and  that  no  funding  cut  is  made  to  the  Medicare  contractor  program.  HCFA COVERAGE CHANGE  Mr.  HOLLINGS. Mr.  President,  I  rise  today to discuss an issue of importance  to  the  people  of  South  Carolina  with  my  colleagues  from  Pennsylvania  and  Iowa.  In  January  of  1999,  South  Carolina  enhanced  its Medicaid drug program  to  provide  eligible  adults  with  four  prescriptions  a  month  instead  of  three.  This  was  a  much  needed  change  that  HCFA  had  encouraged  South  Carolina  to make over a number of years. Unfortunately,  South  Carolina  improperly  notified  HCFA  of  the  coverage  change.  Instead  of  filing  a  State  Plan  amendment,  South  Carolina  distributed  a  Medicaid Bulletin  to  relevant  parties\u2014  including  three  officials  at  HCFA\u2019s  Atlanta  regional  office,  believing  that  to  be  sufficient.  The  South  Carolina  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  brought  their  oversight  to HCFA\u2019s  attention.  South  Carolina  and  HCFA  are  currently  involved  in  discussions  regarding  whether  South  Carolina  should receive federal funds for 4th prescription  expenditures  that  occurred  between January  1, 1999 and September  30, 1999.  At  this  time,  a  legislative  remedy  does  not  appear  necessary  to  allow  HCFA  to  impose  suitable  fines  on  states  that  provide  notice  of  Medicaid  coverage  changes  but  do  not  properly  file  State  Plan  amendments.  I  am  encouraged  by  the  response  officials  in  South  Carolina  have  received  from  HCFA  and  hopeful  that  a  resolution  can  be  reached  in  a  manner  agreeable  to all parties. Nevertheless, I wanted to  bring  this  matter  to  the  attention  of  the  distinguished  chairman  and  ranking  member  of  the  subcommittee  and  inform  them  that  I  may  revisit  this  issue at a later date if necessary.  Mr.  SPECTER.  I  thank my  colleague  from  South  Carolina  for  bringing  this  matter  to  my  attention.  I  too  hope  that  South  Carolina  and  HCFA  can  resolve  their  difference,  but  would  be  willing  to  discuss  the matter  in  the  future  if  an  agreement  cannot  be  reached.  Mr.  HARKIN.  I  agree  ments of the chairman.  Mr.  HOLLINGS.  I  thank  the  distinguished  chairman  and  ranking member  of  the  subcommittee  for  their  attention  to  this matter  and will keep  them  appraised of future developments.  with  comthe  MEDICARE INTEGRITY PROGRAM  Mr.  HARKIN.  I  am  very  concerned  about  the  proposed  $50  million  funding  cut  to  the Medicare  Integrity  Program  (MIP)  approved  by  the  House  Appropriations  LHHS  Subcommittee.  The  Senate  has  recommended  that  MIP  be  funded  at  $680  million,  the  amount  authorized in HIPAA.  In  1999,  Medicare  contractors  saved  the  Medicare  Trust  Funds  nearly  $10  billion  in  inappropriate  payments\u2014  about $18 for every dollar invested. Any  funding  cut  to  MIP  is  tantamount  to  the  government  throwing  money  out  a  window.  In  fact,  I  believe,  because  of  the  tremendous  need  to  reduce  an  estimated $14 billion in Medicare waste, we  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:41 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S30JN0.REC S30JN0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",
            "28": "S6212  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE June 30, 2000  was  conducted  late  in  1996  which  indicated  a  need  for  additional  hygienists  to  fill  current  and  future  vacancies.  The  lack  of  a  dental  hygienist  in  a  practice  reduces  the  number  of  hours  the  dentist  is  available  to  deliver  care  only  he  or  she  is  able  to  perform.  Licensure  as  a  registered  dental  hygienist  in  Montana  requires  graduation  from  an  accredited  dental  hygiene  program  of  either  two  or  four  years. Montana\u2019s  only  dental  hygiene  education  program  was  closed  in  1989  at  Carroll  College. Since that time efforts to open  a  new  program  have  been  unsuccessful,  but  are  ongoing.  Montana  students  desiring  hygiene  degrees  must  travel  out  of  State.  Of  the  current  28  students  at  Sheridan  Community  College  in  Wyoming,  half  are  from Montana. Montana  has  fewer  dentists  per  capita  than  the  U.S. average. Many communities, especially  rural  areas,  are  losing  dentists  (to  retirements  and  other  factors).  A  large  percentage  of  Montana  dentists  are  expected  to  retire  in  the  coming  decade,  while  the  number  of  available  dental  school  graduates  has  been  declining.  With  two-thirds  of  Montana\u2019s  active  dentists  age  45  years  or  older  and  more  than  a  quarter  over  age  55,  concerns  over  the  effect  of  retirement  in  coming  years  has  grown.  If  a  dental  hygiene  program  were  established  in  Montana,  hygiene  graduates  would  be  available  to  perform  hygiene  tasks  which presently are being performed by  dentists.  This  would  free  the  dentists  to  perform  diagnosis  and  treatment  services  which  only  the  dentist  is  trained  to  provide.  The  establishment  of  this  program  would  be  of  vital  importance  to  eliminating  the  strong  prevalence  of  under-served  areas  in  Montana.  Mr.  SPECTER.  We  have  rural  states  in  need  of  programs  which  improve  both  access  and  quality  of  care.  I  believe  these  projects  are  worthy,  and  I  will  consider  them  during  the  conference  agreement.  I  appreciate  your  bringing these issues of my attention.  Mr.  HARKIN.  I  understand  the  nature  of  the  problem  in  Montana  requires  attention.  I  thank  the  Senator  for  bringing  these  issues  to  my  attention. Chairman SPECTER and  I will give  them consideration during conference.  LEAP FUNDING  to  rise  HARKIN  SPECTER SPECTER Mr.  REED.  Mr.  President,  I  engage  Senators  and  in  a  colloquy  regarding  funding  for  the  Leveraging  Educational  Assistance  Partnership (LEAP) program.  First,  I  want  to  commend  Senators  and HARKIN for numerous education  funding  increases  in  the  Labor,  Health  and  Human  Services,  and  Education  Appropriations  bill.  There  are  tough budget pressures  facing Senators  and  and  they  have  done  tremendous  work  on  this  bill.  In  particular, I am pleased that they have  increased  funding  for  the  Leveraging  Educational  Assistance  Partnership  (LEAP) program to $70 million.  LEAP,  a  federal-state  partnership,  is  vital  to  our  efforts  to  help  needy  stuHARKIN,  SPECTER COLLINS dents  attend  and  graduate  from  college.  In  fact,  without  this  important  federal  incentive,  many  states  would  never  have  established  or  maintained  their  need-based  financial  aid  programs.  Over  the  past  three  years,  I  have  worked  with  Senator  and  others  in  the  Senate  to  restore,  revamp,  and  increase  funding  for  LEAP.  This  year,  the  Senate  Labor,  Health  and  Human Services, and Education Appropriations  bill  provides  $70  million  for  LEAP.  While  this  funding  level  is  less  than  the  bipartisan  request  that  I  submitted with  32 of my colleagues,  it  is a  significant  increase  over  current  funding  and  the  President\u2019s  request.  This  would  be  the  biggest  boost  for  the  program  in  some  time,  and,  as  such,  I  decided not to offer an amendment to further increase funding for LEAP.  However,  I  am  concerned  that  during  Conference  with  the  House,  which  has  once  again  zero-funded  the  program,  LEAP  will  not  remain  at  the  Senate\u2019s  $70  million  funding  level.  This  concern  is  also  shared  by  the  higher  education  community,  which  strongly  supports  the  Senate\u2019s  $70  million  for  LEAP.  Would  the  Chairman  yield  for  a  question?  Mr.  SPECTER.  I  would  yield  Senator from Rhode Island.  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator. Does  the  Senator  share  my  concern  about  maintaining  the  Senate\u2019s  $70  million  for LEAP and is the Senator\u2019s intent to  fight for this level in Conference?  Mr.  SPECTER.  I  share  the  Senator\u2019s  support  for  our  Subcommittee\u2019s  funding  level  for  LEAP  and  will  work  during Conference to preserve it.  Mr.  HARKIN.  I  would  also  like  to  voice  my  support  for  preserving  the  Subcommittee\u2019s  funding  level  for  LEAP.  Mr.  REED.

Mr.  President,  the Chairman yield for a question?  Mr.  SPECTER.  I  will  be  pleased  yield.  Mr.  BINGAMAN.  First,  I  want  to  compliment  the  Chairman  and  the  Ranking  Member  of  the  Subcommittee  on  their  hard  work  in  producing  this  bill for the consideration of the Senate.  I  would  also  compliment  the  Committee  for  addressing  the  medical  errors  issue.  Medical  errors  account  for  as  many  as  98,000  deaths  each  year  making  it  the  5th  leading  cause  of  death in America. It is therefore appropriate  that  the  Committee  has  recommended  an  allocation  of  $50  million  to  the  Agency  for  Healthcare  Research  and  Quality  (AHRQ)  to  focus  on  ways  to reduce medical errors.  Mr. REID. Mr.  President,  I  also want  to  express  my  support  for  the  efforts  outlined  in  this  bill  to  reduce  medical  errors.  It  is  my  hope  that  these  measures  will  set  us  on  the  path  of  constructively  addressing  this  troubling  issue.  KIN the  ChairSPECTER Mr.  BINGAMAN.  In  hearings  before  the  Health,  Education,  Labor  and  Pensions Committee we heard expert testimony  regarding  the  contribution  to  increased  safety  made  by  human  factors  research  in  industries  such  as  defense  and  aviation.  This  field  of  research  maximizes  the  efficiency  and  accuracy  of  the  interface  of  humans  with  equipment,  technology  and  the  workplace  environment.  Does  the  Chairman  view  human  factors  as  a  field  of  research  that  could  make  an  important  contribution  toward reducing medical errors?  Mr.  SPECTER.  I  thank  the  Senator  from New Mexico and the Senator from  Nevada  for  highlighting  this  matter.  Yes,  the  field  of  human  factors  research  clearly  is  a  field  that  can make  an  important  contribution  toward  reducing medical  errors.  I  am  also  aware  that  the National Academy of Sciences  has  developed  an  expertise  in  this  field  and  I  would  urge  the  Agency  for  Healthcare  Research  and  Quality  to  call  on  the  expertise  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  as  it  addresses  the medical errors issue.  Mr.  BINGAMAN.  I  thank  man for his response.  Mr.  KENNEDY.  Mr.  President,  I  know  that  Senators  and  HARworked  diligently  to  craft  a  bill  that could gain broad support. But during the floor debate, Republicans weakened  this  bill  in  critical  ways  that  shortchange  children  in  their  education,  subject  hundreds  of  thousands  of  American  workers  to  ergonomic  injuries,  and  promote  a  sham  patients\u2019  bill of rights.  I  urge  the  Senate  to  reject  this  bill,  and  I urge  the President  to veto  it  if  it  reaches  his  desk.  America\u2019s  schoolchildren,  workers,  seniors,  and  everyone  with  health  needs  deserve  a  much  better bill.  Republicans\u2019  very  first  order  of  business  in  debating  this  bill  was  to  delay  the  Department  of  Labor\u2019s  proposed  protections against ergonomic injuries.  Hundreds  of  thousands  of  American  workers  will  continue  to  suffer  these  injuries if this bill is enacted. The companies  that  Republicans  are  helping  in  this  bill  have  had  years  to  study  and  respond  to  the  overwhelming  evidence  that  ergonomic  standards  improve  worker  safety.  Yet  these  special  interests  continue  to  oppose  these  protections.  This  is  unacceptable,  and  it  alone warrants a veto of this bill.  Debate  on  many  other  parts  of  this  bill  fell  into  a  regrettable  pattern.  Time and again Democrats came to the  floor  with  proposals  to  improve  schools,  improve  health  care,  or  improve  conditions  in  the  workplace.  Republicans rejected the amendments, because  the  amendments  didn\u2019t  allow  room  for  the  massive  tax  breaks  they  want,  and  the  amendments  were  defeated.  Republicans  think  they\u2019ve  already  done  enough  for  the  health  and  education  of  the  American  people.

Given  the  drastic  and  over-reaching  changes  which  would  be  brought  about  by  the  Daschle  amendment,  especially  in  a  new  area  such  as  genetic  testing,  consideration  of  this  legislation  must  be deliberate and well-informed.  Yet, there has not been a single hearing  on  this  legislation.  In  fact,  the  amendment language was not available  for  review  until  only  an  hour  or  so  before  the  vote.  I  believe  it  would  be  wrong and even negligent to pass  legislation  without  knowing  exactly  how  it  would  affect Americans\u2019  lives,  now  and  far into the future.  The Senate Health, Education, Labor  and  Pensions  Committee  has  already  planned  the  first  hearing  on  this  matter  in  July.  I  am  confident,  that  with  careful  deliberation  and  thorough  debate,  we  will  succeed  in  finding  the  most  effective  and  appropriate  way  to  ensure  that  no  one  will  have  their  genetic-information  used  against  them.  I  am looking forward to the challenge.  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the  Senate  passed  H.R.  4577,  the  Labor-  HHS-Education  Appropriations  Act.  I  would  like  to  congratulate  my  colleagues,  Senator  Senator  and  Senator  for  working  together  to  pass  one  of  the  more  contentious  of  the  annual  appropriations bills.  I  appreciate  the  comity  and  courtesy  displayed  by  the  managers  of  this  bill.  I  realize  that  most  of  my  colleagues  have  specific  priorities  they  wish  to  highlight  in  this  measure.  I  appreciate  the  managers\u2019  support  of  the  Inhofe  amendment  regarding  the  Impact  Aid  program.  As  I  have  stated  in  the  past,  this is a vital program for Utah.  I  also  appreciate  the  fact  that  the  subcommittee  has  once  again  included  a  provision  which  would  allow  school  districts  adversely  affected  by  a  recalculation  of  the  census  to  keep  their  Title I concentration funds.  According  to  Utahns  who  live  and  work and  educate our  children  in  these  districts,  this  cut  would  do  a  huge  disservice  to Title  I  students  in  these  districts. These  hardworking Utahns  have  informed me that they believe that the  census  calculations  do  not  adequately  reflect  the  pockets  of  poverty  that  exist  in  these  districts.  Some  of  the  schools  in  these  districts  have  a  poverty  rate,  when  calculated  based  on  school  lunch  data,  at  over  70  percent.  I  am  pleased  that  the  subcommittee  has  accepted  the  recommendation  to  hold  these districts harmless.  I intend to vote in favor of the Labor-  HHS-Education  Appropriations  bill,  but  I  would  be  remiss  if  I  did  not  take  this  opportunity  to  note,  once  again,  that  a  crucial  provision  in  the  Title  I  formula  remains  unfunded.  The  Education  Finance  Incentive  Grant  Program  was  authorized  in  the  1994  Elementary  and  Secondary  Education  Act  and  is  included  in S.  2,  the ESEA  reauthorization,  currently  pending  before  the Congress.  I  recently  detailed  the merits  of  this  program when  I  spoke  about my  intention to offer an amendment to S. 2 that  would make EFIG a mandatory component  of  Title  I.  I  will  briefly  review  those arguments here:  EFIG  has,  as  a  principal  component,  an  equity  factor,  which  measures  how  states  distribute  resources  among  school  districts.  As  policy,  equalizing  resources  among  school  districts  has  merit well documented in academic literature.  Moreover,  many  States  are  being  compelled  by  the  courts  to  equalize  resources among  school districts. Over  30  states  have  been  taken  to  court  on  the  basis  of  an  unequal  distribution  of  resources.  My  amendment  would  provide  some relief to states that are currently  required  by  the  courts  to  equalize  resources  among  school  districts  by  increasing  their  share  of  Title  I  funds.  My  amendment  would  also  provide  the  incentive  to  equalize  resources  to  states  which  may  not  have  already  done so.  The  Education  Finance  Incentive  Grant  program  would  be  the  only  part  of the Title I formula that does not use  the per-pupil expenditure as a proxy for  a  state\u2019s  commitment  to  education.  There  are  many  ways  to  measure  a  State\u2019s  commitment  to  education\u2014the  per-pupil expenditure is merely one. Indeed, one of the most damaging aspects  of  the  Title  I  formula  is  that  it  is  replicated  as  a  means  to  distribute  Federal  money  to  the  states  in  other  programs  that  have  no  relation  to  Title  I.  The  insertion  of  another  measure  of  a  state\u2019s commitment to education is appropriate.  When  EFIG  is  a  factor  in  the  Title  I  formula,  more  states  do  better  than  under  current  law.  This  was  a  key  factor  in  the  debate  over  the  1994  reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary  Education  Act  and  why  it  was  the  intent  during  the  enactment  of  the  1994  reauthorization  that  any  additional  funds  directed  to  Title  I  go  out  through  the  EFIG.  Indeed,  it  was  the  reason why a number of Senators voted  for  the  conference  report.  It  is  my  strongly  held  conviction  that  the  intention  of  the  1994  act  should  be  realized,  and  I will  continue  to  pursue  this  goal.  I  do  not  believe  that  the  Senate  should  authorize  on  an  appropriations  measure,  which  is  why  I  did  not  offer  my amendment during consideration of  this  bill.  However,  I  join  with  many  of  my  colleagues who have  expressed  concerns  over  the  possibility  that,  for  the  first  time  in  nearly  30  years,  the  Congress  will  fail  to  reauthorize  vital  elementary  and  secondary  education  programs.  I  sincerely  hope  that  those who  have  obstructed  enactment  of  S.  2  will  reconsider  their  position  and  allow  the  bill to go forward.\u2211  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Under  the  previous  order,  the  Senator  from  New Mexico is recognized to speak as if  in morning business.  The Senator from New Mexico.  HAPPY  FORESTS  Mr.  DOMENICI.  Mr.  President,  I  want  to  speak  for  a  few minutes  about  a pending national disaster.  Mr.  President,  I  want  to  discuss  something  that  is  unfortunately  not  part  of  this  fire  package.  For  over  a  month,  I  have  been  working  intensely  with  other  Members  and  the  Clinton  Administration  trying  to  begin  to  address  a  serious  problem  that  in  the  West  has  been  highlighted  in  stark  terms  by  the  events  that  happened  to  the  community  of  Los  Alamos  in  my  state,  as  just  one  example.  What  happened  to  the homes and  families of Los  Alamos  is  unfortunately  going  to  happen again unless we, as a Congress, can  convince the Clinton Administration to  join  us  in  bold  and  deliberate  actions.  Throughout  the  United  States  there  is  an  increasing  amount  of  land  in  what  natural  resource  scientists  and  firefighting  experts  call  the  \u2018\u2018wildland/  urban  interface.\u2019\u2019  With  more  people  moving  into  the West, and more homes  being  built  in  communities  surrounded  by  federal  lands,  neighborhoods  like  those  that  burned  in  Los  Alamos  are  becoming more numerous.  At  the  same  time,  as  a  consequence  of decades of fire suppression as well as  years  of  increasing  drought, many millions of acres\u2014by the General Accounting  Office\u2019s  estimate,  39  million  or  more  acres\u2014of  national  forests  are  at  high  risk  of  wildfires.  They  are  in  this  situation  because  fuel  loads  have  risen  to  dangerous  levels  and  forest management  has  been  dramatically  curtailed  at  the  same  time.  The  escape  of  the  prescribed  fire  in  Bandelier  National  Monument,  and  its  subsequent  effect  on  the  town  of  Los  Alamos  make  it  clear, as Secretary Babbitt has already  conceded,  that  in  many  places  prescribed fire is not a viable management  tool  to  reduce  fuel  loads.  It  is  particularly risky to use in the wildland/urban  interface  because  of  the  presence  of  homes and families.  Therefore,  joined  by  others  Members  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle,  I  worked  over  the  last  few  weeks  to  provide  the  Administration  with  both  the  resources and the tools to begin an accelerated  program  of  fuel  reduction  in  wildland/urban interface areas for communities  that  are  at  risk  throughout  the  West.  We  suggested  a  number  of  proposals  that  the  Administration  found  too  hot  to  handle.  For  instance,  we  asked whether  the Council  on Environmental  Quality  would  designate  this  an  emergency  situation  and  expedite  NEPA  compliance  for  hazard  fuel  reduction  activities  in  the  wildland/  urban  interface.  The  Administration  representatives  said  no.  They  felt  that  this  would  be  too  controversial  with  national  environmental  special  interest groups. They pleaded with us not to  pursue this option.  We asked whether they could suspend  administrative appeals for these hazard  fuel  reduction  projects.  That  would  eliminate  one  source  of  delay.

            "44": "S6228  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE June 30, 2000  BURNS,  We  have  sought  to  recommend  a  balanced  bill  that  addresses  key, military  construction  requirements  for  readiness,  family  housing,  barracks,  quality  of  life and  funding  for  the  reserve components.  In  the  final  conference agreement  relating to military construction, we met  our  goals  of  protecting  quality  of  life  and  enhancing  mission  readiness  throughout the Department of Defense.  It  provides  a  total  of  $8.8  billion  in  spending,  an  increase  of  $200  million  over  the  levels  recommended  by  both  the  House  and  Senate,  and  an  increase  of  $800  million  over  the  President\u2019s  budget request.  It  is  my  hope  that  we  can  move  this  bill forward very quickly and send it to  the President.  Mr.  STEVENS.  Mr.  President,  late  Thursday,  the  conference  concluded  on  H.R.  4425,  the Fiscal Year  2001 Military  Construction Appropriations Act.  When  the  appropriations  committee  in  the Senate  reported  that  bill, we  included  a  second  division,  Division  B,  that  provided  a  series  of  emergency  supplemental  appropriations  for  the  Department  of  Defense,  the  Coast  Guard,  and  other  national  defense  related activities.  The  conferees  on  this  bill,  led  by  the  subcommittee  chairman,  Senator  addressed  both  the  underlying  military  construction  bill,  and  an  expanded  range  of  emergency  supplementary needs.  Upon  completing  work  on  the  military  construction  portion,  an  amendment  was  offered  by  myself,  Senator  BYRD,  the  House  committee  chairman,  and  the  House  ranking  Member, DAVID OBEY.  The amendment addressed fiscal year  2000  funding  needs  for  the  Department  of  Defense,  the  Coast  Guard,  wildfire  fighting,  recovery  from  hurricanes  Floyd  and  Irene,  the  Cerro  Grande  fire  in  New  Mexico,  Liheap,  and  Plain  Colombia.  At  several  critical  points,  the  personal  involvement  of  the  Speaker  on  the  House  and  the  Majority  Leader  in  the Senate were invaluable to breaking  through  disagreements,  and  achieving  completion of our work.  While Senator BURNS will address the  military  construction  portion  of  the  bill,  I  want  to  highlight  the  defense  emergency needs addressed  in  this conference report.  Once  again,  the  President mortgaged  the  readiness  of  our  Armed  Forces  by  committing  troops abroad, without  the  prior  authorization  and  funding  from  Congress.  If this bill did not pass this week, the  Army  faced  a  genuine  calamity,  as  training,  base  operations  and  other  critical functions would have ground to  a halt.  These  funds,  provided  to  sustain  the  Army  through  the  remainder  of  this  fiscal  year,  will  prevent  any  interruption  or  degradation  of  our  Armed  Forces.  In  addition,  the  conferees,  under  leadership  of  Representative  YOUNG,  JERRY  BILL the  BILL LEWIS,  YOUNG,  HOBSON,  chairman  of  the  House  Defense  Appropriations  Subcommittee,  responded  to  several  vital  defense  needs.  The  amendment,  offered  by  the  four  Members  I  named,  provides  a  total  of  $11.23 billion in emergency spending for  fiscal year 2000.  The  amendment  also  makes  several  technical  changes,  pursuant  to  the  budget  resolution  for  fiscal  year  2001  adopted  earlier  this  year,  concerning  changes  to  pay  days,  delayed  obligations,  progress  payments,  prompt  payment, and other matters.  In  addition,  the  amendment  permits  the  Senate  Appropriations  Committee  to  allocate  the  full  amount  provided  in  the  302(a)  allocation  for  discretionary  spending  in the budget resolution. This  is  the  same  amount  now  available  to  the House Committee.  The  amendment  also  adjusts  the  Function  050  outlay  firewall  included  in  the  budget  resolution  to  reflect  the  actual outlay levels in the Function 050  related  bills  reported  by  the House  and  Senate committees.  I  want  to  especially  commend  the  Chairman  of  the  House  Military  Construction  Subcommittee,  Representative  and  the  Chairman  of  the  House  Committee,  for  their cooperation and leadership in presenting  this  conference  report  to  the  House and Senate.  Critical  funding  shortfalls  for  fuel,  medical  care,  contract  liabilities  for  Tricare,  depot  maintenance  and  intelligence  were  addressed  in  the  House  passed version of the supplemental, and  included in this conference report.  Chairman  initiative  ensured  that  the  readiness  and  quality  of  life  for our military personnel will be truly  enhanced  by  these  initiatives,  and  provide  the  right  starting  point  for  our  work  on  the  conference  for  the FY  2001  Defense  Appropriations  Bill  when  we  return from the July 4th recess.  A  second  important  need  met  in  this  conference  report  is  for  Western  wildfire  fighting. As we meet here  in Washington,  fires  are  burning  in  several  Western  States,  especially  Washington  State and my own State of Alaska.  The $350 million provided in this conference  report  will  ensure  the  Bureau  of  Land  Management  and  the  Forest  Service  will  be  able  to  respond  to  any  challenges  we  face  during  what  promises  to  be  a  dry  and  hot  summer\u2014a  truly dangerous situation.  Last  month,  at  the  request  of  the  senior  Senator  from  New  Mexico,  I  traveled  to  the  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratories  during  the  terrible  fire  that afflicted that area.  I  saw  firsthand  the  devastation  to  that community, and the  federal  facilities, caused by that fire.  Senator  has  included  in  this bill a comprehensive authorization  bill  that  provides  a  claims  settlement  mechanism  for  the  families  and  businesses  who  lost  so  much  in  that  tragedy.  In  addition,  this  conference  report  provides  $661  million  to  initiate  the  DOMENICI LEWIS\u2019  DOMENICI claims  settlement  process  and  restoration of the federal facilities. These provisions  brought  to  the  conference  by  Senator  will  start  the  long  recovery  process,  reflecting  the  Federal Government\u2019s liability for this disaster.  In  this  conference  report,  there  are  also  several  matters  of  great  importance  to  my  State.  I  appreciate  the  willingness of the conferees to consider  these items.  Finally,  I  want  to  again  thank  the  distinguished  Ranking  Member  of  our  Committee, Senator BYRD, for his work  to  complete  work  on  this  bill.  All  the  conferees met and worked  in a spirit of  bipartisan  compromise,  which  is  reflected  in  the  conference  report  before  the Senate.  I  urge  the  Senate  to  adopt  this  conference  report  today,  so  that  it  can  go  immediately to the President.  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate  will  soon  take  up  the  FY  2001  Military  Construction Conference Report.  In addition  to  meeting  the  military  construction needs of the nation, Divisions  B & C contain emergency supplemental  appropriations  for  FY  2000  totaling  some $11.2 billion.  The  supplemental  portion  of  the  bill  funds  a  broad  array  of  urgently  needed  programs.  More  than  $6  billion  is  provided  for  the  emergency  needs  of  the  military.  Of  that  amount,  some  $2  billion  is  to  cover  the  cost  of  our  peacekeeping  operations  in  Kosovo;  $1.6  billion  is  to  recover  increased  fuel  costs  to  the  military;  and  $1.3  billion  is  for  health  benefits  for  the  military.  For  the  victims  of  natural  disasters,  particularly  those  who  suffered  the  ravages of Hurricane Floyd, some $300 million  is  provided.  And,  $350  million  is  provided  in  emergency  funds  to  replenish  the  fire  management  accounts  of  the  Department  of  the  Interior  and  U.S.  Forest  Service.  Those  firefighting  accounts are  totally depleted and must  be  replenished  immediately.  The  bill  also  provides  $600  million  in  Low  Income  Home  Energy  Assistance  grants,  and  more  than  $600  million  is  provided  to  address  the  costs  related  to  the  disastrous  fire  at  Los  Alamos,  New  Mexico.  One  of  the  biggest  pieces  of  the  supplemental  package  is  $1.3  billion  to  fully  fund  the  President\u2019s  request  in  support  of  Plan  Colombia.  The  President\u2019s  anti-drug  initiative  is  an  ambitious  effort  in  support  of  Plan  Colombia,  a  massive  undertaking  by  the  Colombian  government  to  fight  the  alarming  rise  of  heroin  and  cocaine  production  and  trafficking  in  Colombia.  The  intent  of  the  President\u2019s  aid  package  to  Colombia  is  laudable;  but  at  this  point,  there  remain  more  questions  than  answers  as  to  what  the  impact  of  this  assistance  will  be.  Our  efforts  in  the  past  have  done  little,  if  anything,  to  deter  Colombia\u2019s  drug  lords.  The  production  of  cocaine  and  heroin has  skyrocketed. Some analysts  are  concerned  that  increased  U.S.  involvement in Colombia\u2019s drug wars will  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:41 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S30JN0.REC S30JN0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",
            "52": "S6236  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE June 30, 2000  Pastrana  received  attention  as  the  House  and  Senate  have  considered  the  Administration\u2019s  plan.  In  that  regard,  the conference report before the Senate  today  includes  several  stringent  requirements, including a series of conditions  on  the  progress  of  Colombia\u2019s  military  in  addressing  human  rights  abuses;  $29  million  more  than  the  President\u2019s  request  for  human  rights  and  justice  programs;  a  requirement  that  the U.S.  President  develop  a  comprehensive  strategy  with  benchmarks;  and  additional  anti-drug  funding  to  neighboring  nations  so  that  this  problem  is  not  simply  exported  out  of  Colombia.  Although  there  remain  numerous  critics  who  do  not  support  this  plan,  I  would attest that the provisions in this  bill  are  far  better  than  simply  appropriating  the  funds  without  condition.  With  these  strong  provisions  included,  I  support  passage  of  this  anti-drug  package for Colombia.  However,  let\u2019s  be  clear  that  passage  of  this  plan  today  is  not  the  end  of  Congress\u2019  consideration  of  this  critical  issue.  As  chairman  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Western  Hemisphere  Affairs,  I  will  closely  monitor  implementation  of  this  aid  package  to  ensure  that  the  conditions  enacted  by  Congress  today  are  carried  out  responsibly  and  thoroughly  by  the Administration.  I  would  also  like  to  mention  a  rider  inserted  by  the  Conference  Committee  that would prohibit  the Environmental  Protection Agency  from  finishing work  on  a  proposed  rule  revising  the  Total  Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program  under  the  Clean Water Act. The TMDL  issue  is  an  important  policy  matter,  one  with  significant  consequences  for  public  use  of  our  Nation\u2019s  surface  waters  and  for  many  businesses,  farmers  and  others  who  will  be  affected  by  the  rule.  No  doubt,  this  issue  is  controversial  and  merits  careful  consideration  and  debate.  However,  the  TMDL  provision  inserted  into  the  Military  Construction  and  Supplemental  Appropriations  bill  inappropriately  transfers  the  decision  regarding  the  TMDL  rule  from  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  to  the  Senate  and  House  Appropriations Committees.  This  rider  is  not  germane  to  the  underlying  bill,  was  inserted  into  the  Conference  Report  without  any  public  debate,  and  cannot  be  amended.  In  my  view,  important  decisions  regarding  environmental  policy  should  not  be  made  behind  closed  doors  and  out  of  public  view.  This  type  of  backdoor  legislating  circumvents  the  legislative  process  of  debate  and  amendment,  and  abuses  the  public  trust.  By  including  this  language  in  a  conference  report  that  cannot  be  amended,  Senators  must  either  accept  the  offensive  provision,  or  vote  down  an  appropriations  bill containing important funds for disaster  relief,  humanitarian  aid,  and  national defense.  Since the bill provides critical assistance  to  people  that  need  help,  I  reluctantly support its passage.  Mr.  MCCAIN.  Mr.  President,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  address  the  Senate  once  again  on  the  subject  of  military construction projects added to  an appropriations bill that were not requested  by  the  Department  of  Defense.  This  bill  contains  more  than  $1.5  billion  in  unrequested  military  construction  projects.  More  importantly,  I  would  like  to  spend  a  few  minutes  discussing  the  thorough  perversion  of  the  budget  process  by  Congress  in  its  relentless  pursuit  of  the  other  white  meat.  There  is  $4.5  billion  in  pork-barrel  spending  in  this  bill,  $3.3  billion  of  that  total  in  the  so-called  \u2018\u2018emergency  supplemental.\u2019\u2019  Webster\u2019s,  Mr.  President,  defines  \u2018\u2018emergency\u2019\u2019  as  \u2018\u2018a  sudden,  generally  unexpected  occurrence  or  set  of  circumstances  demanding  immediate  action.\u2019\u2019 What we have here is the antithesis  of  that  concept.  It  is  ironic  that  the  emergency  spending  bill  before  us  today  includes  $20  million  for  abstinence education, because the taxpayers  are  really  getting  screwed. For months  the  leadership  of  this  body  made  a  deliberate decision not to act quickly and  deliberately  with  regard  to  legitimate  spending  issues  involving  military  readiness  and  the  crisis  in  Colombia.  The  decision  was  made  not  to  treat  these  essential  and  time-sensitive  activities  as  expeditiously  as  possible.  Now,  after many months  and  a  legislative  trail  more  complicated  and  illogical  than  any  Rube  Goldberg  contraption,  we  are  presented  with  an  $11  billion  bill  replete  with  earmarks  that  under  no  credible  criteria  should  be  categorized  as  \u2018\u2018emergency\u2019\u2019\u2014and  this  is  in  addition  to  the  over  $1.5  billion  added  to  the  underlying  military  construction  appropriations  bill  for  strictly parochial reasons.  Mr.  President,  as  everyone  here  is  aware, I regularly review spending bills  for  items  that  were  not  requested  by  the  Administration,  constitute  earmarks  designed  to  benefit  specific  projects  or  localities,  and  did  not  go  through  a  competitive,  merit-based  selection  process.  I  submit  lists  of  such  items  to  the  generally  prior  to  final  passage  of  the  spending bill in question. In the case of  the Military Construction bill for fiscal  year 2001, I submitted such a list, along  with a statement critical of the process  by  which  that  bill  was  put  together,  particularly  the  over  $700  million  worth of military construction projects  added  to  that  bill  that  were  not  requested  by  the  Department  of  Defense\u2014an amount,  I  reiterate, that was  doubled  in  conference  with  the  rarely  fiscally responsible other Body.  This is an institution that has proven  itself  incapable  of  passing  legislation  on  an  expedited  basis  that  genuinely  warrants  the  categorization  of  \u2018\u2018emergency.\u2019\u2019  Funding  for  ongoing  military  operations  that  strains  readiness  accounts  is  a  case  in  point.  The  one  thing, Mr. President, we can pass without  hesitation  and  consideration  is  money  for  pork-barrel  projects.  Just  prior  to  final  passage  back  in  May  of  the  Military  Construction  appropriations  bill,  the  Appropriations  Committee  pushed  through  $460  million  for  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD,  six  new  C\u2013130J  aircraft  for  the  Coast  Guard\u2014the very aircraft that we throw  money  at  with  wanton  abandon  as  though  our  very  existence  as  an  institution is dependent upon the continued  acquisition of that aircraft.  That  funding  and  those  aircraft  are  in  the  bill  that  emerged  from  conference  with  the  House.  A  consensus  exists,  apparently,  that  we  must  have  six  more  C-l3OJs  in  addition  to  the  ones  added  to  the  defense  appropriations  bill  despite  a  surplus  in  the  Department  of  Defense  of  C\u2013130  airframes  that  should  see  us  through  to  the  next  millennium  and  beyond.  Message  to  parents saving up for little junior\u2019s college  education:  invest  in  the  stock  of  the  company  that  makes  C\u2013130s;  the  United  States  Congress  will  ensure  your  offsprinq  never  need  student  loans.  Compared  to  the  $460  million  for  the  C\u2013130s,  it  hardly  seems  worth  it  to  mention  the  $25  million  added  to  this  emergency  spending  measure  for  yet  another  Gulfstream  jet,  other  than  to  point  out  that  it  is  manufactured  in  the same state as the C\u2013130s.  It  was  reassuring  that  a  compromise  was  reached  on  the  issue  of  helicopters  for  Colombia.  It  is  extremely  unfortunate, however,  that  an  issue  of  life  and  death for Colombian soldiers being sent  into  combat  to  fight  well-armed  drug  traffickers  and  the  15,000-strong  guerrilla  army  that  protects  them  was  predicated  upon  parochial  considerations.  Valid  operational  reasons  existed  for  the  decision  by  the  Department  of  Defense  and  the  Colombian  Government to request Blackhawk helicopters,  and  the  Senate\u2019s  decision  to  substitute  those  Blackhawks  for  Huey  IIs  was  among  the  more  morally  reprehensible  actions  I  have  witnessed  within  the  narrow  realm  of  budgetary  decision-making by Congress.  Specific to  the Military Construction  Appropriations  Act  for  Fiscal  Year  2001,  it  continues  to  strain  credibility  to  peruse  this  legislation  and  believe  that  considerations  other  than  pork  were  at  play.  How  else  to  explain  the  millions of dollars added to this bill for  National  Guard  Armories,  which,  in  a  typically  Orwellian  gesture,  are  now  referred  to  as  \u2018\u2018Readiness  Centers?\u2019\u2019  Whether  the  $6.4  million  added  for  a  new  dining  facility  at  Sheppard  Air  Force  Base:  the  $12  million  for  a  new  fitness  center  at  Langley  Air  Force  Base;  the  $5.8  million  for  a  joint  personnel  training  center  at  Fairchild  Air  Force  Base,  Alaska;  the  $3.5  million  added  for  an  indoor  rifle  range  and  $1.8  million for a religious ministry facility  at  the  Naval  Reserve  Station  in  Fort  Worth,  Texas;  the  $4  million  added  for  the New Hampshire Air National Guard  Pease  International  Trade  Port;  the  $4  million  for a Kentucky National Guard  parking  structure;  and  the  $14  million  added  for New York National Guard  facilities  all  constitute  vital  spending  initiatives is highly questionable.

Mr.  President,  for  most  of the 1990s, the average gasoline prices  in  Honolulu  hovered  at  roughly  25  cents to 50 cents above the national average.  In  June  1999,  only  1  year  ago,  Hawaii\u2019s  price  of  $1.51  per  gallon  ranked  above  Oregon\u2019s  at  $1.44  and  the  national average of $1.14.  As  late  as  last  month,  according  to  the  Automobile  Association  of  America,  Hawaii  topped  the  Nation  with  an  average  per  gallon  price  of  $1.85,  compared  to  the  next  highest  state,  Nevada,  at  $1.67  and  a  U.S.  average  of  $1.51.  This  month,  according  to  AAA,  Hawaii  ranked  fourth  highest  with  an  average price for regular unleaded of $1.86  per gallon. That fell below Illinois with  an  average  of  $1.98,  Michigan  at  $1.96,  and  Wisconsin  at  $1.91.  Still,  Hawaii\u2019s  price  was  well  above  the  U.S.  average  of $1.63.  It  is  no  pleasure  to  say  that  Hawaii  has  lost  this  dubious  distinction  as  the  State  with  the  Nation\u2019s  highest  gasoline  prices.  The  pocketbooks  of  Americans are hurting all over the country.  There  has  been  no  shortage  of  blame\u2014short  supplies,  pipeline  problems,  cleaner  gasoline  requirements,  too  much  driving  and  gas  guzzlers,  oil  company  manipulations,  even  an  esoteric  patent  dispute,  to name  a  few. So  far,  the  initial  examination  of  the  causes  of  the  dramatic  increase  of  prices in some areas of the Midwest has  provided  no  clear  picture.  The  Clinton  administration  has  asked  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  to  investigate  if  there  were  any  illegal  price  manipulations  in  the  Midwest  leading  to  such  dramatic price increases.  This  problem  of  dependence  on  imported  oil  has  been  in  the  making  for  many  years.  Our  import  dependence  has  been  rising  for  the  past  2  decades.  The  combination  of  lower  domestic  production  and  increased  demand  has  led  to  imports  making  up  a  larger  share  of  total  oil  consumed  in  the  United  States.  In  1992,  crude  oil  imports  accounted  for  approximately  45  percent  of  our  domestic  demand.  Last  year crude oil  imports accounted  for  58  percent.  The  Energy  Information  Administration\u2019s  Short-Term  Outlook  forecasts  that  oil  imports  will  exceed  60  percent  of  total  demand  this  year.  EIA\u2019s  long-term  forecasts  have  oil  imports  constituting  66  percent  of  U.S.  supply  by  2010,  and  more  than  71  percent by 2020.  Continued  reliance  on  such  large  quantities  of  imported  oil  will  frustrate  our  efforts  to  develop  a  national  energy  policy  and  set  the  stage  for  energy emergencies in the future.  For  months  now,  we  have  watched  the price of gasoline and fuel oil rise at  breakneck  speed.  All  across  America,  families  have  suffered  ever-escalating  prices.  We have not had a coherent and comprehensive  energy  policy  for  a  long  time.  Additionally,  we  have  not  had  a  commitment to address our dependence  on  foreign  sources of oil. Absence of an  effective  policy  and  a  visible  commitment  to  addressing  our  energy  dependence  have  made  us  hostage  to  OPEC\u2019s  production decision. It has also encouraged  Mexico,  our  NAFTA  partner,  to  join OPEC in limiting oil supplies.  We  all  understand  that  there  is  no  overnight solution to America\u2019s energy  problems.  We  can\u2019t  turn  this  trend  around  overnight.  Tax  repeals  and  other  such  short-term  actions  may  appear  appealing,  given  the  political  climate, and may even provide limited relief  in  the  short  run,  but  they  do  not  provide  a  solution  to  our  energy  problem. They  do not  provide  a  sound  basis  for  a  national  energy  policy.  Their  unintended  consequences  may  be  other  problems  such  as  deficits  in  highway  and transit funds.  The  only  way  to  reverse  our  energy  problem  is  to  have  a  multifaceted  energy strategy and remain committed to  that  strategy.  In  my  judgment,  you  need  both  of  these  in  equal  portions.  This will send a clear message to OPEC  and  their  partners  about  America\u2019s  resolve.  The  way  to  improve  our  energy  outlook  is  to  adopt  energy  conservation,  encourage  energy  efficiency,  and  support renewable energy programs. Above  all,  we  must  develop  energy  resources  that  diversify  our  energy  mix  and  strengthen  our  energy  security.  Natural gas appears  to be  the most attractive fuel to form the cornerstone of our  energy  policy.  It  is  the  right  fuel  to  bridge  the  energy  and  environmental  issues facing us.  If we are to have a comprehensive energy  policy  that  strengthens  our  economy and serves the real needs of Americans,  then  we  need  to  dismantle  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil  as  soon  as  possible.  And  the  way  to  do  this  is  to  begin  using  more  natural  gas\u2014a  domestically  abundant  fuel\u2014that  is  safe  and  reliable  to  deliver,  more  environmentally  friendly  than  oil,  and  over  three  times  as  energy-efficient  as  electricity from the point of origin to point  of use.  Let  me  state  those  facts  again:  Natural  gas  is  plentiful,  efficient,  environmentally  friendly,  and  it  is  a  domestic  fuel source.  Natural  gas  offers  itself  as  a  good  choice  for  the  fuel  of  the  future.  It  offers  us  many  advantages  that  other  fuels  do  not.  About  85  percent  of  the  natural  gas  consumed  in  America  each  year is produced domestically. The balance  is  imported  almost  entirely  from  Canada. We  have  a  large  domestic  natural  gas  resource  base  and  advances  in  exploration  and  production  technologies are allowing increased production.  We  also  have  potentially  vast  resources  in  the  form  of  methane  hydrates.  This  resource  base  is  yet  to  be  explored.  Natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel.  Wider  use  of  natural  gas  will  be  more  benign to the environment compared to  some  other  fuel  sources.  Natural  gas  would  emit  reduced  levels  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  would  not  contribute  to  acid  rain,  smog,  solid  waste, or water pollution.  We  must  invest  in  technologies  that  help facilitate wider application of natural  gas.  New  technologies  such  as  micro turbines, fuel cells, and other on-  site  power  systems  are  environmentally attractive. Wider use of these  technologies  in  the  private  and  public  sectors must be  facilitated. All Federal  research  and  development  programs  should  be  reevaluated  to  provide  them  with  a  clear  direction.  We  must  boost  support  for  those  programs  that  help  replace imported oil.  Transportation  demands  on  imported  oil  remain  as  strong  as  ever.  Since  the  oil  shock  of  the  1970s,  all major  energy  consuming sectors of our economy with  the  exception  of  transportation  have  significantly  reduced  their  dependence  on  oil.  The  transportation  sector  remains  almost  totally  dependent  on  oil-  based  motor  fuels.  The  fuel  efficiency  of  our  vehicles  needs  to  be  improved.  At  the  same  time,  we  must  make  a  concerted  effort  to  encourage  development  and  use  of  alternative  vehicle  fuels.  Natural  gas  vehicles  should  be  made  an  integral  part  of  our  transportation sector.  If  coal  was  the  energy  source  of  the  nineteenth century, and oil was the energy  source  of  the  twentieth  century,  then  I  submit  natural  gas  can  and  should  be  America\u2019s  source  of  energy  for the twenty-first century.  Americans  are  demanding  an  energy  system  that  will  guarantee  adequate  energy for future needs, protect the environment,  and  protect  consumers  from exploitation.  We  are  facing  numerous  problems  related to energy such as runaway prices,  shortages,  increases  in  pollution,  self-  sufficiency,  and  the  effect  of  energy  on  our economy.

            "68": "S6252  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE June 30, 2000  to inventories and analysis of the large  roadless  areas  in  our  National  Forests.  Then we had RARE  II under  the Carter  Administration.  That  process  was  followed  by  a  number  of  state-specific  bills,  such  as  the  Oregon  Wilderness  Act  of  1984,  where  roadless  areas  that  were  suitable  for  wilderness  protection  were  so  designated  and  other  roadless  areas  were  to  be  released  for  multiple  uses.  Despite  the  growth  of  the  wilderness  system  in  this  country,  the  management  of  other  roadless  areas  has  remained  controversial.  Now  this  Administration  has  proposed  a  roadless  initiative  that  would  permanently  ban  road  construction  from  some  43  million  acres  of  inventoried  roadless  areas.  In  addition,  this  draft  EIS  calls  for  each  Forest,  upon  its  periodic  Forest  Plan  revision,  to  protect additional  roadless areas, often  referred  to  as  uninventoried  roadless  areas.  No  one,  not  even  the  Forest  Service,  seems  to know how many millions  of  acres  that  may  ultimately  be.  So  the  President  is  proposing  setting  aside  an  additional  45  to  60  million  acres  of  the National Forest  system  on  top  of  the  35  million  acres  that  are  already  designated  as  wilderness  areas.  Let  me  remind  my  colleagues  that  the  entire  National  Forest  System  is  192  million  acres  and  that  there  are  numerous riparian areas and wildlife buffer zones that are also off limits to road  construction.  So  we  may  well  have  more  than  half  of  our  National  Forest  System  permanently  set  aside  and  inaccessible  to most  of  the  public  by  the  time this Administration is through.  What  is  even more  alarming  to me  is  the  position  of  the  Vice  President  on  this  issue.  In a  speech  to  the League of  Conservation  Voters  last  month,  AL  said  the  Administration\u2019s  preferred  alternative  does  not  go  far  enough.  Perhaps  Mr.  GORE\u2019s  \u2018\u2018Progress  and  Prosperity\u2019\u2019  tour  should  make  a  few  stops  in  rural Oregon  so he  can  see  first-hand  the  results  of  eight  years  of  passive  management  of  our  federal  lands\u2014double  digit  unemployment  and  four  day  school  weeks.  As  part  of  the  Administration  that  is  writing  this  rule  and  is  supposedly  keeping  an  open  mind  while  taking  comments  from  the  public  this  month,  it  seems  a  bit  premature  for  the Vice President  to  speak  so  favorably  of  an  alternative  that  is  ostensibly  still  being  reviewed.  I  know  the  Chairman  of  the  Senate  Energy  Committee  and  the  Chairman  of  the  House  Resources  Committee  have  requested  the Vice President  recuse himself  from  the  rest  of  this  rule-making  process.  I agree with  the Chairmen and  hope  the  Vice  President  will  try  to  restore  the  public\u2019s  confidence  that  this  rule-making  is  not  predetermined  and  that  it  is  open,  as  required  by  law,  to  the  comments  and  suggestions  of  the  public.  Mr. President, some of my colleagues  may ask why new  roads may be needed  in  the  National  Forest  System.  There  are  many  reasons,  but  perhaps  the  most urgent purpose is forest health.  GORE A  century  of  fire  suppression  followed  by  years  of  inactive  forest  management  under  this  Administration  have  left  our  National  Forest  System  overstocked  with  underbrush  and  unnaturally  dense  tree  stands  that  are  now  at  risk  of  catastrophic  wildfire.  The  GAO  recently  found  that  at  least  39 million  acres  of  the  National  Forest  System  are  at  high  risk  for  catastrophic  fire.  According  to  the  Forest  Service,  26  million  acres  are  at  risk  from insects and disease infestations as  well.  The  built  up  fuel  loads  in  these  forests  create  abnormally  hot wildfires  that  are  extremely  difficult  to  control.  This  year\u2019s  fires  in  New  Mexico  have  given  us  a  preview  of  what  is  to  come  throughout  our  National  Forest  System  if  we  continue  this  Administration\u2019s  policy  of  passive  forest  management.  To  prevent  catastrophic  fire  and  widespread  insect  infestation  and  disease outbreaks, these forests need to be  treated. The underbrush needs to be removed.  The  forests  must  be  thinned  to  allow the remaining trees to grow more  rapidly  and  more  naturally.  While  some  of  this work  can  be  done without  roads,  roads  are  many  times  required  in  order  to  carry  out  this  necessary  work.  Yet  this  Administration  apparently  wants  to  make  it  more  difficult  to  address  these  problems,  more  difficult  to  stop  fires  like  those  in  New  Mexico  before  they  start. And  the Vice  President  wants  to  go  even  further  than that.  Why  else  are  roads  needed  in  the National  Forest  System?  Forest  roads  provide millions  of Americans with  access  to  the  National  Forests  for  recreational  purposes.  With  the  Forest  Service  predicting  tremendous  increases in recreational visits to the National  Forest  System  in  the  coming  years,  shouldn\u2019t  there  at  least  be  a  thorough  examination  of  how  this  roadless  plan  will  affect  the  remaining  areas  of  our  National  Forests,  which  will  apparently  have  to  absorb most  of  these new visitors? And what about the  needs  of  seniors  and  disabled  visitors?  Compounding the problem, this Administration  will  be  decommissioning  many  roads  currently  used  by  recreational  visitors.  In  its  rush  to  complete  this  sweeping  rule,  this  Administration does not  seem  to have  the  time  to  examine  seriously  the  impacts  of  steering  more  and  more  recreational  visitors  to  a  smaller  percentage  of  the  Forest System.  Mr.  President,  I  am  also  concerned  about  how  this  roadless  initiative  is  supposed  to  interact  with  the  Northwest  Forest  Plan.  Last  year,  I  came  to  the  floor  of  the  Senate  and  I  expressed  concerns  about  this  Administration\u2019s  forestry  policies  and  its  weak  implementation  of  its  own  plan  that  was  supposed  to  lay  the  groundwork  for  a  cooperative  resolution  to  the  timber  disputes  of  the  early  1990s.  Unfortunately,  as  our  federal  agencies  scour  the  forests  to  survey  for  mosses,  we  continue to have gridlock in the Northwest,  with  none  of  the  promised  sustainable  and  predictable  timber  harvests  in sight. So how much confidence  does  this  Administration  have  in  its  own  Northwest  Forest  Plan?  By  reading  its  roadless  proposal,  the  answer  is  \u2018\u2018not  much.\u2019\u2019  Clinton\u2019s  Northwest  Forest  Plan  has  thorough  standards  and  guidelines  for  activities  in  the  forests  covered  by  the  plan,  including  roadbuilding.  This  Administration  had  previously exempted the Northwest Forest  Plan  forests  from  its  road  building  moratoriums  because  it  was  still  clinging to the notion that its plan was  the model  for  forestry  policy  in  the  future.  Unlike  those  temporary  moratoria,  however,  the  Administration\u2019s  roadless  initiative  makes  no  exception  for  the  forests  covered  by  the  Northwest  Forest  Plan.  To me,  this  suggests  that  even  this  Administration  is  acknowledging  what  many  in  the  Northwest have said for some time: The Clinton  Forest  Plan  is  a  failure.  Rural  Oregon  already knew  that. Now with  this  roadless  proposal,  this  Administration  will only make  it harder  for any  future  Administration  to  keep  its  promises  under  the  Northwest  Forest  Plan.  This  fact  is  most  obvious  in  the  town  of  Klamath  Falls  in  southern  Oregon.  Like many towns in the Northwest surrounded  by  federal  lands,  Klamath  Falls  was  encouraged  by  this  Administration  to  create  jobs  and  economic  growth  through  recreation  and  eco-  tourism  in  order  to  compensate  for  the  loss  of  the  timber  jobs.  Of  course,  it  is  difficult  to  find  substitutes  for  the  family  wage  jobs  that  the  timber  industry  once  provided  for  these  towns.  Nevertheless,  rural Oregon  has  tried  to  diversify its economy.  More  than  three  years  ago,  developers  and  community  leaders  in  Klamath  Falls  embarked  upon  the  arduous  process  of  obtaining  a  special  use  permit  to  launch  a  winter  recreation  area  at Pelican Butte in the nearby Winema  National  Forest.  Millions  of  dollars  were  spent  and  countless  hours  were  invested  by  everyone  from  the  local  forest  service,  to  the developers,  to  the  local  government  and  the  community  as  a  whole.  A  final  Environmental  Impact Statement and Record of Decision  are due next year. Now, due  to  the  fact  that  Pelican  Butte  will  require  three  miles of road in a currently inventoried  roadless  area,  the  Administration\u2019s  roadless  initiative  will  effectively  kill  the  plan.  In  its  zeal  to  complete  this  plan  before  leaving  office,  this  Administration  apparently  does  not  want  to  take  the  time  to  make  reasonable  accommodations  for  proposals  that  have  been  in  the  pipeline  for  years.  Never  mind  the  fact  that  the  Pelican  Butte  project  will  result  in  a  net  decrease  in  road mileage  on National Forest  lands.  Never  mind  the  fact  that  Oregonians  were  told  by  this  Administration  to  go  and  find  other  means  to  develop  their  economy  outside  of  timber.  The  message  to  Oregonians  is  clear:  If  the  roadless  plan  is  to  be  concluded  before  President Clinton leaves office, there is  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:41 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00068 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S30JN0.REC S30JN0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",

CON. RES. 127  Whereas  the  Parthenon  was  built  on  the  hill of the Acropolis at Athens, Greece in the  mid-fifth  century B.C. under  the  direction  of  the Athenian  statesman Pericles  and  the  design of the sculptor Phidias.  Whereas  the Parthenon  is  the  ultimate  expression  of  the  artistic  genius  of Greece,  the  preeminent  symbol  of  the  Greek  cultural  heritage\u2014its  art,  architecture,  and  democracy\u2014and  of  the  contributions  that  modern  Greeks  and  their  forefathers  have  made  to  civilization;  Whereas  over  100  pieces  of  the Parthenon\u2019s  sculptures\u2014now  known  as  the  Parthenon  Marbles\u2014were  removed  from  the  Parthenon  under  questionable  circumstances  between  1801  and  1816,  while  Greece  was  still  under  Ottoman rule;  Whereas  the  removal  of  the  Parthenon  Marbles,  including  their  perilous  voyage  to  Great  Britain  and  their  careless  storage  there for many years, greatly endangered the  Marbles;  Whereas  the  Parthenon  Marbles  were  removed  to  grace  the  private  home  of  Lord  Elgin,  who  transferred  the  Marbles  to  the  British  Museum  only  after  severe  personal  economic misfortunes;  Whereas  the  sculptures  of  the  Parthenon  were  designed  as  an  integral  part  of  the  structure of  the Parthenon  temple;  the  carvings  of  the  friezes,  pediments,  and  metopes  are not merely  statuary, movable  decorative  art,  but  are  integral  parts  of  the  Parthenon,  which  can  best  be  appreciated  if  all  the  Parthenon Marbles are reunified;  Whereas  the  Parthenon  has  served  as  a  place  of  worship  for  ancient  Greeks,  Orthodox  Christians,  Roman  Catholics,  and  Muslims;  Whereas  the  Parthenon  has  been  adopted  by  imitation  by  the  United  States  in  many  preeminent  public  buildings,  including  the  Lincoln Memorial;  Whereas the Parthenon  is a universal symbol  of  culture,  democracy,  and  freedom,  making  the  Parthenon  Marbles  of  concern  not only to Greece but to all the world;  Whereas,  since  obtaining  independence  in  1830,  Greece  has  sought  the  return  of  the  Parthenon Marbles;  Whereas  the  return  of  the  Parthenon  Marbles  would  be  a  profound  demonstration  by  the  United  Kingdom  of  its  appreciation  and  respect for the Parthenon and classical art;  Whereas,  even  without  considering  the  legal  issues  surrounding  the  removal  of  the  Parthenon  Marbles,  the  United  Kingdom  should  return  them  in  recognition  that  the  Parthenon  is  part  of  the  cultural  heritage  of  the  entire  world  and,  as  such,  should  be  made whole;  Whereas Greece would  provide  care  for  the  Parthenon  Marbles  equal  or  superior  to  the  care  provided  by  the  British  Museum,  especially  considering  the  irreparable  harm  caused  by  attempts  by  the  museum  to  remove  the  original  color  and  patina  of  the  marbles with abrasive cleaners;  Whereas Greece  is constructing a new, permanent  museum  to  house  all  the  Marbles,  protected  from  the  elements and  in  full view  of the Acropolis;  Whereas  Greece  and  various  international  committees  have  pledged  to  work  with  the  British  government  to  negotiate  mutually  agreeable  conditions  for  the  return  of  the  Parthenon Marbles;  Whereas  the  people  of  the United Kingdom  do  not  have  an  ancient  bond  to  the  Parthenon Marbles, given that the Marbles have  been  in London  for  less  than  200 years  of  the  over  2,430  year  history  of  the  Parthenon  was  built,  and  as  evidenced  by  a  1998  poll  in  which  only  15  percent  of  the  Britons  polled  recalled having seen the Marbles  in the British Museum;  Whereas  the  British  people  support  the  return  of  the  Parthenon  Marbles,  as  reflected  in several recent polls;  Whereas  a  resolution  signed  by  a  majority  of  members  of  the  European  Parliament  urged  the  British  government  to  return  the  Parthenon  Marbles  to  their  natural  setting  in Greece;  Whereas the British House of Commons Select Committee  on Culture, Media  and Sport  is  to  be  commended  for  examining  the  issue  of  the  disposition  of  the  Parthenon  Marbles  in hearings held this year;  Whereas  returning  the  Parthenon  Marbles  to Greece would  be  a  gesture  of  good will  on  the  part  of  the  British  Parliament,  and  would  in  no  way  affect  the  disposition  of  other  objects  in  museums  around  the  world;  and  Whereas in 2004 the Olympics will return to  Greece,  where  the  Olympics  began,  and  the  Parthenon  Marbles  should  be  returned  to  their  home  in  Athens  by  that  time:  Now,  therefore, be it  Resolved  by  the  Senate  (the  House  of  Representatives  concurring),  That  it  is  the  sense  of  the  Congress  that  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  should  enter  into  negotiations with the Government of Greece as soon  as  possible  to  facilitate  the  return  of  Parthenon  Marbles  to  Greece  before  Olympics in 2004.  the  the  f  CONCURRENT  RESOLUTION  128\u2014  URGING  THE  NOBEL  COMMISSION  TO  AWARD  THE  NOBEL  PRIZE  FOR  PEACE  TO  HIS  HOLINESS,  POPE  JOHN  PAUL  II,  FOR  HIS  DEDICATION  TO  FOSTERING  PEACE  THROUGHOUT  THE  WORLD  Mr.  SANTORUM  lowing  concurrent  was  referred  to  the  eign Relations:  submitted  the  folresolution;

RES. 128  Whereas  His  Holiness,  Pope  John  Paul  II,  has  worked  tirelessly  and  as  much  as  any  other  world  leader  to  bring  peace  to  regions  of  the  world  which  have  known  strife,  intolerance, and violence for far too long;  Whereas  His  Holiness,  Pope  John  Paul  II,  knows  the  persecution  of  oppression,  having  studied  for  the  priesthood  in  secrecy  and  having seen those he grew up with killed and  victimized  due  to  the  Nazi  Occupation,  and  later  witnessing  firsthand  the  communist  subjugation of his native Poland;  Whereas  His  Holiness,  Pope  John  Paul  II,  since  his  installment  as  Cardinal  of  the  Church,  has  traveled  more  extensively  throughout  the  world  than  any  predecessor,  spreading  his  message  of  peace,  religious  freedom, and human dignity;  Whereas  His  Holiness,  Pope  John  Paul  II,  was  instrumental  in  the  demise  of  communism  in  his  native  Poland,  which  in  turn  fostered the spread of democracy throughout  the world;  Whereas  His  Holiness,  Pope  John  Paul  II,  has  reached out  in an unprecedented manner  to people of other beliefs and  religions  to  establish  a  dialog  which  may  lead  to  greater  understanding,  healing,  and  harmony,  including  praying  for  unity  among  Christian  churches,  reaching  out  towards  a  reconciliation  with  the  Jewish  people,  and  specifically  acknowledging  those  times  the  Catholic  Church  has  failed  to  act  in  accordance  with its teachings;  Whereas  in  March  of  this  year,  His  Holiness,  Pope  John  Paul  II,  led  a  historic  pilgrimage  to  the  Middle  East,  including  Jordan,  Israel,  and  the  Palestinian  territories,  preaching  coexistence,  peace,  tolerance,  and  goodwill  throughout  this  historically  conflicted territory; and  Whereas  His  Holiness,  Pope  John  Paul  II,  has used his position as a world  leader to become  the  foremost  voice  to  foster  ties  of  brotherhood  and  for  the  promotion  of  peace  and  reconciliation  in  the  world  today:  Now,  therefore, be it  Resolved  by  the  Senate  (the  House  of  Representatives  concurring),  That  the  Congress  urges  the  Nobel  Commission  to  award  the  Nobel  Prize  for  Peace  to  His  Holiness,  Pope  John Paul II.  f  SENATE  CONCURRENT  RESOLUTION  129\u2014EXPRESSING  THE  SENSE  OF  CONGRESS  REGARDING  THE  IMPORTANCE  AND  VALUE  OF  EDUCATION  IN  UNITED  STATES  HISTORY  Mr.  LIEBERMAN  (for  himself,  Mr.  Mr.  of  Oregon,  Mr.  Mr.  BYRD,  Mr.  Mr.  and  Mr.  submitted  the  following  concurrent  resolution;  which was considered and agreed to:  CONRAD,  GRAMS)  GORTON,  CLELAND,  BENNETT,  SMITH VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:41 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S30JN0.REC S30JN0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",

SENSE  OF  THE  SENATE  THE  DELIVERY  OF  MEDICAL SERVICES.  REGARDING  EMERGENCY  (a)  FINDINGS.\u2014The  lowing:  (1)  Several  States  have  developed  and  implemented  a  unique  2-tiered  emergency medical services system that effectively provides  services to the residents of those States.  (2)  These  2-tiered  systems  include  volunteer  and  for-profit  emergency  medical  technicians  who  provide  basic  life  support  and  hospital-based  paramedics  who  provide  advanced life support.  (3)  These  2-tiered  systems  have  provided  universal access for residents of those States  to  affordable  emergency  services,  while  simultaneously  ensuring  that  those  persons  in  need  of  the most  advanced  care  receive  such  care from the proper authorities.  Senate  finds  the  fol(4)  One  State\u2019s  2-tiered  system  currently  has  an  estimated  20,000  emergency  medical  technicians  providing  ambulance  transportation  for  basic  life  support  and  advanced  life  support  emergencies,  over  80  percent  of  which are handled by volunteers who are not  reimbursed  under  the  medicare  program  under  title XVIII  of  the Social Security Act.  (5)  The  hospital-based  paramedics,  also  known as mobile intensive care units, are reimbursed  under  the  medicare  program  when  they  respond  to  advanced  life  support  emergencies.  (6)  These  2-tiered  State  health  systems  save  the  lives  of  thousands  of  residents  of  those  States  each  year,  while  saving  the  medicare  program,  in  some  instances,  as  much as $39,000,000 in reimbursement fees.  (7)  When  Congress  requested  that  the  Health Care Financing Administration enact  changes  to  the  emergency  medical  services  fee  schedule  as  a  result  of  the  Balanced  Budget Act  of  1997,  including  a  general  overhaul of reimbursement rates and administrative  costs,  it  was  in  the  spirit  of  streamlining  the  agency,  controlling  skyrocketing  health  care  costs,  and  lengthening  the  solvency of the medicare program.  (8) The Health Care Financing Administration  is  considering  implementing  new  emergency  medical  services  reimbursement  guidelines  that  may  destabilize  the  2-tier  system  that  have  developed  in  these  States.  (b)  SENATE.\u2014It  is  the  sense  of  the  Senate  that  the  Health  Care  Financing Administration should\u2014  (1)  consider  the  unique  nature  of  2-tiered  emergency medical services delivery systems  when  implementing  new  reimbursement  guidelines  for  paramedics  and  hospitals  under  the  medicare  program  under  title  XVIII of the Social Security Act; and  (2)  promote  innovative  emergency  medical  service  systems  enacted  by  States  that  reduce  reimbursement  costs  to  the  medicare  program while ensuring that all residents receive  quick  and  appropriate  emergency  care  when needed.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of  this  Act,  amounts  made  available  under  titles  I  and  II,  and  this  title,  for  salaries  and  expenses  at  the  Departments  of  Labor,  Health  and  Human  Services,  and  Education,  respectively,  shall  be  further  reduced  on  a  pro rata basis by $15,000,000.

SENSE OF THE  SENATE REGARDING  IMPACTS  OF  THE  BALANCED  BUDGET  ACT OF 1997.  (a)  FINDINGS.\u2014The  lowing findings:  (1)  Since  its  passage  in  1997,  the  Balanced  Budget  Act  of  1997  has  drastically  cut  payments  under  the  medicare  program  under  title XVIII  of  the  Social  Security Act  in  the  areas  of  hospital,  home  health,  and  skilled  nursing  care,  among  others.  While  Congress  intended to cut approximately $100,000,000,000  from  the medicare  program  over  5  years,  recent  estimates  put  the  actual  cut  at  over  $200,000,000,000.  (2)  A  recent  study  on  home  health  care  found  that  nearly  70  percent  of  hospital  discharge  planners  surveyed  reported  a  greater  difficulty obtaining home health  services  for  medicare beneficiaries as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.  (3) According to the Medicare Payment Advisory  Commission,  rural  hospitals  were  disproportionately  affected  by  the  Balanced  Budget  Act  of  1997,  dropping  the  inpatient  margins  of  such  hospitals  over  4  percentage  points in 1998.

            "108": "S6292  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE June 30, 2000  DASCHLE  In  fact,  when  asked  for  detailed  targeting information we were given three  different  answers.  First,  we  were  told  that they did not bring that kind of information.  Then,  we  were  told  there  were  people  in  the  room  who  were  not  cleared to receive that kind of information. Finally, we were told that kind of  information  is  only  provided  to  the  Senate  leadership  and  members  of  the  Armed  Services  Committee.  Because  members of the leadership and the Senate  Armed  Services  Committee  indicated  they  had  never  received  such  information,  I  can  only  surmise  there  must be a fourth answer.  We  find  ourselves  in  an  uncomfortable  and  counter-productive  Catch-22.  Until  we  as  civilians  provide  better  guidance  to  our  military  leaders,  we  are  unlikely  to  affect  the  kind  of  changes  needed  to  update  our  nuclear  policies  to  reflect  the  realities  of  the  post-cold-war world. Yet, providing  improved  guidance  is  difficult  when  we  are  unable  to  learn  the  basic  components  of  the  SIOP.  Given  this,  I  followed  up  our  meeting  with  a  letter  to  Senate  Minority  Leader  Tom  requesting  that  he  schedule  another  briefing  so  that we  could  get  the  information our first briefers would not provide.  While  I  still  believe  this  briefing  is  needed, we  need  not wait  for  a  briefing  on  the  details  of  the  SIOP  to  answer  the  question  of  how  many  nuclear  weapons  are  needed  to  deter  potential  aggressors. In truth, it is important for  citizens,  armed  only  with  common  sense  and  open-source  information,  to  reach  sound  conclusions  about  our  nuclear posture and force levels.  To  illustrate,  we  should  ask  experts  to  describe  the  deterrent  capability  of  a  single  Trident  submarine\u2014our  most  survivable  and  reliable  delivery  platform.  Within  an  hour  of  receiving  an  order to launch, a Trident could deliver  and  detonate  192  nuclear  weapons  on  their  targets. The minimum  size  of  the  detonations  would  100  kilotons;  the  maximum  would  be  300  kilotons.  By  comparison,  the  Hiroshima  detonation  that  caused  Japan  to  sue  for  unconditional peace  in August  1945 was only  15  kilotons.  In  the  open,  we  should  assess  what  damage  192  of  these  weapons  would  cause  and  determine  whether  this  would  deter most,  if  not  all  of  the  threats we face.  Mr.  President,  I  have made  no  secret  of  my  strongly-held  belief  that  we  can  and  we  should  make  dramatic  reductions  in  our  strategic  nuclear  arsenals.  I  believe  that  by  keeping  such  a  large  arsenal  of  strategic  nuclear  weapons  we  are  decreasing  rather  than  enhancing  our  security.  By  keeping  such  a  large  arsenal  we  are  forcing  the  Russians  to  keep  more  weapons  than  they  can  safely  control.  By  keeping  such  a  large  arsenal  we  are  increasing  the  chance  of  accidental  or  unauthorized  launch.  By  keeping  such  a  large  arsenal  we  are  increasing  the  likelihood  of  the  proliferation  of  these  weapons.  By  keeping such a large arsenal we are encouraging nations  like India, Pakistan,  Iran,  and  North  Korea  to  pursue  a  nuclear  weapons  option.  And  finally,  by  keeping  such  a  large  arsenal we  are  diverting budgetary  resources away  from  our  conventional  forces\u2014the  forces  that  are  vital  to  protecting  our  interests around the globe.  In  the  near  future,  I  will  return  to  the  Senate  floor  to  discuss  this  issue  further.  I  will  return  with  non-classified  information\u2014information  that  comes  not  from  briefings  in  secret  rooms, but  information all citizens can  access  through  a  simple  search  on  Yahoo\u2014in  an  attempt  to  better  understand  our  nuclear  policy  and  the  changing  definition  of  deterrence  in  the post-Cold War world.  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  clerk will call the roll.  The  legislative  clerk  call the roll.  Mr. LOTT.

Mr.  President,  I  do  have  some  Executive  Calendar  matters  and  other  unanimous  consent  agreements  that  have  already  been  worked  out.  I  will  proceed  to  those.  However,  I  do  note  I  want  to  offer  a  unanimous  consent  request  with  regard  to  the  estate  tax  matter.  I  want  the  Democratic  leader  to  be  here when  I make  that  request.  I  am  hoping within  the  next  few  minutes  we  will  also  be  able  to  conclude  an  agreement  with  regard  to  the  Department  of  Defense  authorization  bill.

Huck,  of  Florida,  to  be  United  States  District  Judge  for  the  Southern  District  of  Florida,  vice  Kenneth  L.  Ryskamp,  retired.  John  W.  Darrah,  of  States  District  Judge  Illinois,  to  be  United  for  the  Northern  District of Illinois, vice George M. Marovich, retired.  Joan  Humphrey  Lefkow,  of  Illinois,  to  be  United  States  District  Judge  for  the  Northern District of Illinois, vice Ann C. Williams,  elevated.  George  Z.  Singal,  of  Maine,  to  be  United  States  District  Judge  for  the  District  of  Maine, vice Morton A. Brody, deceased.  f  GEORGE  CONFIRMATION  OF  SINGAL  Ms.  SNOWE.  Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased  that  the  Senate  has  confirmed  George Singal, the President\u2019s nominee  for a seat on the U.S. District Court for  the  District  of  Maine,  and  rise  to  express  my  strong  unequivocal  support  for his nomination.  In advance, I would  like to thank the  Chairman  of  the  Judiciary  Committee,  Senator HATCH,  for  proceeding  so  expeditiously  on Mr.  Singal\u2019s  nomination\u2014  especially  when  considering  his  nomination  was  transmitted  to  the  Senate  just six weeks ago. In addition, I would  like  to  thank  the  Majority  Leader  for  bringing his nomination  to  the  floor  so  rapidly\u2014just  three  days  after  being  reported by the Judiciary Committee.  George Singal immigrated along with  his  family  to  the  United  States  at  a  very  young  age,  and  has  become  a  living  embodiment  of  the  American  dream.  He  possesses  a  superior  legal  mind,  has  distinguished  himself  within  the legal profession, and is deeply committed  to  upholding  the  very  highest  standards  of  our  nation\u2019s  judicial  system.  Moreover,  Mr.  Singal  has  a  wide  range  of  experience  serving  as  both  a  prosecutor  and  as  a  defense  attorney\u2014  a  deep  understanding  and  appreciation  for the constitutionally mandated roles  of  the  three  branches  of  government\u2014  and  the  enormous  respect  of  his  colleagues,  a  number  of  whom  have  contacted  me  in  support  of  his  nomination. Finally, and just as telling, he enjoys  bipartisan  support  across  the  State of Maine.  Consider  what  George\u2019s  background  says  about  his  character  and  qualifications.  Born  in  a  refugee  camp  in  Italy  after his  family  fled before the German  invasion  of  his  native  Poland,  he  arrived  in  Bangor  along  with  his  sister  and widowed mother in 1949.  After  graduating  summa  cum  laude  from my alma mater, the University of  Maine  in  1967,  and  becoming  only  the  second  recipient  of  the  highly  respected Root-Tilden  Scholarship  in  the  history  of  the  university, George  briefly  left  our  state  to  receive  his  law  degree  from  Harvard  University  three  years later.  Indeed,  not  one  to  forget  his  roots,  George  immediately  returned  to Maine  to  begin  his  legal  career  in  Bangor,  serving  as  the  Assistant  County  Attorney  for  Penobscot  County  from  1971  to  1973,  even  as  he  worked  his  way  to  a  partnership  in  the  respected  law  firm  of Gross, Minsky, Mogul, & Singal\u2014the  firm  in  which  he  has  remained  to  this  day.

ELIOT  L.  ENGEL OF NEW YORK Congratulations,  and  Mazel  Tov,  mom.  May you  have  many,  many  more  years  of  life\u2019s pleasures,  and  may  you  continue  to  brighten the  lives of all  those  you  touch. CELEBRATING  THE  HISTORY  OF THE  MOTHER  ROAD:  BARSTOW OPENS  A  ROUTE  66  MUSEUM IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES f many RECORD,  Mr.  things  CONGRESSIONAL Thursday, June 29, 2000 ENGEL.  Mr.  Speaker,  of  the  I\u2019ve  put  into  the  this  one  gives me  the most  pleasure. Today,  on  June  29,  2000,  my  mother  is  celebrating her 80th birthday. My  mother,  Sylvia  Engel,  or  SeRoy  as  everyone  calls  her,  has  always  been  the  proverbial  \u2018\u2018live  wire.\u2019\u2019  When  I  was  a  little  boy,  she would  take  me  to  see  her  roller  skate  in  the roller  derby  practices.  She  also  is  an  accomplished  actress,  and  would  perform  on  stage in  community  and  off-Broadway  shows.  I  always  say  that  my  ability  to  speak  in  front  of groups  stems  from watching my mother  do  the same,  since  I was  a  little  boy. She was  always very  outgoing  and  to  this  day  goes  bowling every  week,  and  until  just  a  few  years  ago  directed  the  singing  and  dancing  shows  at  her condominium  in Florida. My  mother  has  always  been  a  very  kind person,  loving  and  caring  to  her  family,  one, who  along  with  my  father  always  taught  me right  from  wrong,  and  stressed  education  as the  key  to  elevating  oneself  in  helping  to  gain a better  future. My mother  and my  father, Phil,  had  the  benefit  of  47  wonderful  years  of  marriage  together,  where  they  worked  hard  and  struggled to  provide  a  good  life  for  me  and  my  sister, Dori.  Today,  my  mother  is  grandmother  to  11 children.  Pat  and  I  have  given  my  mother  3 grandchildren:  Julia,  Jonathan  and  Philip,  and Dori  and  Jordan  have  given  my  mother  8: David,  Rachel,  Yosef,  Yacov,  Naomi,  Malky, Esty, and Ricky. My  mother  was  born  in  New  York  City  as the  second  child  of  Eastern  European  Jewish immigrants,  Yudis  or  Julia  and  Joe,  who  came to  this  country,  like  so  many  others,  for  a  better  life.  Her  mother,  my  grandmother,  Julia, lived  with  us  when  I  was  growing  up  and raised  my  mother  and  her  sister  Bea  and brother  Irving,  because  she  was  widowed  at an  early  age.  My  mother,  who  they  tell  me was  a  \u2018\u2018tomboy\u2019\u2019  growing  up,  learned  to  be self-reliant  and  resilient  at  an  early  age,  traits which  she  still manifests  today. Mr.  Speaker,  I  want  to  tell  my  mother  how very  much  I  love  her  and  what  a  tremendous inspiration  she  is  to  me  today  and  has  been so  my  whole  life.  I  hesitated  entering  this  into the  and  giving  her  a surprise  party,  because  she  doesn\u2019t  look  her age,  and  doesn\u2019t  want  too  many  people  to know.  But  having  achieved  this  milestone  is something  of  which  to  be  proud,  especially after  two  heart  surgeries  and  a  lifetime  of  giving  herself  to  family,  friends,  and  everyone with  whom  she\u2019s  come  into  contact.  With  my mother,  one  can  certainly  say  she may  be  one year  older  than  last  year,  but  she\u2019ll  never  be old. CONGRESSIONAL RECORD MEDICARE  RX  2000  ACT SPEECH OF HON.  ERNEST  J.  ISTOOK,  JR. OF OKLAHOMA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, June 28, 2000 Mr.  ISTOOK.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  want  prescription  drugs  to  be  available  and  affordable,  but this  is  not  the  way  to  do  it.  If  something  is overpriced,  it\u2019s  nonsense  to  have  government step  in  and  agree  to  pay  that  inflated  price. That  is  not  good  stewardship  of  public  money. Congress  should  be  holding  hearings  about price-fixing  allegations,  and  about  whether there  is  price-gouging  of  American  patients,  to subsidize overseas  sales of prescription drugs. But  if  costs  are  exorbitant,  it\u2019s  wrong-headed to  use  tax  dollars  to  pay  those  inflated  prices. That will not bring  the prices down. Instead,  there  is  a  stampede  to  buy  the votes  of  senior  citizens,  by  spending  enormous  amounts  of  taxpayers\u2019  money  on  a  new entitlement.  I\u2019m  not  joining  that  stampede  to buy  votes  with  taxpayers\u2019  money.  I\u2019m  disappointed  that  fellow Republicans would  abandon  principles  to  buy  votes  with  promises  of  a huge  new  government  program.  Yet  the  Democrat  plan  is  worse;  its  cost  is  about  double. Both  sides  are  in  a  bidding  war,  and  both  are bidding with  taxpayers\u2019 money. The  cost  of  the  GOP  plan  is  not  \u2018\u2018only\u2019\u2019  $8 billion  a  year.  The  official  projection  says  it soon  will  be  $28  billion  a  year  and  probably  it will  be  even  higher.  It  would  be  automatic spending,  which  would  go  on  forever.  This  is how  our  national  debt  was  created,  and  why it\u2019s  so  tough  to  balance  the  budget  and  pay down  the debt. Medicare  is  already  in  major  financial  trouble.  You  don\u2019t  fix  it  by  adding  more  spending, when  it\u2019s  already  costing  too  much  and  delivering  too  little. For  example,  if  the  foundation  of  your  house is  crumbling,  you  don\u2019t  build  a  new  third  story. Instead,  you  fix  the  foundation  before  you  consider  adding  on.  That\u2019s  what  we  should  do with Medicare. Medicare\u2019s  government  bureaucracy  doesn\u2019t even  pay  hospitals  (especially  rural  hospitals) the  cost  of  the  care  they  provide.  That  drives up  medical  costs  for  everyone  who  is  not  on Medicare.  This  is  part  of  what  we  should  fix first,  before  promising  an  new  expensive  benefit. HON.  JERRY  LEWIS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 29, 2000 Mr.  LEWIS  of  California.  Mr.  Speaker,  this will  be  a  very  special  Independence  Day  in Barstow, California where we will  celebrate  the opening  of  a  museum  commemorating  Route 66,  the Mother  Road  that  led millions  of  Americans  west  to  the  promise  of  unlimited  dreams and horizons  in  the Golden State. The  opening  of  the  museum  on  July  4  will provide  a  delightful  reminder  that  the  towns and  cities of my district provided  the hospitality and  welcome  to  most  of  those  Americans making  the  long  drive  West.  Barstow  was\u2014 and  remains\u2014a  friendly  oasis  from  the  hourslong drive across  the great Mojave Desert. Visitors  will  have  a  chance  to  remember  the exciting  early  days  of  driving  America\u2019s  highways  with  old  photographs,  road  signs  and  a vintage  1926  Dodge  touring  sedan.  The  museum  has  visionary  plans  of  returning  Barstow to  its  status  as  a  way  station  along  the  desert highways. It  is  especially  commendable  that  this  museum  will  be  an  anchor  for  another  older  reminder  of  the  history  of  Western  travel:  The Casa  del  Desierto  Harvey  House,  a  historic stop opened  for  travelers  in 1911 on  the Santa Fe  Railway\u2019s  trains  to  and  from  California. Thousands  of  train  travelers  each  year stopped  to  marvel  at  this  towering  adobe  palace  and  be  served  food  by  the  famous Harvey Girls  in  its  elegant  dining  rooms.  This  magnificent  depot  and  hotel,  which  has  been  placed on  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places, has  been  fully  restored  and  returned  to  use through  the  efforts  of  Barstow\u2019s  civic  leaders and  volunteers. The  location of  the Route 66 Museum  in  this historic  railroad  structure  will  provide  modem travelers  with  a  fascinating  window  into  the past,  and  should  make  Barstow  even  more  of a popular  stopover along desert highways. This  new  museum  will  add  to  the  reputation of  San  Bernardino  County  as  one  of  the  top destinations  for  those  who  are  fans  of  Route 66  history.  It  joins  another  fine  museum  in Victorville,  another  historic  Mojave  Desert way-station,  and  the  San  Bernardino  Route  66 Rendezvous  classic  car  festival,  which  draws 600,000  visitors  each  September  in  one  of  the nation\u2019s  largest  free-admission events. Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask  you  and  my  colleagues to  join  me  in  congratulating  Barstow  and  its citizens  for  renewing  their  city\u2019s  rightful  place as  one  of  the  welcoming  points  to  California, and  one  of  the  highlights  along  Route  66,  the Mother Road. \u2022 (cid:84)(cid:104)(cid:105)(cid:115)(cid:32) (cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:98)(cid:117)(cid:108)(cid:108)(cid:101)(cid:116)(cid:39)(cid:39)(cid:32) (cid:115)(cid:121)(cid:109)(cid:98)(cid:111)(cid:108)(cid:32) (cid:105)(cid:100)(cid:101)(cid:110)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:102)(cid:105)(cid:101)(cid:115)(cid:32) (cid:115)(cid:116)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:109)(cid:101)(cid:110)(cid:116)(cid:115)(cid:32) (cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:32) (cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:115)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:115)(cid:32) (cid:119)(cid:104)(cid:105)(cid:99)(cid:104)(cid:32) (cid:97)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:110)(cid:111)(cid:116)(cid:32) (cid:115)(cid:112)(cid:111)(cid:107)(cid:101)(cid:110)(cid:32) (cid:98)(cid:121)(cid:32) (cid:97)(cid:32)(cid:77)(cid:101)(cid:109)(cid:98)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:32) (cid:111)(cid:102)(cid:32) (cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:83)(cid:101)(cid:110)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:32) (cid:77)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:32) (cid:115)(cid:101)(cid:116)(cid:32) (cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:32) this  typeface  (cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:100)(cid:105)(cid:99)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:115)(cid:32) (cid:119)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:100)(cid:115)(cid:32) (cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:115)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:100)(cid:32) (cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:32) (cid:97)(cid:112)(cid:112)(cid:101)(cid:110)(cid:100)(cid:101)(cid:100)(cid:44)(cid:32) (cid:114)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:32) (cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:97)(cid:110)(cid:32) (cid:115)(cid:112)(cid:111)(cid:107)(cid:101)(cid:110)(cid:44)(cid:32) (cid:98)(cid:121)(cid:32) (cid:97)(cid:32)(cid:77)(cid:101)(cid:109)(cid:98)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:32) (cid:111)(cid:102)(cid:32) (cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:72)(cid:111)(cid:117)(cid:115)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:102)(cid:108)(cid:111)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:46) (cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:32) (cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:102)(cid:108)(cid:111)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:46) VerDate 11<MAY>2000 06:13 Jul 01, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A30JN8.000 pfrm03 PsN: E30PT1 ",

ERNIE  FLETCHER OF KENTUCKY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 29, 2000 Mr.  FLETCHER.  Mr.  Speaker,  it\u2019s  an  honor to  speak  today  on  behalf  of  two  women  from Lexington,  KY,  who  have  been  named  Small Business  People  of  the  Year.  Jacqueline  Y. Smith  and  Deborah  L.  Dyor,  have  within  a decade  successfully  turned  their drug-research company,  Central  Kentucky  Research  Associates  into a million-dollar  company. These  two  women  began  their  company  in 1991 with  a mere  $50  and  by  1999  had  netted sales  of  $1.6  million.  It\u2019s  an  honor  for  me  to recognize  the  determination  and  commitment these  two  Central  Kentuckians  have  exhibited over  the  past  10  years.  Their  company  conducts  the  tests  required  before  the  U.S.  Food and  Drug  Administration  approves  new  drugs or  approves  new  uses  for  drugs  already  on the market. The  sacrifices  of  these  two  women  have been  enormous,  as  they  resigned  positions and  ventured  out  to  begin  Central  Kentucky Research  Associates.  Their  efforts  are  most worthy  of  the  Small  Business  People  of  the Year Award. Small  businesses  are  the  backbone  of  a community  and  epitomize  the  entrepreneurial spirit  that  has  long  existed  in  our  country.  The hard  work  of  small  businesses  owners,  such as  these  two women,  have  allowed many  generations  of  Americans  to  achieve  the  successes  and  rewards  our  nation  offers  to  all  its citizens.  I  salute  Jacqueline  Smith  and  Deborah  Dyor  for  their  dedication  and  drive,  which has  and  will  continue  to  benefit  not  only  the people of Kentucky, but all of America. f PERSONAL  EXPLANATION HON.  STEVEN  R.  ROTHMAN OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, June 28, 2000 Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Mr.  Speaker,  On  June  19, 2000,  and  on  June  23,  2000,  because  I  was attending  personal  family  events,  I  was  not present  to  record  my  votes  on  rollcall  votes No.  293  and  No.  319.  These  votes  pertained to  striking  language  in  the  Fiscal  Year  2001 VA\u2013HUD  and  Commerce-Justice-State  Judiciary  Appropriations  bills  which  prohibited  agencies  of  the  Federal  Government  from  using funds  to  pursue  lawsuits  against  tobacco  companies. Because  I  strongly  believe  that  the  tobacco companies  must  be  held  responsible  for  the millions  of  dollars  in  health  care  expenses  that the  Federal  Government  has  paid  for  tobacco related  illnesses  through  federally  funded health  care  programs,  had  I  been  present  for these  votes,  I would have  voted as  follows: On  rollcall  vote No. 293, 1 would have  voted \u2018\u2018aye.\u2019\u2019.

Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise today  to  introduce  legislation  to  rename  the post  office  located  in  Carrollton,  Georgia,  after the Honorable Sam Roberts. Sam  Roberts  was  born  on  April  10,  1937,  in Rome, Georgia.  After  obtaining  a  degree  in  insurance  and  risk  management  from  Georgia State  University  in  1963,  Sam  Roberts  delved into a  career of management, heading Roberts Insurance  Agency.  After  many  years  in  this profession,  Sam  decided  to  run  for  the  Georgia  State  Senate.  He  won  his  Senate  seat  to represent  District  30  in  1996,  and  was  reelected  in  1998.  His  second  term  was  tragically  cut  short  after  his  untimely  death  after  a long  bout  with  cancer,  on  January  3,  2000,  in Douglasville, Georgia. Throughout his  life, State Senator Sam Roberts  was  involved  in  countless  community  organizations  and  civic  clubs,  including:  President  of  the  Sertoma  Club  and  the  Douglas County  Rotary  Club;  National  Director  of  the U.S.  Jaycees  (Government  Affairs);  and  State Vice President of  the Georgia  Jaycees. He  also  served  on  the  Board  of  Directors  of the  American  Cancer  Society  and  the  March of Dimes. He was  the Chaplain  of  the  Flint Hill Masonic  Lodge.  Sam  Roberts  was  a  member of  the  Douglas  County  Development  Authority and  the  Douglas  Chamber  of  Commerce.  He was  also  a  youth  football  coach  for  20  years. Sam Roberts  received  numerous  community and  civic  awards,  such  as  Who\u2019s  Who  in Georgia,  and  Small  Business  Person  of  the Year  from  the  Douglas  County  Chamber  of Commerce.  He  was  also  Associate  of  the Year  of  the  Douglas  County  Home  Builders Association.  Sam  was  admitted  to  the Carrollton  Trojan  Hall  of  Fame,  and  was  a Jaycees  International Senator. While  serving  in  the  Georgia  State  Senate, Sam  Roberts  worked  extremely  hard  for  swift and  strong  punishment  of  criminals,  to  improve  education  for  children,  and  to  make  our state  government  more  efficient.  Before  he passed  away,  he  had  introduced  Senate  Bill 69,  which  was  pushed  through  by  lawmakers as  a  tribute  to  Sam  Roberts.  The  bill  dispels the  need  to  carry  an  insurance  card  to  prove coverage  and  allows  for  computerized  records of  coverage and  renewals. Sam  Roberts  was  a  resident  of  Douglas County  for  more  than  30  years.  He  was  a member  of  Heritage  Baptist  Church,  with  his wife,  Sue.  Sam  is  also  survived  by  three  children\u2014Sherrie, Beau, and Amber. Mr.  Speaker,  the  career  of  Senator  Sam Roberts\u2014as  a  professional,  as  a  legislator,  as a  community  leader,  and  as  a  family  man\u2014 clearly demonstrates why we  should name  this Post  Office  in  his  community,  in  his  honor.  I ask  you  and  my  colleagues  to  join  me  in  renaming  the  U.S.  Post  Office  in  Carrollton, Georgia, after  the Honorable Sam Roberts. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 29, 2000 Mr.  LAZIO.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  to  introduce the  bill  entitled  the  Breast  Cancer  Research Stamps Reauthorization Act of 2000. Breast  cancer  is  the  most  commonly  diagnosed  cancer  among  women  in  the  United States.  More  than  2  million  American  women are  currently  living  with  the  disease,  1  million of  whom  have  yet  to  be  diagnosed.  This  year alone,  182,800  women  will  be  diagnosed  with breast  cancer.  Over  40,000  of  them  will  lose their battle with  this  killer. Breast  cancer  has  taken  an  awful  toll  on  the people  of  my  home  state.  New  York  has  the second-highest  breast  cancer  mortality  rate  in the  country.  Between  1980  and  1994,  the  incidence  of  breast  cancer  in  New  York  increased nearly 18 percent. Enactment of  this bill will go a  long  way  toward  helping  our  effort  to  increase  funding  for  breast  cancer  research. Only  through  the  help  of  continued  cancer  research  have  more  and  more  people  become cancer  survivors  in  recent  years. Since  the  issuance  of  the  Breast  Cancer Research  stamp  in  the  summer  of  1998,  164 million  Breast  Cancer  Research  stamps  have been  sold  raising  over  $12  million  for  breast cancer  research.  The  stamp  provides  a  convenient  avenue  for  participation  in  the  battle against  this  horrible  disease.  Unfortunately, without  congressional  intervention,  the  stamp will expire on  July 28, 2000. Valuable  research funds,  as  well  as  a  mechanism  to  heighten public  awareness  of  this  horrible  disease,  will be  lost. This  bill,  The  Breast  Cancer  Research Stamp  Reauthorization  Act  of  2000  would  extend  the  sale  of  the  Breast  Cancer  Research stamp  for  an  additional  two  years.  The  stamp would  continue  to  cost  40  cents  and  sell  as  a first  class  stamp.  The  additional  funds  that  are raised  will  go  directly  to  breast  cancer  research  at  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  and the Department of Defense. I  am  pleased  to  report  that  this  reauthorization  bill  has  tremendous  support  throughout the  health  community.  Supporters  of  the Breast  Cancer  Stamp  Reauthorization  Act  of 2000  include  the  American  Cancer  Society, the  American  Medical  Association,  the  Y-Me National  Breast  Cancer  Organization,  Leadership  America,  the  National  Association  of Women\u2019s  Health,  the  American  Cancer League,  the  American  College  of  Surgeons, Friends  of  Cancer  Research,  and  many  others. A  Breast  Cancer  Research  Stamp  remains just  as  necessary  today  as  it  was  when  this authority  was  signed  into  law  two  years  ago. According  to  the  American  Association  for Cancer  Research,  8  million  people  are  alive today  as  a  result  of  cancer  research.  To  say that  every  dollar  we  continue  to  raise  will  save lives,  can  only  underscore  the  importance  of this  legislation. I  urge  my  colleagues  to  this  important  legislation. enacting join  me  in  VerDate 11<MAY>2000 06:13 Jul 01, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A29JN8.028 pfrm03 PsN: E30PT1 ",

Minnesota  counties\u2019  capitation payments are alarmingly low when compared  with  the  capitation  payment  rates  of counties  in  other  states,  and  its  ACRs  have remained static. As a consequence, access by Minnesota  seniors  and  Minnesota\u2019s  enrollment rates in Medicare+Choice are adversely and disproportionately affected. In  1997,  every  county  in  Minnesota  had  an AAPCC  rate  below  the  national  average AAPCC  rate.  In  1999,  despite  the  BBA  reforms,  little  changed.  The  capitation  payment  rate  in  Dakota  County  was  $394.42, while  the  payment  rate  in  Broward  County, Florida,  was  $676.64.  (See  Appendix  A;  see also Section III, infra.) A. DISPARATE CAPITATION PAYMENTS B. DISPARATE EFFECTS OF THE ACR MECHANISM The  disparity  of  capitation  payment  rates for Minnesota and other states is striking. In 1997,  the  reimbursement  rate  for  Dakota County,  Minnesota  was  $379.11;  in  Hennepin County,  Minnesota,  the  rate  was  $405.63.  In 1997,  the  reimbursement  rate  for  Richmond County, New York, was $767.35, while in Dade County, Florida, the AAPCC rate was $748.23. In  addition,  because  of  its  historic  efficiency,  Minnesota\u2019s  ACRs  have  remained static.  Consequently,  the  difference  between Minnesota\u2019s  low capitation payments and  its static ACRs is minimal or non-existent. Conversely,  other  states  with  recently  improved efficiency have experienced falling ACRs, enabling  them  to  enjoy  large  required  benefit values  as  a  result  of  their  high  capitation payments  and  low  ACRs.  The  result  is  that different  managed  care  plans  in  different states  have  different  incentives  with  regard to  non-covered  benefits.  In  Minnesota,  seniors  face  high  Medicare  premiums  and  copays and receive few or no non-covered benefits, while other states\u2019 citizens enjoy a multitude  of  life-saving  and  life-improving  noncovered  benefits  with  few  or  no  extra  payments. Nowhere  is  this more obvious  than  in coverage for prescription drugs.

Except  for  injectable  insulin,  the Minnesota  beneficiary  pays  all  costs  for  all outpatient  prescription  drugs,  while  the Florida  beneficiary  pays  nothing  for  a  full outpatient  prescription  drug  benefit.  The Minnesota  beneficiary  pays  20%  for  out-ofarea  ambulance  transportation,  while  the Florida  beneficiary  pays  nothing  for  such transportation.  The  Minnesota  beneficiary pays  a  $10  co-pay  for  each  individual  outpatient  mental  health  session,  while  the Florida  beneficiary  pays  nothing  for  each session.  The  Minnesota  beneficiary  pays  a $30  co-pay  for  emergency  services,  while  the Florida  beneficiary  pays  nothing  for  such services.

(see  Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint, paragraphs 32\u201340.) C. EFFECTS ON ACCESS AND ENROLLMENT The  disparate  effects  of Medicare+Choice\u2019s reimbursement  system  have  adversely  affected  Minnesotans\u2019  access  to  and  enrollment  in  participating  risk  payment  plans. Minnesota  health  plans  have  entirely  withdrawn  from  or  declined  to  participate  in  the Medicare+Choice  program,  have  withdrawn from  offering  such  plans  in  various  counties in Minnesota, or have suffered a reduction in the  available  networks  of  health  care  providers  that  provide  medical  services  to  enrollees.  Currently,  only  three  health  plans offer  Medicare+Choice  plans  to  seniors  in Minnesota\u2014and  this  figure  represents  a  reduction  from  the  previous  figure  of  four. Such  limited  Medicare+Choice  plans  are available  almost  exclusively  in  the  counties of  the  Minneapolis-St.  Paul  metropolitan area and are not generally available to beneficiaries  in  rural  Minnesota  counties.  (Refer to Table  I  for a  list of the number of participating  plans  by  state  or  metropolitan  area.) III. POLITICAL AND LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN INADEQUATE Legislative  and  political  solutions  to  Minnesota\u2019s  low  capitation  payments  have  been largely  unsuccessful.  From  its  inception, AAPCCs  were  based  on  arbitrary  tabulations, and early demonstration projects  indicated  that  the  payment  methodology  was problematic.  Furthermore,  when  legislative relief  came  in  1997,  the  BBA  failed  to  adequately ameliorate payment disparities. A. EARLY HISTORY From the first risk-contracting demonstration  projects  in  the  late  1970s,  it  was  clear that  the  method  of  reimbursement  was flawed  for  use  in  rural-  and  conservativepractice areas. Risk contracting was first authorized in 1972, but due to poor provider participation,  the  Health  Care  Financing  Administration  (HCFA)  solicited  applications for  new  models  for  capitated  payments  in 1978.  Five  demonstration  projects  resulted, one  of  which,  the  Greater  Marshfield  (Wisconsin) Community Health Plan, was located in a rural area. Reimbursement  rates  for  all  five  projects were  established  at  95%  of  the  average  FFS costs  for  the  counties  involved  in  the  demonstration, a schedule that became known as the AAPCC. This value of 95% of the average FFS  was  arbitrarily  chosen  and  is  not  substantiated  by  research  that  would  show  this value  represents  an  expected  savings  from coordination  of  care.  The  formula  has  failed to  provide  all  Medicare  beneficiaries  equal access to the Medicare+Choice option. Though  Marshfield  succeeded  in  reducing utilization  of  services  by  nearly  10  percent over  the  course  of  the  demonstration  the total  loss  for  the  plan  and  its  sponsors  was over  $3  million.  With  these  losses  in  mind, the  HCFA  terminated  the  Marshfield  demonstration. Marshfield  responded  by  requesting  experimentation  with  the  AAPCC  to  see if  some  alternative  or  variation  could  more accurately  predict  cost.  The  HCFA  rejected this suggestion without explanation. In  the  early  and  mid-1980s,  more  demonstrations  were  established.  Plans  in  the Twin  Cities  of  Minnesota  provided  additional,  non-covered  benefits,  such  as  outpatient prescription drugs, and competed aggressively for enrollment. Enrollment in risk products grew dramatically, to a peak of 60% of  the  Twin  Cities  metro  area\u2019s  senior  population  by  1986\u201387.  Nationally,  in  fiscal  year 1986,  $1.3  billion  was  reimbursed  to  142  risk contractors  who  provided  care  to  nearly 75,000 beneficiaries. In  response  to  market  interest,  several plans  expanded  their  Medicare  risk  service areas  to  rural  counties,  assuming  that  lower AAPCCs  in  those  counties  would  correlate with  lower  cost  to  serve  a  rural  population. However,  the  reverse  proved  to  be  true  and seniors  flocked  to  the  plans\u2019  comprehensive coverage  with  significant  pent  up  demand. After  a  couple  years  of  significant  losses, most  of  the  plans withdrew  from  rural  counties, and again, the payment structure  failed beneficiaries in rural areas. The  mid-  and  late-1980s  saw  several  years of  no  increase  in  the  AAPCCs,  with  payments  actually  falling  in  at  least  one  year. As  a  result,  health  maintenance  organizations (HMOs) which had long-since pulled out of  rural  areas  began  to  reduce  benefits  and significantly  raise  member  premiums.  Enrollees  began  to  pay  more  and  more  of  the cost  of  the  added  benefits  through  their  premiums. Increasing numbers of seniors moved to  lower  option  risk  products  without  prescription  drug  coverage  as  the  higher  option products  became  unaffordable  for  many. Even  with  significant  member  cost-sharing, many  of  the  HMOs  experienced  marked losses  and  began  exiting  the  risk  contract business. Analysis  by  the  Physician  Payment  Review  Commission  in  1997  shows  that  in  June 1997, 33% of all Medicare beneficiaries lacked VerDate 11<MAY>2000 06:13 Jul 01, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A29JN8.052 pfrm03 PsN: E30PT1 ",

This  February  many  of my  constituents  were  placed  into  a  special hazard  flood  zone,  a  designation which  necessitated  the  purchase  of  flood  insurance.  These residents  were  not  notified  that  they  would  be required  to  purchase  flood  insurance  until  two months or  less before  the maps became effective,  even  though  the  law  is  supposed  to  give them  six  months  notice.  This  exacerbated  an already difficult  situation, as  residents who had not  seen  flooding  in  decades  or  a  lifetime  had little notice  to purchase  costly  insurance. Several  residents  who  did  not  believe  they were  in  the  flood  zone  hired  a  surveyor  at their  own  expense.  The  data  provided  by  this private  surveyor  resulted  in  their  homes  being removed  from  the  special  hazard  flood  zone. While  these  residents  were  not  required  to purchase  flood  insurance,  they  did  spend  over $200  each  for  the  surveyor.  They  were  told  by FEMA  that  they  were  responsible  for  that  expense,  even  though  the  mistaken  flood  zone classification  was  made  by  the  county  engineers. Clearly  the  national  flood  insurance  program needs  to  be  revised  to  give  homeowners more notice  and  due  process.  That\u2019s  why  I  am  proposing  this  legislation. The  National  Flood  Insurance  Program  Fairness  Act  of  2000  would  do  the  following:  Require  the  FEMA Director  to  notify  by  registered mail  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  each  community affected by  changes  in Flood  Insurance Rate  Maps.  The  Director  will  be  required  to provide  a  copy  of  the  revised  map,  along  with a  statement  explaining  the  process  of  appeal. The  director  will  also  provide  the  affected community  sufficient  information  to  identify which  homes  are  affected.  Require  the  Director  to  notify  by  registered  mail  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  each  community  of  FEMA\u2019s  response  to  the  community\u2019s  appeal  of  the  flood insurance  rate  maps.  Require  the  Director  to notify  by  first  class  mail  each  owner  of  property  affected  by  the  changes  in  the  flood  insurance  rate  maps.  Require  FEMA  to  reimburse a  resident  for  reasonable  costs  incurred  in connection  with  a  surveyor  or  engineer  for  an appeal  to  the  Director  which  is  successful. This  does  not  include  legal  services  incurred by  the  resident. It  is  my  hope  that  the  legislation  will  allow communities  to  better  work  with  FEMA  to  ensure  that  residents  are  given  sufficient,  fair, and  timely  notice  if  they  will  be  required  to purchase  flood  insurance. f PERSONAL  EXPLANATION HON.

Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  recognize  and  honor  forty American  soldiers  killed  over  fifty-seven  years ago  in  a  terrible  aviation  accident.  This mishap occurred  in  Bakers  Creek,  Queensland,  Australia  on  14  June  1943.  At  the  time,  it  was  not only  the  worst  aviation  accident  in  Australia, but  also  the  worst  aviation  accident  of  World War  II.

Mr.  Speaker,  although  these  men  came from  twenty  different  states,  were  from  many different  walks  of  life,  and  served  in  many  different  units,  their  common  purpose  was  one: service  to  our  nation.  Until  recently,  the  details of  this  mishap  were  classified  by  the  Air Force,  but  now  that  the  incident  is  available for  public  attention,  I  desire  to  honor  the memory of  these  fine  young men. I  applaud  the  efforts  of  people  like  Mr.  Colin Benson,  who  is  a  historian  for  the  Mackay chapter  of  the  Returned  and  Service  League (RSL)  of  Australia.  Mr.  Benson\u2019s  devotion  to obtaining  the  records  of  the  incident  and  seeking  recognition  for  these  men  has  been  long and  arduous.  As  an  Australian,  Mr.  Benson\u2019s dedication  to  our  American  soldiers  is  commendable.  Rarely  does  a  foreign  country  applaud  the  efforts  and  sacrifices  of  another,  and strive  so  hard  to  honor  their  dead.  I  also  applaud  Mr.  Eugene  D.  Rossel\u2019s  commitment and  dedication  to  the  disclosure  of  this  terrible mishap.  He  is  that  type  of  American  who  will not  rest  until  heroes  like  the  men  I  listed above  are  recognized  for  their  personal  sacrifice. Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask  that we  give  thanks  to  all our  veterans  for  the  sacrifices  they  made  for our  great  nation.  Unfortunately,  we  must  also live  with  the  knowledge  that  some  of  our  servicemen  and  women  do  not  live  long  enough  to become  veterans.  They  give  their  lives  so  that ours  might  be  better,  and  the  men  of  B\u201317 40\u20132071  did  no  less.  May  we  continue  to  recognize  and  memorialize  our  fallen  servicemen and women,  long  into  the  future. f CONGRATULATING  ERS  OF  SHADY  TARY  SCHOOL 30  SIXTH  GRADLANE  ELEMENHON.

The  gentleman  reserves  a  point  of  order  on  the  amendment. The gentleman  from New Jersey  (Mr. is  recognized  for  5  minutes  on his amendment. Mr.  PAYNE.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr.  Chairman,  my  amendment, which would  be  included  in  section  534, would add to the list of countries, \u2018\u2018any country  doing  business  with  UNITA  in Angola.\u2019\u2019 As  my  colleagues  may  know,  UNITA is an organization  that was  formed and supported  during  the  Cold  War,  and  it is  an  organization  that  is  supported and  run  by  Jonas  Savimbi,  who  during the  end  of  the  Cold  War  agreements were  made  with  President  dos  Santos from  the  government  and  UNITA  that an  election  should  be  held. An  election was  held  and  Mr.  dos  Santos  was  the victor of the election. There  was  supposed  to  then  be  a turning  in  of  weapons  from  UNITA. They were  then  supposed  to  take political seats in the government of Angola, but  they  have  refused  to  stop  the  war. They  have  killed  peacekeepers  from the  United  Nations;  shot  down  two planes,  which  ended  up  in  the  loss  of life;  and  also  Jonas  Savimbi  is  dealing in  illegal  diamond  sales,  similar  to  the RUF in Sierra Leone. We  must  stop  the  sale  of  illegal  diamonds, whether  it  is the brutal RUF  in Sierra  Leone,  who  broke  the  Lome Peace  Accords,  and  we  feel  that  now those  persons,  Foday  Sankoh  and  the rest  who  broke  the  accords  should stand trial, or  in Angola, where UNITA continues  to  wreak  havoc  on  that country. They have become  involved  in the conflict  in  the Congo which has  six other countries involved. They are continuing  to  refuse  to  go  along with  continued United Nations sanctions. So  we  believe  that  the  same  countries  that are  in  this bill, and  that  this amendment  deals  with,  should  be  prohibited  from  having  any  funds  for  the governments  of  any  country  that  supports  UNITA.  As  I  have  indicated, there  has  been  an  appeal  to  Jonas Savimbi  to  lay  down  the  arms,  to  give his  arms  up  and  to  allow  the  people  of Angola  a  peace  for  the  first  time  in many,  many  years,  where  a  civil  war went on until 1974 when the Portuguese troops  withdrew  from  Angola  and  the country  then  became  independent.  But since that time, the UNITA forces were supported  by  the  United  States  Government,  like  the  government  of  Zaire with  Mr.  Mobutu,  another  brutal  dictator. And once again these are the legacies of the Cold War. I think that we have a responsibility, since  we  had  so  much  to  do  with  the creation of these despots and these dictators and  these brutal  leaders,  to help undo  what  we  have  done.  What  was done  was  felt  was  in  the  best  interest of  democracy  and  our  foreign  needs, but  now  that  that  Cold  War  is  over,  I think  we  have  an  adequate  responsibility  to  attempt  to  undo.  So  I  would I  the  balance reserve  hope that this amendment would be accepted. As I have indicated, it is simply asking that UNITA, the corporation, be added  to  the  list  of  these  other  pariah countries  of  Iraq  and  others  that  are included  in  this  section,  and  that  it would  prohibit  any  funds  for  the  government  of  any  country  that  supports UNITA. Mr.  Chairman,  of my time. Mr.  CALLAHAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I yield  myself  such  time  as  I  may  consume;  and  I  would  suggest,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  the  gentleman  from  New Jersey  talk  with  the  chairman  of  the authorizing  committee, who  is  here,  to strike  a  section  of  the  bill  that  is  authorization  on  an  appropriations  bill that is inappropriate. If  the  gentleman  would  wish  to  continue,  I  will  be  happy  to  withhold  my point of order to allow him to finish his statement. Mr.  PAYNE.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield myself  the  balance  of  my  time  and would just conclude by once again reiterating  that  we  should  prohibit  funds to  any  country  that  supports  UNITA. They  are  working  against  the  best  interests  of  the  people  of  that  country. They said that they would turn in their weapons,  they  said  that  they  would stop  the  illicit  selling  of  diamonds, which  they  have  not,  and  they  have continued to wreak havoc. Mr.  Chairman,  there  are  more  land mines  in  Angola  than  any  other  country in the world. There are more amputees  per  person  than  in  any  country  in the  world.  Farmers  cannot  farm,  children  cannot  play,  vehicles  cannot  ride because  of  the  continued  business  of UNITA.  Illegal  diamonds  are  continuing to be sold. So  I  think  it  is  a  very humane  and  I  would  ask  the  gentleman  consider his opposition. point, to  rePOINT OF ORDER PAYNE)  Mr.  CALLAHAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I make  a  point  of  order  against  the amendment  because  it  proposes  to change  existing  law  and  constitutes legislation on an appropriation bill and therefore  violates  clause  2  of  rule  XXI. The  rule  states  in  pertinent  part: \u2018\u2018An  amendment  to  a  general  appropriation bill  shall not be made  in order if changing existing law\u2019\u2019 applies. I ask for the ruling of the Chair. The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from  New  Jersey  (Mr.  wish  to be heard on the point of order? Mr. PAYNE. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  ask  that  the gentleman  reconsider  his  point  of order.  I  believe  that  this  is  in  keeping with  what  we  have  in  this  section  of the legislation. But in addition to that, I  think  it  is only  the  right  thing  to do. As  we  have  indicated,  people  controlled by UNITA\u2019s area are selling diamonds,  creating  havoc;  and  I  think that if the gentleman would reconsider, this  should  be  inserted.  It  is  not  actually legislating; it is simply stating the sense  of  what  is  right  should  be  included and was overlooked. is  preThe  Chair  The  CHAIRMAN.  pared to rule. Section  534  constitutes  a  legislative provision  permitted  to  remain  in  the bill  by  waiver  in  House  Resolution  546. A  germane  amendment  merely  perfecting section 534 may be in order. The instant  amendment,  however,  by  proposing  to  cover  an  additional nation  in the  legislative  prescription  in  section 534, would  insert additional  legislation. The  amendment  is  not  merely  perfecting.  As  such,  it  constitutes  further legislation  in violation of clause 2(c) of rule XXI,  and  the  point  of  order  is  sustained. If  there  are  no  further  amendments to  this  section,  the Clerk will  continue to read. The Clerk read as follows: AUTHORITIES FOR THE PEACE CORPS,  INTERDEVELNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL OPMENT,  INTER-AMERICAN FOUNDATION AND AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION SEC.  535.

The  Chair  recognizes  the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE). Mr.  PAYNE.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield myself  such  time  as  I  may  consume.  I have  an  amendment  on what  I  think  is probably  one  of  the  most  horrendous situations  that  has  occurred  for  the past  40 years  in a country  that was  the first  African  country  to  receive  its independence back in 1956 from Britain. It is the country of Sudan. The country of  Sudan  has  seen  an  estimated  2  million people die from famine and war-related  issues.  In  1998  alone,  100,000  people  died  because  the  National  Islamic Front  government  denied  United  Nations humanitarian food to be delivered to  the  needy  people  in  the  south  of Sudan. More  people  have  died  in  Sudan  than in  Bosnia, Kosovo,  Somalia,  and  Congo combined.  We  have  seen  food  being  deprived  from  people.  We  have  seen  the fact  that  the  Antonovs,  which  are  old Soviet  planes,  fly  over  communities.  I was there several times where we actually  would  watch  the  chickens  because the  chickens  would  hear  the  planes from  long  distances  and  the  children would  then  run  when  the  chickens started  to  move  around  and  then  the older  people  would  know  that  the planes  are  coming,  the  bombs  are  coming,  you  try  to  get  out  of  it.  It  is  one of the most horrendous situations. Two million people. All  we  are  asking  is  that  there  be nonlethal  equipment,  that  the  people be  allowed  to  have  food,  that  they could  protect  themselves  from  the  aerial  bombings,  that  they  could  have some  semblance  of  order.  The  fact  is that  this  would  go  to  the  National Democratic  Alliance  which  is  made  up of  the  people  in  the  south  who  are  in the process of trying to move along. At  this  time  we  have  a  technical  difference.  I  understand  that  we  are  on the  other  section.  So  we  would  ask that  the  Clerk  would  once  again  read the title. ",

Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise in  strong  support  of  the  Lowey-Greenwood  motion  to  strike  section  587,  relating  to  the  global  gag  rule  and  limiting  vital  U.S.  assistance  for  voluntary international family planning. I  am  a  firm  believer  in  voluntary international  family  planning.  Let  me make  this  clear.  International  family planning  prevents  abortions.  I  do  not think anyone can dispute that. The  global  gag  rule  is  dangerous  because  it  prevents  U.S.  funds  from reaching  critical  health  care  providers in  developing  nations  and  dictates  how these NGOs can spend  funds  from other donors  besides  the  U.S.  government. We  have  every  right  to  decide  policy for  U.S.  funds,  but  not  for  other  nations  and  private  donors.  In  fact,  no U.S.  dollars  can  be  used  to  perform abortions overseas. Mr. Chairman,  I support this prohibition.  It  is  up  to  the  governments  and citizens in these nations to decide their own  policies.  In  Malawi,  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  which  I  recently  visited,  I witnessed  how  villagers  from  miles around used one central health care  facility  for  all  of  their  needs.  These  people have no options. If  the  U.S.  fails  to  fund  them,  they cannot  use  the  hospital  down  the  road. This  is  literally  one-stop  health  care shopping  with  no  alternatives.  If  it  is not  funded,  women  will  have  no  access to  contraception  or  any  other  health care and neither will their families. Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  also  opposed  to the  global  gag  rule  because  it  is  patently  undemocratic.  If  such  restrictions  were  placed  on  NGOs  here,  they would  be  a  clear  violation  of  the  first amendment. How  can  we  claim  to  export  democracy  when  we  export  limitations  on free  speech?  Mr.  Chairman,  this  is  no compromise.  This  is  legislation  placed into  an  appropriations  measure,  despite the Republican  leadership\u2019s claim that  they  would  accept  no  controversial riders. Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  the  number  of Members  on  the  floor  today  clearly demonstrates  the  controversy  surrounding  this  issue.  And  to  call  it  a compromise when  it  took  holding  vital U.N.  funding  hostage,  placing  U.S.  national  security  at  risk  to  get  the  administration  to  let  it  in  is  disingenuous, misleading and downright preposterous. Mr.  Chairman,  I  to  support  the  amendment. urge  my  colleagues Lowey-Greenwood b 1100 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman,  I  yield  33\u20444 minutes  to  the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. WELDON). Mr.  WELDON  of  Florida.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  the  gentleman  from  New Jersey for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition  to  this  amendment  and  any amendment  that  would  strike  the agreed-upon  language  in  section  587  of the  Foreign  Operations  appropriations bill. Last fall, for the first time during his term,  the  President  signed  legislation to  restrict  the  use  of  United  States taxpayer  dollars  to  groups  that  perform  or  promote  abortions  overseas. This  version  of  the  so-called  \u2018\u2018Mexico City  policy\u2019\u2019  allowed  no  more  than  $15 million of United States population assistance  funds  to  go  to  foreign  organizations  that  promote  or  perform  abortions overseas. This  amendment  proposed  today would  strip  that  language  that  the President signed  into  law  last year and allow  almost  unlimited  United  States taxpayer  subsidies  of  the  international abortion industry. Now,  I  know  my  colleagues  on  the other  side  are  fond  of  saying  that  no United  States  dollar  goes  to  that  purpose, but as we all know,  that  is an accounting  maneuver.  This  is  just  another attempt by the pro-abortion side, I  believe,  to  promote  their  agenda  and to  create,  furthermore,  gridlock  over this  contentious  issue  of  funding  for international  abortion-related  organizations. The  language  that  this  amendment seeks  to  strike  was  agreed  upon  by both  sides  last  year  to  resolve  a  stalemate.  Unfortunately,  the  pro-abortiion side  is  unwilling  to  accept  anything other than a total victory for the international abortion industry. What  my  colleagues  will  not  acknowledge  is  that  section  587  does  not weaken  international  family  planning programs.  Rather,  it  strengthens  them by  ensuring  that  United  States  funds are  directed  to  those  groups  that  provide  family  planning  but  not  to  those who  perform  abortions  or  promote abortion as a form of birth control. Furthermore,  it  would  restrict  funding  to  those  organizations  that  seek  to overturn the pro-life  laws of more than 100  countries  overseas,  clearly  something  that  the  vast  majority  of  United States  taxpayers  do  not  want  to  see their taxpayer funds being used for. Abortion is not birth control, and the taxpayers  should  not  be  forced  to  pay for it. This  is  a  bad  amendment,  and  I  encourage  my  colleagues  to  vote  against it  and  any  other  amendment  that threatens the language now included in the  Foreign  Operations  appropriations bill. It has been said that some of the people  on  this  side  of  this  argument  are motivated  primarily  by  religious  arguments.  As  a  physician  who  has  personally  witnessed  an  abortion,  I  do  not know how  anybody  could  support  abortion  after  actually  seeing  one  with their  eyes.  I do not  think  this  is a  religious debate. It is certainly a moral debate.  It  is  certainly  a  debate  about what  is  the  appropriate  use  of  United States  taxpayer  dollars  when  one  considers  that  millions  of  Americans  feel very  strongly  that  abortion  is  murder, that this is a very, very reasonable policy  for  us  to  have  in  the  bill,  and  that it  is  very  inappropriate  for  it  to  be overturned. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, striking this  language  would  be  a  victory  for women  and  children  and  democracy around the world. Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  pleased  to  yield 1  minute  to  the  gentlewoman  from California  (Ms.  LEE),  a  fighter  for  democracy. Ms. LEE. Mr.  Chairman,  first,  let me just  thank  the  gentlewoman  from  New York  for  yielding me  this  time  and  for her  strong  leadership  on  behalf  of  the families throughout the world. Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  in  strong  support of this amendment today to strike the global gag rule which denies United States  family  planning  assistance  to any  overseas  organization  that uses  its own non-United States funds to provide abortion  services  or  reproductive choice advocacy. Approximately  600,000  women  die each  year  from  preventable  complications  related  to  pregnancy  and  childbirth.  Complications  are  the  leading cause  of  death  and  disability  among women  between  the  ages  of  15  to  49  in developing countries. Now,  most  of  these  women  are  poor, and many have infectious diseases such as HIV or AIDS and are  struggling  just to survive day by day. Now,  this  amendment  does  not  require  United  States  foreign  aid  funds to  be  used  for  abortions.  Women throughout  the  world  should  have  fundamental  access  to  health  care  and family  planning  services  and  health education. Support  for  this  amendment  means saving  lives,  promoting  women\u2019s  and children\u2019s  health.  To  do  less  is  fundamentally  undemocratic  and  morally wrong. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair would inform  Members  that  the  gentleman from  New  Jersey  (Mr.  has  101\u20444 minutes  remaining.  The  gentleman from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.  has  21\u20442 minutes  remaining. The  woman  from  New  York  (Mrs.  has  5  minutes  remaining.  The  gentleman  from Pennsylvania  (Mr. GREENWOOD) has the right to close debate. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman,  I  yield  3  minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  South  Carolina  (Mr. DEMINT). Mr. DEMINT. Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  in opposition  to  this  amendment,  which would  undermine  the  values  in  human rights in other countries. Our  current  law  is  designed  to  prevent taxpayer  funds  from being used to undermine  the  values  of  foreign  families  by  subsidizing  organizations  which work  to  undermine  pro-life  laws  that are  already  in  place.  This  proposed amendment  would  change  this  good law. As  legislators,  we  have  the  tremendous  responsibility  of  being  in  charge of other people\u2019s money. The dollars we spend do not belong to us. They are the result  of  hard  work  of  people  throughout  this  land.  How  we  spend  these  dollars  is  a  decision  which  is  entrusted  to us  with  the  effects  reaching  all  around the globe. GREENWOOD) SMITH)  gentleLOWEY) ",

Yes,  they  took  up  arms  in the  face  of  naked  aggression  from  Serb  paramilitary  and  security  forces.  Faced  with  similar situations,  I  doubt  many  in  this  Chamber wouldn\u2019t  do  the  same  to  protect  their  homes, their  families  and  loved  ones.  The  war  is  now over,  and  it  is  essential  that  we  support  programs  such  as  this  which,  in  a  very  real sense,  beat  swords  into  plowshares  by transitioning  these  veterans  to  the  cause  of community  service and nation building. That  cause  would  be  undercut,  Mr.  Chairman,  if  we  allow  this  amendment  to  prevail. Let\u2019s  not  destroy  a  worthwhile  program  and jeopardize  the  cause  of  peace  because  of  the misdeeds  of  a  few.  I  urge  my  colleagues  to oppose  the Kucinich Amendment. Mr.  NADLER.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  today  to oppose  the  Kucinich  Amendment  to  cut  funding  for  the  Kosovo  Protection  Corps  (KPC). The  KPC  has  served  as  an  important  force  for peace  and  stability  in  an  unstable  region.  After the  Kosovo  Liberation  Army  (KLA)  demilitarized,  the  KPC  was  formed  in  an  effort  to employ  former  KLA  members  in  a  capacity which  could  be  beneficial  to  the  region.  Since it\u2019s  inception,  the  KPC  has  done  important work  in Kosovo,  cleaning  disease  infested  garbage  dumps  in  Pristina,  repairing  roads  and bridges  and  helping  to  rebuild  over  1,000 homes. While  individual  members  of  the  KPC  have been  accused  of  carrying  illegal  weapons,  and while  I  do  believe  these  individuals  should  be dealt  with,  the  KPC  as  a  whole  has  played  an important  role  in  the  quest  for  peace  in Kosovo.  On  February  4th,  in  Mitrovica,  KPC members  intervened  along  with  French  and Italian  NATO  peacekeepers  to  disperse  an angry  crowd.  The  leadership  of  the  KPC  has repeatedly  spoken  out  for  tolerance  and  reconciliation  amongst  the  different  ethnic  groups within  the  region. Mr.  Speaker,  I  believe  it  would  be  a  grave mistake  to  deny  funding  to  this  important  organization  at  this  most  tumultuous  time  in Kosovo\u2019s  history.  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  vote against  the Kucinich amendment. Mr.  BONIOR.  Mr.  Chairman,  it  was  picture early  last  year  in  the Balkans. Slobodan  Milosevic  had  begun  a  new  campaign  of  terror  against  ethnic  Albanians  in Kosovo. Men of all ages were  Women were  raped. Yet  another  ethnic  \u2018\u2018ethnically  cleansed.\u2019\u2019 Refugees  poured  over  nia and Macedonia. When  I  visited  the  refugees  last  May,  they relayed  experiences  that  few  of  us  could  even imagine are possible  in  the world  today. One  Kosovar  boy  saw  his  father\u2019s  eyes  torn out.  He  told  us,  \u2018\u2018you  can\u2019t  imagine  what  they have done.\u2019\u2019 A  woman  from  the  Prizren  region  said  that Serb  paramilitary  forces  entered  her  house, looking  for  her  husband\u2014a  teacher  in  a  local school.  The  forces  took  all  of  the  family\u2019s  jewelry  and  money.  She  escaped,  but  her  husband  and  mother  were  burned  alive  inside  the house.  The  woman  said,  \u2018\u2018this  happened  to many people.\u2019\u2019 tortured and  population  borders  killed. being bleak Albawas  the  to  a  in These  are  brutal  episodes,  but  too  many  of us  have  become  numb  to  them  because  in Milosevic\u2019s  Yugoslavia  last  decade,  we learned  of  violence  like  this  nearly  every  day. But  I  know  that  for  many  of  us,  and  for many  of  our  parents  and  grandparents,  these stories  bring  back  chilling  memories  of  Europe during  the Nazi  reign of  terror. Last  spring,  we  could  have  struck  our  head deep  into  the  sand,  and  said  that  Kosovo  was merely a European problem, but we didn\u2019t. Together  with  NATO,  we  mounted  a  swift and  successful  campaign  to  put  an  end  to  this awful bloodshed and mayhem. Although  Kosovo  has  a  long  way  to  go  after a  generation  of  ethnic  tension,  years  of  neglect  and  months  of  war,  things  are  getting better day after day. Democracy,  the  rule  of  law  and  prosperity do  not  take  root  overnight.  They  must  be  nurtured. But with  care,  they will grow. That\u2019s  why  we  must  reject  this  amendment. It  will  do  nothing  more  than  uproot  the  careful  work  we  have  done  so  far  in  the  Balkans. The  people  of  Kosovo  are  dedicated  to  democracy,  and  I  know  they  draw  their  strength from  the  commitment  we  in  the  United  States have made  to  them. The  army  fighting  for  independence  Kosovo  last  year  voluntarily disarmed. According  to  the  State  Department,  this  demilitarization  was  the  quickest  in  modern  history. And  the  new  force\u2014known  as  the  Kosovo Protection  Corps\u2014which  this  amendment seeks  to  disband,  has  helped  to  rebuild homes,  fight  fires,  repair  the  infrastructure  and clean polluted  rivers. Yes,  there  have  been  incidents  where  individuals  have  engaged  in  abuses.  And  these must be dealt with  severely. In  any  country  where  chaos  has  ruled  and war  has  ravaged  civic  institutions,  there  is bound  to  be  confusion.  Tensions  which  are ages old will not be diffused overnight. We  should  not  underestimate  the  problems. But  the  answer  is  not  to  walk  away  from  the problems. The  answer  peace. And  that\u2019s  Kosovo. Vote against  this amendment. Mr.  CROWLEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  speak today  in  strong  opposition  to  the  Kucinich amendment  which  seeks  to  prohibit  funds  in the  FY  2001  Foreign  Operations  Appropriations  bill  from  being  used  to  fund  the  Kosova Protection Corps  (KPC). KPC  plays  a  vital  role  in  Kosova,  filling  the void  that  was  left  when  the  Kosova  Liberation Army  (KLA)  surrendered  its weapons. The KPC was  formed  by  the UN Administration  in  Kosova  (UNMIK)  as  a  civilian  organization  responsible  for  disaster  response,  search and  rescue,  humanitarian  assistance, demining,  and  infrastructure  rebuilding.  Security  in  Kosova  is  not  provided  by  the  KPC,  but a  separately  trained  civilian  police  and  international  police  force  serving  under  the  direction  of  UNMIK.  The  KPC  functions  under  the political authority of UNMIK and  the day-to-day operational direction of KFOR. The  KPC  carries  out  important  civilian  work projects,  such  as  building  and  repairing  roads and  bridges.  In  another  instance,  the  KPC  intervened  on  February  4  when  French  and Italian  NATO  peacekeepers  were  not  able  to continue  exactly  should  what  work  we  do  for to  to  is  in in  resucceeded  disperse  an  angry  crowd  and  storing order  to  the  situation. The  KPC  has  the  support  of  the  people  in Kosova,  the  U.S.  State  Department  and  the United Nations. Despite  the  allegations  made  in  support  of the  Kucinich  amendment,  UN  officials  have  investigated  the  allegations  leveled  against members  of  the  KPC  and  found  no  evidence to  support  them. International  military  and  civilian  leaders  in the  region  have  expressed  their  support  and gratitude  for  the efforts of  the KPC. NATO  Secretary-General,  Lord  Robertson, has  praised  the  Kosova  Protection  Corps  for its  work  throughout  Kosova,  which  has  included  repairing  roads,  bridges,  and  other  reconstruction and  relief projects. I urge my  colleagues  to oppose  amendment. The  CHAIRMAN.  The  question  the  amendment  offered  by  the  tleman from Ohio (Mr. KUCINICH).

They  are spending  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars on conventional and nuclear weapons,  and  we  are  subsidizing,  indirectly, that  proliferation  of  weaponry.  This year,  the  President  has  requested  $46.6 million for developmental assistance to India  through AID.  That  is  an  increase of  almost  $18  million  from  last  year\u2019s request.  I  cannot  recall  the  President asking  for  this  large  of  a  request  for India ever. I  understand  that  the  Glenn  amendment,  which  passed  the  U.S.  Senate,  is currently  imposing  sanctions  on  India for  some  of  these  violations.  So  why should  we  be  increasing  aid  to  a  country  that  we  are  currently  sanctioning for  human  rights  abuses  and  other travesties?  It  makes  absolutely  no sense to me. We  are  talking  about  25  percent  cut with  this  amendment.  I  think  it  is  justifiable,  it  sends  a  strong message,  one that  will  be  heard  around  the  world, but especially in India. Mr.  Chairman,  I  reserve  of my time. Mr.  CALLAHAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I yield  myself  such  time  as  I  may  consume. I  would  like  to  thank  the  gentleman from  Indiana  for  agreeing  to  withdraw his  amendment,  which  I  understand  he is going to do momentarily. The  objective,  or  my  objective  in handling  this  bill  is  to  wind  up  with  a final  document  that  does  not  have  offensive  language  in  there  to  my  views or  the  views  I  think  of  the  majority Members  of  Congress.  The  very  fact that the gentleman has agreed to withdraw  it  gives me my  victory,  and  I  can see  no  sense  in  standing  here  all  day long  and  delaying  the  possibility  of whether  or  not  Members  are  going  to be  able  to  get  out  of  here  in  a  timely fashion  to  catch  their  arranged  flights to  go  home  for  the  weekend.  So  I  have accomplished  my  mission,  and  that  is that the offensive language to me, with respect  to  India,  is  going  to  be  withdrawn  and  the  amendment  is  going  to be withdrawn. But  out  of  deference  to  those  who want  to  speak  in  response  to  the  gentleman\u2019s  remarks,  I  am  going  to  yield 7 of my 10 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California  (Ms.  with  the forewarning, Mr. Chairman,  that  she  is not going to come forward with a unanimous  consent  request  to  extend  this debate  and  preclude  the  possibility  of Members getting out of here  in a  timely fashion this afternoon.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  in opposition to the Burton amendment.  I yield  21\u20442 minutes  to  the  gentleman from New York (Mr. ACKERMAN). (Mr.  ACKERMAN  asked  and  was given  permission  to  revise  and  extend her remarks.) Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I am in opposition to the amendment offered by  the  gentleman  from  Indiana.  I  only regret  that  we  do  not  have  as  much time  to  put  the  light  of  truth  to  so many  of  the  things  that  he  said,  because  we  have  not  been  given  equal time in this debate. That  being  said,  the  House  has  rejected  the  gentleman\u2019s  amendment  on repeated  occasions,  and  I  do  hope  and expect it will do so again today. I think it  should  be  clear  to  all  by  now  that punishing  India  by  cutting  our  assistance  is not a policy  that this U.S. Congress will adopt. The  Burton  amendment  is  the  wrong amendment  at  the  wrong  time.  In  the wake of the President\u2019s successful visit to  India,  the U.S. and  India have a new opportunity  to  build  a  broad-based  relationship.  Instead  of  applauding  India for  establishing  a  joint  working  group with  the  U.S.  to  fight  against  terrorism,  the  amendment  would  punish India by cutting crucial assistance. The  gentleman  makes  a  great  many allegations  about  human  rights  abuses in  India,  but  conveniently  ignores  the fact  that  the  people  of  India  are  the major  victims  of  terrorism  perpetrated by  groups  supported  and  trained  in Pakistan  and  associated  with  Osama bin-Ladin.  In  fact,  after  the  Kargil  incursion  and  the  hijacking  of  an  Indian Airlines plane to Afghanistan, the Pakistani-backed  terrorists  have  stepped up  their  attacks  on  innocent  civilians and security forces in Kashmir. To  characterize  India\u2019s  struggle against  terrorism  as  a  violation  of human  rights  is  not  only  unjust,  but also  provides  aid  and  comfort  to  the terrorists  who  have  claimed  thousands of  innocent  victims  in  India.  That there  are  things  that  go  wrong  in  any civilized  society,  including  India,  are true,  and  some  of  the  things  the  gentleman  points  out  are  true,  but  these are  not  done  by  the  government  of India. Mr.  Chairman,  churches  are  bombed and  burned  here.  People  are  killed every day here. Women are raped every day  of  the  year  here.  These  things  are terrible,  but  it  does  not mean  that  our government  is  responsible.  The  best way  for  us  to  help  India  continue  to improve  its  human  rights  record  is  to engage  in  positive  and  constructive dialogue,  one  great  democracy  to  another,  not  with  punitive  sanctions  and cuts. The  momentum  that  we  have  gained in  relations  by  the  President\u2019s  visit needs  to  be  strengthened  and  sustained.  For  Congress  to  act  now  to stigmatize  India  for  alleged  human rights abuses would send the wrong signal  to  the  1  billion  democratic  people in  India.  I  urge  all  of  our  colleagues  to reject this amendment. Ms.  PELOSI.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield such  time  as  she  may  consume  to  the gentlewoman  from  New  York  (Mrs. LOWEY). (Mrs.  LOWEY  asked  and  was  given permission  to  revise  and  extend her  remarks.) Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in strong  opposition  to  the  amendment  of the  gentleman  from  Indiana  (Mr.  BURTON).  This  is  the  time  that  we  should be working  together on  environmental, education, and health issues. Ms.  PELOSI.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield such  time  as  she  may  consume  to  the gentlewoman  from  New  York  (Mrs. MALONEY). (Mrs.  MALONEY  of  New  York  asked and was  given  permission  to  revise  and extend her remarks.) Mrs.  MALONEY  of  New  York.  Mr. Chairman, I rise, as I have many times, in  opposition  to  the  Burton  amendment,  and  for  our  continued  support for the world\u2019s largest democracy. Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  today  to  express  my strong  opposition  to  this  ill-conceived  amendment. This  legislation  has many  problems,  but  one of  the  bright  spots  is  a  continued  commitment to our  Indian allies. Unfortunately,  this  amendment  will  unfairly cut  the  critically-needed  economic  assistance funding  for  India  included  in  this  legislation. As  an  important  ally  and  a  nation  committed to  strong  democratic  government,  India  has worked  hard  to  ensure  that  the  human  rights of all  its  citizens are protected. The  Indian  government  has  aggressively  responded  to  assaults  against  religious  minorities  and  has  repeatedly  expressed  its  commitment  to  ensuring  tolerance.  Recently,  in  response  to  attacks  on  Christians,  Prime  Minister  Vajpayee  reiterated  his  nation\u2019s  desire  to be  inclusive  of  all  faiths  and  to  ensure  equal justice  under  law  for  all  Indians.  We  should support  these efforts. India  is  also  one  of  our  key  trading  partners and  the  Indian  government  has  worked  hard to  create  a  friendly  environment  for  U.S.  firms. As  a  result,  U.S.  investment  in  India  has skyrocketed  in  the  last  ten  years.  Direct  U.S. investment  in  India  has  increased  from  $500 million  in  1991  to  more  than  $15  billion  today. Indin  has  demonstrated  a  commitment  to continue  this  growth  and  I  strongly  believe  that we must  support  their efforts. As  a  key  ally  and  a  fellow  deserves our  support. However,  Congressman  ment,  rather  than  rewarding  punish  the  people  of  India  by  cial humanitarian assistance. India  is  a  strong  and  vibrant  democracy.  It is  the  world\u2019s  largest  democracy.  And,  the U.S.  is  India\u2019s  largest  trading  partner  and  largest  investor. The  momentum  gained  in  tions  in  recent  years  needs  and  strengthened. A  vote  for  the  Burton  send  the  wrong  signal  to  from  the  U.S.  Congress  time. I  urge  a  \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019  vote  on  the  Burton  amendment  and  yield  back  the  balance  of  my  time. Ms.  PELOSI.

Let  me stipulate  that  I  think  the  gentleman from  Alabama  (Mr.  the subcommittee chair, is a very good person,  as  is  the  gentlewoman  from  California (Ms. PELOSI), the ranking minority member. We have very strongly differing views of how adequately this bill meets our responsibilities. I  think  the  distinguished  gentleman from Alabama has done a terrific job as subcommittee  chairman  the  last  6 years  given  the  fact  his  hands  have been  tied  most  of  the  time  by  budget resolutions.  I  do  hope  that  he  gets  the best  possible  ranking  minority  slot  on whatever  subcommittee  he  wishes  in the next Congress. But  having  said  that,  let  me  explain my  concerns  about  this  bill.  Despite the  increase  in  funding  for  debt  relief, this bill  still  falls over  $200 million, almost  $250 million  short  of  the  administration  request  for  debt  relief.  When one  includes  the  supplemental,  the International  Development  Organization  is  almost  $300 million  short  of  the administration request. We still have substantial shortages in the  African  Development  Fund,  the Asian  Development  Fund,  the  African Development  Bank,  which  is  only about  half  funded  at  half  the  level  the administration is requesting. There are a number of other shortfalls as well. I  think  we  need  to  understand  that, despite  everything  that  this  bill  does so  far,  it  still  does  not  lay  a  glove  on the major problem which confronts  the international  community  in  terms  of public  health.  In  1999  alone,  480,000 children  under  15  died  from  AIDS.  Approximately  430,000  of  those  deaths  occurred  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.  Around the  world,  as  was  noted  on  this  floor several  times  last  night,  1,700  children under  15  years  old  are,  in  effect,  newly infected  with  HIV  every  single  day. There  will  be  some  44  million  children in  the  34  most  affected  countries  who will be orphaned by that disease within the next 10 to 15 years. I  think  the  world  has  no  idea  the human carnage that  is  in store. When I look  at  this  bill,  even  with  the  adoption  of  the  two  amendments  that  were adopted  on  the  floor,  this  still  falls  far short  of  what  is  required  for  a  Presidential  signature.  The  administration is  still  opposed  to  the  bill,  and  I  certainly  do  not  intend  to  vote  for  the bill,  and  I  would  urge  Members  to  oppose it as well. of  to  LAHAN),  YOUNG  I  move  Florida.  Mr.  Chairstrike  the  last  last I  would  also  ask  that,  when  we  vote on  this  bill,  that we  remember  that we have  obligations  to  our  constituents, to  our  taxpayers,  and  to  the  fellow human beings with whom we share this planet. In  my  view,  this  bill  does  not  meet our  obligation  on  all  three  fronts. America  does  not  understand  how much  it  is  vulnerable  to  a  health  epidemic  because  of  the  shortfall  of  funds that  we  are  providing  in  crucial  international  and  domestic  health  funds.  I hope  that  we  do  not  find  out  over  the next  20  years  just  how  vulnerable  we are.  But  I  believe  that  the  LaborHealth  appropriations  bill,  which  we passed  earlier,  and  this  bill  both  fall very  far  short  of  defending  our  taxpayers and our citizens  from that problem. I  think  this  bill  generally,  especially with  respect  to  the  International  Development  Association,  is  needlessly unresponsive  to  the  needs  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world.  For  that reason,  I  would  urge  a  no  vote  on  this bill  and,  at  the  proper  time,  will  have a  motion  to  recommit  with  instructions. Mr.  man,  word. Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  compliment the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. CALas  has  so  many  other  of  my colleagues, for the tremendous job that he  has  done  shepherding  this  bill through  the  process,  getting  us through  the  subcommittee  and  the  full committee,  and  getting  to  first  base here  in  the  House.  We  will  move  on, then,  to  the  other  body.  We  will  round second,  then  we  will  round  third,  and we  will  come  home  with  a  bill  that  is probably  not  as  perfect  as  the  gentleman  from  Alabama  (Mr.  said that it was, but it is a bill that has to be passed. I  also  want  to  compliment  the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin  (Mr.  OBEY)  and the  gentlewoman  from  California  (Ms. for  the  role  that  they  have played,  and  I  thank  all  of  the Members who  took  part  in  this  great  debate  all day yesterday and most of today. We  have  talked  about  a  lot  of  issues. Some  of  them  even  were  about  appropriations,  believe  it  or  not.  Most  of them were authorizing issues. But, nevertheless,  this  was  a  good  vehicle.  We had  good  debate.  For  the  most  part, the  Members  were  very  respectful  of each other and that is great. The  gentleman  from  Alabama  (Mr. CALLAHAN) will play a major role in the balance  of  this  Congress  and  in  the next  Congress  and  as  many  Congresses as  he  chooses  to  be  here,  because  he  is an  obvious  leader,  and  he  is  recognized as  such.  His  ability  to  move  this  bill, which  is  one  of  the  most  difficult  bills to pass, is proof positive of what I have said. I  want  to  compliment  all  of  our  colleagues  in  the  House,  Mr.  Chairman, because  this,  believe  it  or  not,  is  the 11th  appropriations  bill.  This  is  only CALLAHAN) PELOSI)  July.  This  is  the  11th  appropriations bill  that will go  through  the House not including  the  supplemental,  which  we have  already  passed  and  conferenced earlier.  So  I  am  proud  of  this  House  of Representatives. The  differences  are  obvious.  That  is why  there  is  435  of  us  to  express  these differences.  But  this  House  has  done  a good  job  in  meeting  its  constitutional responsibility  to  move  appropriations bills. With  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  again,  I want  to  compliment  the  gentleman from  Alabama  (Chairman  for an outstanding  job, and I guarantee him  that  he  is  going  to  be  chairman  of something  very,  very  important.  In  response  to  the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin  (Mr.  OBEY),  we  are  hoping  that he  continues  to  be  the  ranking  minority  member  for  a  long  time,  emphasis on \u2018\u2018minority.\u2019\u2019 Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  the  Members  to oppose  the  motion  of  the  gentleman from  Wisconsin  (Mr.  OBEY)  to  recommit this bill and to get to final passage and  send  the  bill  on  to  the  other  body.

While  the  final amount  of  allocated  resources  may  be  more or  less  in  the  final  analysis,  Governor Keating,  the  Department  of  Human  Services Board, and I all agreed that we must begin to move  forward  with  a  significant  commitment  of  resources.  We  will  not  let  a  lack  of funding deter us  from meeting this goal that will  positively  impact  Oklahomans  in  all walks of life,\u2019\u2019 Regier concluded. Regier  was  in  Washington  to  represent Governor  Keating  at  a  press  conference  for The  Empowerment  Network  (TEN).

Regier  was  joined  at  the  press  event  by Keating\u2019s  national  co-chair,  Senator  Dan Coats  (R\u2013IN),  who  presented,  Empowerment Blueprint  2001:  Strategies  for  Family  and Community Renewal, a  \u2018\u2018step-by-step agenda for  leaders  at  the  national,  state,  and  local levels, and the private sector. STATE OFFICE OF OF OKLAHOMA, THE GOVERNOR, DEAR MEMBERS:  COMMISSION Oklahoma City, OK. DHS  This  letter comes as a request  for you to take a bold step  towards  meeting  one  of  the  goals  I\u2019ve set for Oklahoma\u2014to reduce the divorce rate by 1\u20443 by 2010. I\u2019m asking you to make a commitment  to  spend up  to  $10 million  this next year  from  TANF  funds  for  strategies  that will  strengthen  Oklahoma marriages,  resulting  in  a  reduction  in  divorce.  In  discussions between  Secretary  Regier  and  Director Hendrick,  it  would  appear  that  this  level  of funding  is  an  appropriate  beginning  for  this important effort. Because  of  the  Oklahoma  Marriage  Initiative,  people  in  all  sectors  of  our  society  are taking notice of the consequences of divorce, especially  for  families with children, and are clamoring  for  action.  While  this  is  a  very new  subject  for  policy makers,  and  there  are a limited number of program demonstrations to  build  on,  the  overriding  need  makes  it necessary to proceed with our best efforts. As we continue to build our strategy for reducing  the  divorce  rate,  we  must  pay  attention  to  what  we  can  do  to  address  couple unions  in  low-income  populations.  We  must also  look  for  strategies  to  strengthen  twoparent  families  and marriages  for  non-needy persons  in  these  communities.  Certainly  the federal  government  understood  that  when  it drafted  the  TANF  guidelines,  with  three  of today the  four  goals  related  to  strengthening marriage/reducing  divorce  and  reducing  out-ofwedlock births. These four goals are: (1) \u2018\u2018to provide assistance to needy families so that the children may be cared for in their homes or in the homes of relatives.\u2019\u2019 (2)  \u2018\u2018to  end  dependence  of needy  parents  on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work and marriage . . .\u2019\u2019 (3)  \u2018\u2018to  prevent  and  reduce  the  incidence  of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and establish annual  numerical  goals  for  preventing  and  reducing the incidence of these pregnancies\u2019\u2019 (4)  \u2018\u2018to  encourage  the  formation  and maintenance of two-parent families.\u2019\u2019 As  Commission  Members,  I  don\u2019t  need  to tell  you  how  vital  it  is  that  we  devote  resources  to  support  this  important  goal. While  some  in  the  country  are  asking  why the  government  would  become  involved  in the  issue  of  marriage  and  divorce,  we  know clearly  the  reasons  because  of  our  on-going initiative: Many  of  society\u2019s  ills  can  be  traced  to  the rapidly  declining  status  of marriages  in  this country. Couples  marrying  for  the  first  time  have at least a 50% chance of divorce. The  conflict  that  precedes  and  surrounds divorce  causes  great  mental,  physical  and economic  damage  to  parents  and  children alike. The  \u2018\u2018triple  threat\u2019\u2019  of martial  conflict,  divorce,  and  out-of-wedlock  births has  led  to  a generation  of  U.S.  children  at  great  risk  for poverty,  alienation,  and  antisocial  behavior. The  decline  in  marriage  cuts  across  nations,  class  religion  and  races,  however  it  is most  marked  among  the  poor.  Low-income individuals  are  at  higher  risk  of  out-of-wedlock  childbearing,  of  cohabitation,  are  less likely to marry, and when they do marry are more  likely  to  separate  and  divorce  than middle  or  high-income  couples.  The  proportion  of  children  who  live  with  only  one  parent  has  more  than  doubled  nationally  since 1970, from 12% to 28% in 1998. This  development  is  causing  growing  concern  among  policy  makers  and  the  public. The costs of single parenthood are most serious  for  children  and  for  society  as  a  whole. Almost half (49%) of children in female-headed  households  were  poor  in  1998.  Single-parent  households  are  five  times more  likely  to be  poor  than  two  parent  households.  Studies document  that  children  raised  in  single-parent homes are at greater risk of poverty, and other negative  outcomes  such  as  school  drop out,  juvenile  delinquency,  teen  pregnancy and themselves become divorced. Nationally, over half of the parents receiving welfare are not  married  to  their  child\u2019s  other  parent, nearly  20%  are  divorced  or  separated,  11% are married (DHHS, 1999). Several  major  theories  have  been  put  forward  to  account  for  the  nationwide  decline in  marriage.  Certainly  part  of  that  decline can be attributed to the expansion of welfare programs  that  occurred  in  the  late  1960s  and 1970s. Since these programs were targeted on single-parent families, it is often argued that the  government  was  stepping  in  to  take  the place  of  others,  undermining  their  responsibility  to  provide  for  their  families  and  creating  financial  incentives to break up or discourage  marriage  on  the  theory  that  \u2018\u2018you get  more  of  what  you  subsidize.\u2019\u2019  I  applaud you  for  the  changes  you  have  made  in  DHS policy to change this trend in Oklahoma. Now,  I\u2019m asking you to take the next step. . . .  to  build  the  capacity  of  our  systems  to strengthen  marriages  and  reduce  divorces. . . .  and  to  provide  new  martial  direct  services to all of our Citizens statewide. Over the coming months we will  be working with  you to  develop  details  of  our  action  plan,  including  some  of  the  components  summarized  on the  attachment,  and  indeed  DHS  Director Hendrick  will  be  vitally  involved  in  finalizing these plans with Secretary Regier. There are many highlights of the plan that you will hear about over the coming months, but  both  Cathy  and  I  are  convinced  of  the value of skills training for couples. Over this past year we have heard from several martial experts  that  relational  qualities  and  patterns  of  interaction  assume  a  much  greater importance  in  contemporary marriages  than in  former  times. Most of  the  traditional  economic,  legal,  social  and  cultural  constraints that  used  to  keep  marriages  together  have fallen  away.  In  addition  couples  now  have higher  expectations  for  marital  happiness\u2014 having  all  one\u2019s  needs  met  by  one\u2019s  marital partner\u2014and  are  readier  to  dissolve  the union  if  they  are  not  satisfied.  The  result  is that  there  is much more  pressure  on  couples ability  to  communicate  well,  negotiate  and resolve  conflict,  accept  each  other\u2019s  differences,  and  stay  committed  to  working  on their relationship. We must find ways to help Oklahomans  strengthen  these  skills  if  they are to continue marriages in today\u2019s culture. Over  a  year  ago  I  addressed  all  Oklahomans  in  my  Inaugural  address  and  in  my State  of  the  State  address  to  reduce  the  social  ills  that hold us  back  as  a  people  and  as an  economy.  I  then  asked  Jerry  Regier,  my Cabinet  Secretary  for  Health  and  Human Services,  to  take  the  lead  on  building  this initiative  on  my  behalf,  and  we\u2019ve  made great  progress  over  this  past  year  in  raising public  awareness  about  the  consequences  of divorce. During this upcoming year, I\u2019ve told Jerry  to  call on  the very best  experts  in  this country to finalize and implement a strategy that  will  result  in  stronger  marriages.  He  is available  to  work  with  you  and  Director Hendrick  to  make  sure  that  we  achieve  our shared  goal  of  reducing  the  divorce  rate  in Oklahoma, as well as the goal of TANF monies to promote and strengthen marriage. Thank  you  for  your  continued  commitment  to  the  citizens  of Oklahoma  and  I  urge you  to  act  now  to  obligate  these  critical funds towards achieving our goals.

It  costs  him just  as  much  to  buy  a  loaf  of  bread  in the  local  store  as  it  does  the  president of  a  local  bank  that may make  four  or five  times  as  much.  Now,  obviously, people  go  into  education  or  nursing  or into professions or rescue squads or fire departments  to  make  a  difference,  and we are talking about education. 1715 The  truth  is we have  to  start valuing and honoring those teachers and say to them, you  do  a  good  job, we  appreciate what  you  are  doing,  instead  of  beating up on them all the time. I  yield  to  the  gentleman  land. Mr.  CUMMINGS.  I  thank  the  gentleman for yielding. I was just thinking about  what  you  were  saying.  It  is  important  that  we  do  pay  our  teachers wages  that  are  reasonable  and  that they  can  live  off  of.  There  was  just  an article  in  the  paper  in  Baltimore  that stated  that  as  we  move  towards  September,  the  September  opening  of school, we  have  a  teacher  shortage  and we  are  doing  everything  in  our  power to  find  teachers.  But  one  of  the  things that  is  for  sure,  we  have  got  to  pay them. We have got to pay them well. I  want  to  go  back  to  something  you said about conditions of teaching. I was talking  to  some  friends  of  mine  who teach in private school. The interesting thing  to  note  is  that  these  folks  were actually making  a  little  less  than  they would  make  in  public  school.  I  said  to them,  why  did  you  make  that  change? They  said,  because  of  the  conditions. They  were  able  to  teach  smaller  classes.  Their  hearts  are  into  making  sure that every child succeeds, that no child is  left  behind,  and  they  felt  that  the conditions,  if  it  got  to  34  or  35  kids  in a class that trying to teach it was very, very  difficult,  not  that  they  did  not want  to  do  a  good  job  but  it  was  very hard to be effective. I  agree  with  you.  One  of  the  things that  I  was  thinking  about,  too,  as  you were  talking  is  that  in  Baltimore,  one of our first high schools to get blue ribbon  status  was  a  school  that  I  graduated  from  in high  school  that  just got this  national  blue  ribbon  status,  Baltimore  City  College  High  School.  One  of the  things  you  were  talking  about  a little earlier was  the advanced courses, college  courses.  What  that  goes  to  is high  standards,  high  standards  and high expectations. I did not want to let that go by. Mr. ETHERIDGE. For all children. Mr.  CUMMINGS.  For  all  children.  I think  what  happens  so  often  is  that  if you  have  low  expectations,  then  children  do  not  even  know  the  standard  to even  reach  for  the  high  expectations. But  one  of  the  things  that  I  have  noticed,  you  and  I  had  a  discussion  not that  are  happening.  And  I  want  to  pay attention  to  the  good  things  that  are happening  for  a  lot  of  children  who come  from  some  tough  backgrounds and  tough  opportunities  who  are  already  achieving.  ACT  scores  are  up. Students are taking more AP exams. I  would  share  with  the  gentleman what  an  AP  exam  is.  When  people  say what  does  that  acronym  mean,  it  really  means  an  advanced  placement course  for  a  student  who  is  in  high school.  Let  us  say  the  school  only  offers  a  second  year  of  algebra  and  the student wants to take physics or something  else.  They  can  actually  take  an advanced  placement  through  a mailing and  then  they  can  take  that  test.  It  is a  college  level  course  at  high  school, and  some  students  can  take  several courses,  saving  a  lot  of  money  when they  get  to  the  university.  And  we  are seeing that improved tremendously. Another  point  I  would  make  before  I yield  is  that  we  are  all  concerned  that our schools be totally safe, every one of them.  And  we  want  that,  and  we should.  But  the  truth  is  violence  is down  in  our  public  schools  dramatically; and public school teachers, by all the  statistics  out,  are  really  better educated  than  they  have  ever  been. And,  on  average,  they  are  better  educated  than  many  of  them  who  are  in some  of  the  private  schools  we  have  in this  country.  More  students  out  of  our public  schools  are  going  to  the  universities. What  folks  forget  is  that  we  have more  children  in  public  schools  today than we have ever had in the history of this  country.  Now,  the  challenge  we face  is  if  we  have  more  people,  guess what  that  is  going  to  mean?  Our  resources are strained because classes are more  cramped,  we  need  more  teachers, we need all the things to support them, and  if  we  are  going  to  have  smaller class  sizes,  we  have  to  run  faster  just to  keep  up.  And  that  is  the  point  the gentleman  was  making,  as  we  start trying  to  encourage  young  people  to get  into  the  professions  that  they may not have thought about. One  of  the  points  the  gentleman made  as  we  were  talking  earlier,  and the  gentleman  is  absolutely  right,  is that  the  challenge  we  face  today  is  recruiting people to teach our young people. How do we  recruit  the quality people  we  need  to  get  there?  There  was  a time  in  this  country  when  we  had  a fairly  adequate  supply  of  teachers.  Unfortunately, it was a time when the opportunities  for  women  were  not  what they  are  today,  because  they  either went into nursing, clerical jobs, or into teaching,  and  we  were  blessed  by  that. But  once  we  opened  the  doors  to  all professions,  and  we  should  have,  not only  for  women  but  all  others,  that then  made  the  job  of  retaining  and  attracting  the  people  we  need  in  education  and  in  nursing,  as  the  gentleman  mentioned  earlier,  more  difficult.  This means  that we  have  to  pay more  attention  to  making  sure  that those  professions  not  only  are  attraclong  ago  about  when  we  go  into  our schools  and what makes  a  good  school, what  do  you  see  in  a  school,  what  do you  experience  in  a  school  when  you are visiting that tells you without anybody  showing  you  any  scores  that  it  is a  great  school?  One  of  the  things  that we  talked  about  was  that  you  had  a strong  principal.  You  had  excitement. You  could  just  see  it  on  all  the  walls, the  bulletin  boards,  that  things  were happening. But there was also an air of high  expectations.  I  think  that  that  is one  of  the  things  that  we  have  got  to get  back  to,  that  high  expectation. When  you  talk  about  the  schools  that you  have  just  talked  about  doing  better,  that  sends  a  message  to  other schools  and  it  says,  if  they  can  do  it  20 miles  down  the  road, we  can  do  it,  too. When  Baltimore  City  College  High School  in Baltimore  became  one  of  the few  predominantly  African  American schools  in  the  country  to  become  a  national  blue  ribbon  school,  not  only  did it  mean  a  lot  to  the  students  at  that school  but  it meant  a  lot  to  the  entire community.  There  were  other  students who  were  at  other  schools  similar  to Baltimore  City  College  High  School saying, we can do it, too. We  have  got  to  get  back  to  that,  to that  positive  role  model  stuff.  A  lot  of times we hear about negative role models.  I  think  years  ago  you  had  a  lot  of positive  role models. There  are  a  lot  of positive role models today, in students, in  schools,  in  neighbors.  I  think  the things  that we are  talking about  today are  the  good  things  about  our  schools. You  are  right.  We  hear  so  much  negative,  negative,  negative  but  there  are so  many  wonderful  things  happening since  the  last  time  you  and  I  discussed this,  because we have  seen  some  smaller  class  sizes,  we  have  seen  our  children  in  like  the  first,  second  and  third grade,  we  have  seen  their  scores  going up in Baltimore, too, substantially. Mr.  ETHERIDGE.  That  is  absolutely right. That is why it is imperative that this  Congress  not  go  back  on  the  commitment  they  made  and  to  keep  putting  that money  in  there. All  of  us  use the  language  of  the  new  economy.  It  is true,  it  is  propelling  our  business  cycles,  everything  is  revolving  around  it but  we  have  got  to  provide  national leadership  in  this  vital  area  of  education,  so  that  everyone  can  be  a  part of  this  new  economy.  We  cannot  leave people  behind.  If  we  do  not  make  sure that  every  child  gets  a  good  education, that  we  set  high  standards,  we  have high  expectations,  they  will  not  be  a part  of  it.  If  you  deny  in my  opinion  a child  an  education,  a  quality  education, you have denied the whole  family  of  that  because  once  they  get  married,  you  have  created  a  whole  second class  citizenship  for  those  children. Across this country, the American people  are  calling  out  for  greater  investment  in  public  education.  They  do  not care  whether  it  comes  from  Washington  or  their  State  capital  or  the local.  They  want  the  investment  in education. When we invest that money, ",
            "84": "H6044 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:69) July 13, 2000 are  affecting effect  of  them,  that  they  our national statistics. The Baltimore Police Department estimates  that  95  percent  of  the  street gangs  in  Baltimore  are  dealing  in  drug trafficking,  specifically  heroin  and  cocaine.  Former  Mayor  Schmoke\u2019s  nonenforcement  policy  led  to,  in  1996,  Baltimore\u2019s  leading  the Nation  in  drug-related emergency emissions, which grew to  785  per  100,000  population.  Of  20  cities analyzed by NIDA, which  is our National  Institute  of  Drug  Administration,  the  city  of  Baltimore  ranked  second  in  heroin  emergency  admissions, and Baltimore accounted  for 63 percent of all of Maryland\u2019s drug overdoses. This  is  again  the  legacy  that  the President  of  the  United  States  did  not want  to  talk  about,  but  the  NAACP heard other statistics today, even touting  the  progress  that  we  have  made, and much of it under, again, zero tolerance  efforts  around  the  country.  Even with  decreasing  crime  since  1960,  total crimes have increased by more than 300 percent. Since 1960, violent crimes have increased  by  more  than  550  percent. Ninety-nine  percent  of  Americans  will be  the  victims  of  a  theft  at  least  once in their lives. What  is  interesting,  when  we  talk  to the  law  enforcement  people,  whether they  are  in  Baltimore,  Orlando,  or  in New  York,  they  tell  us  that  70  or  80 percent  of  the  crimes  committed  are drug  related;  people  who  are  stealing and  maiming  and  killing  because  they are  on  illegal  narcotics  or  trying  to gain  resources  to  obtain  illegal  drugs. The  violent  crime  rate  in  the  United States  is  worse  than  any  other  industrialized  country,  and  we  can  again trace it back to drug abuse. Never in the President\u2019s speech today did  he  talk  about  the  effect  of  illegal narcotics  before  the  NAACP  and  the minority  population  of  our  country, which,  unfortunately,  is  the  most  victimized,  victimized  in  death,  victimized in social destruction, victimized in every  way  imaginable,  in  the  criminal justice system unfairly victimized. And we will hear people  say, well, we just  need  to  treat  folks  and we  need  to spend more money  on  treatment,  and  I will  talk  about  that  in  just  a  few minutes;  but  treating  only  the  wounded  in battle  is never  the answer  if you are  in battle  and  really  waging  an  aggressive fight. Teenagers  are  more  than  twice  as likely  to  be  the  victims  of  violent crimes  as  all  adults  combined.  And fewer  than  10  percent  of  all  criminals commit  about  two-thirds  of  the  crime. Again,  I  show  the  statistics  of  this administration  and  their  record  for prosecution  as  it  dropped. And  then we got  them  to  go  after  prosecution  from 1996 on, when we took the majority and put  pressure  on  them.  Now  they  are dropping  sentencing,  the  amount  of time  that  these hardened criminals are facing  behind  bars.  I  submit,  my  colleagues,  that  the  wrong  Americans  are behind  bars.  It  is  the  parents  and  the citizens  of Baltimore.  It  is  the wonderful citizens of Washington, D.C. Our Nation\u2019s capital is another example  of  a  horrible  situation  ignored  for 40  years  under  the  control  of  the  other party,  where  I  would  come  to  Washington  week  after  week,  and  every week  read  of  death  and  destruction, and  almost  all  of  it  drug  related.  Fortunately,  this  Republican  administration  in  the  Congress  brought  some  balance  to  the  District  of  Columbia.  We literally  had  to  seize  the  District  and put  a  control  board  in  charge  of  the District. But when we inherited the District of Columbia,  stop  and  think  of  what  this majority  inherited.  It  is  just  like what they  did  to  the  country  as  a  whole. This  District  of  Columbia  was  running three-quarters  of  a  billion  dollars  a year  in  deficit,  and  we  have  just  about balanced  that.  Of  course,  we  did  have to put  in a board of  control and, unfortunately,  had  to  deny  some  temporary constraints  on  home  rule.  But  we  inherited a horrible  situation. Again,  the President  of  the  United  States  did  not talk  about  what  40  years  of  Democrat administration  did  to  the  people  of Baltimore or Washington, D.C., our Nation\u2019s capital. I  always  save  some  of  these  articles about  again  what  took  place,  and  I  do not  want  to  divert  too  much  from  the narcotics  issue,  but  I  cannot  resist mentioning  for  the  benefit  of  my  colleagues  the  policy  that  really  almost destroyed  our  Nation\u2019s  capital  and  national  treasure. Here are a  few of  these articles.  The  trauma  care  center, when we  took  over  the  Congress  in  D.C.,  in grave danger.  It was basically nonfunctional.  The  housing  authority  was bankrupt  when  the  Republican  majority  took  over.  The  job  training  program  in  1  year  spent  $20  million  and did not train one person in our Nation\u2019s capital.  This  is  what  the  new  majority inherited. I will  never  forget  the  articles  in  the paper  about  the  morgue  and  the  air conditioning  having  broken  down  and bodies  were  stacked  up  because  the District,  under  the  Democrat  control, had  allowed  the  District  to  operate  in an  unmanageable  fashion.  What  happened  was  they  could  not  even  pay  to have  the  indigents  buried  in  the  city, and  they  were  stacked  like  cord  wood in  the  morgue,  and  the  morgue  had  no air-conditioning. The  City\u2019s  water  system  was  failing. We  had  to  give  it  over.  Basically  40 years  of  administration  and misadministration  led  to  this.  And  the stories  go  on  and  on.  They  are  unbelievable;  and  I  know  people,  unless  I brought  the  actual  articles,  people would  think  I  would  be  making  them up. The foster care system wears out employees.  This  is  a  lady  who  said  as  she was quitting because this is worse than Guam,  she worked  in Guam, what  they did  in  the  District  of  Columbia.  Again, primarily a majority of African Americans.  But  the  President  did  not  talk about  this  in  his  chat  before  the NAACP, what they did. But he did take credit  for,  I think, some of the changes that  we  have  made.  And  how  sad  for the neediest of the needy. Even  in  public  housing  an  article from the Washington Post. Let me read it.  It  says  the  Department  of  Public and Assisted Housing, which has had 10 directors  in  the  last  decade,  suggested that  it  was  rife  with  corruption,  mismanagement  and  waste.  And  this  is, again,  what  we  inherited  but  what  the President  did  not  talk  about  in  Baltimore  today.  And  affecting  who?  The minority  population.  And  the  weakest link  in  the  minority  population,  those without housing;  those  subjected to  social  services.  And  the  list,  again,  goes on and on. I  think  in  the  last  4  years,  as  good stewards,  the  new  majority  has  turned some of that around. But the President would  not  talk  about  that,  just  took credit  for  statistics  and  used  them  to his advantage. Unfortunately,  the  legacy  of  this  administration  goes  beyond Baltimore;  it goes  beyond  Washington,  our  Nation\u2019s capital.  Again,  I  have  said  this  before, it  is  not  rocket  science.  We  know where these drugs are coming from. We have  done  everything;  I  have  done  everything  I  can  do  since  I  came  to  Congress, since  I was  involved  in the effort back  in  the  Reagan  administration, back in the early 1980s when I helped to develop  the  drug  certification  law  and worked  on  some  of  the  Andean  strategies and other things to stop drugs cost effectively  at  the  source.  But  we  have watched  this  administration  dismantle those cost effective programs. Again, we know  exactly where  the  illegal drugs are coming from. Right now we know that 70 to 80 percent of the cocaine  and  heroin  is  coming  out  of  Colombia.  Now,  how  in  heaven\u2019s  name could we get that percentage of cocaine coming out of Colombia? And I want to say it was not easy. This is not a guessing  game,  either.  The  DEA  has  what  is called the DEA Signature program. The  DEA  provided  our  subcommittee with  these  pie  charts.  This  is  the most recent,  1998.  This  shows  us  exactly where  heroin  is  coming  from.  This shows  us  that  heroin  is  coming,  65  percent  of  it,  from  South America;  17  percent from Mexico. Actually, up some 20 percent  in  1  year  from  Mexico.  They know  this  because  when  they  seize  the heroin,  it  is  tested;  and  it  is  almost  a DNA  process  where  they  can  tell  almost  from  what  fields  it  came  from. This  is  all  Colombian.  The  red  here  is all Colombian. In  1992\u20131993  there  was  almost  zero heroin coming  from Colombia. But this administration,  through  an  incredible series  of  direct  policies  and  failures, has  managed  to  make  Colombia  the center  of  70  to  80  percent  of  cocaine coming  into  the United States, and another  65  to  70  percent,  depending  on which year, and we do not have  1999, of heroin  coming  into  the  United  States. We know that. There  was  almost  no  cocaine,  coca, produced  in Colombia  in  1992 at  the beginning  of  this  administration,  but ",

It totally repeals  any  tax  whatsoever  on  estates  of that size. Yesterday,  I  spoke  in  opposition  the  House  bill,  and  Senators  and  expressed  a  little  surprise. They  said  when  they  talk  to  ordinary folks  in  their home States,  they hear a lot  about  the  estate  tax,  and  people want  reform.  They wondered whether  I was  hearing  the  same  in  my  State  of Montana.  I  sure  am,  all  the  time\u2014in coffee  shops,  in  grocery  stores,  lots  of people  talk  to  me.  They  think  it  hits too  hard  on  farms,  ranches,  and  small businesses.  That  is  precisely  the  point. The  House  bill  responds  to  these  with an  abstraction\u2014repeal,  10  years  from now. The  Democratic  alternative  says,  no, we  are  not  going  to  wait  10  years;  we are going to do it now. We respond with honest-to-goodness  relief.  I  am  sure there  is  somebody  in  Montana  with  an estate  worth more  than  $8 million  who will  still  have  to  pay  some  estate  tax under  the  Democratic  alternative.  But there sure aren\u2019t many of them. Remember,  the  vast  majority  of  the estates  are  either  not  affected  by  the tax  now  or,  if  they  are,  would  be  completely  exempt  under  the  Democratic alternative.  One  other  virtue  of  the Democratic  alternative  is  it  costs much  less  than  the  House  bill,  $40  billion  less  over  10  years.  After  that,  the savings are even greater. As  a  result,  the  Democratic  alternative allows us not only to reform the estate  tax  in  a way  that helps where  it is  needed  the  most,  but  it  also  allows us  to  address  other  priorities  that, frankly, are more important than total repeal  of  the  estate  tax,  particularly for huge estates. For  example,  what  about  the  national  debt?  The  Democratic  alternative  leaves  an  additional  $40  billion available  to  pay  down  the  national debt.  Or  we  could  use  the  savings  to provide  tax  cuts  to  meet  other  important  needs;  help  average  families  save for  retirement  or  their  kids\u2019  college education,  or  help  people  meet  longterm medical care costs; protect Social Security and Medicare. Believe  me,  these  are  good  things that  we  hear  about  at  home  all  the time.  I  believe  that  more  people  are more  concerned  about  these  matters than  they  are  about  total  repeal  of  the estate  tax,  particularly  for  large  estates.

If we  are  to  go  forward with  a national missile  defense  system, we  should have honest,  realistic  testing,  including testing  for  countermeasures  so  we  can say  to  the  American  people:  Your money  is  being  well  spent;  so  we  can say  to  them:  If  this  is a  source of  security  and  defense  for  America,  it  is  one that will work and function. Some  have  looked  at my  amendment and  said  it  must  be  critical  of  the  system because DURBIN has questioned the system  in  the  past.

Human Services bill will be  sent  to  the President for signature prior to the August recess. I  am  happy  to  yield  to  my  good friend  from  West  Virginia.  Our  committee  works  on  a  totally  bipartisan basis.  I  have  not  done  anything  without  consulting  my  good  friend  from West  Virginia,  the  former  chairman.  I want  the  Senate  to  know  he  has  given me good advice all along. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from West Virginia. Mr.  BYRD.  Mr.  President,  this  is  my 42nd  year  on  the  Appropriations  Committee.  I  think  I  have  served  longer than  any Member,  past  or  present. The Appropriations  Committee  was  first created  in  1867.  I  don\u2019t  have  any  doubt that  I  have  served  with  the  greatest chairmen  who  have  served  on  that committee  since  its  inception  in  1867. That  was  133  years  ago.  I  have  served with  Senators  such  as  Carl  Hayden  of Arizona,  Dick  Russell,  John  Stennis, John  McClellan,  Allen  Ellender,  and Senator  Hatfield.  These  were  great chairmen. They had  long  service  in  the Senate.  I  served  with  all  of  them.  But I have never served with a better chairman  on  the  Appropriations  Committee than  the  current  chairman,  STEI  think  he  is  a  better  chairman than  I  was.  I  don\u2019t  say  that  idly.  He works at the job all the time. He works hard.  I  support  him  in  this  request  to the leaders. I  don\u2019t  happen  to  be  a  great  fan  of the treaty with China. I will have more to  say  about  that  later.  But  I  am  a great  fan  of  getting  these  appropriations  bills  down  to  the  President  on time.  When  I  was  chairman,  we  were able  to  get  all  the  appropriations  bills passed  before  the  beginning  of  the  new fiscal year. I  join  my  chairman  in  pleading  with the  leadership\u2014and  the  leadership  has been  most  cooperative  on  both  sides\u2014 to  help  get  these  bills  moved  and  into conference  and  down  to  the  President. The  chairman,  Mr.  hit  the nail  right  on  the  head when  he  said we don\u2019t  need  to  have  another  wrangle with  the  President  over  appropriations bills  right  at  the  end  of  the  session. That  plays  into  the  President\u2019s  hands. I  think  all  Senators  are  aware  of  the fact  that  I  believe  the  legislative branch  is  the  predominant  branch,  and was  meant  to  be  the  predominant branch  among  the  three  equal  and  coordinate  branches.  I  think  it  has  the upper hand, if Members of the Congress will  but  will  stand  up  for  the  Senate and its constitutional powers. I think  it  is  important  that we  finish these  bills  because, when we wait until the  end  of  the  session,  and  we  are  left with  an  omnibus  bill,  the  President wins  every  time.  You  may  think  you can  beat  the  President  in  that  deal. You can\u2019t do  it. The President wins because  he  then  has  the  upper  hand.  He has  your  back  to  the  wall.  Senators and  House Members  want  to  get  out  of here and go home. They have schedules to  fill  back  in  their  districts  and  in STEVENS,  their  States.  It  plays  into  his  hands  if appropriation  bills  only  reach  him  at the  last  minute.  I  don\u2019t  like  to  play into any President\u2019s hands. I think most Members are very aware that  we  need  to  work  with  the  President. But  it  is highly  important we get these  bills  passed.  Let  the  PNTR  wait. Why be  in such a hurry on that treaty? Why  be  in  such  a  hurry?  It  would  be better  if  we  were  to  take  a  little  more time  and  examine  that  treaty  more carefully  and  consider  what  the  ramifications of its approval may be. Last  night  we  were  able  to  get  legislation  adopted  to  create  a  national  security  commission.  It  will  be  a  congressional  commission.  We  will  not have  to  depend  upon  the  administration  to  tell  us  what  impact  that  trade with  China  may  have  on  our  national security.  We  will  have  our  own  commission.  It  will  be  appointed  by  the joint  leadership  of  both  Houses.  That commission  will  report  to  the  Congress. I  have  a  somewhat  jaundiced  eye when  it  comes  to moving  in  such  a  big hurry  to  take  up  the  China  treaty.  As far  as  I  am  concerned,  it  ought  to  go over  until  next  year.  Let\u2019s  take  another  look  at  it.  That  is  just  one  Senator\u2019s opinion. I  plead  with  the  leader\u2014I  say  to  this also  to  my  own  leader\u2014to  help  us  get these  appropriations  bills  passed,  to get them to conference, and then downtown. We  can  talk  and wrangle  and  debate  about  the  China  treaty  afterwards. I thank my chairman. Mr.  LOTT. Mr.  President,  if  the  Senator  from  Alaska  will  yield  briefly, first  of  all,  I  listened  carefully  to  the comments  of  the  two  distinguished Senators  who  are  the  ranking  member and  the  chairman  of  the  Appropriations  Committee.  The  service  of  these two  Members  surpasses  all  the  rest  of us,  with  the  possible  exception  of  the President  pro  tempore,  Senator  MOND. But beyond that, the wisdom and the  sage  advice  they  give  all  of  us  is greatly appreciated. I  certainly  believe  and  will  continue to believe that we should give the highest possible priority to these appropriations  bills.  We  have  an  agreement  now that  will  lead  us  to  the  conclusion  of the  Interior  appropriations  bill,  I  believe  next  Monday.  I  believe  the  votes could  possibly  be  on  Tuesday  morning. I  hope  before  we  go  out  for  the  August recess  that we  do  at  least  four more  or all  five  of  the  remaining  bills.  I  know clearly we  could do  four of  the  remaining  bills:  Agriculture,  Energy  and Water,  Treasury-Postal  Service,  and Commerce-State-Justice. There may be some  difficulty  with  HUD-VA  that would  cause  it  to  go  over  until  September. But  I  appreciate  their  comments  and their  good  advice.  I  will  certainly weigh  that  very  carefully.  I  appreciate the  fact  that  they  are  willing  to  take to  the  floor  and  ask  for  this  help  in getting  their  work  done.  In  fact,  it  is our work. It is the people\u2019s business. THURDASCHLE,  NICKLES,  I appreciate their comments. I  commend  and  thank  the  chairman of  the  Armed  Services  Committee,  and also  the  ranking  member,  Senator LEVIN, for the work they did on the Department of Defense authorization bill. We got it finished. Hallelujah. The Senate  has  produced  the  final  vote  on  one of  the  most  important  bills  we  will  do all year, the Department of Defense authorization  bill.  There  is  a  lot  of  important  language  in  there.  It  is  not only  about  the  ships,  the  planes,  and housing; It  is also about health care. It is  a  big,  important  bill.  Without  the patience  and  the  tenacity  of  the  chairman,  the  Senator  from  Virginia,  and the  help  he  received  from  the  Senator from  Michigan,  we  wouldn\u2019t  have  it done. I commend them; and, again, the senior  leadership  of  the  two  Senators  on the  Appropriations  Committee  who spoke is admirable. I appreciate it very much. As  a  leader,  you  have  to  rely  on the  senior  leaders,  and  the  managers, the  chairmen.  In  this  case,  I  did,  and they did it. I thank Senator STEVENS for his comments and for yielding me this time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  Senator from Alaska has the floor. Mr.  WARNER.  Mr.  President,  if  I could  have  1  minute  to  thank  the  distinguished leader. I  wish  to  acknowledge  my  deep  appreciation  to  our  distinguished  majority  leader,  and,  indeed,  to  Senator Senator  Harry  REID,  Senator and  all.  Yes,  chairmen  work hard and this posed some problems, but never  once  did  I  have  any  feeling  that leadership  was  not  determined  on  behalf of the whole Senate and this country  to  see  that  this  bill  was  passed. There  was  never  a  flicker  of  doubt  in my  mind  from  the  date  we  started some  31\u20442 weeks  ago.  I  thank  this  body for  the  leadership  that  we  have  to  get these difficult tasks performed. I yield the floor. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President,  to the Senator from Montana. Mr.  BAUCUS.  Mr.  President,  I  ask the majority  leader,  I  heard  him  speak about  the  desire  to  get  the  appropriations  bills  passed,  which  I  am  in  favor of,  but  did  I  hear  the  majority  leader say not only is it his intention to bring up  appropriations  bills  this month,  but did I hear him include PNTR? I  think  in  the  same  spirit  of  compromise  which  we  just  passed  the  Defense  authorization  bill,  as  it  has  been referred  to,  we  can  work  to  get  PNTR up  this  month  and  passed,  along  with the  appropriations  bills\u2014as  many  as we can. I say to the majority leader, I will do my  part  in  helping  with  the  estate  tax reform  bill  to  try  to  limit  the  amount of  time  on  that  bill  and  also  work  on other  appropriations  bills.  I  think  it  is necessary  that  PNTR  also  be  included in  the  list  of  measures  that  we  will bring up and pass this month. Mr.  STEVENS.  Mr.  President,  I  have the  floor  and  I  am  happy  to  have  that yield I  VerDate 11-MAY-2000 04:20 Jul 14, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G13JY6.023 pfrm01 PsN: S13PT1 ",

I  really  didn\u2019t think  it  was  enough.  I  think  there should be more.\u2019\u2019 I  was  involved  in  the  conference  in 1997.  I  will  tell  you  that  Secretary Rubin  totally  opposed  this  measure  in estate  tax  relief  throughout  the  entire process.  Assistant  Secretary  Summers was  also  completely  opposed  to  it.  For the  President  to  say  he  really  wanted to  do  more  is  factually  incorrect,  or maybe  his  Treasury  Secretary  was  not representing  his  interests.  Maybe  his Assistant Secretary  of Treasury, Larry Summers,  who  at  that  time  in  1997 said,  \u2018\u2018In  terms  of  substantive  arguments,  the  evidence  is  about  as  bad  as it  gets.  When  it  comes  to  the  estate tax, there  is no case other than selfishness.\u2019\u2019 That was  Larry  Summers  position  in 1997.  That  was  when  we  were  negotiating  the  tax  bill  in  1997,  on  which  the President  now  says  he  wanted  to  do more. I find that to be very interesting. The  President  also  said  to  the  Governors\u2014\u2018\u2018I  mean,  you  could  argue  the rates  are  too  high  because  they  are higher  than  the  maximum  income rates  now,  and  that  is  something  that didn\u2019t used to be the case.\u2019\u2019 That  is  right.  The  maximum  estate tax  rates  that  I  just  mentioned  go  up to 55 percent and 60 percent for the biggest estates, because we phased out the gradual  phasing  in  of  the  rates.  For  a taxable  estate  between  $10  million  and $17  million,  the  rate  is  55  percent; above $17 million, it is 60 percent. The  maximum  personal  income  tax rate is 39.6 percent\u2014actually it is higher  than  that  because  the  President eliminates  other  deductions  and  exemptions  and has no  limit  on Medicare tax\u2014he is implying he would be willing to  reduce  the  maximum  estate  tax from  55  to  39.6.  That  is  a  step  in  the right  direction,  because  rates  are  the problem. The Democratic proposal does not effect  the  rates.  It only  increases exemption.  If  we  have  an  estate  beyond  that exemption\u2014and  there  are  millions  of farms  and  ranches  and  businesses above  it;  they  are  $2  million,  $4  million,  $6  million\u2014they  are  hit  with  the rate. Because  of  the unified  credit, you are taxed at 37 percent. What  we  did  in  the  Republican  proposal  that  passed  the  House,  was change  the  unified  credit  to  an  exemption. Once a person is above the exemption  amount,  they  begin  paying  estate taxes at  18 percent, not  37 percent. The bipartisan  proposal  that  passed  the House,  that  we  will  vote  on,  that Chairman ROTH has been pushing, gives tax  relief  for  people  who  pay  estate taxes;  they  start  paying  at  18  percent instead  of  37  percent.  We  changed  the credit  to  an  exemption  and  that  benefits  the  lower  value  of  estates  that  are taxable. This  rhetoric  that  we  are  exempting the  big  estates  is  hogwash.  Big  estates pay capital gains when those properties are sold. They will pay when that property  is  sold\u2014not  when  someone  dies. That  rate  will  be  20  percent.  That makes  sense.  The  tax  is  paid  when  the property  is  sold,  not  when  someone dies. Too  many  people  are  faced  with  the very  unfortunate  circumstance which  I faced  when  my  dad  died.  I  was  young. My  father  passed  away,  and  we  had  a manufacturing  company.  The  book value  of  that  manufacturing  company was  zero.  The  Government  claimed  it was worth  a  lot. We  fought  the  IRS  for 7  years  over  the  value  of  the  company. We  ended  up  writing  a  big  check  and settling with the IRS. The Government wanted  a  big  chunk  of  the  Nickles Machine  Corporation.  They  said  it  was worth much more  than  we  did.  How  do we  know  what  the  value  is  unless  we sell  it?  The  Government  was  trying  to force us to sell the company. I am afraid this is happening today in millions  of  cases  all  across  the  country.  People  are  aware  that  this  may happen,  so  they  start  planning:  What shall  I  do?  Maybe  I  will  start  giving stock  to my kids. Maybe  the kids want to be in the business, maybe they don\u2019t want  to  be  in  the  business.  There  are schemes.  People  who  have  big  estates create  foundations.  They  do  all  kinds of things to avoid the tax. There  are millions  of  Americans  who don\u2019t  know  the  tax  is  coming.  If  they do,  they  are  worried  about  it,  or  they contain  their  plans,  or  they  don\u2019t  grow their  businesses.  That  is  yet  another negative  consequence  of  the  death  tax. They  say: Why  should  I grow  this business?  I will pass away, and  the Government will get over half. Why should we \u2018\u2018grow  it\u2019\u2019  if  the  Government  is  going to take half of it? As  a  result  many  new  jobs  are  not created.  Many  economic  transactions do  not  take  place  because  of  the  Government\u2019s  heavy  hand  coming  in.  That is  in  addition  to  the  fact  that  they taxed  the  property  when  it  was  originally  received  or  as  it  earned  income year by year. This  is  one  of  the  most  unfair  taxes on  the  books\u2014maybe  the  most  unfair tax  we  have  on  the  books  today.  It needs  to  be  repealed.  An  exemption will  not  cure  the  problem.  It  may  garner support  from some groups, but  it  is not  adequate.  Anybody  who  reads  the definition  of  \u2018\u2018farm\u2019\u2019  and  \u2018\u2018business\u2019\u2019 will  realize  they  do  not  qualify  for  the exemption. The  Democrat  substitute  is  not  feasible  and  it  should  not  pass.  I  urge my colleagues  to  vote  against  the  Democrat  substitute and vote  in  favor of  the Roth amendment. I  hope  we  will  be  voting  on  both  before  too  long  and  I  hope  those  are  the only  two  votes  we  have  on  this  bill.  I understand  we may  be  voting  on  twenty amendments  regarding  taxes  in general.  I  think  we  should  be  considering amendments  relevant  to  estate  taxes only. These extraneous amendments do not  help  the  process,  they  just  slow  it down. the 4 minI yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FITZGERALD). The Senator from Nevada. Mr.  REID.  I  yield  5  minutes  to  Senator from Massachusetts. Mr.  KENNEDY.  I  yield myself  utes. Mr. President, with all due respect to the  Senator  from  Oklahoma,  I  think the  two  Senators  from  North  Dakota spelled  out  very  clearly  and  convincingly  the  differences  between  the  position taken by the Republican majority, and  the  alternative  proposed  by  Democrats.  The  Democratic  proposal  basically  and  fairly  addresses  legitimate concerns  in  the  estate  tax  by  essentially  removing  the  estate  tax  from small  farms  and  businesses.  That  presentation  has  been  made  effectively  by the  Democrats.  I  don\u2019t  think  anything that  has  been  said  in  the  recent  moments  undermines  the  credibility  of the  Democratic  position.  I  think  the Democratic  alternative  proposal  reflects  the  views  of  the  overwhelming majority  of  the  Democrats  on  this issue. I  am  somewhat  amazed  as  we  come into  the  final days of  this period of  the Congress  that  we  are  talking  about how  we  are  going  to  reduce  the  taxes for  the  wealthiest  2,400  Americans. These people pay half of all  current  estate  taxes.  In  the  outer  years,  the  second  decade  after  a  repeal,  the  400 wealthiest  families  in  this  country would  save  $250  billion  in  taxes  under the  Republican  plan.  That  explains why  some  of  our  colleagues  on  the other side insist that we spend the Senate\u2019s  limited  time  addressing  only  the concerns of the wealthy. The  fact  is, we have 10 million Americans  today  who  would  benefit  from  an increase  in  the  minimum  wage.  We know  the  minimum  wage  has  fallen substantially  behind  in  its  purchasing power.  Why  isn\u2019t  the  Senate  of  the United States debating what we will do for  the  10 million  hard-working Americans,  working  40  hours  a  week,  52 weeks  of  the  year,  in  some  of  the most challenging  jobs  in  our  society?  What is  it  about  the  priorities  of  the  Republicans trying to protect the interests of the  very  wealthiest  individuals  in  our society, rather than trying to deal with the  hard-working  Americans  who  are at  lower  levels  of  the  economic  ladder\u2014in  this  case,  hard-working  Americans  making  minimum  wage?  Many  of these  workers  are  women,  including women  who  have  children;  and  a  significant number are men and women of color.  This  is  a  family  issue.  It  is  a children\u2019s  issue.  It  is  basically  a  fairness issue. No,  the  Republicans  with  this  issue want  to  reduce  taxes  on  the wealthiest individuals,  $250  billion  additional  for the  400  wealthiest  families  in  this country.  Should  that  surprise  Members?  No.  I  look  back  to  the  debate from  the  mid-1990s.

I have been advocating tuition deduction  since  I  first  announced  my  candidacy for the Senate 28 years ago. Earlier  this  year,  I  was  pleased  that  the President made  a  proposal  in  his  State of  the  Union  Address  which  would  finally fully enact this proposal. The  amendment  Senators  BAYH,  and  I  are  offering today  will  provide  America\u2019s  middle class  families  with  a  tax  deduction  of up to $12,000 for the costs of college tuition and fees. Middle-class  families who  send  their  kids  to  college  some  tax  relief.  We  should  ing  tax  cuts  to  those  who  least. The  proposal  Senator  and  I are  offering  is  a  tax  cut  that  makes sense.  It  is  a  tax  cut  that  benefits  the middle  class,  and  it  is  a  tax  cut  that  is an investment in America\u2019s future. Mr.  President,  the  dream  of  every American is to provide for their child a better life than they themselves had. A key  component  in  attaining  that dream  is  ensuring  that  their  children have  the  education  necessary  to  successfully  compete  in  the  expanding global economy. It  is  my  hope  that  the  proposal  we are  offering  today  will  help  many American  families  move  a  step  closer in  achieving  this  dream  and  be  able  to better  afford  to  send  their  children  to college. I  am  proud  to  join  Senator  He and I, together and separately, have been  pushing  for  this  relief  for middleclass  taxpayers  to  send  their  kids  to college  for  a  long  time.  I  apologize  to my  colleague,  ROTH,  for  whom  I have great respect. He has heard me on this  hobby  horse  about  tuition  tax credit  longer  than  he  cares.  I  am  not suggesting  he  does  not  share  the  same concern,  but  I  apologize.  He  has  heard me  make  this  speech  since  1973  when  I was a freshman Senator. As  one  of  the  folks  in  Delaware  said to  me:  when  are  you  going  to get  off  that  hobby  horse?  I  am  not going  to  get  off  the  hobby  horse  because,  as  the  Senator  from  New  York indicated,  as  a matter  of  public  policy, we  should  be  making  it  easier,  not harder,  for  children  to  go  to  college. We  should  not  make  these  false  distinctions between you are able, maybe, to  get  to  a  community  college  or  to  a junior college or maybe your State college,  but  you  are  not  going  to  be  able to get to a private institution. If  a  child  has  the  intellectual  capacity,  interest,  and  drive  and  they  are able to go to Harvard or the University of  Chicago  or  one  of  the  great  institutions  in  America  where  we  all  know you  get  a  little  leg  up\u2014I  had  one  son graduate  from  Syracuse  Law  School and  did  just  as  well  as  the  son  who graduated  from  Yale  Law  School,  but the marks  of  the kid who went  to Yale SCHUMER. SCHUMER BILL BIDEN,  Law  School  were  no  different  than  the one who went  to Syracuse Law School. He  got  his  ticket  punched,  a  ticket  to ride. We all know  it makes a difference to what school you have access. We  have  essentially  priced  middleclass  kids  out  of  the  finer  institutions. They  may  not  learn  any  more  coming out  of  those  institutions,  but  they  get a  heck  of  a  lot  more  opportunities, which  I  can  say  as  a  graduate  of  my State  university,  of  which  I  am  proud. Since  1980,  college  costs  have  been rising  on  average  two  to  three  times the  Consumer  Price  Index.  Now  in  the most  prosperous  time  in  our  history, people  still  have  trouble.  Let  me  give my colleagues a little idea. According  to  the  U.S.  Department  of Education,  National  Center  for  Education  Statistics,  the  average  annual costs  with  attending  a  public  4-year college  during  the  1998\u20131999  school year,  including  tuition,  fees,  room, and board were  $8,018. For a private university,  that  average  cost  was  $19,000.  If you  decide  to  send  your  child  or  your child  decides  they  wish  to  go  to  a  private  university\u2014I  had  one  go  to Georgetown,  one  go  to  Penn,  and  one go  to  Tulane.  That  is  a  total  of  over $100,000  a  year  in  tuition,  which  is  the reason I have the dubious distinction of being  rated  as  one  of  the  poorest  men in  the  U.S.  Congress.  I  am  not  poor.  I live  in  a  beautiful  home  in  a  beautiful neighborhood. I do not think I am poor, but  I  have  $125,000  in  debts  for  college tuition. The  good  news  is,  as  the  Senator said,  I  was  able  to  borrow  it  because  I had  a  nice  enough  house  to  borrow against  on  a  second  mortgage.  What happens  to  the  average  American  who has  a  good  income,  they  have  a  decent income\u2014the  wife  is  making  $30,000  or $40,000,  and  the  husband  is  making $30,000  or  $40,000.  That  is  70,000,  80,000, 90,000  bucks  a  year.  After  taxes,  what do  they  have?  Maybe  somewhere  between  $40,000  and  $50,000.  After  they write  that  first  semester  tuition  check for  15  grand,  like  I  am  about  to  do  for Tulane  University,  they  are  in  pretty deep trouble. Every middle-class American  knows  that.  What  I  am  a  little concerned  about  is  we  are  paying  very little  attention  to  this.  This  is  about priorities. I  had  a  different  bill  than  my  friend from  New  York. Mine  was  $10,000  up  to $120,000.  His  is  $12,000.  His  has  some better  features  than  mine,  but  we joined  forces  to make  the  case. My dad always  said  to  me:  Champ,  I  tell  you what,  if  everything  is  equally  important  to  you,  nothing  is  important  to you, unless you have priorities. This  is  about  priorities.  If  the  Senator  from New York  and  I  had  our way and  we  could  make  this  country  as great  as  it  is  now  without  any  taxes, we,  like  everybody  else  here,  would vote against any tax for anything. I am all  for  no  taxes,  but  what  are  our choices? Our  choices  are we  cannot  cut all  taxes.  So  the  question  comes: What are  we  going  to  do  in  cutting  taxes? SenAre  we  going  to  spend  $134  billion  over the  next  10  years  to  deal  with  the \u2018\u2018death  tax\u2019\u2019  and  $750  billion  over  the next  10  after  that,  or  are  we  going  to spend  $40  billion  over  10  years,  as  the Senator from New York\u2014\u2014 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator\u2019s 5 minutes have expired. Mr.  BIDEN.  I  yield  myself  30  more seconds.  Are  we  going  to  spend  $40  billion  to  provide  for  the  opportunity  for this  to  truly  be  an  egalitarian  system, a meritocracy? When  we  graduated  from  school  in the early 1960s and  late 1960s, and when our parents did in the 1930s, you needed a high school education to make it, and a  college  education  was  nice.  Now  you need  a  college  education  just  to  make it. So  I  think  people  should  be  able  to deduct  at  least  this  $12,000  and  get  a tax  credit.  This  is  a  matter  of  priorities.  The  priorities  should  be  to  take care of the middle class first. I reserve the remainder of the time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  Senator from New York. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 2  minutes  to  one  of  the  cosponsors  of the  amendment  and  the  author  of  the provision  on  teacher  certification,  the Senator from Louisiana. Ms.  LANDRIEU.  Mr.  President,  I  am very  pleased  to  join my  colleagues,  the Senator  from  Delaware  and  the  Senator  from  New  York,  in  cosponsoring this  amendment.  The  part  I  particularly  want  to  speak  about  for  the  2 minutes  that  I  have  is  the  teacher  tax credit. We  have  spent  much  time  talking this  year  about  the  ways  we  could  improve  education  in  this  Nation.  We have  talked  about  the  important  components  of  improving  education,  which is  a  State  and  local  partnership  with the  Federal  Government.  But  we  all agree, even across party  lines, that one of  the  key  components  of  improving education  in  the  Nation  is  to  provide quality  teacher  training,  incentives  for teachers  to  be  the  very  best  they  can be. Many  studies  have  shown  that  the single most  important  factor  in a child learning,  in  terms  of  at  school  in  the classroom\u2014families  have  a  great  input into  that,  obviously,  but  the  single most  important  factor  in a child  learning  at  school  in  the  classroom  is  the quality of the teacher. This  amendment  will  provide  a  tax credit  for  teachers  who  get  a  national certification, as we work with our Governors  and  with  our  mayors  and  with our  local  school  boards  to  help  bring excellence  in  education  across  this  Nation. So  I am pleased to have authored the part  of  this  amendment  which  would provide  this  tax  credit  because  if  we are going to give tax relief to America, and if we are going to give back a share of  the  surplus  in  this  way,  let\u2019s  give  a tax  credit  that  will  help  not  only teachers  but  education  and  our  children.

            "132": "July 13, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) S6623 BYRD, SenMr.  BAUCUS.  Not  only  in  Montana, but  all  across  the  country  because  this will  cost  $13  billion.  I  know  the  proponents  like  to  claim  that  the  $13  billion  would  be  spent  because  we  take  it from  other  programs.  But  I  point  out that  $13  billion  translates  per  150  days into about $30 billion a year. I  ask  my  good  friends  rhetorically: Where  are  we  going  to  cut  $30  billion for  other  programs?  I  don\u2019t  think  that is going to happen. Second,  even  though,  if  this  amendment  were  to  pass\u2014I  pray  that  it  does not,  but  if  it  were  to  pass\u2014Congress would  probably  go  into  a  big  scramble. I  know  my  good  friend  on  the  Appropriations  Committee,  Senator  and Senator STEVENS would say: Where in  the  world  are  we  going  to  find  $30 billion  in  one  year?  It  just  isn\u2019t  there. Mr.  REID.  Mr.  President,  I  yield  up to  5  minutes  to  the  Senator  from  New York,  the  ranking  member  on  the  Finance  Committee,  the  manager  of  this bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from New York. Mr.  MOYNIHAN.  Mr.  President,  I would  first  like  to  respond  to  the  minority  leader  and my  friend  from Montana. I  once  served  as  chairman  of  the Committee on Environment and Public Works.  I  managed  major  transportation legislation. I can say to you that absent this revenue  from  the  gasoline  tax,  which  we imposed under President Eisenhower in 1956,  and  which  built  the  Interstate Highway  System  and  transformed American  society,  the  transportation programs  will  just  stop.  There  is  no other  revenue  for  it.  It  is  a  dedicated revenue.  They  are  planned  on.  This would  be  the  first  time  they  have  been interrupted. A whole  industry would be interrupted,  not  to  mention  the  urban and State planning that goes on; not to mention  measures  such  as  the  Woodrow Wilson Bridge, which  is hugely  important  to  Virginia  and  to  the  District of Columbia. Another  point  on  the  matter  of  the price  of  gasoline:  Over  the  past  two decades  the  price  of  a  gallon  of  gasoline,  adjusted  for  inflation,  has  fallen by  exactly  a  third\u2014from  $1.49  in  1981 to,  in  those  dollars,  $1  in  June  of  this year. We  are  not  paying more  We are paying less for it. There  can  be  an  argument made  that the  price  is  too  low,  but  not  that  we should lower it further and deprive ourselves of the essentials of the transportation  infrastructure  and  construction in this Nation. Our  faithful  friend,  Dr.  Podoff, brought  along,  as  he  feels  he  should, Marshall\u2019s Principles of Economics. In Marshall\u2019s  \u2018\u2018Principles  of  Economics,\u2019\u2019  the  great  text  at  the  end  of  the 19th  century,  Marshall  taught  Keynes, who has taught the world, made it very clear,  that  in  situations  of  shortage such  as  we  are  temporarily  facing\u2014he was  talking  about  fish,  meat;  he  was gasoline. for  not  talking  about  gasoline\u2014the  price to  the  consumer  will  not  be  reduced. This  is  a  proposition  that  drives  from theory  and  is  confirmed  now  by  a  century of observation  in the aftermath of Marshall\u2019s principles. Consumers  will  get  nothing,  transportation  departments  will  get  nothing,  and  the  public  will  get  a  serious disruption  in  its  basic  transportation infrastructure,  which  is  not  simply highways,  but  all  the  other  related modes  of  transit.  This  is  what  we  have at  issue  here.  I  cannot  imagine we will do  other  than  continue  a  program  we have  had  in  place  since  1956,  a  third  of a  century,  with  extraordinary  results. To  stop  it  now  would  be,  in  my  view, irresponsible. Based  on  what  Marshall  taught  us, repealing the gasoline tax, even temporarily,  represents  a  futile  attempt  to repeal  the  laws  of  supply  and  demand. This is a somewhat curious activity for my  colleagues  on  the  other  side  of  the aisle  who  often  express  a  strong  commitment  for market economies both at home and abroad. Let  me  add  a  few  other  facts  about the  market  for  gasoline  and  other  fuel products\u2014facts  that  are  obvious  even to  those with  no  formal  training  in  economics. The  increase  in  the  price  of  a  gallon of  gas  from  an  average  of  $1.15  in  June 1999 to a peak of $1.71 in June 2000\u2014a 56 cent increase\u2014has nothing to do with a 4.3  cent  per  gallon  tax  increase,  enacted  in  1993,  or  the  total  federal  tax on  a  gallon  of  gas  of  18.3  cents,  neither of  which  have  increased  over  the  past 12 months. The price of a gallon of gas peaked at about  $1.71  in  mid-June  and  has  already  declined  by  about  8  cents.  The change  in  the  prices  has  nothing  to  do with  tax  policy  and  is  mostly  related to OPEC\u2019s production decisions. In  September,  1993,  the month  before the  4.3  cent  tax  increase  went  into  effect,  the  price  of  a  gallon  of  gasoline was $1.15. Three months later, after the tax increase, the price was $1.14. In 1996, the cost of gasoline  increased rapidly from $1.19 in January to $1.39 in May\u2014following  roughly  the  same  pattern  that  we  are  now  observing.  The Senate  debated  repeal  of  the  4.3  cent tax,  but  fortunately  took  no  action  as two attempts at cloture failed. By January,  1998  the  price  of  a  gallon  of  gasoline  was  back  to  $1.19\u2014and  in  real terms  had  actually  declined  a  few  pennies. And,  as  I  noted  earlier,  over  almost two  decades,  the  price  of  a  gallon  of gasoline  in  constant  (inflation  adjusted)  dollars  has  fallen  by  about  a third,  from  $1.49  in  1981  to  about  $1.00 in  June  of  this  year.  The  reduction  in gasoline  prices  occurred  even  as  the economy  expanded  almost  continuously\u201492  months  in  the  1980s  and  a record  setting  112  months  in  the  current  expansion,  which  shows  no  signs of  ending.  Over  the  past  two  decades the economy,  in real terms, has almost doubled,  while  the  unemployment  rate has been cut by half. True,  over  the  past  two  decades  the price  of  fuel  products  has  fluctuated, often  somewhat  unpredictably.  For  example,  in  1986  the  price  of  a  gallon  of gasoline decreased by 36 cents from the beginning  to  the  end  of  the  year.  The next  year  the  price  increased  by  11 cents.  While  economists  often  cannot predict,  or  even  explain,  energy  price volatility,  they  can  tell  us  the  effect, in the short-run, of reducing fuel taxes. The  price  to  the  consumer  will  not  be reduced. This is something we know; or it  can  be  said  as  much  as  things  like this  are  knowable.  For  a  century,  it has  been  the  clearest  understanding  of the  economics  profession  that  under short-run  supply  conditions,  a  change, such  as  a  reduction  in  an  excise  tax, does  not  affect  the  price  paid  by  the consumer. During  a  similar  debate  on  gas  tax repeal  in May  of  1996,  I  also  referred  to the theories of Marshall and attempted to summarize his wisdom. Here  is what I said then: Marshall  took  the  example\u2014to  illustrate  short-term  supply,  a  fascinating thing\u2014he  took  the  example  of  fish.  He said,  what  happens  if  there  is  a  sudden change  in  the  situation?  Weather makes  fish  more  or  less  available\u2014a nice  point\u2014or  if  there  is  an  increased demand  for  fish  caused  by  the  scarcity of  meat  during  the  year  or  two  following  a  cattle  plague.  Mad  cow  disease  in  the  late  19th  century.  A  scarcity  of  fish  caused  by  uncertainties  of the  weather  . . . . These  things  come. Would  outside  intervention  change  the price  of  fish  to  the  consumer  in  that circumstance,  when  there  was  a  fixed supply?  The  answer  from  Alfred  Marshall is emphatically \u2018\u2018no.\u2019\u2019 Students of economics  my  age  will  remember  this book.  It  is  a  very  heavy  book,  but  it  is still  around  and  it  works. What  it  propounded is very clear. And  now  let  me  state  the  conclusion as  simply  as  possible.  Market  values are  determined  by  the  relationship  between supply and demand. This is something businessmen know. In  1996,  Mr.  Mike  Bowlin,  Chairman  of ARCO,  had  this  to  say  about  the  matter  when  he  appeared  on  ABC\u2019s \u2018\u2018Nightline\u2019\u2019: My  concern  is  that  there  are  other market forces  that  clearly  will  overwhelm  the  relatively  small  decrease  in  the  price  of  gasoline,  and  that  alarms  me,  that  people\u2019s  expectations will be  that  the minute  the  tax  is removed,  they want  to  see gasoline prices go down . . . and that won\u2019t happen. At  about  the  same  time\u2014May  1996\u2014I noted,  on  the  Floor  of  the  Senate,  the comments  of  Dr.  Philip  Verleger,  a well-known  energy  economist.  The  author  of  several  books  on  the  subject, including Adjusting  to Volatile Energy Prices,  Dr.  Verleger  was,  at  that  time, quoted in The Washington Post: The  Republican-sponsored  solution  to  the current  fuels  problem . . . is  nothing  more and  nothing  less  than  a  refiner\u2019s  benefit bill. . . . It will transfer upwards of $3 billion from  the  U.S.  Treasury  to  the  pockets  of  refiners and gasoline marketers.

There  are  enormous  needs  in  all  these areas. This is an opportunity to address those enormous needs. I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  this amendment.  I  think  it  would  be  a major  statement  of  our  priorities.  We would  not,  in  fact,  leave  one  child  behind if we do this. I  yield  the  remainder  of  my  time  the Senator from Massachusetts. Mr.  KENNEDY.  Mr.  President,  understand,  I  have  8  minutes;  is  correct? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator has 3 minutes 30 seconds. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 21\u20442 minutes. As  the  Joint  Tax  Committee  pointed out,  as  printed  in  the  New  York  Times today, according to the data, 95 percent of  the  roughly  6,000  farmers  who  paid estate  taxes  that year would have been exempted under the terms of the Democratic  plan,  as  would  88  percent  of  the roughly  10,000  small  business  owners who  paid  the  tax.  That  responds  to my good  friends  from  Texas  and  Arkansas. I  understand  they  want  to  protect any  tax  loophole  that  is  in  there.  We have a billionaire tax loophole that has permitted  billionaires  to  leave  the country,  renounce  their  citizenship, and  pay  no  tax  at  all.  They  have  defended that in the past. The fact is, the wealthiest individuals are still going to get $150 billion in tax breaks. All  we  are  saying  is  that  it  is  more valuable  to  invest  in  the  education  of the  children  of  this  country  than  to give  the  400  richest  families  in  this country  $250  billion.  That  is  what  this amendment  does.  The  400  richest  families,  according  to Forbes magazine,  get $250  billion;  2,400  families  get  $300  billion.  We  are  saying,  $150  billion  for them. We need to get to what is essential to our  national  interest,  and  that  is  children.  It  is  a  matter  of  priorities.  They want  to  protect  the  billionaires\u2019  tax loophole;  they  want  to  protect  the  400 wealthiest  families  in  this  country. We want to be debating the minimum wage this  afternoon. We want  to  debate  education and education funding. This  chart  shows  where  the  Republican Party has been in the last 7 years on  education.  I  ask  unanimous  consent to have it printed in the RECORD. There  being  no  objection,  the  material  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the RECORD, as follows: REPUBLICAN HISTORY OF CUTTING FUNDING IN APPROPRIATIONS EDUCATION BILLS Fiscal year 1995 rescission  (House bill): \u00b7$1.7 billion (below enacted FY 1995) Fiscal  year  1996  (House  bill):  \u00b7$3.9  (below FY 1995) Fiscal  year  1997  (Senate  bill):  (below President\u2019s request) Fiscal  year  1998  (House  and  Senate  bill): \u00b7$200 million  (below President\u2019s request) \u00b7$3.1  billion billion Fiscal  year  1999  (House  bill):  (below President\u2019s request) Fiscal  year  2000  (House  bill):  (below President\u2019s request) Fiscal  year  2001  (House  bill):  (below President\u2019s request) \u00b7$2.8  \u00b7$2.9  \u00b7$2  billion billion billion MAN MAN vote There BINGAfor the Mr.  KENNEDY.  It  shows  they  have effectively  cut  education  every  single year in either the House appropriations committee  or  in  the  Senate.  The  only one  who  has  saved  the  education  budget  is  President  Clinton.  Do  you  hear that?  President  Clinton.  Respond  to these facts. We  ought  to  be  debating  the  elementary  and  secondary  education  bill  this afternoon. That is what Senator BINGAwants  to  do.  That  is  what  I  want to do. But, no; Republicans want  to debate  a  $250  billion  cut  for  400  of  the wealthiest  families.  That  is  what  we are spending time doing. These  are  the  wrong  priorities  America.  If we want  to  get  back  to  right  priorities  that  are  in  the  amendment,  Senators  will  with him when the time comes. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  are 30 seconds remaining. The Senator from Arkansas. Mr. HUTCHINSON. It seems ironic to me  when  we  had  the  education  bill  on the  floor  of  the  Senate  for  8  days,  the amendments  offered  by  the  other  side of  the  aisle  were  on  health  care  and campaign  finance  reform.  They  had nothing to do with education. Now  we  have  elimination  of  the  estate  tax  bill  on  the  floor  of  the  Senate and they want to talk about education. The  majority  leader  has  done  everything  in  his  power  to  give  an  opportunity  for  legitimate  education  debate and  to  pass  reauthorizing  of  ESEA. This  is a diversion, and all the protests will not change that fact. The death tax has been repealed  in 20 States since 1980. I say to Senator KENI  believe  the  Senate  ought  to  do what  his  home  State  of  Massachusetts did; we ought to abolish it. We ought to eliminate  it  as  Oregon,  as  Vermont,  as Canada,  as  Israel,  as  Australia.  We should  abolish  it\u2014not  tinker  with  it, not  play  with  it,  not  raise  the  cap.  We need to eliminate it. Senator  called  it  the  millionaire  tax  loophole.  That  is  why  the Black  Chamber  of  Commerce  has  endorsed  this  bill,  the  Hispanic  Chamber of  Commerce,  the  National  Indian  Association,  and  the  Pan  American Chamber  of  Commerce  have  endorsed it. We need to abolish the death tax. Mr.  BINGAMAN.  Mr.  President,  this amendment  is  focused  on  education.  It is  an  effort  to  put  our  priorities straight,  to  get  our  priorities  in  line with  the  priorities  of  the  American people,  to  get  back  to  talking  about how  do we  improve  the  lot  of  the  average American,  instead of  talking about the  lot of the 400 wealthiest  families  in the country. I  believe  this  will  put  funds  where they  are  needed  the  most,  where  the American  people  want  to  see  them spent.  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support this amendment. KENNEDY NEDY,  time BINGAMAN,  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  All  on the amendment has expired. Mr.  HUTCHINSON.  The  pending amendment  offered  by  the  Senator from  New  Mexico,  Mr.  will increase  the  spending  by  $11  billion. This  additional  spending  would  cause the  underlying  bill  to  exceed  the  finance  committee  section  302(b)  allocation. Therefore,  I  raise  a  point  of  order pursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget Act. Mr. BINGAMAN. Pursuant  to  section 904  of  the  Budget  Act,  I move  to  waive the  applicable  sections  of  the  act  for consideration  of  the  pending  amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.

The  portion  of  the  bill  I  have  is  a  bill that  I,  along  with  Senator  have  introduced,  with  32  other  cosponsors,  called  the  Conservation  Reserve Program  Tax  Fairness  Act.  What  it would  do  is  keep  conservation  reserve program  payments  from  being  subject to self-employment tax. Unfortunately, a circuit court  in  this country  determined  that  these  CRP payments  are  subject  to  that.  This  removes  that. That  is  in  the  bill. That  is why  I  support  my  colleague  from  Iowa and  urge my  colleagues  to  support  this amendment. Mr.  GRASSLEY.  Mr.  President,  I yield  myself  a  final  30  seconds  to  ask unanimous  consent  to  have  printed  in the  a  letter  in  support  of  the amendment  from  the  American  Farm Bureau Federation. There  being  no  objection,  the  letter was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the RECORD, as follows: DASCHLE, RECORD AMERICAN FARM BUREAU FEDERATION, Washington, DC. July 13, 2000. Hon. CHARLES U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. E. GRASSLEY, DEAR SENATOR GRASSLEY:  Farm  Bureau supports  a  proposed  amendment  to  add  several  key  agricultural  tax  provisions  to  H.R. 8,  the Death Tax Elimination Act of  2000.  Included  in  this  amendment  is  the  creation  of Farm and Ranch Risk Management Accounts (FARRM  accounts),  repeal  of  self-employment taxes on farmland rental, and clarification  that  farm  income  averaging  does  not trigger  the  Alternative  Minimum  Tax (AMT). Using  a  FARRM  Account,  producers  would be  able  to  save  up  to  20  percent  of  net  farm income  in  a  tax-deferred  account  where  the funds  could  be  held  in  reserve  for  up  to  five years  for  financial  emergencies.  Unpredictable weather and uncontrollable markets impact  supply  and  demand  making  farm  income  difficult  to  predict.  Serious  financial problems  can  arise  when  agricultural  producers are unable to cover expenses with current  income.  Farmers  and  ranchers  need  financial  management  tools  that  encourage savings  as  a  means  of  stabilizing  their  incomes. Recent  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  activities  have wrongly  broadened  the  application  of  the  self-employment  tax.  Until  1996, farmers  and  ranchers  paid  the  15.3  percent self-employment  tax  on  income  from  labor and  employment  as  intended  by Congress.  In that  year,  a  tax  court  case  expanded  the  tax to  include  income  from  the  cash  rental  of farmland. This was done even though the tax code  does  not  generally  require  nonagricultural  property  owners  to  pay  self-employment tax on cash rental receipts. Congress  enacted  three-year  averaging  for farm and  ranch  income  in  1997  to protect agriculture  producers  from  excessively  high tax  rates  in  profitable  year.  The  intended benefits  of  income  averaging,  however,  are being  eroded  by  the  imposition  of  the  Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) which limits tax savings  for  farmers  and  ranchers.  Producers most  at  risk,  those  whose  incomes  vary greatly  from  year  to  year,  are  hurt  most  by AMT-imposed  limits  on  farm  and  ranch  income averaging. Farm  Bureau  urges  your  support  for  the agricultural  tax  amendment  to  H.R.  8. Thank you for your consideration. BOB STALLMAN, President. Mr.  GRASSLEY.  Mr.  President,  No. 2,  I  remind  people  the  farmer  savings accounts  give  the  farmers  an  opportunity  to  level  out  years  of  high  income  versus  years  of  low  income. Very seldom,  because  of  nature,  can  the farmers  control  their  productivity  to any  great  extent,  so  they  have  these peaks  and  valleys.  This  gives  the  family  farmer  an  opportunity  to  manage his income to a greater extent. I yield the floor. AMENDMENT NO. 3835 (Purpose:  To  amend  the  Internal  Revenue Code  of  1986  to  increase  the  unified  credit exemption  and  the  qualified  family-owned business  interest  deduction,  to  provide  a refundable  credit  to  certain  individuals  for elective  deferrals  and  IRA  contributions, and  to  provide  an  incentive  to  small  business  to  establish  and  maintain  qualified pension  plans,  to  amend  the  Social  Security  Act  to  provide  each  American  child with a KidSave Account, and for other purposes) The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BAUCUS], DORGAN,  KERREY,  Mr.  BAUCUS.  Mr.  President,  I  ask unanimous  consent  that  the  reading  of the amendment be dispensed with. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Without objection, it is so ordered. (The  text  of  the  amendment  is  printed  in  today\u2019s  under  \u2018\u2018Amendments Submitted.\u2019\u2019) Mr.  BAUCUS.  Mr.  President,  this  is an  amendment  to  help  people  who  are not  now  putting  aside  money  for  their RECORD in  the KERREY KERREY,  retirement.  It  is  combined  with  measures  previously  addressed  by  the  Senator  from  Nebraska,  Mr.  with respect  to  KidSave.  It  is  a  combined amendment  along with  the Democratic estate  tax  alternative.  So,  like  other Democratic  amendments,  this  replaces the  estate  tax  provisions  in  the  House bill  with  the  estate  tax  relief  in  the Democratic alternative. As  I  said  before,  there  are  two  reasons  we  have  our  Democratic  alternative.  One,  it  provides  more  relief more  quickly  to  the  folks  who  really need  it;  that  is,  our  family  businesses, small businesses, ranchers and farmers; and  the  second  part  of  the  basic Democratic alternative amendment is it puts the  $40  billion  that  is  saved,  compared with  the  House-passed  bill,  to  better use.  Instead of providing  further  estate tax  relief  for  the  few  individuals  who, by any measure, are very well off\u2014that is,  the  top  portion  of  the  2  percent\u2014we decided  to  encourage middle-class  families  to  do  more  to  provide  for  their own retirement. We  give  every  child  a  stake  American  dream.  Senator  mentioned  the  phenomenon  of compounding  interest.  The  rule  of thumb  is that,  if you earn 7 percent  interest, your money will double every 10 years,  at  10  percent  interest,  your money  doubles  every  7  years.  You  can imagine  the  magic  of  compounding over a child\u2019s lifetime. Senator KERREY has  eloquently  described  that  portion of the amendment. I  will  explain  the  portion  that  is  the incentive  for  retirement  saving.  Why do  we  need  an  incentive?  Let  me  start by  pointing  out  that Social Security  is the  primary  source  of  income  for  twothirds of elderly Americans. We have to stop  and  think  about  that  just  a  second.  Social  Security  is  the  primary source  of  income  for  two-thirds  of  elderly  Americans.  That  is,  they  do  not have  other  sources  of  income  that amount  to  very much.  In  fact,  it  is  the only  source  of  income  for  about  16  percent of the elderly. For 16 percent, it is the only source. Those  of  us  who  offer  this  amendment  believe,  of  course,  we  must  protect  Social  Security.  I  think  everyone in this Chamber agrees with that statement.  But  I  also  believe  that  is  not enough.  We  must  complement  Social Security  by  helping  people  set  additional  savings  aside  because  Social  Security  is  not  enough.  Otherwise,  there are  far  too  many  Americans  who  will spend  their  retirement  years  just  one step away from poverty. So  our  goal  is  to  increase  pension savings,  retirement  savings,  in  addition  to  the  Social  Security  program. That is partly because America is not a nation  of  savers.  We  have  seen  all  the statistics.  Personal  savings  rates  have continually  declined  in  this  country. One-half  of  all  Americans  have  less than  $10,000  set  aside  for  retirement. Let  me  repeat  that.  One-half  of  all Americans  have  less  than  $10,000  set aside  for  retirement.  Obviously,  we need more.

Another  recent  study  actually  estimates  that  13.7  million  households have critical housing needs, including 6 million working and  3.7 million  elderly households. Moreover, there is not one metropolitan area  in  the  country where a person making  minimum  wage  can  afford  to pay  the  rent  for  a  two-bedroom  apartment.  A  person  needs  to  earn  over  $11 an hour to afford  the median  rent  for a two  bedroom  apartment  in  this  country.  This  figure  rises  dramatically  in many  metropolitan  areas:  an  hourly wage  of  $22  is needed  in San Francisco; $21 on Long Island; $17 in Boston; $16 in the  D.C.  area;  $14  in  Seattle  and  Chicago; and $13 in Atlanta. We  have  to  remember  that  there  are real  people  behind  these  numbers\u2014real people who are struggling to keep their families  housed  each  month.  The  stories are a  testament  to  the need  for  increased affordable housing. Let me give you a few. On  Cape  Cod,  Susan  O\u2019Donnell  a mother  of  three,  earns  $21,000  a  year working  full-time.  Nonetheless,  she  is forced  to  live  in  a  campground  because she  can  not  find  affordable  housing. The  campground  she  is  living  at  has time limits, so the only way she is able to  stay  for  a  prolonged  period  of  time is  through  cleaning  the  campground\u2019s toilets.  When  her  time  runs  out  at  the campground, she will again be forced to move  with  her  three  children,  though it  is not clear where she will be able to afford  to  move.  Skyrocketing  housing costs  have  pushed  her,  and  other  fulltime  workers  on  the  Cape  out  of  their housing and into homelessness. Janitors who work  at  high-tech  companies  in  Silicon  Valley  are  living  in egregious  conditions,  including  several large  families  living  in  single-family homes  and  others  renting  out  garages for  families  to  live  in\u2014garages  which can  cost  $750  a  month.  Maria  Godinez, of  San  Jose,  works  full  time  for  Sun Microsystems  making  $8  an  hour.  She shares  one  bedroom  of  a  single-family house  with  her  husband  and  five  children; 22 people live in that house. Not  too  far  from where we are  today, in  Fairfax  County,  VA,  Anita  Salathe and  her  two  children  live  in  a  shelter despite  her  having  a  job  and  a  voucher for assisted housing\u2014there  just are not enough  affordable  housing  units.  The homelessness  rate  in  Fairfax  County has  increased  by  21  percent  in  the  last two years. Full-time workers are living in shelters because their paychecks are not  rising  fast  enough  to  keep  pace with their growing housing costs. These  stories  are  all  too  common. As housing  costs  rise  around  America, more  working  families  are  being pushed closer to homelessness. Despite  these  abysmal  stories,  we have  decreased  Federal  spending  on critical  housing  programs  over  time. From  fiscal  year  1995  to  fiscal  year 1999,  we  engaged  in  what  I  call  the \u2018\u2018Great HUDway Robbery,\u2019\u2019 diverting or rescinding over $20 billion from Federal housing  programs  for  other  uses.  With a  few  exceptions,  the  funding  increases of  this  past  year  have  gone  primarily to  cover  the  rising  costs  of  serving  existing assisted families. Affordable  housing  units  are  being lost.  Between  1993  and  1995,  a  loss  of 900,000  rental  units  affordable  to  very low-income  families  occurred.  From 1996  to  1998,  there  was  a  19  percent  reduction  in  the  number  of  affordable housing units. This amounted  to a dramatic  reduction  of  1.3  million  affordable  housing  units  available  to  low-income Americans. We  need  to  bring  our  levels  of  housing  spending back up to where  they belong.  Between  1978  and  1995,  the  Government  increased  the  number  of households  receiving  housing  assistance  by  almost  3  million.  From  1978 through 1984, we provided an additional 230,000 families with housing assistance each year. This number dropped significantly  to  126,000  additional  households each year from 1985 to 1995. If  we  hoped  things  could  not  get worse, in 1996 this nations\u2019 housing policy hit a brick wall. Not only was there no  increase  in  families  receive  housing assistance,  but  the  number  of  assisted units  actually  decreased.  From  1996  to 1998,  the  number  of  HUD  assisted households  dropped  by  51,000.  In  this time  of  rising  rents  and  housing  costs, and  the  loss  of  affordable  housing units,  it  is  incomprehensible  that  we are  not  doing  more  to  bring  the  levels of  housing  assistance  back  from  the dead. It  is  high  time  that  we  focused  on housing  policies  in  Congress  and around  the  country.  Housing  is  an  anchor for families. When we focus our efforts  on  other  social  issues  like  education  and  health  care,  it  is  beyond comprehension  that  housing  does  not take a front seat in these discussions. It  is no  secret  that neighborhood and living  environment  play  enormous roles  in  shaping  young  lives.  It  should not  be  news  that  housing  assistance, which helps  a  family maintain  a  stable home,  is  positive  for  low-income  children.  We  know  that  a  child  can  not learn  if  he  has  to  attend  3  or  4  schools in  a  single  year,  if  his  family  moves from  relative  to  relative  to  friend  to friend  because  his  parents  can\u2019t  afford the rent. A  recent  study  conducted  by  Johns Hopkins  University  helps  to  show  that housing  assistance  is  beneficial.  Housing  assistance  makes  it  easier  to  get and  retain  a  job  by  providing  stability. We need to ensure that every American family  has  these  same  opportunities. We  need  to  address  the  lack  of  opportunity,  the  lack  of  affordable  housing. I  am  proposing  to  address  this  severe shortage  of  affordable  housing  by  establishing  a  National  Affordable  Housing  Trust  Fund.  While  we  are  considering  a  bill  which  allows  the  wealthy to  pass  on  large  estates  and  homes  to their  families,  let\u2019s  ensure  that  all Americans can afford a place to live. My  proposal  would  create  an  affordable  housing  production  program,  ensuring  that  new  rental  units  are  built for  those  who  most  need  assistance\u2014 extremely  low-income  families,  including  working  families.  In  addition, Trust  Fund  assistance  will  be  used  to promote  homeownership  for  low-income  families, those  families whose  incomes  are  below  80  percent  of  the  area median income. The  Trust  Fund  aims  to  create  longterm  affordable,  mixed-income  developments  in  areas  with  the  greatest  opportunities for low-income families. A  majority  of  assistance  from  the Trust Fund will be given out as matching grants to the States which will distribute  funds  on  a  competitive  basis like the low-income housing tax credit. Localities,  non-profits,  developers  and other  entities  will  be  eligible  to  apply for  funds.  The  remaining  25  percent  of the  Trust  Fund  assistance  will  be  distributed  through  a  national  competition  to  intermediaries,  such  as  large, national  non-profits  which  will  be  required to leverage private funds. This  proposal  will  bring  Federal, State and private resources together to create  needed  affordable  housing  opportunities for American families. When  we  allow  families  in  this  country  to  live  in  severely  distressed  housing,  or  in  situations  where  they  are forced  to  move  from  place  to  place, American  children  suffer\u2014they  have behavioral  problems,  they  suffer  from more  health  problems,  and  they  do worse  in  school.  I  think  the  American people  understand  that  helping  children  escape  these  problems  today  will pay  us  back  tenfold  in  the  years  to come.  I  think  the  American  people  understand  how we  can measure what  actually  counts  in  America.  I  think  they know that housing is more than a word or  a  government  program\u2014it  is  the quality  of  life\u2014it  is  how  we  measure our lives and it is how we ought to take the measure of our nation. I  urge  you  to  support  this  amendment  which  restores  our  commitment to  providing  affordable  housing  for  all families.  We  should  not  vote  to  ensure that  the  wealthiest  Americans  can  retain more of their incomes and estates, while  turning  our  back  on  those  families  who  struggle  each  month  just  to put a roof over their heads. Mr.  KENNEDY.  Mr.  President,  I strongly  support  Senator  KERRY\u2019s  proposal to create a housing trust  fund.

Mr.  DODD.  Mr.  President,  I  will  not take 2 minutes. As  my  colleague  notes,  this  amendment  would  make  the  child  care  tax credit  refundable\u2014that\u2019s  one  of  its strongest  points. My  friend  from Texas said  we  adopted  a  similar  provision  in the  tax  proposal  offered  by  the  Republicans a year or so ago. That\u2019s not true. It  was  not  refundable  and  would  not have  benefited  lower-income  families. There is a significant difference. Refundability  is  important  because as  it  stands  now  the  tax  break  we  are talking  about  is  not  terribly  meaningful  for  families  earning  less  than  $20\u2013 $25,000.  Refundability  is  the  only  way to help people in that income level. I mentioned earlier  that  I was  listening  to  a  woman  today  who  was  saying how happy she was that she found child care for one of her two children for $100 a  week.  That  is  $5,200  a  year.  She makes,  according  to  her,  about  $25,000 or  $30,000  a  year.  That  is  a  quarter  of her  gross  income  going  to  care  for  one child.  Without  refundability,  the  current  tax  credit  really  doesn\u2019t  mean much to her. It is simply inequitable to deny  her  a  tax  credit  that  families  at higher  incomes  with  the  same  type  of child care expenses enjoy. If  we  can  find  the  time,  as  we  have for  a  day  and  a  half,  to  debate  a  bill that would assist 43,000 or 44,000 people, can\u2019t we carve out a place  in a  $750 billion  tax  break  for  8  million  working people  in  this  country  who  are  trying to  raise  their  children  under  very  difficult  circumstances.  That  is  the  purpose of the amendment. I  suspect  it  does  suffer  a  potential point  of  order.  We  will  make  our  motion  at  the  time.  But  I  hope  my  colleagues will be supportive. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. DODD. I would be happy to yield. Mr. NICKLES.  If you are making  it a refundable  credit,  you  are  making  this more  of  a  priority  than  health  care. You  are  saying  this  is  a  more  important  item  than  food,  in  some  cases,  because  you  are  having  the  Federal  Government write a check to pay for it. We don\u2019t do that with health care. I  understand  your  desire  to  do  some things for child health care. We happen to  agree  with much  of  that  because  we I  I for ask  Without passed it last year in the bill the President vetoed. But now you are  trying  to make  it  refundable  by  having  Uncle Sam  write  a  check  for  it.  I  personally think  you  are  going  too  far  with  that amendment. Mr.  DODD.  Mr.  President,  an 15 additional seconds. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  objection, it is so ordered. Mr.  DODD.  My  point  is  this:  Raising children  in  this  country  in  affordable, decent  circumstances  is  about  as  basic as it gets. Eight million Americans can benefit  from  this amendment. This  is a good  investment  for  our  country.  With a  $750  billion  tax  break  for  43,000  people,  I  think  we  ought  to  be  able  to  do something  for  8  million  working  families with young children. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. GRAMM. Give me 30 seconds. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Without objection, 30 seconds. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what we are  talking  about  here  is  basically  a setting  of  priorities.  Do  we  want  to take money away  from eliminating the marriage  penalty  in  the  earned-income tax  credit  for  working  families  to  give a  tax  credit  for  a  noble  purpose?  In fact,  a  purpose  that  we  had  written into  our  tax  bill  last  year  that  the President  vetoed.  That  is  what  we  are debating: priorities. We  set  aside  the  $5  billion  in  the budget to  fund earned-income tax credit  for  the  elimination  of  the  marriage penalty.  If we  spend  it  here, we  cannot do it tomorrow.

(The  text  of  the  amendment  is  printed  in  today\u2019s  under  \u2018\u2018Amendments Submitted.\u2019\u2019) Mr.  ROTH.  Mr.  President,  I  rise  to offer  an  amendment  which  addresses  a very  important  topic  for  many  Americans\u2014retirement savings. Many  Americans,  especially Boomers,  increasingly  worry:  Will  I have  enough  to  live  on  when  I  retire? According  to  recent  studies,  one  third that IRA of  Americans  are  not  confident  that they  will  have  enough  to  live  on  in their  retirement  years,  and  for  others that  optimism  about  retirement  income may not be well founded. Savings\u2014whether  through  employer retirement  plans  or  as  personal  savings\u2014are  necessary  for  a  comfortable retirement. Overall  savings  by  Americans  are  at an  all  time  low.  The  U.S.  Department of  Commerce  stated  that  Americans\u2019 personal  savings  rate  for  the  first  half of 1999 fell below zero. I  believe,  and  many  economists agree,  that  increasing  tax  incentives for  savings will  result  in more  savings. The  amendment  I  offer  provides many  tax  incentives  which  will  result in  greater  savings.  Let me  outline  just a few of them. The  maximum  contribution  limit  for IRAs  both  traditional  IRAs  and  Roth IRAs  is  $2,000.  This  limit,  which  has been  in place since 1982, has never been indexed  for  inflation.  According  to  the Joint  Committee  on  Taxation,  If  the IRA  limit  were  indexed  for  inflation  it would be over $5,000. This  amendment  increases  the  contribution limit for all IRAs (both traditional  IRAs  and  Roth  IRAs)  to  $5,000 per year and under  that amount  for  inflation. It  is  important  to  remember  people  at  all  income  levels  make  contributions. An  estimated  26  percent  of  American households  now  own  a  traditional  IRA. In  1993  (the most  recent  year  for which comprehensive  aggregate  data  is  available)  52  percent  of  all  IRA  owners earned less than $50,000. We  know  that  people  at  all  income levels  are  limited  by  the  $2,000  cap  on contributions. For example, IRS statistics  show  that  the  average  contribution  level  in  1993  for  people  with  less than $20,000 in income was $1,500. Lower  income  people  clearly  want  to make  contributions  of  more  than  the $2,000 limit. This  amendment  also  increases  other benefit  limitations.  Currently,  the maximum  pre-tax  contribution  to  a 401(k) plan or a 403(b) annuity is $10,000. In  addition,  the  maximum  contribution to a 457(b) plan, a plan for employees  of  government  and  tax  exempt  organizations is $8,000. Finally,  the  maximum  contribution to  a  simple  plan,  a  simplified  defined contribution  plan  available  only  to small employers, is $6,000. This  amendment  increases  limits  for 401(k),  403(b)  and  457  plans  to  $15,000 and for simple plans to $10,000. This  does  not mean  that  business  executives  can  automatically  take  advantage  of  these  higher  contribution limits;  lower  income  employees  must benefit  in  order  for  the  executive  to benefit. Consequently,  business  owners  and high  paid  employees  cannot  benefit with  this  new  higher  contribution  limits  unless  the  amount  of  savings  that low  paid  people  make\u2014either  on  their VerDate 11-MAY-2000 05:48 Jul 14, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G13JY6.181 pfrm01 PsN: S13PT1 ",

You  can  go  to  a  lot  of  countries  that don\u2019t have taxes on estates. It is pretty easy  today  to  start  a  new  business  in high  technology.  You  can  go  to  other countries  easily  because  they want  the entrepreneurs;  they will welcome  them in  because  they  realize  that  is  the  engine  of  a  growing  economy,  and  it  is fantastic,  so  they  will  give  great  benefits. We  have  one  of  the  highest  estate taxes  in  the  world.  Some  of  my  colleagues  say:  Let\u2019s  only  have  it  on  the wealthy,  successful  people;  we  will really  sock  it  to  them.  I  think  that  is really  unfair.  The  Tax  Code  should  be uniform and  fair. As a matter of  fact,  I think  of  the  Constitution  where  I  read that  the  Tax  Code  should  be  uniform. Now  when  people  say  we  have  to  increase  the  exemption  so  much  that  we will  sock  it  to  the  wealthy,  the  rates already  at  55  percent\u201460  percent  for some Americans\u2014that  is way  too high. We  say,  wait  a  minute,  the  Tax  Code should  be  uniform.  Let\u2019s  eliminate  the tax  on  death  on  all  Americans\u2014not just  wealthy  Americans  but  on  all Americans\u2014and have the taxable event when  the  property  is  sold  on  wealthy Americans  as  well.  They  can  pay  20 percent  just  as  any  other  American does. To  me,  that  is  fair,  uniform  and, frankly,  would  probably  raise  more money  because  wealthy  people  have figured  out  lots  of  ways  to  get  around estate  taxes\u2014through  foundations  and other little gimmicks. They hire lots of attorneys  and  successful  people  and pay  them  lots  of  money  every  year  to make sure they pay no tax. It  would  be  very  interesting  to  know how much money  is  utilized\u2014some  say wasted\u2014but  generated  to  avoid  this tax  or  how  many  businesses  aren\u2019t  expanded to avoid this tax. If  my  colleague\u2019s  amendment  would pass,  how  many  successful  people would  flee  to  another  country  to  expand  their  business  and  grow  their business  so  they  would  not  be  faced with  the  situation  where  they  worked their  entire  life  for  success,  and  they happen  to  die,  and  Uncle  Sam  says: Thank  you  very much;  we  want  55  percent.  Thank  you  for  your  efforts,  but those  are  \u2018\u2018our\u2020  resources.  Ours?  The Government  didn\u2019t  build  that  company,  but  the  Government  is  entitled to over half of the estate. The power to tax is the power to destroy. I  urge  my  colleagues  to  this  amendment  at  the  time tomorrow. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  Senator  from  Wisconsin  has  5  minutes  26 seconds. Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in listening  to  the  Senator  from  Oklahoma, you  would  think  I  were  up  here  proposing  for  the  first  time  in  American vote  no  on appropriate history  that  we  implement  an  estate tax  or  that  perhaps  it  was  something created  in  the  heart  of  the  1960s  as  an extreme,  liberal  idea,  and  that  finally the  Republican majority  were  going  to eliminate it. That  isn\u2019t  the  truth  at  all.  The  fact is,  as  I  understand  it,  this  kind  of  tax has  been  around  for  about  a  hundred years.  When  the  Senator  from  Oklahoma  condemns  the  idea  of  having some  kind  of  limitation  on  a  tax  that has been there for decades and decades, in  fact,  I voted  for  it, and  I assume  the Senator  from  Oklahoma,  on  a  number of  occasions,  voted  for  increasing  the exemption.  He  has  not  taken  the  position  in  the  past  that  it  must  be  completely  eliminated;  otherwise,  it  is  not worth increasing the exemption. That  is  all  this  amendment  does.  It goes awfully high. My amendment says we  are  going  to  completely  eliminate the  estate  tax  in  estates  of  up  to  $100 million. In other words, this gentleman that  the  Senator  from  Oklahoma  is concerned  about  leaving  the  United States,  under  my  proposal,  would  have the  first  $100  million  of  his  estate  exempted.  If  he  is  going  to  take  off  after the  first  $100  million  is  exempted,  I really  question  his  business  judgment. He  has  to  leave  the  United  States  because  somehow  he  is  going  to  be  taxed over $100 million? Let\u2019s  face  it\u2014and  I  hate  to  use  this term\u2014but  when  you  start  talking about  over  $100  million  and  having  to pay  some  kind  of  tax,  just  as  people have always had to pay in this country, the word \u2018\u2018greed\u2019\u2019 comes to mind rather than  \u2018\u2018business  judgment.\u2019\u2019  There  is  no need  in  the  pressure  of  this  society  to provide  an  exemption  to  the  estate  tax on  over  $100  million.  It  would  be  absolutely  clear.  Under my  amendment,  up to $100 million is still covered. Why in the world can\u2019t people at that level  at  least  help  us  out  a  little  bit? Under current law, they are not getting this  break  anywhere  near  this  level. But  I  am  suggesting  once  we  hit  this extreme  level,  the  real  extreme  idea here  is  to  have  no  estate  tax  at  all. That is the point. The  question  is,  What  should  the  exemption  level  be?  I  am  suggesting there  is number up  in the stratosphere. It  is  just absurd  to provide  this kind of benefit. I  would  suggest  that  almost  any  average  American  you  would  ask  would say,  sure,  if  somebody  is  at  that  level, it  is  reasonable  and  fair  to  say  they ought to pay some estate tax. That  is  all  this  amendment  do. I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, again, I want  to  be  very  clear.  I  can  think  of  a female  entrepreneur  in  Oklahoma building  a  business.  It  has  been  very successful.  She  built  it  basically  from scratch. I am going to guess it is worth $100  million.  For  this  hypothetical  example,  it  is worth  $100 million.  I  bet  it tries  to is What  is. This business has worldwide sales  in pies.  She  will  know  who  I  am  talking about. They have had great success. The  value  of  that  company  probably 20  years  ago  was  probably  less  than  $1 million.  Today,  for  this  purpose,  it  is worth $100 million. Let\u2019s  say  she  is  the  sole  owner  of  the company  and  she  dies.  Under  the  Democrat  proposal  of  my  colleague  from Wisconsin, the tax would be 55 percent. Once  you  get  to  the  higher  levels,  you don\u2019t  get  to  phase  in.  That  is  $55  million\u201455 percent. Under  his  proposal,  also  you  would lose the stepped-up basis, which is kind of complicated. Basically, it means you go  back  to  the  zero  basis  of  what  it was. Since  the  value  was  almost  $1  million,  or  nothing,  20  years  ago,  you  are going to have to pay another 20 percent on  top  of  that.  For  this  $100  million corporation,  say,  her  sole  survivor who wants  to  inherit  this  company  and keep  it running has  to pay a tax bill  in the  neighborhood  of  about  $75  million out of a $100 million company. What  is  right  about  that?  fair about that? Nothing, zero. Again, taxes should be uniform. They should be fair. This  amendment  is  written  to  demagog. This amendment says: Yes. These tax cuts are really going to benefit people making even over $100 million. My point  is that the Tax Code should be fair and uniform. If we are not going to  have  death  taxes,  they  should  not apply  to  anybody.  Conversely,  if  we eliminate  the  tax  on  death  for  everybody,  including  the  people  over  $100 million  and  under  $100  million,  all would pay capital gains. So when and if that  business  is  sold  there  would  be  a capital  gains  tax.  It  would  be  20  percent.  If  you  have  a  $100  million  business,  or  gain  in  property,  and  they  sell it,  the  Federal  Government  would  get $20 million. Isn\u2019t  that  enough?  Why  in  the  world would  my  colleague  think  the  Federal Government  under  present  law  and under  my  colleague\u2019s  proposal  should get  over  50  percent?  Why  would  the Federal  Government  be  entitled  to  60 percent  or  75  percent  of  that  business under  his  proposal?  He  taxes  them twice. Under  the  proposal  of  my  colleague from  Wisconsin,  the  estate  would  pay twice:  once  at  the  death  based  on  the appraised  value,  and  again  when  the asset  is  sold  without  a  stepped-up basis. You  couldn\u2019t  be  more  unfair.  If  you are going to go to 75 percent, why don\u2019t you make it 100 percent? This  idea  of  it  being  the  resource  of the  Government  when  somebody  dies belongs  in  the  Kremlin.  It  doesn\u2019t  belong in the United States. I  urge  my  colleagues  to  this amendment. Mr.  ROTH.

Mr.  President,  the 20th  century  story  of  the  Shanin  Family  portrays  the  success  of  immigrants in America  and  the  success  of America itself. The  naturalization  papers  of  Freda Mermorvich  Shanin  show  that  she traveled  from  Lugansk,  Russia  and  arrived at Ellis Island on October 31, 1906, with  her  two  children,  Lilli  and  Max, enroute  to  joining  her  husband,  Mordecai  Shanin,  in  St.  Joe,  MO.  The Shanin  Family  grew  with  the  addition of  five  more  children:  Annie,  Louie, Rose,  Albert,  and  Margaret.  Mordecai Shanin  struggled  to  earn  a  living  with a  variety  of  occupations  including  selling Singer sewing machines. Lilli  Shanin,  later  to  become  my mother, told me about her father dying in her arms  form a heart attack  in 1916 on  the  backstairs  of  the  Shanin  home at  922  South  Ninth  Street.  My  grandmother, Bubbie Freda,  told me  she was left  a  widow  with  seven  children  and seven  dollars.  Deeply  religious,  proud and  independent,  Freda  Shanin  raised her children with  the help of Lilli, who left  school  to  work  in  a  tablet  factory, and the other siblings pitching  in when they  became  old  enough  to  contribute to the family\u2019s support. In 1917 Freda Shanin met a young immigrant,  Harry  Specter,  who  was  buying  dry  goods  and  blankets  at  the wholesale  house  for  sales  in  his  travels to  farms  in Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri.  Harry  Specter  asked  Freda Shanin  if  she  had  a  daughter.  \u2018\u2018Yes  I do\u2019\u2019  said  the  protective  mother,  \u2018\u2018But she\u2019s too young for you.\u2019\u2019 Harry  Specter  courted  Lilli  Shanin, won her heart, went off to World War I, was  wounded  in  the  Argonne  Forest, and  returned  in  uniform  to  St.  Joe  to marry  the  beautiful  19-year-old  redhead  in  her  resplendent  white  gown carrying a  large bouquet of  roses. That union produced Morton, Hilda, Shirley, and  who  in  turn brought  Mordecai  and  Freda  Shanin  10 great  grandchildren,  25  great-great grandchildren  and  6  great-great-great grandchildren. The  three  sons,  Max,  Louie,  and  Albert  grew  up  in  hard  times  in  St.  Joe with  Albert,  who  added  a  granddaughter  to  the  family  tree,  becoming a  prosperous  pharmacy  owner  who spent  much  of  his  time  and  drugstore medicines devoted to his ailing mother. Annie, who wrote a book of Hebrew poetry  in  1945,  married  a  distinguished chemist, Dr. Morton Kleiman, and they in turn had Dr. Adina Kleiman, a noted psychologist,  and  Dr.  Jay  Kleiman,  an SPECTER,  ARLEN eminent  cardiologist,  who  added  two more  great  grandchildren  to  the Shanin  family.  Margaret  \u2018\u2018Mashie\u2019\u2019 Shanin  married  handsome  Leslie  Hoffman,  who  brought  a  truckload  of  watermelons  from  the  family  produce business in Waco, TX, to St. Joe. Mashie  added  to  the  family  tree  with  four grandchildren  and  two  great-grandchildren. Rose Shanin left St. Joe at the age of 18 to live with her sister, Lilli, in Wichita, where Rose became a high-powered executive secretary for the Beyer Grain Company.  In  1930,  at  my  birth,  Tante Rose  intervened  to  save  me  from  the name  \u2018\u2018Abraham\u2019\u2019  with  the  suggested \u2018\u2018Arlen\u2019\u2019  after  the  famous  movie  star, Richard  Arlen.  Rose  would  later  start my  brother  Morton  and  me  in  the  development  of  our  work  ethics  as  messengers  riding  our  bicycles  all  over Wichita  delivering  bills  of  lading  for Beyer  and  other  grain  companies. Rose married  Julius  Isenberg  and  added  a daughter and son to the growing family tree. Judaism  has  continued  to  be  the mainstay  of  the  Shanin  Family  with many,  albeit  not  all,  maintaining strictly  kosher  homes,  with  a  few  emigrants  to  Jerusalem  and  Tel  Aviv  to strengthen  the  State  of  Israel.  The  70 descendants  of  Mordecai  and  Freda Shanin  have  contributed  to  the  values, prosperity,  and  success  of  the  United States.  Interspersed  in  the  family  tree are  Ph.Ds,  LL.Ds,  MDs,  a  Federal judge,  businesspeople,  professionals, and elected public officials. Today,  members  of  the  Shanin  Family have assembled  in Washington  for a Shanin  Family  reunion  led  by  the  matriarchs  of  the  family,  Annie  Kleiman and  Rose  Isenberg  and  Joyce  Specter, who  were  privileged  to  meet  with  the President  today. The  entire  family  visited  the  White  House,  the  Senate,  the Washington  Monument,  the  Jefferson Memorial,  the  Lincoln  Monument, President  Kennedy\u2019s  gravesite,  and  the Secret Service headquarters. America  is  the  spectacular  story  of immigrants who have come in search of freedom and opportunity who have contributed  so  much.  The  Shanin  Family is  typical of  the great  contributions by immigrants,  who,  along  with  native Americans,  have  made  the  United States  the  greatest  country  in  the  history of the world. Mr. REID. Mr. President,  I wanted  to say  this  to  the  Senator  from  Pennsylvania.  Not  only  is  he  proud  of  his  family,  but  certainly  they  should  be  proud of  him.  He  has  rendered  great  service to  the  State  of  Pennsylvania  and  to this  country.  Even  though  we  are  in  a real  quandary  for  time  here,  every word  he  said  I  appreciate  very  much.  I understand  the  pride  he  expresses  in his family, as they should in him. Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr.  President,  I  believe  it  is  probably  the  case,  although we  are  not  supposed  to  mention  such things  on  the  floor,  that  the  family may  be  present.  I  welcome  them  and congratulate  the  Senator  on  such  a fine progeny. Mr.  SPECTER.  I  thank  my  colleagues for their very kind remarks. Mr.  ROTH.  Mr.  President,  I  join  my colleagues  and  say  to  the  Senator\u2019s family  what  pride  they  should  take  in you. I know of no Senator that has had a  more  positive  affect  on  the  work  of the  Senator  than  Senator  I am proud of him. Mr.  SPECTER.  I  thank  my  leagues  from  Delaware  for  those  generous comments. SPECTER.  colvery IN FUNDING  FOR  THE  ARTS  SOUTH  DAKOTA Mr.  JOHNSON.  Mr.  President,  I would  like  to  briefly  express  my  full support  for  the  funding  contained  in the  fiscal  year  2001  Interior  Appropriations  bill  for  the  National  Endowment for  the Arts  (NEA). Yesterday,  I  joined 72  of  my  Senate  colleagues\u2014Republicans  and  Democrats  alike\u2014in  defeating  an  effort  to  cut  the  NEA\u2019s  budget. The  funding  level  approved  in  the  Senate  version  of  the  Interior  Appropriations  bill  is  $7  million  above  that  approved by the House of Representatives and  represents  a  modest  increase  from last year\u2019s budget. Opponents  of  the  NEA  claim  that  it simply  subsidizes  a  small  number  of wealthy  people  in  the  big  cities.  The truth  is  that  the  NEA  supports  publicprivate  art  projects  that  benefit  millions  of  people  across  our  country; young and old, rich and poor, rural and urban. One needs  to  simply  look  at  the NEA\u2019s role  in South Dakota to see how a  small  percentage  of  our  tax  dollars improve  the  lives  of  entire  communities in our state. Last  year,  South  Dakota  received over  $630,000  in  grants  from  the  NEA. That  equates  to  nearly  one  dollar  for every resident of our state. NEA grants are  coordinated  by  the  South  Dakota Arts  Council,  and  this  successful  federal-local-private  relationship  supports programs  like  the  L.  Frank  Baum  Oz Festival  in  Aberdeen.  NEA  funds  were instrumental  in  getting  the  Washington  Pavilion  of  Arts  and  Sciences constructed  in Sioux Falls.  In  fact,  the Black  Hills  Community  Theatre  and the  Black  Hills  Symphony  Orchestra provide  year-long  entertainment  as  a direct  result  of  NEA  funds.  Residents of  Brookings  benefitted  from  NEA funding  of  the  Brookings  Chamber Music  Society,  the  SDSU-Civic  Symphony,  and  the  Prairie  Repertory  Theatre.  Restoration  of  the  Historic Homestake  Opera  House  in  Lead  has been  supported  through  the  NEA.  In Pierre,  NEA  funds  have  allowed  the Capital  City  Children\u2019s  Chorus  to  entertain  area  residents.  Vermillion\u2019s historic  Shrine  to  Music  Museum  receives  NEA  support  for  its  annual  programs,  and Watertown\u2019s Symphony Orchestra  and  Town  Players  theater group  also  received  NEA  funds  this past  year.  I  just  returned  from  attending  a  performance  of  \u2018\u2018Spiritscapes\u2019\u2019,  a South  Dakota  cantata,  at  the  Sioux Falls  Washington  Pavilion  which  was financed in part by the NEA.

The  Early  Learning  Opportunities Act builds on existing state and federal efforts  by  expanding  the  range  of  programs,  the  types  of  activities,  and  the populations  served  by  other  early learning  initiatives. Current  federal  efforts  focused  on  early  childhood  learning  promote  programs  that  provide full-  or  part-day  out  of  home  care  and education. Rather  than  duplicate  these programs, the Early Learning Opportunities  Act  places  its  emphasis  on  helping  parents  and  other  caretakers  increase  their  abilities  to  support  positive child development. The  Early  Learning  Opportunities Act will provide funding for parent support  programs.  Parents  are  their child\u2019s  most  important  teachers.  Before anyone thinks about kindergarten, teaching  the  alphabet,  or  counting  the number  of  blocks  in  a  tower,  children are  learning  from  their  parents.  When a  parent  talks  and  sings  to  an  infant, the  baby  is  learning  about  sounds  and words  as  a  method  of  communication. When  children  are  fed  and  then  rocked to  sleep,  they  learn  about  security  and love,  which  will  contribute  to  their sense  of  self  and  autonomy.  Long  before  they  walk  through  the  schoolhouse  door,  children  have  learned  important  lessons  from  their  parents  and others  who  have  taken  care  of  them during the first few years of life. Funding  for  the  Early  Learning  Opportunities Act can be used to promote effective  parenting  and  family  literacy through  a  variety  of  community-based programs,  services  and  activities.  If parents  are  actively  engaged  in  their child\u2019s  early  learning,  their  children will  see  greater  cognitive  and  non-cognitive  benefits.  While  all  parents  want their  children  to  grow  up  happy  and healthy,  few  are  fully  prepared  for  the demands  of  parenthood.  Many  parents have  difficulty  finding  the  information and  support  they  seek  to  help  their children  grow  to  their  full  potential. Making  that  information  and  support available  and  accessible  to  parents  is  a key  component  of  the  Early  Learning Opportunities Act. Early  Learning  Opportunities  Act funds  can  be  used  to  provide  training for  child  care  providers  on  early  childhood  development,  child  safety,  and other skills that improve the quality of child  care.  For  many  families  it  is  not possible for a parent to remain home to care  for  their  children.  Their  employment  is  not  a  choice,  but  an  essential part  of  their  family\u2019s  economic  survival.  And  for  most  of  these  families, child  care  is  not  an  option,  but  a  requirement,  as  parents  struggle  to meet the  competing  demands  of  work  and family.  Just  as  it  is  essential  that  we provide  parents  with  the  tools  they need  to  help  their  children  grow  and develop,  we  also  must  help  the  people who  care  for  our  nation\u2019s  children while parents are at work. States  can  use  a  portion  of  the  funds made  available  for  the  Early  Learning Opportunities  Act  for  statewide  initiatives,  such  as  wage  and  benefit  subsidies  which  encourage  child  care  staff recruitment  and  incentives  to  increase staff  retention  Today,  more  than  13 million  young  children\u2014including  half of  all  infants\u2014spend  at  least  part  of their  day  being  cared  for  by  someone other  than  their  parents.  In  Vermont alone,  there  are  about  22,000  children, under  the  age  of  six,  in  state-regulated child care. The  Early  Learning  Opportunities Act  will  improve  local  collaboration and coordination among child care providers,  parents,  libraries,  community centers,  schools,  and  other  community service providers. By assessing existing resources  and  identifying  local  needs, the community organizations receiving funds  will  serve  as  a  catalyst  for  the more  effective  use  of  early  learning dollars  and  the  removal  of  barriers that  prevent  more  children,  parents and  caretakers  from  participating  in good  programs.  Parents  and  child  care providers  will  be  able  to  access  more services,  activities  and  programs  that help them care for children. An  investment  in  early  learning today will save money tomorrow. Many of  America\u2019s  children  enter  school without the necessary abilities and maturity.  Without  successful  remediation efforts,  these  children  continue  to  lag behind  for  their  entire  academic  career. We  spend billions of dollars on  efforts  to  help  these  children  catch  up. Research  has  demonstrated  that  for each  dollar  invested  in  quality  early learning  programs,  the  federal  government  can  save  over  five  dollars.  These savings  result  from  future  reductions in  the  number  of  children  and  families who  participate  in  federal  government programs  like  Title  I,  special  education, and welfare. The  Early  Learning  Opportunities Act  is designed  to be  locally controlled and  driven  by  the  unique  needs  of  each community.  The  legislation  authorizes $3.25  billion  in  discretionary  funding over  three  years  for  early  learning block grants to states. The bill ensures that  the  majority  of  the  funds  will channeled  through  the  states  to  local councils. The councils are charged with assessing  the  early  learning  needs  of the  community,  and  distributing  the funds  to  a  broad  variety  of  local  resources  to  meet  those  needs.  In Vermont,  the  Success  by  Six  initiative has  demonstrated  the  importance  of placing  the  resources  and  responsibilities at the local community level. The  Early  Learning  Opportunities Act  will  serve  as  a  catalyst  to  engage diverse sectors of the community in increasing programs, services, and activities  that  promote  the  healthy  development  of  our  youngest  citizens.  Funds may  be  used  by  the  local  councils  in  a variety  of  ways:  to  support  reading readiness  programs  in  libraries,  parenting  classes  at  the  local  health  center,  parent-child  recreation  programs in  the  park,  and  child  development classes  at  the  school.  Access  to  existing  early  learning  programs  can  be  increased by expanding the days or times that  young  children  are  served,  by  increasing the number of children served, or  by  improving  the  affordability  of programs  for  low-income  children. Transportation  can  be  provided  to  increase  participation  in  early  learning programs,  activities  and  services.  By keeping  the  use  of  the  funds  flexible, local  councils  can  work  with  parents, health  care  professionals,  educators, child care providers, recreation specialists,  and  other  groups  and  individuals in  the  community  to  create  an  affordable, accessible network of early  learning activities. The  Early  Learning  Opportunities Act  will  help  parents  and  care  givers who  are  looking  for  better  ways  to  integrate  positive  learning  experiences into  the  daily  lives  of  our  youngest children.  When  children  enter  school ready  to  learn,  all  of  the  advantages  of their  school  experiences  are  opened  to them\u2014their  opportunities  are  unlimited.  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support and  co-sponsor  the  \u2018\u2018Early  Learning Opportunities  Act  of  2000\u2019\u2019.  I  urge  you to  give  our  nation\u2019s  children  every  opportunity  to  succeed  in  school  and  in life. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our bipartisan  goal  in  introducing  The  Early Learning  Opportunities  Act  is  to  provide  greater  support  for  parents  across the  country  in preparing  their  children for  a  lifetime  of  learning,  beginning  at the earliest age. I  commend  Senators  JEFDODD,  and  for their  support  and  leadership  in  developing  this  legislation  and  in  seeing  to it  that  children\u2019s  voices  are  heard  and their  needs  are  a  priority  in  this  Congress.  Senator  and  I  have worked  together  to  improve  early learning  opportunities  in  Massachusetts,  and  this  national  initiative  is based  in  part  on  successful  models  in our  state.  Senator  has  been  an outstanding  leader  on  children\u2019s  issues for many  years. Senator  the chairman of our Senate committee, has shown great  skill and determination  in shaping this legislation, and in keeping our  committee  focused  on  the  important  issue  of  early  learning.  Senator has  been  an  essential  ally throughout  the  development  of  this bill,  as  has  the  senior  Senator  from Alaska.  Senator  and  I  introduced  the  Early  Learning  Trust  Fund Act as a predecessor to this legislation, and  he  was  a  leader  in  obtaining  approval  of  $8.5  billion  for  early  learning in this year\u2019s Senate budget resolution. Clearly,  the  need  for  this  legislation is  urgent.  Today\u2019s  families  are  legitimately  worried  about  the  quality  of care  provided  to  their  infants  and  toddlers while  the  parents  are  at work.  Of mothers  with  children  aged  zero  to five, a record 64 percent worked outside the  home  in  1999.  The  average  cost  of care  for  each  of  these  children  is  four STEVENS,  KERRY JEFFORDS,  FORDS,  DOMENICI,  KERRY DODD DOMENICI STEVENS VerDate 11-MAY-2000 06:04 Jul 14, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G13JY6.085 pfrm01 PsN: S13PT1 ",

One  such  initiative\u2014the  Pediatric  Research  Initiative\u2014would  help ensure  that  more  of  the  increased  research  funding  at  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  is  invested  specifically in children\u2019s health research. While  children  represent  close  to  30 percent  of  the  population  of  this  country,  NIH  devotes  only  about  12  percent of its budget to children, and, in recent years,  that  proportion  has  been  declining  even  further.  We  must  reverse  this disturbing  trend.  It  simply  makes  no sense  to  conduct  health  research  for adults  and  hope  that  those  findings also will apply to children.

The  fact  is  that  children  have medical  conditions  and  health  care needs  that  differ  significantly  from adults. Children\u2019s health deserves more attention  from  the  research  community.  That\u2019s  why  the  Pediatric  Research  Initiative  is  such  an  important part  of  the  \u2018\u2018Children\u2019s  Public  Health Act.\u2019\u2019  It  would  provide  the  federal  support  for  pediatric  research  that  is  so vital  to  ensuring  that  children  receive the  appropriate  and  best  health  care possible. The  Pediatric  Research  Initiative would  authorize  $50  million  annually for  the  next  five  years  for  the Office  of the Director of NIH  to  conduct,  coordinate,  support,  develop,  and  recognize pediatric research. By doing so, we will be  able  to  ensure  that  researchers  target  and  study  child-specific  diseases. With  more  than  20  Institutes  and  Centers  and  Offices  within  NIH  that  conduct,  support,  or  develop  pediatric  research  in  some  way,  this  investment would  promote  greater  coordination and  focus  in  children\u2019s  health  research and  should  encourage  new  initiatives and areas of research. The  \u2018\u2018Children\u2019s  Public  Health  Act\u2019\u2019 also  would  authorize  funding  through the National  Institutes  of Child Health and  Human  Development  (NICHD)\u2014for pediatric  research  training  grants  to support  training  for  additional  pediatric research scientists and would provide  funding  for  loan  forgiveness  programs.  Trained  researchers  are  essential  if  we  are  to  make  significant  advances  in  the  study  of  pediatric  health care,  especially  in  light  of  the  new  and improved  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  policies  that  encourage  the testing  of  medications  for  use  by  children. Additionally,  the  \u2018\u2018Children\u2019s  Public Health  Act\u2019\u2019  includes  the  \u2018\u2018Children\u2019s Asthma  Relief  Act,\u2019\u2019  which  Senator and  I  introduced  last  year. The sad  reality  for  children  is  that  asthma is  becoming  a  far  too  common  and chronic  childhood  illness.  From  1979  to 1992,  the  hospitalization  rates  among children  due  to  asthma  increased  74 percent.  Today,  estimates  show  that more  than  seven  percent  of  children DURBIN now  suffer  from  asthma.  Nationwide, the  most  substantial  prevalence  rate increase  for  asthma  occurred  among children  aged  four  and  younger.  Those four and younger also were hospitalized at  the  highest  rate  among  all  individuals with asthma. According  to  1998  data  from  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  (CDC),  my home  state of Ohio  ranks about  17th  in the  estimated  prevalence  rates  for asthma.  Based  on  a  1994  CDC  National Health  Interview  Survey,  an  estimated 197,226 children under 18 years of age in Ohio suffer from asthma. This is a serious  health  concern  among  children\u2014 and we must address it. The  \u2018\u2018Children\u2019s  Public  Health  Act\u2019\u2019 would  help  ensure  that  children  with asthma  receive  the  care  they  need  to live  healthy  lives.  The  bill  would  authorize  $50  million  annually  for  five years  for  the  Secretary  of  Health  and Human Services  (HHS) to award grants to  eligible  entities  to  develop  and  expand  projects  that  would  provide  asthma  services  to  children.  These  grants also  may  be  used  to  equip  mobile health care clinics that provide asthma diagnosis  and  asthma-related  health care  services; educate  families on asthma  management;  and  identify  and  enroll uninsured children who are eligible for,  but  are  not  receiving  health  coverage under Medicaid or the State Children\u2019s  Health  Insurance  Program (SCHIP).  The  ability  to  identify  and enroll  children  in  these  programs  will ensure  that  children  with  asthma  receive the care they need. Since  research  shows  that  children living  in  urban  areas  suffer  from  asthma  at  such  alarming  rates  and  that  allergens,  such  as  cockroach  waste,  contribute to the onset of asthma, this bill also  adds  urban  cockroach  management  to  the  current  preventive  health services  block  grant  which  currently can be used for rodent control. To  better  coordinate  federal  activities related to asthma, the Secretary of HHS  would  be  required  to  identify  all federal  programs  that  carry  out  asthma  research  and  develop  a  federal  plan for  responding  to  asthma.  To  better monitor  the  prevalence  of  pediatric asthma  and  to  determine  which  areas have  the  greatest  incidences  of  children  with  asthma,  this  bill  would  require  the  CDC  to  conduct  local  asthma surveillance  activities  to  collect  data on  the  prevalence  and  severity  of  asthma and to publish data annually on the prevalence rates of asthma among children  and  on  the  childhood  mortality rate.  This  surveillance  data  will  help us  better  detect  asthmatic  conditions, so  that we  can  treat more  children and ensure  that  we  are  targeting  our  resources  in  an  effective  and  efficient way  to  reverse  the  disturbing  trend  in the  hospitalization  and  death  rates  of asthmatic children. Finally,  Mr.  President,  the  bill  we are  introducing  today  includes  language  that  I  strongly  support  to  re-authorize funding for children\u2019s hospitals\u2019 Graduate  Medical  Education  (GME) programs  for  four  additional  years. Last  year,  as  part  of  the  \u2018\u2018Health  Care Research  and  Quality  Act,\u2019\u2019  which  was signed  into  law,  we  authorized  funding for  two  years  for  children\u2019s  hospitals\u2019 GME  programs.  The  teaching  mission of  these  hospitals  is  essential.  Children\u2019s  hospitals  comprise  less  than  one percent  of  all  hospitals,  yet  they  train five percent of all physicians, nearly  30 percent of all pediatricians, and almost 50  percent  of  all  pediatric  specialists. By  providing  our  nation  with  highly qualified  pediatricians,  children\u2019s  hospitals  can  offer  children  the  best  possible  care  and  offer  parents  peace  of mind.  They  serve  as  the  health  care safety  net  for  low-income  children  in their  respective  communities  and  are often  the  sole  regional  providers  of many  critical  pediatric  services.  These institutions also serve as centers of excellence  for  very  sick  children  across the nation. Federal funding for GME in children\u2019s  hospitals  is  a  sound  investment  in  children\u2019s  health  and  provides stability  for  the  future  of  the  pediatric workforce. Mr.  President,  as  the  father  of  eight children  and  the  grandfather  of  five,  I firmly  believe  that  we  must  move  forward  to  protect  the  interests\u2014and  especially  the  health\u2014of  all  children. The  \u2018\u2018Children\u2019s  Public  Health  Act  of 2000\u2019\u2019 makes crucial  investments  in our country\u2019s  future\u2014investments  that will  yield  great  returns.  If  we  focus  on improving  health  care  for  all  children today,  we  will  have  a  generation  of healthy adults tomorrow. I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  vital children\u2019s health care bill. this (for  himself,  By  Mr.  KENNEDY,  DASCHLE,  HATCH  Mr. Mr.  Mr. Mr.  Mr. LIEBERMAN, and Mr. SCHUMER): S. 2869. A bill to protect religious liberty,  and  for  other  purposes;  read  the first time. HUTCHINSON,  BENNETT,  RELIGIOUS LAND USE AND PERSONS ACT INSTITUTIONALIZED OF 2000 Mr.  HATCH.  Mr.  President,  I  rise today  to  introduce  a  narrowly  focused bill that protects religious liberty from unnecessary  governmental  interference.  It  will  provide  protection  for houses  of  worship  and  other  religious assemblies  from  restrictive  land  use regulation  that  often  prevents  the practice  of  faith.  This  legislation  also allows  institutionalized  persons  to  exercise  their  religion  to  the  extent  that it does not undermine the security, discipline,  and  order  of  their  institutions. Seven  years  ago,  recognizing  the need  to  strengthen  the  fundamental right  of  religious  liberty,  Congress overwhelmingly  passed  the  Religious Freedom  Restoration  Act  (RFRA).  Unfortunately,  in  1997,  in  the  case  of  City of Boerne v. Flores, the Supreme Court held  that  Congress  lacked  the  authority  to  enact  RFRA  as  applied  to  state and  local  governments.  In  an  attempt to  respond  to  the Boerne decision,  I  introduced  S.  2081  earlier  this  year.

ADDTIONAL  BUDGET  RESOURCES  FOR A  MEDICARE  PRESCRIPTION  DRUG BENEFIT PROGRAM. folthe  makes  Senate  (a)  FINDINGS.\u2014The  lowing findings: (1)  Beneficiaries  under  the  medicare  program  under  title  XVIII  of  the  Social  Security  Act  (42  U.S.C.  1395  et  seq.)  are  the  only group  of  insured  Americans  without  prescription drug coverage. (2)  At  any  point  in  time,  approximately 13,000,000  medicare  beneficiaries  are  without prescription drug coverage. (3)  Over  the  course  of  a  year,  nearly 20,000,000  medicare  beneficiaries  are  without prescription  drug  coverage  for  all  or  part  of the year. (4) The options available to medicare beneficiaries  for  obtaining  prescription  drug  coverage are declining since\u2014 (A) the number of employers providing employer-sponsored  retiree  coverage  is  declining at a dramatic rate; (B) Medicare+Choice  plans  that might  otherwise  provide  prescription  drug  coverage are  pulling  out  of  counties  throughout  the Nation; and (C)  medicare  supplemental  policies (medigap  policies)  that  offer  prescription drug  coverage  are  so  prohibitively  expensive that only  8 percent of medicare beneficiaries have the means to purchase such policies. (5)  An  elderly  individual  without  prescription  drug  coverage  living  on  $12,525  a  year (150 percent of the Federal poverty line), who has  diabetes,  hypertension,  and  high  cholesterol,  pays  more  than  18.3  percent  of  their total  income  on  the  prescription  drugs  most commonly  prescribed  to  treat  their  medical conditions. (6)  Medicare  beneficiaries  should  never have  to  make  the  choice  between  having  a roof  over  their  head,  having  food  in  their mouth,  or  having  necessary  prescription drugs. (7)  Congress  must  provide  medicare  beneficiaries  with  a  meaningful  medicare  prescription drug benefit that\u2014 (A) is universal and affordable; (B)  guarantees  stable  coverage  for  medicare  beneficiaries  receiving  benefits  through the  original  fee-for-service  program  or through  enrollment  in  a  Medicare+Choice plan; and (C)  provides  protections. (8)  Meaningful  prescription  drug  coverage includes  stop-loss  protection  above  $4,000  of out-of-pocket  expenses  for  prescription drugs. (9) In March 2000, the Congressional Budget Office  estimated  the  on-budget  surplus  for the  5-year  period  of  fiscal  year  2001  through fiscal  year  2005  to  be  $148,000,000,000,  assuming  that  discretionary  spending  was  allowed to increase with inflation. (10)  Relying  on  the  March  2000  estimate  of the Congressional Budget Office,  on April  12, 2000,  Congress  passed  the  concurrent  resolution  on  the  budget  for  fiscal  year  2001  which allocated  $40,000,000,000  of  the  estimated  onbudget  surplus  for  the  5-year  period  described  in  paragraph  (9)  to  provide  a  prescription  drug  benefit  for  medicare  beneficiaries. (11)  Forty  billion  dollars  over  5  years  cannot  ensure  access  to  a  meaningful  medicare prescription drug benefit that\u2014 (A) is universal and affordable; (B)  guarantees  stable  coverage  for  medicare  beneficiaries  receiving  benefits  through the  original  fee-for-service  program  or through  enrollment  in  a  Medicare+Choice plan; and low-income  stop-loss real  and  and  real  ConBUDGET stop-loss RESOLUTION low-income  AMENDMENT.\u2014 ADJUSTMENTS.\u2014The  (C)  provides  protections. (12) Congress should not be bound to an arbitrarily  low  and  inadequate  allocation  for providing  a  medicare  prescription  drug  benefit  when  the  estimated  on-budget  surplus for  the  5-year  period  described  in  paragraph (9)  has  increased  dramatically  since  March 2000. (13)  The  Office  of  Management  and  Budget recently has revised its estimates for the onbudget  surplus  for  the  5-year  period  described  in  paragraph  (9)  and  now  estimates that  the  on-budget  surplus  will  be $360,000,000,000 for such period. (14)  The  Congressional  Budget  Office  will issue its revised budget estimates in the next few  days  and  those  estimates  are  widely  expected to reflect a significant increase in the on-budget  surplus  for  the  5-year  period  described  in  paragraph  (9)  as  compared  to  the on-budget  surplus  that  was  estimated  for such period in March 2000. (b)  2001  Section  213(b)  of  H.  Con.  Res.  290  (106th  gress) is amended to read as follows: \u2018\u2018(b)  chairman  of  the Committee  on  the  Budget  of  the  House  or Senate, as applicable\u2014 \u2018\u2018(1) shall revise committee allocations and other  appropriate  budgetary  levels  and  limits  to  accommodate  legislation  described  in section  215(a)  which  improves  access  to  prescription  drugs  for  Medicare  beneficiaries  in an  additional  amount  not  to  exceed $40,000,000,000  or  the  difference  between  the on-budget  surpluses  in  the  reports  referred to in subsection (a), whichever is less; and \u2018\u2018(2)  may,  after  the  adjustment  in  paragraph (1), make the following adjustments in an  amount  not  to  exceed  the  difference  between  the  on-budget  surpluses  in  the  reports referred  to  in  subsection  (a)  minus  the  adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (1): \u2018\u2018(A)  Reduce  the  on-budget  revenue  aggregate by that amount for such fiscal year. \u2018\u2018(B)  Adjust  the  instruction  in  section  or 104 to\u2014 \u2018\u2018(i)  increase  the  reduction  in  that amount for fiscal year 2001; \u2018\u2018(ii)  increase  the  reduction  in  revenues  by the  sum  of  the  amounts  for  the  period  of  fiscal years 2001 through 2005; and \u2018\u2018(iii)  in  the  House  only,  increase  the amount of debt reduction by that amount for fiscal year 2001. \u2018\u2018(C)  Adjust  such  other  levels  in  this  resolution, as appropriate and the Senate pay-asyou-go scorecard.\u2019\u2019.

Dr.  Jackson,  a  resident  of Prospect  Heights,  Brooklyn,  and  a  member  of the  Ministerial  staff  of  Bridge  Street  A.M.E. Church,  is  a  outstanding  citizen  and  a  pillar  of our  community. Born  in  Heathsville,  Virginia,  Dr.  Jackson  received  a B.S.  in  Zoology,  followed  by  a Master of  Arts  Degree  in  Counseling  from  Howard University.  He  began  his  career  in  education in  the  field  of  counseling,  where  he  served  for almost  four  years.  In  1969,  he  was  named Dean  of  Student  Affairs  at  Essex  County  College  in  New  Jersey,  where  he  distinguished himself  to  the  point  that  he  was  promoted  to the  position  of  Vice  President  of  Student  Affairs.  In  1983,  Dr.  Edison  was  named  Executive  Vice  President  and  Chief  Academic  Officer  at  Essex  County  College.  In  that  same year,  he  received  a  Doctorate  in  Education from Rutgers University with academic emphasis  on  philosophy,  function,  role  and  administration  of  urban  educational  institutions.  During these  many  years,  Dr.  Edison  achieved  numerous  remarkable  accomplishments  so, when  he  accepted  the  position  of  President  of Medgar  Evers  College  in  1989,  he  brought with  him  a  wealth  of  experience  and  knowledge  in administering  the affairs of educational institutions. Dr.  Jackson  currently holds memberships on a  number  of  civic,  educational  and  community organizations.  His  affiliations  with  professional and  national  organizations  run  the  gamut  from the  American  Association  of  Higher  Education, to  the  President\u2019s  Round  Table  and  the  National  Council  on  Crime  and  Delinquency.  Dr. Jackson  has  also written  extensively  on  issues of  concern  to  educators,  with  particular  concentration  on  minority  students  and  the  community,  academic  preparation  and  student  performance. Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  want  to  note  that  Dr. Jackson  is  married  to  Florence  E.  Jackson, and  is  the  proud  father  of  two  children: Eulaynea  and  Terrance.

DENNIS  J.  KUCINICH OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, July 12, 2000 Mr.  KUCINICH.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to spread  the  word.  I  spread  the  word  of  the many  thousands  of  successful  people with  disabilities  who  have  benefitted  from  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA),  and  I  ask  my colleagues  to  join  me  in  celebrating  the  tenth anniversary of  this historic  legislation. On  July  26,  1990,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  was  signed  into  law.  The  nation\u2019s handicapped  community  was  presented  with perhaps  their  most  important  legislation  in  the history  of  the  United  States.  With  the  signing of  this  bill,  handicapped  individuals  were  given the  opportunity  and  the  access  to  have  their incredible  potential  recognized.  For  ten  years now,  the  ADA  has  extended  the  American dream  to  ities. With  ter nation. Paying  tribute  to  this  momentous  event,  I commemorate  the  Disability  Coalition  Movement  of  Cleveland  in  creating  \u2018\u2018ADA  Day\u2014A Celebration\u2019\u2019.  In  sponsoring  this  event,  the communities  of  Northeast  Ohio  are  recognizing  the  previous  accomplishments  of  the ADA,  and  envisioning  the  future  success  that will  inevitably  come.  By  bringing  together  area disabled  and  non-disabled  for  a  celebration, ADA  Day  will  further  encourage  a  dialogue  of anti-discrimination.  ADA  Day  will  continue  to spread  the word  for all  to hear. Throughout  my  district  and  throughout  our nation,  handicapped  individuals  have  impacted their  neighborhoods.  A message  of  awareness and  understanding  has  been  spread,  and  this message must only get  louder. The  tenth  anniversary  of  the  Americans  with Disability  Act  is  a  time  commemorating  handicapped  people  and  applauding  events  like ADA  Day\u2014A  Celebration.  My  fellow  colleagues,  please  join  me  in  spreading  this  important word. millions  of  Americans  with  disabilthis act, America has become a betHONORING  DR.  ANTANAS  RAZMA HON.

WE  NEED  JUSTICE  IN  THE DISTRIBUTION  OF  THE  SURPLUS HON.  MAJOR  R.  OWENS OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, July 12, 2000 Mr.  OWENS.  Mr.  Speaker,  today\u2019s  New York  Times  reports  that  Democrats  are  showing  greater  interest  in  tax  cuts.  On  the  floor  of this  House  at  the  beginning  of  this  year  I  said that  a  tax  cut  was  inevitable  in  this  election year.  Those  of  us  who  represent  the  \u2018\u2018Caring Majority\u2019\u2019  must  make  certain  that  this  coming tax  cut  benefits  those  most  in  need  of  relief. We  must  start  with  a  cut  in  the  payroll  taxes. And  beyond  tax  cuts  we must  spread  the  benefits  of  our  blessed  surplus  to  those  in  greatest  need.

BILL  PASCRELL,  JR. OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, July 12, 2000 Mr.  PASCRELL. Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to call  to  your  attention  the  considerable  valor during  the  Korean  War  of  Julio  Mercado  of West  Haverstraw,  N.Y.,  Donato  SantiagoMolina  of  Paterson,  N.J.,  Guillermo  Alamo  of Newark,  N.J.,  and  Asuncion  Santiago-Cruz  of Philadelphia,  PA.  I  also  wish  to  call  to  your  attention  the  deeds  and  tragic  deaths  of  John  A. Pabon  and Ramon Gaya-Arce, who were  tragically  killed  in  action  as  members  of  the  65th Infantry  Regiment,  which  was  comprised  of soldiers  from  the  great  island  of  Puerto  Rico. Fifty  years  ago,  on  June  27,  1950,  U.S. forces  launched  a  military  effort  to  battle  communist  North  Korea.  Soon  after,  they  were joined  by  soldiers  from  Puerto  Rico,  plucked from  their  Caribbean  homeland  to  fight  on  a distant  continent. Many  were  dirt  poor  from  hill country  and  didn\u2019t  speak  a  word  of  English. Some  became  U.S.  soldiers  because  they needed a  job; others were drafted. Waging  war  on  some  of  the  world\u2019s harshest  terrain,  through  the  sweltering heat of summer  and  the  bone-chilling  winds  of  winter, the  steely  group  of  Puerto  Rican  soldiers fought  with  incredible  determination  and  courage. These  Puerto  Rican  soldiers  gave  their hearts  to  the  fight  and  helped  sweep  the North Koreans  back  to  the  38th  parallel.  Working side  by  side  with  the  U.S.  forces  from  Maine to  California,  they  then  attacked  Chinese forces  that  had  entered  the  fray  on  behalf  of the North Koreans. Through months  of  bitter  battle,  in  which  the warring  factions  worked  themselves  into  a bloody  stalemate,  the  Puerto  Rican  soldiers fought  valiantly  along  side  GIs  from  Maine  to California,  sacrificing  their  lives  for  the  ideals of democracy. Negotiators  finally  signed  an  armistice agreement  at  Panmunjom  on  July  27,  1953. The  North  Koreans  returned  to  the  northern side  of  the  38th  parallel,  while  democracy  was allowed  to  once  again  flourish  in  the  Republic of South Korea. In  later  years,  the  Korean  War  would  be called  \u2018\u2018The  Forgotten War.\u2019\u2019 But  for  the Puerto Rican  soldiers  who  gave  everything  they  had to preserve  freedom,  this war will never be  forgotten. As  we  prepare  to  commemorate  \u2018\u2018National Korean  War  Veterans  Armistice  Day\u2019\u2019  on  July 27,  let  us  thank  the  Puerto  Rican  soldiers  who demonstrated  their  love  for  America,  although they  did  not  have  a  vote\u2014and  still  don\u2019t\u2014in the affairs of  this great nation. Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  also  like  to  bring  to your  attention  the  actions  of  three  individuals who  have  worked  selflessly  to  raise  public awareness of Korean War  veterans  from Puerto Rico. Specifically, Puerto Rico Senator Kenneth  McClintock,  retired  U.S.  Army  Sgt.  Angel Cordero  of  Paterson,  N.J.,  who  serves  as  a Junior  ROTC  instructor  at  Eastside  High School  in  Paterson,  and  Ruben  Pabon,  Jr.  of Northvale,  N.J.  should  be  lauded  for  enlightening  us  of  the  Puerto  Rican  veterans\u2019  valiant efforts  on  behalf  of  our  nation.  Sadly,  Mr. Pabon  is  waiting  for  the  body  of  his  late  brothA.  Pabon,  fifty  years  to  be  after  recovered  from the  end  of  the er,  Cpl.  John  Korea  some  war. Let  us  all  pray  that  democracy  can  reach every  corner  of  the  Earth,  from  Havana,  Cuba to  Beijing,  China.  And,  just  like  our  brave  soldiers  in  the  Korean  War,  may  we  remain  ever vigilant  against  those who  threaten  our  inalienable  rights. Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask  that  you  join me,  our  colleagues,  the  people  of  New  Jersey,  Puerto Rico  and  the  United  States  in  recognizing  the outstanding  and  invaluable  service  to  our  nation  of  Julio  Mercado,  Donato  SantiagoMolina,  Guillermo  Alamo,  Asuncion  SantiagoCruz,  as  well  as  John  A.  Pabon  and  Ramon Gaya-Arce, who are no  longer with us. As  we  honor  these  men  today,  we  in  turn bear  in  mind  the  stand  of  the  many  courageous  Puerto  Rican  soldiers  against  Communism,  which  has  laid  the  foundation  for  the peace  and  freedom  that  America  and  many nations  enjoy  today. We  also  recall  the  grief  of the  Puerto  Rican  families  who  lost  their  children  in  this  war,  and  remember  the  gratitude still  expressed  by  the  people  of  South  Korea. IN  RECOGNITION  OF  THE  NEW JERSEY  DISTINGUISHED  SERVICE  MEDAL  RECIPIENTS HON.  ROBERT  MENENDEZ OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, July 12, 2000 Mr.  MENENDEZ.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today to  recognize  the  recipients  of  the  Distinguished  Service  Medal,  New  Jersey\u2019s  highest military  commendation. Through  extraordinary  courage  and  patriotism,  each  of  these  recipients  went  beyond  the call  of  duty  during  their  military  service.  Because  of  their  dedication  and  sacrifice,  America  succeeded  in  its  fight  against  naked  aggression,  defeating  the  dark  forces  of  tyranny, so  that  the  world  could  continue  its  pursuit  of democratic  ideals. It  is  not  difficult  to  comprehend  the  gratitude America  feels  for  the  sacrifices  and  contributions  these  veterans  made  to  ensure  our  freedom;  and  the  Distinguished  Service  Award  is a  wonderful  way  to  show  our  appreciation.  I personally  want  to  recognize  and  thank  the following  individuals  from  my  district  for  their distinguished  military  service:  Salvatore  F. Acerra;  Thomas  J.  Beeh;  Anthony  J.  Brescia; Joseph  E.  Callandrillo;  Walter  F.  Camporeale; Harold  E.  Cerbie;  Richard  B.  Clark;  John  P. Conlon;  Anthony  R.  Costantino;  John  O. Coughi;  John  F.

Today,  it  is  my  honor  to  recognize  there  exceptional  individuals. With  courage, honor, and integrity  they  have  each  made  invaluable  and enduring  contributions  to  America.  I  ask  that my  colleagues  join  me  in  recognizing  them  as well. LIVE  A  LITTLE HON.  BARNEY  FRANK OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, July 12, 2000 Mr.  FRANK  of  Massachusetts.  Mr.  Speaker, I  have  for  some  time  felt  that  we  have  overemphasized  the  importance  of  holding  down the  cost  of  medical  care  as  a  general  principle.  The  notion  that  if  the  total  amount  we spend  on  medical  care  in  all  of  its  facets  as a  percentage  of  the  gross  domestic  product exceeds  some  arbitrary  figure  we  will  be  damaged  economically  is  demonstrably  false.  A dozen  years  ago  or  so,  people  were  convinced  that  America\u2019s  economic  performance was  being  retarded  because  we  spent  too much  on  medical  care.  No  one  can  now  make that  argument,  given  the  strength  of  our  economy,  and  the  continued  high  percentage  that medical  care  absorbs  of  our  gross  domestic product  compared  to many other  countries. Indeed,  I  believe  this  notion  that  medical care  costs  must  be  held  down  despite  the good  that  is  accomplished  by medical  care  expenditures  has  caused  us  serious  problems  in recent  years.  The  ill-advised,  ill-named  Balanced  Budget  Act  of  1997  inflicted  serious cuts  on  the  Medicare  program  from  which health  care  providers  and  patients  are  still  suffering, and undoing  this  terrible mistake  is  long overdue. Because  I  feel  this  very  strongly,  I  was  especially  pleased  in  a  conversation  with  journalist  Jonathan Cohn  to  learn  that  he  had written  on  the  subject,  and  I  asked  him  to  send me  a  copy  of  the  article.  Having  read  it,  I  am delighted  to  share  it  with  my  colleagues.  It  is a  year  old,  but  it  is  not  old  in  any  other  sense. Mr.  Cohn\u2019s  arguments  are  cogent  and  supported  by  our  experience.  As  Mr.  Cohn  notes, \u2018\u2018among  all  of  the  things  a  nation\u2019s  wealth could  buy,  surely  the  health  of  its  citizens  is near  the  top.\u2019\u2019  I  am  very  pleased  that  Mr. Cohn  has  set  forward  the  argument  for  adequately  funding  our  medical  care  needs  in  so a  persuasive  a  fashion,  and  because  this  continues  to  be  a  matter  of  some  debate  in  the Congress,  I  submit  his  article  from  the  June  7 New  Republic  on  this  topic  to  be  reprinted here.

Roger  Gregory is a highly qualified and well  respected attorney  from  Richmond,  Virginia.  He graduated  summa  cum  laude  from  Virginia State University and  received his J.D.  from  the  University  of  Michigan. He has  an  extensive  federal  practice,  is an  accomplished  attorney,  and  was  described  by  Commonwealth Magazine  as one  of  Virginia\u2019s  \u2018\u2018Top  25  Best  and Brightest.\u2019\u2019 When he  is confirmed, Roger Gregory will  fill  the  longest-standing  vacancy in  the nation. He will bring  energy and insight  to  the  Fourth  Circuit.  In  addition,  as  an  African-American,  he  will bring  much-needed  diversity  to  the bench. The  Fourth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals does  not  look  like  America,  and  it never  has.  No  African-American  has ever  served  on  the  Fourth  Circuit.  In fact,  it  is  the  only  circuit  court  in  the nation  without  minority  representation. This  should  trouble  all  of  us.  Justice cannot be served without a diversity of views  and  experiences  expressed  in  the rooms where decisions are made. As  the  Supreme  Court  noted  when  it barred  discrimination  in  the  selection of  juries, the exclusion of minorities or women  from  the  deliberative  process removes  \u2018\u2018qualities  of  human  nature and  varieties  of  human  experience,  the range  of  which  is  unknown  or  perhaps unknowable.\u2019\u2019 The  absence  of  minority  representation on the Fourth Circuit is especially troubling,  however,  since  the  Fourth Circuit  has  the  largest  percentage  of African-Americans of any circuit in the nation.  In  our  circuit,  twenty-three percent  of  our  population  is  AfricanAmerican. Yet not one of the  judges on the  Fourth  Circuit  is  African-American.  Mr.  President,  it\u2019s  time  for  a change. In fact, it\u2019s past time. There have been several efforts in the past to integrate this circuit, but these efforts  have  been  blocked.  The  Administration  has  tried  since  1995  to  integrate  this  circuit,  but  the  \u2018\u2018blue  slips\u2019\u2019 for  these  nominees  simply  weren\u2019t  returned,  effectively  thwarting  those nominees. I  have  argued  for  years  that Virginia deserves another seat on the bench. Finally  late  last  fall, we  in Virginia were given  an  opportunity  to  fill  one  of  the vacancies.  We  seized  the  opportunity and  after  an  extensive  and  thorough search  and  vetting  process\u2014including time-consuming  ABA  screenings  and FBI  background  checks\u2014Roger  Gregory  was  nominated  by  the  Administration.  We  now  have  a  chance  to  correct this  gross  inequity  on  the  Fourth  Circuit.  Roger  Gregory  has  the  support  of both Senators from Virginia. There  is  time  to  move  this  nominee. Immediately  before  we  began  our  August  recess,  the  Judiciary  Committee held  a  hearing  and  three  judges  were voted  out  of  the  Committee  just  six days after  they were nominated. Of  the last  12  judges confirmed by  the Senate, 11 were  confirmed within  three months of nomination. In  1992,  another  presidential  election year  in  which  the  White  House  was controlled by one party and the Senate by  another,  Senate  Democrats  confirmed  66  nominees  to  the  federal bench.  Eleven  of  those  were  Circuit Court  judges,  and  six  of  the  Circuit Court judges were confirmed later than July  of  that  year.  Three  were  confirmed  in  August,  two  in  September, and one in October. And presidential candidate George W. Bush  has  called  on  the  Senate  to  approve  judicial nominees within 60 days. The  sixty  days  for  Roger  Gregory passed on August 30. It is time to grant Mr.  Gregory  the  courtesy  of  a  hearing. The  late,  renowned  Judge  Spotswood Robinson integrated the D.C. Circuit in 1966.  He,  too,  came  from  Richmond, Virginia.  It  is  time  for  another Richmonder,  Roger  Gregory,  to  break another  barrier. We  have  already  waited too long. I  urge  the  Judiciary  Committee  to move  the  nomination  of  Roger  Gregory, and grant him a hearing. I yield the floor. f RECESS The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Under the previous order, the Senate will now stand  in  recess  until  the  hour  of  2:15 p.m. Thereupon,  the  Senate,  at  12:40  p.m., recessed until 2:18 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate  reassembled  when  called  to order  by  the  Presiding  Officer  (Mr. ENZI). f TO  AUTHORIZE  EXTENSION  OF NONDISCRIMINATORY  TREATMENT  TO  THE  PEOPLE\u2019S  REPUBLIC  OF  CHINA\u2014MOTION  TO  PROCEED The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Under the previous order, the Senate will now proceed  to  the  postcloture  debate  on H.R. 4444, which the clerk will report. The  assistant  legislative  clerk  read as follows: A motion  to  proceed  to  the  bill  (H.R.  4444) to  authorize  extension  of  nondiscriminatory treatment  (normal  trade  relations  treatment)  to  the People\u2019s Republic of China, and to  establish  a  framework  for  relations  between the United States and the People\u2019s Republic of China. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Under the  previous  order,  the  Chair  recognizes  the Senator  from North Carolina. Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, with deep respect,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to yield  first  to  the  distinguished  chairman, Mr. ROTH. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  objection, it is so ordered. Without Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished  Senator  from  North Carolina for his usual courtesy. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage  my  colleagues  to  support  the  motion to proceed to H.R. 4444 and to pass this  legislation  without  amendment. Our  vote  on  normalizing  trade  relations  with  China  will  mark  the  most significant  vote  we  take  in  this  Congress. Indeed, it will be one of the most important  votes  we  will  take  during our time in the Senate. At  the outset,  I want  to be clear\u2014because  of  PNTR\u2019s  significance  and  because we  have  so  little  time  left  before the  106th  Congress  adjourns,  I  will  oppose  all  amendments  to  PNTR,  regardless of their merit. The  House  bill  takes  the  one  essential  step  that  we  must  take  to  ensure that  American  workers,  American farmers  and  American  businesses  reap the  benefits  of  China\u2019s  market  access commitments. There  is  nothing  that  we  can  add  to this  bill  that  will  improve  upon  its guarantee  that  our  exporters  benefit from  the  agreement  it  took  three Presidents  of  both  parties  13  years  to negotiate with the Chinese. I  ask  my  colleagues  to  join  me  in adopting  this  approach  because  the risks  of  going  to  conference  on  this bill,  in  this  political  season,  are  too great.  Bluntly,  a  vote  to  amend  is  a vote  to  kill  this  bill  and,  with  it,  any chance  that U.S. workers,  farmers, and businesses will benefit from China\u2019s accession to the WTO. The  significance  of  this  vote  is  due both to the economic benefits that will flow  from  opening  China\u2019s  market  to our  exports  and  the  broader  impact that normalizing our trade will have on our  relationship  with  China.  I  want  to address each of those points in turn. Let  me  clarify,  first,  what  this  debate  is about. The vote on PNTR  is not a  vote  about  whether  China  will  get into  the  World  Trade  Organization,  as some  have  said.  I  assure  you  that China  will  get  into  the  WTO  whether we  vote  to  normalize  our  trade  relations with China or not. What  this  vote  is  about,  as  I  indicated  at  the  outset,  is  whether  American  manufacturers,  farmers,  service providers,  and  workers  will  get  the benefits  of  a  deal  that  American  negotiators  under  three  Presidents  of  both parties  fought  for  13  years  to  achieve. Or, will we  simply concede  the benefits of that deal to their European and Japanese competitors  for the Chinese market? As  I  explained  just  prior  to  the  August  recess,  my  reason  for  supporting this  legislation  is  first  and  foremost because  of  the  benefits  that  normalizing  trade  with  China  will  offer  my constituents back home in Delaware. China  is  already  an  important  market  for  firms,  farmers,  and  workers  located  in  my  state.  Delaware\u2019s  exports to  China  in  many  product  categories nearly  doubled  between  1993  and  1998. Delaware\u2019s  trade  with  China  now  exceeds $70 million.

There  are  grassland  fires  happening  on BLM lands, private lands, and there are some  lessons  to  be  learned  on  taking care of those, too. It is not as dramatic to  talk  about  a  grass  fire  as  a  timber fire,  but  on  those  lands  where  there  is good  stewardship,  the  fires  will  stop. Where  there  is  bad  stewardship,  the fires will  blow  across  at  a  rate  animals cannot even run. The  catastrophic  wildfires  not  only cause damage  to  forest and other  lands but  place  the  lives  of  firefighters  at risk,  pose  threats  to  human  health, personal  property,  sustainable  ecosystems, and air and water quality. We  must  call  to  task  the  failed  policies  and  move  forward  with  better proactive  policies  that  protect  the West  and  the  United  States  from  the overriding  threat  of  catastrophic  wildfire. I  yield  the  floor  and  mainder of our time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Idaho. Mr.  CRAIG.  Madam  President,  I thank  the  Senator  from  Wyoming  for his comments. He has made a very critical  statement  as  it  relates  to  some  of the initiatives that are before us today, as  it  relates  to  roadless  initiatives, roadless  areas,  accessibility  to  these areas, and the risk of catastrophic  fire. Last  week,  I  sent  to  the  President  a letter  indicating  we  had  discovered that  the  administration,  in  their roadless  area  initiative,  was  not  using the current reports on catastrophic fire as  it  related  to  their  initiative.  We would  ask  them  to  go  back  and  review that  before  they  attempted,  by  regulation,  to  lock  up  another  10,  15,  20,  30 million acres of land. It ought to be examined  against  the  current  fuel-loading  on  that  land  and  the  risk  of  catastrophic fire. Now  I  will  yield  to  the  Senator  from New Mexico who has  just gone  through a  catastrophic  fire  in  his  State  that nearly  wiped  out  one  of  our  great  National  Laboratories.  It  certainly  wiped out  a  beautiful  area  in  the  mountains of  New  Mexico  near  Los  Alamos  where it  took  hundreds  of  homes  and  may well  end  up  costing  the  taxpayers  of this  country  over  $1  billion  to  repair bad  policy  and  bad  decisionmaking coming  together  that  created  the  Los Alamos fire. I  yield  to  Mexico. Mr.  DOMENICI.  I  thank  the  Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  Senator from New Mexico. Mr.  DOMENICI.  Madam  President,  I recall coming to the floor when we considered  the  military  construction  appropriations  bill.  My  friend,  the  Senator  from  Arizona,  Mr.  KYL,  recalls that.  The  military  construction  bill came  to  the  floor  and  we  told  the  Senate how we worked for over a month, in a bipartisan manner, to provide the administration with tools to improve fuel reduction  in  the  wildland  and  urban interface; that is, urban interface areas for communities that are at risk. colleague  from  New my  KYL I  understand  the  distinguished  Senator,  Mr.  from  Arizona,  has  some very  excellent  portrayals  of  what  happens to forests that are attended to and cleared  as  compared  with  those  we leave  unattended  and  then  have  a  fire. Unfortunately,  the  administration threatened  to  veto  the  legislation  we worked  on  because  they  found  some  of the  suggestions  too  hot  to  handle. However, my  colleagues  found  the  suggestions  very  prudent,  and  later  accepted  my  amendment  to  the  Interior appropriations  bill,  which  is  where  we finally  were  able  to  offer  it.  It  was  offered  there  as  an  emergency  measure and received huge bipartisan support. Throughout  the  United  States,  there is  an  increasing  amount  of  land  in what  natural  resource  scientists  and firefighting experts call wildland-urban interface.  This  is  very  important  because if that burns, not only do we lose forests,  but  we  lose  communities,  we lose  villages,  we  lose  watersheds  right close  to  cities which  have  a  propensity to  destroy  the  water  supply  as  the trees in the watershed burn. Many millions  of  acres\u2014according  to the  General  Accounting  Office  estimate,  39  million  acres  or  more\u2014of  national  forests  are  at  high  risk  of wildfires. Over  August\u2014it  was  not  a  luxury; normally  visiting  my  State  is  a  privilege  and  a  luxury\u2014I  had  to  go  there  to visit  fire-devastated  communities,  and in particular one, Los Alamos, but also some  smaller  ones.  One  of  the  communities  is  named  Weed,  where  a  couple hundred  people  came  with  their  concerns  because  they  are  so  frightened about  what  is  happening  to  the  forests on  which  they  live,  work,  and  from which they used to make a living. As  of  today,  there  are  over  52  fires burning  over  1,000  acres  each  across this country. The  total  number  of  acres  burned this  year  is  223  percent  of  the  10-yearto-date average. On  Labor  Day,  almost  burned\u2014on that one day. Close  to  half  a  million  acres  have burned  in  my  State  this  year;  many more  in  other  States,  including  the States  of  Utah,  Colorado,  Wyoming, Montana, and others. When  we  first  started  working  on this  measure,  the  administration  believed  there was  too much national  environmental  special  interest  group  opposition  to  my  mild  fuel-reduction amendment.  But  I  wanted  to  ensure that  we  did  not  just  throw  money  at the  problem  and  say  we  solved  the threat to our communities. We  gave  them,  in  that  amendment, $240  million  in  emergency  funding  to work  on  hazardous  fuel  reduction.  Actually,  since  that  amendment,  which will  be  in  conference  under  the  chairmanship of Senator GORTON, there have been  many  more  fires  that  have  occurred.  Much  more  evidence  has  been discerned  with  reference  to  communities  that  are  right  up  next  to  forests that  are  loaded  with  kindling  on  the 17,000  acres in is  supply  ground, ready to make a small fire into a monstrous fire. The  language  in  that  amendment provides  the  land  management  agencies  additional  authority  that  they now  lack  to do  some of  this  fuel  reduction work. We asked them, at their sole discretion,  to  do  this  work  in  a  way that would provide jobs to local people, opportunities  to  private,  nonprofit,  or cooperating  entities,  such  as  youth conservation  corps,  and  opportunities for small and micro businesses. We  asked  the  two  Secretaries  involved  to  identify  those  communities where  hazard  reduction  activities  were already  underway  or  could  be  commenced  by  the  end  of  the  calendar year.  We  further  asked  the  Secretaries to describe, by May of the coming year, the  roadblocks  to  beginning  hazardous fuel  reduction  work  in  the  remaining communities at risk. I can tell you about some of the communities  in  my  State  because  our State forester had no hesitation to find out  this  information.  He  went  out  to find  it. We have an  excellent State  forestry  department  and  an  excellent State forester. They found the Ruidoso area, an area many  people  visit,  has  a  very  serious threat in terms of heavy pine scattered throughout  the  areas  and  residue  on the  ground  of  a  very  high  kindling  nature. In  Santa  Fe,  the  water  immediate jeopardy. The  growing  East  Mountain  communities  of  Albuquerque  are  facing  significant fire hazards. The  Middle  Rio  Grande  Bosque\u2014a green area, a greenbelt along our river, the  Rio  Grande\u2014and  the  Espanola area,  increasingly  face  the  threat  of out-of-control  fire;  that  is,  federal  forests  that  are  not  cleaned  up,  forests that  have  not  been  paid  any  attention to in terms of management. Los  Alamos  was  deeply  impacted  by the Cerro Grande  fire and will have the continued  threat  in  unburned  canyons. We  have  all  seen  on  television  the terrible  pictures  of  personal  devastation  from  that  area  where  more  than 400 people were  left without residences. Some  were  in  duplexes  that  were burned  to  the  ground.  We  have  to  pay for  those  because  that  fire  was  started by  a  Park  Service  employee  who  made a  very  serious  mistake.  I  think  we  are all  aware  of  that.  That  actually  happened. I  want  to  summarize  my  remarks  by suggesting  that  it  is  still  very  interesting  to  me  how  the  Secretary  of  the Interior,  Mr.  Babbitt,  can  come  out  to the West and say some of the things he does.  President  Clinton\u2019s  Interior  Department  has  been  in  charge  of  many federal  lands\u2014along  with  Agriculture Department,  in  charge  of  the  forests for  as  long  as  Clinton  has  been  President. I say to my  friend  from the State of  Arizona,  soon  that  will  be  8  years. They  have  been  in  control  of:  How should  we  manage?  What  should  we cut? What  should we  do with  these  forests?  It  is  interesting  that  Mr  Babbitt VerDate 11-MAY-2000 00:47 Sep 06, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\G05SE6.032 pfrm02 PsN: S05PT1 ",

It  means  partnering  with  local  schools to modernize school buildings and build more  schools.  It  means  increasing  Pell Grants  so  more  young  Americans  have a  chance  to  go  to  college.  It  means more  pre-school  and  after-school  help for parents and schools. We  must  adopt  sensible  gun  controls that  keep  our  communities  and  our schools  safe.  We  should  require  child safety  locks  on  all  guns,  and  we  must close the gun show loophole. We  must  adopt  urgently  needed  immigration  reforms.  We  must  expand the  visa  quota  for  skilled workers\u2014the so-called  \u2018\u2018H\u20131B  visa.\u2019\u2019  And  we  must adopt  new  laws  to  ensure  equal  treatment  under  our  immigration  laws  for Latino and other immigrants. Last  but  not  least,  we  must  enact  a prescription  drug  benefit  as  part  of  the Medicare  program.  Whenever  a  senior citizen  signs  up  for  Medicare,  a  comprehensive  prescription  drug  benefit should  automatically  come  with  it. Senior citizens shouldn\u2019t have to battle HMOs  and  insurance  companies  to  get the  prescription  drugs  they  need.  Yet, that  is  what  our  Republican  friends propose. Let\u2019s do it right\u2014and do it now. Let\u2019s pass  a  prescription  drug  benefit  as  an integral  and  normal  part  of  the  Medicare  program,  just  like  hospitalization and doctors\u2019 visits. This  summer,  Congress  voted  tax breaks  for  the  wealthiest  Americans and  a  pay  raise  for  itself,  but  the  Republican  leadership  has  continued  to block  efforts  to  raise  the  salaries  of America\u2019s  most  underpaid  workers\u2014 those earning the minimum wage. While  Members  of  this  Republican Congress  are  quick  to  find  time  to  increase  their  own  salaries  and  cut  taxes for  the  wealthiest  Americans,  they have  not  yet  found  the  time  to  pass  an increase  in  the  minimum  wage  to  benefit  those  hard-working,  low-wage Americans.  The  Republican  leadership has  insisted  on  doing  nothing  for  those at  the  bottom  of  the  economic  ladder. It  is  an  outrage  that  Congress  would raise its own pay but not the minimum wage. I  was  pleased  to  hear  during  the  recess that House Republicans are finally coming  around  to  our way  of  thinking. Last  week,  after  three  years  of  footdragging,  Speaker  offered  the President  a  plan  to  raise  the minimum wage.  This  is  a  positive  development, and  it  gives  us  real  hope  that  we  can raise  the  pay  of  the  lowest  paid  workers this year. These  low  income  working  families deserve a raise. Their pay has been  frozen  for  three  years.  Since  January  1999 alone,  minimum  wage  workers  have now  lost  $3,000  due  to  the  inaction  of Congress.  If  we  fail  to  increase  the minimum  wage  this  year,  it  will  lose all  of  the  value  gained  by  the  last  two increases.  Minimum  wage  earners should not be forced to wait any longer for an increase. But we  can\u2019t  use  this  as  an  excuse  to cut  workers\u2019  overtime  pay,  as  Speaker HASTERT HASTERT proposes.  We  can\u2019t  raise  the minimum  wage  on  one  hand\u2014and  cut overtime pay for millions of Americans on the other hand. The  typical  American  family  is working  more  and  more  hours,  according  to  a  study  released  for  Labor  Day by  the  Economic  Policy  Institute called  \u2018\u2018The  State  of  Working  America 2000\u20132001.\u2019\u2019  Employees  have  increasingly  been  forced  to  work  mandatory overtime\u2014time  they  would  rather  be spending  with  their  families\u2014and  they should  be  fairly  compensated  for  that work. Several  new  studies  further  prove how  important  a  minimum  wage  increase  is.  A  recent  report  released  by the  Economic  Policy  Institute  entitled \u2018\u2018The  Impact  of  the  Minimum  Wage: Policy  Lifts  Wages,  Maintains  Floor for  Low-Wage  Labor  Market\u2019\u2019  reveals that  63  percent  of  gains  from  a  $1  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  would  go to  families  in  the  bottom  40  percent  of the income distribution. The study also finds  that  the  higher  wage  raises  the incomes  of  low-wage  workers,  with  no evidence  of  job  loss.  In  addition,  the study  reports  that,  among  people  who will  benefit  from  an  increase  in  the minimum  wage,  1.75  million  workers are  parents  with  earnings  below  $25,000 a year. A  June  2000 Conference Board  report, \u2018\u2018Does  A  Rising  Tide  Lift  All  Boats? America\u2019s  Full-time  Working  Poor Reap  Limited  Gains  in  the  New  Economy,\u2019\u2019  found  that  poverty  has  risen among  full-time,  year  round  workers since  1973.  Lower  skilled  workers  have profited  much  less  from  the  current economic  boom.  They  have  yet  to  recover  from  the  serious  erosion  of  their earnings from the mid-1970s to the mid1990s.  The  number  of  full-time  workers in  poverty  has  doubled  since  the  late 1970s\u2014from  about  1.5 million  to  almost 3 million  by  1998. Millions  of  poor  children  are  dependent  upon  these  fulltime workers. \u2018\u2018Minimum  Wage  Careers?\u2019\u2019,  an  August  1999  study  by  two  government economists, found that 12 percent of all workers  have  spent  the  first  ten  years of  their  careers  within  $1  of  the  minimum  wage.  8  percent  of  workers,  predominantly women, minorities, and the less-educated,  spend  at  least  50  percent of  their  first  ten  post-school  years  in jobs paying  less than $1 above the minimum  wage.  This  research  demonstrates that millions of workers stay at  or  near  the  minimum  wage  long after  their  entry  into  the  workforce. The  minimum  wage  is  not  just  an \u2018\u2018entry  level\u2019\u2019  wage.  As  the  study  concludes,  \u2018\u2018minimum wage legislation has non-negligible  effects  on  the  lifetime opportunities  of  a  significant  minority of workers.\u2019\u2019 Raising  the  minimum  wage  is  not just  a  labor  issue.  The  minimum  wage issue  is  also  a  family  issue.  Forty  percent  of  minimum  wage  workers  have families.  Parents  are  spending  less  and less  time with  their  families. Listen  to this: 22 hours less a week than they did 30  years  ago,  according  to  a  study  last year by the Council of Economic Advisers. As reflected in a report released by the  Economic  Policy  Institute  last week,  an  average  middle-class  family in  1998  spend  6.8  percent  more  time  at work  then  it  did  in  1989.  These  extra hours  at  work  mean  that  parents  have less  time  to  spend  with  their  children. Raising  the  minimum  wage  issue  is also  a  children\u2019s  issue.  Thirty-three percent  of  minimum  wage  earners  are parents  with  children  under  18.  Over  8 million  children  living  in  poverty  live in  working  poor  families.  The  Children\u2019s Defense Fund recently released a report  called  \u2018\u2018The  State  of  America\u2019s Children  2000.\u2019\u2019  A  chapter  on  Family Income  explains  that  if  \u2018\u2018recent  patterns  persist,  one  out  of  every  three children born  in  2000 will have  spent at least  a  year  in  poverty  by  his  or  her 18th  birthday.\u2019\u2019  The  inadequate  pay  of these workers  is the reason why 33 percent  of  all  poor  children,  or  4.3 million children,  in  1998  were  poor  despite  living  in  a  family  where  someone  worked full-time,  year-round.  Children  who grow  up  in  poor  families  face  a  much higher risk of poor health, high rates of learning disabilities and developmental delays,  and  poor  school  achievement and  they  are  far more  likely  to  end  up in poverty themselves. Raising  the  minimum  wage  is  also  a civil  rights  issue.  A  disproportionate share  of  minorities  will  be  affected  by an  increase  in  the  minimum  wage. While  African  Americans  represent  12 percent  of  the  total  workforce,  they represent  16  percent  of  those  who would  benefit  from  a  minimum  wage increase.  Only  11  percent  of  the  workforce  is  Hispanic,  but  19  percent  of those  who  would  directly  affected  by an  increase  in  the  minimum  wage  are Hispanic. Raising  the  minimum  wage  is  also  a women\u2019s  issue.  Sixty  percent  of  minimum  wage  earners  are  women.  The workers  affected  by  an  increase  in  the minimum  wage  are  concentrated  in  female-dominated occupations. Above all, raising the minimum wage is  a  fairness  issue.  Minimum  wage earners,  such  as  waitresses  and  teacher\u2019s  aides,  childcare  workers,  and  elder care  workers,  deserve  to  be  paid  fairly for  the work  that  they do. They  should not be forced into poverty for doing the work  that  is  so  important  to  the  citizens of the Nation. In  this  period  of  unprecedented  economic  prosperity,  the  10  million  workers  at  the  bottom  of  the  economic  ladder  who  will  benefit  from  raising  the minimum wage  should  not  be  forced  to wait  any  longer  for  the  fair  increase they deserve. Each  day  we  fail  to  raise  the  minimum wage,  families  across  the  county continue  to  fall  farther  behind.  Two facts  tell  the  story.  The  minimum wage  would  have  to  be  $7.66  an  hour today\u2014instead  of  its  current  level  of $5.15\u2014to  have  the  same  purchasing power  it  had  in  1968.

            "29": "September 5, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) S7987 REID record  in  support  of  wind,  solar,  biomass,  geothermal  and  other  renewable energy resources. Mr.  President,  54  of  our  colleagues signed  that  letter  and  they  should know  that  the  bill  before  us  today boosts  funding  for  renewable  energy by $87  million  over  last  years  levels.  This is  a  great  achievement.  And  unlike  in past  years,  I  come  to  the  Senate  floor without  the  annual  renewable  energy funding amendment but with what will hopefully  be  an  annual  effort  praising the managers of this bill. We  thank  you  Senator  for  your vision  and  commitment  to  reducing this nation\u2019s reliance on foreign oil and advancing  our  investment  in  clean,  domestic energy resources. This  increase  puts  our  country  back onto  the  path  of  a  sustainable  energy policy. In recent years, the U.S. trade deficit has  soared.  The  number  one  contributor  to  the  trade  deficit  is  imported foreign  oil\u2014and  its  contribution  has reached record levels. Since  the  oil  embargo  of  1973\u201374,  imports  of  foreign  oil  have  risen  from  a little over 30 percent to 55 percent, and will hit 65 percent in a decade. By then, most  of  the  world\u2019s  oil  will  come  from potentially  unstable  Persian  Gulf  nations. These  imports  account  for  over  $60 billion. That  is more than 36 percent of the  U.S.  trade  deficit.  These  are  U.S. dollars  being  shipped  overseas  to  the Middle  East  when  they  could  be  put  to better use here at home. In 1976, myself and a number of freshmen  Members  of  the  House  of  Representatives  proposed  such  a  provision and  nearly  passed  it  to  the  exact  same 10  percent.  Unfortunately,  that  failed. But  at  that  time  we,  a  number  of  us working  together,  did  start  the  wind energy  program,  which  is  now  blossoming, with Vermont being  the  leader in that field, and also, with a very good amendment  I  was  able  to  get  on,  we started,  really,  the  solar  voltaic  program  at  that  particular  time.  During the  period  since  that  time,  a  couple  of times  we  have  come  very  close  to  putting  into  a  mandatory  situation  where we  would  decrease  the  consumption  of oil by 10 percent through renewables. Now  we  are  on  our  way,  finally. Hopefully, this bill will pass. We  are  lowering  our  balance  ments. We are providing an invaluable insurance policy to enhance our national security. And  we  are  protecting  our  environmental and reducing air pollution. Federal  support  for  renewable energy research  and  development  has  been  a major  success  story  in  the  United States.  Costs  have  declined,  reliability has  improved,  and  a  growing  domestic industry has been born. Through  this  boost  in  the  renewables budget,  we  are  building  upon  our  successes.  We  are  helping  to  develop  industries  which  reduce  our  trade  deficit and  boost  national  security.  We  are payof  letSencomREID, DOMENICI helping  farmers,  ranchers,  rural  munities, and small businesses. The  54  Senators  who  signed  this  ter\u2014and  in  particular\u2014Senator  deserve  a  great  deal  of  credit  for  protecting  the  environment,  promoting job  growth,  and  advancing  America\u2019s future. Again,  I  thank  the  two  sponsors  of the  bill, Senators REID and DOMENICI.  I praise  them  for  their  efforts  and  helping  in  any  way  possible.  I  yield  the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Nevada. Mr.  REID.  Mr.  President,  if  I  can  respond  before  the  Senator  from Vermont leaves the floor, this has been a  very  difficult  issue  for  Senator and me for a number of years. We  acknowledge  the  leadership  of  the Senator  from  Vermont  on  this  issue. But  for  him,  we  probably  would  not  be in the position we are now. I appreciate his nice words and recognize his leadership on  this  issue over  the many years. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  Senator from New Mexico. Mr.  DOMENICI.  I  thank  the  distinguished  Senator  from  Nevada,  Mr. REID,  for  what  he  has  said,  and  I  echo the  compliments.  I  think  the  Senator from Vermont understands the delicate position we are  in  this year  in  that  the nondefense  portion  of  this  appropriations  bill  is  inadequate  to  cover  the nondefense  research and water projects we ought to be covering in the bill. I believe when we were able to almost match  the  Senator\u2019s  and  his  cosponsors\u2019  request  on  solar  and  wind,  they understand we are hopeful when we get to  conference  of  getting  some  additional  money  from  the  budget  and  the appropriators  for  the  nondefense  portion  of  this  bill  which  will  make  it easier for us to keep this and hold it all the  way  through.  I  have  been  sure  and careful  to  explain  that  to  the  Senator from Vermont. I am sure he is aware of it. I wanted to put it in the RECORD. Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I agree with him 100 percent,  and  I  am  going  to  do  all  I  can to assist him. Mr.  DOMENICI.  Mr.  President,  while Senators  are  going  to  talk  about projects,  programs,  activities,  and amendments  to  add  $5  million  here  or $7  million  there,  I  want  to  break  this appropriations  bill  into  two  parts\u2014I wish  I  had  it  on  a  chart,  and  maybe  I will  have  it  the  next  time  we  are  on this  bill\u2014so  that  when  anybody  offers an  amendment  that  costs  money,  if  it is  in  the  nondefense  part,  whatever  it is  for,  maybe  some  science  research, maybe  a  water  project  that  we  did  not fund,  maybe  operation  and  maintenance  for  some  part  of  the Mississippi, a  levy  system,  we  are  going  to  try  to show  you  where  we  are  really  hurting for  money  is  the  nondefense  part  of this  budget,  the water  projects  and  the nondefense science. As  a matter  of  fact,  the  allocation  is about  $604  million  below  the  President\u2019s request in the nondefense part of this  appropriations  bill.  That  is  $73 million  less  than  last  year\u2019s  appropriations.  It  is  not  a  question  only  of  not being  able  to  meet  the  President\u2019s  request.  We  are,  in  essence,  below  last year\u2019s  appropriated  number,  which many  people  say  isn\u2019t  realistic  unless you  are  prepared  to  take  some  programs  out  of  the  Department\u2014and  we can  hardly  do  that.  That  is  a  negative $73 million. Fortunately,  on  the  defense  side,  we have  talked  our  way  through  all  these different  hurdles  of  how  much  defense money  is  available,  and  I  am  very  appreciative  of  the  fact  that  through  the efforts  of  our  chairman  of  the  Appropriations Committee, the appropriators who  spend  defense  money\u2014that  is  the big  defense  bill,  the  smaller  bill  on military  construction  and  a  very  small bill  on  Commerce  that  spends  some money  on  defense\u2014they  have  left,  as part  of  the  increase,  sufficient  money to  cover  the  defense  in  this  bill,  which is $13.5 billion. I  regret  to  say  the  problem  we  have is when we go to the House, we have to raise  the  House\u2019s  number  because  they are  about  $600  million  below  us  on  the defense  side  of  their  bill.  It  is  a  difficult problem. I  do  believe  the  allocation  that  both chairmen  of  the  House  and  Senate  Appropriations  Committees  are  going  to ultimately  come  up  with  will  make  us whole  at  the  Senate  level  on  defense.  I just  explained  why.  The  money  is there, and I hope before this is over, we will  convince  everyone  we  are  in  an area  where  we  have  to  be  very  concerned  how much money  we  are  spending on the defense side because the morale  and  capability  of  our  National Laboratories  to  maintain  our  nuclear weapons activities is getting very close as to whether it can continue in a manner we have expected over the years. When  somebody  says  it  is  only  $7 million  and  I  need  it  for  a  levy  and  I need  to  start  a  program  even  though we said no new starts, I want to keep in front of everybody that we are $604 million below the President on nondefense, and  the  House  is  $600  million  below ours on defense, and we are $500 million higher  than  the President\u2019s  on  defense. Those will be put up here for everybody to see. If anybody wants an interpretation of what  is  in this bill,  I tried very hard  in a  nonpartisan  way  to  explain  it  in  my earlier  statement.  I  have  given  full credit  to  the  magic  of  bipartisanship when  it  comes  to  writing  a  bill  like this.  We  have  to  try  to  work  together. Maintaining  our  nuclear  capacity through  science  and  research  and  nonproliferation  should  not  be  a  partisan issue.  Thanks  to  Senator  REID,  it  is not.  There  are  a  few  disagreements  he and  I  have.  We  will  iron  them  out  on the floor. I  want  to  make  sure  everybody  understands  that  right  now,  this  day,  5 weeks  before  the  new  fiscal  year,  the nuclear  defense  laboratories,  which  essentially  are made  up  of  a  piece  of  the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 01:58 Sep 06, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A05SE6.023 pfrm02 PsN: S05PT1 ",
            "37": "September 5, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) S7995 or  bewill  be  done  if  they  do  report  it,  cause they are afraid of reprisal. For  this  reason,  Congress  amended the  False  Claims  Act  in  1986,  in  the words  of  the  Judiciary  Committee,  \u2018\u2018to encourage  any  individual  knowing  of Government  fraud  to  bring  that  information forward.\u2019\u2019 The 1986 amendments offer  large  rewards  to  whistleblowers who  bring  a  successful  false  claims  action and afford new protections against employer retaliation. While the amendments  do  not  expressly  authorize  federal  employees  to  file  whistleblower suits,  the  courts  have  generally  read the  amended  law  to  permit  them  to, since  the  courts  recognize  that  federal employees  are  often  in  the  best  position  to  uncover  and  report  government fraud. What  happened  here  seems  fairly clear. Two federal employees had information  they  believed  showed  that  oil companies were defrauding the Government. They brought  it  forward  to  their agencies.  They  also,  it  seems  likely, may have shared some of that information with POGO. They could have openly joined POGO\u2019s False Claims Act suit but,  for  whatever  reason,  they  chose not  to.  They  chose  instead  to  become, in  effect,  silent  partners  in  POGO\u2019s suit.  POGO  generously,  if  foolishly, shared its windfall with them. Probably  all  concerned  would  now agree that this arrangement was a serious  mistake.  POGO  has  handed  its  opponents  a  powerful  weapon  with  which to  wound  its  credibility  and  its  effectiveness.  It  has  not  only  brought  down a  world  of  trouble  on  itself,  Mr.  Berman,  and  Mr.  Speir,  but  it  has  deflected  attention  away  from  the  question  of  whether  the  oil  companies  defrauded  the  Government  to  the  matter before us. At  the  very  least,  the  payment  of large  sums  of  money  by  an  outside source  to  a  federal  employee  for  work related  activities  creates  an  appearance  of  impropriety.  If  the  appropriate authorities  ultimately  determine  that the  payments  to  Mr.  Berman  and  Mr. Speir were not unlawful, then Congress may  need  to  tighten  the  conflict  of  interest  laws  to  more  clearly  bar  federal employees  from  accepting  such  payments  in  the  future,  or  to  amend  the False  Claims  Act  to  prevent  federal employees  from  aiding  or  benefiting from False Claims Act suits. Crafting a legislative  solution  that would  prevent a  recurrence  of  this  problem  in  the  future would,  in my view, be a more constructive\u2014and  far  more  appropriate\u2014 use  of  the  Senate\u2019s  time  and  energy than  trying  to  build  a  case  against POGO and Messrs. Berman and Speir. Any  changes  in  the  current  laws should,  however,  be  carefully  drawn  to avoid  shutting  off  the  legitimate  flow of  allegations  and  information  about government  fraud  and  corruption  from federal employees to organizations like POGO.  These  organizations  play  a  valuable  role  in  exposing  government fraud  and  corruption.  They  offer  a  safe harbor  to  federal  employees  who  may be unable or unwilling to come forward publicly  on  their  own.  We  may  not  always  agree  with  the  causes  they espouse  or  the  allegations  they  make, but  we  would  make  a  terrible  mistake if we were to choke off the  flow of allegations  and  information  to  them  or still their voice. They must,  of  course,  operate  within the  law.  Good  intentions  do  not  give them, or the people that come to them, free  rein  to  violate  federal  conflict  of interest  laws,  agency  ethnic  rules,  or the  protective  orders  of  the  courts.  If anything  like  that  happened  in  this case,  then  POGO  and  the  two  federal employees  should  be  held  accountable by  the  appropriate  law  enforcement  officials  and  the  courts.  But,  as  the  Supreme  Court  has  admonished  us  in  the past, Congress is not a law enforcement agency  or  a  judicial  tribunal,  and  we should  not  presume  to  be  one  in  this case. The  Committee  on  Energy  and  Natural  Resources,  like  most  of  the  Senate\u2019s  standing  committees,  from  time to  time,  has  to  conduct  investigations into  certain  matters  to  do  its  job.  The Energy  Committee  has,  in  recent years,  conducted  a  number  of  sensitive investigations  into  serious  allegations of  wrongdoing  leveled  against  senior Administration  officials  whose  nominations  were  pending  before  the  committee.  Each  of  these  investigations was  handled  very  thoroughly  and  professionally on a bipartisan basis by  the committee\u2019s own lawyers. Special,  partisan  investigations  like Mr.  Thompson\u2019s  carry  with  them  special  problems.  By  focusing  exclusively on  proving  the  guilt  of  their  chosen target,  they  tend  to  lose  sight  of  the larger  picture  and  their  sense  of  proportion.  Justice  Robert  Jackson warned  us  of  this  danger  in  the  case  of prosecutors  who  \u2018\u2018pick  people\u2019\u2019  they think  they  \u2018\u2018should  get  rather  than cases that need to be prosecuted.\u2019\u2019 With  the  law  books  filled  with  a  great  assortment of crimes, [Justice Jackson said,] a prosecutor  stands  a  fair  chance  of  finding  at least a technical violation of some act on the part  of  almost  anyone.  In  such  a  case,  it  is not a question of discovering the commission of a crime and then  looking  for the man who has  committed  it,  it  is  a  question  of  picking a  man  and  then  searching  the  law  books,  or putting  investigators  to  work,  to  pin  some offense  on  him.  It  is  in  this  realm\u2014in  which the prosecutor picks  some person he dislikes or  desires  to  embarrass,  or  selects  some group  of  unpopular  persons  and  then  looks for an offense, that the great danger of abuse of  prosecuting  power  lies.  It  is  here  that  law enforcement  becomes  personal,  and  the  real crime  becomes  that  of  being  unpopular  with the  predominant  or  governing  group,  being attached  to  the  wrong  political  views,  or being  personally  obnoxious  to  or  in  the  way of the prosecutor himself. Sadly,  this case. I  fear  that  has  happened  in f COST  OF  REPORTED  BILLS  BY  THE CONGRESSIONAL  BUDGET  OFFICE Mr.  SMITH  of  New  Hampshire.

U.S. CONGRESS, CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, DEAR CHAIRMAN:  Washington, DC, August 18, 2000. Hon. ROBERT C. SMITH, Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. MR.  The  Congressional Budget Office  has  prepared  the  enclosed  cost estimate for S. 2796, the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. If  you  wish  further  details  on  this  estimate,  we  will  be  pleased  to  provide  them. The  CBO  staff  contact  is Rachel Applebaum, who can be reached at 226\u20132860. Sincerely, DAN L. CRIPPEN. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ESTIMATE OFFICE COST S.  Act  of Senate Public 2796,  Water  Resources  Development  2000,  as  ordered  reported  by  the  Committee  on  Environment  and  Works on June 28, 2000 Summary S.  2796  would  authorize  the  Secretary  of the Army, acting through the Army Corps of Engineers  (Corps),  to  undertake  projects specified  in title  I of the bill  for  inland navigation,  flood  control  and  damage  reduction, environmental restoration, and shore protection.  CBO  estimates  that  the  bill  would  authorize  about  $2  billion  (in  2000  dollars)  for these projects. Other  provisions  of  the  bill  would  authorize  the  Secretary  to  conduct  studies  on water  resources  needs  and  feasibility  studies for  specified  projects;  authorize  the  Secretary  to  convey  or  exchange  certain  properties;  renew,  end,  or  modify  previous  authorizations for certain projects; and authorize new programs or pilot projects to develop water  resources  and  protect  the  natural  environmental,  including  a  program  to  restore the  natural  environment  of  the  south  Florida  ecosystem.  For  these  activities,  CBO  estimates  that  S.  2796  would  authorize  the  appropriation of about $1.7 billion. Assuming  the  appropriation  of  the  necessary  amounts,  including  adjustments  for increases  in  anticipated  inflation,  CBO  estimates  that  implementing  S.  2796  would  cost about  $1.6  billion  over  the  2001\u20132005  period, and another  $2.5 billion over  the  following  10 years  for  the  projects  that  would  be  authorized  by  the  bill.  (Some  construction  costs and operations and maintenance would occur after  this period.) CBO estimates  that enacting  S.  2796  would  increase  certain  offsetting receipts to the Federal Government by about $3  million  over  the  2001\u20132003  period.  Because enacting  the  bill  would  affect  direct  spending, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. S.  2796  contains  no  intergovernmental  or private-sector  mandates  as  defined  in  the Unfunded  Mandates  Reform  Act  (UMRA).

THE PIPELINE INTEGRITY,  SAFETY AND RELIABILITY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2000 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today  to  address  a  serious  issue  currently  pending  in  the  Senate\u2014pipeline safety. On August 19, there was a tragic pipeline  accident  in  my  state  of  New Mexico.  A  natural  gas  transmission line  ruptured  at  5:30  a.m.  that  Saturday  morning  in  a  rural  area  south  of Carlsbad,  NM.  Unfortunately,  the  rupture  occurred  near  a  popular  fishing spot  along  the  Pecos  river.  Two  families  were  camped  below  the  bridge  traversed  by  the  pipeline.  Eleven  people, including  five  small  children,  died when  their  favorite  camping  spot  was overcome  by  heat  and  flames.  I  have just  learned  that  the  one  survivor, Amanda  Smith,  died  earlier  today.  I would  like  to  include  a  couple  of  articles  about  the  victims  to  be  printed  in the  after  my  statement.  They should  be  remembered  as  individuals, not mere statistics. This was a human tragedy I can barely describe. I spoke briefly with Martha Chapman,  mother  of  two  of  the  victims,  and  grandmother  of  two  of  the children.  She  had  just  returned  to Carlsbad  for  the  funeral  from  Lubbock where she had been keeping vigil at the bedside of her daughter-in-law. She was devastated. She  said her whole  life was gone. She begged me to do what I could RECORD VerDate 11-MAY-2000 03:17 Sep 06, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A05SE6.052 pfrm02 PsN: S05PT1 ",

(a)  FINDINGS.\u2014The  the following findings: (1)  The  closure  or  downsizing  of  a  Department of Energy facility can have serious economic  impacts  on  communities  that  have been built around and in support of the facility. (2)  To mitigate  the  devastating  impacts  of the  closure  of  Department  of  Energy  facilities  on  surrounding  communities,  section 3161  of  the  National  Defense  Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 1993  (42 U.S.C. 7274h) provides a mechanism for the provision of financial assistance to such communities for redevelopment  and  to  assist  employees  of  such facilities  in  transferring  to  other  employment. (3)  It  is  difficult  to  forecast  necessary changes  in  the  workforce  at  Department  of Energy  facilities  in  advance  of  the  preparation of the budget  for the Department of Energy  given  uncertainties  regarding  future budges,  project  schedules,  and  other  factors.

Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise today  in  tribute  to  a  great  public  servant  and  a  dear  friend,  Senator  Daniel Patrick  It  is  hard  to  believe,  but  we  know  you  are  going  to stay fighting with us all this time. Senator  has  served  our country  honorably  through  more  than 4  decades  of  public  life  and  four  distinguished  terms  as  Senator  from  New York.  I  want  to  especially  salute  Liz, our  friend,  your  soulmate,  your  champion,  your  partner,  your  friend  and fighter  for  all  the  causes  that  are  good in  New  York  and  this  country.  We know  you  are  going  to  continue  to fight with us, Liz. As  a  New  Yorker,  it  has  been  an honor  to  be  represented  by  Senator and,  as  a  Member  of  Congress,  it  has  truly  been  a  privilege  for me  to  work  with  him.  A  leading  advocate  for  New  York\u2019s  renowned  medical schools and teaching hospitals, Senator has  fought  tirelessly  to make  sure  that  New  York  receives  the Federal  health  care  dollars  that  it  deserves. As  a  member  of  the  Irish  caucus,  I have  seen  firsthand  Senator  MOYpassionate  commitment  to  establishing  peace  with  justice  for  the people  of  Northern  Ireland.  Senator has  also  worked  relentlessly to  strengthen  the  United  States-Israel relationship  and  to  bring  peace  to  that troubled region. Yet  Senator  storied  legislative  career,  numerous  political  appointments  and  62  honorary  degrees are only part of what makes him so remarkable.  Anyone  who  has  had  the pleasure  of  his  company  or  the  opportunity  to  work  and  fight  by  his  side knows that his eloquence, intellect and dignity  have  made  him  a  model  leader for all Americans and a venerable advocate for the people of New York. Indeed, Senator MOYNIHAN has been a guiding light on so many issues critical to the American landscape, perhaps nowhere  more  evident  than  his  lifelong commitment  to  ending  poverty  in  this country. With his incisive intellect, his boundless  passion,  Senator  has  worked  tirelessly  to  speak  for those  who  have  no  voice  and  to  mend the social fabric of our Nation. MOYNIHAN\u2019s  MOYNIHAN MOYNIHAN NIHAN\u2019s  MOYNIHAN I  know  I  speak  for  all  New  York  and the Nation when I say that this institution  will  lose  a  brilliant  mind  when Senator  retires  next  year, but we will  continue  to  have  your  brilliant  mind  in  fighting  with  us  on  all these critical issues that mean so much to New York and this country. I will always treasure the time I have served  with  and  have  been  represented by  my  good  friend,  Senator  We  wish  you  Godspeed to you, Liz, as well. MOYNIHAN.

Under the Speaker\u2019s announced policy of January  19,  1999,  the  gentleman  from  New York  (Mr.  Meeks)  is  recognized  during morning hour debates for 1 minute. Mr. MEEKS of New York. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  this  morning  to  join  my  fellow  colleagues  in  honoring  the  distinguished  Senator  from  New  York.  For almost  a  quarter  of  a  century,  has  represented  the interests  of  the  people  of  New  York with  a  thoughtful,  diplomatic  leadership  presence  in  the Senate. He has  defined politics of civility. His  experience  and  expertise  in  domestic  policy,  foreign  policy,  science and  the  arts  has  guided  our  country through  some  of  her  toughest  challenges.  As  a  new  Member  of  Congress seeking  guidance,  Senator  and  his  staff  were  there  for  me  whenever  I  called  on  them  on  behalf  of  the constituents  of  the  6th  Congressional District. Senator  professional story  during  four  honorable  Senate terms  serves  as  a  powerful  contrast  to the  prevailing  cynicism  about  politics and  public  service.  has been  a  larger-than-life  figure  for  New York  and  the  Senate,  being  a  true  role model  and  a  great  leader,  with  grace and  wisdom,  that  has  made  all  Americans  proud,  no  matter  what  party, race,  sex,  religion  or  creed,  no  matter whether  you  are  rich  or  you  are  poor. Indeed, Senator MOYNIHAN,  your  career has  been  about  bringing  people  together.  What  a  great  legacy,  about bringing people together and caring  for all. Open  behalf  constituents,  I thank  Senator  for  his  dedication and distinguished public service; and  I  wish  him  and  his  wife,  Liz,  all  of God\u2019s blessing. The people of New York will miss  him  greatly. So will  the Congress, and so will our country.

Mr.  first  met  Senator  Speaker,  PATRICK KELLY)  DANIEL when  I DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN MOYNIHAN,  MOYNIHAN\u2019s  it  was  early  in  his  career. As a graduate of the Fletcher School of Law  and  Diplomacy  at  Tufts  University in Medford, Massachusetts, he was, with  characteristic  concern  for  quality education,  working  with  my  husband and others to form a New York chapter of  the  Tufts  Alumni  Association.  Its purpose was  to  found  and  fund  scholarships  and  identify  bright  young  students who would  benefit  from  a  college education.  I  remember  then  thinking how  impressive he was  in his grasp and understanding  of  the  need  of  a  quality education  for  all  and  the  need  for  its early recognition. When  ran for  Senator  from  New  York,  it  was  as native  son  come  home.  A  list  of  Senator  accomplishments would  run  on  for  hours,  and  we  have heard  many  of  them  recounted  here today.  However,  the  most  important things I believe so many will remember about  him  will  be  the  fact  that  he changed  their  lives.  He  changed  so many  by  applying  intellect  and  concern for policy over politics. During  his  distinguished  career, many  people  gained  a  better  quality  of life  and  many  people  were  able  to  better  understand  the  government\u2019s  functions, thanks to his thoughtful work. Senator  it  has  been  a great  pleasure  to  work  across  the  aisle from this House to the Senate and with you. We thank you  for your hard work, and  I  thank  you  also  for  the  work  of your  excellent  staff.  Although  Washington  may  miss  you,  sir,  we  welcome you back to New York. MOYNIHAN,  f NORTON)  TRIBUTE  TO  SENATOR  DANIEL PATRICK  MOYNIHAN The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Under  a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman  from  the  District  of  Columbia (Ms.  is  recognized  for  2  minutes. Ms.  NORTON.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am pleased  that  a  non-New  Yorker  has been able to get a word in edgewise this morning.  I  come  to  the  floor  as  a fourth  generation  Washingtonian  to pay  tribute  to  a  great  New  Yorker  and a  great  American.  Actually,  I  was  a New  Yorker.  I  was  Chair  of  the  New York  City  Human  Rights  Commission and  I  was  the  executive  assistant  to Mayor  John  Lindsey.  The  Senator  introduced  me  when  I  was  nominated  to be  the  Chair  of  the  Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission. But  I  come  this  morning  because Washingtonians  would  want  me  to come  and  other  Americans  would  want me  to  come  to  thank  the  Senator  for what  he  has  done  for  the Nation\u2019s  Capital,  and,  therefore,  for  his  country. This is only one of the unique roles the Senator has managed to carve out in 25 years in the Senate. As an African American, I also thank him  for  the  prescient  role  he  played  in pointing  out  difficulties  in  the  black family,  a  position  that  has  now  been embraced  by  black  leadership  themselves.

For  example, the  amount  of  the  refinanced  loan  cannot  be  increased  except  by  the  cost necessary  for  the  refinancing.  This avoids  over-leveraging  the  home.  The interest  rate  on  the  refinanced  loan cannot  be  higher  than  the  mortgage rate  on  the  existing  loan.  And  the  bill limits  the  Secretary\u2019s  authority  to guarantee  refinanced  loans  to  the  extent provided in appropriation acts. Finally,  I  would  note  that,  with  passage  of  this  bill,  it  is  not  the  intent  in the  future  that  this  new  refinanced loan  authority  crowd  out  the  issuance of  new  loan  authority.  The  concern  is that,  if  interest  rates  were  to  fall  dramatically,  homeowners  could  rush  to utilize  this  new  refinance  authority, eating  into  loan  authority  for  new guaranteed loans. However,  this  concern  can  easily  be addressed  in  future appropriations bills through different approaches, including the  simple  act  of  providing  a  sufficient dollar amount of loan authority. In  conclusion,  I  would  again  like  to commend  the  very  fine  work  of  the gentleman  from  New  Jersey  (Mr.  ANDREWS), and I urge adoption of this bill. Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  such  time  as  he may  consume  to  the  gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. ANDREWS). Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my  friend  for  yielding  me  the  time.  I rise in strong support of the bill. Mr.  Speaker,  one  of  the  hallmarks  of this Congress will be  the bipartisan cooperation  and  achievements  of  the Committee  on  Banking  and  Financial Services. I  want  to  thank  the  gentleman  from Iowa  (Chairman LEACH), the gentleman from  Nebraska  (Mr.  the subcommittee  chairman,  the  gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr.  and  the  ranking  member,  the  tleman  from  New  York  (Mr.  They have  left  their mark  on  this Congress  in  some  significant  and  bipartisan ways; and it is a pleasure to serve with  each  of  them.  I  thank  them  for their  cooperation  and  the  cooperation of  the  staff  in  bringing  this  bill  to  the floor  in  the  spirit  in  which  the  committee  has  proceeded  throughout  this Congress. To understand the importance of this bill,  we  need  to  understand  what  it would be like to be a family with an income  of  $26,000  or  $27,000  a  year  living in a modest home in a rural area of the United  States  struggling  to  pay  the bills,  struggling  to  keep  up,  and  confronting  a  mortgage  payment  each month that reflects a mortgage of 11 or 12 percent. Many  people  in  those  circumstances would  take  advantage  of  recent changes  in  financial  conditions  and  refinance  their mortgage.  They  would  go out and get a loan and pay off their existing  mortgage,  and  they  would  replace  it  with  one  that  requires  lower monthly payments. There  are  a  lot  of  significant  reasons why  the  citizens  that  I  talk  about  cannot  do  that.  First  of  all,  they  probably BEREUTER),  LAFALCE). LAZIO), genhave  a  very  low  income,  as  I  said;  and secondly,  they  build  up  very  little  equity  in  their  home,  because  the  way they build up equity  is to either  live  in a  house  that  is  appreciating  regularly in  value  or  by  making  early  payments against  their mortgage  that  would  pay down  the  principle  more  quickly  than they would interest. Neither  of  those  happy  developments is  happening  for  many  of  the  people who  we  are  talking  about  affected  by this bill. Presently,  the  law  does  not  permit the  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture  to  issue  a  loan  guarantee  or  a direct loan in order to facilitate the refinancing  of  that  mortgage  loan.  This bill  changes  that.  It  says  that  the United  States  Department  of  Agriculture  can  step  in  and,  subject  to  its guidelines  and  to  the  other  conditions set  forth  by  the  ranking  member,  can issue a  loan guarantee or, where appropriate, a direct loan. What  does  that  mean  to  the  family that I talked about at the outset of my remarks?  Well,  it  may  mean  up  to about  $100  a  month  in  lower  mortgage payments,  $100  a  month  more  for health care or  for education or to meet the  other  demands  of  the  household. This  is  a  sensible,  bipartisan  approach to  a  problem  that  is  affecting  a  lot  of people. As  we  heard  previously,  there  are 65,000  borrowers  across  the  country who  are  paying  interest  rates  in  excess of  91\u20442 percent,  and  there  are  9,100  of those  borrowers  paying  interest  rates in excess of 13 percent. This is a modest measure  that  will  help  those  families in a significant way. I  would  like  to  express  my  appreciation  to  the  staff  on  both  the  majority and  minority  side  for  their  cooperation,  to  the  United  States  Department of  Agriculture  for  their  steadfast  support  of  this,  to  Geoff  Plague  of  my  office for his outstanding work. Let  me  again  say  to  the  gentleman from  Iowa  (Chairman  and  the gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr.  LAand  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska  (Mr.  and,  in  his  absence,  the  gentleman  from  New  York (Mr.  LAZIO),  and  also  the  gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. FRANK)  that  I appreciate their cooperation. I urge the adoption of the bill. Mr.  LEACH.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  3 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska  (Mr.  who  has  spent so much of his time in this Congress on the housing issues.

In addition, I would like to thank the gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr.  LAFALCE),  the  ranking  minority  member of  the  House  Committee  on  Banking and  Financial  Services,  and  the  gentleman  from  Massachusetts  (Mr. FRANK),  the  ranking  minority  member of the House Subcommittee on Housing and  Community  Opportunity,  for  their efforts on this measure. b 1045 ANDREWS)  Furthermore,  the  gentleman  from New  Jersey  (Mr.  deserves particular  attention,  commendation and  congratulations  for  introducing this  important  legislation.  It  is  important  to  American  homeowners  of  modest  or  average  income.  The  gentleman from  New  Jersey  has  just  given  us, very  specifically,  some  of  the  reasons why  it  is  important to the homeowners and how it affects their pocketbook. Among  other  important  provisions, this  legislation  amends  section  502(h) of the Housing Act of 1949 to allow borrowers  of  the  Rural  Housing  Service single-family  loans  to  refinance  either an  existing  section  502  direct  or  guaranteed  loan  to  a  new  section  502  guaranteed  loan,  provided  the  interest  rate is  at  least  equal  or  lower  than  the  current  interest  rate  being  refinanced  and the same house is used as security. This Member supports the  legislation because  it  facilitates  the  use  of  the RHS  section  502  single  family  loan guarantee  program.  In  fact,  this  loan program,  which  was  first  authorized with  this Member\u2019s  initiative, with  the strong  support  of  now  the  chairman  of the  Banking  Committee,  the  distinguished  gentleman  from  Iowa  (Mr. LEACH),  some  years  ago  and  with  the support of  the distinguished gentleman from  New  York  (Mr.  LAFALCE),  has been  very  effective  in  nonmetropolitan communities  by  guaranteeing  loans made  by  approved  lenders  to  low-moderate  to  moderate-income  households. The  program  provides  a  guarantee  for 30-year  fixed  rate  mortgages  for  the purchase  of  an  existing  home  or  construction  of  a  new  home.  It  has  been very  good  news  for  the  taxpayer.  Further  the  program  operates  with  a  minimum  of  red  tape.  The  examples  from my home State  of Nebraska, where  the program  was  slow  to  start,  are  illustrative  of  how  popular  and  how  important  it  is  for  low-moderate  and  moderate-income Americans.

Mr.  Speaker,  this Member  rises  in  support  of  H.R.  4673, the  Support  for  Overseas  Cooperative Development  Act.  This  Member  introduced  H.R.  4673,  along  with  the  distinguished  Member  from  North  Dakota (Mr. POMEROY), to recognize the  importance  of  and  the  strengthened  support for cooperatives as an international development tool. This  Member  would  also  like  to thank  the  distinguished  gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. GEJDENSON),  the ranking  member  of  the  Committee  on International  Relations;  the  distinguished  gentleman  from  California (Mr.  the  ranking  member  of the  Subcommittee  on Asia  and  the  Pacific; the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ENGLISH); the distinguished  gentleman  from  Ohio  (Mr. HALL);  the  distinguished  gentleman from  Ohio  (Mr.  and  the  distinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BURR), for their cosponsorship of this measure. GILLMOR);  LANTOS),  b GILMAN),  1130 Indeed,  this  measure  is  a  bipartisan effort  and  it  certainly  enjoys  bipartisan interest and support. Finally  and  very  importantly,  this Member  wants  to  thank  the  chairman of  the  Committee  on  International  Relations,  the  distinguished  gentleman from  New  York  (Mr.  for  cooperating  in  the  advancements  of  H.R. 4673  through  the  committee and  for his support. Mr.  Speaker,  this  legislation  enhances  language  currently  provided  in Section  111  of  the  Foreign  Assistance Act  which  authorizes  the  use  of  cooperatives  in  international  development programs. Specifically,  this  bill  will  give  priority  to  funding  overseas  cooperatives working  in  the  following  areas:  agriculture,  financial  systems,  rural  electric  and  telecommunications  infrastructure,  housing,  and  health.  Importantly,  H.R.  4673  does  not  provide  for additional  appropriations.  While  the administration does not  routinely  take positions  on  such  matters,  the  Agency for  International  Development  has  not raised any objections to H.R. 4673 and  I believe  it  is  quite  supportive  and  sympathetic. Mr.  Speaker,  as  we  all  know,  cooperatives  are  voluntary  organizations formed  to  share  the  mutual  economic and  self-help  interests  of  their  members. In the United States, cooperatives have  existed,  of  course,  for many years and  in  many  forms,  including  agriculturally  based  cooperatives,  electrical  cooperatives,  and  credit  unions. The  common  thread  among  all  cooperatives  is  that  they  allow  their members  who,  for  a  variety  of  reasons, might not otherwise be served by traditional  institutions,  to  mobilize  resources  available  to  them,  and  to  reap the benefits of association. Since  the  1960s,  overseas  cooperative projects  have  proven  successful  in  providing  assistance  and  compassionate assistance,  I  might  emphasize,  to  lowincome  people  in  developing  and  transitional  countries.  Today,  people  in  60 countries  are  benefiting  from  U.S.  cooperatives  working  abroad  through projects  which  can  be  completed  at very  little  cost  to  U.S.  taxpayers.  The low  costs  are  possible  because  the money used  for the projects  is spent on technical  and  managerial  expertise, not  on  extensive  bureaucracy  and  direct foreign assistance payments. Mr.  Speaker,  the  benefits  of  cooperatives  as  a  development  tool  are numerous.  This  Member  would  like  to  mention  examples  of  democratic  and  economic  results  from  the  fostering  of  cooperatives working overseas. Building economic infrastructure is a key  role  of  overseas  development  cooperatives.  Through  representatives from  the U.S.  cooperatives,  people who have  traditionally  been  underserved  in their  countries,  especially  in  rural areas  and  especially  women,  receive technical  training  never  before  available to them. Such training in accounting,  marketing,  entrepreneurialship and  strategic  planning  prepares  them to  effectively  compete  for  the  first time in their country\u2019s economy. For  example,  agricultural  cooperatives  in  El  Salvador  helped  to  rebuild the  once  war-ravaged  country  by  providing a venue for farmers to pool their scarce  resources  and  scarce  experience in  capitalism  so  that  they  can  market and  sell  the  fruits  and  vegetables  they grow. In  rural  Macedonia,  a  small  country whose  neighbors  are  immersed  in  ethnic conflict, credit unions provide their members  a  way  to  build  lines  of  credit and savings for the future. In  rural  Bangladesh  during  the  early 1990s,  cooperative  members  bought equipment  for  an  electrification project  which  now  supplies  5  million people  with  electrical  power.  Cooperatives lay the foundation then for future economic stability. Mr.  Speaker,  when  reviewing  the  impact  of  overseas  cooperatives,  one  simply cannot ignore the impact they have had  in  assisting  people  in  transitional countries  to  build  democratic  habits and  traditions.  In  supporting  cooperatives,  people  who  have  had  no  previous experience  with  democracy  create  an opportunity  to  routinely  vote  for  leadership,  to  set  goals,  to  write  policies and  to  implement  those  policies.  Cooperative  members  learn  to  expect  results  from  their  decisions  and  that their decisions can and do, in fact, have an impact on their lives. In  conclusion,  this  Member  would like  to  thank  the Overseas Cooperative Development Council, the OCDC, for its contributions  to  this  measure.  The OCDC  represents  eight  cooperative  development  organizations  which  have been  very  active  in  building  cooperatives  worldwide.

We  passed  legislation,  as the  gentleman  from  Baltimore  pointed out,  in  1993  which  said  that  we  were going  to  ensure  that  children  would  be covered  under  the  health  care  policies of  their  parents.  However,  we  did  not also  include  Federal  employees,  the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan, under  that  provision.  We  thought  we had. I  think  that  was  our  concept  but  had  not  and  this  legislation  seeks  cure that defect in the language. Now,  the  gentleman  from  Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS), the gentlewoman from Maryland  (Mrs.  and  I  are unreserved  supporters  of  Federal  employees;  but  Federal  employees,  like every  other  individual  in  our  country, need  to  meet  their  responsibilities.  I believe that I had and continue to have a  personal  responsibility  for  my  children.  It  is  not  the  responsibility  of  the gentleman  from  Maryland  (Mr. or  the  responsibility  of  the gentlewoman  from  Maryland  (Mrs. it  is  my  responsibility. They  are  my  children.  Now,  they  are all  adults  now,  but  I  view  them  as  a blessing.  I  view  it  as  a  blessing  that  I have  the  opportunity  and  the  wherewithal, very frankly, to help them. I  would  hope  every  parent  would  do that; not only would  I hope  they would do  it,  it  is  my  expectation  that  they would do it. And this legislation simply says,  as  the  gentleman  has  pointed  out in  correct  detail,  that  if  a  court  orders you  to  carry  your  child  on  your  policy and provide them with health care coverage,  critical  to  every  child  in  America,  then  the  Federal  employer,  like every other employer, will comply with the  law  in  making  sure  that  you  meet that personal responsibility. So  I  rise  in  very  strong  support  of that.  Some  will  say  it  is  an  additional burden  on  Federal  employees;  I  say  it is  not.  It  is  an  equitable  treatment  of Federal  employees  as  we  want  every other employee  in America to be treated  so  that  children  in  America  will  be better  cared  for  and  will  grow  up more secure and safe and better citizens. Although  this  bill  will  not  get  national  publicity,  it  is  a  very  important bill,  not  only  for  the  children  that  it will  immediately  affect,  but  for  the principle  that  it  adopts  of  responsibility  of  parents  for  the  welfare  and well-being of their children.

Mr.  Speaker,  I  want  to  thank  gentleman  from  Maryland  (Mr.  for  his  comments,  because  his  comments  really  go  to  the  crux  of  why  we are doing what we are doing. I think all of  us,  all  of  us  in  this  Congress  accept the  fact  that  we  have  to  do  everything in  our  power  to  make  sure  children have an opportunity to grow up so that they  can  be  the  best  that  they  can  be. HOYER) the reI  And  when  we  think  about  something like  health  care,  a  child  able  to  be taken  care  of  if  he  has  the  measles  or the  mumps  or  has  some  kind  of  problem, health problem,  just  to know  that that  custodial  parent  is  placed  in  a  position  where  he  or  she  can  take  that child  to  a  health  care  provider  and have  that  child  taken  care  of  is  so very, very important. As  the  gentleman  said,  this  bill  may not  reach  the  headlines  of  our  papers; but  I  can  tell my  colleagues  one  thing, it  will  reach  the  headlines  of  a  lot  of families, a  lot of custodial parents who merely  want  their  children  to  be healthy. Mr. Speaker,  I  urge my  colleagues  to support  this  very  important  legislation.  I  again,  thank  the  gentlewoman from Maryland  (Mrs. MORELLA).  I want to thank all of the members of our subcommittee  for  the  bipartisan  effort  in our  quest  to  uplift  the  children  of  our great Nation.

Mr.  Speaker,  this  is  a  little  bill  that goes a  long way, a  long way as we have heard  in  terms  of  helping  those  children  who  are  most  vulnerable  to  make sure  that  they  are  provided  health  insurance.  It  is  going  to  enable  the  Federal Government to enroll an employee in a self and family plan in the Federal Employees  Health  Benefits  Program when  a  State  court  orders  the  employee to provide health insurance coverage  for  a  child  of  the  employee,  but the  employee  fails  to  provide  the  coverage. I  want  to  thank  gentleman  from Maryland  (Mr.  for  sponsoring  this  bill,  for  recognizing  its  importance.

H.R.  5062  is  the  product  of  negotiations  tween  Representative  and BILL It  applies  only  to  eliminating  mandatory  deportation  of  legal  permanent  residents  who committed  offenses  that  were  not  deportable prior  to enactment of  the 1996  law. Mandatory  deportation  will  not  be  required for  persons  who  were  convicted  prior  to  September  30,  1996,  of  \u2018\u2018aggravated  felonies\u2019\u2019  that were  not  deportable  offenses  at  the  time  of the  conviction.  Such  persons  will  be  eligible  to apply  for  cancellation of  removal. People  who  have  already  been  deported under  the  retroactive  provisions  of  this  law  will be  allowed  to  apply  for  readmission  to  this country,  thus  providing  an  avenue  for  the  reunification  of  families  that  were  split  apart  by the  retroactive  impact of  the 1996  law. A  technical  provision  known  as  the  \u2018\u2018stoptime  rule\u2019\u2019  also  will  be  eliminated  for  those  offenses  committed  on  or  before  enactment  of the  1996  law.  This  provision  enables  persons to  take  advantage  of  cancellation  of  removal. This  bill  is  only  a  modest  bill\u2014merely  a  first step  toward  the  reforms  needed  to  address the  injustices  of  the  overly  harsh  1996  law. With  regard  to  retroactivity,  persons  who  are deportable  under  the  1996  law  remain  deportable.  Though  they  can  apply  for  cancellation of  removal,  they  may  be  ineligible  for  other benefits  such  as  naturalization.  Moreover,  the bill  applies  only  to  convictions\u2014rather  than  offenses\u2014that occurred prior  to  the 1996  law. More broadly,  the harshness of  the 1996  immigration  law  must  be  mitigated  in  future  bills as  seen  in  Representative  H.R.  4966  (Fix  \u201996  bill).  The  1996  law must  be changed  to  restore  judicial  review  and  discretion  to  the  Attorney  General  and  the  courts, eliminate mandatory  detention,  and  revoke  retroactive  enforcement  of  the  1996  law  on  a more  comprehensive basis. Mr.  MCCOLLUM.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today in  support  of  H.R.  5062  and  urge  my  colleagues  to  vote  for  this  important  legislation. Mr.  Speaker,  this  bill  corrects  an  injustice  in our  laws.  In  1996,  Congress  made  several modifications  to  the  nation\u2019s  immigration  law that  had  a  harsh  and  unintended  impact  on many  permanent  resident  aliens  who  live  in the  United  States.  Under  these  modifications, legal  aliens  who  had  lived  in  the  United  States for  many  years,  and  who  may  have  entered  a plea  for  a  burglary  or  simple  assault  years ago,  suddenly  were  subject  to  automatic  deportation  with  no  right  to  seek  a  waiver  from the  Attorney  General,  as  had  been  the  law. This  retroactive  feature  was  a  creation  of  the other  body  and  was  something  I  opposed  in 1996.  It  is wrong and bad  law. The House  intention under  the 1996 act was to  deport  those  immigrants  who  were  guilty  of a  dangerous  aggravated  felony.  However,  a House/Senate  Conference  significantly  expanded  the  definition  of  such  felonies  to  include  relatively minor  crimes,  and  then  applied the  law  retroactively.  As  a  consequence,  individuals  who  had  committed  comparatively minor  crimes  would  be  deported,  even  if  the crime was  committed 30 or 40  years ago. The  result,  Mr.  Speaker,  was  a  manifest  justice. I  will  cite  one  example:  Olufoake  Olaleye,  a legal  permanent  immigrant  originally  from  NiCONYERS\u2019 JOHN ingeria  and  mother  to  two  American  born  children  had  lived  in  the  United  States  for  a  number  of  years  and  had  supported  her  family without  ever  having  taken  a  nickel  of  public assistance.  She  was  hard  working,  dedicated to  her  family,  and  in  1993  she  was  charged with  shoplifting  $14.99  worth  of  baby  clothes after  she  attempted  to  return  several  items  to an Atlanta  clothing  store without a  receipt. Olufoake,  not  unreasonably,  wanted  the matter  resolved  quickly  and  so  appeared  in court  with  a  lawyer  where  she  pled  guilty,  paid a  fine,  and  was  given  a  12  month  suspended sentence. There  the matter would have  rested. Unfortunately,  under  the  1996  law,  her  crime was  considered  an  aggravated  felony,  and  because  the  \u201996  bill  included  retroactivity  provisions,  the  I.N.S.  reopened  her  case  and  ordered her deported. Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  wrong  to  retroactively  deport  a  hard  working  immigrant  for  stealing $14.99  worth  of  baby  clothes  and  to  equate shoplifting  with  murder,  rape  and  armed  robbery.  This  Congress,  with  the  best  of  intentions,  went  too  far.  H.R.  5062  will  go  a  long way  towards  correcting  this  by  eliminating retroactivity. Mr.  Speaker,  we  are  a  just  and  fair  nation and  must  strike  a  just  and  fair  balance  in  our immigration  codes.  H.R.  5062  does  just  that and  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  vote  in  favor  of this bill. Ms.  JACKSON-LEE  of  Texas.  Mr. Speaker,  I  have  no  further  requests  for time,  and  I  yield  back  the  balance  of my time. Mr.  HYDE.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  have  no further  requests  for  time,  and  I  yield back the balance of my time. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  The question  is  on  the  motion  offered  by the gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. HYDE) that  the  House  suspend  the  rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 5062.

Again,  I  want  to  thank  the  gentleman  from Texas  (Mr. SMITH)  and his staff  and  our  colleagues  at  INS  for their  cooperation  and  hard work  in  enabling us to reach this result. I urge all of  my  colleagues  to  join  in  support  of this legislation. Ms.  JACKSON-LEE  of  Texas.  Mr. Speaker,  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support this legislation to remedy this important flaw in our immigration laws. Mr.  Speaker,  I  have  no  further  requests  for  time,  and  I  yield  back  the balance of my time. Mr.  SMITH  of  Texas.  Mr.  Speaker,  I yield  myself  such  time  as  I  may  consume.  I  want  to  thank  the  gentleman from  Massachusetts  (Mr.  for his generous comments. Mr.  GEJDENSON.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  proud to  join  my  good  friend  from  Massachusetts (Mr.  and  other  members  of  the  Judiciary Committee  in  support  of H.R.  2883,  the Child  Citizenship  Act  of  2000,  as  amended. And  I  want  to  thank  all  Members  who  worked together  to  find  common  ground  so  that  this legislation  could  move  forward  in  a  way  that was  acceptable  to  the  Administration  as  well as  the House and  the Senate. Over  the  course  of  the  last  year  and  more, the  Committee  on  International  Relations  has been  working  on  implementing  legislation  for the  Hague  Convention  on  Inter-Country  Adoption, which  this House  took up and passed  last night.  This  brought  to  my  attention  once  again the  difficult,  and  what  must  sometimes  seem endless,  procedures  faced  by  U.S.  citizens  in adopting  foreign-born  children.  We  have  all had  constituents  who  have  called  our  offices, desperate  for  help  in  solving  last  minute  difficulties  that  have  arisen  in  their  search  to build  their  family.  After  all  the  exhausting  paperwork,  extensive  travel,  and  sometimes heart-wrenching  experiences  associated  with so  many  international  adoptions,  it  is  unfortunate  that  U.S.  families  must  negotiate  yet  another  paper maze  to  obtain U.S.  citizenship  for their  children.  This  additional  hurdle  is  particularly  difficult  because  upon  their  return  many parents  look  forward  to  settling  down  to  the joy  of  family  life  and  its  new  challenges;  they are  not  seeking  yet  more  forms  to  fill  out  and move  through  the  Immigration  and  Nationalization Service. It  was  for  this  reason  that  I  was  the  original co-sponsor  of  H.R.  3667,  introduced  by  my good  friend  from  Massachusetts,  Mr. which  has  now  been  combined with  the  measure  the  House  is  taking  up today. Once  these  children  arrive  in  the United States,  and  the  adoption  is  finalized,  these children  should  be  U.S.  citizens,  without  going through  a  further  naturalization  process.  And that  is what H.R. 2883 does. But  we  should  remember  that  this  is  not  just to  avoid  paperwork  or  ease mental  discomfort. H.R.  2883  will  end  the  occasional  instance  of injustice  perpetrated  by  our  immigration  system.  As  mentioned  by  colleagues,  there  are tragic  cases  where  children  of  U.S.  parents, never  naturalized  because  of  inadvertence, are  facing  deportation  because  of  a  crime  they have  committed.  While  these  children  must face  their  punishment,  to  deport  them  to  countries  with  which  they  have  no  contact,  no  ability  to  speak  the  language,  and  no  family known  to  them  is  needlessly  cruel.  We  must be  sure  that  this never happens again. DELAHUNT,  I  once  again  commend  the  sponsors  of  this legislation  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  and  hope for  its  expedited  consideration  in  the  Senate. Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Mr.  Speaker,  I am  pleased  that  my  colleagues  have passed  H.R.  2883,  the  Adopted  Orphans Citizenship  Act,  and  I  wish  to  add  my strong  support  for  this  long  overdue legislation.  H.R.  2883  would  restore fairness  to  our  immigration  law  by  removing  the  burdensome  requirement that U.S.  citizen parents apply  for naturalization  for  their  foreign-born adopted children. What our current  immigration policy says to parents is that adopted foreignborn  children  are not  equal  to  their  biological  siblings  and  are  not  worthy  of automatic  U.S.  citizenship.  Requiring foreign-born  adopted  children  to  apply for  naturalization  is  insulting  and  it\u2019s wrong.  with  the  passage  of  H.R.  2883, we  are  sending  a  clear  message  to American  parents  that,  should  they choose  to  adopt  a  child  from  another country, U.S.  citizenship will be awaiting  that  child  once  he  or  she  sets  foot on  U.S.  soil.  As  the  aunt  of  Koreanborn  Jamie  and  Natalie,  I  strongly identify with this issue. The  birthright  of  all  children  of  U.S. citizen  parents,  whether  they  are  biological  or  adopted  should  be  automatic U.S.  citizenship.  This  bill  will  simplify the  already  complicated  and  complex process  parents  undertake  when  they embark  on  an  international  adoption and I applaud its passage. Mr.  SMITH  of  Texas.  Mr.  Speaker,  I have  no  further  requests  for  time,  and I yield back the balance of my time. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.

Mr.  Speaker,  under  the  Immigration and  Nationality  Act,  a  program  exists which  authorizes  religious  denominations  throughout  the  United  States  to sponsor  nonminister  workers  in  religious  vocations  and  religious  occupations, such as lay workers, to enter the United States as permanent residents. This  program  also  authorizes  visas for  temporary  nonimmigrant  religious workers who will  serve  for a period not exceeding  5  years.  This  program  was created  by  Congress  in  1990  and  has been  extended  several  times.  The  nonminister  religious  worker  programs will expire September 30th of this year; therefore,  an  extension  of  the  existing program  is  necessary  and  must  be  accomplished with expediency. As  it  exists,  the  legislation  requires that  an  immigrant  religious  worker has  been  carrying  on  such  vocation continuously  for at  least  the  2-year period immediately preceding the time of application.  This  requirement  was thought  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of fraudulent  applications;  however,  the Department  of  Justice  and  the  INS have  raised  concerns  regarding  suspected fraud existent in the program. Because  of  a  vague  definition  of  religious  worker  and  the  inability  to  require  other  precise  definitions  of  religion,  there  has  been  suggestion  of fraudulent  applications  in  both  the temporary and permanent categories. In  opposition  to  the  views  of  the  Department  of  Justice  and  the  INS,  religious  institutions  assert  that  a  quantity  of  fraudulent  applications  has  not been  verified.  The  religious  institutions  hold  the  view  that  the  limited number  of  visas  granted  per  year  for the  nonminister  aliens, which  is  not  to exceed  5,000  persons,  does  not  demand the  addition  of  antifraud  provisions  to the existing programs.

Since the new bill  is still warm  in my  hand  as  it  comes  off  the  press,  and we  saw  it  at  noontime,  there may  be  a similarity  in  substance;  but  there  is  a heck  of  a  lot  of  difference  in  terms  of language. There are changes in this bill that  may  be  technical,  but  there  are 135  lines  of  the  new  bill  that  is  shorter than what we had in the old bill. Now,  I  know  that  some  Republican expert  decided  which  was  good  and which  was  bad,  and  the  gentleman  has a  lot  of  time  left,  and  I  know  he  will explain  why  we  do  have  at  least  in terms  of numbers  and  pages  a  different bill.  But  another  thing  bothers me  and that  is  if  we  do  have  a  very  important piece  of  legislation  and  they  both  concern  the  Committee  on  Ways  and Means,  and we  did  have  an  amendment to  the  bill  when  it  was  in  the  House that  would  allow  lower-income  people to  have  incentives  for  savings,  why would not this bill, if it had to be revisited,  why  would  it  bypass  the  Committee on Ways and Means? Why would we  have  something  that  we  have  not even had our staffs to read, since it has just been out a couple of hours? Why do we  have  this  urgency  to  get  this  thing done  with  such  speed,  in  view  of  the fact  that  our  committee  has  no  work before it? We do not get a chance to have a motion  to  recommit  on  the  suspension calendar.  We  do  not  have  a  chance  to see whether we can improve this bill. It is  not  the  identical  bill  that  we  passed here before. The  staff knows  that.  I am just  saying  that  when  one  takes  popular  ideas  and  believe  that  each  time they find us supporting something they can  call  it  bipartisan,  that  it  has  to keep  on  getting  passed,  it  is  not  right. Democrats have worked with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle on the  legislation,  and  we  still  think  that it can be improved; but since they have given  up  on  tax  cuts  and  have  moved swiftly  to  budget  gimmicks,  I  thought we  had  really  done  all  that  we  could the last time this thing came up, where we  are  now  doing  by  legislation  what President  Clinton  has  been  doing  by making  certain  the  Federal  debt  is being paid down. I  do  not  know  how  far  we  have  to  go with  this  type  of  procedures  on  the floor.  Democratic  support  was  gotten before.  Democratic  support  has  to  be gotten  now.  Since  the  parliamentarians  indicated  that  this  can be brought up  as  often  as  the  other  side  wants  on the suspension calendar, maybe we will have other bills that we have joined together  in  passing.  I  might  suggest, though,  being  in  the  minority,  one  of the  ways  that  action  might  be  gotten from  the  other  body  is  for  Republicans here to talk to Republicans there. Mr.  Speaker,  I  reserve  the  balance  my time. Mr.  SHAW.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  self such time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  say  to my  friend,  the  gentleman  from  New York  (Mr.  he  has  known  me RANGEL),  myof to  the of portion  PORTMAN), long  enough  to  know  that  I  am  a  man of  my  word;  and  I  can  assure  him  that these  bills  are  exactly  what  the  gentleman  has  already  supported  in  the committee  and  that  he  has  already supported on the floor. I  think  the  gentleman  knows  that when we get  into  the  closing days, perhaps he knows better than I do, the negotiations  that  are  going  on.  Two  bills as  important  as  these  bills  are,  to merge  them  together,  gives  us  just  another option in which to get these matters  before  the  Senate,  to  the  conference, and to the President\u2019s desk  for signature. Mr. Speaker,  I yield  4 minutes  gentleman  from  Ohio  (Mr.  the  author  of  the  pension  this bill. (Mr.  PORTMAN  asked  and  was  given permission  to  revise  and  extend  his  remarks.) Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  chairman,  the  gentleman  from Florida  (Mr.  SHAW),  very  much  for yielding me this time; and  I thank him for  bringing  this  bill,  H.R.  5203,  to  the floor today. It  is  the  Debt  Relief  and  Retirement Security  Reconciliation  Act  of  2000, and it is designed to give reconciliation protection  to  legislation  we  have  already  passed  for  the  purpose  of  negotiating  with  the  Senate  to  move  this process  forward  and  to  get  these  bills enacted this year. The  first  is  the  debt  lockbox  legislation  that  puts  90  percent  of  this  year\u2019s budget  surplus  projected  for  2001  into debt relief, and then second of course is the  bipartisan  retirement  security  legislation  that  we  have  passed  in  this House  by  a  vote  of  401  to  25,  which  expands  and  strengthens  IRAs,  401(k)s and other pensions. I  would  like  to  focus,  if  I  could,  this afternoon  on  the  retirement  security package that is before us. This is bipartisan  legislation  that  my  friend  and colleague,  the  gentleman  from  Maryland  (Mr.  and  I  have  worked on  over  the  last  3  years.  It  is  very  important.  It  is  very  important  we  get  it enacted and do so this year. We need to do all we can because there is a real retirement  security  crunch  out  there. Seventy  million  Americans,  about  half the workforce,  do not have  any kind  of a  pension  at  all  today,  not  even  a 401(k),  nothing.  The  problem  is  even worse  among  small  businesses.  We  are told  that  less  than  20  percent  of  small businesses,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  is  with businesses  of  25  or  fewer  employees, offer  any  kind  of  pension  coverage today. Now,  this  is  at  a  time  when  private savings  in  this  country  is  dangerously low.  In  fact,  last  month  we  are  told that  our  savings  rate  in  this  country was  actually  negative.  This,  of  course, hurts  our  economy.  It  presents  a  real danger  to  our  economy  moving  forward,  but  it  also  hurts  people;  it  hurts individuals.  Experts  tell  us  that  older baby-boomers,  for  instance,  have  put only  40  percent  aside  of  what  they  will CARDIN),  need  for  a  financially  secure  retirement. So  it  is  time  to  take  action,  and it is time to do it now. Part of the problem we have had over the  years  is  right  here  in  Congress. Over  the  last  20  years,  Congress  has made  pensions  less  generous  by  lowering the contribution of benefit levels, believe  it  or  not,  and  while  making pension  benefits  lower  they  have  also made  pensions  more  costly  to  offer  by increasing the number of rules and regulations on employers. Let me  say what kind  of  impact  that has  had.  Let  me  give  a  specific  example. From 1982 to 1994, the limits on defined  benefit  plans  were  repeatedly  reduced by Congress and new restrictions were  added,  primarily  for  the  purpose of  generating  Federal  revenue,  by  the way.  This  was  not  a  policy  decision that  had  to  do with  pensions.  It  had  to do  with  at  that  time  addressing  the deficit.  As  these  cutback  from  1982  to 1994  took  effect,  the  number  of  traditional  defined  benefit  plans  insured  by PBGC dropped from 114,000 plans in 1987 to  45,000  plans  in  1997.  These  are  the facts. They speak for themselves. During  the  past  2  decades,  overall pension  coverage  has  remained  stagnant,  even  when  the  defined  contribution  side  is  included.  Obviously,  it  is past  time  for Congress  to  reverse  these trends,  and  the  bill  before  us  today does  just  that.  It  is  a  comprehensive approach.  It  has  been  developed  over the  last  3  years  with  careful  consultation  with  small  businesses,  labor  organizations  like  the  building  trades  department  of  the  AFL\u2013CIO.  It  has  also been worked  on  by  pension  law  experts in the private sector, academia and the administration.  Most  importantly,  we have  looked  to  and  taken  the  advice  of workers  themselves,  folks  who  are  in pension plans, to see how they could be improved. They have  been  fully  vetted. About  200  Members  of  this  House,  almost  equally  divided  between  Republicans  and  Democrats,  have  cosponsored  the  bill  and more  than  85  outside groups  have  endorsed  it.  The  approach is  fiscally  responsible,  and  it  is  very straightforward. It  falls  in  basically  three  categories. First, we allow all workers  to  set aside more money  for  their  retirement. That means  setting  aside  more  money  in  a 401(k)-type  plan,  in  a  union,  multiemployer-type plan, a defined benefit plan and  all  other  pensions.  It  also  means setting more money aside in an IRA. In most  cases,  very  importantly,  all  we are  doing  is  trying  to  restore  those limits  to  where  they  were  before  the Congress reduced them. For  example,  moving  the  IRA  contribution  levels  from  $2,000  to  $5,000  is about  where  it  would  have  been  had  it been  indexed  to  inflation  in  the  1970s. We  also  allow  special  catch-up  contributions that help workers over 50 set aside even more for retirement. These  accelerated  contributions  will  allow older  workers\u2014especially  women  returning  to the  workforce\u2014the  opportunity  to  build  up  a retirement  nest  egg  more  quickly\u2014at  a  time  in VerDate 11-MAY-2000 03:41 Sep 20, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\K19SE7.116 pfrm06 PsN: H19PT1 ",

He  has  embarked  on a  reorganization  designed  to  streamline  operations  and  remove redundancies  and  he  has  determined  to meet personnel crises head on. As  Mr.  Walker  seeks  to  make  constructive  changes,  continue  improvements  in  GAO,  he  faces  a  personnel quandary  that  has  been  many  years  in the  making,  a  series  of  budget  cuts  in the  last  decade  forced  GAO  to  undergo a  severe  downsizing  and  a  hiring  freeze which  resulted  in  a  39  percent  staff  reduction  and  significant  imbalances among the staff remaining. The  impact  of  these  cuts  and  freezes continues  to  hamper  the  agency.  GAO also  faces  one  of  the  government\u2019s most  significant  problems  of  the  next few  years.  The  anticipated  retirement of many mid-level  and  senior-level  employees who have been with the government for decades and who represent the greatest  source  of knowledge  and  experience in the Federal sector. For  example,  nearly  55  percent  of GAO\u2019s  senior  executive  service  are  eligible  to  retire  in  the  next  4  years  and 34  percent  of  the  agency\u2019s  total  workforce  will  be  eligible  to  leave  government. This  potential  mass  exodus  has  the ability  to  undermine  GAO\u2019s  effectiveness  to  an  unprecedented  loss  of  institutional  memory  that  could  directly impact  its  products  and  services  to Congress.  These  executives  and  personnel  have  provided  such  long  service to  the  government  and  have  a  storehouse  of  knowledge  and  experience that  cannot  be  duplicated  or  easily  replaced. In  the  case  of  GAO,  because  of  the wide variety of  issues they handle, this is  a  loss  of  expertise  across  many, many  areas  of  government.  The  expected  loss  of  so many  seasoned  executives  and  supervisors,  combined  with the  massive  downsizing  experienced during  the  past  decades,  when  taken together,  is  at  the  core  of  GAO\u2019s  current and future personnel problems. Indeed, it is this one-two punch of recent and expected personnel departures that  Mr.  Walker  and  the  GAO  are  now trying  to  confront,  in  part  through  the legislation now before us. In  his  efforts  to  more  effectively focus  GAO  on  the  needs  of  Congress  in the  21st  century,  the  Comptroller  General  has  also  recognized  that  the  skills GAO employees have today may not always  be  suited  for  the  agency\u2019s  needs in  the  future.  GAO  has  undertaken  a number  of  initiatives  from  the  new strategic  plan  to  a  skills  and  knowledge database of its employees. These  efforts  will  help  the  agency  to ascertain both the current skill set and future  skills  gap  of  its work  force.  The legislation  will  also  help  to  remedy this problem by providing  flexibility  in filling the gaps. Mr.  Speaker,  as  I  think  my  comments  have  proved,  GAO  urgently needs  this  important  legislation  to help  it  face  the  future  and  by  doing  so help  us  here  in  the  Congress.  This  bill will  allow  GAO  to  overcome  its  pressing  personnel  problems  by  providing the  Comptroller  General  with  the  ability  to  correct  workforce  skill  imbalances  to  successfully  handle  current and future issues, and to help achieve a more  balanced,  productive  and  focused workforce. H.R.  4642  provides  the  agency  with  a set  of  tools  so  that  it  can  better  fulfill its  mission  to  support  Congress.  The bill will help GAO build a workforce for the  future  to  implement  its  strategic plan and be positioned to serve the varied important needs of the Congress. The  bill  has  three  main  provisions, which  I will address very briefly. First, the  legislation  will  allow  the  Comptroller  General  to  hire  scientific  and technical  experts  who  will  have  the same  pay  and  benefits  as  the  SES  and reclassify  senior  executives  without loss  of  pay.  This  creates  a  new  career path  for  selected  technical  positions and helps  to  redress  the  loss of  institutional  memory  so  critical  to  the  agency\u2019s work. Second,  the Comptroller General will be  able  to  offer  voluntary  early  retirement and cash buyouts to employees in jobs  deemed  surplus.  This  tool  which the  Comptroller  General  would  use  judiciously  can  help  to  realign  the  agency  in ways  to  improve  its  focus  in critical areas. The  final  provision  addresses  the Comptroller  General\u2019s  ability  to  run  a reduction  in  force or a RIF. The Comptroller General already has  the authority  to  conduct  a  RIF;  but  under  existing  rules, a RIF would be based  largely on  a  person\u2019s  length  of  service  but  also would  rely  upon  tenure  and  military preference. Under  this  legislation,  a  RIF  would be  based  on  a  person\u2019s  skills,  performance,  and  knowledge,  as  well  as  length of  service  and  tenure,  while  retaining the  statutory  preference  for  military veterans, which I strongly support. This  is an  important  change because, absent  this  provision,  efforts  to  reSCARBOROUGH)  WAXMAN)  shape  the  agency  to  better  serve  Congress  in  the  future  could  be  hampered by  continued  loss  of  employees  critical to  implementing  strategic plans, goals, and objectives. This  legislation  gives  GAO  the  flexibility it needs to maximize its performance  and  focus  on  the  future.  It  helps rebalance the agency\u2019s personnel structure  after  years  of  budget  and  personnel  cuts,  and  it  continues  efforts  to sustain  an  environment  in  which  performance in government matters. I  have  been  pleased  to  sponsor  this legislation  with  my  good  friend,  the gentleman  from  Florida  (Chairman of  the  Subcommittee  on Civil  Service;  and  we  have  been  supported  by  the  gentleman  from  California  (Mr.  in  the  legislation that has been discussed in several hearings  in  which  the  Comptroller  General outlined  the  importance  of  the  bill  and the  reasons  why  it  was  necessary  to take this action. Mr.  Speaker,  as  a  result  of  this  bill\u2019s progress  in Congress,  there  is  considerable  Member  support  and  recognition of  the  need  for  this  important  legislation.  The  legislation  is  also  supported by Mr. Walker\u2019s two predecessors in office,  Comptrollers  General,  Elmer Staats  and  Charles  Browser,  who  together  represent  30  years  of  GAO  leadership supported it. I  would  further  note  that  the  administration  does  not  oppose  this  bill  as  it only  affects  the  agency  of  the  legislative  branch.  It  is  important  to  highlight  that  the  provisions  of  this  bill will  not  have  an  impact  on  executive branch agencies or their employees. I  know  that  several  of my  colleagues initially  objected  to  this  bill  because they  believed  it  might  have  an  impact on  some  of  their  constituents.  Let  me reiterate  that  this  legislation will only affect  the  GAO  and  does  not  have  any application  to  the  executive  branch  of the Federal Government. Furthermore,  I  hope  that  my  colleagues  recognize  that  the  legislation before  them  now  includes  several changes  from  the  original  bill  which are  designed  to  ensure  that  the  provisions,  if  they  are  implemented,  are done  so  in an equitable and  responsible manner. This  includes  a  requirement  that GAO must  issue  regulations  on RIF  selection criteria after a public comment period.  GAO  must  also  report  back  to the  Congress  on  how  it  implemented the law. I  believe  these  and  other  safeguards will help  to  satisfy any concerns of  the local delegation. In  summary,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  urge  my colleagues  to  support  this  bill  so  that GAO  can  achieve  its  goal  of  being  a model  Federal  agency  of  sustaining  a strong  and  effective  workforce  and  of meeting  its mission  to Congress  and  to the American people.

Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise today  in  strong  support  of  this  bill  because  it  is  another  step  toward  just plain  old  common  sense  in  our  Federal Government. Thirty-eight States, as has been mentioned,  including  my  own  State  of North  Carolina,  have  successfully  implemented  this  copayment  program  to help  cover  the  cost  of  prisoners  health care. And there is good reason for that. In  North  Carolina,  the  average  total cost  per  inmate  per  day  is  $63.  Of  that, food  costs  about  $5,  but  health  care costs over $8.50. With  those  numbers  in  mind,  3  years ago  my  State  decided  to  implement  a $3  copayment  for  medical  services. This  bill  would  bring  that  same  common  sense  idea  to  our  Federal  prisons. If private citizens must pay every  time they  go  to  a  doctor,  then  certainly those  who  have  broken  the  law  should have  to  pay  when  they  choose  to  go  to a doctor. Yes,  this  bill  will  save  Federal  taxpayers  money.  CBO  says  about  $5  million  a  year.  However,  it  is  the  crime victims  who  will  reap  the most  benefit from  H.R.  1349.  Seventy-five  percent  of the  copayments  will  be  directed  to  the Federal  crime  victims  fund.  And  these copayments  mean  that  with  each  elective  visit  to  the  infirmary,  prisoners will  take  another  small  step  to  paying for their crimes. It  cannot  be  stated  enough  that under no circumstances will emergency services,  prenatal  care,  treatment  for infectious  diseases,  mental  health  care or  substance  abuse  treatment  be  prevented  under  this  bill.  That  will  not happen.  All  of  those  services  will  be provided  regardless  of  the  prisoner\u2019s ability  to  pay.  But  by  requiring  nominal  copayments  of  our  prisoners  for elective  medical  treatments,  this  Congress will  enact  another  common  sense reform  and,  at  the  same  time,  give some  help  to  the  victims  of  these criminals. Mr. SCOTT. Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may consume just to point  out  that  the  crime  victims  who may  get  money,  if  we  look  at  the  cost in  administering  this  program,  a  $1 copay  would  cost  33  cents  just  to  mail the $1 to the victim. Before we have accounted for it in collecting, in accounting,  and  all  that  kind  of  stuff,  the  idea that  the  crime  victims  may  get  a  benefit,  it would be a  lot easier and cheaper  just  to  appropriate  more  money  directly  to  crime  victims,  to  the  crime victims fund. This  is  a  total  waste  of  the  taxpayers\u2019  money.  Anybody  that  knows anything  about  accounting  knows  that trying  to  account  for  these  $1  copays will  be  much  more  than  any  benefit that could be derived. Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  in  conclusion,  I would  say  the  bill  violates  the  government\u2019s  obligation  under  the  Constitution  to  provide  health  services.  It  constitutes  bad  public  policy  by  discouraging  the  truly  sick  from  seeking health  care;  it  hits  those  who  are  sick ask  rethe MCCOLLUM),  from  accessing  appropriate  services,  as well  as  those  that  are  not;  and  I  think it is unconscionable to suggest we want to discourage people from accessing appropriate health care. In the end, this program will cost the taxpayers  money,  more  money  than they  can  ever  collect  from  this  program.  Accordingly,  I  urge  my  colleagues to vote \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 on this bill. Mr.  Speaker,  I  have  no  further  quests  for  time,  and  I  yield  back  balance of my time. Mr. PEASE. Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself  such  time  as  I  may  consume,  and rather  than  reiterate  the  statement  of the  gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr. which  has  now  been  entered  in  the  record,  let  me  just  mention  one  point  that  was  made  during the  debate,  and  that  is  the  assertion that Members of Congress do not copay for their health care. While  there  are  a  variety  of  options available,  and  I  am  not  familiar  with all of  the plans,  I know  that  this Member,  and  others  that  I  have  spoken  to sitting  right  here,  do  copay  on  our health care plans. Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  of the House on the bill. Mr.  Speaker,  I  have  quests  for  time,  and  I  balance of my time. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.

As written,  the  instruction would say that that was a prohibition, even if the  parents  consented.  Is  that  the  gentleman\u2019s  intent  that  even  if  the  parents  consented  this  would  not  be  allowed? Mr.  COBURN.  gentleman yield? Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.  I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma. Mr.  COBURN.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would not  have  any  problem;  that  is  their  individual choice. I have a problem in destroying  the  life  of  an  unborn  baby; that  is a different topic. But  if,  in  fact, a parent is involved, but under the auspices  of  the  HCSC  planning  guidelines and under the auspices of title 10, there is  no  obligation  to  inform  the  parents whatsoever. Mr.  FRANK  of  Massachusetts.  Reclaiming  my  time,  Mr.  Speaker,  I thank  the  gentleman  for  that,  but  the point  is,  as  I  read  the  instruction,  if that  is  an  accurate  repeat  of  the  language  in  the  Senate  bill,  it  does  not allow  for  an  exception  where  the  parents  want  to.  So  it  goes  from  saying the  parents  are  not  involved  at  all  on both sides. I would say one other thing, and I see the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  PORis  coming,  and  I  am  prepared  to yield the time to him, but I am struck, when  we  discuss  the  question  of  abortion and those who make it illegal talk about  an  unborn  child,  I  think  we ought  to  be  clear  when  we  are  talking now about a morning after bill, because we  are  often  told  there  is  a  heartbeat, there  are  feet,  there  are  various  representations of that unborn child. We  are  clearly  here  talking  about  a situation  where  there  is  no  physical manifestation  of  the  unborn  child  of the  sort  we  have  seen,  there  are  no feet,  there  is  no  heartbeat.  This  is  a philosophical  objection.  This  is  an  effort to make illegal something which is philosophically  expressed  opposition  to a  form  of  birth  control.  It  is  very  different  than  the  kinds  of  representations we get. Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask  unanimous  consent to yield the remainder of the time that  was  allocated  to  me  to  the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin,  the  ranking member  of  the  Committee  on  Appropriations, for purposes of control. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.

Mr.  OBEY.  Mr.  Speaker,  could  I  quire, how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman  from  Wisconsin  has  28  minutes remaining. Mr. OBEY. Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  14  minutes  of  my time  be  allocated  to  the  distinguished I  my(Mr.  yield  PORTER) gentleman  from  Illinois  for purposes of control. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore. Without objection,  the  gentleman  from  Illinois (Mr. PORTER) will control 14 minutes of the  28  minutes  allotted  to  the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY). There was no objection. Mr.  OBEY.  Mr.  Speaker,  self 3 minutes. Mr.  Speaker,  I  frankly  am  of  a  split mind on this issue. I am fairly old fashioned,  and  I  come  from  a  part  of  the country  where  these  kinds  of  subjects are not discussed much  in public, and  I frankly  get  uneasy  when  I  walk  into  a lot of places and see condoms and other devices  being  made  available  on  a wholesale  basis.  I  am  very  uncomfortable  about  that.  But  I  think  it  is  also a complicated question. I  have  concerns  about  the  motion  of the  gentleman  from  Oklahoma  and  actually  there  are  a  number  of  reasons. First  of  all,  because  I  am  not  necessarily  convinced  that  the  best  approach  in  my  city,  my  hometown would  be  the  best  approach  in  New York  or  San  Francisco  or  Lexington, Kentucky or other communities or vice versa.  And  I  think  one  of  the  problems with  the  Coburn motion  is  that  it  gets in the way of local people being able to decide  how  they  want  to  handle  a  very sensitive problem. Secondly,  I  think  you  do  have  conflicting views about which approach actually  saves  the  most  lives  and  prevents  the  most  abortions.  And  I  suspect  that  what  the  answer  is  to  that question  again  depends  on  the  community  morals  and  practices  and  culture. And  so  while  I  understand  those  who say  that  they  find  issues  like  this  distasteful  and  sometimes  they  get,  in fact, angry. Mr. Speaker, I really wonder whether it  is  wise  for  the  Congress  to  tell  local school  districts  that  one  approach  is better than another. The other thing I would simply say is that we  are  trying  to  close  up  this  session,  and  that  means  we  are  trying  to resolve  differences;  that  means  we  are trying  to  keep  as  much  language  off appropriation  bills  as  possible,  and  it seems  to  me  that  to  the  extent  that these  riders  are  attached,  which  are legislative  in  nature,  they  get  in  the way  of  our  ability  to  finish  our  work before  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  and that causes all kinds of turmoil. And  also,  frankly,  if  we  are  going  to start  making  motions  to  instruct  on this bill, then a number of us are going to  have  motions  to  instruct  to  try  to accomplish  policy  ends  that  we  think are  important  also.  So  if  we  are  about to  get  into  that  business,  then  I  guess we  are  going  to  have  to  get  into  it  all the way. Mr.  Speaker,  my time. Mr.  COBURN.  Mr.  myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, I just say in response to the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin  (Mr. OBEY), there are 4,000 clinics, outside of Speaker,  balance  reserve  yield the  I  of I  of the  reserve  balance  SPECTER,  school  clinics,  where  you  can  get  this done  with  Federal  funds,  what  we  are saying  is,  is  this  should  not  be  happening  in  a  middle  school.  There  is plenty  of  places  that  if  you  want  this service,  you  can  get  it,  but  it  should not  be  occurring  in  the  seventh  and eighth grades in this country without a parent involved. Mr.  Speaker,  I  my time. Mr.  PORTER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  the  motion  of  the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COBURN) is certainly  a  proper  motion  and  appropriate, but it is a very unfortunate motion for us. It  contravenes  instructions  given  to us  by  our  own  leadership,  it  attempts to circumvent the House rules and procedures,  and  it  makes  the  completion of  our  conference  more  difficult  at  a time  when  we  are  trying  to  finish  our work.  In  meetings  in  mid-July,  I should  tell  the  gentleman  from  Oklahoma,  the  bicameral  majority  party leadership  decided  that  we  should  drop all  controversial  riders  to  the  Labor, HHS  and  Education  bill.  The  senior senator  from  Pennsylvania,  the  chairman  of  the  Senate  subcommittee,  Mr. and  I  were  instructed  to  do that  to  move  this  process  forexactly  ward. Mr.  Speaker,  based  on  these  instructions, the Senate receded from its position  on  this  amendment;  and  all  other similar  riders were  dropped  in  the  conference. Mr. Speaker, the motion  if offered by the  gentleman  from  Oklahoma  as  an amendment  to  the  bill  would  not  be  in order  in  the House.  Thus  the  import  of this  action  is  to  attempt  to  do  by  motion  what  the  rules  would  have  prevented  him  from  doing  by  amendment on the House floor. Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  this  motion will  only  serve  to  sharpen  differences within  this  bill  and  delay  the  completion of the final conference report. Mr. Speaker, of the funds made available  in  the  bill,  Elementary  and  Secondary Education Act funds are prohibited, by law, from being used for health clinics  of  any  sort.  Only  Public  Health Service  funds  provide  a  substantial source  for  the  activities  that  the  gentleman is alluding to. I  note  that  the  gentleman  is  a  member,  and  a  valued member,  of  the  Committee  on  Commerce;  he  is,  in  fact, vice  chair  of  the  Subcommittee  on Health.  I  also  note  that  recently  coming  across  my  desk  he  wrote  with  others  a  dear  colleague  relating  to  the Ryan White AIDS program. Now,  we  support  very  strongly  the Ryan  White  AIDS  program;  and  we,  in fact,  have  very  substantially  increased it  over  the  President\u2019s  budget  request. I  certainly  applaud  the  bipartisanship on  that  matter.  While  amending  the Public  Health  Services  Act  to  reauthorize Ryan White, why  could  not  the provisions  included  in  the  motion  be included  there?  Why  did  not  the  gentleman  simply  add  the  provisions  that VerDate 11-MAY-2000 04:27 Sep 20, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00094 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K19SE7.179 pfrm06 PsN: H19PT1 ",

Mr. WOLF. Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today after reading today\u2019s editorial from the Washington  Post  titled  \u2018\u2018Catholic \u2018Criminals\u2019  in  China,\u2019\u2019  that  describes how  the  Chinese  Government  has  rearrested an 81-year-old Roman Catholic bishop,  Bishop  Zeng.  Here  is  a  picture of  Bishop  Zeng  in  prison  garb.  And  the Senate  today  is  ready  to grant MFN  to China. The  bishop  has  spent most  of  his  life in  a  Chinese  prison,  imprisoned through  labor  camps.  He  was  imprisoned  in  1958,  was  let  out  of  jail  for  1 month,  then  rearrested  and  imprisoned until  1991.  In  1996,  in  his  late  70s,  he was  rearrested  again  and  put  in  a forced  labor  camp.  Imagine  being  in  a forced  labor  camp  at  70  and  80  years  of age. A  Chinese  leader  affiliated  with  the Chinese Government\u2019s recent public relations  blitz  said,  \u2018\u2018American  voters should  get  to  know  us.\u2019\u2019  Indeed,  American  people,  this  Congress,  the  Clinton administration  and  the  next  administration  must  know  the  true  character of  the  Chinese  Government  is  one  that throws  80-year-old  Catholic  bishops into forced labor camps. Does  anyone  in  the  Clinton  administration  care?  Does  the  Congress  care? Does anyone care? [From the Washington Post, Sept. 9, 2000] CATHOLIC \u2018CRIMINALS\u2019 IN CHINA The  Communist  regime  in  China  has  identified  and  rooted  out  another  enemy  of  the state:  81-year-old  Catholic  Bishop  Zeng Jingmu.  The  Cardinal  Kung  Foundation,  a U.S.-based  advocate  for  the  Roman  Catholic Church and its estimated 10 million followers in  China,  reports  that  Bishop  Zeng  was nabbed  last  Thursday.  An  embassy  spokesman  here  said  he  couldn\u2019t  comment.  This wouldn\u2019t  be  a  first  for  this  apparently  dangerous  cleric.  He  was  imprisoned  for  a  quarter-century  beginning  in  1958.  In  1983,  the Communists  let  him  out\u2014for  one  month. Then they jailed him for another eight years, until  1991.  In  1996\u2014at  the  age  of  76\u2014he  was sentenced  to  three  years  of  forced  labor  and reeducation.  When  he  was  released  with  six months still to run on that sentence,  in 1998, the  Clinton  administration  trumpeted  the news  as  \u2018\u2018further  evidence  that  the  president\u2019s policy of engagement works.\u2019\u2019 The fatuousness  of  that  statement  must  be  especially  clear  to  the  bishop  from  his  current jail cell. Bishop  Zeng  has  been  guilty  of  a  single crime all along: He  is a Catholic believer. He refuses  to  submit  to  Communist  atheism  or to the control of the Catholic Patriotic Association,  an  alternative  \u2018\u2018church\u2019\u2019  created  by the  regime  that  does  not  recognize  the  primacy  of  the  pope.  China\u2019s  government  is willing  to  tolerate  some  religious  expression as  long  as  it  is  dictated  by  the  government. Anyone  who  will  not  submit\u2014whether  spiritual  movements  such  as  Falun  Gong,  evangelical  Protestant  churches,  Tibetan  monasteries  or  the  real  Catholic  Church\u2014is  subject to \u2018\u2018repression and abuse,\u2019\u2019 the State Department  said  in  its  recent  report  on  international  religious  freedom.  The  admirably straightforward report noted that respect for religious  freedom  \u2018\u2018deteriorated  markedly\u2019\u2019 in  China  during  the  past  year.  \u2018\u2018Some  places of worship were destroyed,\u2019\u2019 it said. \u2018\u2018Leaders of  unauthorized  groups  are  often  the  targets of harassment,  interrogations, detention and physical abuse.\u2019\u2019 Bishop  Zeng  is  a  man  of  uncommon  courage,  but  his  fate  in  China  is  sadly  common. Three days before his arrest, Father Ye Gong Feng,  82,  was  arrested  and  \u2018\u2018tortured  to  unconsciousness,\u2019\u2019  the  Cardinal  Kung  Foundation reports. It took 70 policemen to perform that  operation.  Father  Lin  Rengui  of  Fujian province  \u2018\u2018was  beaten  so  savagely  that  he vomited  blood.\u2019\u2019  Thousands  of  Falun  Gong practitioners  have  been  arrested  during  the past year; the State Department cites  \u2018\u2018credible  reports\u2019\u2019  that at  least  24 have died while in police custody. Last  month  the  Chinese  government launched  a  public  relations  mission  to  the United  States,  dispatching  exhibits,  performers and lecturers\u2014on the subject of religious  freedom,  among  others\u2014on  a  threeweek  charm  offensive.  \u2018\u2018American  voters should  get  to  know  us,\u2019\u2019  said  the  Chinese functionary  in  charge.  The  U.S.  ambassador to  China,  Joseph  Prueher,  appeared  at  a joint  new  conference  announcing  the  mission,  and  a  number  of  U.S.  business  executives\u2014from  Boeing,  Time  Warner  and  elsewhere\u2014happily  sponsored  it.  We  have  nothing  against  goodwill  cultural  exchanges,  but Chinese  and  American  officials  should  not delude  themselves  that  U.S.  suspicions  are caused  chiefly  by  prejudice  or  lack  of  understanding. On the contrary, Americans understand  just  fine  what  kind  of  government throws 81-year-old clerics into jail. f SPECIAL  ORDERS SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mrs. Under  the  Speaker\u2019s  anThe  WILSON).  nounced  policy  of  January  6,  1999,  and under  a  previous  order  of  the  House, the  following  Members  will  be  recognized for 5 minutes each. f The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.

Under  a previous  order  of  the  House,  the  gentleman  from  Michigan  (Mr.  is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr.  BONIOR.  Madam  Speaker,  last week,  as  the  other  body  was  beginning its  final  dash  toward  passage  of  the China  trade  deal,  the  Chinese  Government  jailed  yet  another  dangerous  agitator,  his  name  is  Zeng  Jingmu.  He  is 81 years of age. He is a Catholic bishop, and it is not the first time Bishop Zeng has been jailed. He was  first  imprisoned  42  years  ago. In  1983,  he  was  set  free  for  about  30 days.  Then  they  sent  him  to  prison  for 8  more  years.  In  1996,  he  was  imprisoned  once  again,  and  he  was  sentenced to 3 years of forced labor. At  the  time,  Bishop  years of age. Why  does  the  Chinese  Government feel  such  bitter  enmity  toward  the bishop? What crime did this 81-year-old man commit? Teaching the gospel. Madam  Speaker,  none  of  this  should come  as  a  surprise  to  us.  A  special commission  appointed  by  the  White House  and  this  Congress  found  that  religious  persecution  is  business  as  usual in today\u2019s China. Over  the  course  of  this  year\u2019s  trade debate,  advocates  of  normalizing  trade with China repeatedly claimed it would strengthen  the  cause  for human  rights. But  the  jailing  of  Bishop  Zeng  tells  us that  if  expanding  trade  improves human  rights,  someone  forgot  to  tell the Chinese Government. In this Capitol, the citadel of  liberty, we talk a lot about the rule of law, and we  talk  a  lot  about  freedom,  Madam Speaker.

As  an  original  cosponsor  of H.R.  4792  with  the  gentleman  from Washington  (Mr.  who  we  will hear from later, I beg of the Speaker to use her  influence to get some real safety  regulations.

INSLEE),  RECORD [From the Herald News] GAS LINE RUPTURE FORCES PATERSON EVACUATION IN no  and  no  injuries,  buildings (By Robert Ratish and Eileen Markey) PATERSON.\u2014Workers  digging  up  a  roadway on  Governor  and  Straight  streets  hit  a  natural  gas  line  Monday  morning,  releasing fumes  and  forcing  the  evacuation  of  82  residents in 15 to 20 buildings. Police  cordoned  off  four  blocks  surrounding  the  break  for  about  three  hours while  crews  from  Public  Service  Electric  & Gas  Co.  worked  to  shut  off  the  gas.  Meanwhile,  those  who  live  in  the  neighborhood waited  outside  until  emergency  crews deemed  the  area  safe.  \u2018\u2018You  could  hear  a roaring  sound.  It  sounded  like  a  train,\u2019\u2019 Councilwoman  Vera  Ames  said.  She  said  a thick smell of gas filled the area surrounding the break. There  were  were damaged. The  break  occurred  as  workers  with  the Passaic  Valley  Water  Commission  were using a backhoe to break through the street. The  crew  had  been  shutting  off  a  water  line leading  into  a  building,  said  Chief  Engineer Jim Duprey. Duprey  said  the  accident  occurred  because PSE&G  failed  to  mark  the  road  properly  for underground  lines.  \u2018\u2018When  Public  Service went  to  mark  out,  they  indicated  there  was no  piping  in  the  area  that  was  excavated,\u2019\u2019 he said. Before  digging,  the  commission  called  a hotline  maintained  by  the  state  Board  of Public Utilities  as  required  by  the  1995  \u2018\u2018One Call\u2019\u2019  law,  Duprey  said.  The  hotline  allows agencies to make one call and have all of the appropriate  utilities  mark  underground lines. A  spokesman  for  PSE&G  said  the  utility was  investigating  whether  the  gas  line  was properly marked. After  hitting  the  line,  a  PVWC  worker flagged  down  a  passing  officer  at  about  10:35 a.m., police said. Police were advised to turn off  the  lights  on  patrol  cars  and  not  leave any  engines  running  for  fear  of  sparking  the gas fumes. \u2018\u2018It  was  very  dangerous.  The  pressure  was just  phenomenal,\u2019\u2019  Mayor  Martin  G.  Barnes said. Roger  Soto,  a  service  technician  at PSE&G,  stopped  at  each  building  on  Harrison  Street  telling  workers  to  stay  outside their buildings. \u2018\u2018We  want  to  make  sure  that  no  one  is  operating  any  equipment  or  any  kind  of  engine,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re just securing the area, making sure everybody is safe.\u2019\u2019 The  chief  of  emergency  management, James  Sparano,  said  even  police  and  fire equipment  posed  a  danger.  \u2018\u2018You\u2019ll  notice even our emergency vehicles are staying way back\u2014anything can spark it,\u2019\u2019 he said. As  firefighters  and  emergency  medical technicians  stood  by,  22  young  children  attending  Bethel  Christian  Childcare  on  Auburn  Street  were  evacuated  to  School  6, where they stayed until it was safe to return. * * * f WILSON).  WASTE,  FRAUD  AND  ABUSE  IN THE  DEPARTMENT  OF  EDUCATION The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mrs. Under  a  previous  order  of  the House,  the  gentleman  from  Michigan (Mr. HOEKSTRA) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr.  HOEKSTRA.  Madam  Speaker,  as my  colleague  earlier  this  evening talked  about,  today  we  had  a  hearing in  the  Subcommittee  on  Oversight  and Investigations  of  the  Committee  on Education  and  the  Workforce  doing oversight  hearings  on  the  Department of  Education.  Let  me  just  put  this  in context for my colleagues. In  1998  and  1999,  the  Department  of Education  failed  its  financial  audit. That means  that  the  independent auditors  who  came  in  and  took  a  look  at the  financial  records  of  the  Department  of  Education  indicated  that  the way  the  numbers  were  presented  and the  background,  the  records  that  the Department  of  Education  has,  the  procedures  that  it has  in  place  and  the  interim  controls  that  it  has  in  place, gave the auditors some reason of doubt that  the  way  the  numbers  were  actually  presented  in  the  financial  statements  perhaps  did  not  accurately  reflect  the  expenditures  and  the  flow  of revenue throughout the Department. Coming  from  the  private  sector,  I know  that  when  the  financial  auditors come in and put some disclaimers in or do not give an organization a clean bill of health,  it  sets off a number of alarm bells.  Because,  basically,  what  the auditors are saying is that in this environment,  without  the  proper  financial controls  in  place,  an  environment  is created  that  is  ripe  for  waste,  fraud, and  abuse.  Over  the  last  18  months,  as we  have  been  taking  a  look  at  this problem within the Department of Education,  we  have  come  across  a  number of cases where the predictions from the auditors  have  actually  been  borne  out, and it is very, very disappointing. Today,  we  talked  about  basically what  some  would  characterize  as  an embezzlement  scheme  of  roughly  $1.9 million  out  of  the  Impact  Aid  funds that  were  diverted  into  individuals\u2019  or small  companies\u2019  checking  accounts. And,  again,  this was  not  caught  by  the internal  controls  within  the  Department  of  Education,  this  was  caught  by a  car  salesman  who  grew  suspicious with  somebody  coming  in  and  buying or  attempting  to  buy  a  very  expensive automobile. We  know  about  the  theft  ring.  Three people  have  pled  guilty,  another  three have  pleadings  before  the  court,  and there  are  a  number  of  employees  within  the  Department  of  Education  that are  suspended  without  pay.  This  is  a $300,000  theft  ring.  The  material  products  they  brought  in  were  anything from  a  61-inch  television  to  computers to VCRs to a whole series of other electronic equipment. It also includes up to $600,000  of  false  billable  overtime,  time that was billed, time that was paid, but time that was never worked. We  also  know  of  at  least  one  other major  theft  ring  within  the  Department  of  Education  that  we  are  not  at liberty  to  talk  about  because  there  are not  public  documents  that  have  been released  at  this  point  in  time.  We  also know  that  within  the  Department  of Education  the  Inspector  General  has estimated  that  improper  Pell  Grant payments  amounted  to  $177  million  in one recent year. We  know  that  real  decisions  have real  impact  on  real  people.  The  $1.9 million  embezzlement  from  the  Impact Aid  funds  impacted directly  two  school districts  in  South  Dakota.  Another  example.  Thirty-nine  students  were  recently  awarded  Jacob  Javits  scholarships.  These  are  scholarships  that  are given  to  students  who  have  excelled  at the  undergraduate  level.  The  Education Department at the Federal  level comes  back  and  says  that  they  have done  such  a  good  job,  that  the  Federal Government  is  now  going  to  fund  4 years  of  graduate  school.  That  is  great news  for  those  young  people;  that  is great  news  for  their  parents;  and  that is  great  news  for  the  undergraduate university  that  has  fostered  an  environment that has allowed these kids to excel. Just one problem: The Department of Education  notified  the  wrong  39  students.  Two  days  later  they  had  to  call back these young people and tell them, sorry,  they  were  not  the  students  that won. We  know  that  the  Department  of Education has made  $150 million  in  duplicate  payments  in  this  current  fiscal year  alone.  A  duplicate  payment  is  a vendor  supplying  an  invoice  for  products  and  services  that  they  have  provided  the  Department  of  Education.  A duplicate payment means they get paid once and they get paid again. We  have  some  serious  problems  at the  Department  of  Education.  At  the same  time  that  we  have  been  looking at  these  kinds  of  problems  within  the Department of Education, we have also had  the  opportunity  to  travel  around America  and  see  what  is  working  in education.  We  have  been  in  roughly  21 different States, and what we have seen is  some  great  education,  reform  and educational  results  happening  at  the local level. What  the  Federal  Government  needs to  learn  in  this  issue  is  where  we  are only  providing  7  percent  of  the money, but in some States we estimate that we are  providing  50  percent  of  the  paperwork,  it  is  time  for  the  Federal  Government  to  step  back  and  let  the  people  who  know  our  children\u2019s  names  decide  what  is  best  for  our  schools  and for our kids. It is time to step back and to  make  sure  that  we  get  95  cents  of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 04:44 Sep 20, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00118 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K19SE7.221 pfrm06 PsN: H19PT1 ",
            "126": "H7850 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:69) September 19, 2000 were, versus having the Talented Tenth as  W.  Du  Bois  argued,  what  an  excellent  and  outstanding  intellectual  debate. I  think  those  of  us who  look  back  on history  realize  that  there was no anger between  those  two  gentlemen;  they were  only  seeking  to  lift  the  recently freed  slaves  where  they  could  best serve.  Booker  T.  Washington,  who founded  Tuskegee  Institute,  thought  it was important for us to learn how to be carpenters and artisans,  for us to know how to build and to be plumbers, and to use our hands. He knew that slaves had just come off of the plantations, we had worked  with  our  hands,  and  he  wanted us  to  be  economically  independent  and he  saw  a  vehicle  to  do  so,  teach  them to  build  this  Nation  with  their  hands and  to  be  remunerated,  to  be  compensated. Also,  the  same  with  W.E.B.  Du  Bois, a Harvard proponent and graduate, saw that  it  was  necessary  to  take  the  Talented  Tenth  and  to  lift  them  from  the buckets  and  send  them  to  the  East Coast  at  that  time,  primarily  because there  were  no  institutions,  at  least  of plentiful  numbers,  that  could  educate the  Talented  Tenth  and  have  them  be available  to  be  the  philosophers  and the  articulators  of  the  agenda  of  the new  Negro  for  the  20th  century  as  we went into the 21th century. So  I  ask  the  question,  what  if?  What if  these  institutions  had  not  survived or  not  carried  us  through  the  segregated  20th  century  when  many  African  Americans  could  not  be  educated anyplace else. Particularly in the State of  Texas  and  in  the  Deep  South,  there were  no  places  for  the  Talented  Tenth or  those who wanted  to  lift  their buckets  where  they  were  to  be  educated, and these schools saw fit to take up the cause. As  we  moved  through  the  20th  century,  of  course,  as  we  saw  the  movement of A. Philip Randolph and Witney Young,  and  then  we  moved  into  the 1950s  and  saw  a  young man,  a  graduate of Morehouse  College,  rise  to  the  occasion  to  be  the  visionary  of  the  civil rights  movement,  Dr.  Martin  Luther King. His original training, or his basic training was  that  of  a minister,  but  he saw  fit  to  carry  the  vision  of  that movement,  and  it  was  his  leadership that  drew  young  people  out  of  institutions  all  over  this  country,  both  white and  black,  but  I  believe  that  historically  black  colleges  fueled  the  movement  of  which  he  led  that  brought young  people  from  those  institutions, because  they  lived  in  the  segregated South and they said, what can we do to begin  to  follow  Dr.  Martin  Luther King,  and  there  lie  the  sit-ins  and,  of course,  the  marches  joined  by  young people all over the Nation. Mr.  Speaker,  I  think  we  have  had  a special  week  and  I  have  enjoyed  participating  with  the  gentleman  from Maryland  (Mr.  this  week,  as the  President  has  named  this  week  in honor of historically black colleges. We were  gratified  to  have  the  Democratic HOYER)  Caucus  host  I  imagine  over  100  leaders of  these  colleges.  They  came  to  petition us to have us listen to them and to have us share our vision with them. I  would  just  like  to  note,  because  I know  of  the  gentleman\u2019s  record  in  the Committee  on  Appropriations,  that each  of  us  could  count  opportunities where  we  have  tried  to  increase  their funding.  As  a  member  of  the  Committee on Science, I thought it was important  to  ensure  that  the  Civilian Space  Authorization  Act  of  1998  and 1999  would  ensure  that  there  would  be access  by  these  colleges  for  direct  research  programs  to  work  with  the FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration,  to  ensure  under  their  research, engineering  and  development  authorization  act,  in  particular,  that  again, undergraduate  students  could  do  the research that they needed. Mr. Speaker, let me quickly conclude by  noting  as  well  that  the  NASA  minority  research,  which  is  an  important aspect  of  this  program,  and  the  land grant  programs  are  important  to  be funded  by  some  of  the  agricultural  authorization. I  think  the  key  that  I  would  like  to make  sure  that  we  are  aware  of  is  the answer  to  what  if?  We  would  be  left with  I  think a gaping hole,  to not have the  rich  history  of  the  historically black  colleges,  Oakwood  College,  now chaired  by  Chairman  Calvin  Rock.  We would  not  be  able  to  cite Dr.  Freeman, Dr.  Joshua  Hill,  Dr.  Polly  Turner,  Dr. John B. Coleman, all surrounding Prairie View A&M and Texas Southern University doing all great works. This  is  an  important  part  of  our  history,  I  say  to  the  gentleman,  and  I  believe  this  is  an  important  night,  because  we  have  allowed  ourselves  to  reflect  and  to  congratulate.  I  think  our concluding  commitment  should  be,  as our  presidents  have  asked  us,  to  bring them  into  the  21st  century  and  catapult  them  with  the  research  institutions  of  this  Nation  of  high  order.  Let them be on the same plane as our institutions  that  are  noted  as  the  Ivy Leaguers,  which  I  attended  one  of those.  But  I  want  them  to  hear  our voices of appreciation and our commitment  that  we  believe  their  role  is  extremely  vital  for  the  future  of  our young people and the 21st century. With  that,  there  is  much  more  I could  say,  but  I  yield  back  to  the  gentleman,  and  I  thank  him  for  the  time. Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  in  recognition  of  the  special  role  that  Historically  Black  Colleges  and Universities  (HBCU)  have  played  in  the  education  of  our  Nation\u2019s  young  people.  Twentythree  states,  along  with  the  District  of  Columbia  and  the  Virgin  Islands  are  homes  to HBCUs.  I have  the honor of  recognizing Texas Southern  University,  a  HBCU  and  a  constituent  of  the  18th  Congressional  District  of Texas,  which  I  serve.  Texas  Southern  University  like  so  many  of  the  HBCUs  was  established  in  1947  as  a means  of  educating  young African  Americans  who  wanted  to  experience the  full  force  of  the  American  Dream  through higher  education.  It  was  first  formed  under  the name  Texas  State  University  for  Negroes,  and became  the  first  state  supported  institution  in the  City  of  Houston,  Texas.  The  first  president of  Texas  Southern  University  was  the  Honorable  Dr.  R.  O\u2019Hara  Lanier,  U.S.  Minister  to  Liberia. Although  Texas  Southern  University  was first  formed  to  educate  African  Americans  it has become  the most ethnically diverse  school of higher  learning  in  the State of Texas. Texas  Southern  University  has  awarded over  35,000  degrees  and  presently  offers  54 baccalaureate  degree  programs,  30  master\u2019s degree  programs;  the  Doctor  of  Education  degree  in  six  programs;  the Doctor  of  Philosophy in  Environmental  Toxicology;  and  two  graduate  professional  degrees  a  Doctor  of  Pharmacy  and  the  Doctor  of  Jurisprudence.  The University\u2019s  Robert  J.  Terry  Library  has  a  collection  of  over  913,000  holdings.  The  campus also  hosts  a  25,000-watt  FM  radio  station  that serves  as  a  teaching  and  learning  laboratory for  communications. Another  HBCU  located  in  the  state  of  Texas is  Prairie  View  A&M  University.  Prairie  View A&M  University  is  the  second  oldest  public  institution  of  higher  education  in  Texas,  originated  in  the  Texas  Constitution  of  1876.  Originally  the  University  was  named  the  A&M  College  of  Texas  for  Colored  Youths  and  opened on  March  11,  1878.  Initially  the  College  was designed  by  the  Texas  legislature  to  provide education  to  teachers. In  1945  the  name  of  the  College  was changed  to  Prairie  View  University,  and  the school  was  authorized  to  offer,  \u2018\u2018as  need arises\u2019\u2019  all  courses  that  were  offered  at  the University of Texas. Another  HBCU  that  is  close  to my  heart  and carries  the  proud  heritage  of  education  excellence  is  Oakwood  College  located  in  Huntsville,  Alabama.  This  college  unlike  the  previous  HBCU  is  not  a  public  institution,  but  is operated  by  the  General  Conference  of  Seventh-day  Adventists.  Ellen  G.  White  declared that  it  was  God\u2019s  purpose  that  the  school should  be  placed  in  the  City  of  Huntsville,  Alabama. Oakwood  College\u2019s  beginning  can  be  traced to  1895,  when  the  General  Conference  Association  sent  a  three-man  educational  committee  to  the  South  to  select  and  purchase property  for  a  school  for  black  youth.  They began with  four  buildings  four  teachers  and  16 students,  eight  women  and  eight  men;  Oakwood  Industrial  School  opened  its  doors  on November 16, 1896. The  faculty  consisted  of  H.S.  Shaw,  A.F. Hughes,  Hatie  Andre,  and  the  principal,  Solon M.  Jacobs.  For  the  benefit  of  both  the  institution  and  community,  the  school  maintained and  operated  a  line  of  industries.  Students and  teachers  worked  beside  each  other  in  agriculture,  blacksmith,  bricklaying,  broom  making,  canning,  carpentry,  chaircaning,  clothes manufacturing,  cotton  manufacturing,  dairying, gardening,  log milling and woodworking. The  beginning  of  each  of  these  institutions was  a  need  and  the  will  to  see  that  need  met. I  commend  those  hundreds  of  instructors,  visionaries,  students,  parents,  and  communities who  made  higher  education  a  reality  for  African  American  young  people  in  our  nation.  My regret  is  that  the  precious  gift  of  higher  education  was  not  available  to  every  African American  young  person,  and  that  desegregation  came  so  many  generations  after  the  institution of  slavery was ended.

I  am  glad  the  gentleman  brought up  the  issue  of  saving  Medicare,  because,  indeed,  if  no  changes  are  made to  the  Medicare  system,  we  all  know that  it  is  not  actuarially  sound,  and  it will  meet  its  demise.  The  program itself will meet its demise within about 20 or 25 years. And  when  my  generation,  the  baby boom  generation,  reaches  retirement age,  the  Medicare  program  will  not  be able  to  provide  benefits  to  my  generation. So the gentleman makes an excellent point. The gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Mrs.  also  mentioned  some  of  the  reforms  that  we  include,  reforms  of  Medicare  that  we  include  in  our  prescription  drug  plan, which  will  facilitate  the  transition from  the  current Medicare  system  to  a Medicare  system  that  will  be  stronger, that  will  rely  on  competition  in  the private  sector  to  drive  down  costs  in the Medicare system and save Medicare for the  long hall so that my generation and  generations  following  mine  will have the benefit of this program. I  appreciate  the  gentleman  for  yielding  to  me  and  saying  that  our  plan does that, but the Vice President\u2019s does not. Mr. THOMAS.  I thank the gentleman for  his  comments.  The  solvency  the day  after  tomorrow  is  important,  the needs  for  tomorrow  is  important,  but frankly  we  should  not  go  one  day longer  than  necessary  to  provide  seniors  with  prescription  drugs,  and  we ought  not  to  keep  talking  about  the issue.  We  did  something,  we  passed  it, especially  when  talking  apparently coming  from  the  Vice  President  is  not truthful in the first place. Mr.  MCCRERY.  We  passed  it  sponsible way. I would admit. Mrs.  JOHNSON  of  Connecticut.  Mr. Speaker,  I  am  very  proud  we  are  doing it  in  not  only  a way  that will  save  and strengthen Medicare  for  future  generations and provides more choice  for  seniors,  but  it  provides  more  health  care for  seniors.  Ours  is  the  only  bill  that covers  off-label  uses  of  drugs.  Since most of the cancer patients are over 65, and  since  many  of  the  cancer  treatments  involve  off  label  uses  of  drugs, only  our  bill  provides  coverage  for most cancer treatments. So  we  not  only  do  it  in  an  efficient, cost  effective  way  that  will  strengthen Medicare  in  the  long  run  for  current seniors and  future  retirees, but we provide  more  choices  and  more  health care.  We  need  for  the  President  to weigh  in  now  and  get  our  bill  to  his desk  so  every  senior  in  America  can have  drugs  as  a  part  of  Medicare  now. Mr.  THOMAS.  Our  bill  provides  that competition  in  negotiation,  and  the only  thing  I  am  really  pleased  about in  a  rewith Governor George W. Bush\u2019s plan is he  gets  it,  he  understands  the  need  for that competition in negotiation to provide  a  better  product,  flexibility  and choice,  but  ultimately  at  a  cheaper price. My  only  hope  is  that  as  we  continue this  very  important  debate,  my  druthers would  be  that we  do  not  debate, we show  action.  We  took  that  action  in our hands, we passed a bill off the floor of  the  House,  we  would  like  to  deal with  legislation moving  forward,  but  if it  is  apparently  the  way  that  the Democrats  have  chosen  to  be  rhetoric, to  talk  about  the  needs,  then  I  think, at  the  very  minimum,  what  we  would hope  is  that  the  Vice  President,  the Democrats\u2019  nominee  for  President, would  not  play  fast  and  loose  with  the facts  that,  in  fact,  the  debate  be  a truthful one. This is a serious matter. It is not just partisan  rhetoric.  It  is  whether  or  not a  senior  gets  the  kind  of  lifesaving drugs  they  deserve  at  a  price  they  can afford. The  bipartisan  Republican  plan  that passed  the  House  does  that.  We  do  not want  rhetoric.  We  do  not  want  debate. We want action. We have  taken action. It  is  now  up  to  the  President  and  others.  I  thank  both  of  my  colleagues  for participating  and  our  colleague  from Pennsylvania as well. f NIGHTSIDE  CHAT The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. PEASE).  Under  the  Speaker\u2019s  announced  policy  of  January  6,  1999,  the gentleman  from  Colorado  (Mr. MCINNIS) is recognized for 60 minutes. Mr.  MCINNIS.  Mr.  Speaker,  as  my colleagues  recall,  last  evening  I  had  an opportunity  to  address  my  colleagues and  to  speak  about  a  number  of  different  subjects.  I  would  like  to  kind  of do  a  quick  summary  or  at  least  some additions  or  amendments  to  my  comments last night based on some of what I saw today. First of all, as many of my colleagues will  recall  last  night  I  spoke  about Pueblo,  Colorado,  and  the  home  of  heroes.  This  week  is  Patriots  Week  in Pueblo,  Colorado,  and  there  we  are going  to  honor  over  100  recipients  of the Medal of Honor. These  are  real  heros,  as  I  said  last night,  and  I  read  the  definition  of  heroes.  And  we  do  not  have  to  explain  to people  what  courage  is  and  how  courageous  and  brave  these  particular  individuals  were,  we  know  that  just  because  they  are  recipients  of  the  Medal of  Honor,  they  are  amongst  the  most recognized,  courageous  and  brave  people in the history of this country. I  say  with  some  sadness  today  that we  lost  one  of  our  heroes  who  passed away  at  age  74,  and  I  thought  I  would just  read  a  brief  paragraph  or  two about  this  particular  hero.  Douglas  T. Jacobson, Douglas T.  Jacobson who  received  the  Medal  of  Honor  was  a  Marine  private,  private  in  the  Marine Corps  for  single  handedly  storming enemy  positions  on  Iwo  Jima,  an  action  that  resulted  in  the  deaths  of  75 Japanese  soldiers,  died  in  August.  He had congestive heart failure. Iwo Jima is often remembered for the photograph  of  the  five Marines  and  the Navy  Combat  Medic  raising  the  American  flag  on  February  23,  1945,  but  the carnage  of  what  occurred  there  was one,  as  described,  as  one  of  the  most savage  and  most  costly  battles  in  the history of the Marine Corps. This was taken from the obituary out of the New York Times. Unfortunately, obviously,  Mr.  Jacobson  will  not  be  in Pueblo, Colorado, but  to his  family, we mourn  his  passing  and  want  them  to know in Pueblo this week we will think about him. We will  think about  the action  that  he  took  on  behalf  of  this country. Moving  on  to  another  subject.  I talked  last  night  about  the  entertainment world, specifically I focused in on some  of  the  video  games  that  we  can pick  up  or  rent  at  the  store  or  pick  up or  go  down  to  the  video  arcade  and play.  I  showed  you  a  demonstration  of some  of  them,  including  one  which  is called  the  Kingpin.  And  on  the  Kingpin,  as  I mentioned  last  night,  you  are actually able to put this video game on your  video  and  focus  in  on  the  exit wounds of the person that you shot. The game  itself encourages you  to be like  a  tough  gang  person  and  wipe  out your  opponents.  And  it  is  a  gross  miscarriage  of,  in my  opinion,  of  responsibility,  community  responsibility,  by some  individuals,  not  all  individuals, but  by  some  individuals  in  the  entertainment industry. Mr.  Speaker,  I  said  yesterday  in  my comments  that  I  felt  that  I  probably represented 1 percent, maybe 2 percent, 3  percent  of  that  entertainment  industry that put that kind of trash out. Tonight while I was waiting for my opportunity  to  address  my  colleagues,  I  was back reading the New York Times. And  I  noticed  a  story  and  I  would like  to  say  or  comment  on  a  response that  was  given  to  our  concern  in  the United  States  Congress,  our  concerns as  parents,  parents  who  have  young children  that many of our  constituents do, we expressed the concern of a  lot of people  and  a  lot  of  communities  across this country. Here  is  the  response  of  one  of  the people of the entertainment industry, a guy  named  Larry  Casinof,  he  is  president  of  Threshold  Entertainment,  a company  that  makes,  among  other things, movies based on action oriented video  games  like  Mortal  Kombat  and Duke Nukem. Here is his comment about what Congress  says  about  these  video  games, about  what  parents  and  communities are  saying  about  these  video  games.  I think  it  is  a  bunch  of  weasels  scrambling  for  votes;  that  is  exactly  what this  fellow  calls my  colleagues  up  here who  express  concern  about  the  entertainment  industry  that  small  portion of  the  entertainment  industry  which puts  this  kind  of  garbage  out  there  to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 04:44 Sep 20, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00134 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K19SE7.251 pfrm06 PsN: H19PT1 ",
            "142": "H7866 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:69) September 19, 2000 b not  get  publicized.  For  example,  4  percent,  or  595,640  students,  enrolled  in grades  nine  through  12  have  used  cocaine  according  to  the  most  recent study in the past month. 2300 That  is  up  dramatically  over  again the  beginning  of  this  administration. Methamphetamines,  which  were  not even  on  the  charts  at  the  beginning  of this  administration,  we  have  99.1  percent  or  1,355,018  students  enrolled  in grades  9  through  12  have  now  used methamphetamine,  almost  10  percent of  the  students  enrolled  in  grades  9 through 12. If you want to worry about drugs and prescription drugs  for  elderly, and  that is  a  serious  concern  that  we  must  address,  and  we  must  make  certain  that those  who  are  elderly  and  infirm  or  in need have prescription drugs, that is an important  topic.  But  this  topic  that  I present  tonight  is  extremely  important,  particularly  to  our  young  people, when  again  we  have  a  startling  statistics like this. Mr. Speaker, almost 10 percent of our young  people  have  tried methamphetamines, and we have again 2.4  percent  of  our  students  enrolled  in grades  9  through  12  have  used  heroin. Heroin,  which  we  find  now  in  a  more deadly  and  potent  form  than  we  ever have,  and  I  have  cited  the  increases  in marijuana  use,  which  have  nearly  doubled  in  the  terms  of  this  administration.  2.8  percent  of  the  students  enrolled  in  grade  9  through  12  have  injected  illegal  drugs,  that  is  268,038  students, again, in our most recent report. These  are  not  statistics  again  that you  will  hear  from  the  administration, and  the  media  unfortunately  does  not want  to  cover  this  problem.  They,  the media,  have  a  more  liberal  bent,  and they  have,  along  with  the  administration, been guilty of sweeping this problem under the table. One  of  the  problems  that  we  have, how  did  we  get  ourselves  into  a  situation  with  these  statistics,  with  drugs, drug-induced  deaths  now  exceeding homicides  in  the  United  States.  I  want to say it was not easy. It took the Clinton  administration  almost  7  years  to dismantle  and  systematically  take piece  by  piece  apart  what  was  a  very effective war on drugs. Mr.  Speaker,  in  fact,  if  we  look  at  a period  from  1985  to  1992,  we  saw  over  a 40  percent  decrease  in  drug  use  in  this country.  The  Clinton-Gore  administration  has  failed  to make  the  drug  war  a top  national  priority.  Now,  how  can  a President  of  the  United  States  make drug  enforcement,  drug  prevention, drug  education,  drug  interdiction  or  a war on drug real when only eight times in  7  years,  just  prior  to  our  work  this year on the Colombian package, did the President  mention  the  war  on  the drugs in his public addresses. As a  result, we have witnessed an  explosion  in  drug use  and  abuse. We have witnessed  an  incredible  amount  of  production  of  coca,  the  base  for  cocaine and  opium  poppy,  the  base  for  heroin, in  Colombia.  And  I  have  cited  in  past special  order  presentations  how  this administration  systematically  first stopped  in  1994  information  sharing  to the  chagrin  of  even  the  Democrats, who  protested  their move, who  stopped providing  surveillance  information that  could  be  used  in  shoot  down  by other  countries  trying  to  stop  drugs within  other  countries  borders,  not U.S.  forces,  but  other  countries  which saw  a  resurgence  in  drugs  leaving  the source countries. We  saw  again  a  policy  where  aid  and assistance was blocked for some 3 years by a misapplication of our drug certification  law,  and  we  saw  the  stopping  of aid  even  appropriated  and  designated by  the  Congress  to  get  to  Colombia that  did  not  get  to  Colombia,  and  then finally  when  some  few  helicopters  that we  asked  3  years  and  4  years  for  to  get there  to  get  to  the  illegal  narcotics  to go  after  the  traffickers  in  the  mountain terrain. When they finally arrived, it  was  almost  in  a  ludicrous  situation and a condition that they arrived without proper armoring which led us to require  this  Congress  to  pass  a  $1.3  billion package in emergency funding just recently.  And  we  saw  the  President  of the  United  States  attempt  to  grandstand  and  also  blur  the  issue  of  the tragedy  that  he  had  helped  create  in Colombia  through  very  specific missteps and policy. Despite that billion dollars in aid, we still see a tide of  illegal narcotics coming  into  this  country,  that  is  because our  Panama  forward  surveillance  post was  closed  down,  the  administration bungled  the  negotiation  of  keeping  our antinarcotics  surveillance  base  in  Panama, and it may be some 2 years before we  get  the  surveillance  capability,  the forward-operating  capability,  the interdiction capability. That  is why we have an incredible supply of drugs coming  in  and  they  are  killing  our  young people. Why  are  they  coming  in?  Again,  because  of  some  direct  and  inappropriate missteps by this administration to stop drugs  cost  effectively  at  their  source and  also  stop  them  by  taking  the military  out  of  the  surveillance  business. And  we  know  that  this  administration from  1992  to  1999,  according  to  this  report  provided  to  me  as  chair  of  the Subcommittee  on  Criminal  Justice, Drug  Policy  and  Human  Resources, this  administration  cut  antinarcotics flights,  they  declined  from  some  46,264 to  14,770  or  some  68  percent  from  fiscal year  1992  to  1999.  That  is  why  we  have a  flood  of  illegal  narcotics,  heroin  and other  drugs  in  our  streets  and  in  our communities. This report further details, again prepared  by  the  General  Accounting  Office,  that  the  administration  cut  ship days devoted to supporting interdiction of  suspected  maritime  illegal  drug shipments,  which  declined  62  percent from  1992  through  1999.  So  if  you  wonder why we have illegal narcotics in incredible  quantities  coming  in  to  our country, here in fact is the evidence. When  you  close  down  a  real  war  on drugs, the result is death in our streets and  now  drug-induced  deaths  have  exceeded  homicides  in  our  land  for  the first time. Mr.  Speaker,  the  other  problem  that we have and many young people do not realize,  and  even  adults  who  are  using the  narcotics  that  are  coming  in,  for example,  the  heroin  that  is  on  the streets  today,  the  purity  levels  are  incredibly high. In  the  1970s  and  1980s,  there  were  3 percent  and  4  percent,  5  percent  purity levels  in  the  heroin  that  was  on  the streets.  Today  it  is  not  uncommon  to find  70  percent  or  80  percent  pure  heroin when mixed with other drugs or alcohol  is  resulting  in  the  deaths  druginduced  deaths,  that we  have  seen  that again  have  now  skyrocketed  above murders  in  the  United  States.  Even though  the  Republican-led  Congress has  instituted  a  $1  billion  antidrug media  campaign,  we  still  see  us  losing the  war  on  drugs  in  the  United  States for several reasons. First of all, we have not had a war on drugs  since  1993.  The  Clinton  administration, one of its first steps was to dismantle  the  drug  czar\u2019s  office  and  slash the  positions  from  some  120  down  to several  dozen.  We  have  helped  build that  back up  and with  the  aid  of  a new drug  czar,  Barry  McCaffrey,  we  have made some progress in putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. The  interdiction  and  source  country programs  are  both  cut  by  some  nearly 50 percent, and  that was a  further blow to  any  effective  war  on  the  drugs.  And even with the institution of a $1 billion media  campaign  matched  by  a  billion dollars  and  donated,  we  are  still  far away from winning or recreating a real war  on  drugs.  Unfortunately,  we  found that  in  our  subcommittee,  the  reports that  we  are  getting  even  dismay  us more.  Heroin  users,  as  I  said,  are  even younger than ever. We  are  finding  also  that  emergency room  reports  and  incidents  of  drug overdose  in  our  hospitals  and  treatment  centers  are  also  dramatically  on the increase. Mr. Speaker,  I am  told by  some  local officials  that  the  only  reason  that  we do not have  even higher  death  rates  by drug-induced deaths  is that,  in  fact, we have  gotten  a  little  bit  better  at  the emergency  treatment,  but  emergency room  doctors  reported  in  1997  and  1998 that  heroin  is  involved  in  four  to  six visits  out  of  every  100,000  by  use,  12  to 17  up  from  1  in  100,000  in  1990.  For young  adults,  from  18  to  25,  41  emergency  room  visits  in  every  100,000  involved  heroin  up  from  19  in  1991. Among women, in general, the numbers have  doubled  in  a  decade.  Again,  more troubling  information  that  comes  before our subcommittee. Mr.  Speaker,  we  also  have  reports that  dismay  me  not  only  about  illegal narcotics  but  about  other  types  of  addictive habits, and we have heard  some talk  from  this  administration  about cutting  down  tobacco  use.  Unfortunately,  from  the  President,  from  the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 04:56 Sep 20, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00142 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\K19SE7.264 pfrm06 PsN: H19PT1 ",
            "150": "S8668  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE September 19, 2000  tolerate  of  mass  engages  world\u2014a  signal  that  we  will  the  proliferation  of  weapons  destruction\u2014a  practice  China  in openly.  In  terms  of  our  overall  trade  policy,  we  also  cannot  send  a  signal  to  our  neighbors  in  the  Western  Hemisphere  that says we are only interested in concentrating  on  the  Chinese  market.  Since  so much  time  and  energy  and  resources  has  been  directed  to  liberalizing  trade  in  China,  it  may  be  a  surprise  to  some  that  China  represents  only two percent of our foreign sales.  To  keep  it  in  proper  perspective,  there  was  no  one  who  estimates  that  percentage  will  go  beyond  21\u20442 or  3  percent  in  the  immediate  future. Two percent  of  our  total  foreign  markets  is  only  $13  billion  in  U.S.  sales  to  China.  Now,  compare  that  to markets  closer  to  home.  Last  year,  Canada  was  our  number  one  export  destination,  with  $167  billion  in  U.S.  sales,  while  Mexico  was  our  second  largest  export  market  with  $87  billion  in  sales.  Further,  our  exports  to  Brazil  ($13.2  billion)  last  year  exceeded  our  sales  to  China.  And  what\u2019s  more,  forty-four  percent  of  our  exports remained right here  in our own  hemisphere.  Those  $13  billion  in  sales  to  China  pale  in  comparison  to  trade  within  our  hemisphere.  Yet,  the  Administration  and  the  business  community  have  made  granting  PNTR  to  China  their  single-minded  trade  focus.  This  narrow  agenda has not come without cost.  Because  the  Administration  has  not  emphasized expanding  free  trade  in our  hemisphere,  other  nations  are  taking  the  lead  in  seizing  the economic opportunities that are right in our backyard.  Our inaction in this hemisphere has essentially  made  it  easier  for  Europe,  Asia,  and  Canada  to  significantly  expand  their  exports  throughout  Latin  America. The European Union (EU), for  example, is now Brazil\u2019s largest trading  partner.  The  EU\u2019s  exports  to  Brazil  have  grown  255  percent  from  1990  to  1998.  Additionally,  during  that  riod,  Asia  experienced  an  1664  percent  increase  in  its  exports to Argentina.  The  next  administration  and  the  business community need to pay attention  to  our  own  hemisphere.  That  means  that  the  next  administration  and  the  next  Congress  need  to  pass  fast-track  trading  authority  and  move  toward  a  hemispheric  free  trade  area.  It  is  imperative  that  we  do  this.  That  means  that  we  will  need  to  expand  the  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement, which,  over  this  last  decade,  has  advanced  economic  cooperation  and  growth  between  the  United  States  and  Mexico,  increasing  U.S.  exports  to  Mexico by 207 percent. And, that means  that we must abandon this very narrow  focus  with  which  the  current  administration  has  viewed  trade  policy  and  start  widening  the  lens  to  be  more  inclusive of the markets right here in our  own  backyard.  This  is  significant  unfinished  business  that  our  next  Presisame  peincredible  growth  of  dent  and  our  next  Congress  and  the  American people will have to address.  But,  even  more  significant  in  terms  of  our  unfinished  business  are  the  considerable  national  security  issues  at  stake  regarding  our  overall  relationship with China. I say that because this  is China we are  talking about. China  is  different.  China,  as  my  colleagues  all  know,  is  unlike  any  other  country  in  the  world.  China  is  a  major  power\u2014a  nuclear  power\u2014and  China  is  the  world\u2019s  major  proliferator  of  weapons  of mass destruction.  Sadly,  this  administration  has  failed  to stop the Chinese government\u2019s weapons  proliferation.  Sadly,  this  administration  has  not  demonstrated  the  kind  of  leadership  necessary  to  prevent  China  from  manufacturing  and  selling  weapons technology worldwide.  Like the United States, China is a co-  signator  of  the  Nuclear  Non-Proliferation  Treaty,  yet  over  the  last  decade,  its  government  has  violated  the  Nuclear  Non-Proliferation  Treaty  willingly,  openly,  and  egregiously.  Their  actions  are  well  documented.  For  example, Washington Times National  Security  reporter,  Bill  Gertz,  writes  in  his recent book:  [f]or at  least a decade, China has  routinely  carried  out  covert  weapons  and  technology  sales  to  the Middle East  and  South Asia,  despite hollow promises to the contrary.  The  PRC  has  shown  no  remorse  for  its past actions\u2014and certainly no inclination  to  change  them.  Rather,  China  has flaunted\u2014openly\u2014its violations.  At  the  beginning  of  the  last  decade,  Pakistan was believed to possess a very  modest  nuclear  weapons  program\u2014one  that  was  inferior  to  India\u2019s  program.  Our  own  laws  effectively  banned  U.S.  government  assistance  to  Pakistan  because  of  its  decision  to  go  nuclear,  and  our  sanctions  laws  contained  tough  penalties  for  any  nation  attempting  to  feed Pakistan\u2019s nuclear hunger.  That was  then. Today, China has  single-handedly worked to change the balance  of  power  in  South  Asia  and,  in  turn, has made the region  far more different and far more dangerous.  Today,  according  to  news  reports,  Pakistan  possesses  more  weapons  than  India and has a better capability to deliver  them.  President  Clinton  stated  earlier  this  year  that  South  Asia  has  now  become  the  most  dangerous  place  in  the  world.  We  have  China  to  thank  for that.  The significant change in the balance  of  power  between  Pakistan  and  India  was  engineered  by  China,  which  provided  Pakistan  with  critical  technology to enrich and mold uranium, M\u2013  11  missile  equipment  and  technology,  and  expertise  and  equipment  to  enable  Pakistan  to  have  its  own  missile  production capability.  What  has  this  Administration  done  to  change  this  behavior?  Essentially  nothing.  Time  after  time,  as  reporters,  like  Bill  Gertz,  uncovered  extraordinary  information on proliferation activities,  this  Administration  failed  to  impose  even  the  mildest  sanctions  against  China  as  required  by  law.  For  example,  in  1995,  at  the  same  time  this  Administration  was  aware  of  China\u2019s  transfer  of  sensitive  nuclear  technology  to  Pakistan,  the  Administration  was  seeking  to  weaken  our  non-  proliferation  laws  against  Pakistan.  And,  rather  than  aggressively  use  the  sanctions  laws  on  the  books  to  try  to  bring  about  a  change  in  China\u2019s  behavior,  this  Administration  sought  to  find  ways to  show  it had  reached a common  understanding  with  China  to  prohibit  these  activities  and  thus  avoid  sanctions.  However, according to the Central Intelligence  Agency\u2019s  unclassified  bi-annual  report  to  Congress  on  the  proliferation  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  China  remained  a  \u2018\u2018key  supplier\u2019\u2019  last year of weapons and missile assistance to Pakistan.  In  the  Middle  East,  it\u2019s  the  same  story.  News  reports  have  documented  China\u2019s  contributions  to  Iran\u2019s  nuclear  development  and  ballistic  and  cruise  missile  programs,  including  anti-ship  missiles  that  are  a  threat  to  our  naval  presence  and  commercial  shipping  in  the Persian Gulf. Further, the CIA\u2019s bi-  annual  report  also  confirmed  that  Chinese  government  multi-nationals  are  assisting  the  Libyan  government  in  building  a  more  advanced  missile  program.  As  it  stands,  international  rules  of  conduct and pledges to our government  to forego its proliferation activity have  not  deterred  China\u2019s  arms-building  practices.  Further,  this  administration  has  not  enforced U.S.  non-proliferation  laws  adequately  nor  effectively.  The  Chinese  government  certainly  does  not  take  our  government  seriously  on  the  question  of  weapons  proliferation\u2014and  frankly,  why  should  they?  The  current  Administration  hasn\u2019t  been  a  leader  in  encouraging  nations  to  honor  international  non-proliferation  agreements.  Consequently,  weapons  of  mass  destruction  are  in  more  questionable  hands than ever before.  Last  year,  a  bipartisan  commission  headed  by  former  CIA  Director,  John  Deutch,  concluded  that  our  Federal  Government  is  not  equipped  to  fight  nuclear  proliferation.  What  does  that  say  about  our  international  credibility?  What  does  that  say  about  our  ability  to  prevent  the  proliferation  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction?  What  it  says  is  that  our  diminished  credibility  may oblige other countries who are adversaries  of  Pakistan,  Iran,  and  Libya  to build their own weapons capabilities  to counter these emerging threats.  In simple terms, the current administration  has  not  led  on  these  proliferation issues. That is why we should have  passed  Senator  amendment last week.  The  Thompson  amendment  was  important  because  it would  have  given  us  the  ability  to  hold  the  People\u2019s Republic  of  China,  and  any  nation,  accountable  for  proliferating  weapons  of  mass  destruction  and  the  means  to  deliver  them. The bottom  line  is that  if we are  THOMPSON\u2019s  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:26 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S19SE0.REC S19SE0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",
            "158": "S8676  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE September 19, 2000  HELMS I  brought  another  amendment  to  the  floor.  I  said  based  upon  China\u2019s  agreement  with  the  United  States  in  1991,  a  memorandum  of  understanding,  and  then  another  agreement  in  1993,  which  the  President  used  as  evidence  that  we  would  delink  human  rights  with  trade  policy  with  China,  we  should  call  on  China  to  live  up  to  its  agreement  that  it  would  not  export  to  this  country  products made by prison labor. Many of  these people are  in prison because  they  have  spoken  out  for  democracy  and  human rights. That amendment lost.  I  brought  another  amendment  to  the  floor  of  the  Senate,  which  was  an  amendment  that  said  men  and  women  in China  should have  the  right  to organize  and  bargain  collectively;  they  should  be  able  to  form  an  independent  union.  I  cited  as  evidence  Kathy  Lee  and  Wal-Mart  paying  8  cents  an  hour  from  8  in  the  morning  until  10  at  night\u2014mainly  to  young  women.  They  get  1  day  off  a  month.  I  said  shouldn\u2019t  we  at  least  say  we  want  to  extend  the  right  to  annually  review  trade  relations until China lives up to this standard? That amendment lost.  Then  I  offered  an  amendment  with  Senator  from  North  Carolina,  a  broad human  rights amendment,  citing  one  human  rights  report  after  another  saying  that  China  needed  to  live  up  to  the  basic  standard  of  decency  when  it  comes  to  respecting  the  human  rights  of  its  people.  That  is  a  sacred  issue  to  me\u2014anywhere  in  the  world.  That  amendment lost.  I  want  to  conclude  my  remarks  on  the  floor  of  the  Senate  in  three  ways.  First,  I  hope  I  am  wrong,  but  I  believe  we  will  deeply  regret  the  stampede  to  pass  this  legislation  and  the  way  in  which  we  have  taken  all  the  human  rights, religious freedom, right to organize, all of those concerns, and we have  put  them  in  parentheses  and  in  brackets  as  if  they  don\u2019t  exist  and  are  not  important.  I  think  we  will  regret  that.  I  think  we  will  regret  that  because  if  we  truly  understand  the  implications  of  living  in  an  international  economy,  it means this.  It means that if we care about human  rights,  we  have  to  care  about  human  rights  in  every  country.  If  we  care  about the environment\u2014not just in our  country\u2014if  we  care  about  the  right  to  organize\u2014not  just  in  our  country\u2014if  we  care  about  deplorable  child  labor  conditions,  we  have  to  be  concerned  about  that  in  every  country.  When  we  as  the  Senate  and  as  Senators  do  not  speak  out  on  human  rights,  we  are  all  diminished.  When  we  have  not  spoken  out  on  human  rights  in  China,  I  think  our silence is a betrayal.  I will make two other final points.  I  have  heard  my  colleagues  argue  \u2018\u2018exports,  exports.\u2019\u2019  I have  spoken plenty about this  legislation, and I will not  repeat everything I said but just to say  I  think  the  evidence  is  pretty  clear.  Not  more  exports  but  more  investment\u2014there is a difference.  I  think  what  will  happen  is  China  will  become  the  largest  export  platform with low-wage labor under deplorable  working  conditions  exporting  products abroad, including to our country,  and  our  workers  will  lose  their  jobs. Frankly, we will be  talking about  not raising the living standard of working  people  but  lowering  the  living  standard.  On  agriculture,  I  think  there  was  a  piece  in  the  New  York  Times  on  Sunday.  Every  day  there  is  an  article  in  the  newspaper  about  China.  It  is  not  a  pretty  picture.  It  is  as  if  many  of  my  colleagues  want  to  turn  their  gaze  away  from  the  glut  in  production\u2014  about  the  protests,  about  people  being  arrested for the protests.  Frankly,  as  to  the  argument  that  we  are  going  to  have  many  more  exports  to  China  and  that  is  going  to  be  the  salvation  of  family  farmers\u2014the President  of  the  United  States  came  out  to  Minnesota  and  basically  made  that  argument\u2014we  can  have  different  views  about human rights and whether or not  there  will  be  more  respect  for  human  rights  as we have more  economic  trade  relations  in  China,  but  so  far  that  is  not  the evidence.  I can understand how  people  honestly  disagree.  I  don\u2019t  believe  that  most-favored-nation  status  or normal trade relations with China is  the salvation of family farmers for this  country.  I want my words  in  this  debate  to  be  heard.  I  want  to  stick  by  these  words,  and  I  want  to  be  held  accountable.  I  want  every  other  colleague  who  has  made  such  a  claim,  that  this  will  be  the  salvation  for  our  family  farmers  in  this  country,  to  also  be  held  accountable.  Finally,  I  say  to  Senators  that  I  believe  we  will  lose  this.  And  people  in  good  conscience  have  different  viewpoints. I can\u2019t help speaking with some  strong  feeling  at  the  end  of  this  debate  to  say  this:  I  will  look  at  this  debate  and  vote  with  a  sense  of  history.  One-  hundred  years  ago,  our  economy  was  changing.  We  were  moving  to  a  national  economy\u2014industrialized  national  economy.  You  had  farmers,  laborers,  religious  communities,  populists,  and  women.  And  they made  a  set  of  standards.  They  wanted  an  8-hour  day.  They  wanted  to  abolish  some  of  the  worst  child  labor  conditions\u2014antitrust  action;  women  wanted  the  right  to  vote;  direct  election  of  U.S.  Senators.  They  wanted  the  right  to  organize  and  bargain  collectively.  The  Pinkertons  were  killing  labor  organizers.  The  media  were  hostile.  Money  dominated  politics.  But  many  of  those  demands  became  the  law  of  the  land  over  the years and made our country better.  So  it  is  today.  This  is  the  new  economy. It is an emerging global economy.  What  we  were  saying  is  we  want  to  civilize  the  global  economy  and  make  it  work\u2014not  just  the  large  conglomerates.  We  want  this  new  global  economy  to  work  for  the  environment;  to  work  for  family  farmers and producers;  to  work  for  human  rights;  to  work  for  religious  freedom; to work  for workers.  That  is  what  this  debate  has  been  about.  Senyou,  Mr.  Was  that  calfor  6  Presiminutes.  BAUCUS,  MOYNIHAN.  I  think  this  will  become  where  you  stand  in  relation  to  this  new  global  economy.  I  think  it  can  become  some  kind  of  axis  of  American  politics  over  the  next  5,  6,  7,  8,  or  9  years  to  come.  I  am  proud  to  stand  for  human  rights.  I  am  proud  to  stand  for  religious  freedom.  I  am  proud  to  stand  for  the  right  of  people  to  organize.  I  am  proud  to  stand  for  an  international  economy but an international economy  that is based upon some standard of decency and fairness.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Nevada.  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of  the  leader,  Senator DASCHLE,  I  yield  30  minutes  to Senator BYRD,  5 minutes  to  Senator  and  15  minutes  to  Senator  I  say  to  my  Democratic  colleagues,  that  is  all  the  time  we  have.  Senators  shouldn\u2019t  ask  for  an  extension  of  time  because  there  is  no  more time on the Democratic side.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  Senator from Illinois.  Mr.  DURBIN.  Thank  dent.  I  asked  culated?  Mr. REID. Yes. I understood that had  also been granted. If not, I grant 6 minutes.  Mr.  DURBIN.  Thank  you  very  much.  Mr. President, I rise today  in support  of  Permanent  Normal  Trade  Relations  with  China.  Today  the  United  States  Senate  will  vote  to  grant  PNTR  to  China and its 1.2 billion people. We will  decide  whether  or  not  to  allow  American  farmers,  manufacturers,  businessmen  and  women  to  trade  their  products,  their  ideas,  their  goods  with  one-  fifth of the world\u2019s population.  Last  November,  after  more  than  a  decade of negotiations,  the Clinton Administration  signed  a  bilateral  agreement  that  will  drastically  reduce  barriers  on  American  products  and  services  going  to  China.  The  agreement  is  clearly  in  the  best  interests  of  our  nation\u2019s  farmers,  manufacturers,  and  workers. Supporting China\u2019s entry  into  the WTO is clearly in the best interests  of  our  economy,  national  security  and  foreign policy.  Trade is the future. Make no mistake  about  it:  trade  can  open  up  the  exchange  of  ideas\u2014ideas  like  democracy,  freedom  of  speech,  freedom  to  worship,  and  freedom  of  association.  China  stands  on  the  brink  of  becoming  the  most  important  trading  partner  the  U.S.  has  ever  seen  and  the  U.S.  Senate  will  go  on  record  in  support  of  this  important  step  in  international  trade and  foreign policy.  When  China  concludes  similar  agreements with other countries, it will join  the WTO.  For  us  to  benefit  though,  we  must  grant  China  PNTR  status\u2014the  same  status  we  have  given  other  countries  in  the  WTO.  And,  Mr.  President,  that\u2019s what this debate  is about. Do we  give China the same status as the other  countries  already  in  the  WTO?  Do  we  put  them  in  an  environment  where  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:26 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S19SE0.REC S19SE0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",

As far as this Senator\u2019s vote is concerned, it will wait.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Chair  recognizes  the  Senator  from  orado.  Mr.  ALLARD.  Mr.  President,  I  sat  here  and  listened  to  my  good  friend  from  West  Virginia  on  trade.  I  believe  I  should  speak  from  a  position  of  representing  a  State  that  has  benefited  immensely  from  the  trade  agreements  that  we  have  passed  recently\u2014the  North American Free Trade Agreement  and  the  General  Agreement  on  Trade  and Tariffs.  Exports  from  the  State  of  Colorado,  which  I  represent,  have  increased  dramatically.  In  fact, we have experienced  the  greatest  growth  in  exports  of  any  State  in  the  Nation  on  a  percentage  basis. The economy of the State of Colorado  is  based  greatly  on  agriculture.  My  friend  from  West  Virginia  talked  about  agriculture  to  a  certain  degree.  We  grow  a  lot  of  wheat.  We  raise  a  lot  of  livestock,  and  we  do  make  an  attempt  to  expand  our  markets  to  the  Pacific  rim  countries,  which  includes  China.  We  have  a  very  modern  economic  base  in the State. We work a  lot on exporting  high  tech.  Many  high-tech  companies  do  business  in  the  State  of  Colorado.  On  a  concentration  basis,  we  have the highest concentration of high-  tech  employees  of  any  State  in  the  country.  So  we  benefit  from  exporting  goods,  and  the  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement  has  helped  the  State  of Colorado, and GATT has also.  I  happen  to  think  that  an  agreement  with  China  for  normal  trade  relations  will  help  agriculture,  and  it  will  help  States  such  as  Colorado  because  these  are markets where we can compete and  have been competing.  My  colleague  from  West  Virginia  talked  a  considerable  amount  about  the  trade  deficits  we  are  experiencing  in  this  country.  I  come  at  the  trade  deficit  issue  from  a  different  perspective  than my  colleague  from West  Virginia.  I  have  looked  at  what  happened  historically  with  trade  deficits.  If  we  look  at  the  time  of  the  Great  Depression  in  this  country,  the  trade  deficits  were  low.  If  we  look  at  the  time  when  we  were  suffering,  when  we  had  the  misery  index\u2014and  this  is  at  the  latter  part  of  the  1970s,  during  the  Carter  administration\u2014the  trade  deficit  was  low.  We  had  high  double-digit  unemployment. We had high  double-digit  inflation,  and  we  had  high  double-digit  unemployment.  But  our  trade  deficit  was  low.  I  happen  to  believe  when  we  look  at  the  trade  deficit,  it  is  more  of  a  reflection  of  what  is  happening  economically  in this country. Our country  has  experienced  high  trade  deficits  when our economy has been doing well,  just  like  during  the  period  of  time  we  are in today.  So  the  figures  he  presents  to  you  on  trade  deficits,  in  reality,  they  do  happen.  What  is  the  significance  to  the  economy? I happen to believe it has the  opposite  impact.  Many  times,  when  people are evaluating the impact of the  trade  deficit,  they  look  at  it  only  from  the  perspective  of  one  industry.  If  you  look  at  the  total  economy,  the  total  growth  of  jobs  within  this  country,  we  benefit,  in  many  cases,  by  importing  products.  How  does  that  work?  Let\u2019s  take  an  automobile,  for  example.  Some  State  may have a company\u2014maybe  in Michigan,  for  example\u2014that  could  be  impacted  by  trade  policies.  But  does  that  have a net impact on jobs in the United  States?  Many  times,  when  you  take  it  into  total  consideration,  there  is  a  net  gain  because  there  are  jobs\u2014union  jobs\u2014created  when  you  have  to  unload  those  cars  at  our  ports.  There  are  jobs  created  when  you  have  to  clean  up  the  cars  when  they  come  into  the  country.  There  are  jobs  created  when  you  have  to  transport  those  cars  across  the  country  to  get  them  to  a  point  of  sale.  Somebody has to sell the cars. Jobs are  created  there.  Somebody  has  to  buy  the  cars.  There  is  insurance  sold  in  relation to the purchase of the car. Goods  and  services  relating  to  that  go  into  the marketplace. Those cars have to be  maintained  and  operated  and  fixed.  Many times, they go  into a resale market at some point in their lifetime.  These are all  jobs  that are  created as  a  result  of  having  imported  that  product.  So  I  am  convinced  that  our  best  policy is to work in a free market environment,  and  the  problem  we  have  right  now  is  not  that  we  don\u2019t  place  a  lot  of  the  tariffs  and  restrictions  on  Chinese  goods  coming  into  this  country,  but  China  is  the  one  that  is  placing restrictions on our goods going into  their  country\u2014particularly  agricultural products and goods  related to  the  high-tech industry. That is why I think  this  particular  effort  to  create  normal  trade  relations  is  beneficial.  Isolationism doesn\u2019t work. Isolating a country  and  saying  that  is  going  to  help  human  rights\u2014I  don\u2019t  think  that  works. That  is one  reason why Taiwan,  for example, supports our efforts to try  to  establish  permanent  normal  trade  relations with China.  So  I  think  that  in  order  to  prevent  human  abuse,  to  protect human  rights,  we  need  to  open  up  China.  When  our  business  people  go  into  China,  they  expect  a  certain  standard.  They  just  won\u2019t  do  business  with  Chinese  companies without those standards. They will  have  to  abide  by  their  contracts.  If  somebody  doesn\u2019t  honor  the  contract,  there  has  to  be  a  court  system  of  some  type  that  will  help  enforce  those  contracts.  And  these  all  carry  with  them  democratic principles.  When  Chinese  businessmen  interact  with  American  businessmen,  they  will  understand how the free enterprise system  works,  how  democracy  works.  I  think  we  export  democracy  when  we  enter  into  a  free  market  agreement  where we  take  down  trade  barriers  and  increase  the  interaction  between  countries\u2014particularly when we are talking  about  a  democratic  county  as  opposed  to  a  Communist  one.  They  see  there  is  a  different  way  of  doing  things  and  prospering  that  yields  benefits  far  and  above  what  they  have  been  told  in  a  country  where  the  leaders  restrict  information and restrict freedoms.  I  think  it  is  important  we  pass  this  piece  of  legislation  that  says  we  will  have permanent normal trade relations  with China.  I  see  my  colleague  lina.  Mr.  BYRD.  Mr.  Senator yield?  Mr.  ALLARD.  I  would  be  glad  to  yield  to  the  Senator  from  West  Virginia.  But  I  also  know  that  I  have  a  colleague  from  North  Carolina  who  would  like  to  be  recognized  for  some  comments.  I  yield  to  my  colleague  from West Virginia.  Mr.  BYRD.  The  Senator  mentioned  my name. That is why I am asking him  to yield.  I  appreciate  the  fact  that  he  has  given  us  his  viewpoint.  My  remarks  were largely based on research that has  been  done  by  the  Economic  Policy  Institute. It is dated November 1999. I am  reading  from  a  paper  issued  by  the  institute. It is headed with these words:  President,  from  North  Carowill  the  NAFTA\u2019s pain deepens. Job destruction accelerates  from  1999  with  losses  in  every  State.  It  shows  Colorado  as  having  a  net  NAFTA  job  loss  of  3,625  jobs.  It  doesn\u2019t  show as much  for West Virginia as Colorado. West  Virginia  has  a  net  NAFTA  loss of 1,183 jobs.  Let  me  say  this  to  the  Senator.  I  have  been  in  Congress  now  48  years.  I  have  seen  Democratic  administrations,  and I have seen Republican administrations.  The  kind  of  talk  we  just  heard  from  this  Senator\u2014I  respect  him  as  a  colleague, but I have to say this\u2014is the  same  kind  of  talk  I  have  been  hearing  from  these  administrations  for  48  years.  That  is  State  Department  talk.  It  is  the  same  old  State  Department  talk.  I  will  say  to  this  Senator,  we  are  going  to  get  taken  to  the  cleaners.  We  have  been  taken  to  the  cleaners  all  these  48  years  by  other  countries.  In  these  ventured  agreements,  our  negotiators for some reason or other always  come  out  second.  We  have  been  taken  to the cleaners. We will be taken again.  The  Senator  stated  his  opinion.  That  is  this  Senator\u2019s  opinion,  and  it  is  based  on  48  years  of  hearing  this  same  line that emanates from\u2014\u2014  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

            "174": "S8692  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE September 19, 2000  eighteen  months,  is  disturbing.  But  I  do  not  believe  that  a  China-specific  sanctions  bill  is  an  effective  response  to  the  challenge  of  weapons  proliferation.  And  we  should  not  scuttle  PNTR  just  to  make  a  point\u2014however  valid\u2014  about  China\u2019s  continuing  export  of  missile-related technology.  Our concern about recent Chinese activities  related  to  the  transfer  of  missile  technology  should  not  lead  us  to  overlook  the  totality  of  China\u2019s  performance in the arms control area. The  fact  is  China  has  taken  steps,  particularly  in  the  last  decade,  to  bring  its  nonproliferation  and  arms  export  control  policies  more  in  line  with  international  norms.  China  acceded  to  the  Biological Weapons Convention  in  1984.  In  1992,  China  acceded  to  the  Nonproliferation  Treaty,  NPT.  China  signed  the  Comprehensive  Test  Ban  Treaty  in  1996,  CTBT,  and  the  next  year  promulgated  new  nuclear  export  controls  identical  to  the  dual-use  list  used  by  the  Nuclear  Suppliers  Group.  In  1997  China  joined  the  Zangger  Committee,  which  coordinates  nuclear  export policies among NPT members. The  same  year  it  ratified  the  Chemical  Weapons  Convention  and  began  to  enforce export controls on dual-use chemical  technology.  In  1998  China  published detail export control regulations  for  dual-use  nuclear  items.  These  developments  have  also  been  accompanied  by  various  pledges,  for  example  not to export complete missile systems  falling within MTCR payload and range  and  not  to  provide  assistance  to  Iran\u2019s  nuclear  energy  program.  China\u2019s  commitment  to  these  pledges  has  been  spotty  but  the  fact  is,  China\u2019s  record  today  is  dramatically  different  from  what  it  was  in  the  1980s  or  the  three  decades  before.  Then  we  were  faced  with  a  China  exporting  a  broad  range  of  military  technology  to  an  array  of  would-be  nuclear  states  including  Libya,  Syria,  Iran,  Iraq,  Pakistan  and  North Korea. Today,  our  principal  concern  is  Chinese  exports  in  the  area  of  missile-related  technology\u2014not  complete  missile  systems\u2014and  to  two  countries:  Pakistan  and  Iran.  That,  it  seems  to  me,  is  progress,  and  progress  made  during  a  period  of  growing  engagement between China and the international community.  Some  in  this  body,  frustrated  that  our  current  engagement  with  China  has  born  little  fruit,  are  offering  amendments  in  an  attempt  to  use  the  presumed leverage in PNTR as a means  of  changing  China\u2019s  policies.  I  believe  that  engagement  offers  the  best  prospects  for  promoting  our  interests  with  China  but  I  understand  and  share  their  frustration  over  the  way  in  which  the  current  administration  has  engaged  China.  The  next  administration  must  engage with greater clarity of message,  consistency  of  policy,  pragmatism  about  what  can  be  achieved  and  over  what time  frame, and determination to  hold  China  accountable  when  it  misbehaves or ignores commitments made.  However,  we  should  not  let  our  frustration  with  the  benefits  of  engagement  lead  us  to  undermine  that  policy  by delaying or denying PNTR  in a vain  quest  to  change  China  overnight.  PNTR  is  not  a  \u2018\u2018reward\u2019\u2019,  as  the  opponents  of PNTR  suggest.  It  is  a key  element in our economic engagement with  China  and  an  affirmation  of  our  intention to have a normal trading relationship  with  China,  as  we  do  with  the  overwhelming  majority  of  our  other  trading partners. Many of China\u2019s most  outspoken  critics  including  Martin  Lee,  the  head  of  Hong  Kong\u2019s  Democratic  Party,  Bao  Tong,  one  of  China\u2019s  most  prominent  dissidents;  and  Dai  Qing,  an  engaging  writer  and  environmental  activist  who  was  jailed  in  the  wake of Tiananmen Square for her pro-  democracy  activities  and  writings,  want  us  to  give  PNTR  to  China.  They  want  it  because  they  know  that  drawing China deeper into the international  community\u2019s  institutions  and  norms  will  promote  more  change  in  China  over  time.  As  Dai  Qing  told  U.S.  when  she  testified  before  the  Foreign  Relations  Committee  in  July:  \u2018\u2018Firstly,  PNTR  will  help  to  reduce  governmental  control  over  economy  and  society;  secondly,  PNTR  will  help  to  promote  the  rule  of  law;  and  thirdly,  PNTR will help  to nourish  independent  political and social forces in China.\u2019\u2019  The  opponents  of  PNTR  have  argued  that  we  are  giving  up  leverage  over  China  because  we  are  abandoning  our  annual  review  of  U.S.-China  relations.  This  argument  ignores  two  critical  points: first, there has been little leverage  in  the  MFN  review  because  China  can  simply  do  business  with  others;  and second, Congress has never revoked  the  status  in  the  last  12  years.  So  how  meaningful  is  this  review  in  reality?  There  is  nothing  in  the  action  we  are  contemplating  here  that  prevents  Congress  from  acting  in  the  future,  if  it  so  desires.  In  fact,  the  pending  legislation  sets up a commission to review China\u2019s  performance  on  key  issues  including  human  rights  and  labor  rights  and  trade  compliance  so  that  if  Congress  wants  to  act,  we  will  be  better  informed at the outset.  This vote on extending PNTR is not a  referendum on the China of  today.  It  is  a  vote  on  how  best  to  pursue  all  of  our  interests with China  including our  economic  interests.  Extending  PNTR  will  allow  the  United  States  to  enjoy  economic  benefits  stemming  from  the  bilateral  agreement  negotiated  between  the United States and China.  I am concerned  that  critical  labor,  human  rights  and  environmental  protections  were  left  out  of  the  agreement.  However,  I  believe  the  agreement  undeniably  forces  China  to  open  its  doors  to  more  trade,  and  if  we  fail  to  vote  in  favor  of  PNTR,  we  risk  forfeiting  increased  trade  with  the  largest  emerging market  in  the world  to  other  countries in Europe and Asia.  This  would  be  no  small  loss  for  the  United  States.  Just  consider  the  facts  which  underscore  the  importance  of  trade  with  China.  By  granting  PNTR  status to China, the U.S. will be able to  avail  itself  to  China\u2014to  make  American  goods  and  services  available  to  one-fifth  of  the  world\u2019s  population.  China  is  the  world\u2019s  second  largest  economy  in  terms  of  domestic  purchasing power. It is the world\u2019s seventh  largest  economy  in  terms  of  Gross  Domestic  Product  and  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  economies  in  the  world.  Simply  put, China\u2019s  economy  is  simply  too large to ignore.  It  is  of  course  true  that  there  has  been  sharp  growth  in  the  U.S.  trade  deficit  with  China,  which  surged  from  $6.2 billion  in  1989 to more than $68 billion  in 1999. But  it  is also true that the  deficit  is  in  large  part  due  to  the  fact  that  China  has  closed  its  doors  to  U.S.  products.  I believe that only by granting PNTR  to China will U.S. businesses be able to  open  those  doors  and  export  goods  and  services  to China,  so  that  our  economy  can  continue  to  grow  and  our  workers  be  fully  employed.  U.S.  exports  to  China  and  Hong  Kong  now  support  400,000  American  jobs.  Trade  with  China  is  of  increasing  importance  in  my  home  state.  China  is  Massachusetts\u2019  eighth  largest  export  market.  The Massachusetts  Institute  for  Social  and  Economic  Research  at  the  University  of  Massachusetts  calculated  that  in  1999,  Massachusetts  exported  goods  worth  a  total  of  nearly  $366  million  to  China.  That  represents  an  increase  in  total  exports  to  China  of  more  than  15  percent  from  the  previous  year  and  translates  into more  jobs and a  stronger economy in my state.  The  bilateral  trade  agreement  between  the  U.S.  and  China  will  give  businesses  in  every  state  the  chance  to  increase  their  exports  to  China,  ultimately  leading  to more  growth  here  at  home.  Under  the  agreement,  China  is  committed  to  reducing  tariffs  and  removing non-tariff barriers in many sectors  important  to  the  U.S.  economy.  China  has  agreed,  for  instance,  to  cut  overall agricultural  tariffs  for U.S. priority  products\u2014beef,  grapes,  wine,  cheese,  poultry,  and  pork\u2014from  31.5  percent  to  14.5  percent  by  2004.  Overall  industrial tariffs will fall from an average  of  24.6  percent  to  9.4  percent  by  2005. Tariffs on  information  technology  products\u2014which  have  been  driving  the  tremendous  economic  prosperity  our  country  is  currently  enjoying\u2014would  be reduced from an average level of 13.3  percent  to  zero  by  the  year  2005.  China  must  also  phase  out  quotas  within  five  years.  The  U.S.  market,  on  the  other  hand,  is  already  open  to  Chinese  products.  We  have  conceded  nothing  to  China  in  terms  of market  access, while  China  must  now  open  its  doors  to  increased  exports.  This  is  a  one-way  trade  agreement  favoring  the  United  States of America.  China  has  made  other  concessions  that  are  likely  to  be  extremely  beneficial  to  the  U.S.  economy.  It  has  agreed  to  open  service  sectors,  such  as  distribution,  telecommunications,  insurance,  banking,  securities,  and  professional  services  to  foreign  firms.

            "182": "S8700  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE September 19, 2000  I  will  vote  for  PNTR  not  because  I  am  comfortable  with  the  thought  that  China  will  adhere  to  all  the  details  in  the  bilateral  agreement,  or  the  prospect  that  they will  become  exceptional  trading  partners  overnight,  but  I  support the men and women from the most  trade  dependent  state  in  the  nation  who  have  urged  its  successful  passage.  Whatever  the  course  of  our  relationship  with  China  takes  over  the  coming  years,  I  assure  Washingtonians  that  I  will  be  scrutinizing  the  reactions  of  Beijing  very  closely.  I  will  continue  to  engage in a dialogue with all interested  parties  to  ensure  that Washington benefits  from  these  new  trade  practices.  I  will  work  to  ensure  that  American  interests  and  national  security  weigh  heavy  on  the  minds  of  our  negotiators  and  the  next  Administration.  Because  this  vote  is  unmistakably  one  of  the  most significant trade votes the Senate  has  cast  in  recent  years,  I  assure  my  constituents  that  I  will  keep  their  interests at heart.  Whatever it takes.  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President,  I have  decided to vote in favor of China PNTR  because  I  believe  this  action  will  continue  our  policy  of  engagement  with  the  Chinese  government  and  increase  the  likelihood  that  our  nation  will  have better relations with China  in the  years to come. The other option was to  act  on  the  assumption  that  China  will  become  more  hostile  to  the  United  States  and  that  we  must  try  to  seal  it  off, which will not work.  This  decision  is  a  further  step  down  the  road  that  was  begun  by  President  Nixon  in  1972 when he  concluded  it was  better  to  have  relations  with  China  than  to  shut  it  off.  Since  then  there  have been many difficulties, but on the  whole,  I  believe  the  relationship  has  been  better  than  it  would  have  been  otherwise.  We  now  maintain  military  superiority  over  China  and  it  is  critical  that  it  continue.  I  do  not  believe  that  it  is  inevitable  that  our  future  will  be  shaped by hostile  relations with China.  If we are strong and maintain our military,  the  chance  of  avoiding  potential  future  hostilities  will  be  improved.  Such a vision is what wise leadership is  all about.  I am not certain how best to  improve  the  conditions  of  Christians  and  other  religious  people  in  China.  I  do  recall,  however,  that  when  Rome  changed  from  persecuting  the  early  Christians  to  making  Christianity  the  official  religion  of  the  empire,  the  change  came  about  because  of  a  change  of  heart  and  not as a result of a threat  from an outside military power.  I  was  very  impressed  with  the  testimony  of  Ned  Graham,  son  of  the  Rev.  Billy  Graham,  who  aids  Christians  in  China  and  who  has  visited  the  country  over  forty  times  and  distributed  over  two million Bibles  to  unlicensed Christians. He testified before the Senate Finance Committee. In his summation he  stated  that  a  vote  for  PNTR  would  encourage  China\u2019s  engagement  with  the  world, increase the availability of computer  technology  to  its  citizens,  accelerate  its  development  of  a  rule  of  law,  allow  for  increased  contact  between  U.S.  and  Chinese  citizens,  and  ultimately  lead  to  positive  changes  in  its  religious  policy.  He  concluded  that  most  importantly  \u2018\u2018this  action  will  help  diminish  the  negative  perceptions  that  exist  between  our  two  great  countries.\u2019\u2019 While we,  as  humans,  can  never  know the  future, I am persuaded by his  remarks.  Generosity  of  spirit  and  forbearance  founded  on  strength  are  the  qualities of a great nation.  On  the  level  of  trade,  I  believe  that  my  state  of  Alabama  will  be  able  to  sell  more  products  in  China  because  of  the significant reductions  in the tariffs  China  has  imposed  on  imported  American  goods.  This  increased  trade  will  benefit  Alabama\u2019s  farmers,  timber  industry and much of our manufacturing.  It  can  benefit  our  transportation  system, including the Port of Mobile.  While  I  think  it  will  increase  our  exports,  I  cannot  conclude  that  this  agreement  is  going  to  help  our  overall  balance  of  trade  deficit,  at  least  not  in  the  short  run.  While  China  has  a  significant  wage  advantage  in  its  manufacturing,  it  has  a  shortage  of  many  natural  resources,  lacks  technology,  has  a  very  poor  infrastructure  and  is  burdened  by  corruption  and  a  lack  of  a  rule of law which protects liberties and  property  interests.  In  addition,  it  continues  to  hold  on  to  the  form  of  communism,  an  ideology  of  incalculable  destructive  power.  These  problems will  burden them for years to come and will  take many generations to eliminate.  The  key  to  the  success  of  this  agreement  will  be  vigorous,  determined  and  sustained  leadership  by  the  United  States  to  ensure  that  China  complies  with  this  agreement  and  the  WTO  rules. China\u2019s tendency has been  to cut  corners  and  not  live  up  to  its  obligations  under  agreements.  In  my  view,  China  must  come  to  see  that  its  interests  and  those  of  its  trading  partners  will  be  advanced  by  following  these  trading  rules.  Unfortunately,  China  seems  to  be  obsessed  with  exporting  and  not  importing.  The  truth  is  China  and her people will benefit from having  the  opportunity  to  buy  quality  food  and  products  from  around  the  world.  They must come to recognize that fact.  This issue is very complex and no one  can  see  into  the  future  with  a  crystal  ball,  but  my  analysis  and  judgement  tells me it is time to step out in a positive way, and to take the lead in reducing  some  of  the  suspicions  and  misperceptions  that  have  grown  in  recent years between our two nations.  Since  I  believe  that  increased  economic  activity  between  our  two  countries  is  not  likely  to  assist  China  in  strengthening  its  military  in  any  substantial  way,  regardless  of  legislation,  I  see  the  positive  aspects  of  this  legislation  outweighing  the  negative.  We  must,  however,  make  clear  to  China  that we intend to defend our just interests  and  those  of  our  allies  around  the  FRED THOMPSON world,  and  that  we  will  not  abandon  our ally and friend, the Democratically  elected  government  of Taiwan. We  also  need  to  remain  especially  vigilant  to  protect  our  military  secrets  and  technological  advantage.  I  was  therefore  disappointed  that  the  amendment  offered  by  Senator  did  not  pass.  We  must  make  crystal  clear  to  our  business  community  that  we  will  not  tolerate  transfer  of  our  military  technology  to  China.  While  I  favored  a  number  of  the  amendments  that  have  been  offered  to  this  legislation, and was disappointed they did not  pass,  I  am  appreciative  of  the  quality  of  the  debate  that  has  surrounded  this  issue.  China has 1.2 billion people, the most  populous  country  on  this  globe.  Their  people  are  talented  and  hardworking.  Our vote today should enhance our economic and political relationships.  Mr.  EDWARDS.  Mr.  President  I  rise  today  in  support  of  H.R.  4444,  which  would  grant  Permanent  Normal  Trade  Relations  to  China.  I  do  so  only  after  long  and  careful  consideration  of  this  proposal.  I  believe  that  granting  permanent  normal  trade  relations  with  China  is  the  right  thing  to  do.  It  will  significantly alter our nation\u2019s relations with  China.  Trade  between  U.S.  companies  and  the  Chinese  will  likely  explode  in  the  coming  years\u2014generating  jobs  and  revenues  in  this  country.  It  could  easily  be  the  keystone  in  the  continuing  prosperity  of  this  nation.  And  it  could  be the vital catalyst for democracy and  a free-market system in China.  During  the  last  few months  as  I  have  traveled  through  North  Carolina  and  met with my constituents, I have heard  from  hundreds  of  men  and  women  who  believe that their future prosperity and  their  jobs  turn upon  this vote. Many of  them eagerly support this legislation.  I believe that North Carolina workers  can compete with anyone and win. This  bill  opens  a  world  of  opportunity  to  North Carolina businesses and workers.  The  farmer,  the  high-  tech  worker,  the  furniture  manufacturer,  the  factory  worker,  and  the  banker  all  will  get  a  real  chance  to  capture  a  part  of  the  Chinese market.  The  farmer  who  is  working  so  hard  and  struggling  believes  that  China\u2019s  agricultural  market  will  be  opened.  For  example,  China  already  imports  12  percent  of  its  poultry  meat.  If  China  joins  the  WTO,  it  will  cut  its  poultry  tariffs  in  half  and  accept  all  poultry  meat  that  is  certified  wholesome  by  the  USDA.  A  similar  situation  holds  for  pork  and  tobacco  products.  China\u2019s  agreement to lower its tariffs, to eliminate quotas, and to defer to U.S. health  standards  provides  North  Carolina  farmers with real opportunity.  The  high-  tech  worker  who  is  producing  software  or  fiber  optics  cable  will  also  benefit.  China  has  agreed  to  eliminate  its  duties  on  these  products  in the next few years and has agreed to  eliminate many of its purchase and distribution  rules  that  inhibit  sales  of  U.S. products.

            "190": "S8708  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE September 19, 2000  Mr.  President,  my  concerns  about  China are longstanding. They are based  in  no  way  on  antipathy  for  the  people  of  China,  but  rather  China\u2019s  authoritarian government\u2014a government with  a  human  rights  track  record  that  no  one  in  good  conscience  could  even  defend. That  is why  I  opposed  the  annual  renewal  of  normal  trade  relations  for  China just last year.  At  the  same  time,  we  are  faced  with  another  irrefutable  fact\u2014China  is  becoming a member of  the global  trading  community  with  or  without  the  concurrence of the United States. The fundamental  question we  are  faced with  is  whether  the  U.S.  will  be  fully  engaged  with China during this process.  A  vote  in  favor  of  PNTR  for  China  represents  a  recognition  of  reality,  a  recognition  that  China  currently  has  complete  access  to  our  market  while  we have very limited access to theirs, a  recognition  that  China  is  about  to  burst  on  to  the  international  trading  scene  as  a  full  fledged  member  of  the  World  Trade  Organization,  a  recognition  that  we  would  be  actively  choosing  to  put  ourselves  at  a  distinct  disadvantage  relative  to  our  fellow  WTO  members  should we  fail  to  grant  China  PNTR.  A  \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019  vote  is  a  recognition  that  our  success  in  the  new  century\u2019s  new  global  economy\u2014which  has  arrived  whether  we  care  to  admit  it  or  not\u2014  will only be as great as our willingness  to be a part of it, a recognition that we  have,  rightly  or  wrongly\u2014and  I  would  argue  wrongly\u2014already  de-linked  our  trade  policy  with  China  from  our  human  rights  policy,  and  a  recognition  that  the  status  quo  has  done  little  or  nothing  to  help  improve  the  lot  of  the  typical Chinese man or woman.  Mr.  President,  this  is  an  imperfect  bill  we  have  before  us.  Personally,  I  would  have  preferred  to  support  a  bill  improved  by  a  number  of  amendments  we  have  considered  during  our  debate.  Because  I  believe  we  must  do  our  utmost  to  impact  human  rights  in  china,  to protect against the potential impact  of their massive cheap labor market, to  preserve  our  national  security  and  to  ensure  compliance  with  our  trade  agreements.  For  instance,  as  my  colleague,  Senator  stated  on  the  floor  during  the  debate  on  his  amendment  conditioning  PNTR  on  China\u2019s  compliance  with  previous  U.S.-China  prison  labor  agreements,  the  1992  agreement  allowed  on-site  inspections  by  U.S.  Customs  officials  in  China  to  determine  whether  allegations  that  forced  or  prison  labor  were  manufacturing  products were true.  Yet  as  soon  as  Taiwan\u2019s  then-President  Lee  visited  his  alma  mater,  Cornell  University,  In  1992,  China  demonstrated  its  displeasure  with  the  U.S.  by  among  other  things,  suspending  its  agreement  to  allow  U.S.  inspections.  China  still  refuses  to  abide  by  the  terms of this agreement.  That\u2019s  why  I  supported  Senator  amendment  because  I  beWELLSTONE\u2019s  WELLSTONE,  lieve it is time for China to start living  up  to  the  international  economic  role  it  seeks. Even  absent  that  amendment,  under  the  WTO,  China  is  expected  to  abide  by  all  trade  agreements  all  the  time\u2014not  just when  it  is  in  its best  interest.  And  I  will  be  looking  to  the  WTO to hold them to that standard.  Indeed,  as  a  WTO  member,  China  would  be  subject  to  reams  of  trade  rules,  and  any  of  the  organization\u2019s  138  members  would  demand  that  a  rule  be  enforced.  I  believe  that  this  perhaps,  more  than  anything  else,  would  spur  the  development  of  a  market  economy  in  china  which  is  based  on  full  compliance with its trade agreements.  Moreover,  it  is  encouraging  that  the  Administration  has  put  forth  a  plan  to  monitor  China\u2019s  compliance  with  the  establishment  of  a  new  Commerce  Department  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  China,  who  would  be  devoted  to  monitoring  and  enforcing  China\u2019s WTO  trade  agreements.  I  am  also  encouraged  by  announcements  that  a  \u2018\u2018rapid-  response  compliance\u2019\u2019  team  of  12  staff  people  working  in  the  U.S.  and  China,  and  a  China-specific  subsidy  enforcement  team, will be established  to monitor China\u2019s trade compliance.  Further,  Mr.  President,  the  legislation  itself  requires  an  annual  report  from  the  USTR  on  Chinese  compliance  with WTO obligations and instructs the  USTR  to work  to  create  a multilateral  mechanism  at  the  WTO  to  measure  compliance.  It  also  authorizes  funding  deemed  necessary  for  the  U.S.  to  monitor  China\u2019s  compliance.  This  is  a  step  in  the  right  direction  and  a  necessary  component of this bill.  Another  issue  of  utmost  importance  as  we  have  reviewed  PNTR  from  the  perspective of what is in the best interests  of  the  United  States  is  our  ability  to maintain our national security.  As my colleagues are well aware, one  of  a  president\u2019s  primary  responsibilities  under  the  Constitution  is  to  conduct  foreign  affairs,  and  in  doing  so,  Americans  assume  that  a  president  is  promoting  our  national  security  and  interests  abroad.  As  trade  among  nations  is  inexorably  intertwined  with  political  relations  among  nations,  national  security  cannot\u2014and  should  not\u2014be  considered  in  isolation.  Therefore,  it  has  been  entirely  appropriate  that  China\u2019s  proliferation  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction  have  been  part  of  this debate.  I  have  long  been  concerned  about  transfers  of  technology  by  China  that  contribute to the proliferation of weapons  of  mass  destruction  or  missiles  that  could  deliver  them.  Recent  issues  have  involved  China\u2019s  sales  to  Pakistan,  Iran, North Korea,  and  Libya.  On  August  9,  the  CIA  reported  that  China  remained  a  \u2018\u2018key  supplier\u2019\u2019  of  weapons  technology  and  increased  missile-related assistance to Pakistan in the second half of 1999.  This  is  why  I  was  a  cosponsor  of  the  Thompson-Torricelli  bill  and  a  supporter  of  their  amendment.  It  is  vital  that  the  U.S.  demonstrates  that  we  will  not  turn  a  blind  eye  to  China\u2019s  proliferation  and  that  we  will  actively  take steps to induce change.  The Thompson-Torricelli  amendment  did  not  address  trade  but,  in  fact,  was  a  crucial  part  of  this  debate  as  China  continues  to  facilitate  the  proliferation of missile technology and weapons  of  mass  destruction,  to  rogue  countries. It would have provided an annual  review  mechanism,  mandatory  penalties,  and  an  escalating  scale  of  responses  to  Chinese  proliferation  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  missile  technologies,  and  advanced  conventional weapons.  Accordingly,  I  consider  the  passage  and  enactment  of  the  Thompson-  Torricelli  proposal  in  the  future  not  simply  to be good policy, but a  critical  companion to PNTR, and I hope we will  revisit  this  critical  issue  in  the  107th  Congress.  Mr.  President,  in  addition  to  an  in  concert  with  our  national  security  responsibilities,  one  of  the  most  prominent  national  interests  of  the  U.S.  is  the  promotion  of  human  rights  around  the  world.  Indeed,  one  of  the  ongoing  and  essential  reasons  I  have  voted  against  NTR  status  for  China  in  the  past  was  due  to  its  infamous  human  rights abuses.  During  the  consideration  by  the  House,  provisions  were  added  to  the  PNTR  legislation  to  monitor  China\u2019s  human  rights  by  creating  a  Congressional-Executive  Commission.  The  Commission  will  submit  to  Congress  and  the  President  an  annual  report  of  its  findings,  including  as  appropriate  WTO-consistent  recommendations  for  legislative or executive action.  I  also  recognize  that  any  U.S.  trade  sanction  taken  against  China  could  be  brought  before  the  WTO  for  resolution  by  China.  The  WTO\u2019s  focus  is  international trade law, not human rights.  Accordingly,  I  supported  Senator  HELMS\u2019 amendment that would require,  as  a  condition  of  China  receiving  PNTR,  that  the  President  certify  that  China  has  taken  actions  regarding  its  human  rights  abuses  and  religious  persecution.  Just  as  importantly,  I  also  supported  another  Helms  amendment  that  called  on  U.S.  businesses  to  conduct  themselves  in  a  manner  that  reflects  the  basic  American  values  of  democracy,  individual  liberty  and  justice\u2014a voluntary code of conduct.  While  both  amendments  were  clearly  defeated  on  grounds  other  than  the  merits of the  issue  itself,  I make a personal appeal to America\u2019s businesses to  conduct  themselves  in  a  manner  that  does credit to the ideas we hold dear as  a nation.  And  I\u2019m  certain  my  colleagues  agree  that  it  is  clearly  in  America\u2019s  best  interest\u2014not  to mention  in keeping with  the  principles  on which we were  founded\u2014to keep up the pressure on China to  improve  human  rights  for  its  own  people  and  it  is  my  fervent  hope  that  we  will do so.

            "198": "S8716  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE September 19, 2000  An  objective  assessment  of  China  over  the  past  two  decades  reveals  sweeping  changes  in  almost  every  aspect of life\u2014changes facilitated and accelerated  by  China\u2019s  opening  to  the  world. These changes are not the result  of  our  annual  review  of  China\u2019s  trade  status. The roots of change reach much  deeper than that.  China\u2019s  leaders  have  consciously  undertaken\u2014for  their  own  reasons,  not  ours\u2014a  fundamental  transformation  of  the  communist  system  that  so  long  condemned  their  great  people  to  isolation,  poverty,  and  misery.  They  have  been  forced  to  acknowledge  the  failure  of  communism,  and  have  conceded  the  irrefutable  superiority  of  an  open market  economy.  The  result  has  been  a  marked  improvement  in  living  standards  for  hundreds  of million  of  Chinese  citizens.  This  growing  prosperity  for  the  Chinese  people,  in  turn,  has  put  China  on  a  path  toward  ever  greater  political  and  economic  freedom.  The  Chinese  people,  taking  responsibility  for  their  own  economic  livelihood,  are  demanding a greater voice in the governance of  China.  This is not just my analysis.  This  is  also  the  view  of  people  inside  and  outside  of  China  who  are  struggling  to  deepen  China\u2019s  reforms  and  to  extend them into the political arena.  Dai  Qing,  a  former  Chinese  rocket  scientist  turned  political  dissident  and  environmentalist,  testified  passionately  in  support  of  permanent  normal  trade  relations  before  the  Senate  Foreign Relations  Committee  in  July.  She  said,  \u2018\u2018PNTR  will  help  reduce  governmental  control  over  the  economy  and  society; it will help to promote the rule  of  law; and  it will help to nourish  independent  political  and  social  forces  in  China.\u2019\u2019  Wang  Dan,  the  Beijing  University  student  who  helped  lead  the  Tiananmen  Square  protests  and  now  lives  in  exile,  says,  \u2018\u2018Economic  change  does influence political change. China\u2019s  economic  development  will  be  good  for  the  East,  as  well  as  for  the  Chinese  people.\u2019\u2019  And  Xie  Wanjun,  the  Director  of  the  Overseas  Office  of  the  China  Democratic  Party\u2014a  party  banned  within  China\u2014says,  We  support  unconditional  PNTR  with  China  by  the  U.S.  government.  .  .  .  We  believe  the  closer  the  economic  relationship  between  the  United  States  and  China,  the  more chance  for the U.S. to politically  influence  China,  the  more  chances  to  monitor  human  rights  conditions  in  China,  and  the  more effective the U.S. will be to push China  to launch political reforms.  Martin  Lee,  Chairman  of  Hong  Kong\u2019s  Democratic  Party,  supports  China\u2019s  entry  into  the World Trade Organization  and  the  granting  of  permanent  normal  trade  relations.  \u2018\u2018The  participation  of  China  in  WTO  would  not  only  have  economic  and  political  benefits,  but  would  also  serve  to  bolster  those in China who understand that the  country  must  embrace  the  rule  of  law. . . .\u2019\u2019  And  Chen  Shui-Bian,  Taiwan\u2019s  democratically  elected  President,  said  last  spring,  We  feel  that  a  democratic  China  will  contribute  to  permanent  peace  in  this  region.  Therefore, we support U.S. efforts to improve  relations  with  China.  While  we  seek  to  normalize  the  cross-strait  relationship,  especially  in  the  area  of  business  and  trade,  we  are happy to see the United States and China  improve their economic relations. Therefore,  I  am  willing  to  support  the  U.S.  normalization of trade relations with the PRC.  RECORD It\u2019s  not  must  dissidents  and  leading  Chinese  democracy  advocates  who  support PNTR.  At  this  time,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  introduce  into  the  recent  statements  by  former  Presidents  Gerald Ford  and  Jimmy Carter,  former  Secretaries  of  State  Henry  Kissinger  and  James  Baker,  Chairman  of  the  Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Christian Broadcasting Network  Pat  Robertson,  former  National  Security  Advisory  Brent  Scowcroft,  and  yes,  even  former  President  of  the  United  Auto  Workers  and  former  U.S.  Ambassador  to  China  Leonard  Woodcock,  all  of  whom  support  extension  of  permanent  normal  trade  relations to China.  There  being  no  objection,  the  material  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows;  QUOTES IN SUPPORT OF PERMANENT NORMAL  TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA  Former  President  Gerald  Ford:  \u2018\u2018the  facts  are  a  negative  vote  in  the  House  and/or  the  Senate  would  be  catastrophic,  disastrous  to  American  agriculture;  electronics,  telecommunications,  autos  and  countless  other  products and services. A negative vote in the  Congress  would  greatly  assist  our  foreign  competitors  from  Europe  or  Asia  by  giving  them privileged access to China markets and  at  the  same  time,  exclude  America\u2019s  farm  and  factory  production  from  the  vast  Chinese  market.\u2019\u2019  [remarks  at  distinguished  Americans  in  Support  of  PNTR  event,  5/9/  2000]  Former  President  Jimmy  Carter:  \u2018\u2018China  still  has  not  measured  up  to  the  human  rights  and  democracy  standards  and  labor  standards  of  America.  But  there\u2019s  no  doubt  in  my  mind  that  a  negative  vote  on  this  issue  in  the  Congress  will  be  a  serious  setback  and  impediment  for  the  further  democratization,  freedom  and  human  rights  in  China.  That  should  be  the  major  consideration  for  the  Congress  and  the  nation. And  I  hope  the  members  of  Congress  will  vote  accordingly,  particularly  those  who  are  interested  in  human  rights,  as  I  am;  and  those  who are interested in the well-being of American  workers  as  I  am.\u2019\u2019  [remarks  at  Distinguished  Americans  in  Support  of  PNTR  event, 5/9/2000]  Alan  Greenspan,  Chairman  of  the  Federal  Reserve:  \u2018\u2018The  outcome  of  the  debate  on  permanent  normal  trade  relations  with  China  will  have  profound  implications  for  the  free  world\u2019s  trading  system  and  the  long-term  growth  potential  of  the  American  economy  . . .  The  addition  of  the  Chinese  economy  to  the  global marketplace will  result  in  a more  efficient  worldwide  allocation  of  resources  and  will  raise  standards  of  living  in  China  and  its  trading  partners  . . . As  China\u2019s  citizens  experience  economic  gains,  so  will  the  American  firms  that  trade  in  their  expanding  markets  . . .  Further  development  of  China\u2019s  trading  relationships  with  the  United  States  and  other  industrial  countries  will work to strengthen the rule of law within China and  to  firm  its commitment  to economic  reform  . . .  I  believe  extending  PNTR  to  China,  and  full  participation  by  China  in  the  WTO,  is  in  the  interests  of  the  United  States.\u2019\u2019  [press  statement  at  the  White  House,  5/18/2000,  including  quote  from  Greenspan  letter  to  House  of  Representatives  Banking  Committee  Chairman  James  Leach  released 5/8/2000]  Former  Secretary  of  State  Henry  Kissinger:  \u2018\u2018The  agreement  is,  of  course,  in  our  economic  interest,  since  its  grants  China  what  has  been  approved  by  the  Congress  every  year  for  20  years.  But  we  are  here  together not for economic reasons. We are here  because cooperative relations with China are  in  the  American  national  interest.  Every  President, for 30 years, has come to that conclusion.\u2019\u2019  [remarks  at  Distinguished  Americans in Support of PNTR event, 5/9/2000]  Former  Secretary  of  State  and  Treasury  James  Baker:  \u2018\u2018As  a  former  Secretary  of  Treasury and of State, I believe that normalized trade with China  is good  for America on  both economic grounds and security grounds.  It will  help move  China  in  the  direction  of  a  more open society, and in time, more responsive  government.  As  such,  normalized  trade  relations  with  China  will  advance  both  our  national  interests,  as  well  as  our  national  ideals, in our relations with the world\u2019s most  populous  country.\u2019\u2019  [remarks  at  Distinguished  Americans  in  Support  of  PNTR  event, 5/9/2000]  Pat Robertson, Chairman  of  the Board  and  CEO,  The  Christian  Broadcasting  Network,  Inc.: \u2018\u2018If the US refuses to grant normal trading  relations  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  and  if  we  significantly  curtail  the  broad-based  economic,  education,  social  and  religious  contacts  that  are  being  made  between  the  U.S.  and  China,  we  will  damage  ourselves  and  set  back  the  cause  of  those  in  China  who  are  struggling  toward  increased  freedom  for  their  fellow  citizens.\u2019\u2019  [letter  to  Congressman Joseph Pitts, 5/10/2000]  Brent  Scowcroft,  USAF  Lt.  Gen  (ret)  and  former  National  Security  Advisor:  \u2018\u2018I\u2019m  strongly  in  favor of granting permanent normal  trade  relations  to  China,  not  as  a  favor  to China, but because doing so would be very  much  in  the  U.S.  national  interest.  This,  in  my  judgment,  goes  far  beyond  American  business  and  economic  interests,  as  important  as  these  are,  to  key  U.S.  political  and  security  interests  . . .  This  may  be  one  of  those  rare  occasions  on  an  important  issue  where  there\u2019s  virtually  no  downside  to  taking  affirmative  action.  We  cannot  ourselves  determine  the  ultimate  course  China  will  take.  And  denying  permanent  normal  trade  relations  will  remove  none  of  the  blemishes  that  China\u2019s  opponents  have  identified.  But  we  can  take  steps  which  will  encourage  China  to  evolve  in  directions  compatible  with  U.S.  interests.  To  me,  granting  permanent  normal  trade  relations  is  one  of  the  most important such steps that Congress can  take.\u2019\u2019  [testimony  before  the  Senate  Commerce Committee, 4/11/2000]  Leonard Woodcock, former president of the  United  Auto  Workers  and  former  U.S.  Ambassador to China: \u2018\u2018I have spent much of my  life  in  the  labor movement  and  remain  deeply  loyal  to  its  goals.  But  in  this  instance,  I  think  our  labor  leaders  have  got  it  wrong  . . .  American  labor  has  a  tremendous  interest  in China\u2019s  trading  on  fair  terms with  the  Untied  States  . . .  The  agreement  we  signed  with  China  this  past  November  marks  the  largest single step ever taken toward achieving that goal.\u2019\u2019 [Washington Post, 3/8/2000]  Mr.  BIDEN.

First,  Mr.  President,  this  is  the  last  day  of  a  very  critical  and  helpful  staff  member  working  here  with  the  Senate  in  the  Finance  Committee. That person  is Debbie Lamb on  Senator MOYNIHAN\u2019s staff. She has been  his  chief  trade  counsel  and  has  been  very  helpful,  obviously,  to  Senator  and,  before  that,  to  Senator  MOYNIHAN Without  MOYNIHAN  Bentsen.  I  remember  specifically  one  night we  were  negotiating  the  final  contours  of  a  bill  between  the  House  and  the  Senate.  I  wound  up  relying  on  her  counsel  as  we  made  the  final  decisions.  People  may  find  it  somewhat  a  surprise  that  the  majority  leader,  a  Republican,  would  be  relying  on  the  counsel  on  the  other side of the aisle, but it does work  that  way  and  it  attests  to  her  credibility  and  expertise.  She  has  done  a  wonderful  job.  We  wish  her  the  very  best.  In  that  connection,  too,  I  want  to  recognize  the  outstanding  work  that  has  been  done  by  Senator  and  by Chairman ROTH. Here  he  is,  sitting  right  behind  me.  They  have  been  patient;  they  have  been  willing  to  spend  hours  here  in  the  Senate.  They  waited  weeks  to  get  their  opportunity  to  have  it  considered  in  the  Senate.  There  was  no  effort  made  to  cut  off  a  full  debate.  I  think  every  Senator  believes  he  or  she  had  the  opportunity  they  needed  to  make  their  case,  state  their  positions,  and  raise  their  concerns or why they supported it.  Also,  we  had  numerous  amendments,  and  all  of  them  failed.  Some  of  them  were very attractive. In fact, I felt very  strongly  about  a  couple  of  them,  obviously.  But  they  waded  through  all  of  this  and  we  are  going  to  have  a  final  vote in a moment. I think it is going to  be  an  overwhelming  vote.  I  think  it  is  the  right  thing  to  do  and  I  commend  Chairman ROTH and  Senator MOYNIHAN  for their leadership.  When  history  is  written  about  this  session,  one  of  the  things  I  believe  it  will say is that this is a session of Congress that did spend time and wound up  passing  some  important  trade  bills  with relation to not only China but the  Caribbean  and  also  Africa.  A  lot  of  credit  goes  to  the  leaders  of  this  committee.  Regardless of one\u2019s views on the merits,  there  is  no  question  about  the  significance  of  the  measure  we  consider  today.  Normalizing  trade  relations  with China will not only have profound  effects  upon  our  economic  well-being,  but  it  will  undoubtedly  have  significant  implications  for  our  relations  with China and our national security.  China  accounts  for  a  quarter  of  the  world\u2019s  population.  It  has  one  of  the  largest  economies  in  the  world\u2014an  economy that has been growing at a remarkable  rate  of  nearly  10  percent  per  year.  China  unquestionably  is  and  will  be  a  major  factor  in  the  world,  especially economically.  There  is  also  no  question  that  China\u2019s  entry  into  the  World  Trade  Organization  holds  great  opportunities  for  the  United  States.  Chief  among  them  are  the  economic  benefits  that  would  flow  from  the  dismantling  of  Chinese  trade  barriers\u2014barriers  that  deny  benefits to our workers and businesses.  But  many  people  in  this  country  have  legitimate  questions.  They  question  whether  China  will  live  up  to  its  commitments,  whether  it  will  trade  fairly  in  our  market,  and  whether  we  are  ignoring  China\u2019s  human  rights  abuses and its destabilizing behavior in  the world.  These  are  not  questions  to  be  taken  lightly. And that is why I have insisted  that  the  Senate  not  rush  to  action  on  this  bill,  and  that  those  on  both  sides  have  a  full  opportunity  to  air  their  views and their amendments.  The  Senate  has  had  ample  time  to  consider  the  agreements  reached  with  China,  has  held  numerous  hearings  on  its potential accession to the WTO, and  has  engaged  in  a  full  and  vigorous  debate on this issue. That is certainly fitting on an issue of this magnitude.  I  know  that  many  of  my  colleagues,  like  myself,  have  struggled  with  this  issue  in  light  of  our  larger  concerns  about  China  and  its  behavior  in  the  world. We all know that China is a one-  party  State  that  denies  the most  basic  rights  to  its  people. We must  acknowledge  that  it  deprives  its  people  of  religious  freedom,  that  it  has  flagrantly  engaged  in  weapons  proliferation,  and  that it has repeatedly used unfair trade  practices in our market.  Whle  some  may  argue  that  we  should, I do not believe that we can totally  separate  these  broader  issues  from the question of our trade relationship with China. But I also believe that  we  cannot  allow  our  desire  for  reform  in  China  to  blind  us  not  only  to  the  benefits  we  receive  from  trade  with  China,  but  from  the  positive  effects  trade may have within that country.  On  balance,  I  am  convinced  that  expanding  our  trading  relation  with  China  is  not  only  in  our  economic  self  interest,  but  in  our  broader  national  interest as well.  There  are  many  misconceptions  about  the  action  Congress  is  taking  with  this  legislation.  Chief  among  them  is  the  view  that we  are  voting  on  whether  to  allow  China  into  the  World  Trade  Organization.  The  fact  is  that  China  will  almost  certainly  enter  the  WTO,  regardless  of  whether  the  United  States approves this legislation.  What  this  legislation  will  decide  is  whether  the  commitments  of  WTO  membership  are  applied  bilaterally  between the United States and China.  Applying WTO commitments to trade  between the United States and China is  in  our  economic  interest\u2014and  for  a  simple  reason.  We  already  grant  China  the  favorable  access  to  our  market  required  by  the  WTO.  China,  however,  does  not  grant  similar  access  to  our  products.  As  such,  this  agreement  will  expand our access to China\u2019s market; it  will  not  expand  China\u2019s  access  to  ours.  Many  of  my  colleagues  have  gone  through  in  detail  the  market-opening  concessions  China  will  be  forced  to  make upon entry into the WTO. Let me  just highlight  some  of  the major  terms  that  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  our  workers and companies:  China  will  be  required  to  cut  tariffs  from  a  current  average  of  almost  25  percent  to  an  average  of  around  9  percent  by  2005\u2014with  particularly  sharp  reductions  for  farm products and  information technology products;  China will  be  required  to  provide  our  companies  with  full  trading  and  distribution  rights\u2014eliminating  the  need  to  go  through  trading  companies  blessed by the Chinese government;  China  will  be  required  to  greatly  expand  access  to  its  market  for  agricultural  goods,  ranging  from  cotton,  wheat,  soybeans,  rice  and  farm  products across the spectrum.  China  will  for  the  first  time  be  required  to  provide  real  access  to  financial  services  providers\u2014allowing  U.S.  banks, insurers and other providers significant new access.  Why  would  we  walk  away  from  these  new  and  dramatic  benefits\u2014particularly  when  our  market  is  already  open  to Chinese imports?  Both  the  farming  and manufacturing  community  in  my  home  state\u2014as  in  states  across  the  country\u2014have  voiced  strong  support  for  increased trade with  China.  They  know  that  we  cannot  afford  to  neglect  economic  ties  with  a  nation  of  more  than  1  billion  people,  and  a  market that already is the sixth largest for  U.S.  agricultural  exports.  They  know  that  with  expanded  trade  China  is  projected  to  account  for  more  than  one  third of the growth in U.S. agricultural  exports.

I  have  long  since  learned  in my  business  career  that  one  of  the  quickest  ways  to  temporarily  show  an  increase  on  the  bottom  line  is  to  cut  back on maintenance. One of the surest  ways  to  guarantee  that  you  will  get  into  trouble  long  term  is  to  cut  back  on  maintenance.  We  have  tried  to  make  sure  that  we  didn\u2019t  make  that  mistake  here  in  our  desire  to  hold  down  the  total  amount  that  was  being  spent.  We  have  also  spent  a  great  deal  of  time  talking  about  security.  We  made  sure  that  the  resources  were  made  available  to  the  men  and  women  who  protect  the  Capitol,  its  visitors,  and  Members and staff.  I  think  we  have  accomplished  all  of  our  goals  within  the  current  funding  restraints.  The  conference  agreement  on  the  legislative  branch  is  a  good  agreement.

I  also  thank  the  staff  people  he  has  duly  mentioned,  and  I  want  to  speak  particularly to the funding of the legislative branch.  It  is my understanding on our  side of  the  aisle  that  there  is  deep  concern  about  the  addition  of  the  Treasury-  Postal  bill  on  this  bill,  largely  because  it  contains  a measure  which  would  use  25  percent  of  the  non-Social  Security  surplus.  I  will  leave  that  to  others  to  discuss.  Senator  and  I  worked  in  a  bipartisan  way  on  the  fiscal  year  2001  legislative branch appropriations bill. I  believe it is a very good bill. It addresses  the  critical  areas  of  concern  for  the  legislative branch and is in the best interests  of  those  whom  we  serve.  We  worked  very  hard  to  ensure  that  each  agency  within  our  legislative  branch  was  treated  fairly,  and  even  though we  were  not  able  to  fully  fund  every  agency\u2019s  request,  we  made  every  effort  to  distribute the scarce resources as fairly  BENNETT time,  Senmy  of  Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:26 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S19SE0.REC S19SE0 as possible. In some cases, we were able  to  make  modest  increases  above  last  year\u2019s level.  I particularly note that the $97.1 million  which  we  are  providing  for  the  Capitol  Police  will  fund  1,481  full-time  equivalents, a level which conferees believe  will  enable  the  appropriate  staffing  at  building  entrances  to  ensure  the  security of our Capitol campus.  Additionally,  in  order  to  address  some  very  critical  needs,  the  conference agreement provides  to  the Capitol  Police  $2.1  million  in  fiscal  year  2000  emergency  supplemental  funds  for  security  enhancements,  and  provides  the  Architect  of  the  Capitol  $9  million  in  fiscal  year  2000  emergency  supplemental  funds  to  move  forward  with  a  number of urgent building repairs.  This  is  my  second  year  as  ranking  member  of  the  Appropriations  Subcommittee  on  Legislative  Branch,  working  alongside  our  dedicated  and  distinguished  subcommittee  chairman,  Senator  Senator  is  always very open and willing to discuss  the various issues that arise in relation  to this bill. He has been very accommodating to my concerns as well as to the  concerns  of  other  Members  of  the  Senate.  I  know  that  firsthand.  In  fact,  he  never  ceases  to  amaze  me  with  his  extensive  knowledge  of  the  various  departments  and  agencies  under  the  legislative  branch\u2014not  only  their  basic  structure  and  the  function  of  those  agencies  but  their  legislative  histories  as well.

Without  HARKIN,  time,  BOND  have  have  own  the  my  I  I  take  the  floor  today  because  there  is  an  issue  that  has  been  in  and  out  of  this  body  and  is  currently  in  conference negotiations. It is also going to  be  the  highlight  of  the  news  probably  tomorrow.  I understand the Vice President  is  scheduled  to  talk  about  the  HUB  Zone  Program.  This  is  a  program  that  I  authored  in  the  Committee  on  Small  Business  and  this  body  unanimously accepted  3 years ago.  I am concerned  about  it  because  HUB  zones  are  another  example  of  this  administration\u2019s  record  of  squandered  opportunities.  To  begin  at  the  beginning,  in  1997,  the  Committee  on  Small  Business  reported  out  legislation  to  create  the  HUB  Zone  Program\u2014historically  Underutilized  Business  Zones.  This  program  seeks  to use Federal  contracting,  Federal  purchasing,  to  generate  business opportunities and jobs in the areas  of  high  poverty  and  high  unemployment across the Nation.  We  created  incentives  to  get  small  businesses  to  locate  and  bring  jobs  to  the distressed areas, areas that usually  would  not  be  considered  good  places  to  locate  in  general  business  judgment.  These  distressed  areas  lacked  established  customer  bases,  trained  workforces.  They  have  been  out  of  the  economic  mainstream.  But  the  HUB  Zone  Program  was  designed  to  bring  small businesses into the area.  I came up with this idea after talking  with  a  friend  who  headed  up  the  JOBS  Program  in  Kansas  City.  I  asked  him  about  bringing  more  job  training  programs  to  the  inner  city.  He  said:  Stop  sending  us  job  training  programs;  we  have  trained  people  and  retrained  and  retrained. He said: Send us some jobs. I  thought: there\u2019s a good idea.  So  we  set  up  a  program  that  was  designed  to  reward  small  businesses  located  in  areas  of  high  unemployment.  Unfortunately,  when  we  proposed  that  idea,  immediately the Clinton-Gore administration  declared  its  opposition.  I  have a letter from the Administrator of  the  SBA,  enclosing  a  statement  of  administrative policy:  . . . the  administration  remains  concerned  and  opposed  to . . . provisions  relating  to  HUB Zones.  The  administration  raised  a  red  herring  that  has  dogged  the  program  ever  since.  The  alleged  concern  was  that  HUB  Zones  would  somehow  harm  the  8(a)  Minority  Business  Development  Program.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  the  statement of administration policy be printed in the RECORD.  There  being  no  objection,  the  material  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION,  Washington, DC, November 6, 1997.  Hon. JOHN J. LAFALCE,  House of Representatives,  Washington, DC.  DEAR LAFALCE:  CONGRESSMAN The  Administration  supports  reauthorization  of  the  programs  of  the  Small  Business  Administration  and  supports  House  passage  of  S.  1139.

            "222": "S8740  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE September 19, 2000  into  a  legislative  appropriations  conference  report,  is  basically  raising  our  pay without even taking a vote on it.  I  want  to  tell  you  that  is  what  gets  us  in  trouble  with  the  people  we  represent.  This  is  exactly  what  gets  us  in  trouble  with  the  people  we  represent,  and for very good reason.  Maybe  the  majority  leader  didn\u2019t  want  to  have  an  up-or-down  vote.  Maybe  the  majority  party  didn\u2019t  want  to  have  an  up-or-down  vote.  But  I  wanted an opportunity  to come here  to  the  floor  of  the  Senate  and  say  no way  am  I  going  to  support  raising  our  salary  to  $141,000  a  year when  this  Senate  and  this  conference  has  not  been  willing  to  raise  the  minimum  wage  from  $5.15 an hour to $6.15 an hour.  To  be  very  honest  with  Senators,  I  might raise another question, which  is:  Have  we  earned  the  salary  increase?  Have  we  passed  a  Patients\u2019  Bill  of  Rights?  No.  Have  we  passed  prescription drugs extended onto Medicare? No.  Have  we  reauthorized  the  Elementary  and  Secondary  Education  Act?  No.  Have  we  reauthorized  the  Small  Business Administration? No.  In all due respect, we have done hardly  any  of  the  work  of  the  people.  We  have  not  done  much  at  all  when  it  comes  to  the  basic  issues  that  affect  the  lives  of  the  people  we  represent.  Yet we are raising our salary to $141,000  a  year. We  are  putting  it  into  an  unrelated  conference  report  so  that  there  will  not  be  a  vote  on  it.  I  think  that  is  not  a  very  direct  way  of  conducting  business.  I  want  to  remind  my  colleagues  of  the  words  of  Senator  4  years  ago, when  the Senate  voted  to  gut  rule  XXVIII.  That  is  the  Senate  rule  limiting  the  scope  of  conference,  and  we  are  violating  this  conference  report.  I  quote  from Senator KENNEDY. This was  4  years  ago,  and  it  is  so  true  to  be  prophetic.  KENNEDY The  rule  that a  conference  committee  cannot  include  extraneous  matter  is  central  to  the  way  the  Senate  conducts  its  business.  When we send a bill to a conference we do so  knowing  that  the  conference  committee  work  is  likely  to  become  law. Conference  reports  are  privileged.  Motions  to  proceed  to  them  cannot  be  debated,  and  such  reports  cannot  be  amended.  So  conference  committees  are  already  very  powerful.  But  if  conference  committees  are  permitted  to  add  completely  extraneous  matters  in  conference\u2014that  is,  if the point of order against  such  conduct  becomes  a  dead  letter\u2014conferees  will  acquire  unprecedented  power.  They will  acquire  the  power  to  legislate  in  a  privileged,  unrenewable  fashion  on  virtually  any  subject. They will  be  able  to  completely  bypass  the  deliberative  process  of  the  Senate.  Mr.  President,  it  is  a  highly  dangerous  situation.  It will make  all  of  us  less  willing  to  send  bills  to  conference  and  will  leave  all  of  us  vulnerable  to  passage  of  controversial,  extraneous  legislation  any  time  a  bill  goes  to  conference.  I  hope  the  Senate  will  not  go  down this road. Today the narrow issue  is  the  status  of  one  corporation  under  the  labor  laws,  but  tomorrow  the  issue  might  be  civil  rights,  States  rights,  KENNEDY health  care,  education,  or  anything  else.  It  might  be  a  matter  much  more  sweeping  than  the  labor  law  issue  that  is before us today.  That  is  exactly  what  we  have  done.  What we have here today  is a mini-omnibus measure, and I think it is exactly  the  road  that  Senator  was  warning we should not go down.  I say to colleagues that I think every  Senator ought to object to what we are  doing\u2014every  Senator,  Democrat  and  Republican alike.  We  had  an  opportunity  in  the  later  months  of  this  summer  when  we  came  back  to  bring  this  appropriations  bill  to  the  floor.  We  could  have  dealt  with  the  Treasury-Postal  appropriations  bill. If we had, I would have brought an  amendment to knock out our salary increase.  I  would  have  added  an  amendment  that  said we  do not  raise  our  salary  increase  to  $141,000  a  year  until  we  raise  the  minimum  wage.  I  would  like  to  have  had  an  up-or-down  vote.  All  of  us  would  have  been  held  accountable,  but  that  is  not  the  way  it  was  done.  The  majority  party  apparently  doesn\u2019t  want  to  have  any  votes  any  longer  on  any  amendments  whereby  we  will  be  held accountable.  Instead,  anytime  a  Member  desires\u2014  and  I  hope  other  Democrats  will  speak  on  this\u2014it  is  true,  they  can  take  unrelated  issues  in  matters,  put  it  into  a  conference report, vote to raise our salary  to  $141,000  a  year  when  we  are  not  willing  to  raise  the  minimum  wage  from  $5.15  to  $6.15  over  2  years.  They  are  in  the  majority.  They  can  put  it  into  an  unrelated  conference  report,  bulldoze  it  over  us,  and  pass  this  legislation.  As  a  Senator  from  Minnesota,  I  am  not  going  to  let  it  happen  without  speaking  about  it.  There  will  come  a  time  when  they may  not  be  in  the majority and there will come a time when  they  may  find  provisions  that  are  put  into  conference  reports  unrelated  to  the  scope  of  that  conference  report  antithetical  to  the  values  they  believe  in,  against  what  they  think  is  right,  against a Member\u2019s ability to represent  their  State,  and  they  won\u2019t  like  it  one  bit.  But  that  is  exactly  what  has  happened  today.  It  is  not  because  of  the  Presiding  Officer  right  now,  the  Senator  from  Utah.  But  I  believe  this  is  truly an egregious process.  Again,  one  more  time\u2014just  to  be  clear  to  those  who  are  following  this  debate\u2014I  want  to  be  on  record.  As  a  Senator  from  the  State  of  Minnesota,  people  did  not  elect  me  to  vote  for  a  salary  increase  to  $141,000  a  year,  people  did  not  elect  me  to  be  here  not  in  a  position  to  bring  out  any  amendments on the floor of the Senate to represent  their  interests,  and  people  certainly  did  not  elect  me  to  let  others  put  a  salary  increase\u2014we  now  go  up  to  $141,000  a  year\u2014in  a  conference  report  so we don\u2019t have an up-or-down vote on  it  without  someone  speaking  out  against it.  I speak out against it. I am not showboating.  I  speak  out  against  it  not  because  I  don\u2019t  think  Senators  should  make a decent salary. First of all, what  bothers me the most is I don\u2019t think we  have  done  much.  I  think  this  has  been  a  do-nothing  Senate.  I  don\u2019t  think  we  have  done much  on most  of  the  crucial  issues  that  affect  people\u2019s  lives.  I  am  not  sure  what  we  have  done  to  earn  this increase.  Second, and I think even more importantly,  I  don\u2019t  know  how  in  the  world  we  can  justify  raising  our  salary  to  $141,000  a  year  when  we  are  not  even  willing  to  raise  the  minimum  wage.  There  are  10  million  people  in  this  country  who  would  directly  benefit,  and  many  others  who  would  indirectly  benefit,  from the raise of the minimum  wage.  There  are  119,826  Minnesotans  who would benefit from a $1 increase in  the minimum wage  over  2  years,  and  if  we  don\u2019t  do  that,  the  minimum  wage  increase  that  we  did  pass  has  essentially lost all of its value. It is not even  keeping up with inflation.  So  colleagues  understand,  we  hear  a  lot  about  the  booming  economy.  It  is  true,  but  not  all  the  new  jobs  that  are  being  created  are  living  wage  jobs.  In  1998,  29  percent  of  all  the workers were  in  jobs  paying  poverty-level  wages.  In  some  of  the  jobs  where  we  have  seen  the  greatest  growth\u2014waiter  staff,  cashiers,  janitors,  and  retail  sales  people\u2014people  earn  less  than  half  of  what  is called a living wage.  A  study  released  by  the  U.S.  Conference  of  Mayors  in  1998  showed  that  nearly  4  out  of  10  Americans  visiting  soup  kitchens  for  emergency  food  were  working;  they  were  working  poor  people.  I  don\u2019t  think  I  want  to  go  into  the  statistics.  We  have  so  many  people  in  this  country  who  could  benefit.  We  have  people who work  52 weeks  a  year,  40  hours  a  week,  and  they  are  still  not  out  of  poverty.  The  raise  in  the  minimum  wage  would  make  a  real  difference, from $5.15 to $6.15 over a 2-year  period.  What  are  we  doing  instead?  Instead,  we  are  raising  our  salary  to  $141,000  a  year. We are raising our salary through  the worst process, whereby  rather  than  risking  someone  bringing  an  amendment  out  and  having  an  up-or-down  vote,  someone  has  put  the  Treasury-  Postal  appropriations  bill  into  the  legislative  appropriations  conference  report.  Quite  clearly,  it  was  done  in  a  very  deliberate  way  so  we  wouldn\u2019t  have to have an up-or-down vote.  In  conclusion,  I  object  to  this  process. I believe one of the worst things we  ever  did  was  make  it  possible  for  the  majority  party\u2014and  I  promise  the  Chair that when we are in the majority  I  will  take  the  same  position\u2014to  basically  waive  the  rule  and  insist  measures  that  are  put  in  conference  committee  be  related  to  the  subject  material,  that  we  no  longer  have  to  deal  with  the  scope  of  the  conference,  the  worst  thing we  could have  ever done  in  violation of this constitutional process,  and  certainly  in  violation  of  the  very  notion of accountability.

Mr.  President,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  there  now  be  a  period  for  the  transaction  of  morning  business  with  Senators  permitted  to  speak for up to 10 minutes each.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Without  objection, it is so ordered.  f  BIG  PRESCRIPTION  DRUGS:  IN  THE  TENT  OR  A  SIDE  SHOW  Mr.  GRAHAM.  Mr.  President,  this  is  the  third  in  a  series  of  five  statements  I  am  making  on  the  issue  of  providing  a  prescription  drug  benefit  for  senior  Americans.  This  continues  the  discussion  I  began  last  Thursday  on  the  subject  of  how  to  modernize  the  Medicare  program  into  one  which  will  meet  the  needs  of  21st  century  seniors  in  America.  Last  week,  we  discussed  the  need  to  fundamentally  reform  the  Medicare  program  by  shifting  its  focus  from  treating acute illness to promoting and  maintaining  wellness,  essentially  converting the Medicare program from one  which  has  an  orientation  towards  dealing with the disease or the results of an  accident  after  they  have  occurred\u2014a  sickness  system\u2014to  one  that  attempts  to  maintain  the  highest  quality  of  health\u2014a wellness system.  We  discussed  the  fact  that  access  to  affordable  prescription  medications  is  crucial  to  the  success  of  a  health  care  system  based  on  keeping  seniors  healthy, well, and active. And virtually  every  modality  that  is  established  to  maintain  the  highest  state  of  good  health  for  seniors  involves  access  to  prescription drugs.  Additionally,  we  discussed  that,  in  the long run, providing seniors with access  to  those  components  of  an  effective  wellness  system,  such  as  preventive screening, medical procedures, and  appropriate  prescription  drug  therapies,  can  yield  significant  savings  for  the Medicare  program  and  thus  for  the  American taxpayer as well as providing  the  enormous  benefits  to  the  senior  of  good  health  and  the  active  lifestyle  that that will allow.  Let\u2019s look at the case of osteoporosis.  Osteoporosis  is  a  disease  characterized  by  low  bone  mass,  deterioration  of  bone  tissue,  leading  to  bone  fragility  and  increased  susceptibility  to  fractures,  particularly  of  the  hip,  spine,  and wrist.  Osteoporosis  is  a major  public health  threat for 28 million Americans. Eighty  percent  of  those  28  million  Americans  are  women.  Osteoporosis  is  responsible  for  more  than  1.5  million  fractures  annually  in  the  United  States.  Included  in  this  1.5  million  are  300,000  hip  fractures,  700,000  vertebra  fractures,  250,000  wrist  fractures,  and  more  than  300,000  fractures  in  other  parts  of  the  anatomy.  Estimated  national  direct  expenditures,  including  those  for  hospitals  and  nursing  homes,  for  osteoporosis  and  related  fractures  is  $14 billion a year.  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  and  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  agree  that  osteoporosis  is  highly  preventable.  A  combination  of  a  healthy  lifestyle,  with  no  smoking  or  excessive  alcohol  use,  and  bone  density  testing  and medication  and  hormone  therapies  can keep men and women prone  to  this  disease  well  and  free  of  the  debilitating, sometimes  fatal, effects of  fractures.  Seniors  and  near  seniors  must  have  access  to  screening,  counseling,  and  appropriate  medication  to  keep  this \u2018\u2018silent killer\u2019\u2019 at bay.  One  of  the  most  common  prescriptions  for  osteoporosis  prevention  is  a  treatment  referred  to  as Fosamax. The  annual  cost  of  Fosamax  is  approximately  $750.  Contrast  that  with  a  hip  replacement where the surgery and  followup  therapy  will  cost  the  Medicare  program and taxpayers over $8,000.  It makes both programmatic and economic  sense  that  these  preventive  interventions be included under the big  tent of Medicare. They should be treated  as  all  of  the  other  benefits  that  98  percent  of  those  eligible  for  Medicare  enjoy today.  Let  me  restate  the  fact  that  Part  B  of  Medicare\u2014that  is  the  part  that,  among  other  things,  covers  physicians  and outpatient services\u2014is a voluntary  program  that  seniors must  elect  to  get  the  benefits  and  to  pay  the  monthly  premiums  for  participation  in  Part  B.  How  many  seniors  in  America  who  are  eligible  for  that  component  of  Medicare in fact make that election and pay  that monthly  fee  to get  those benefits?  The  answer:  98  percent  of  eligible  seniors  voluntarily  elect  to  participate  in  Part B of Medicare.  Seniors  trust  and  rely  on  Medicare.  As  a  result,  virtually  all who  are  eligible  to  join  voluntarily  elect  to  do  so.  When  the  Federal  Government  decides  that  it  should  participate  in  providing  a  prescription  drug  benefit  for  American seniors, that benefit  is best placed  under  the  same  big  tent  of  the  Medicare program.  Now,  this  is  not  a  unanimous  opinion.  Some  of  my  Senate  colleagues  believe  that  a  prescription  drug  benefit  should  be  left  outside  the  tent,  left  to  a  sideshow  status,  if  you  will.  In  order  to  determine  which  way  is  truly  the  best way,  the main  tent  of Medicare  or  a  sideshow,  it  is  important  to  answer  some key questions.  Question  1  is  what  do  the  customers,  the  seniors  and  the  people  who  live  with  disabilities,  what  do  they  want?  How would  they  prefer  this  program  to  be  organized  and  administered?  We  all  know  the  old  saying  that  the  customer  is always right. This will surely be true  for  the  new  drug  benefit  that  we  will  offer  to  Medicare  beneficiaries.  Congress must  learn  to  ask  and  to  listen\u2014  in  health  care  terminology,  to  first  diagnose before we proceed to prescribe.  This  should  have  been  the  lesson  learned  from  Congress\u2019  ill-considered  decision  to  add  catastrophic  coverage  to  Medicare  in  the  late  1980s.  We  prescribed before we listened. When we listen,  seniors  tell  us  they  like  the Medicare  program.  Ninety-eight  percent  of  them  voluntarily  elect  to  participate.  In  1998,  the  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  found  that  74  percent  of  seniors  surveyed believed that Medicare was doing  a good job serving their interests.  Seniors tell us that while Medicare is  not  perfect,  it  is  convenient,  affordable, and dependable. They never worry  that  the  benefits  will  suddenly  disappear  or  become  too  expensive.  They  like  the  universality  of  the  Medicare  program. No matter where they are\u2014in  Kansas,  in  Utah,  or  in  Florida\u2014the  benefits  are  available  and  affordable.  They  don\u2019t  want  to  worry,  as  they  would  in some plans, that an  income of  $16,000  a  year  would  make  them  \u2018\u2018too  wealthy\u2019\u2019 to qualify for help.  Including  the  prescription  drug  benefit  in  Medicare  would  offer  peace  of  mind.  But  don\u2019t  take  my  word  for  it.  Another  recent  poll  conducted  by  the  Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard  University  showed  that  when  seniors  are given  the choice of having  the Federal  Government  administer  a  Medicare  prescription  drug  benefit  versus  the  alternative  of  having  the  Government  help  to  pay  for  private  insurance  plans,  36  percent  chose  the  private  option;  57  percent  of  the  respondents  preferred  to  have  the  benefit  as  part  of  an  expanded Medicare program.  We  hear  over  and  over  in  statements  on  the  Senate  floor  and  occasionally  even  in  political  ads  that  Americans  will  be  better  off  if  prescription  drug  benefits are not made part of the Medicare  program.  But  when  we  listen  to  the  people,  not  to  just  political  rhetoric,  what  we  find  is  that  Medicare  beneficiaries  do  not  complain  about  Medicare.  Rather,  we  hear  a  desire  to  expand  Medicare  to  include  real  prescription  drug  benefits.  We  should  listen to these voices of the customers.  Question  2: Will  a  true Medicare  benefit or a program that relies on private  and  State  insurers  be  the  most  reliable?  Predictability,  sustainability,  reliability  are  important  qualities  for  America\u2019s  seniors.  The  bill  I  have  introduced  with  Senators  ROBB,  BRYAN,  CONRAD, CHAFEE, and JEFFORDS assures  that  all  beneficiaries,  including  those  in  underserved  and  rural  areas,  would  be  guaranteed  a  defined,  accessible,  affordable,  and  stable  benefit  for  the  same  monthly  premium  nationwide.  Medicare  would  subsidize  benefits  directly  and  pay  for  prescription  drug  costs as any other Medicare benefit.  In  contrast,  the  plan  that  is  being  proposed  by  Governor  George  W.  Bush  and by House Republicans and by  some  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:26 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00082 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S19SE0.REC S19SE0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",
            "238": "S8756  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE September 19, 2000  casualties  are  greatly  reduced  as  a  result.  The  amazing  performance  of  the  Air  Force  in  the  Persian  Gulf  War,  which  by  all  accounts  dramatically  reduced  the  number  of  American  lives  lost  in  that  conflict,  shows  just  how  much we all owe our brave airmen.  In  addition  to  its  critical  defense  role,  the  Air  Force  has  been  highly  active  in  humanitarian  and  relief  efforts  over the years. One of the most  famous  of  these  undertakings  was  the  Berlin  airlift between June 1948 and June 1949.  The  largest  airlift/evacuation  in American  history  occurred  in  1991  when  the  Air  Force  moved  52,000  military  personnel  and  dependents  from  the  Philippines  to  the  U.S.  following  the  eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. An airlift  in February  of  1992  provided  food  and  medicine  to  Russia  in  Operation  Provide  Hope. Operation Provide Promise, a  relief effort into Sarajevo in 1992, was the  longest  sustained  humanitarian  airlift  in history. The Air Force has also been  involved  in  hundreds  and  hundreds  of  other  relief missions  all  over  the world  in response to earthquakes, hurricanes,  and other natural disasters.  I would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to note the contributions made by Minnesotans  and  those  men  and  women  serving at Minnesota\u2019s Air Force bases.  These  airmen  have  made  a  vital  contribution  to  the  success  of  the  Air  Force  over  the  past  53  years.  I  would  like  to  thank  in  particular  those  serving  at  Minnesota\u2019s  Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard  facilities,  specifically  the airmen of  the  934th Airlift  Wing  and  133rd  Airlift  Wing  in  Minneapolis  and  the  148th  Fighter Wing  in  Duluth  who  keep  our  C\u2013130s  and  F\u201316s  flying.  These  men  and  women  deserve  our  thanks  for  making  sure  that  we  will  always  be  prepared  to  face  with  confidence  any  future  threats  to  our  nation\u2019s security.  On behalf of all Minnesotans, I thank  the members  of  the Air  Force  for  their  selfless  devotion  to  our  nation\u2019s  defense.  Throughout  the  history  of  the  Air  Force,  its  members  have  made  countless  sacrifices  for  their  country,  from  the  financial  struggles  all  too  often  faced  by  service  members  and  their families, to the high price paid by  those  who  have  been  wounded,  taken  prisoner,  or killed  in  battle. A  grateful  nation will always be in their debt.  I\u2019m  sure  my  colleagues  will  join  me  in  recognizing  the  rich  heritage  and  dedicated  service  of  the  United  States  Air Force on its anniversary.\u2211  f  MESSAGES  FROM  THE  PRESIDENT  Messages  from  the  President  of  the  United  States  were  communicated  to  the  Senate  by  Ms.  Evans,  one  of  his  secretaries.

The  CDA,  which  provides  that  telecommunications  services  are  permitted  between  the  United  States  and  Cuba,  specifically  authorizes  the  President  to  provide  for  these  payments  by  license.  The  CDA  states  that licenses may be issued for full or partial  payment of amounts due as a result of provision  of  telecommunications  services  authorized by  this  subsection, but  shall not  require  any withdrawal from a blocked account. Following  enactment  of  the  CDA  on  October  23,  1992,  a  number  of  U.S.  telecommunications  companies  successfully  negotiated  agreements  to  provide  telecommunications  services  between  the  United  States  and  Cuba  consistent  with  policy  guidelines  developed  by  the  Department  of  State  and  the  Federal  Communications Commission.  Subsequent  to  enactment  of  the  CDA,  the  Department  of  the  Treasury\u2019s  Office  of  Foreign  Assets  Control  (\u2018\u2018OFAC\u2019\u2019)  amended  the  Cuban  Assets  Control  Regulations,  31  C.F.R.  Part  515  (the  \u2018\u2018CACR\u2019\u2019),  to  provide  for  specific licensing on a case-by-case basis for certain  transactions  incident  to  the  receipt  or  transmission of telecommunications between  the  United  States  and  Cuba,  31  C.F.R.  515.542(c),  including  settlement  of  charges  under traffic agreements.  OFAC  has  issued  eight  (8)  licenses  authorizing  transactions  incident  to  the  receipt  of  transmission of telecommunications between  the  United  States  and  Cuba  since  the  enactment of  the CDA. None of  these  licenses permits  payments  from  a  blocked  account.  The  licenses  are  AT&T  Corporation  (formerly,  American  Telephone  and  Telegraph  Company), AT&T  de Puerto Rico,  IDB WorldCom  Services,  Inc.

During  the  period  January  1  through  June  30,  2000,  the  licensees  transferred  funds  to  the  Cuban  telecommunications  company  Empresa  de  Telecommunicaciones  de  Cuba,  S.A.

            "246": "S8764  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE September 19, 2000  Perhaps the federalism decisions that  have  marked  the  tenure  of  the  Rehnquist  Court  ultimately  will  serve  to check  the expansion of  federal  jurisdiction  and  the  caseload  burdens  and  need  for  new  judges  that  necessarily  follow  such  expansion.  Presently,  however,  many  of  our  judges\u2014especially  those  in  the  border  states  of  Texas,  New  Mexico,  Arizona  and  California\u2014  are  overburdened  by  heavy  caseloads.  Caseload statistics compiled by the Judicial Conference have convinced me of  the  need  for  a  debate  about  new  judgeships.  In  this  debate, we must  ask  ourselves: How large do we really want our  federal judiciary to be?  It  should  be  noted  that  over  the  past  22  years,  the  judiciary  has  grown  substantially.  Currently,  there  are  848  judgeships  created  pursuant  to  article  III  of  the  Constitution.  By  contrast,  just  23  years  ago,  there  were  only  509  Article  III  judgeships.  this  growth  in  the  size  of  the  federal  judiciary\u2014a  67  percent  increase\u2014has  outpaced  growth  in the size of the United States. During  the  same  period,  the  population  of  the  United States has grown by just 24 percent, from 220 million to 275 million.  Given  that  there  are  only  a  few  weeks  remaining  in  this  Congress,  it  is  going  to  be  difficult  to  achieve  consensus  on  a  comprehensive  judgeship  bill.  Nevertheless,  it  is  important  that  the views of the Judicial Conference on  the issue of judgeship be brought to the  attention of the Congress and given the  appropriate  level  of  consideration.  Still,  it  is  possible  that  consensus may  be  reached  on  legislation  authorizing  new  judgeships.  I  know  that  many  of  my colleagues share my concerns about  the  expansion  of  the  federal  judiciary.  It  is  my  judgment,  however,  that  the  Judicial  Conference\u2019s  recommendation  that  additional  judgeships  be  created  be brought to the attention of the Congress. I look forward to a dialogue with  my colleagues on this issue.  Mr.  LEAHY.  Mr.  President,  today  Senator  and  I  are  introducing  the Federal Judgeship Act of 2000. I am  pleased that Senators FEINSTEIN, SCHUREID,  ROBB,  MER,  BOXER,  GRAHAM,  INOUYE,  EDWARDS,  MURRAY,  BINGAMAN,  KERREY,  DOMENICI HATCH and  original  are  joincosponsors  of  this  BAYH,  ing  us  as  measure.  Our  bill  creates  70  judgeships  across  the  country  to  address  the  workload  needs  of  the  federal  judiciary. This  bill  incorporates  the  recommendations  for  additional  judgeships  most  recently  forwarded  to  us  by  the  Judiciary  Conference  of  the  United  States.  Specifically, our legislation would create 6 additional  permanent  judgeships  and  4  temporary  judgeships  for  the  U.S.  Courts  of  Appeal;  30  additional  permanent  judgeships  and  23  temporary  judgeships  for  the U.S. District Courts;  and  convert  7  existing  temporary  district  judgeships  into  permanent  positions.  The  Judicial  Conference  of  the  United  States  is  the  nonpartisan  policy-making  arm  of  the  judicial  branch.  Federal  judges  across  the  nation  believe  that  the  increasingly  heavy  caseloads  of  our  courts  necessitate  these  additional  judges.  The  Chief  Justice  of  the  United  States  in  his  annual  year-  end  reports  over  the  last  several  years  has  commented  on  the  serious  problems  facing  our  federal  courts  having  too much  work  and  too  few  judges  and  other resources.  The  Judicial  Conference  and  Chief  Justice  Rehnquist  are  right.  According  to  his  1999  year-end  report,  the  filings  in  our  federal  courts  have  reached  record  heights.  In  fact,  the  numbers  of  criminal  cases  and  defendants  have  reached  their  highest  levels  since  the  Prohibition  Amendment  was  repealed  in 1933. In 1999, overall growth in appellate  court  caseload  included  a  349  percent  upsurge  in  original  proceedings.  This  sudden  expansion  resulted  from  newly  implemented  reporting  procedures,  which  more  accurately  measure  the  increased  judicial  workload  generated  by  the  Prisoner  Litigation  Reform Act and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act,  both  passed  in 1996.  District  court  activity  was  characterized  by  an  increase  in  criminal  filings  and  a  smaller  increase  in  civil  filings.  Criminal  case  filings  rose  4  percent from 57,691 in 1998 to 59,923 in 1999,  and  the  number  of  defendants  grew  2  percent  from  79,008  to  80,822.  Criminal  case  filings  per  authorized  judgeship  went  up  almost  5  percent.  Since  the  last  significant  expansion  of  the  federal  judiciary  in  1990,  felony  criminal  case  filings  have  increased  almost  50  percent,  from  31,727  in  1990  to  46,789  in  1999.  Despite  these  dramatic  increases  in  case  filings,  Congress  has  failed  to  authorize  new  judgeships  since  1990,  thus  endangering  the  administration  of  justice  in  our  nation\u2019s  federal  courts.  Without  the  extraordinary  contributes  of  our  senior  judges,  the  administration  of  justice  could  well  have  broken  down entirely.  Over  the  last  several  decades,  a  6-  year  cycle  for  reviewing  the  needs  of  the  judiciary  and  authorizing  additional  judgeships  had  been  followed  by  Democrats  and  Republicans  alike.  For  example,  in  1978, Congress passed  legislation  to  address  the  need  for  additional  judgeships.  Six  years  later,  in  1984,  Congress  passed  legislation  creating  additional  judgeships.  Then,  again  six  years  later,  in  1990,  Democratic  majorities  in  both  Houses  of  Congress  fulfilled  their  constitutional  responsibilities  and  enacted  the  Federal  Judgeship  Act  of  1990  because  of  a  sharply  increasing  caseload,  particularly  for  drug-related  crimes.  At  that  time  President  Bush was  in  the middle  of his first term in office.  That  type  of  bipartisan  effort  broke  down  in  1996.  It  has  now  been  10  years  since Congress made a systematic evaluation  of  the  needs  of  the  federal  judiciary  and  acted  to  meet  those  needs.  For  each  of  the  last  two  Congresses,  the  Republican  majority  has  resisted  STEIN FEINany  such  action.  Three  years  ago,  the  Judicial  Conference  requested  an  additional  55  judgeships  to  address  the  growing  backlog.  I  introduced  the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, S. 678,  legislation  based  on  the  Judicial  Conference\u2019s  1997  recommendations.  That  legislation  languished  in  the  Judicial  Committee  without  action  during  both  sessions  of  the  last  Congress.  Again  last  year,  the  Judicial  Conference  updated  its  request  and  recommended  an  additional  72  judgeships.  I,  again,  introduced those recommendations in the  Federal  Judgeship  Act  of  1999,  S.  1145.  There  was  no  action  on  it  by  the  Judiciary Committee.  This  year,  the  Judiciary  Conference  took  the  unusual  step  of  updating  last  year\u2019s  recommendations  yet  again.  Those  updated  recommendations  affect  70 judgeships. Today may signal a turning  point  in  our  efforts.  Today  Republicans  are  joining  with  us.  I  welcome  them to this effort and  look  forward to  working with  them  to  pass  the Federal  Judgeship Act of 2000.  Included within  our  bill  are  the  additional judgeships that would be authorized  by  S.  2730,  the  Southwest  Border  Judgeship  Act  of  2000.  Senator  has been tenacious in seeking the  resources  needed  the  federal  courts  of  our  southwest  border  States,  including  southern California. She is right. Those  13  judgeships  for  California,  Arizona,  New  Mexico  and  Texas  are  included  in  our bill.  Implicit  in  our  legislation  is  acknowledgment  that  the  federal  judiciary  does  not  just  have  64  current  vacancies  with  9  of  the  horizon,  but  that  even  if  all  those  vacancies  were  filled,  the  federal  judiciary  would  remain  70  judges  short of  those  it needed  to manage its workload, try the cases and provide  the  individual  attention  to  matters  that  have  set  a  high  standard  for  the  administration  of  justice  in  our  federal  system.  In  other  words,  considering  vacancies  and  taking  into  account  the  judgeships  authorized  by  our  bill,  the  federal  judiciary  is  today  in  need of more than 130 more judges.  We  have  the  greatest  judicial  system  in the world, the envy of people around  the  globe  who  are  struggling  for  freedom.  It  is  the  independence  of  our  third,  co-equal  branch  of  government  that  gives  it  the  ability  to  act  fairly  and  impartially.  It  is  our  judiciary  that  has  for  so  long  protected  our  fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  and  served  as  a  necessary  check  on  overreaching  by  the  other  two  branches,  those  more  susceptible  to  the  gusts  of  the political winds.  Let  us  act  to  ensure  that  justice  in  our  federal  courts  is  not  delayed  or  denied  for  anyone.  I  urge  the  Senate  to  do  in  this  last  month  of  this  Congress  what  the  Republican  majority  has  so  strenuously  resisted  for  the  last  four  years: Enact the Federal Judgeship Act  without further delay.

This  Act was  enacted  in  response  to  rising  drug  prices and  assertions  by  drug  companies  that  long regulatory  delays  increased  costs  for  consumers.  The  Act  served  as  a  compromise  between  the  competing  interests  of  generic  and brand  name  drug  manufacturers.  Under  the Act,  brand  drug  companies  received  extended patent  periods.  The  patent  extensions  were designed  to  enable  brand  companies  to  make greater  profits,  which  allow  for  more  research. The Act  also  provided  generic  drug  companies with  the  right  to  develop  less-costly  generic versions  of  brand  drugs  as  the  patents  expire. The  Act  has  been  a  success  for  two  reasons.  First,  it  provides  brand  name  and  generic  drug  companies  with  incentives  to  provide  better  quality  products  for  consumers; and  second,  it  encourages  the  brand  name  industry  to  dedicate  more  of  its  profits  to  research  and  development  of  new  drugs  under a  set patent expiration date. The  best  way  to  ensure  continued  investment  in  new  drug  research  is  to  make  sure the  Hatch/Waxman  Act  is  enforced  fairly  and consistently.  By  doing  this,  we  can  give  the American  public  greater  access  to  innovative and  affordable  medicine,  and  drug  companies will  have  the  incentives  intended  by  Congress to  continue  to provide  their  services. f HISPANIC  HERITAGE  MONTH HON.  TOM  UDALL OF NEW MEXICO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, September 19, 2000 Mr.  UDALL  of  New  Mexico.  Mr.  Speaker, Friday, September  15 marked  the  beginning  of \u2018\u2018Hispanic  Heritage  Month.\u2019\u2019  Our  country\u2019s  history  has  been  richly  enhanced  by  the  contributions  Hispanic-Americans  have  given  us.  I  am happy  to  take  part  in  recognizing  these  contributions.  In  my  home  state  of  New  Mexico we  are  proud  of  our  Hispanic  heritage,  which reflects  the  influence of many  cultures. Not  only  has  New  Mexico\u2019s  history  been shaped  in  part  by  its  Hispanic  heritage,  but  so has  the  history  of  our  entire  Southwest.  Indeed,  the  reach  of  that  Hispanic  heritage  extended  into  our  eastern  manufacturing  centers in  the  19th Century.  It  is  sad  that  this  rich  contribution  to  our  national  history  is  often  overlooked.  But  as  the  Hispanic  presence  in  our country  grows,  we  cannot  continue  to  ignore the  part  of  the  American  heritage  that  played itself  out  predominantly  in\u2014but  not  only  in\u2014 the  huge  territory  comprised  of  what  is  now the  states  of  New  Mexico,  Arizona,  Texas, California,  Colorado,  Utah,  Nevada  and  even Oklahoma,  Kansas,  Missouri  and  Louisiana.  (I say  \u2018\u2018predominantly  in\u2019\u2019  because  the  first  continuing  Hispanic  presence  in  our  country  is generally  recognized  as  having  occurred  in  St. Augustine, Florida.) To  return  to  New  Mexico  and  my  district, New  Mexico  may  have  been  traversed  by \u02dc Alvaro  Nun ez  Cabeza  de  Baca  as  early  as 1536.  However,  New  Mexico  became  the  object  of  focused  exploration  in  1540.  In  that year  Francisco  Vasquez  de  Coronado  led  an expedition  into  New  Mexico  and  then  out across  the  Great  Plains.  This  was  the  first documented  encounter  between New Mexico\u2019s Native  American  communities  and  Hispanic explorers\u2014encounters  that  varied  in  the  degree  of  conflict  that  occurred  between  the members  of  our  indigenous  cultures  and  those explorers,  but  encounters  that  also  began  a centuries-long  process  of  cultural  exchange and  mutual  adaptation  that  eventually  shaped the Hispanic Southwest. Unfortunately,  the  next  400  years  of  Hispanic  history  in  New  Mexico\u2014and,  indeed,  in the  Southwest\u2014have  been  neglected  and overlooked.  And  this  rich  history  has  also been  inappropriately  obscured  under  the  cover of  past  prejudices.  Even  the  use  of  the  term \u2018\u2018Spaniard\u2019\u2019  in  referring  to  those  early  European  explorers  and  settlers  ignores  the  fact that many  of  those Spaniards  came  from  other European  countries\u2014Italy,  Flanders,  Germany,  Greece  and  even  Ireland  and  England. And while  some Spaniards  undoubtedly  visited and  explored  New  Mexico  in  search  of  riches, and  Spanish  missionaries  were  intent  on  converting  Native  Americans  to  Christianity,  it  is clear  that  most  of  the  early  Spanish  colonists came  to  find  a  new  life  for  themselves  in  a new  land.  And  others,  it  has  become  increasingly  clear,  came  to  escape  the  Inquisition  and find  a  measure  of  religious  freedom  for  themselves. The  Spanish  Crown\u2019s  first  effort  to  actually settle  New  Mexico  occurred  in  1590.  Gaspar \u02dc Castan o de Sosa  led a wagon  train of Spanish and  Portuguese  settlers\u2014many  of  them  possibly  Sefarad,  Iberian  Jews\u2014from  the  area near  present-day  Monterrey,  Mexico  up  the Rio  Grande  and  then  north  along  the  Pecos River  to  \u2018\u2018winter  over\u2019\u2019  at  Pecos  Pueblo  in  New Mexico.  The  Jamestown,  Virginia  settlement was  still  seventeen  years  in  the  future.  And Plymouth  Rock,  Massachusetts,  was  thirty \u02dc years  away.  In  the  spring  of  1591  Castan o  de Sosa  was  arrested  at  Santo  Domingo  Pueblo, New  Mexico  through  the  machinations  of  a \u02dc rival  Spanish  government  official.  Castan o  de Sosa had moved his  fledgling  colony  to  this  location  by  that  time.  Following  his  arrest  he was  marched  back  to  Mexico  City,  tried,  convicted  of  illegal  settlement  and  then  ordered  to serve  a  sentence  of  hard  labor  on  Spanish ships  employed  in  the  Oriental  trade.  He  was killed  in  a  shipboard  uprising  without  ever learning  that  his  appeal  of  the  sentence  had been  successful  and  the  Spanish  Crown  had ordered  him  back  to  New  Mexico  as  its  first governor. \u02dc In  1597,  after  it  was  clear  that  Castan o  de Sosa  had  forfeited  his  life,  the  Spanish  Crown \u02dc selected  Juan  de  On ate  y  Salazar  to  resettle New Mexico.  A  number  of  the members  of  the \u02dc On ate  settlement  expedition  had  participated in  the  original  settlement  efforts  led  by  Gaspar \u02dc \u02dc Castan o  de  Sosa.  Juan  de  On ate  established his  first  capitol  and  settlement\u2014named  San Gabriel  del  Yunque-Yunque\u2014at  the  Pueblo  of San  Juan  de  los  Caballeros,  NM.  By  about 1605  the  capitol  had  been  moved  to  the  location  it  has  occupied  continuously  for  almost four  hundred  years\u2014Santa  Fe,  New  Mexico. This  makes  Santa  Fe  the  oldest  State  capital in  the  United  States,  pre-dating  the  landing  at Plymouth  Rock  by  more  than  ten  years.  While its  founding  has  been  attributed  to  Don  Pedro de  Peralta  in  1610, more  recent  evidence  indicates  that  it  was  actually  settled  at  an  earlier date. Hispanic  influence  now  permeates  New Mexico.  From  the  dawn  of  the  16th  century, supplies  and  communications  came  into  the area  along  the  Camino  Real  del  Tierra Adentro\u2014the  Royal  Road  of  the  Interior\u2014that still  stretches  2,000  miles  from  Mexico  City  to Santa  Fe.  For  the  next  two  centuries  and  better,  caravans  periodically  made  the  six-month trek  northward.  They  brought  new  crops  and agricultural  techniques,  which  were  combined with  those  of  New  Mexico\u2019s  pre-historic  Native American  Pueblo  communities.  They  brought cattle  and  sheep  and  taught  the  Native  Americans  how  to  raise  them.  They  introduced horses  and  the  wheel,  opening  the  door  to  the worlds  of  transportation,  commerce  and  technology.  They  brought  mining  and  metal-working  techniques  that  were  used  to  produce weapons,  tools and  jewelry. They brought  their cuisine,  which  over  the  ensuing  centuries  has been  synthesized  into  the  unique  cooking  tradition  that  is  so  quintessentially  New  Mexican. Over  the  two  centuries  that  followed  this original  settlement  effort,  New  Mexico  found itself  increasingly  on  the  fringe  of  the  portion of  the  Spanish  empire  administered  from Mexico  City\u2014the  portion  referred  to  as  \u2018\u2018New Spain.\u2019\u2019  New  Mexico\u2019s  early  economic  promise failed  to  develop.  It  was  a  frontier  long  before the  pioneers  on  our  Atlantic  seaboard  began their  westward  venturing,  then  trekking.  And while  that  frontier was  not  an  economic  engine for  New  Spain,  it  became  a  marketplace  for inter-cultural  exchange  and  the  formulation  of the  most  unique  blend  of  cultures  in  our  country. The  descendants  of  those  original  \u2018\u2018Spanish\u2019\u2019  settlers of multi-national origin were  joined by  a  second  wave  of  settlers  following  the  Native  American  uprising  of  1680  and  the  resettlement  of  New  Mexico  by  the  forces  of  the Spanish  Crown  led  by  Diego  de  Vargas  in 1692.  At  annual  trade  fairs  in  Taos,  Santa  Fe or  other  locations,  the  Spanish  settlers  joined with members  of  the  Native  American  Pueblos to  trade  with  the  nomadic  Comanche,  Navajo, Apache,  Kiowa,  Ute  and  other  tribes.  Members  of  those  tribes  left  their  tribal  communities  to  settle  among  the  Spanish  settlers\u2014 sometimes  willingly,  and  sometimes  because they  were  captured  and  forcibly  kept  as  servants.  Spanish  settlers  also  were  forcibly patriated  to  nomadic  tribes.  And  in  the  process, New Mexican  culture gained many unique characteristics.  And  to  the  degree  intermarriage  occurred  between  the  Native  Americans  in  the  Pueblo  communities  and  the Spanish  settlers  there  also  occurred  an  exchange  of  cultures.  By  the  middle  of  the  18th century  a  new  culture  was  added  to  the  general  mix  as  French  traders  began  to  enter New  Mexico  and  to  marry  into  New  Mexico\u2019s families. In  the  19th  Century,  New  Mexico  took,  for  a time,  a  more  prominent  place  in  the  stream  of our  national  commerce  when  the  Santa  Fe Trail  opened.  Hispanic  New  Mexicans  quickly took  advantage  of  this  play  of  fortune,  and  by the  time  that  the  United  States  incorporated the  Southwest  into  our  national  territory,  Hispanics  dominated  trade  on  the  Santa  Fe  Trail. This  created  the  longest  continuous  trade route  in  North  America,  extending  from  East Coast  factories  and  import  houses  all  the  way to  Mexico  City  and  beyond.  However,  as  patterns  of  commerce  began  to  shift  around  the time  of  the  Civil  War,  Hispanic  New  Mexican traders  found  difficulty  in  shifting  to  the  largerscale  operations  necessary  to  survive  in  an  increasingly  competitive  world  of  national  commerce.  The  place  of  New Mexico  as  an  important  juncture  for  national  and  international commerce  also  began  to  lose  ground  as  the VerDate 11<MAY>2000 05:49 Sep 20, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\A19SE8.031 pfrm08 PsN: E19PT1 ",

Under the Speaker\u2019s announced policy of January  19,  1999,  the  gentleman  from Pennsylvania  (Mr.  is  recognized  during  morning  debates  for 5 minutes. Mr.  HOEFFEL.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  to  my  colleague  from  Ohio  (Mr.  HOEFFEL)  yield SAWhour  YER). BILL Mr.  SAWYER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr. HOEFFEL) for yielding. Mr. Speaker,  in a  few days, or maybe a  little  longer, all of us will be heading home.  Most  of  us  will  be  flying.  will  be  driving.  And  for  the  first  time in  his  more  than  25  years  in  Congress, he  will  be  going  home  without  the  expectation  of  returning  for  the  long term. That will be sad  for all of us who have worked with him. He  has  provided  lessons  to  us  all  in more  ways  than  we  can  count.  I  want to  concentrate  on  just  one  though. When  most  of  us  go  home,  we  will  go home  by  getting  on  airplanes.  And  at some  point  before  that  plane  takes  off, there  will  be  a  flight  attendant  who comes  and  stands  before  us  and  announces  all  of  the  emergency  procedures  and will  say  that  in  the  unlikely event  of  an  emergency,  that  oxygen masks  will  deploy  from  the  compartment overhead. If we are traveling with children, they will tell us to put on our own oxygen mask  first and then put on those for the children. It  seems  kind  of  counterintuitive, those  of us who  care  as  deeply  as  all  of us  do  about  children.  We  do  not  think that  that  is  the  right  thing  to  do.  But in  the  end,  it  is,  of  course,  the  right thing  to  do,  because we  need  to  be  in  a position  to  take  care  of  those  children. Mr.  Speaker,  has  understood  that  in  a  way  that  has  borne itself out in policy across this Congress throughout  his  13  terms.  One  of  his proudest  accomplishments  I  am  sure  is the development of the Even Start program.  When  he  was  superintendent  at Spring  Grove  area  schools,  noticed  that  the  youngsters  who were  having  the  most  difficulty  in school  were  often  the  children  of  some former  students  who  had  also  not  performed  well  academically.  Working with  his  best  teachers,  he  developed  a program  which  would  provide  focused literacy  assistance  to  those  children and  to  their  parents  at  the  same  time, so that the parents could help reinforce the skills of the children. When  he  came  to  Congress,  he  developed  this  into  the Even Start program, which  has  been  a  model  of  what  it means for parents to be their children\u2019s first  and  most  important  teacher  by GOODLING GOODBILL BILL LING a  of  the skills  teacher,  GOODLING.  MCCARTHY)  BILL improving  the  academic  parents themselves. His  work  on  the  National  Literacy Act,  during  a  time  when  we  were  having  enormous  difficulty  getting  anything passed through this Congress, the National  Literacy  Act  was  the  only education  legislation  that  was  enacted into  law  during  that  session  of  Congress. Today,  the  Literacy  Involves  Family Together  Act,  the  LIFT  Act,  will  extend  his  literacy  legacy  into  the  21st century and beyond. The  truth  of  the matter  is  that  what the  gentlewoman  from New York  (Mrs. implied  is  a  vivid  truth  in If  one  has they  are  althe  life  of  ever  really  been  ways a teacher. Mr.  Speaker,  I  say  to  the  gentleman, We are learning from you still, BILL. Mr. HOEFFEL. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming  my  time,  I  thank  the  gentleman from Ohio for his eloquence. Mr.  Speaker,  those  of  us  in  vania are very proud of BILL I  would  simply  like  to  add  my  best wishes  to  him  and  my  congratulations to  him  for  his  long  and  illustrious  career  and  note  in  particular  with  my support  and  gratitude,  his  dedication to  the  concept  of  local  control  of  education. Every  time  we  try  in  Congress  to deal  with  educational  matters,  we  can be  accused  of  trying  to  interfere  somehow  with  the  very  valid  principle  of local control of education.  I  think  that Mr.  has  always  held  our  feet to  the  fire  as  an  institution  to  make sure we did not interfere with that. But he  has  supported  notable  legislation, like  the  Education  Flexibility  Act, which  gives  more  flexibility  locally, while  also  understanding  that  the  Federal  Government  has  a  significant  role to play in promoting public schools. I  think  that  got  that balance  just  about  right,  and  we  will remember  his  leadership  on  that,  and so many other educational issues, after he  has  left  these  halls,  but  certainly not  left  our memory. We  will  be  grateful to him for many years to come. GOODLING. GOODLING GOODLING PennsylBILL f hour  PETERSON)  BILL  GOODLING,  THE  MAN The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Under the Speaker\u2019s announced policy of January  19,  1999,  the  gentleman  from Pennsylvania  (Mr.  is  recognized  during  morning  debates  for 5 minutes. Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker,  today,  I  do  not  want  to  talk about  the  legislative  accomplishments of  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania (Mr.  I  want  to  talk  about the man. Mr. Speaker,  I  had  a  26-year  business career.  I  met  a  lot  of  business  leaders. I  was  fortunate  to  have  19  years  in State  government,  and  I  know  most  of Pennsylvania\u2019s leaders of today. This is my  fourth  year  here  in  Congress  and  I have  gotten  to  know  many  of  the  fine Members  of  this  body.  But  in my  view, is a class act. GOODLING).  GOODLING BILL LING BILL GOODGOODLING exemplifies  what  all Members  of  Congress  ought  to  be. First, he came here with experiences in a multitude of  fields. I think we are always  served  best  by  people  who  have succeeded  in  what  I  call  the  \u2018\u2018real world\u2019\u2019  and  then  come  to  government and  help  us  govern,  because  they  have the  wisdom  and  the  knowledge  from the fields they left. He  was  in  agriculture,  Pennsylvania\u2019s  leading  industry.  He  was  an  educator, a top flight educator. BILL is  the  kind  of  person  we  would like  to  have  as  a  neighbor,  as  a  business  partner,  as  a  personal  friend.  He not only  is competent and qualified; he is a fine human being. He is an example we  can  hold  up  to  our  young  people that  this  is  how  they  ought  to  live their  lives.  Be  successful  in  a  field  and then give back as he has given. Mr.  Speaker,  I  guess  what  has amazed  me  about  the  gentleman  from Pennsylvania,  and  it  is  unfortunate  he has to leave before we say these things, but he has been here 26 years. Today, in his  final weeks, he still has the passion of  his  convictions.  He  still  feels  passionately about local education and the importance of keeping the decisions locally. He  has  been  fighting  tenaciously in his  last weeks  in Congress espousing things he has been espousing  for a  long time, but with no  less gusto. Not many people do that. I  want  the  gentleman  to  know  that  I admire  him.  He  is  a  person  that  I  look up  to.  He  is  the  kind  of  person  that  I believe  exemplifies  what  we  all  ought to be, and we are going to miss him. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. PETRI). Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.  PETERSON) for yielding. Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  say  first  of  all that  I  know  that  my  colleague  from Wisconsin  and  a  long-time  member  of the  committee,  had wished that he could be here today as a Member  of  this  body  to  participate  in this occasion. Mr.  Speaker,  it  has  been  an  honor and  a  privilege  to  learn  about  education  at  the  knee  of BILL a true  expert  who  spent  his  life  the field. He will be sorely missed. It  is  with  immense  pleasure  and  honor  that I  rise  to  express  a  few  thoughts  about  my  colleague  and  good  friend,  I would  like  to  say  at  the  outset  that  I  know  that my  former  colleague  from  Wisconsin,  Steve Gunderson,  would  very  much  like  to  be  here today  to  participate  in  this  occasion.  He  is  a great admirer of Chairman GOODLING. The  Education  and  the  Workforce  Committee,  formerly  the  Education  and  Labor Committee,  was  blessed  the  day  was  first elected  to  Congress.  Drawing  on  his  experiences  as  a  coach,  a  high  school  principal,  and a  Superintendent  of  schools,  has  always approached  the  issue  of  education  with  the  interests  of  America\u2019s  children  at  heart.  I  can  remember  many  conversations  we  have  had, especially  in  the  days  when  we  had  adjoining offices  in  Rayburn,  discussing  ways  to  more effectively educate  the  children of his nation.

WILLIAM  GOODLING,  CHAIRMAN  OF  THE  COMMITTEE  ON  EDUCATION  AND  THE WORKFORCE (Mr.  FATTAH  asked  and  was  given permission  to  address  the  House  for  1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr.  FATTAH.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  seek the  opportunity  to  join  my  colleagues in saying a word for our party member, the  retiring  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania (Mr. GOODLING). I  have  had  the  opportunity  to  serve with  him  for  a  number  of  terms  as  he has  led  the  House  Committee  on  Education  and  the  Workforce.  His  work  in regard  to  improving  the  life  skills  and life  chances  of  millions  of  young  people, and in particular his work in developing  the  Even  Start  Program  and  his support  for  additional  resources  to  be provided  in  terms  of  special  education, are of particular note. I  join  with  my  colleagues  from  the State  of  Pennsylvania  and  many  of  us who  served  with  him  on  the  House Committee  on  Education  and  the Workforce  in  wishing  the  gentleman God speed in his retirement. f THE  FIRST  LADY  SHOULD  PUT TAXPAYERS\u2019  INTERESTS  AHEAD OF  PERSONAL  AMBITION (Mr. PITTS  asked  and was  given  permission  to  address  the  House  for  1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr.  PITTS.  Mr.  Speaker,  there  appears  to  be  a  double  standard  at  the White  House.  At  last  count,  the  First Lady\u2019s  campaign  for  the  U.S.  Senate has cost the taxpayers well over $1 million.  She  is  flying  around  the  Empire State in grand style using military aircraft,  full-time  Secret  Service  protection,  not  only  for  herself  but  also  for her  campaign  aides,  and  continues  to drag  her  feet  in  reimbursing  the  taxpayers. She has reimbursed the Treasury just over  $6,000  for  one  4-day  campaign  trip in August, but  in  reality,  this  trip  cost about  $60,000  as  they  flew  around  in  an Air  Force  C\u201320.  So  far  she  has  only  reimbursed  the  taxpayers  $185,000,  about 5 percent of what she owes. As  First  Lady,  Mrs.  Clinton  should get  the  same  security  and  security measures  that  previous  First  Ladies have had,  but  the  taxpayers  should not be  footing  the  bill  for  a  political  campaign for public office. The First Lady  should put  the American  taxpayers\u2019  interests  first  above  a personal desire for power. f ILLEGAL  DIAMOND  SALES  SUPPORT  BRUTAL  REBEL  GROUPS IN  SIERRA  LEONE (Mr.  EHLERS  asked  and  was  given permission  to  address  the  House  for  1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr.  EHLERS.  today  to  discuss  Mr.  Speaker,  a  very  serious  I  rise situain  the  Sierra Africa,  situation  tion  in  Leone. Last  week,  under  the  leadership  of the  gentleman  from  California  (Mr. ROYCE),  who  serves  as  chairman  of  the Subcommittee  on Africa, we had  a  special  meeting  or  hearing  at  which  we heard  from  victims  of  the  violence  in Africa. Just as an example, there were two 4year-old  children,  both  of  whom  had had  an  arm  chopped  off,  when  they were  2 years old, by  the  rebels. We also saw  a  student  who  had  said,  please, don\u2019t  chop  off  my  right  hand;  I  am  a student  and  I  have  to  write  with  it. They  chopped  off  his  right  hand.  Another  gentleman  had  both  arms chopped  off.  This  is  the  type  of  violence taking place. But  this  is not a political  revolution, this  is  a  revolution  of  bandits  who wanted  to  get  control  of  the  diamond mines,  and  in  fact,  they  have  achieved that. They are financing their war with the revenue from the mines. These  so-called  \u2018\u2018conflict  diamonds,\u2019\u2019 which  I  call  bloody  diamonds,  are  fueling  the  conflict  over  there,  and  many of those diamonds are being sold  in the United  States.  We  must  stop  the  importation of those diamonds. Our State Department  has  to  enforce international  law,  and  bring  pressure on Charles Taylor of Liberia and others to  stop  their meddling  in  the  affairs  of Sierra  Leone,  Above  all,  we  must  end the conflict. f SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT  BY  THE  PRO  TEMPORE The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. BASS).

Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask unanimous  consent  that  all  Members may  have  5  legislative  days  within which  to  revise  and  extend  their  remarks  and  include  extraneous  materials on H.R. 5139. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Is  there objection  to  the  request  of  the  gentleman from Arizona? There was no objection. Mr. STUMP. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr.  Speaker,  H.R.  5139 provides  for  the  conveyance  of  certain real  property  at  the  Carl  Vinson  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  Medical Center in Dublin, Georgia. Due  to  changes  in  the  way  health care  is  delivered,  the  VA  has  consolidated  its  health  care  in  the  central part  of  this  large  campus  in  Dublin. However,  it  continues  to  spend  hundreds of hours and  tens of  thousands of dollars  each  year  to  maintain  vacant buildings  and  grounds  on  this  campus. The  State  of  Georgia  has  identified two  uses  for  part  of  this  campus.  One part  would  be  used  to  expand  the  Middle  Georgia  College,  a  State-run  institution  of  higher  learning.  The  other ",

Americans  also  need  information  on  all  of the  treatment  options  available  to  them. Unfortunately,  I  have  learned  this  from  personal  experience. Last  January, my wife  received  the  life-altering  news  that  she  had  breast  cancer.  Despite her  annual  check-ups  and  mammograms,  our doctors  told  us  that  she  faced  undergoing  a radical  bilateral  mastectomy.  We  felt  extreme shock  that  the prognosis was  so drastic. However,  after  much  research  on  the  subject,  she  made  the  decision  that  this  was  indeed  the  best  option  for  her.  Her  surgery  was a  complete  success,  and  she  has  not  even  required  any  followup  chemotherapy  or  medication. So,  I  close  with  the  same  message\u2014We must  support  and  encourage  the  utilization  of all  of  the  modern-day  prevention,  detection and  treatment  options  available.  Our  experience  has  shown  us  that  this  is  essential  in  the battle against breast  cancer. Mr.  POMEROY.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  in strong  support  of  H.  Res.  278  and  in  honor  of the  millions  of  women  who  have  shown  the strength  and  courage  to  fight  back  against breast  cancer.  Breast  cancer  is  the  most  common  form  of  cancer  among  women  in  the United  States.  This  year,  almost  182,800  new cases  of  breast  cancer  will  be  diagnosed  and an  estimated  40,800  women  will  die  from  this terrible disease. Breast  cancer  touches  not  only  the  lives  of those  afflicted  with  the  disease,  but  also  their loved  ones.  Recently,  my  fellow  North  Dakotans  came  together  to  pray  for  a  courageous woman,  a  woman  who  has  dedicated  her  life to  improving  the  health  and  welfare  of  others. Heidi  Heitkamp,  our  state  Attorney  General, was  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer.  Like  so many  afflicted  with  this  disease,  however,  the strength,  determination,  and  sheer  will  that Heidi  has  displayed  through  this  most  difficult of  times  has  been  an  inspiration  to  her  family, friends and all who  know her. Mr.  Speaker,  the  story  of  Heidi  Heitkamp, like  that  of  so  many  other  women,  is  also  a story  of  hope.  Each  year,  the  number  of deaths  caused  by  breast  cancer  has  slowly fallen.  Increased  education  and  increased technology  has  extended  the  life  and  increased  the  survival  rate  of  those  afflicted with this  disease.  The  fight  against  breast  cancer can  be won.  I  call  on my  colleagues  to  join  the fight  by  increasing  funding  for  breast  cancer research,  increasing  access  to  screening  and treatment  options,  and  increasing  awareness. I  call  on  my  colleagues  to  fight  for  the  lives  of their mothers,  sisters and other  loved ones. Mr.  GILMAN.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  in support  of  H.  Res.  278,  which  expresses  the sense  of  the  House  that  all  Americans,  and above  all women,  should  take  an  active  role  in the  fight  against  breast  cancer  by  using  all  the means  available  to  them,  including  regular clinical  and  self-examinations,  regular  mammograms, and biopsies. By  calling  for  greater  awareness  and  education  for  all  women,  may  will  benefit  from early  detection  and  by  following  up  a  screening  with  medical  treatment,  fewer  women  will succumb  to  this devastating disease. Mr.  Speaker,  this  issue  is  especially  important  to  me  and  to  my  constituents,  especially those  in  Rockland  County.  Recent  studies have  found  that  Rockland  County  has  the highest  rate  of  breast  cancer  in  New  York State  and  according  to  some  studies,  in  the Nation.  This  legislation  will  help  inform  many of  my  constituents  of  how  they  can  take  an active  role  in  the  flight  against  breast  cancer. Moreover,  this  resolution  applauds  and  recognizes  the  role  played  by  national  and  community  organizations  and  health  care  providers  in promoting  awareness  of  the  importance  of regular  clinical  and  self-examinations,  regular mammograms,  and  biopsies  and  in  providing information,  support,  and  access  to  services.  I strongly  support  this  legislation  and  urge  my colleagues  to  fund  support  this measure. Mr.  COBURN.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  back the balance of my time. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.

The  Chair  recognizes  the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COBURN). 1130 Mr.  COBURN.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker,  prior  to  coming  to Congress,  I  had  a  full-time  practice  in  obstetrics  and  family  medicine;  and  it was not uncommon that 50 to 200 times a  year  I  would  diagnose  cervical  cancer,  and  over  the  15  years  in  practice prior  to  coming  here,  what  I  saw  was an  ever-increasing  number  of  people who  were  being  diagnosed  with  either cancer or pre-cancer of their cervix. What  we  have  come  to  know  on  the science  of  this  is  this  is  all  caused  by one  virus,  different  strains  of  the  same virus.  Squamous  carcinoma  of  the  cervix  is  rarely  caused  by  anything  other than  human  papilloma  virus.  What  we have  today  is  a  bill  to make  awareness of  this  issue  for women  in our  country. I  want  to  thank  the  gentlewoman from  California  (Ms.  for  her  work  in  this  area, and  also  in  the  area  of  HIV  and  her care  for  those  most  affected  by  this. Raising  the  awareness  of  the  high  risk of cervical cancer is important not just to  the  more  mature  women  in  our country,  but  also  to  the  young  women in our country. Along  with  that  comes  the  very  sad fact  that  our  institutions  that  we should  be  trusting  in  this  area  have failed  us.  The  Center  for  Disease  Control has failed, because the full name of the  Center  for  Disease  Control  is  the Center  for Disease Control  and Prevention.  The  NIH  has  released  a  statement,  as well  as NCI,  and  on  their Web site  you  can  find  that  this  disease  is caused  by  human  papilloma  virus  and that  a  condom  fails  to  protect.  We  are so  sold  on  this  concept  of  \u2018\u2018safe  sex\u2019\u2019  in this  country  that  we  refuse  to  accept the  etiology  and  pathogenesis  of  this disease,  and  we  refuse  to  be  honest with  the  American  public  in  that  a condom cannot protect them from this. The  thing  that  is  exciting  to  me about  this  resolution  coming  up  is  it perhaps will have some honesty coming MCDONALD)  MILLENDER",

This  is an opportunity  that  will  probably  come once  in a  lifetime. In all the years that I  have  served  in  this  body,  never  once have I seen an opportunity of this magnitude  to  do  good  for  Americans,  for conservation,  for  fish  and  wildlife  that matched  this.  And  never  once  have  I seen anything which did so much to realize  the  hopes  and  the  ideals  of  those of us who love the out-of-doors. Now,  I  have  no  doubt  that  the  language  contained  in  the  Interior  appropriation bill and this land conservation program  was  drafted  with  the  best  of intentions.  It  is again,  I note, an  effort by  my  good  friends  on  the  Committee on  Appropriations  to  legislate  well. And part of that legislating well is preserving  the  jurisdiction  of  that  committee  and  part  of  it  is  in  sidetracking CARA,  something  which  that  committee  found  to  be  highly  offensive,  as we  had  this  legislation  on  the  floor  at an  earlier  time,  because  it  did  take away  from  the  Committee  on  Appropriations  the  ability  to  function  by whim  and  caprice,  to  deny  new  conservation  money  and,  in  effect,  to  supplant the efforts of the legislative committees around here which are strongly and  deeply  and  sincerely  conversed  in this. The  premise  of  CARA  was  to  take Federal  resource  revenues  from  the Outer  Continental  Shelf  to  reinvest them  for  conservation  purposes. And  it was  originally  intended, when  the Congress  passed  the  Land  and  Water  Conservation  Fund  in  the  1960s,  that  this would  be  done.  Since  that  time,  the Committee  on  Appropriations  has  had the  opportunity  to  do  the  kinds  of things  we  are  talking  about  today. Without  the  pressure  of  CARA,  they never would have done them. So I say let us assist our good friends on  the  Committee  on  Appropriations. Let  us  help  them.  Let  us  see  to  it  that we have an opportunity, if we are going to  legislate,  to  legislate  well.  Vote  the rule  down.  A  new  rule  can  be  brought back,  and  we  can  have  a  full  opportunity then to address all of the important  questions  that  exist  with  regard to  conservation,  and  with  regard  to spending  proper  levels  of  funds  to  save and  protect  open  spaces  and  the  conservation  and  environmental  values that  are  so  important  to  this  country. The  language  of  the  conference  report  is quite  clear.  It  says  the program is  not  mandatory  and  does  not  guarantee  annual  appropriations.  If  Members  need  a  reason  to  vote  against  this rule  so  that  they  can  vote  for  something which  is  of more  lasting  and  permanent  character,  this  is  the  reason right here. This is what the Committee on Appropriations  is  saying  to  us. This is  not  permanent.  I  am  sure  that  they have  the  best  of  intentions  at  this time,  but  within  a  year  there  will  be new  pressures  upon  the  Committee  on Appropriations  which  will  tell  the Committee  on  Appropriations  that they  should  perhaps  cavil  just  a  little bit on the commitment that they make with  less and  come  forward  today  money. Now,  they  will  tell  us  about  the  violent  crime  reduction  trust  fund.  That expired  the other day, and  it was never fully  funded.  They  have  always  told  us what  a  great  thing  it  was.  And  it  was great,  and  I  commend  them  for  it.  But it  did  not  come  through  a  legislative committee  and  it  did  not  have  the  supervision  and  the  care  and  the  attention that goes to it. And it also was not as  fully  honored  as  it  could  have  been and  should have been. Certainly we are going  to  meet  the  same  situation, where  the  Committee  on  Appropriations  will  shave  conservation  values just  is  a  little  here  and  just  a  little there, because it is easy to do when the pressures  are  on  to  expend  monies  for other purposes. Again,  I  announce my  respect  for my good  friends,  the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin  (Mr.  OBEY),  the  gentleman  from Washington (Mr. DICKS), the gentleman from  Ohio  (Mr.  and  my  colleagues  on  the  Committee  on  Appropriations; but they are not meeting the real  challenges  of  greatness.

Mr.  HASTINGS  of  Washington.  Mr. Speaker,  I  yield  2  minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  North  Carolina  (Mr. REGULA),  BALLENGER). Mr.  for  Speaker,  I yielding  me Mr.  BALLENGER.  thank  the  gentleman  this time. Today, we have an opportunity  to  reward  an  agency  which  has  completely turned  itself around. For  the  first  time in  over  8  years,  we  have  the  chance  to give  the  National  Endowment  for  the Arts  a  small  increase.  It  should  be noted that this  increase  is dedicated to grants such as Challenge America. Challenge  America  is  an  opportunity to  serve  smaller  communities  around the  United  States.  Sixty  percent  of Challenge  America  grants  will  be  distributed  to  communities  under  200,000 in  population  in  all  50  States.  The  intent  of  this  program  is  to  reach  previously  unserved  communities  in  the same  way  that  ArtsREACH  programs work. My  colleagues may  recall  that  in  the first 2 years of ArtsREACH grants were made  to  the  123  mostly  new  communities,  including  places  like  Ft. Washakie,  Wyoming;  Deadwood,  South Dakota; and Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The remaining 40 percent of the Challenge  America  grants  will  be  passed through  the  56  State  and  Territorial arts  agencies  in  keeping  with  the  congressional  practice  of  splitting  NEA funds  between  State  and  national  programs. These  new  grant  initiatives  are  part of  a  new  NEA  which  supports  projects in  over  4,000  locations  in  the  country. Today,  NEA  is  doing  more  for  communities  in  need  than  ever  before,  and  I urge  my  colleagues  to  pass  this  bill but monua minimal  which  gives NEA  mental increase. Ms.  SLAUGHTER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I yield  2 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN). Mr.  JOHN.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  in  opposition  to this  conference  report. With  all  due  respect  to  the  gentleman  from Wisconsin and  the  gentleman  from  Washington, my  friends  on  this  side  of  the  aisle  and the  other  side  of  the  aisle,  who  have done  a  pretty  good  job  putting  a  piece of legislation that is controversial year to  year  on  the  floor  before  us,  we  have heard  other  speakers  before  me  say that this is not CARA and I can tell my colleagues that this is not CARA. The  energy  behind  the  Conservation and  Reinvestment  Act,  H.R.  701,  is about  one  thing,  it  is  about  permanency.  It  is  about  making  sure  that they  can  plan  for  the  future.  Coastal programs,  ball  parks,  conservation, wildlife  management  programs,  they can all function if they know that they are  going  to  have  a  revenue  stream that  is  certain  from  year  to  year. That is  the  energy  behind  CARA  and  why 3,000 groups supported this piece of legislation  and  300  Members  of  the  House voted for it. Let me  remind my  colleagues  that  it is  not  CARA,  if  I  take  just  an  excerpt of  the  conference  report  of  the  Interior bill  that  we  are  voting  on  today  in  the rule,  and  see  where  it  says  this  program  is  not  mandatory  and  does  not guarantee  annual  appropriations.  That is  obviously  what  they  have  meant  because  they  put  it  in  black  and  white. Well,  that  undermines,  I  believe,  and unravels  the  energy  and  the  excitement  behind  a  piece  of  legislation  that is,  I  believe,  one  of  the  greatest  pieces of legislation that we have had. We  have  a  wonderful  opportunity here.  The  year  is  2000.  We  have  surpluses  that  we  are  dealing  with.  We have  the  greatest  opportunity,  I  believe,  in  our  lifetime  to  put  in  permanent  funding  for building ball parks, to save  our  coastline  in  Louisiana.  We talk  about  an  energy  policy  and  the suspect  of  time  that  we  are  entering into with  oil  and  gas  prices. Well, Louisiana,  which  produces  80  percent  of that, is eroding. I  firmly  believe  that  we  still  have time  for  CARA.  Let  us  not  go  forward with  the  rule  that  halfway  gets  us  to where  we  need  to  go.  I  urge  my  colleagues to oppose the rule. Mr.  HASTINGS  of  Washington.  Mr. Speaker,  I  yield  2  minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Washington  (Mr. NETHERCUTT).

The  bill  also  provides  $8  million  for the  Northeast  Home  Heating  Oil  Reserve,  and  people  are  going  to  be  very grateful  for  that  because  the  cost  of heating  homes,  offices,  and  businesses this  winter  will  be  less  expensive  as  a result of that provision in this bill, Mr. Speaker. The  administration  and  the  House Senate  negotiators  eliminated  the most  egregious  antienvironmental  riders, and they scaled back those that remain in the bill. The  Land  Conservation  Preservation and  Infrastructure  Improvement  Program  provides  a  historic  $12  billion over  6  years  for  high-priority  Federal and  State  conservation  and  preservation  programs,  a  wonderful  contribution. This  proposal  actually  improves  on CARA  by  getting  rid  of  the  environmentally  harmful  provisions  that would  have  encouraged  new  offshore drilling,  would  have  allowed  coastal funding  to  be used  for  environmentally damaging  activities,  and  impose  burdensome  new  restrictions  on  Federal land  acquisitions.  All  that  has  been taken out  in this terrific piece of  legislation. Twelve  distinguished  environmental conservation  and  historic  preservation groups recognize the importance of this bill  when  they  said  as  follows:  \u2018\u2018This important  and  historic  conservation initiative  represents  a  major  contribution  to  the  effort  to  protect  what  remains  of  our  irreplaceable  natural  heritage before it is lost.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my colleagues  that,  in  the  6  years  that  the gentleman  from Ohio  (Mr. REGULA) has chaired this subcommittee, he has done an  outstanding  job.  I  can  only  thank him  for  that  on  behalf  of  my  constituents  and  all  the  people  of  this  country. I  only  regret  that  his  party  put  in place  these  term  limitations  because the  kind  of  leadership  that  he  has  provided  has  been  absolutely  outstanding, and  he  is  going  to  be  a  great  loss.  I know  he  is  going  to  continue  to  be  on the committee, I certainly hope so; and we  will  have  the  benefit  of  his  wisdom in  that  sense.  I  thank  the  gentleman from Ohio. I  thank  the  gentleman  from  Washington  (Mr.  DICKS),  our  ranking  member  on  the  subcommittee,  for  the  outstanding work that he has done, for the hard-fought  contentious  battles  that he was engaged in to make certain that this  bill  is  the  kind  of  bill  that  every Member  of  this  House  can  be  proud  of The  DICKS)  how  much I  reserve REGULA)  REGULA)  Speaker,  American  and  every  grateful for. Mr.  DICKS.  Mr.  time is remaining? The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. LAHOOD).  The  gentleman  from  Ohio (Mr.  has  91\u20442 minutes  remaining.  gentleman  from  Washington (Mr.  has  111\u20442 minutes  remaining. Mr.  REGULA.  Mr.  Speaker,  the balance of my time. Mr.  DICKS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  2 minutes  to  the  distinguished  gentleman  from  California  (Mr.  FARR),  a member  of  the  Committee  on  Appropriations  and  a  person  who  cares  deeply  about  natural  resource  issues  in  our country. Mr. FARR of California. Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the  gentleman  from  Washington  (Mr. DICKS)  for  yielding me  this time.  I thank the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr.  for  bringing  this  bill  to the floor. Many  of  us  came  to  Washington, came  to  this  House  hoping  that  we could better use the national resources, the  national  treasure  that  we  have  to help preserve local initiatives in trying to build more livable communities. 1400 In  thinking  about  it,  I  am  sure  my colleagues  will  agree  that  the  most beautiful  communities  in  the  United States  are  usually  the  most  economically  successful.  So  economic  development  goes  hand-in-hand  with  environmental  protection  or  land  stewardship, and  this  is  the  bill  for  the  first  time  in history  that allows  this  relationship  to truly work. I  am  here  to  applaud,  to  thank  and praise  my  colleagues.  For  the  first time  since  the  inception  of  the  Land and  Water  Conservation  Fund  in  1965, these  funds  are  now  earmarked  for  the purpose  they  were  originally  intended. That  means  they  cannot  be  used  for other  purposes.  Historically,  in  Congress,  every  time we  had  another  problem, we would dip into that pot and use those  funds.  This  committee  changed that, and I thank them. The  people  that  will  really  thank this  committee  and  this  Congress  is every  county  in  the  United  States, every State in the United States, every community  that  now  has  a  lot  of  passion  about  trying  to  work  in  environmental  stewardship  because  they  now have  a  new  partner,  and  that  partner will  be  the  Federal  Government,  in  a lot  of  different  programs.  Certainly every employee of the BLM, and people who  follow  the  Bureau  of  Land  Management;  every  employee  of  the  U.S. Forest  Service,  of  the  United  States Park Service, of the U.S. Wildlife Service, and the refuges  that they help protect will benefit. I  just want to conclude, Mr. Speaker, by  thanking  the  gentleman  from  Ohio (Mr. REGULA). I have served in the Congress  with  him  and  know  him  very well,  and  he  is  truly  one  of  the  leaders that  people  have  talked  about.  Things DICKS)  REGULA)  NADLER),  do not get done  in politics unless  there is  leadership.  I  want  to  thank  all  my colleagues,  all  the  names  that  have been mentioned here today, because all America  benefits.  It  takes  leadership to  lift  the  political  tide,  and  those Members  have  lifted  that  political  tide forever. Mr.  DICKS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  2 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  New York  (Mr.  one  of  the  strongest  supporters  of  the  Interior  appropriation  bill,  and  in  particular  the  National Endowment for the Arts. Mr.  NADLER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  in support  of  this  bill,  and  I  want  to  join my  colleagues  in  applauding  the  role played by the outgoing chairman of the subcommittee,  the  gentleman  from Ohio  (Mr.  and  also  the  role played  by  the  gentleman  from  Washington  (Mr.  and  the  gentleman from  Wisconsin  (Mr.  OBEY),  as  well  as the others in producing this bill. This  bill,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  far  better than  the version  this House passed  last June  and  is  free  of  the most  objectionable  provisions  of  that  bill.  I  am  disappointed  it  does  not  contain  the  Conservation  and  Reinvestment  Act  as  it was  passed  by  the  House,  but  I  understand  the  reasons  for  it.  This  bill  does greatly  increase  protections  for  open spaces,  but  I  hope  we  will  revisit  the CARA, which would provide even greater protections. At  the  same  time,  I  strongly  support the  modest  increase  provided  to  the arts  and  humanities  in  this  bill.  Most notably,  at  long  last,  the  National  Endowment  for  the  Arts  will  receive  a well-deserved  and  much-needed  increase. The  modest  increase  included  in  this bill  would  not  ordinarily  be  cause  for celebration,  but  when  its  comes  to  the NEA,  it  is  historic.  Given  the  unfortunate  record  this Congress  has  produced over  the  last  6  years  and  the  parliamentary  chicanery  we  witnessed earlier  this  year,  it  is  a  major  victory for  supporters  of  the  arts  and  humanities.  With  this  increase,  we  have turned  a  corner  in  our  debate  on  the arts. Just  a  few  years  ago,  we  were  debating whether the NEA should be allowed to continue to exist; whether it was the proper  role  of  government  to  subsidize the  arts.  But  this  increase  is  an  acknowledgment  that  those  of  us  who support government subsidy to the arts have won that fight. The American people believe the Federal  Government  has  a  role  in  cultivating  the  arts  and  humanities  and that we must increase our commitment in  this  area.  With  this  increase,  the NEA  will  be  able  to  continue  its  mission  to  reach  those  parts  of  the  country  that  have  not  historically  received grants. The  appropriators  should  be  hailed for  increasing  our  commitment  to  arts education and community activity programs.  They  have  also  increased  our support  for  the  humanities  and  many cultural  institutions.  This  is  truly  a victory for the cultural community. ",

So because of that difference, what is really  on  the  table  is  up  to  $80  billion in  additional  spending.  The  problem  is no  one  knows  what  the  plans  are  for using  that  huge  amount  of  money.  So we  are  asked  to  approve  a  bill  at  a time. I voted against the Energy-Water bill because  I did not know whether we ought  to  be  providing  that  much money  in  that  bill  when  we  still  did not  know  what  the  other  bills  were going to look like. So we are drifting along with no  idea of  what  the  limits  are,  no  context,  no limits,  no  discipline,  someone  in  the leadership  office  having  some  idea  of what  the  game  plan  is.  That  changes from  day  to  day.  But  we  do  not  know so we  cannot  tell our  constituents, and the press certainly does not know. So  in  the  end,  we  will  do  what  about six anonymous people  in the  leadership office  tells  us  will  be  done,  but  that  is not  the way we ought  to  run a  railroad or  a  legislative  body.  We  ought  to  be able  to  know  what  the  limits  are  so that we can choose within those limits. That  is  not  a  privilege  which  is  being afforded  us.  There  is  not  much  we  can do  about  that  on  the  minority  side  of the aisle. But it is an irresponsible way to run what is supposed to be the greatest legislative body in the world. Mr.  Speaker,  is  the  gentleman  Florida  (Mr.  going  to  back? Mr.  YOUNG  of  Florida.  Mr.  Speaker, I will yield back after  I make a closing statement. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I have no requests  for  time,  and  I  yield  back  the balance of my time. Mr.  YOUNG  of  Florida.  Mr.  Speaker, I  yield myself  such  time  as  I may  consume. Mr.  Speaker,  I  appreciate  the  indication  of  support  for  the  CR.  The  gentleman  from  Wisconsin  (Mr.  OBEY)  is exactly  right.  We  have  to  do  this  from the  institutional  standpoint. So we  are going to pass this CR today. I  listened  to  the  gentleman  from Maryland  (Mr. HOYER), one of the more articulate  members  of  this  Congress.  I would  have  to  say  that  I  agree with  an awful  lot  of  what  he  said.  Our  budget process  is  less  than  perfect. But  I want to  make  sure  that  everybody  understands  that  the  budget  process  is  just one piece of the process. The appropriations  process  is  something  entirely  different, although it might seem to some that  they  are  both  one  and  the  same; but they are not. But,  unfortunately,  the  appropriations  process  becomes  captive  to  the budget  process  on  occasion,  and we  are not  the  masters  of  our  own  destiny sometimes when  it comes to the appropriations process. But  we  have  done  a  House.  The  House  can  good  job  be  proud  from yield YOUNG)  the the in  of  fact  that, yes,  in  fact we did pass all of our  bills,  and  we  passed  them  fairly early.  In  fact,  all  13  bills  were  passed before  the  end  of  July,  except  for  D.C., The  D.C.  bill  was  actually  on  the  floor in  July  but  was  pulled  off  the  floor  for some  other  measure  that  apparently had  more  importance  at  one  point  or another. Also, we have passed, in terms of conference  reports,  through  the  House  the Defense conference report, the Military Construction  conference  report,  the Energy  and  Water  conference  report, the  Treasury-Postal  conference  report, the  Legislative  Branch  conference  report,  and  the  Interior  conference  report, which we passed just a short time ago today. We have completed the conference on the  Transportation  appropriations  bill this  morning.  At  4  o\u2019clock  this  afternoon,  we  will  convene  a  conference meeting on  the Agricultural appropriations bill. So  we  are  moving  on  our  responsibility,  but  we,  in  the  House,  are  only one-third  of  the  players.  The  other body  is  a  player  and  the  President  of the  United  States  is  a  player.  When  it gets  to  the  point  that  bills  are  sent  to the  President,  and  we  do  not  know what he is going to do on some of these bills,  he  becomes  as  powerful  as  twothirds  of  this  House  and  two-thirds  of the Senate. Because  if  he  vetoes  one  of our  bills,  it  takes  two-thirds  of  both Houses to override the veto. So  we  try  to  work  together.  I  think what we  saw  earlier  today  on  the  Interior  appropriations  bill  was  an  indication  of  how,  if  we  work  together,  both sides,  the  majority,  the  minority,  understanding  that  there  are  strong  differences, to resolve those differences, it is  amazing  what  we  can  accomplish.  I am  really  proud  of  the  House  for  the strong vote that we received for the Interior bill just a short time ago. So  Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  essential  that we  pass  this  CR  today,  and  I  again  appreciate those statements  from the minority,  from  the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin  (Mr.  OBEY),  recognizing  that  it is  important  to pass  the CR  today  that would  keep  the  government  operating to  the  14th  of  October.  Hopefully  by then  we  will  have  much  more  positive and constructive news to report. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The  SPEAKER  pro  LAHOOD).  All  time  for  pired.

It  is  currently  estimated  that  there are  between  800,000  and  1  million needlesticks  and  other  sharps  injuries to  healthcare  workers  in  the  United states  each  year.  An  average  hospital incurs  approximately  30  worker needlestick  injuries  per  100  beds  per year.  These  numbers  are  alarming,  especially  since  the  technology  exists  to prevent these injuries. Many  of  these  accidents  are  instant tragedies,  infecting  dedicated  medical workers  with  blood-borne  diseases, sometimes  even  the  incurable  AIDS virus.  And  ALL  of  these  needlesticks leave  the  victim  frightened  of  the  consequences  until  a  blood  test  can  be done  to  determine  whether  they  have been infected. The  least  we  can  do  is  see  that  medical  professionals  have  the  latest  in safety  precautions  available  to  them. We cannot prevent all hospital and doctor\u2019s  office  accidents,  but  we  should prevent  those  we  can.  Today\u2019s  safety needles  are  lifesavers  for  those  trying to save lives. We need to encourage the use  of  safe  needles  and  devices  to  improve  healthcare  worker  safety  in  the workplace. Numerous  studies have demonstrated that  the  use  of  safe-needle  devices, when  they  are  part  of  an  \u2018\u2018overall\u2019\u2019 bloodborne  pathogens  risk-reduction program,  are  extremely  effective  in  reducing accidental needlesticks.  In  fact, the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and Prevention estimates that 76 percent of needlestick  injuries  could  be  eliminated  immediately  if  health  care  institutions  switched  to  safe  needles  and similar devices. We  should be doing  everything  possible  to  encourage  the  use of safe technology. Not  only  does  the  use  of  safe  technology  save  lives\u2014it  also  saves money. For  example,  it  is  estimated  that  for  a 300 bed hospital to convert to safe technology,  it  would  cost  $70,000  a  year. When  you  compare  that  amount  to  the estimated  $500,000  in  testing  and  drug regimens  for  just  one  needlestick  injury, it becomes clear\u2014needlestick prevention  makes  practical  and  fiscal sense.  And  this  does  not  begin  to  include  the  emotional  toll  of  the  injured worker  or  the  countless  lawsuits  filed. The  use  of  safe  technology  should  be viewed  as  an  insurance  policy:  an  insurance policy for workers and patients and an insurance policy for hospitals. Mr.  Speaker,  I  commend  Mr. and  Mr.  for  their leadership  on  this  important  issue.  I also  would  like  to  commend  forwardthinking  companies  like  Becton-Dickinson  of  Bergen  County,  New  Jersey, for  their  contribution  to  the  development of this safe technology. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important legislation. Mr.  OWENS.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my  friend,  the  gentleman  from  New York  (Mr.  OWENS),  for  yielding  me  the time. Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  in  support  of  this legislation.  I  want  to  congratulate  the gentleman  from  North  Carolina  (Mr. and  the  gentleman  from New  York  (Mr.  OWENS),  my  friend,  for their  intelligence  in  bringing  this  to the floor. There  are  a  lot  of  competing  interests in this legislation, union and management,  health  care  providers  and product  providers,  and  it  was  a  substantial  task  to  bring  all  of  those  parties  together.  The  gentleman  from North  Carolina  (Mr.  and the  gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr. took  the  lead  in  doing  that, thank  them  and  commend  them BALLENGER)  OWENS)  and  I  for it. The  comCLAY) OWENS)  OWENS)  GOODLING)  gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr. said  in  his  remarks  that  it  is not  an  overstatement  to  say  that  this legislation  will  save  peoples\u2019  lives;  he is right. There are instances where people  are  injured  and  sometimes  fatally injured  as  a  result  of  injuries  on  the job that will be prevented as a result of passing this legislation. This  is  what  we  are  here  to  do,  to bring the two parties together and both sides  of  the  bargaining  table  to  make this  happen.  I  know  the  gentleman from  New  York  (Mr.  in  particular  has  been  tenacious  in  pursuing this  legislation  for  many  numbers  of years,  and  on  behalf  of  my  constituents, I thank him for it. I  also  thank  the  gentleman  from Pennsylvania  (Mr.  and  the gentleman  from  Missouri  (Mr.  for  their  leadership  of  the  full  mittee in bringing us here. I  first  heard  about  this  legislation when members of the health care team, nurses,  mainly,  at  the  Camden  County Health  Services  Center  in  my  district visited  me  in  my  office  here,  they  are members  of  the  AFSCME  union,  and they  had  called  it  to  the  attention  of their  employer  to  voluntarily  adopt  a standard like this, which the employer, to  its  credit,  did.  That  was  then  followed  up  here  at  the  national  level  by any  number  of  groups  and  interests  to make sure that we could codify this effort  by  OSHA  to  balance  the  concerns of  union  and  management,  to  balance all  concerns  and  to  write  a  good  bill.  I believe that we have done that. I  also  appreciate  the  way  that  this bill  incorporates  technological  changes and  does  not  wed  itself  to  any  particular  technology.  I  applaud  that,  because  I  believe  that  it  will  permit  the development  and  evolution  of  even greater technologies as time goes by. Mr.  Speaker,  I  also  applaud  the  fact that  the  bill  reflects  my  own  understanding  that  a  device  that  does  not use  needles  for  the  securement  of  devices  for  administration  of  medication or  fluids  and  thereby  diminishes  or BALLENGER)  BALLENGER)  eliminates  exposure  to  bloodborne pathogens  clearly  falls  within  the  definition  of  a  device  that  does  not  use needles  for any other procedure  involving  the  potential  for  occupational  exposure  to  bloodborne  pathogens  due  to the  injuries  from  contaminated  sharps. I  think  I  followed  that,  not  being  a medical  professional.  In  other  words, that OSHA can  find  the very best technology  available  in  any  given  time  in the  future  to  protect  workers,  that  is what we are here to do. Mr.  Speaker,  I  again  thank  the  gentleman  from  North  Carolina  (Mr. and  the  gentleman  from New York  (Mr. OWENS).  I  rise  in  enthusiastic  support  of  the  legislation  and urge its unanimous approval. Mr.  BALLENGER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I yield  2 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. BARRETT). Mr.  BARRETT  of  Nebraska.  Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the  gentleman  from North  Carolina  (Mr.  for yielding  me  this  time,  and  I  compliment him as well, the job that he did in bringing this bill to the floor. And  I  certainly  am  pleased  to  join with  my  colleagues  in  total  support  of H.R.  5178,  the  Needlestick  Safety  and Prevention  Act.  I  think  this  is  one  of the  major  public  health  issues  facing the  health  care  community  today,  and I  think  it  certainly  deserves  the  attention of the Congress. According  to  the  Department  of Labor,  as  has  already  been  mentioned, there  are  an  estimated  800,000 needlestick  injuries which  occur  in  the United  States  each  year,  and  this  puts thousands  of  health  care  workers  including  nurses  and  doctors  and  CNAs and even custodians at the risk of accidental  exposure  to more  than  20 pathogens,  including  HIV  and  Hepatitis  B and  C.  In  addition  to  protecting  health care  workers,  Congress  should  be  concerned  about  protecting  every  patient admitted  to  a  hospital  or  treated  at  a clinic, because patients are also at risk of an accidental needlestick injury. A very crucial component of the comprehensive  prevention  program  is  the use  of  the  so-called  safe  needles.  These are needles designed to retract into the body of the syringe once it is used so it can  then  be  disposed  of  with  a  much lower  chance  of  an  accidental needlestick. A  company  in my  district, Becton-Dickinson  is  a  leading  manufacturer  of  these  devices,  and  I  am pleased  that  a  company  with  Nebraska ties  can  play  a  role  in  addressing  this very important public health concern. For the safety of health care workers and  patients,  this  very  important  public  health  issue  should  not  be  overlooked.  And  I  certainly  extend  my  full support to the bill and urge its passage. Mr.  OWENS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield such  time  as  he  may  consume  to  the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMPSON).

Rate-ofreturn  regulation  would  allow  such  carriers to raise rates on other customers sufficiently to  maintain  the  authorized  level  of  return while  they  lower  prices  for  contract  customers. This  pricing  deregulation  is  not  going  to  affect  directly  any  consumer  in  my  congressional  district,  but  I  would  suggest  to  the  rural members  of  the  House  that  they  may  want  to take  another  look  at  this  pricing  deregulation and  refine  it  further  because  I  believe\u2014and the  FCC  clearly  believes\u2014that  it  runs  the  risk of  allowing  unnecessary  and  unjustified  price hikes. The  second  issue  I  want  to  highlight  is  the merger  review  section.  This  section  states  that any  review  involving  a  so-called  2  percent  carrier  must  be  approved  or  denied  by  the  condition within  60  days.  I  understand  that  the  companies  do  not  want  merger  reviews  to  drag  on for  years,  but  I  would  suggest  that  60  days  is too  short and unrealistic. While  I  believe  the  Commission  is  itself streamlining  its  process,  if  the  majority  is  insistent  on  having  a merger  review  \u2018\u2018shot  clock\u2019\u2019 I  would  suggest  giving  the  Commission  a greater  period  of  time.  In  addition,  at  our merger  review  hearing  Commissioner  Powell made  what  I  thought  was  a  reasonable  suggestion.  He  noted  that  often  companies  will amend  their  initial  applications,  often  late  in  a review  and  after  public  comment.  He  suggested  some  flexibility  for  the  FCC  to  extend the  review. I  would  suggest,  therefore,  something  that would  allow  a  one-time  extension  if  a  majority of  the  Commission  voted  to  extend  the  review\u2014of  if  the  filing  company  itself  requested an  extension.  I  think  this  is  a more  reasonable way  to  proceed  because  in  my  view  60  days is  frankly  too  short  a  time  and  does  not  sufficiently protect  the public  interest. I  hope  we  can  continue  our  dialogue  about these  issues  and  others  and  make  additional changes  as  we  proceed  on  this  bill  in  the  future. Thank  you. Mr.  GORDON.

Madam  Speaker,  I  yield myself such times as I may consume. Madam  Speaker,  I  rise  in  support  of House  Concurrent  Resolution  133, which  recognizes  the  importance  of preventing  deaths  from  colorectal  cancer.  Colorectal  cancer  is  the  second most common cause of cancer deaths in the  United  States.  About  56,500  people die  from colorectal cancer each year  in the  United  States.  The  chance  of  cure is  clearly  related  to  the  stage  of  the disease.  Early  cancers  have  an  excellent  prognosis,  while  advanced  cancers have a poor prognosis. Often, colorectal cancer does not give any  symptoms  until  rather  late  in  the disease. I have been touched personally by  this  disease,  having  lost  a  dear friend  to  the  disease,  when  had  it  been diagnosed  earlier,  surely  it  would  have been  curable.  By  screening  for colorectal  cancer,  cancers  can  be  detected at a very early stage, when they are clearly curable. Several  studies  have  shown  that screening  for  colorectal  cancer  by checking for blood in the stools reduces death  in  these  cancer  patients  by  15  to 30  percent.  Screening  for  colorectal cancer  is  now  recommended  in  the United  States  for  all  people  over  50 years  or  older  without  any  symptoms of  colorectal  disease  and  no  other  risk factors. Colorectal  cancer  screening  is  an area  in which  the House  Committee  on Commerce  has  been  very  active.  Under changes  made  in  1997,  the  Medicare program authorized coverage of and established  frequency  limits  for colorectal  cancer  screening  tests.  As  a part of our work with the House leadership  in  coming  up  with  a  Medicare package  we  can  all  be  proud  of,  the Committee  on  Commerce  reported  out provisions  in H.R.  5291,  the Beneficiary Improvement  and  Protection  Act,  that would give consumers more choices and control in the kind of colorectal cancer screening services they can choose. The provision  would  permit  an  individual to  elect  to  receive  a  screening colonoscopy,  which  is  more  expensive but more thorough, instead of a screening sigmoidoscopy. There  are many  other  fine  provisions in  H.R.  5291  that  would  go  a  long  way to  improving  the  life  for  those  Americans  on  Medicare  facing  an  uncertain future of colorectal cancer. Madam  Speaker,  I  thank  the  cosponsors  of  House  Concurrent  Resolution 133  for  their  leadership  on  this  issue and in cancer awareness in general, and I  urge  my  colleagues  to  pass  this  resolution on the floor today. Madam  Speaker,  I  reserve  ance of my time. Mr.  BROWN  of  Ohio.  er,  I  yield  myself  such  consume. Madam  Speaker,  colon  and  rectal cancers are  the  second  leading cause of cancer-related  deaths  in  the  United States.  This  year  alone,  more  than 130,000  Americans  will  be  diagnosed with  colon  cancer  and  colorectal  cancer.  Ninety  percent  of  these  cancers occur  in  people  over  the  age  of  50.  Six percent  of  people  age  75  to  80  have  had colorectal  cancer  at  some  point  in their life; one out of 16. The  good  news  is  that  the  odds  of beating  colorectal  cancer go up  significantly  with  early  detection.  With  that in  mind,  the  American  Cancer  Society recently  updated  its  screening  guidelines to increase early detection. In addition, Medicare has expanded coverage of screening tests. It  is  hoped  these  changes,  along with new  screening  methods  being  tested, Madam  Speaktime  as  I  may the  bal",

Mr.  Speaker,  the  strengthening  Abuse  and  neglect Courts  Act  of  2000  will  build  on  the  success of  the  Adoption  and  Safe  Families  Act  of  1997 (ASFA)  which  required  states  to  shorten  the length  of  time  that  children  remain  in  foster care  by  filing  termination  of  parental  rights  petitions at 15 months. Implementation  of  ASFA  has  resulted  in  an unprecedented  64  percent  increase  in  adoptions out of  foster  care  since 1996. As  a  direct  result  of  ASFA,  developed  by the  Committee  on  Ways  and  means,  new pressures  have  been  put  on  state  courts  to hold  permanency  hearings,  implement  permanency  plans,  make  judicial  findings  and  finalize  adoptions  cases  involving  abused  and  neglected  children  in a  timely  fashion. The  Strengthening  Abuse  and  Neglect Courts  Act  of  2000  will  increase  the  efficiency and  capacity  of  the  nation\u2019s  abuse  and  neglect courts  by  providing  funds  to  state  courts  to computerize  a  data  collection  and  case  tracking  system.  This  system  will  allow  judges  to track  the  number  of  children  under  judicial care  to  monitor  how  these  children  are  faring. A  case  tracking  system  will  allow  judges  to keep  a  running  account  of  the  number  and type  of  services  offered  to  the  family  and  the results  of  these  interventions.  This  information is  critical  to  keeping  children  safe  and  promoting permanency. This  Act  will  enable  state  and  local  courts  to reduce  existing  backlogs  of  children  awaiting termination  of  parental  rights  or  finalization  of adoption.  According  to  the  Department  of Health  and  Human  Services  there  were  over 103,000  children  awaiting  adoption  in  1998. Grants  provided  to  state  courts  under  this  Act will  allow  courts  to  hire  additional  judges  to hear  these  cases  and  to  establish  night  court sessions  for hearing  these  cases. The  Strengthening  Abuse  and  Neglect Courts Act  of  2000  is  a  logical  next  step  to  the Adoption  and  Safe  Families  Act  of  1997.  We need  courts  that  work  to  reduce  delays  and keep  children  safe  and  in  loving  families.  This legislation  does  that  and  I wholeheartedly  support  it. Mr.  SCOTT.

Mr.  CANNON.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself  such  time  as  I  may  consume  to thank  the  gentleman  from  Michigan (Mr.  for  his  limited  support of this bill. It is an important bill. I  would  just  point  out  that  the  Senate  version  has  been  around  for  a  very long  time.  There  are  at  least  two  copies;  the  Speaker  has  a  copy  and  my staff  has  a  copy  here.  So  the  issue  has been around for a while and it is a very important  issue  that  we  need  to  move forward  with  under  the  current  circumstances. Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  such  time  as  he may  consume  to  the  gentleman  from Texas  (Mr. SMITH), the chairman of the Subcommittee  on  Immigration  and Claims. Mr.  SMITH  of  Texas.  Mr.  Speaker,  I want  to  recognize  two Members  on  the House  floor  tonight.  The  gentleman from  California  (Mr.  who  is chairman  of  the  House  Committee  on Rules,  has  been  a  tireless  advocate  on behalf  of  the  high-tech  industry.  I  do not  know  of  anyone  who  has  worked harder, invested more time and energy, or  is  more  responsible  for  the  bill  that we are considering tonight being on the House  floor,  and  I  would  like  to  congratulate  him  in  advance  on  the  expected passage of this bill. Second  of  all,  the  gentleman  from Utah  (Mr.  who  just  yielded me  the  time,  is  an  active  member  of the Subcommittee  on  Immigration  and Claims, and he too has been a steadfast advocate of the high-tech industry. The gentleman  from  Utah  himself  is  an  entrepreneur  and  he  understands  firsthand  the  needs  of  the  high-tech  industry. Mr.  Speaker,  although  there  is  still no  objective  credible  study  that  documents  the  shortage  of  American  hightech  workers,  the  INS  said  recently that  the  demand  for  highly  skilled  foreign  workers  is  running  at  least  50,000 ahead  of  last  year.  Such  a  demand  can indicate  an  actual  shortage  of  American  workers,  a  spot  shortage,  a  preference  for  cheap  labor  or  replacement workers,  or  something  else.  But  because  of  the  importance  of  the  hightech  industry  to  our  economy,  I  think we should give the  industry the benefit of the doubt. But  giving  high-tech  companies  the benefit  of  the  doubt  is  not  without risk,  unless  we  safeguard  American workers.  We  need  to  recognize  the  opposition  of  the  American  people  to  an H\u20131B  visa  increase,  Mr.  Speaker.  Two major  polls  demonstrate  that  the  vast majority  of  Americans  do  not  want  to see  the  number  of  high-tech  visas  increased  so much  and worry  that  it will hurt American workers. A Peter Hart poll conducted in March found  that  73  percent  of  Americans  do not  want  to  see  immigration  law changed to allow the entry of more foreign high-tech workers. Only 20 percent wanted more foreign workers. A  Harris  poll,  released  in  September 1998,  found  that  82  percent  of  Americans do not want to see the H\u20131B quota increased.  The  poll  found  that  77  percent  of  Americans  believe  that  an  increase  in  H\u20131B  visas  reduces  employment opportunities for American workers.  And  86  percent  of  Americans  believe  that  U.S.  companies  should  train U.S.  workers  to  perform  jobs  in  technical  fields,  even  if  it  is  faster  and  less expensive  to  fill  the  jobs  with  foreign workers. To  satisfy  the  concerns  of  the  American  people,  we  need  to  protect  American  workers  from  being  undercut  by foreign  workers  in  the  H\u20131B  program. S.2045  contains  no  significant  provisions  to  protect  these  American  workers. It does not require most companies to  make  a  good-faith  effort  to  recruit U.S.  workers  before  hiring  foreign workers. It allows all but a small handful  of  firms  to  lay  off  American  workers  and  replace  the  American  workers with foreign workers. Why would anyone oppose these common sense safeguards? What amazes me is that in all the discussions I have had with  representatives  of  high-tech  companies,  not  a  single  one  has  expressed any  concern  about  the  impact  of  this legislation  on  American  workers.  How could  anyone  oppose  a  safeguard  that says  American  workers  could  not  be fired and  replaced by a  foreign worker? How  could  anyone  not  agree  to  advertise for American workers before hiring from abroad? How  could anyone oppose paying  foreign  workers  what  the  average  beginning  salary  is  for  American college  graduates,  unless  they  want  to undercut American wages? The  Committee  on  the  Judiciary passed  a  bill,  H.R.  4227,  that  contains an  additional  crucial  safeguard  for American  workers.  The  Committee  on the  Judiciary  passed  a  bill  that  set  a floor  on  wages  for  these  workers; $40,000  per  year.  This  wage  is  a  good starting point for any high-tech professional.  It  is  a  salary  that  American students  fresh  out  of  college  are  making.  This  crucial  safeguard  would  prevent  U.S.  companies  from  hiring  foreign  workers  to  undercut  the  wages  of American workers. Strong  anti-fraud  measures  are  also necessary  to  address  known  abuses. An article  in  last  Thursday\u2019s  \u2018\u2018San  Francisco  Chronicle\u2019\u2019  says  it  all:  \u2018\u2018Federal authorities have started nationwide  investigations  into  the  hiring  of  foreign high-tech workers, including charges of visa  fraud  and  allegations  that  the practice  is  riddled  with  abuse.\u2019\u2019  The Chronicle  quotes  Bill  Yates  of  the  INS as  stating,  \u2018\u2018But  are  we  catching  most of  the  fraud?  The  truthful  answer  is that we are not. If it is the intention of the  employee  or  the  employer  to  defraud  the  government,  you  may  not  be able to ferret it out.\u2019\u2019 A just-released Government Accounting  Office  report  states,  \u2018\u2018There  is  not sufficient  assurance  that  INS  reviews are  adequate  for  detecting  program noncompliance  or  abuse.  The  program is vulnerable to abuse, both by employers  who  do  not  have  bona  fide  jobs  to b not conwho fill  or  do  not  meet  required  labor  ditions,  and  by  potential  workers  present false credentials. 1845 \u2018\u2018The goals of preventing abuse of the program  and  providing  efficient  services  to  employers  and  workers  are  not being  achieved.  Evidence  suggests  that program  noncompliance  or  abuse  by employers may be more prevalent  than under other laws.\u2019\u2019 Mr.  Speaker,  any  H\u20131B  bill  should contain effective antifraud measures as are  contained  in  the Committee  on  the Judiciary-passed  H.R.  4227.  S.  2045  contains no such antifraud measures. Mr.  Speaker,  in  return  for  giving high-tech  companies  hundreds  of  thousands  of  more  foreign  workers,  all  we ask  on  behalf  of  American  workers  is some  minimal,  basic,  common  sense safeguards to ensure that businesses do not want  to hire  cheap  foreign workers at  the  expense  of  American  workers. While  this  bill  has  taken  significant steps  to  alleviate  the  presumed  shortage  with  more  training  for  American workers,  such  provisions  will  not  yield benefits for many years. Supplying  future  workers  is  a  different  issue  altogether  from  shielding today\u2019s  American  workers  from  the consequences  of  admitting  so  many workers from other countries. Mr.  Speaker,  Congress  should  turn its back on American workers. Again  I  appreciate  and  recognize  the work done by the gentleman from California  (Mr.  and  by  the  gentleman  from  Utah  (Mr.  and congratulate them. Mr.  CONYERS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield such  time  as  she  may  consume  to  the gentlewoman  from  California  (Ms. who  worked  harder  on  this measure  than any other member of  the Committee on the Judiciary.

It  was  about  a  year  ago  that  I  began drafting  some  of  the  measures  that  ultimately  found  their  way  into  the  bill passed  by  the  Senate  last  night.  But  I was not  the only one on our  side of  the aisle  who  worked  on  this  bill.

Yet,  it  ensures  that  the GAO  has  adequate  time  and  resources to fulfill its new responsibilities, and it preserves  GAO\u2019s  traditional  role  as auditor. Mr.  Speaker,  my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I  yield  such  time  as  she  may  consume to  the  gentlewoman  from  New  York (Mrs.  KELLY),  the  champion  of  small business,  the  chairman  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Regulatory  Reform  and Paperwork  Reduction,  and  the  champion of CORA. Mrs. KELLY. Mr. Speaker,  the Truth in  Regulating  Act  represents  the  culmination  of  nearly  4  years  of  hard work  and  an  effort  that  will  provide Congress  with  a  new  resource  for  reviewing  new  government  regulations before they take effect. I first introduced this legislation during  the  105th  Congress,  Mr.  Speaker, with  the  goal  of  giving  Congress  the tools  it  needs  to  oversee  the  steady stream  of  new  and  often  costly  regulations  coming  from  the  Federal  government. Government  regulations  have  an  impact  on  every  American. We  see  an  average  of  close  to  4,000  new  regulations promulgated every year. In most  cases,  regulations  speak  to  a noble  purpose,  and  can  often  be  viewed as a measure of the value that we place in  protecting  such  things  as  human health,  workplace  safety,  or  the  environment.  Yet,  too  often  the  government  oversteps  its  bounds  in  its  attempt  to  achieve  these  goals,  and  we all pay the price as a consequence. The  price  of  regulations  poses  a  particularly  heavy  burden  on  small  businesses  and  manufacturers.  They  drive our  economy  forward.  They  need  our help. Estimates  vary  on  the  annual  cost  of government  regulations  from  a  range of  $300  billion  a  year  to  $700  billion every year. Congress has a special entity,  the  Congressional  Budget  Office,  or CBO,  to  help  it  grapple  with  our  enormous  Federal  budget.  There  is  growing sentiment that a similar office  is needed  within  the  legislative  branch  to  review and analyze the numerous government  regulations  that  are  developed and issued every year. To  address  this  need,  in  1997  I  first introduced  legislation  to  create  the Congressional  Office  of  Regulatory Analysis,  or  CORA.  Today\u2019s  legislation is the culmination of that effort. As  the  vice  chairman  of  the  Committee  on  Small  Business  and  the Chairwoman  of  the  Subcommittee  on Regulatory  Reform  and  Paperwork  Reduction, and as a  small businesswoman myself,  I  know  that  small  business owners  are  very  familiar  with  the  burdens  that  Federal  regulations  place  on them. Some  studies  have  shown  that  for small employers, the cost of complying with  Federal  regulations  is  more  than double  what  it  cost  their  larger  counterparts.  Mr.  Speaker,  we  do  not  need any  study  to  reach  that  conclusion. Common sense says that if a regulation costs  a  company  with  a  $5  billion  revenue stream the same as it does a company with  a  $5 million  revenue  stream, the overall  impact on  the  smaller company  will  be  significantly  more  on  a per unit basis. S.  1198  creates  an  office  within  GAO that  would  focus  solely  on  conducting independent  regulatory  evaluations  of regulations  to  help  determine  whether the  agencies  have  complied  with  the law  and  executive  orders.  The  fact  is, Congress  cannot  obtain  unbiased  information  from  the  participants  in  the rulemaking  because  each  participant, including  the  Federal  agency,  has  a particular viewpoint and bias. This  legislation will  fill  the  information  gap  and  assist  Members  in  Congress  in  determining  whether  action  is warranted. The purpose of the bill  is to ensure  Congress  exercises  its  legislative  powers  in  the most  informed manner  possible.  Ultimately,  this  will  lead to better and more finely tuned legislation,  as  well  as  more  effective  agency regulations. The  office will  provide  Congress with reliable, non-partisan  information,  levelling  the  playing  field with  the  executive  branch  and  improving  Congress\u2019 ability  to  understand  the  burdens  that are  placed  on  small  businesses  and  the economy by excessive regulation.

The  Chair  recognizes  the  from Utah (Mr. HANSEN). Mr.  HANSEN.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5331  is a bipartisan bill  that  was  introduced  by  the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DAVIS). Mr. Speaker, Frederick Douglass was one  of  the  most  prominent  leaders  of the  19th  century  abolitionist  movement.  Born  into  slavery  in  eastern Maryland  in  1818,  Douglass  escaped  to the North as a young man where he became  a  world-renowned  defender  of human  rights  and  eloquent  orator,  and later a Federal ambassador and advisor to  several  Presidents.  Frederick  Douglass  was  a  powerful  voice  for  human rights  during  the  important  period  of American  history,  and  is  still  revered today  for  his  contributions  against  racial injustice. H.R.  5331  authorizes  the  Frederick Douglass  Gardens,  Inc.,  a  nonprofit  organization,  in partnership with the National  Park  Service,  to  establish  a memorial  and  gardens  in  the  District  of Columbia  or  its  environs  in  honor  and commemoration of Frederick Douglass. Although  not  certain,  the  preferred site  would  be  in  the  D.C.  area,  east  of the  Anacostia  River,  where  Douglass spent the last 20 years of his life. The  Douglass  memorial  will  comply with  the  Commemorative  Works  Act, and  no  Federal  funds  may  be  spent  for any expense of the establishment of the memorial  and  gardens.  Mr.  Speaker,  I urge  my  colleagues  to  support  H.R. 5331. Mr.  Speaker,  my time. Mr.  FALEOMAVAEGA.  Mr.  Speaker, I  yield myself  such  time  as  I may  consume. (Mr.  FALEOMAVAEGA  asked  and was  given  permission  to  revise  and  extend his remarks.) Mr.  FALEOMAVAEGA.  Mr.  Speaker, I  want  to  commend  the  gentleman from  Illinois  (Mr.  DAVIS),  who  is  the chief  sponsor  of  this  legislation.  I  am also  listed  as  an  original  cosponsor  of this bill. Mr. Speaker, H.R.  5331 authorizes  the establishment  of  a  memorial  and  gardens  in  the  District  of  Columbia  or  its environs  to  honor  and  commemorate the  life  and  achievements  of  Frederick Douglass.  Frederick  Douglass  was  the Nation\u2019s  leading  19th  century  African American  spokesman.  A  gifted  writer and speaker, he was a key  figure  in the abolitionist movement. Because  of  this historic  significance,  the  National Park  Service  administers  the  Frederick  Douglass  national  historic  site currently now in Washington, D.C. Mr.  Speaker,  we  are  supportive  of this  measure,  and  I  want  to  commend again  my  good  friend,  the  gentleman from  Illinois,  for  his  leadership  in sponsoring this legislation. Mr.  Speaker,  I  reserve  the  my time. Mr.  HANSEN.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield such  time  as  he  may  consume  to  the gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  SHIMKUS). balance  balance  of of I  reserve  the  HANSEN)  Mr.  SHIMKUS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  want to  personally  thank  the  gentleman from  Utah  (Mr.  and  the  ranking  member  for  moving  this  expeditiously,  and  I  want  to  join  my  colleagues  in  urging  the  passage  of  H.R. 5331,  which  establishes  the  Frederick Douglass  National  Memorial  Gardens within the District of Columbia. For  years  now,  many  people  have asked  about  the  legacy  of  Frederick Douglass. Certainly  it  lives  on  through his  family,  especially  his  great  great grandson,  Frederick  Douglass,  IV,  who I  had  the  pleasure  of  meeting  last week,  and  it  also  lives  on  within  each of  us  because  Frederick  Douglass  bestowed  upon  us  an  awesome  responsibility  to  choose  the  harder  right  over the easier wrong. He freed himself from slavery  and  went  on  to  advise  President  Lincoln,  and  served  as  an  inspiration  to  those  who  yearned  to  breathe free. Earlier today, the House passed legislation  to  appropriate  funds  for  the Abraham  Lincoln  Presidential  Library to  be  built  in  Springfield,  Illinois.  I think  that  President  Lincoln  would  be pleased  that  we  would  honor  another hero  of  the  common  man  by  passing this  bill  to  establish  the  Frederick Douglass  National  Memorial  and  Gardens. Like  President  Lincoln,  Frederick Douglass  stands  as  a  reminder  of  a time  when  our  Nation  faced  its  greatest peril. Through the strength of their resolve  and  the  millions  of  others  who had  tasted  freedom,  our  Nation  survived  and  flourished.  There  are  still many  issues  and  problems  facing  us today,  but  the  foundation  they  built for  us  stands  strong  and  allows  us  the opportunity  to meet  our  challenges  together. Frederick Douglass paved the way for us  to better understand  the  true meaning  of  the  statement  that  all  men  are created  equal.  His  legacy  lives  in  each of  us,  and  with  the  memorial  gardens we  will  ensure  that  his  legacy  lives among us as well. Mr. Speaker,  I applaud my colleague, the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. DAVIS),  for  his  forethought  in  bringing this  legislation to the  floor, and I want to  thank  him  for  bringing  me  into  the fold  and  allowing  me  to  help  him  cosponsor  this  legislation.  I  also  want  to thank him for his leadership. Mr.  FALEOMAVAEGA.  Mr.  Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. DAVIS). Mr.  DAVIS  of  Illinois.  Mr.  Speaker, first of all, let me thank the gentleman from  American  Samoa  for  yielding  me this  time.  I  also  want  to  thank  the ranking  member  of  the  subcommittee not  only  for  his  diligence  but  also  for his  sensitivity  in  helping  to  move  this legislation forward. Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  pleased  to  be  a principal  sponsor  of  this  legislation  to honor the renowned 19th century abolitionist  leader  Frederick  Douglass  with the  National  Memorial  and  Gardens  in the Nation\u2019s  capitol. Without question, Frederick  Douglass  is  an  American hero deserving of such honor. During  the  course  of  his  remarkable life,  Frederick  Douglass  freed  himself from  slavery  and  became  internationally  renowned  for  his  eloquence  in  the cause  of  individual  liberty  and  human rights.  Douglass  is  rightfully  regarded as  the  true  father  of  the  civil  rights  in America  and  one  of  profound  intellectual thought. Frederick  Douglass  published  the North  Star  and  Frederick  Douglass\u2019 Paper,  which  spread  news  of  the  abolitionist  movement.  His  piercing  commentary earned him a role as a trusted advisor  to  President  Abraham  Lincoln and  other  American  Presidents  as  the Nation  struggled  to  make  good  on  the promise of emancipation. Breaking  yet  another  racial  barrier, in  1877,  Frederick  Douglass moved  to  a house on a hill, Cedar Hill, he called it, in  the  Anacostia  neighborhood  of Washington,  D.C.,  where  he  could  look down  on  the  Nation\u2019s  most  historic monuments  from  the  sanctity  of  his garden. From  his  offices  in  Anacostia  in  the late 19th century, he published the New National  Era,  a  beacon  for  a  reformed, racially  integrated  Nation  which  was to  be  published,  in  his  words,  \u2018\u2018in  the interest  of  the  colored  people  of  America;  not  as  a  separate  class,  but  as  a part  of  the  whole  people,\u2019\u2019  the  American people. He represented the United States as a foreign  diplomat  in  both  Haiti  and  the Dominican  Republic  and  also  served  as a  member  of  the  Howard  University Board  of  Directors.  He  resided  in  Anacostia until his death  in 1895, and  is remembered  by  local  schoolchildren  to this date as the \u2018\u2018Sage of Anacostia.\u2019\u2019 In  a  speech  for  which  he  is  perhaps most  well-known,  Frederick  Douglass deplored  how  little  democratic  ideals had  yet  extended  to  his  people.  By building  a  national  memorial  and  gardens  to  Douglass  in  the  Nation\u2019s  capitol,  in  the  sight  line  of  the  U.S.  Capitol, we demonstrate that his voice was heard. America  is not  finished  fighting  for a 4th of July  that  includes all people. By surrounding the memorial with a beautiful garden, we pay tribute to the contemplative  side of  the man  that  fed his public  passion.  We  remember  a  man who  understood  rightly  the  nature  of true power. He knew the value of power vested  in  a  \u2018\u2018moral  majority  of  one.\u2019\u2019 To  quote  his  contemporary,  Thoreau, \u2018\u2018And  he  wielded  the  power  of  personal example  as  his weapon  of  choice  in  the greatest  moral  struggle  of  modern times.\u2019\u2019 The  outcome  of  that  struggle  could be different if not for the looming presence  of  Douglass,  a man  who  Langston Hughes  said  quite  simply,  \u2018\u2018is  not dead,\u2019\u2019  and  we  know  what  he meant.  It would  be  inappropriate  to  build  a  passive  memorial  of  silent,  motionless stone.  Our  most  fitting  tribute  to Douglass  is  a  memorial  that  will  include  in  its  presentation  the  living, ",

Mr.  Speaker,  I move  to  suspend  the  rules and agree  to the  concurrent  resolution  (H.Con.Res. 390)  expressing  the  sense  of  the  Congress  regarding  Taiwan\u2019s  participation in the United Nations, as amended. The Clerk read as follows: H. CON. RES. 390 Whereas  Taiwan  has  dramatically  improved  its  record  on  human  rights  and  routinely  holds  free  and  fair  elections  in  a multiparty  system,  as  evidenced  most  recently  by  Taiwan\u2019s  second  democratic  presidential  election  of  March  18,  2000,  in  which Mr. Chen Shui-bian was elected as president; Whereas  the  23,000,000  people  on  Taiwan are  not  represented  in  the  United  Nations and many  other  international  organizations, and  their  human  rights  as  citizens  of  the world are therefore severely abridged; Whereas  Taiwan  has  in  recent  years  repeatedly  expressed  its  strong  desire  to  participate  in  the  United  Nations  and  other international organizations; Whereas Taiwan has much to contribute to the  work  and  funding  of  the  United  Nations and other international organizations; Whereas  the  world  community  has  reacted positively  to  Taiwan\u2019s  desire  for  international participation, as shown by Taiwan\u2019s membership  in  the Asian Development Bank and  Taiwan\u2019s  admission  to  the  Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation  group  as  a  full  member  and  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  as an observer; Whereas  the  United  States  has  supported Taiwan\u2019s  participation  in  these  bodies  and, in  the  Taiwan  Policy  Review  of  September 1994,  declared  an  intention  of  a  stronger  and more  active  policy  of  support  for  Taiwan\u2019s in  appropriate  international participation  organizations; Whereas  Public  Law  106\u2013137  required  the Secretary  of  State  to  submit  a  report  to  the Congress  on  administration  efforts  to  support  Taiwan\u2019s  participation  in  international organizations,  in  particular  the  World Health Organization; and Whereas  in  such  report  the  Secretary  of State  failed  to  endorse  Taiwan\u2019s  participation  in  international  organizations  and thereby  did  not  follow  the  spirit  of  the  1994 Taiwan  Policy  Review:  Now,  therefore,  be  it Resolved by  the House of Representatives  (the Senate concurring), That  it  is the sense of the Congress that\u2014 (1)  Taiwan  and  its  23,000,000  people  deserve appropriate  meaningful  participation  in  the United Nations and other international organizations such as the World Health Organization; and (2)  the  United  States  should  fulfill  the commitment it made in the 1994 Taiwan Policy  Review  to  more  actively  support  Taiwan\u2019s  participation  in  appropriate  international organizations. pro  the  ROHRABACHER)  The  SPEAKER  tempore.  Pursuant  to  the  rule,  gentleman  from California  (Mr.  and  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BROWN) each will control 20 minutes. The  Chair  recognizes  the  gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER). Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I yield  myself  such  time  as  I  may  consume. Mr.  Speaker,  the  people  of  Taiwan have  proved  that  freedom  and  democracy  are  not  just  American  ideals,  not just  European  ideals,  they  are  the  universal  principles  that  apply  to  every individual,  to  every  community  and every  nation  as  our  Founding  Fathers stated,  that  we  look  at  the  rights  as being  God  given  to  all  people  on  this planet. The  United  States  State  Department\u2019s report on the Taiwan Policy Review  1994  clearly  stated  that  the  U.S. should  more  actively  support  Taiwan\u2019s membership  in  international  organizations,  because  Taiwan  has  lived  up  to the  ideals  that  we  expect  of  democracies. And President Clinton, however, has  not  used  our  influence  in  international  bodies  to  try  to  insist  that Taiwan  be  able  to  participate  in  these organizations.  Congressional  support for Taiwan is solid. Taiwan  has  made  enormous  strides towards  becoming  a  full  democracy,  as I  stated,  and  it  is  unreasonable  for  the people  of  Taiwan  to  be  excluded  from the  full  participation  in  international organizations  due  to  threats  from mainland  China.  Unfortunately,  what we  have  today  is  a  Communist  dictatorship  headed  by  gangsters  who  have never  been  elected  to  anything,  who are  making  demands  upon  us  to  mistreat  a  democratically  elected  government in Taiwan. It  is  embarrassing  that  our  administration  seems  to  be  kowtowing  to  that type of pressure. The United States has supported  Taiwan\u2019s  membership  in  the Asian  Development  Bank  and  its  admission  to  the  Asian-Pacific  Economic Cooperation  group.  Extending  United Nations and World Health Organization membership  is  the  next  step  in  demof balance  onstrating U.S. support  for Taiwan and a  United  States  commitment  to  those people  around  the world who  believe  in democracy and freedom and liberty and justice  and  have  actually  moved  to make  sure  their  country,  as  Taiwan has done, enshrines those ideals. China\u2019s continued harassment and intimidation  of  Taiwan  also  underlines the  urgency  and  necessity  of  Taiwan\u2019s participation  in  the  United  Nations. Taiwan  currently  does  not  have  access to  the  United  Nations  Security  Council,  and  the  forum  countries  whose safety  is  in  jeopardy  and  they  must turn  to.  Not  only  that,  but  after  Taiwan  has  joined  the  United  Nations\u2019  responsibility  for  Taiwan  safety  and  security,  it  will  be  shifted  solely  to  the United  States  as  laid  down  in  the  1979 Taiwan\u2019s  Relations  Act  to  the  international community. Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  ask  my  colleagues  to  support  this  legislation,  and in  doing  so,  strike  a  very  solid  note that  can  be  heard  around  the  world  in the halls of the dictatorships in Beijing but  also  in  the  halls  of  democracy  in Taiwan and  in  those  countries  that are struggling  to  be  free  that  shows  the United  States  is  on  the  side  of  democracy and democratic people. Mr.  Speaker,  I  reserve  the  my time. Mr.  BROWN  of  Ohio.  Mr.  Speaker,  I yield  myself  such  time  as  I  may  consume. Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  in  support  of  the resolution.  Taiwan\u2019s  40-year  journey toward  democracy  is  one  of  the  20th century\u2019s  great  success  stories.  The people  of  Taiwan  have  proved  to  the whole  world  that  freedom  and  democracy are not just American ideals; they are  universal  principles  that  apply  to every  individual,  to  every  community and to every Nation. We  must  take  steps  to  reward  nations  like  Taiwan  that  are  making such  great  progress  towards  democracy. Mr.  Speaker,  I  dream  of  a  day  when Taiwan  is  a  contributing  member  of the  World  Trade  Organization,  the World  Health  Organization  and  the United  Nations.  I  dream  of  a  day  when the U.S. will  replace  its  one  China  policy with a policy of one China, one Taiwan, one Tibet. H.Con.Res.  390  recognizes  that  Taiwan and its 23 million people deserve to participate  in  the  UN  and  other  international  organizations,  such  as  the World Health Organization. The  U.S.  should  fulfill  its  commitment  made  in  the  1994  Taiwan  Policy Review  to  more  actively  support  Taiwan\u2019s  membership  in  organizations such  as  the UN  and  the WHO. This  legislation  has  received  broad  bipartisan support,  86  colleagues  from  both  sides of  the  aisle  have  cosponsored  this  bill. Taiwan\u2019s growing regional and global significance  demands  a  more  active and  thoughtful  U.S.  policy.  Our  ties with  Taiwan  must  encompass  all  aspects  of  Taiwan\u2019s  security,  trade  relations  and  support  for  the  right  of  self",

The  PRESIDENT  pro  tempore.  Senator is correct. Mr.  REID. Mr.  President,  H\u20131B  originated  in  our  immigration  laws  in  the 1950\u2019s  so  that  trained  professionals could  work  for  a  limited  time  in  the U.S.  In  1990,  a  cap  was  set  on  the  category for the first time of 65,000. Employers  in  every  industry and  sector of our economy, including manufacturing,  higher  education,  health  care, research,  finance and others, have used it. Employers  from major multinational companies  to  small  businesses  seeking individuals  with  specific  skills  needed to grow their companies have used it. It  became  wildly  popular  in  the  mid to late 90s following the Internet boom, when hundreds  of hungry  tech  startups across the country began using it to recruit  high  tech  workers  from  information  technology  jobs,  mostly  from India,  China,  Canada,  and  Britain. Some 420,000 are here today. Those  individuals  have  filled  a  critical  shortage  of  high-tech  workers  in this  country,  which  in  fact,  still  exists today. The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first  Century  Act  of  2000  proposes  to  raise  the  caps  for  the  number of  H\u20131B  workers  that  employers  can bring  into  the  United  States  for  the next 3 years. N O T  I C E Effective  January  1,  2001,  the  subscription  price  of  the  Congressional  Record  will  be  $393  per  year  or  $197  for  six months.

Illinois. I am happy to report that with the  nomination  and  confirmation  of Michael  Reagan,  we  will  have  a  full complement  of  Federal  judges  in  our State,  which  will  make  the  workload more  manageable  all  across  the  State. So  I  thank  Senator  and  also Senator  We  have  been working  for  the  last  2  years,  on  a  very bipartisan  basis,  toward  approving these  nominees  to  have  come  before the Senate. Before  I  address  the  nomination  of Michael  Reagan,  I  would  like  to  address  a  larger  issue  which  involves  not only  the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee but  the  entire  Senate,  the  Congress, and  the  people  of  this  country  because this week marks the opening of the Supreme  Court\u2019s  new  term.  It  is  a  good moment  to  reflect  on  the  role  of  the Supreme Court, its past, and its future. This brief statement that I present to you  represents  some  of  the  concerns  I have about the Supreme Court, the role it  is  playing,  and  the  impact  of  the Presidential  election  on  the  future  of that Court. One  of  the  most  interesting  books ever  written  about  America  was  written by a French  tourist by  the name of Alexis  de  Tocqueville.  He  came  to  the United  States  165  years  ago,  traveling around  different  cities  and  making  observations  about  this  American  character. This was a brand new nation. De Tocqueville  wrote  in  his  famous  work his observations and took them back to Europe. One might  think  that  a  book  such  as that  would  be  lost  in  history.  It  turns out  that  de  Tocqueville\u2019s  observations were  so  impressive  that  165  years  later we  still  turn  to  this  book,  and  I  think it  is  nothing  short  of  amazing  that  his observations  turn  out  to  be  valid today.  De  Tocqueville  made  an  observation  about  America  and  about  all  of the  important  political  questions  in our  country which  sooner  or  later  turn out  to  be  judicial  questions.  This wasn\u2019t  a  criticism.  Quite  the  contrary. De  Tocqueville  admired  the  innovations  in  the  American  judiciary  that granted  the  courts  the  independence and clarity of  function that were  found nowhere  else  in  the  world.  De Tocqueville believed these observations would  mean  that  America\u2019s  judicial system  would  hear,  and  act  on,  the most  important  issues  of  the  day.  He couldn\u2019t have been more correct. Think  about  the  \u2018\u2018big  issues\u2019\u2019.  The issues  that  the  American  people  have cared about\u2014argued about\u2014most deeply.  The  issues  that  spark  the  most  debate\u2014and  the  most  passion.  Sooner  or later,  the  battle  over  these  issues comes  before  the  highest  court  in  the land. Slavery. Child labor. Worker safety.  Monopolies.  Unionization.  Freedom of  the  press.  Capital  punishment.  Segregation.  Environmental  protection. Voting  rights.  A  woman\u2019s  right  to choose. The  battle  always  comes  to  the  Supreme  Court;  always  comes  before  the nine  justices  who  are  Constitutionally and responsibilities,  granted  enormous  enormous power. In  just  the  past  year,  the  Supreme Court  has  offered  important  rulings  on abortion,  school prayer, gay  rights, aid to  parochial  schools,  pornography,  Miranda  rights,  violence  against  women, parental  rights\u2014just  to  name  a  few. Not  all  of  these  decisions  have  turned out as I would have hoped. For  instance,  take  the  case  of  U.S. vs.  Morrison.  The  Supreme  Court struck  down  a  provision  of  the  Violence  Against  Women  Act  that  gave victims  of  rape  and  domestic  violence the  right  to  sue  their  attackers  in  federal  court.  Congress  passed  this  law  to give  women  an  additional  means  of pursuing  justice when they are the victims  of  assault. We  passed  this  law  because the States themselves did not always  adequately  pursue  rapists  and  assailants.  And  the  States  acknowledged this! Thirty-six  States  had  entered  this suit  on  behalf  of  the  woman  who  had been  victimized.  They  wanted  victims of  violence  against  women  to  retain the  right  to  bring  their  attackers  to court.  But  the  Supreme  Court,  in  a narrow  vote,  decided  otherwise.  The vote . . . five to four. But  this  close  margin  is  not  unusual on  our  highest  court\u2014it  is  becoming commonplace.  Rarely  has  the  Supreme Court  been  so  narrowly  divided  for such a long period of time. The replacement  of  just  one  judge  could  drastically  change  the  dynamic  of  the Court for decades to come. Chief  Justice  Rehnquist  and  Justices Scalia  and  Thomas\u2014the  Court\u2019s  most conservative  members\u2014tend  to  vote together  on  hot  button  social  and  political issues such as affirmative action and  school  prayer.  Centrist  conservatives, Justices O\u2019Connor and Kennedy, usually  join  them.  The  dissent  is  often written  by  the  more  liberal  justices\u2014 Stevens,  Souter,  Ginsberg  and  Breyer. Both  Ginsberg  and  Breyer  are  Clinton appointments. Many  of  the  Supreme  Courts  decisions  have  been made  on  the  basis  of  a single  vote.  Partial  birth  abortion\u2014 five  to  four.  Age  discrimination\u2014five to  four.  Gay  rights\u2014five  to  four. Warantless  police  searches\u2014five  to four.  The  federal  role  in  death  penalty cases\u2014five to four. These  are  not  mere  academic  cases. These  are  decisions  that  change  people\u2019s  lives.  We  all  hope  that  the  Supreme  Court will  act wisely  and  fairly. But  we  also  all  know\u2014history  and human  nature  tell  us  so\u2014that  this  is not always the case. We  learned  in  school  about  the  Dred Scott  case.  Mr.  Scott  had  lived  in  my home  state  of  Illinois\u2014where  slavery was  banned\u2014and  sued  for  his  freedom on  the  basis  that  he  had  already  lived as a free man, and had the right to continue  to  do  so.  The  Supreme  Court  infamously  disagreed,  finding  that  Mr. Scott  was  nothing  more  than  property\u2014\u2018\u2018to  be  Used  in  Subserviency  to the  Interests,  the  Convenience,  or  the Will,  of  His  Owner\u2019\u2019,  a  man  \u2018\u2018Without Social,  Civil,  or  Political  Rights.\u2019\u2019  The decisions of the Supreme Court\u2014and at times, the opinion of just one Justice\u2014 can  make  the  difference  between  having, or losing, a cherished right. Perhaps  that  is  the  reason  that  my colleague,  the  senior  Senator  from Utah,  is  of  the  opinion  that  a  President\u2019s  power  to  make  nominations  to the  Supreme  Court  and  to  the  federal bench  is\u2014and  this  is  a  quote\u2014\u2018\u2018. . .the single  most  important  issue  of  this next election.\u2019\u2019 I think he\u2019s right. The next President may have the opportunity to make two or  three  appointments  to  the  Supreme Court.  He  may  even  appoint  the  next Chief Justice. In  the  first  two  hundred  years  since the signing of the Constitution, the Supreme  Court  invalidated  128  laws  that had  been  passed  by  Congress.  About one  law  every  two  years,  on  average. Since  1995,  however,  the  Court  has struck  down  21  laws,  more  than  four per  year.  This  is  an  unprecedented  assertion of judicial power. Will the next President try to use the appointment  process  to  further  shift the  balance  of  power  between  the branches of government? Will  the next President of  the United States  use  a  litmus  test  to  \u2018\u2018pack\u2019\u2019  the Supreme  Court with  Justices\u2014Justices whose  minds  were  already  made  up  on important issues? That  is  what  the  far  right,  members of  the  Federalist  Society,  want.  They want  to  turn  back  the  hands  of  the clock. So I\u2019m inclined to agree with the distinguished  Senator  from  Utah.  This  is, indeed,  one  of  the  most  important issues of the Presidential campaign. Imagine  a  Supreme  Court  with  three Antonin  Scalia\u2019s\u2014three  Clarence Thomases\u2014three  radically  conservative  Justices  bent  on  greatly  restricting the authority of the federal government.  The  philosophical  balance  of  the Court would shift dramatically. One by one  the  protections  that  have  been built  up  over  the  past  thirty  five  years could fall. If  you  read  the  history  of  the  Supreme  Court,  you  will  note  that  up until  the  time  Franklin  Roosevelt  was President, it was an extremely conservative  and  somewhat  lackluster  Court. The  Court  started  to  change  during Roosevelt\u2019s  Presidency,  and  beyond. Republican  and  Democratic  Presidents thereafter  appointed  more  activist judges who  looked  at  the  problems  facing  America.  One  by  one,  the  protections  which  we  built  up  over  that  period of time would be in jeopardy. Protection  of  the  rights  of  minorities, women,  and  the  handicapped;  protection  of  voting  rights,  civil  rights, worker rights, reproductive rights; protection  of  the  environment;  protection from  gun  violence;  and  protection  of our  fundamental  freedoms  as  Americans.  One  by  one,  a  different  court could  challenge  each  of  these  protections. ",
            "148": "October 3, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) S9667 On  top  of  that,  many  Iowa  Democrats  are still angry at how Campbell was treated during  her  race  for  governor.  The  prospect  that women such as Campbell will be shut out  for another  four  years  if  Bush  is  elected  president  is  like  a  booster  shot  for  get-out-thevote efforts. Harkin  said  Thursday  that  he  \u2018absolutely\u2019 would  push  Campbell  to  be  nominated  again if  Gore  wins  the  presidency.  For  the  time being, she serves Democrats\u2019 purposes just as well if she never dons black robes. [From the Cedar Rapids Gazette, Sept. 26, 2000] STOP STALLING ON JUDICIAL CANDIDATE In  three  weeks  or  less,  Congress  will  adjourn  before  the  2000  elections,  and  increasingly  it  appears  it  will  do  so  before  the  U.S. Senate  brings  the  nomination  of  Bonnie Campbell  to  the  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals  for the Eighth Circuit up for a vote. It\u2019s not as if Campbell, the former attorney general of Iowa, is trying to get in at the last minute\u2014unless  you  consider  a  six-month wait  the  last  minute.  Campbell  was  nominated  to  the  job  by  the  Clinton  Administration in March. She had a hearing in May. What\u2019s taking so long? It  seems  apparent  the  Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee  is growing  content  to  hold  onto  this  nomination until  after  the  session\u2014and,  not  coincidentally\u2014until  after  the  November  election, when  they  hope  to  win  the  White  House. That  would  mean  a  Republican  would  more than likely be appointed to the job. It is not unusual for political parties to try to  run  out  the  clock  on  nominations  in  the hope  the  next  election  will  bring  them  to power.  That  does  not  make  it  right,  and  in this  case  it  makes  no  sense  to  sit  on  the Campbell nomination. U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, is her sponsor  and  he  pointed  out  a  week  ago  there  are 22  vacancies  on  the  federal  appeals  court. Campbell  has  the  backing  of  the  American Bar  Association  and  the  Iowa  State  Police Association. She also has the backing of U.S. Sen.  Charles  Grassley,  R-Iowa,  who  is  also  a member  of  the  Judiciary  Committee.  Traditionally,  Grassley  and  Harkin  have  backed the other\u2019s nominees, and if Campbell\u2019s nomination  fails,  we  would  hate  to  see  that  understanding damaged. Frustrated  proponents  of  the  Campbell nomination\u2014as  well  as  several  other  nominations\u2014have  been  arguing  recently  that over  the  last  three  years, women  and minority candidates have had to wait longer to get through  the  confirmation  process  than  their white male counterparts. The chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, U.S.  Sen.  Orrin  Hatch,  R-Utah,  has  denied women  and  minorities  are  being  treated  differently  in  the  committee  than  their  white male counterparts. Still, of the 21 candidates for  the  federal  bench  who  are  women  or  minorities,  nine  have  been  waiting  for  more than a year for a hearing. Campbell  has  a  lengthy  record  in  private legal  practice.  Elected  in  1990,  she  was  the first  woman  to  serve  as  Iowa  Attorney  General.  She  was  appointed  in  1995  to  be  the  director of  the Violence Against Women Office in  the  U.S.  Justice  Department.  Her  hearing revealed  no  good  reason  why  she  should  be denied this position. The  Senate  leadership  should  do  the  right thing  in  the  waning  days  of  this  session  and let  the  full  Senate  vote  on  Campbell.  It should  set  aside  whatever  reason  it  has  for stalling  and  move  forward.  Let  the  process work  and  bring  this  nomination  to  the  floor for a vote. Mr.  HARKIN.  I  see  the  distinguished chairman  of  the  Judiciary  Committee ROBB HATCH RECORD and  ROBB HARKIN The from on  the  floor.  He  is  a  good man.  He  and I  have  fought  many  battles  together.  I like  him  personally  and  I  respect  him. If  he  would  like  to  engage  in  colloquy, I  will.  He  knows  how  strongly  I  feel about  this  nominee,  about  her  qualifications  and  about  the  kind  of  job  she has done at  the Department of Justice. I am sure he knows I will do everything that  is  humanly  and  senatorially  possible  to  try  to  get  her  name  here.  I  believe  I  have  a  right  and  an  obligation to do that. I will, within the confines of what  is  right and proper  in  the Senate, not violating any rules, do everything I can to try to get her name out. We will be here this week and we will be  here  next  week.  I  ask  my  friend from  Utah,  will  we  be  allowed  to  have a  vote  on  Bonnie  Campbell  for  the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals? I yield the floor. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Chair  recognizes  the  Senator  Utah. Mr.  HATCH.  Mr.  President,  I  will submit a resolution, and after these remarks  I  will  spend  some  time  answering  my  two  dear  colleagues,  Senator of  Virginia  and  Senator  from Iowa, to the best of my ability. (The  remarks  of  Mr.  pertaining to the submission of S. Res. 364 are  printed  in  today\u2019s  under \u2018\u2018Submission  of  Concurrent  Senate Resolutions.\u2019\u2019) Mr.  HATCH.  Mr.  President,  I  must respond  to  the  remarks  of  Senator and Senator HARKIN. With  regard  to  the  nomination  of Roger  L.  Gregory,  the  position  for which Mr. Gregory has been nominated has been vacant  since  it was created  in 1990.  Before  nominating  Mr.  Gregory, the President had not even submitted a name  to  the Senate  for  this position  in almost  5  years.  Despite  the  longstanding vacancy of  this  judgeship,  the work  of  the  Fourth  Circuit  has  not been adversely affected. Moreover,  when  the  President  did submit  a  name  to  the  Senate  for  disposition  almost  5  years  ago,  he  submitted  the name  of  a  resident  of North Carolina,  J.  Rich  Leonard.  In  doing  so, the  President  effectively  agreed  that this  seat  should  be  filled  by  a  North Carolinian. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Without objection,  the  Senator\u2019s  previous  time consumed  on  the  Olympics  will  not count against his 7 minutes. Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent I  be  able  to  speak  for  another  15  minutes. The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  objection, it is so ordered. Mr.  HATCH.  The  President  effectively  agreed  this  seat  should  be  filled by  a  North  Carolinian.  By  nominating Roger  Gregory,  a  Virginian,  for  the seat  instead  of  a  North  Carolinian,  the President  sought  to  avoid  the  traditional  practice  of  seeking  the  \u2018\u2018advice and  consent\u2019\u2019  of  the  Senators  from  the State  where  the  judgeship  is  located about  which  local  lawyer  should  be nominated. Without KYL It  is  very  late  in  the  session  to  be considering a circuit court nomination. Some  nominations  can  move  through the  confirmation  process  quickly,  but only  where  the  White  House  has  dealt with  the  Senate  on  nominations  in good  faith.  The  Arizona  nominations we  are  debating  today  moved  through the  confirmation  process  quickly  because the White House did work closely with  Senator  and  negotiated  in good faith over which Arizonans should get these lifetime appointments. In  contrast,  the White House  has  not dealt  with  the  Senate  on  nominations in  good  faith.  During  our  August  recess,  the  President  determined  to  recess  appoint  several  executive  branch officials  over  the  express  objections  of numerous  Senators.  Furthermore, Democrats  stood  in  the  way  of  these four  nominees  we  are  debating  today, the  President\u2019s  nominees,  and  they threatened  to  shut  down  the  work  of the  Senate.  This  is  hardly  good  faith. In  fact,  it  was  a  Democrat  hold\u2014a Democrat  hold  by  the  minority  leader on  these  four  judges  who  are  put  forth by  this  President  in  accordance  with an  agreement  worked  out\u2014that  really caused  a  lot  of  angst  on  our  side,  plus the fact that these recess appointments that  were  made  without  consultation caused a lot of difficulty. Then we have virtually  every  bill  filibustered,  even on  the  motion  to  proceed.  As  a  matter of fact, the H\u20131B bill, which just passed 96\u20131,  had  three  filibusters  on  it,  from the  motion  to  proceed  right  on  up through final passage of 96\u20131. I must  respond  to  some  of  the  things Senator  said  here  this  morning. He  used  some  pretty  incendiary  language  to  imply  that  the  Senate majority  is  biased  against  Mr.  Gregory  because  he  is  an  African  American.  Senator ROBB said we  \u2018\u2018are  standing  in  the courthouse  door\u2019\u2019  and  are  refusing  to \u2018\u2018integrate\u2019\u2019  the  Fourth  Circuit.  These allegations  of  racial  bias  are  beneath the  dignity  of  a  Senator  in  the  U.S. Senate,  and  they  are  offensive  and  politically  motivated.  When  Democrats blocked  the  nomination  of  Lillian BeVier  to  the Fourth Circuit\u2014which  is what  they  did\u2014the  first  female  nominee  to  the  Fourth  Circuit,  no  one  on our side accused them of gender bias. I  am  sure  Roger  Gregory  is  a  fine man. I have no doubt about that. I have been  told  that  by  a  number  of  friends of  mine,  including  former  Secretary Coleman.  But  I  have  informed  my  colleagues that because of the atmosphere that  has  resulted  from  the  President\u2019s refusal  to  consult  with  the  Senators from  North  Carolina,  because  of  the President\u2019s  recent  recess  appointments and  disregard  of  commitments  he  had made  up  here,  and  disregard  of  the  advice  and  consent  because  of  the  petty parliamentary  games  in  which  our friends  on  the  other  side have  engaged, Mr.  Gregory\u2019s  nomination  is  not  going to move  forward. And  because  this  is  a North  Carolina  seat. We  would  have  to have  somebody  nuts,  from  North  Carolina,  who  would  not  stand  up  for  a ROBB ",
            "156": "October 3, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) S9675 September,  and  now  the  first  week  in October,  there  have  been  no  additional hearings held, or even noticed; no executive  business  meetings  have  included any judicial nominees on the agenda. I  mention  that  because  in  1992,  the last  year  of  the  Bush  administration, we  had  a  Republican  President  and  a Democratic majority in the Senate. We held  three  confirmation  hearings  in August  and  September.  We  continued to work to confirm judges. How  late  did  we  work,  even  though we  have  the  so-called  Thurmond  rule which  cuts  off  judicial  nominations after about midyear? Do you know how long  the  Democrat-controlled  Senate was confirming judges for a Republican President?  Up  to  and  including  the very  last  day  of  the  session;  not  up  to and  including  6  months  before  the  session ended. I  know  there  is  some  frustration. Some Senators have objected to Senate committees  continuing  to  meet  on other  matters  while  the  Senate  is  in session.  That  is  partly  because  the matter  is  so  acute  with  regard  to  the numerous  vacancies  in  our  court  of  appeals and the qualified women and men who have been nominated and stalled. The  chairman  says,  and  he  holds  the banner  for  his  party,  that  Democrats have  no  grounds  to  complain.  I  remind the  Senate  of  the  hoops  that  Richard Paez  and  Marsha  Berzon  had  to  jump through  in  order  to  get  a  vote,  including  the  extraordinary  step  of  overcoming  a  motion  to  postpone  indefinitely the vote on Marsha Berzon. So  I  hope  we  will  continue  to  meet our  responsibility  to  all  nominees\u2014 men,  women,  and  minorities.  As  long as  the  Senate  is  in  session,  I  am  going to  urge  action.  Highly  qualified  nominees should not be delayed. The Senate should  join  with  the  President  to  confirm  well-qualified,  diverse,  and  fairminded nominees  to  fulfill  the needs of the Federal  courts  around  the  country. I  see  my  friend  from  Arizona  on  the floor.  I  have  spoken  somewhat  longer than  I  suggested  to him  that  I would.  I apologize  for  that,  but  I  hope  he  will take  some  comfort  from  the  fact  that as  I  said  at  the  beginning  of  my  talk that  I  would  vote  for  the  nominees from  his  State,  including  one  who  has been  a  long-time  friend  of  his.  I  am going  to  be  urging  Members  on  this side  to  do  so.  I  can  say  with  some  certitude, all four will be confirmed. Mr.  President,  I  reserve  the  remainder of my time and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Arizona. Mr.  KYL. Mr.  President,  I  appreciate those  remarks  of  the  distinguished ranking member  of  the Judiciary Committee.  It  is  probably  a  good  segue  for me  to  try  to  explain  what  has  been going  on  here  because  colleagues  who may be watching or people who are not in  the  Senate  may  be  wondering  what all  of  the  discussion  has  been  about when  there  are  four  specific  nominees who  President  Clinton  has  nominated for Federal district judgeships and they Senare  ostensibly  being  considered  by  the Senate  and  I  have  heard  no  discussion about  the  four.  So  I  am  going  to  discuss the four very briefly. The  problem,  as  you  have  heard,  is that  many  on  the  other  side  of  the aisle  are  unhappy  with  the  fact  that other  nominees  have  not  been  considered  this  year.  You  have  heard  all  the discussion  about  that.  You  have  heard Senator HATCH on our side explain why that is so. But there has been great displeasure  on  the  other  side  because,  in their  view,  not  all  the  nominees  they would  have  liked  to  have  considered were considered. The  four  nominees  who  are  before  us today  are  the  only  four  the Senate  can consider.  They  are  the  only  nominees who have gone all  the way  through  the process  from  nomination,  ABA  clearance, FBI clearance, hearing before the Judiciary Committee, and  then  the Judiciary  Committee  having  acted  upon them  to  send  them  to  the  floor  of  the Senate.  These  are  the  only  four  on whom  the Senate can act.  I am pleased that,  today,  we  will  have  the  opportunity to do that. All four of these nominees were pending  in  July.  The  majority  leader  made a  request  of  the  minority  to  consider the  four  nominees.  That  request  was denied,  however.  So  these  four  nominees had to be held over the August recess.  Obviously,  on  our  side  we  would have much  preferred  that  the  four  confirmations could have occurred because of  the  need  to  fill  these  vacancies  for the  District  in  Arizona\u2014which  I  will refer  to  in  just  a  moment\u2014but  to which  Senator  referred.  He  acknowledges  we  have  a  significant  need in  Arizona  to  fill  these  positions.  But there was objection on his side to their consideration. So when we came back in September, the  majority  leader  again  asked  the minority  leader  for  concurrence  to bring  these  four  nominees  to  the  floor for  a  vote.  Again,  that  was  denied  by the Democratic side. People  might  ask:  Why  would  Democrats  be  objecting  to  President  Clinton\u2019s  nominees?  The  reason  has  nothing to do with their merits. As Senator pointed  out,  undoubtedly  all four  of  these  nominees  will  be  confirmed  because  they  are  all  four  very well  qualified.  The  reason  has  to  do with  the  politics  of  this  Chamber.  Because  some  Democrats  were  concerned that  not  all  of  their  people  had  been yet considered, they were going to hold up  nominees  they  perceived  to  be  important  to  me  and  to  Senator  from  Illinois,  the  home  State of the four nominees here before us. But the fact is, these people are needed  to  serve  the  people  of  the  United States of America. They were nominees of  President  Clinton.  So  the  bottom line is that it is now time for the nominations  to  be  considered  by  the  full Senate.  We  need  to  get  over  the  politics.  We  need  to  get  on  with  doing  the people\u2019s  business  and  confirm  these four  well-qualified  individuals.  I  am LEAHY LEAHY GERALD FITZHATCH FITZGERALD;  pleased  that both  the majority and minority  have  now  made  that  possible and  that  in  a  few  minutes  we  will  be able  to vote  for all of  these candidates. The  first  three  candidates  should have  been  discussed  this  morning.  I know  they  were  not.  Instead,  we  had the  discussion  that  you  have  heard. But  those  four  nominees,  as  Senator mentioned,  are  Michael  Reagan from  Illinois,  about  whom  you  will hear  a  little  more  in  a  moment  from Senator  Mary  Murguia,  a very well qualified assistant U.S. attorney  from  Arizona  who,  by  the  way,  if confirmed,  will  be  the  first  Latina  to serve  as  a  Federal  district  court  judge from Arizona; and the Honorable Susan Bolton,  a  very  distinguished  Superior Court  judge  in  Arizona.  All  three  of those  candidates  I  deem  to  be  well qualified.  I  chaired  the  hearing.  I  can certainly  attest  to  the  fact  that  the two  from  Arizona  have  the  highest qualifications. That  leaves  the  fourth  who  is  being considered separately here for reasons I will discuss in just a moment, but he is James  Teilborg.  Since  I  think  it  is  appropriate when we are going to vote on somebody  to  actually  have  a  little  discussion  about  the  individual,  I  am pleased  to  present  a  couple  of  minutes on his background here. He  was  born  and  raised  on  a  farm  in southern Colorado and was State President of the Colorado Future Farmers of America.  He  married  his  wife,  Connie, 37 years ago. They have two sons, Andy and Jay, and three granddaughters. He  and  I  attended  the  University  of Arizona  College  of  Law  beginning  in 1964.  That  is  where  I  first  met  Jim Teilborg.  I  have known  him  ever  since, and  we  have  been  close  friends.  So  I can  attest  not  only  to  his  qualifications as a fine lawyer but also as a fine individual.  He  served  in  active  duty U.S.  Air  Force  to  attend  Navigator School.  He  is  a  retired  colonel  in  the United  States  Air  Force  Reserve  after 31  years  in  the National Guard  and Reserve  service.  He  was  a  member  of  the National Guard for 7 years, a navigator on  the  C\u201397  and  KC\u201397  aircraft  and,  by the  way,  has  been  23  years  admissions counselor  for  the  U.S.  Air  Force  Academy.  I  would  also  note  for  the  entire time  I  have  been  with  the  U.S.  Congress,  Jim  Teilborg  has  chaired  my service academy committee, a huge job of  interviewing  all  the  individuals  who would  like  to  attend  one  of  our  military  service  academies:  interviewing them, making recommendations to me, and  then  for me  to  the academies. As a result  of  his  exemplary  service,  I must say  we  have  a  much  higher  than  average  rate  of  acceptance  by  the  service academies\u2014because  of  Jim  Teilborg\u2019s fine service. He  was  a  founder  of  the  law  firm  of Teilborg,  Sanders  &  Parks,  the  12th largest  law  firm  in  Arizona.  His  practice  focused  on  the  areas  of  aviation, professional  negligence,  product  liability, and complex tort litigation. The Presiding Officer will appreciate, as  a  pilot  himself,  that,  of  course,  Jim ",

We  have  heard  some  comments about  that.  Some  people  have  argued this  is  a  queuing  up  process;  we  just queue  up  whoever  is  next  in  line;  they should go next on the Senate floor. But we  know  that  cannot  happen.  If  nominees  were  only  considered  in  the  order they  were  nominated,  the  process would grind  to a halt as more qualified nominees  would  back  up  behind  questionable nominees. I  believe,  if  it  were  not  for  HATCH\u2019s  efforts,  there  would  have  been far  fewer  judges  confirmed  during  this session  of  the  Congress.  But  I  am  also sure  that  if  had  not  been chairman,  other  questionable  nominations  would  have  been  made.  Because of  this man\u2019s  integrity,  because  of  this man\u2019s  honesty,  because  of  this  man\u2019s proven  track  record,  and  because  he takes  his  job  so  seriously,  I  am  convinced  that  certain  nominations  this White  House  might  have  considered making  simply  were  never  made  and were never submitted. I  commend  Senator  for  his  efforts  in  moving  the  nominees  along, but  also  for  his  efforts  in  doing  a  thorough and complete job.

The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  objection, it is so ordered. Without Without HATCH HATCH ORRIN f NATIONAL  MAMMOGRAPHY  DAY Mr.  BIDEN.  Mr.  President,  we  are now  in  the  midst  of  National  Breast Cancer  Awareness  Month,  and  the  air has been filled with new and sometimes confusing  statistics,  new  treatment, new  research  advances,  and  everpresent warnings  about  the  seriousness of this dreaded disease. One  aspect  of  this  issue  that  is  close to my heart  is National Mammography Day\u2014a  day  to  increase  awareness  of how  routine  periodic  mammography and early diagnosis of breast cancer are responsible  for  huge  increases  in  the numbers  of  long-term  survivors  of  this disease. I  note  parenthetically  that  my  wife started  an  organization  in my  State  to increase  awareness\u2014it  is  named  after her,  not  me\u2014called  the  Breast Health  Initiative,  where  and  her BIDEN she  group of advisers bring oncology nurses and  oncologists  into  the  local  high schools  throughout  the  State  to  make young  women  in  high  school  aware  of breast health examinations and self-examination  because  the  key  to  survival is early detection. Breast cancer is now an illness not to be  feared  as  a  death  sentence  but  to  be conquered  commonly  and  routinely. This  year,  National  Mammography Day,  which  I  sponsored  years  ago,  will occur  on  Friday,  October  20.  As  in  previous  years,  the  Senate  has  adopted  a resolution  that  I  introduced  affirming this designation. This  year\u2019s  National  Mammography Day will see the beginning of a tremendous  new  advance  in  early  detection  of breast  cancer\u2014digital  mammography. This new  technique offers many advantages  over  standard  film-based  mammography.  From  the  patient\u2019s  point  of view,  the  usual  40-minute  examination time  can  be  cut  in  half,  and  the  exposure  to  radiation  can  be  reduced  in  almost all instances. For  many  women,  the  mammogram images  with  digital  technology  are considerably  more  precise.  The  digital technology  makes  it  possible  for  the radiologist  to  manipulate  the  images and  to  zoom  in  on  questionable  areas, thus providing more accurate diagnosis in  reducing  the  need  for  repeat  examinations. The  digital  technology  does  away with the cost and the disposal problems as well of x-ray film. In  addition,  the  retrieval  of  prior film  for  comparison  with  current  images  no  longer  require  the  time-consuming  manual  search  through  an  xray room. Finally,  by  switching  to  the  digital approach, this new technique allows all future  advances  in  digital  computer technology  to  be  applied  directly  to saving women from breast cancer. It  is  impossible,  in my  view,  to  overstate  the  importance  of  this  digital technique\u2019s  adaptability  to  new  technological  advances.  Those  of  us  old enough  to  remember  how  the  first  personal  computers  were  a  huge  advance over  the  slide  rule  are  also  aware  of how  the  incredible  subsequent  advances  in  computer  technology  meant that  those  first  PCs  were  now  useful only  as  doorstops.  I  look  forward  to  a similarly rapid advance  in the new digital  technology  as  it  moves  into  the field of breast cancer diagnosis. Digital  mammography  is  a  revolutionary  technology  that  must  be  offered  to  seniors  and  disabled  who  obtain  their  medical  care  through  Medicare.  And  it  should  be  done  as  soon  as possible.  I  strongly  encourage  the Health  Care  Financing  Administration to  evaluate  this  product  expeditiously and  to  set  appropriate  payment  rates under the Medicare program. What  I  don\u2019t  want  to  see  happen\u2014I realize  this  may  seem  somewhat  premature\u2014is  that  digital  mammography is only available for those who are able to  pay,  while  all  those  on  Medicare  or Medicaid,  because  the  reimbursement cost  is  not  sufficient  to  cover  a  digital mammography,  will  have  to  settle  for what  will  prove  to  be  an  inferior  test. The lives of many women who have yet to  discover  they  have  breast  cancer may hang in the balance. Therefore,  I  look  forward  to  HCFA establishing  a  reasonable  price  at which  reimbursement  can  be  made under  Medicare  for  those  women  on Medicare  or  Medicaid  who  seek  a breast  examination  by  use  of  digital mammography,  the  new  emerging science,  rather  than  one  that  is  film based.

            "172": "October 3, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) S9691 repesent  a  diverse  array  of  the  American  workforce\u2014everything  from  production  workers  on  the  line  to  engineers and scientists. And they are from across this great nation. The message these union officials had was  that  they  understood  that  China was  a  burgeoning  market  for  U.S.  exports. They understood  that  if  the U.S. did  not  approve  PNTR  for  China  that we  would  not  only  lose  the  trade  concessions  they  have  made  to  us  under this  agreement,  but  we  would  also  lose our  ability  to  gain  greater  market  access  and  share.  And  they  understood that  the  largest  beneficiary  of  such  an outcome  would  be  our  trade  competitors  in  the  European  Community,  in the rest of Asia, and in South America. They  understood  that  one  of  the  best ways to guarantee that American firms remain  in  the  United  States\u2014employing  American  workers  and  bolstering our economic growth\u2014was to eliminate the  existing  trade  barriers  that  have served to up until now to freeze out our products  or  force  U.S.  companies  to move facilities over to China. Without  removing  these  barriers  and liberalizing  trade  between  the U.S.  and China, American  firms  seeking  to compete  with  their  foreign  competitors would  have  every  incentive  to  move their  factories  and  operations  over  to China.  With  PNTR  and  China\u2019s  entry into  the  World  Trading  Organization we  increase  the  likelihood  that  American companies will continue to remain located  in  the  United  States.  And  that is good news  for  the union workers and households  in  the  state  of  Michigan which  will  continue  to  produce  a  wide array  of  goods  that  will  be  exported  to China. As  I  pointed  out  in  a  statement  I made  on  the  floor  supporting  PNTR, exports  from  Michigan  to  China  increased  25  percent  between  1993  and 1998,  and  they  have  undoubtedly  grown significantly  greater  since  1998.  Exports  to  China  from  businesses  located in  the Flint and Lansing areas grew by 84  percent  during  that  period.  Meanwhile,  exports  to  China  from  Kalamazoo and Battle Creek grew by an extraordinary  353 percent! Not all of  that business  is  going  to  union  shops,  but certainly  a  significant  portion  of  it  is, and  that  sort  of  expansion  in  trade with China is going to benefit all workers  and  businesses  in  Michigan\u2014union and non-union. Clearly  the  majority  of  unions  and union members in this country opposed PNTR  for  China.  I  heard  from  and spoke  with  many,  many  such  workers from Michigan\u2014both  back  in Michigan and  when  the  unions  have  come  out  to Washington,  DC,  to  meet  with  their representatives  in  Congress.  I  come from  a  union  background  and  grew  up in  a  union  household.  I  took  their  concerns  very  seriously  in  weighing  the many  issues  that  went  into  my  ultimate  decision  to  vote  for  PNTR.  And  I have pledged to hold China accountable for  their  future  behavior  and  to  fulfill their  trade  obligations  under  the I  rise we HATCH\u2019s WTO\u2019s  rules  and  the  agreement  have negotiated with them. But  there  are  indeed  unions\u2014rankand-file  members  and  leadership alike\u2014who  see  the  opportunity  presented  by  PNTR  and  allowing  China into  the  WTO  as  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  the  United  States  to  continue  to  lead  the  world  in  productivity and in our economic strength. They are prepared  to answer  the challenge posed by the global economy and the opening of  China\u2019s markets,  and  they  recognize the  benefits  which  will  result  if  we  are leading  the  way  into  opening  China  to greater  trade  instead  of  sitting  on  the sidelines  allowing  our  trade  competitors to reap all the benefits. We  should  not  forget  that  the U.S.  is a  very  diverse  country  and  that  no  institution\u2014including  organized  labor\u2014 is  a  monolithic  force.  There  are  folks on  both  sides  of  the  issue,  each  feeling very  strongly  and  very  sincerely  that they  are  doing  what  is  best  for  them and their brethren. Mr.  EDWARDS.  Mr.  President,  today  in  support  of  Senator  resolution  commemorating  our  Olympic  athletes  for  the  spirit,  enthusiasm and  patriotism  they  displayed  in  Sydney at the XXVII Summer Games. I am proud  to  represent  a  state  that  sent  to Sydney  two  of  the  nation\u2019s  most  recognizable  athletes,  Marion  Jones  and Mia  Hamm,  as  well  as  numerous  other athletes  who  valiantly  competed  in these Olympic games. The  nation\u2019s  eyes  were  on  Marion Jones as she set out to win an unprecedented  five  gold  medals  in  Sydney. While Marion  didn\u2019t win  five  golds,  she made  us  all  proud  with  her  commanding  performance.  She  set  a  track and  field  record  by  winning more medals in a single Olympics than any other woman  in  history.  Her  three  gold  and two  bronze  medals  have  put  Marion atop  the  track  and  field  world.  More important  than  winning  her  events, Marion  accepted  each  of  her  medals with  grace  and  style,  epitomizing what Olympic competition is all about. Mia  Hamm  has  captivated  children and adults alike with her charisma and passion  for  the  game  of  soccer.  Thousands  of  girls  across  North  Carolina take  to  the  soccer  fields  in  hopes  of being  the  next  Mia  Hamm.  Watching Mia  play  in  Sydney,  I  understand  why. In  the  women\u2019s  soccer  semifinals against  Brazil, Mia was  pushed,  shoved and  thrown  to  the  ground  time  and time again. She did not once complain, letting  her  actions  speak  louder  than words  by  scoring  the  only  goal  of  the match.  The  United  States  Women\u2019s Soccer  team  went  on  to  claim  the  silver medal,  led  by  other  Tar  Heels  such as  goal  keeper  Siri Mullinix  of  Greensboro and Carla Overbeck of Chapel Hill. I  am  also  extremely  proud  of  other North  Carolinians  who  competed  in Sydney.  While  these  athletes  haven\u2019t received  the  attention  Mia  Hamm  and Marion  Jones  have,  they  are  equally important  and  should  be  commended for  their  accomplishments.

Mr.  President,  I  rise today  to  express  my  support  for  the strong  partnership  between  localities and  the  federal  government  in  preventing  crime  across  the  United States.  As  my  colleagues  may  know, October  is  recognized  as  \u2018\u2018National Crime Prevention Month.\u2019\u2019 Earlier  this year,  the Federal Bureau of  Investigation  announced  that  serious  crime  had  declined  nationally  for the  eighth  consecutive  year.  Although many  reasons  for  this  promising  news can  be  cited,  I  believe  the  efforts  of state  and  local  governments  have caused  a  reduction  in  crime  rates.  To ensure  continued  success,  the  federal government  should  not  impose  additional  mandates  upon  local  communities  that will  only  prevent  the  development  of  effective  crime  prevention programs. During  this  session  of  the  106th  Congress,  I  am  pleased  to  have  worked with Minnesota\u2019s public safety officials on  a  number  of  crime  and  drug  abuse prevention  initiatives.  Most  importantly,  I  am  pleased  that  the  Fiscal Year 2001 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill  includes  $4 million  for the  State  of  Minnesota  to  develop  a statewide  computer  network  that  will provide  judicial  and  law  enforcement agencies  with  universal  access  to  critical information about criminal offenders at the time of their arrest, prosecution,  sentencing,  and  during  other  important proceedings. Information is the key  to  an  effective  and  accountable criminal  justice  system.  The  Minnesota  Legislature  recently  enacted legislation,  known  as  \u2018\u2018Katie\u2019s  Law,\u2019\u2019 that  provides  state  funding  for  the  development of this initiative. I also believe it is essential that Congress  do more  to  ensure  that  anti-drug resources  reach  the  areas  of  our  country  where  drug  abuse  and  crime  is  on the  rise  and  the  anti-drug  resources  of state  and  local  law  enforcement  have been seriously strained. That is the situation facing law enforcement agencies ",
            "180": "October 3, 2000 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:84)(cid:69) S9699 schools  that  set  the  standard  for which others strive. I am very proud to report that  nine  of  the  198  Blue  Ribbon Schools  named  by  Secretary  Richard W. Riley for 1999\u20132000 are located in the State  of  Michigan,  and  I  rise  today  to recognize  Cousino  High  School  in Warren,  Michigan,  one  of  these  nine schools. Cousino  High  School  is  a  contemporary  American  high  school  set amongst  the  \u2018\u2018Big  Three\u2019\u2019  members  of the  auto  industry\u2014General  Motors, Ford  Motor  Company  and DaimlerChrysler.  Much  of  the  instructional  program  at  Cousino  relies  upon the  same  forces  that  drive  these  international  automotive  giants,  a  fact which  can  be  attributed  to  the  large participation  of  the  Warren  community  in  the  affairs  of  Cousino  High School.  Teachers,  administrators,  and parents,  along  with  nearly  300  leaders from  local  business  and  industry,  are directly  involved  in  shaping  the  educational  program.  This  involvement has  been  instrumental  in  creating  the high  student  achievement  level  that has  become  a  trademark  of  Cousino High School. A  large  part  of  this  program  is  devoted  to  ensuring  that  students  who graduate  Cousino  High  School  leave tecnologically  competent.  All  Cousino classes  use  technology  as  a  tool  to  facilitate  learning.  Multiple  computer labs  spread  throughout  the  building and  additional  computers  in  the media center  and  classrooms  allow  students to  easily  access  the  Internet.  In  addition,  Cousino\u2019s  proximity  to  the  General  Motors  Technical  Center,  the world\u2019s  largest  auto  research  institute, and  the  satellite  automotive  and  technical  businesses  nearby,  have  provided students  with  an  opportunity  to  see first-hand  the  many  doors  that  their education  will  open  for  them.  This focus  on  technology  has  complemented the  core  subjects  of  literature, humanitites,  philosophy  and  the  arts to  provide  students  with  a  well-balanced educational foundation. Of course, no school could be successful  without  students  and  parents  who are  willing  to  devote  time  and  energy to  see  that  their  school  is  indeed  successful.  This  dedication  has  occurred time and again at Cousino High School. Parents  have  consistently  served  on the  Principal\u2019s  Advisory  Committee and School Improvement Plan committees, have volunteered in Booster Clubs and  for  other  school  activities,  and helped  to  promote  school  spirit  by  promoting school events. This parental enthusiasm  has  rubbed  off  onto  students of Cousino High. Over 80 percent of students participate in extracurricular activities,  and  students  have  led  the  way in  aiding  the  community  as  a  whole, working  tirelessly  for  numerous  charities. I  applaud  the  students,  parents,  faculty  and  administration  of  Cousino High  School,  for  I  believe  this  is  an award  which  speaks  more  to  the  effort of  a  united  community  than  it  does  to the  work  of  a  few  individuals.  With that  having  been  said,  I  would  like  to recognize Mr.  Joseph  Sayers,  Principal of  Cousino  High  School,  whose  dedication  to  making  his  school  one  of  the finest  in  our  Nation  has  been  instrumental in creating this community. On behalf  of  the  entire United  States  Senate,  I  congratulate  Cousino  High School  on  being  named  a  Blue  Ribbon School  for  1999\u20132000,  and  wish  the school  continued  success  in  the  future.\u2022 f MESSAGES  FROM  THE  PRESIDENT Messages  from  the  President  of  the United  States  were  communicated  to the  Senate  by  Ms.  Evans,  one  of  his secretaries.

The  15-percent  wage  credit  generally  is  effective  for  qualifying  wages  paid  after  December 31, 2001. With respect to the two additional Round I empowerment zones, however, the  wage  credit  is  effective  for  qualifying wages paid after December 31, 2004. The  30  new  renewal  zones  must  be  designated  by January  1,  2002,  and  the  resulting tax  benefits  will  be  available  for  the  period beginning  January  1,  2002,  and  ending  December 31, 2009. B. FUNDING FOR ZONES ROUND II EMPOWERMENT THE BILL) (SEC. 116 OF The  provision  provides  a  one-time  grant  in fiscal year  2001 of  $5,000,000  for each of  the  15 urban  empowerment  zones  designated  pursuant  to  the  Taxpayer  Relief  Act  of  1997,  and $2,000,000  for  each  of  the  5  rural  empowerment  zones  designated  pursuant  to  the  Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The  provision  also  provides  a  one-time grant  $250,000  for  each  of  the  remaining Round  I  enterprise  communities  (i.e.,  those that have not become empowerment zones). generally  refers  to  certain  enterprise  zone businesses  within  the  D.C.  Zone.  For  purposes  of  the  zero-percent  capital  gains  rate, the D.C. Zone is defined to include all census tracts within the District of Columbia where the  poverty  rate  is  not  less  than  10  percent as determined on the basis of the 1990 Census (sec. 1400B(d)). EXPLANATION OF PROVISION The  provision  eliminates  the  10-percent poverty  rate  limitation  for  purposes  of  the zero-percent  capital  gains  rate.  Thus,  the zero-percent  capital  gains  rate  applies  to capital  gains  from  the  sale  of  assets  held more  than  five  years  attributable  to  certain qualifying  businesses  located  in  the  District of Columbia. EFFECTIVE DATE The  provision  is  effective  for  D.C.  Zone business  stock  and  partnership  interests originally  issued  after,  and  D.C.  Zone  business  property  assets  originally  acquired  by the taxpayer after, December 31, 2000. 3.  Gross  Income  Test  for  D.C.  Zone  Businesses (Sec. 123 of the Bill and Sec. 1400B of the Code) OF DISTRICT OF PRESENT LAW C. EXTENSION AND EXPANSION COLUMBIA ENTERPRISE ZONE (\u2018\u2018D.C. ZONE\u2019\u2019) 1. Extension of D.C. Zone (Sec. 121 of the Bill and Secs. 1400 and 1400A of the Code) PRESENT LAW The  1997  Act  designated  certain  economically  depressed  census  tracts within  the District of Columbia as the District of Columbia Enterprise  Zone  (the  \u2018\u2018D.C.  Zone\u2019\u2019),  within which businesses and individual residents are eligible  for  special  tax  incentives.  The  D.C. Zone  designation  remains  in  effect  for  the period  from  January  1,  1998,  through December  31,  2002.  In addition  to  the  tax  incentives available with respect to a Round I empowerment zone (including a wage credit), the D.C. Zone  also  has  a  zero-percent  capital  gains rate that applies to gain from the sale of certain qualified D.C. Zone assets acquired after December 31, 1997 and held for more than five years. With  respect  to  the  tax-exempt  financing incentives, the D.C. Zone generally is treated like a Round I empowerment zone; therefore, the  issuance  of  such  bonds  is  subject  to  the District  of  Columbia\u2019s  annual  private  activity bond volume limitation. However, the aggregate face amount of all outstanding qualified  enterprise  zone  facility  bonds  per  qualified  D.C.  Zone  business  may  not  exceed  $15 million (rather than $3 million, as is the case for Round I empowerment zones). EXPLANATION OF PROVISION The  provision  extends  the  D.C.  Zone  designation  through December  31,  2006. The provision  also  conforms  the  D.C.  zone  wage credit  to  the  wage  credit  for  existing  empowerment  zones,  so  that  a  15-percent  wage credit  applies  with  respect  to  qualifying wages  beginning  in  2003  (and  ending  on  December 31, 2006). EFFECTIVE DATE The  provision  extending  the  designation  is effective  after  the  date  of  enactment.  For the  D.C.  Enterprise  Zone,  the  15-percent wage  credit  is  effective  for  qualifying  wages paid after December 31, 2002. 2.  Extension  of  Zero-Percent  Capital  Rate  for  D.C.  Zone  Assets  (Sec.  122  Bill and Sec. 1400B of the Code) Gains of  the PRESENT LAW Present law provides a zero-percent capital gains  rate  for  capital  gains  from  the  sale  of certain  qualified  D.C.  Zone  assets  held  for more  than  five  years.  In  general,  a  \u2018\u2018D.C. Zone  asset\u2019\u2019  means  stock  or  partnership  interests  held  in,  or  tangible  assets  held  by,  a D.C.  Zone  business.  A  D.C.  Zone  business A zero-percent capital gains rate applies to gain  from  the  sale  of  certain  qualified  D.C. zone  assets.  In  general,  a  D.C.  Zone  asset means stock or partnership interests held in, or  tangible  property  held  by,  a  D.C.  Zone business.  A  D.C.  Zone  business  generally  refers  to  certain  enterprise  zone  businesses within  the  D.C.  Zone,  except  that  80  percent of  the  total  gross  income  of  the  entity must be  derived  from  the  active  conduct  of  the business (sec. 1400B(c)(2)). EXPLANATION OF PROVISION The provision reduces the  level of gross  income  needed  to  qualify  as  a  D.C.  Zone  business to 50 percent. EFFECTIVE DATE The  provision  is  effective  for  D.C.  Zone business  stock  and  partnership  interest originally  issued  after,  and  D.C.  Zone  business property originally acquired by the taxpayer after, December 31, 2000. 4.  Expansion  of  District  of  Columbia  Homebuyer  Tax  Credit  (Sec.  124  of  the  Bill  and Sec. 1400C of the Code) PRESENT LAW First-time  homebuyers  of  a  principal  residence in the District of Columbia are eligible for  a  nonrefundable  tax  credit  of  up  to  $5,000 of  the  amount  of  the  purchase  price.  The $5,000  maximum  credit  applies  both  to  individuals  and  married  couples.  Married  individuals  filing  separately  can  claim  a  maximum credit of $2,500 each. The credit phases out  for  individual  taxpayers  with  adjusted gross  income  between  $70,000  and  $90,000 ($110,000-$130,000  for  joint  filers).  For  purposes  of  eligibility,  \u2018\u2018first-time  homebuyer\u2019\u2019 means  any  individual  if  such  individual  did not  have  a  present  ownership  interest  in  a principal  residence  in  the  District  of  Columbia in the one year period ending on the date of the purchase of the residence to which the credit  applies.  The  credit  is  scheduled  to  expire  for residences purchased after December 31, 2001. EXPLANATION OF PROVISION The provision extends  the  first-time homebuyer  credit  for  two  years,  through  December  31,  2003.  The  provision  also  extends  the phase-out  range  for  married  individuals  filing  a  joint  return  so  that  it  is  twice  that  of individuals.  Thus,  under  the  provision,  the District  of  Columbia  homebuyer  credit  is phased  out  for  joint  filers  with  adjusted gross income between $140,000 and $180,000. EFFECTIVE DATE The provision  is  effective  for  taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000. D. NEW THE MARKETS TAX BILL AND NEW PRESENT LAW CREDIT SEC. 45D OF (SECTION THE CODE) 131 OF Some  tax  incentives  are  available  to  taxpayers making investments and loans in lowincome  communities.  For  example,  tax  incentives  are  available  to  taxpayers  that  invest in specialized small business investment companies  licensed  by  the  Small  Business Administration  to  make  loans  to,  or  equity investments  in,  small  businesses  owned  by persons who are socially or economically disadvantaged. EXPLANATION OF PROVISION The  provision  creates  a  new  tax  credit  for qualified  equity  investments  made  to  acquire  stock  in  a  selected  community  development  entity  (\u2018\u2018CDE\u2019\u2019).  The  maximum  annual  amount  of  qualifying  equity  investments is capped as follows: Calendar  year Maximum  qualifying  investment equity 2002 .................................................................. 2003\u20132006 ........................................................ $1.0  billion 1.5  billion  per  year The amount of the new tax credit to the investor  (either  the  original  purchaser  or  a subsequent holder) is (1) a five-percent credit for  the  year  in  which  the  equity  interest  is purchased  from  the  CDE  and  the  first  two anniversary  dates  after  the  interest  is  purchased  from  the  CDE,  and  (2)  a  six-percent credit  on  each  anniversary  date  thereafter for  the  following  four  years.  The  taxpayer\u2019s basis  in  the  investment  is  reduced  by  the amount  of  the  credit  (other  than  for  purposes  of  calculating  the  zero-percent  capital gains  rules  and  section  1202).  The  credit  is subject  to  the  general  business  credit  rules. A  CDE  is  any  domestic  corporation  or partnership  (1)  whose  primary  mission  is serving  or  providing  investment  capital  for low-income  communities  or  low-income  persons,  (2)  that  maintains  accountability  to residents  of  low-income  communities through  the  representation  of  the  residents on  governing  or  advisory  boards  of  the  CDE, and  (3)  is  certified  by  the  Treasury  Department  as  an  eligible  CDE.  No  later  than  120 days  after  enactment,  the  Treasury  Department will issue guidance that specifies objective  criteria  to  be  used  by  the  Treasury  to allocate  the  credits  among  eligible  CDEs.  In allocating  the  credits,  the  Treasury  Department  will  give  priority  to  entities  with records  of  having  successfully  provided  capital  or  technical  assistance  to  disadvantaged businesses  or  communities,  as  well  as  to  entities  that  intend  to  invest  substantially  all of  the  proceeds  they  receive  from  their  investors  in  businesses  in  which  persons  unrelated  to  the  CDE  hold  the  majority  equity interest. If a CDE fails to sell equity interests to investors  up  to  the  amount  authorized  within five  years  of  the  authorization,  then  the  remaining  authorization  is  canceled.  The Treasury  Department  can  authorize  another CDE  to  issue  equity  interests  for  the  unused portion.  No  authorization  can  be  made  after 2013. A  \u2018\u2018qualified  equity  investment\u2019\u2019  is  defined as stock or a similar equity interest acquired directly  from  a  CDE  in  exchange  for  cash. Substantially  all  of  the  investment  proceeds must be used by  the CDE  to make  \u2018\u2018qualified low-income community  investments.\u2019\u2019 Qualified  low-income  community  investments  include: (1) capital or equity investments in, or loans  to,  qualified  active  businesses  located in  low-income  communities,  (2)  certain  financial  counseling  and  other  services  specified  in  regulations  to  businesses  and  residents  in  low-income  communities,  (3)  the purchase  from  another  CDE  of  any  loan made  by  such  entity  that  is  a  qualified  low ",

That portion of the building is to be occupied exclusively  by  the  lessee  (or  any  sublessee). The  original  use  of  the  qualified  leasehold improvement  property  must  begin  with  the lessee,  and  must  begin  after  December  31, 2006.  The  improvement  must  be  placed  in service more  than  three  years  after  the  date the building was first placed in service. Qualified  leasehold  improvement  property does  not  include  any  improvement  for which the  expenditure  is  attributable  to  the  enlargement  of  the  building,  any  elevator  or escalator, any  structural component benefitting  a  common  area,  or  the  internal  structural framework of the building. No special rule is specified for the class life of qualified leasehold improvement property. Therefore, the general rule that the class life for nonresidential  real and  residential  rental property is 40 years applies. For  purposes  of  the  provision,  a  commitment  to  enter  into  a  lease  is  treated  as  a lease, and the parties to the commitment are treated  as  lessor  and  lessee,  provided  the lease  is  in  effect  at  the  time  the  qualified leasehold  improvement  property  is  placed  in service.  A  lease  between  related  persons  is not considered a lease for this purpose. EFFECTIVE DATE The  provision  is  effective  for  leasehold  improvement  property  service after December 31, 2006. IV. TAX RELIEF FOR FARMERS A. FARM, FISH, AND (\u2018\u2018FFARRM ACCOUNTS\u2019\u2019) (SEC. 401 SEC.  468C  qualified placed  in RANCH RISK MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTS OF THE BILL CODE) AND NEW OF THE PRESENT LAW There  ing  the  income. is no  provision  in  present  elective  deferral  of  farm  law  allowor  fishing EXPLANATION OF PROVISION The bill allows taxpayers engaged in an eligible  business  to  establish  FFARRM  accounts.  An  eligible  business  is  any  trade  or business  of  farming  in  which  the  taxpayer actively  participates,  including  the  operation  of  a  nursery  or  sod  farm  or  the  raising or  harvesting  of  crop-bearing  or  ornamental trees.  An  eligible  business  also  is  the  trade or  business  of  commercial  fishing  as  that term  is  defined  under  section  (3)  of  the Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and Management  Act  (16  U.S.C.  1802)  and  includes the trade or business of catching, taking  or  harvesting  fish  that  are  intended  to enter  commerce  through  sale,  barter  or trade. Contributions  to  a  FFARRM  account  are deductible  and  are  limited  to  20  percent  of the  taxable  income  that  is  attributable  to the  eligible  business. The  deduction  is  taken into  account  in  determining  adjusted  gross income  and  reduces  the  income  attributable to  the  eligible  business  for  all  income  tax purposes other than the determination of the 20  percent  of  eligible  income  limitation  on contributions  to  a  FFARRM  account.  Contributions  to  a  FFARRM  account  do  not  reduce  earnings  from  self-employment.  Accordingly,  distributions  are  not  included  in self-employment income. A  FFARRM  account  is  taxed  as  a  grantor trust and any earnings are required to be distributed  currently.  Thus,  any  income  earned in  the  FFARRM  account  is  taxed  currently to  the  farmer  or  fisherman  who  established the account. Amounts can remain on deposit in  a  FFARRM  account  for  up  to  five  years. Any amount that has not been distributed by the  close  of  the  fourth  year  following  the year  of  deposit  is  deemed  to  be  distributed and  includible  in  the  gross  income  of  the  account owner. EFFECTIVE DATE The provision  is  effective  for  taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000. B. EXCLUSION TAX THE OF RENTAL INCOME BILL OF THE AND FROM SECA 1402  (SEC.  402  SEC.

Net  earnings  from  self-employment generally means  gross  income  (including  the individual\u2019s  net  distributive  share  of  partnership  income)  derived  by  an  individual from  any  trade  or  business  carried  on  by  the individual less applicable deductions. One exclusion  from  net  earnings  from  self  employment  involves  certain  real  estate  rentals. Under  this  rule,  net  earnings  from  self  employment  do  not  include  income  from  the rental  of  real  estate  and  from  personal  property  leased  with  the  real  estate  unless  the rental  income  is  received  under  an  arrangement between an owner or tenant of land and another  individual  that  provides:  (1)  such other  individual  shall  produce  agricultural or  horticultural  commodities  on  such  land; and  (2)  there  shall  be  material  participation by  the  owner  or  tenant  with  respect  to  any such  agricultural  or  horticultural  commodities.  Other  rules  apply  to  rental  payments received by an individual in the course of the individual\u2019s trade or business as a real estate dealer. EXPLANATION OF PROVISION The  bill  provides  that  net  earnings  from self  employment do not  include  income  from the  rental  of  real  estate  under  a  lease  agreement  (rather  than  an  arrangement)  between an owner or  tenant of  land and another  individual which provides that: (1) such other individual  shall  produce  agricultural  or  horticultural  commodities  on  such  land;  and  (2) there  shall  be  material  participation  by  the owner  or  tenant  in  the  production  or  management  of  the  production  of  such  agricultural or horticultural commodities.

A  recent  court  decision found  that  payments  made  under  the  conservation  reserve  program  are  includible  in an  individual\u2019s  self-employment  income  for purposes of SECA tax. EXPLANATION OF PROVISION The  bill  provides  that  net  earnings  from self-employment do not include conservation reserve program payments for SECA.

Private  activity bonds  on  which  interest  may  be  tax-exempt include bonds issued to finance loans to firsttime  farmers  for  the  acquisition  of  land  and certain equipment (\u2018\u2018aggie bonds\u2019\u2019).

MODIFICATIONS TO BILL THE AND SECTION 512(b)(13) (SEC. SEC. 512 OF 405 OF THE CODE) PRESENT LAW In  general,  interest,  rents,  royalties  and annuities  are  excluded  from  the  unrelated business  income  (\u2018\u2018UBI\u2019\u2019) of tax-exempt organizations.  However,  section  512(b)(13)  treats otherwise  excluded  rent,  royalty,  annuity, and  interest  income as UBI  if such  income  is received  from  a  taxable  or  tax-exempt  subsidiary  that  is  50  percent  controlled  by  the parent  tax-exempt  organization.  In  the  case of  a  stock  subsidiary,  \u2018\u2018control\u2019\u2019  means  ownership  by  vote  or  value  of  more  than  50  percent  of  the  stock.  In  the  case  of  a  partnership  or  other  entity,  control  means  ownership  of  more  than  50  percent  of  the  profits, capital  or  beneficial  interests.  In  addition, present  law  applies  the  constructive  ownership  rules  of  section  318  for  purposes  of  section 512(b)(13). Thus, a parent exempt organization is deemed to control any subsidiary in which  it  holds  more  than  50  percent  of  the voting  power  or  value,  directly  (as  in  the case  of  a  first-tier  subsidiary)  or  indirectly (as in the case of a second-tier subsidiary). Under  present  law,  interest,  rent,  annuity, or  royalty  payments  made  by  a  controlled entity  to  a  tax-exempt  organization  are  includible  in  the  latter  organization\u2019s UBI  and are  subject  to  the unrelated  business  income tax  to  the  extent  the  payment  reduces  the net  unrelated  income  (or  increases  any  net unrelated loss) of the controlled entity. The  Taxpayer  Relief  Act  of  1997  (the  \u2018\u20181997 Act\u2019\u2019)  made  several  modifications,  as  described  above,  to  the  control  requirement  of section  512(b)(13).  In  order  to  provide  transitional  relief,  the  changes  made  by  the  1997 Act do not apply to any payment received or accrued  during  the  first  two  taxable  years beginning  on  or  after  the  date  of  enactment of  the  1997  Act  (August  5,  1997)  if  such  payment  is  received  or  accrued  pursuant  to  a binding written  contract  in  effect  on  June  8, 1997,  and  at  all  times  thereafter  before  such payment  (but  not  pursuant  to  any  contract provision  that  permits  optional  accelerated payments). EXPLANATION OF PROVISION The  bill  provides  that  interest,  rent,  annuity,  or  royalty  payments  made  by  a  controlled  subsidiary  to  a  tax-exempt  parent  is not Unrelated Business  Income except to the extent  that  such  payments  exceed  arm\u2019s length  values,  as  determined  under  sec.  482 principles.

Mr.  President,  I  rise  to express  my  strong  support  for  the  Airport Security Improvement Act of 2000, S.  2440.  This  bill  was  introduced  in April  by  Senator  and  cosponsored  by  several  other  Senators, including  myself.  In  June,  the  Commerce Committee favorably reported S. 2440,  which  was  crafted  to  address  several  serious  concerns  associated  with aviation security in this country. The  bill  was  introduced  in  the  wake of  an  Aviation  Subcommittee  hearing chaired  by  Senator  on  the current  state  of  aviation  security. Prior  to  the hearing,  the Federal Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  the General  Accounting  Office  (GAO)  conducted a closed briefing with respect to some of the more sensitive information in  this  area.  Given  concerns  raised  by the GAO and  the Department of Transportation\u2019s  Inspector  General,  a  consensus  developed  that  legislation  was needed  to  address  some  of  the  more glaring  deficiencies  in  the  current  system. As reported by the committee, S. 2440 would  do  the  following:  require  criminal  history  records  checks  for  all  baggage  and  security  checkpoint  screeners;  expand  the  list  of  criminal  convictions  that  disqualify  an  individual from  being  employed  as  a  security screener;  increase  the  amount  of  classroom  and  on-the-job  training  required of  airline  security  screeners;  require the  FAA  to  work  with  air  carriers  and airport  operators  to  strengthen  procedures  to  prevent  unauthorized  access to  aircraft;  hold  security  personnel  individually  responsible  for  security lapses  through  progressive  disciplinary measures;  require  the  FAA  to  improve security  at  its  own  air  traffic  control facilities;  and  increase  random  screening of checked bags for explosives. I believe these are all necessary steps for  the  improvement  of  aviation  security. No system can ever be perfect, but we  must  continue  to  strive  for  an  air transportation system that is as secure as  reasonably  possible.  On  the  whole, security  at  U.S.  airports  appears  to  be good  at  this  time.  But,  as  I  have  said before,  we  cannot  relax  our  efforts,  especially given the significant growth in air  travel.  The  threats  to  our  nation remain  real,  and  the  airline  industry unfortunately  remains  an  attractive target. In  closing,  I  commend  Senator for  her  hard  work  on  this bill.

A  Navy  Inspector General  Report  says  Navy  fliers  are leaving  port  at  a  lower  stage  of  readiness.  The  Air  Force  reports  that  its readiness  rates  for  warplane  squadrons continues to decline. Many  units  are  on  frequent  temporary  duty  assignments  or  are  deployed  most  of  the  year  on  missions that  many  believe  are  of  questionable value.  When  the  troops  come  home, their training is shortchanged based on the  lack  of  time  available  for  training and  lack  of  resources.  Maintenance  required  for  old  equipment  takes  significant  time  away  from  other  missions, from family and it is very costly. There  is another  related problem and challenge,  that  of  morale.  There  is  a growing  uneasiness  with  military  men and women that their  leadership either does  not  care  or  is  out  of  touch  with their  problems.  By  leadership,  I  am  including  the  Congress  of  the  United States.  Soldiers,  sailors,  airmen,  marines  tell me  they  are  stressed  out  and dissatisfied and leaving. This  has  been  an  anecdotal  outpouring  from  military  commanders  in the  field  simply  fed  up  with  current quality  of  life  and  readiness  stress. Pick  up  any  service,  military  or  defense  publication  or  read  any  story  in the press and what we have is equal opportunity frustration. A  February  study  by  the  Center  for Strategic  and  International  Studies warns  us  about  \u2018\u2018stress  on  personnel and  families,  problems  with  recruiting and  retention,  and  for  some,  declining trust and confidence in the military institution and its leaders.\u2019\u2019 Half  of  the  respondents  in  the  survey said  their  unit  did  not  have  high  morale  and  two  thirds  said  stress  was  a problem.  A  recent  Army  study  at  Fort Leavenworth, the intellectual center of the  Army,  located  in  my  homes  state of  Kansas,  warned  the  number  of  lieutenants  and  captains  leaving  the Army is now over 60% compared to 48% a decade ago. In  a  survey  taken  at  Fort  Benning, outgoing  captains  complained  they were  disillusioned  with  the  Army  mission  and  lifestyle,  struggling  to  maintain  a  functional  family  life.  The American  soldier  has  gone  from  a homeland  protector  of  vital  national interests  to  nomadic  peace  keeper.  His weapons,  on  the  cutting  edge,  some complain are beginning to rust. During this time there has been quite a  transition  period  Mr.  President. Stretching  from  the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton  administrations,  military  personnel  levels  declined  by  40  percent, spending  dropped  35  percent  and meanwhile  the  number  of  U.S.  forces  stationed  abroad  increased  and  remains high. Under  Secretary  for  Defense  for  Acquisition  and  Technology,  Jacques Gansler recently stated: We  are  trapped  in  a  death  spiral.  The  requirement  to  maintain  our  aging  equipment is  costing  us more  each  year  in  repair  costs, down  time  and  maintenance  tempo.  But,  we must keep  this  equipment  in  repair  to maintain  readiness.  It  drains  our  resources\u2014resources  we  should  apply  to modernization  of the  traditional  systems  and  development  of new systems. So  we  stretch  out  our  replacement  schedules  to  ridiculous  lengths  and  reduce  the quantities  of  new  equipment  we  purchase, raising  the  cost  and  still  durther  delaying modernization. CLELAND I  am  very  concerned  if  what  I  have described  is  even  close  to  factual\u2014and I  am  afraid  it  is  based  upon  my  own conversations with the men and women of  our  military,  that  we  are  headed  in a very dangerous direction. I realize the readiness of our military has  become  an  issue  in  the  current presidential  campaign.  And,  it  is  not my  intent  to  take  sides  in  that  debate during  this  policy  forum.  I might  add  I think  in  some  ways  this  debate  is  long overdue. Another  way  to  determine  our  military  readiness  is  to  ask  those  in charge.  And,  Senator  and  I, along  with  members  of  the  Senate Armed  Services  Committee  did  just that  last week. The  joint chiefs of staff came  before  the  committee.  Not  without  some  not  so  subtle  advice  from  on high. Prior  to  the  joint  chiefs  testimony, Administration  spokesman  Kenneth Bacon  said  Defense  Secretary  Cohen told  the  Chiefs  he  expected  them  to play  straight  on  the  readiness  issue,  to give  the  facts,  not  to  \u2018\u2018beat  the  drum with  a  tin  cup\u2019\u2019  but  to  talk  honestly about  the  pressures  they  face  from  the operations  their  forces  are  undergoing. Well,  Mr.  Bacon  need  not  have  worried. The Chiefs testified and shot pretty straight. On an annual basis the Marines  said  they  needed  approximately $1.5  billion  to  be  the  fully  modernized 911  force  in  readiness  we  expect  of them. The Air Force  told us  they needed  $20  to  $30  billion,  the Navy  some  $17 billion  and  the  Army  $10  billion.  That totaled up to somewhere between $48 to $60  billion  more  the  Chiefs  feel  each service needs to perform its mission. Those  figures,  by  the  way,  compare with  a  recent  estimate  by  the Congressional Budget Office  regarding  the  cost the CBO deems necessary  to enable  the services  to  meet  their  mission  obligations. Lord  knows  what  the  Chiefs  would have  requested  if  they  had  beat  the drum with a tin cup. And, I must admit I  am  disappointed  by  the  suggestion  in Mr.  Bacon\u2019s  warning  that  the  chiefs would  ever  provide  anything  but  their honest  testimony  before  the  Congress, after  all  each  of  the  Chiefs  swore  to provide  their  honest,  candid  assessment  during  their  nomination  hearings. I always assume they do just that. With  all  of  the  pressures  of  the  current  political  season,  perhaps  Mr.  Bacon\u2019s  concern  was  understandable, after all he is a spokesman. I  brought  a  tin  cup  to  the  hearings last  week.  The  distinguished  acting Presiding  Officer  looked  with  some shock  and  amazement  as  I  had  a  tin cup  and  poured  water  into  it.  I  described  all  the  missions  that  the  military  had.  Then  I  described  what  they had  to  work  with.  I  said:  Keep  pouring the  water  and  some  water  might  come out.  In  other  words,  the  services  can\u2019t carry  all  the  water  they  were  intended to  carry.  Of  course,  what  I  didn\u2019t  say was that I had drilled a hole in the cup. Of  course,  some  of  the  water  was  coming out. But it made a good audiovisual tool. I thank the distinguished Senator for his  help.  I  didn\u2019t  bring  one  here  tonight. Don\u2019t worry. We are not going to get anybody wet. To  be  fair,  Mr.  Bacon  stated  he  believes  our  forces  are  well  equipped, trained  and  led.  I will  acknowledge  the \u2018\u2018led\u2019\u2019  part.  The  point  is  too  much  attention  has  been  placed  on  the  tip  of the spear of U.S. military might. Mr.  Bacon  is  correct,  the  Secretary of  Defense  is  correct,  and  others  are correct.  I  think  we  all  agree  that  the tip of the spear is ready. It is tough and it is lethal. But,  just  as  important  but  not  often discussed  is  the  shaft  of  the  spear. Range,  sustainability,  lethality,  accuracy and the deterrence capacity of the spear  as  a  weapon  is  greatly  reduced  if the shaft is weak or damaged. What comprises the shaft of our military readiness spear? Let  us  try  the  adequacy  of  critical air  and  sea  lift  to  sustain  the  force  or get  the  force  to  the  fight  in  a  timely manner. Let  us  try  the  adequacy  of  the  reserve  of  key  repair  parts  and  weapons inventory to sustain the battle. Let  us  talk  about  the  effectiveness and  adequacy  of  training  time  and funding. We  should  mention  the  impact  of quality  of  life  from  pay  to  health  care to  housing  on  the  warrior\u2019s  willingness\u2014and  they  are  warriors\u2014to  commit to a career in the military. We  should mention  the  impact  of  the significant  operational  tempo  of  the military  and  the  impact  that  has  on the total military spear. We  should  also  mention  the  effect  of mission  quality  and  duration  on  readiness to fight and win the nation\u2019s wars; and The  services\u2019  preparation  for  the  future,  joint  battlefield  in  an  environment  where  asymmetric  warfare  will be the norm and the battlefield may be in an urban environment. I  do  not  mean  to  pick  on  Mr.  Bacon, notwithstanding  his  comments,  the primary  purpose  of  our  military  as  defined  from  Clausewitz  to  Colin  Powell is  the  readiness  of  the  force  to  carry out the National Strategy. I have grave concerns  that  if we  look  behind  the  tip of  the  spear  of U.S. military  readiness, our forces are not ready. And, if that is banging  on  our  readiness  capability with a tin cup, so be it. The  point  is  that  we  in  the  Congress have  the  obligation  and  responsibility to  provide  the  resources  our  Armed Forces  need  to  protect  our  vital  national interests. ",
            "268": "E1652 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:69)(cid:120)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:110)(cid:115)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:115)(cid:32) (cid:111)(cid:102)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:101)(cid:109)(cid:97)(cid:114)(cid:107)(cid:115) October 3, 2000 cases,  the  burden  would  be  on  the  applicant to  rebut  the presumption of obviousness. On  procedure,  we  would  add  new  protections  at  the  beginning  and  at  the  end  of  the current  process.  Unfortunately,  the  public  rarely  knows  when  the  PTO  is  evaluating  a  proposed  business  method  patent  application, and  thus  has  no  opportunity  to  bring  prior  art and  other  information  to  the  attention  of  a  patent  examiner  or  to  argue  that  the  statutory  criteria  for  the  award  of  a  patent  is  for  other  reasons  not  met  before  it  is  too  late  to  do  any good. We,  therefore, would  require  the  PTO  to give  the  public  at  large  an  opportunity  early  in the  patent  review  process  to  submit  prior  art information  and  evidence  that  the  claimed  invention  is  already  in  public  use  or  is  obvious. In  addition,  if  asked,  the  PTO  would  be  required  to  conduct  a  proceeding  comparable  to the  discretionary  public  use  proceeding  already on  the books. At  the  end  of  the  process,  we  would  establish  an  opposition  procedure  so  that  the  public at  large  would  have  one  additional  opportunity to  challenge  the  award  of  a  business  method patent  short  of  having  to  file  a  lawsuit.  Decisions  in  these  proceedings  would  be  made  by an  administrative  opposition  judge  chosen from  a  panel  of  examiners  with  special  expertise  in evaluating business method patents. The  bill  makes  two  other  important  procedural  changes.  In  cases  involving  business method  patents,  the  burden  of  proof  on  the party  seeking  to  show  invalidity  would  be  lowered  from  the  current  \u2018\u2018clear  and  convincing evidence  standard\u2019\u2019  to  the  \u2018\u2018preponderance  of the  evidence\u2019\u2019  standard.  And  because  we share  the  concern  the  PTO  has  about  the  lack of  prior  art  being  accessible  to  examiners,  our bill  would  require  an  applicant  for  a  business method  patent  to  disclose  the  extent  to  which the applicant has  searched  for prior art. Taken  together,  these  changes  will  enable the  PTO  to  do  a  better  job  when  examining business  method  patent  applications,  and  they will  ensure  that  the  American  public  has  an opportunity  to  participate  more  fully  in  the process,  which  should  reduce  the  risk  of  the PTO  awarding  any  more  patents  on  the  patently obvious. f PERSONAL  EXPLANATION HON.  LYNN  C.  WOOLSEY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, October 3, 2000 Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Mr.  Speaker,  due  to  an event  in  my  District,  I  missed  roll  call  votes #503\u2013505.  Had  I  been  present,  I  would  have voted: Roll Call #503\u2014Yea. Roll Call #504\u2014Yea. Roll Call #505\u2014No. Regarding  H.R.  3088,  I  wholeheartedly agree  that  victims  of  rape  should  be  able  to learn  whether  their  assailant  could  have passed  on  the  HIV  virus  to  them.  That\u2019s  why I  support  addressing  this  issue  in  the  Violence Against  Women  Act,  and  support  women  who have  been  raped  and  want  to  undergo  an  HIV test.  However,  H.R.  3088  could  force  innocent individuals  to  undergo  HIV  tests  and  have  that information  involuntarily  disclosed  to  others. This Congress  should not  force  the accused  to undergo  an  HIV  test  until  he  has  been  proven guilty.  Under  this  legislation,  an  individual  who is  indicted  and  may  be  able  to  prove  his  innocence  would  still  be  forced  to  undergo  an  HIV test.  This  bill  has  not  been  considered  by  the Judiciary  Committee,  and  I  believe  that  it strongly  violates  the  principle  that  Americans are  innocent until proven guilty. f PRIVACY  COMMISSION  ACT SPEECH OF HON.  PATSY  T.  MINK OF HAWAII IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, October 2, 2000 Mrs.  MINK  of  Hawaii.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise today  to  voice  my  strong  opposition  to  H.R. 4049,  the Privacy Commission Act. H.R.  4049  will  establish  a  commission  to study  how  best  to  protect  individual  privacy.  In eighteen  months  this  commission  will  provide its  findings  to Congress and  the President. Congress  is  already  well  aware  of  the  ability of  public  and  private  institutions  to  gather  and share  data.  While  the  gathering  of  personal data  has  heralded  improvements  in  customer services  and  national  security  efforts,  it  threatens  to  undermine  an  individual\u2019s  ability  to  protect  their most  private medical  and  financial  information.  Internationally,  an  individual\u2019s  ability to  control  their most  private  information  is  considered a human  right. I  am  very  concerned  about  the  invasion  of our  private  rights  and  that  is  why  Congress should  act  now,  not  postpone  action  for  another  eighteen  months  when  the  commission\u2019s report  is  completed. There  is  legislation  before  this  body  that would  provide  adequate  protection  for  individual  privacy.  I  am  a  cosponsor  of  three  such bills:  H.R.  1941,  H.R.  2447,  and  H.R.  3320. These  three  bills  will  protect  personal  health information  by  limiting  use  and  disclosure  of such  information,  prohibit  employment  or health  insurance  discrimination  based  on  genetic  information,  and  amend  the  privacy  provisions  in  the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act  to  prohibit  financial  institutions  from  disclosing,  or making  use  of,  nonpublic  personal  credit  information. On May  1,  2000, President Clinton  announced  his  consumer  privacy  plan  which  he presented  to  Congress  stating  \u2018\u2018we  cannot allow  new  opportunities  to  erode  old  and  fundamental  rights.\u2019\u2019 These  bills  and  the  President\u2019s  plan  should be  considered  by  the  full House.  Individual  privacy  protection  greatly  concerns  individuals  in my  district.  They  deserve  to  have  this  issue debated  in  full  and  addressed  immediately. H.R.  4049  will  serve  only  to  delay  this  process,  and  in  the  end  inform  us  and  the  American  people  what  is  already  abundantly  apparent:  Congress  must  act  immediately  to  protect individual privacy. f RECOGNIZING  TAYLOR\u201495  EMMA  BEATRICE YEARS  YOUNG asacon  her  95th  birthday.

It would  continue  the  original  CR  until October 20. I  might  say  and  remind  my  colleagues  that  the  House  has  passed  all of  the  appropriations  bills  earlier  this year,  but  because  of  conference  meetings  that  needed  to  be  taken  care  of and meetings with the White House, we have not concluded that business. However,  I  am  also  happy  to  report that  there  is  considerable movement,  I believe,  in  the  other  body  that  we  will see today, and hopefully we will be able to  conclude  this  appropriations  business next week  in  the House and  in  the other body. So  I  merely  ask  the  support  of  the Members  to  conclude  this  CR  today  so we  can  pass  it  on  to  the  Senate  and then get about our business. Mr.  Speaker,  I  reserve  the  my time. Mr.  OBEY.  Mr.  self 131\u20442 minutes. Mr.  Speaker,  what  I  say  is  meant  in no way to criticize the gentleman  from Florida, because he has been one of the few realistic voices on the other side of the  aisle  trying  to  point  out  what  the realities are. But  the  fact  is,  this  is,  what,  the third  continuing  resolution  that  we have  had. The  budget  is  supposed  to  be done  on  October  1.  We  are  now  getting much closer to November 1 than we are to  October  1.  What  have  we  seen?  We have  seen  bill  after  bill  emerge  from conference which have wound up spending  much  more  money  than  is  in  the President\u2019s budget. Those  bills  have  virtually  no  relationship whatsoever to the budget resolution which was  laid  out  at  the  beginning  of  the  year.  Yet,  we  have  no  real progress  in  meeting  the  needs  that  we feel  on  this  side  of  the  aisle  with  respect  to  the most crucial  issue  remaining in the budget, which is education. We  also  have  seen,  although  one  of the  appropriation  bills  tries  to  provide a  fig  leaf  on  this  issue,  we  have  seen this  Congress  take  no  action  on  prescription drugs. We have seen this Congress  take  no  action  on  the  Patients\u2019 Bill  of  Rights.  Both  of  those  issues  are still  pending  in  one  form  or  another  in various  appropriation  bills.  Yet,  none of them have any real prospect of being dealt  with  by  this  Congress  before  we adjourn. Now  we  are  being  asked  to  support another  week\u2019s  extension  of  the  deadline  for  finishing  our  business.  Frankly,  I  have  about  had  it.  I  think  the White  House  has,  too.  I  do  not  expect to  stand  on  this  floor  and  support  any further continuing resolutions for more than  one  or  two  days  at  a  time.  I  do not  believe  it  makes  sense  for  us  to continue  to  drift  along  in  this  fashion. What  I  sense  is  happening  is  that there is apparently a slow but nonetheless stealthy plan to avoid our ever facing  the  hard  votes  on  education  or  on the  Patients\u2019  Bill  of  Rights  or  on meaningful  reform  of  Medicare  to  include  a  prescription  drug  benefit.  I  do traditionAmerican American and  every not  believe  that  this  Congress  should leave this city until we have dealt with all three. I  do  not  say  that  because  these  happen  to  just  be  pet  issues  of mine.  I  say that  because America  has  always  been, to  me,  defined  by  two  things.  We  have been  defined  by  our  passion  for  individual  liberty,  and  we  have  also  been defined  by  our  determination  to  see  to it  that  the  experiences  that we have  in this  country  are  shared  experiences, and  that  whether  we  are  in  good  times or in troubled times, we are all in it together. That  is  why  we  have  had  ally  such  strong  support  for  institutions  and  for  the  democratic  process  by  each  one of our citizens. Mr.  Speaker,  the  reason  that  education is important and the reason prescription  drugs  are  important  and  the reason  the  Patients\u2019  Bill  of  Rights  are important  is  because  without  actions like  that,  large  segments  of  our  population  feel  that  they have  been  and  are being left out of the blessings and benefits of this society. There is no society in the world more blessed  than  is  the  society  of  the United  States.  We  have  been  given more  riches,  more  natural  beauty, more  geographic  insulation  from  the trouble  spots  of  the  world  than  any other  Nation  in  the  history  of  the globe. Yet, in my view, this Congress is failing  to  live up  to  the  traditions of  some of  the  great  Congresses  in  the  past  in seeing to  it that we take these benefits and  make  certain  that  everyone  has  a decent share. The  problem  that  we  have,  and  it  is why I voted against the energy bill,  for instance,  is  because  that  bill  spent  a lot  of money,  but  it  spent  it  in  no  context.  There  are  no  rules  that  describe at  this point what will be  spent or how far we  can go  in  spending. But we wind up,  we  wind  up  still  refusing  to  act  on the  administration\u2019s  education  priorities. Now,  the  majority  party  has  decided that  in  two  areas  of  education,  they are  going  to  put  a  significant  amount of money. One is special education, and the other is Pell grants. I  applaud  those  two  actions.  I  am fully  willing  to  embrace  those  priorities.  I  just  wish  that  the  other  side would  be  willing  to  embrace  our  priorities. I  would  call  the  attention  of  Mr. Bush  to  the  actions  of  this  Congress. Mr.  Bush  in  debates  the  past  2  weeks has  talked  a  lot  about  education,  and he  has  talked  about  the  bipartisan leadership that he would like to extend to this place.  I think bipartisan  leadership  starts  by  having  effective  control of one\u2019s own party. It  seems  to  me  that  right  now  we could use some help from Mr. Bush, because  this  Congress,  while  it  is  providing  large  amounts  of  money  acrossthe-board  in many  areas,  is  continuing to  resist  the  necessary  actions  to  realb ly make progress in reducing class size, to really make progress in training our teachers,  to  really  make  progress  in providing  a  significant number  of  additional  after-school  centers  so  that  our young  children,  if  they  are  in  a  family where  they  have  two  parents  working outside  the  home,  so  they  have  someplace  to  go  after  2:30  or  3  in  the  afternoon where they can be under adult supervision  and  be  in  an  atmosphere where they can learn. 1045 All  of  these  things  ought  to  be  embraced  by  both  parties,  but  we  are  not seeing  them  embraced  by  the  majority party in this House. And  so  I  stand  here  this  morning frustrated  because  we  have  a  lot  of rhetoric that tries to place everyone on the  side  of  education,  but  this  Congress,  having  a  record,  under  the  majority  party\u2019s  leadership,  having  a record  the  last  6  years  of  trying  to  cut billions  of  dollars  out  of  previous years\u2019 expenditures for education. They are now building on that record by trying to block a further expansion of education  initiatives  that  reflect  needed national  priorities  which  the  administration  has  taken  as  its  own.  To  me, that  is  the  major  problem  with  this continuing resolution today. I  do  not  see  any  purpose  in  kicking the  can  further down  the  road on  these continuing  resolutions  if  we  are  not going  to  get  the  two  or  three  major things  that  we  need  to  get  out  of  this Congress in order to call this a successful  Congress;  one  being  education,  another  being  a  real,  rather  than  a  fictional,  attack  on  the  problems  of  our seniors  who  need  prescription  drugs, and  the  third  being  the  passage  of  a real  patients\u2019  bill  of  rights  rather  than the passage of a bill of goods that masquerades as a patients\u2019 bill of rights. So  I will  support  this  continuing  resolution,  but  I  do  not  expect  to  stand here  supporting  any  further  long-term continuing  resolutions  because,  at  this point, they do not seem to be doing any good  in  terms of moving  this place  forward  to  recognizing  our  health  care, our  Medicare  and  our  education  priorities  that,  above  all,  this  Congress ought to be addressing.

Mr.  Speaker,  $40 million  was  utilized to  lobby  for  this  law;  but  yet  in States like  Texas,  where  our  home  is  our  life and  our  land,  they  did  not  even  allow language that states who had their own provisions  on  homestead  could  opt  out States  rights.  That  is  not  even  in  the legislation.  So  if  your  parents  have lived  in  a  home  that  has  increased  in value,  but  they  have  fallen  upon  hard times  because  of  bad  health,  they  cannot  even  utilize  the  homestead  exemption  if,  in  fact,  it  is more  than  $100,000 under this bankruptcy bill. In  this  economy  we  know  that  has occurred  if  families  have  lived  in homes  for  over  40  years.  Our  divorcees that  need  child  support,  in  Chapter  13, the  child  support  payments  are  put  in along with  credit  cards.  Can  you  imagine  that? Who  is  going  to  be  able  to  be the winner, the child needing child support,  the  parent  who  cannot  get  a  lawyer,  or  the  credit  card  company  that says  you  better  pay  my  credit  card debt before you pay child support or alimony? In  Chapter  7,  for  example,  there  are no assets, and mostly you pay administrative costs. How will someone pay alimony  or  child  support  unless  it  is  isolated? Let  me  share  with  my  colleagues what  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. HYDE),  chairman  of  the  Committee  on the  Judiciary,  said,  \u2018\u2018to  say  that  substituting a reasonably necessary standard, providing some flexibility in determining  what  a  debtor  can  live  on,  because  what  this  bill  does,  it  tells  you while  you  are  in  bankruptcy,  you  have to be governed by the Internal Revenue Service  expenses.\u2019\u2019  Can  you  imagine that? b RECORD CONGRESSIONAL 1215 The chairman says, why are we using the  IRS  standards?  This  is  the  only place  in  town,  this  bankruptcy  bill, where the IRS is popular. When he got to the floor of the House and  he  was  arguing  about  this  bill,  in the  on  May  5, 1999,  the  gentleman  from  Illinois (Chairman  HYDE)  said,  \u2018\u2018Lastly,  let  me pay  my  respects  to  the  creditor  lobby. They are awesome.\u2019\u2019 I  only  ask  that we  respect  the American  people.  We  know  that  the  American  people  believe  in  responsibility. That  is  what  this  Nation  was  founded on.  We  work  every  day.  We  pay  our bills. We pay our mortgages. But  I  tell my  colleagues  if  one  had  a catastrophic  illness,  a  tragic  accident, which  some  of  my  constituents  have had,  devastating  car  accident,  one  cannot  work  and  one  falls  upon  hard times,  does  one  need  the  IRS  telling one  what  one  can  live  on?  Does  one need  one\u2019s  house  being  taken  away from one. Does one need the credit card people  telling  one  they  are  more  important than one? I am voting against this rule, against the  bill,  and  I  ask  my  colleagues  to stand up for the American people. SIMPSON).  SESSIONS)  Mr.  SESSIONS.  Mr.  Speaker,  may  I ask  how  much  time  is  remaining  on both sides, please. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. The  gentleman  from  Texas (Mr.  has  10  minutes  remaining.  The  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr. FROST) has 171\u20442 minutes remaining. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate  the  dialogue  from  the  gentlewoman  from  Texas  (Ms.  I  would  like  to,  once  again,  ask  the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr. GEKAS) to respond. Mr. Speaker,  I yield  2 minutes  to  the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr. JACKSON-LEE). GEKAS). thank JACKSON-LEE)  Mr.  GEKAS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  the gentleman for yielding to me. Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  peculiar  to  hear the argument against our provisions on homestead  exemption  and  the  modification  we  made  to  it.  If  we  do  nothing, if we pass no bankruptcy reform at all,  the  opponents  of  the  current  bankruptcy  reform  say  we  like  the  present system, well,  the  present  system  is  the one  against  which  the  President  has railed  as  being  one  where  the  rich  can go  to  these  homestead  exemption States  and  escape  their  obligations. He is opposed to that kind of an exemption for the rich. So  now  we  offer  a  compromise  which preserves  the  homestead  exemption status of the States that employ  it and then  put  into  place  a  reform  measure that  discourages  the  rich  from  shopping  to  go  to  a  homestead  just  for  the purpose of avoiding bankruptcy. But  now  we  hear  the  gentlewoman from  Texas  (Ms.  criticizing  the  homestead  exemption.  Does she  want  us  to  stay  where  we  are,  to benefit the rich, as the President of the United  States  has  said?  That  is  a  salient question. On the homestead exemption,  I think I  am  going  to  engage  in  a  colloquy later with  people who  are  interested  in the  specifics  of  that,  and  I  will  be  glad to  engage  in  that.  But  the  other  point that  the  gentlewoman  from  Texas  attempted  to  make  about  the  stand  up for  the  American  people,  that  is  what we did; 313 of us stood up for the American consumer, the people who suffer at the  hands  of  people  who  go  bankrupt and have  to pay higher  costs at  the  supermarket  and  interest  rates  and  the taxes and all of that. The  priorities  that  we  set  for  women and  children  are  very  important  and high  priorities.  The  gentlewoman  from Texas  would  say  that  she  is  not  satisfied  with  those  priorities.  She  wants what is the current law to prevail here. If  that  is  the case,  then  she  should  recognize  and we  should  be  truthful  about the  fact  that  the  current  law  gives  no priorities to that. Mr.  FROST.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  2 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Michigan (Mr. CONYERS). Mr.  CONYERS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the  gentleman  from  Texas  for  yielding time  to  me,  and  I  yield  to  the  gentlewoman  from  Texas  (Ms.  JACKSON-LEE). GEKAS)  Ms.  JACKSON-LEE.  Mr.  Speaker,  I will  not  take  all  of  the  gentleman\u2019s time. I thank the ranking member very much,  and  I  thank  him  for  working  on this issue. Let  me  just  say  to  the  gentleman from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.  I  appreciate his work on this bill. But he is inaccurate. What happens  in  the discharge of alimony  and  child  support?  They  are lumped  in with  credit  card  debt.  It  is  a big  lump  of  prioritization.  What  those of  us  who  oppose  this  bill  are  asking for is to put credit card debt below that of  alimony  and  child  support,  which represents  real  life  or  death  issues  in the lives of children and families. All  this  bill  does  is  give  the  single parent, man or woman, with limited resources  an  opportunity  to  fight  to  get child  support  and  alimony.  We  know who  is  going  to  be  the  victor  in  that fight  against  the  big  credit  card  companies. The other  thing  is,  just on  the homestead  issue,  let  me  be  very  clear,  the language  in  the  conference  report  does not  have  the  opt-out  language  that protects  State  rights  to  allow  them  to opt  out  if  they  have  other  homestead exemptions. That is hurting senior citizens  who  have  lived  in  their  home  for 50  years  and  the  value  of  their  homes are  assessed  at  more  than  $100,000  because  the  value  has  increased.  That  is what  I  am  crying  out  against.  This  is not  reform.  This  bill  is  punitive  to many Americans. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker,  as more and  more  Members  begin  to  examine this,  I  think  the  awesome  power  of  the credit  lobby  is  becoming  very,  very clear. We are making a bill that makes bankruptcy worse. So  for the chairman of  the  subcommittee  to  be  telling  us that,  because  we  oppose  this  bill,  we want  to  go  back  to  the  existing  circumstance  is  inaccurate  at  least  for my  part.  What  we  want  is  a  better  set of  provisions  than  the  ones  that  exist now,  and  this  bill  does  not  contain them. Mr.  SESSIONS.  Mr.  Speaker,  the gentleman  from Texas  (Mr. FROST), my colleague  on  the  Committee  on  Rules, indicates  he  does  not  have  further speakers.  I  have  indicated  back  that  I do  have  two  additional  speakers.  I  am well  aware  there  is  an  imbalance  on time  on  both  sides.  I  will  proceed  with that understanding.  I will proceed with two  additional  speakers,  then  I  will offer  the  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr. the  opportunity  to  close,  and then I will do the same. Mr. Speaker,  I yield  4 minutes  to  the gentleman  from  Del  Mar,  California FROST)  (Mr. CUNNINGHAM). Mr.  CUNNINGHAM.  Mr.  Speaker,  I was  not  even  going  to  speak  on  this issue  until  I  heard  the  Democrat  leadership\u2019s  partisan  attacks  which  has flowed  through  these  Chambers  over the last year.

And  then,  80  percent  of  all the  banks  would  be  exempted  from even that requirement. Mr.  Speaker,  this  is  a  mean-spirited bill.  This  is  a  measure  that  does  not meet the tests of anybody. Finally, I would like to just reiterate the  comment  made  by  my  good  friend, the  member  of  the  Committee  on  the Judiciary, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BOUCHER), about moving child support  from  the  seventh  to  the  first  priority.  That  is  meaningless.  It  does  it, but the order of priorities apply only in Chapter  7  among  unsecured  creditors during the bankruptcy proceeding. Ninety-six  percent  of  all  the  consumer  debtors  do  not  have  any  assets to  distribute  to  prior  unsecured  creditors, so that has no meaning. It  is a  fig leaf.  It  is  phony.  It  does  not  improve child  support,  for  those  who  need  the child  support  at  all,  because  it  moves the credit card debtors to the same priority  as  those  who  need  child  support. Sorry  to  have  to  tell  everyone  about this  at  the  end  of  this  discussion,  but  I am  afraid  that  those  are  the  sad  and sorry  consequences  of  a  bill  that  has the  earmarks  of  the  creditor  lobby, that  awesome  creditor  lobby  that  has had  such  an  undue  influence  on  the measure before us. Mr.  Speaker,  I  have  quests  for  time,  and  I  balance of my time. Mr. GEKAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  I  do  this  for  one  small purpose,  to  reiterate  for  the  record,  for the  Members  of  the  House,  that  every contention  made  by  the  gentleman from  Michigan  (Mr.  every action  taken  by  those  who  oppose bankruptcy  reform,  every  debate  that they  offered  over  the  course,  every  one of them has been thoroughly discussed, thoroughly  debated,  and  each  one  of them  considered  in  the  overwhelming vote granted bankruptcy reform by the Members of the House.

First,  this  Member  would  thank  the  distinguished  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr. GEKAS),  Chairman  of  the  Judiciary  Subcommittee  on  Commercial  and  Administrative Law,  for  introducing  the House bankruptcy  legislation  (H.R.  833).  This  Member  would  also like  to  express  his  appreciation  to  the  distinno  further  yield  back  CONYERS),  rethe guished  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  HYDE), the  Chairman  of  the  Judiciary  Committee,  for his  efforts  in  getting  this  measure  to  the House Floor  for  consideration. This  Member  supports  the  Bankruptcy  Reform  Act  for  numerous  reasons;  however,  the most  important  reasons  include  the  following: First,  and  of  preeminent  importance  to  the nation\u2019s  agriculture  sector,  this  Member  supports  the  provision  in  H.R.  2415  which  permanently  extends  Chapter  12  of  the  Bankruptcy Code  for  family  farmers.  Chapter  12  bankruptcy allows  family  farmers  to  reorganize  their debts  as  compared  to  liquidating  their  assets. Chapter  12  bankruptcy  has  been  a  viable  option  for  family  farmers  nationwide.  It  has  allowed  family  farmers  to  reorganize  their assets in  a  manner  which  balances  the  interests  of creditors  and  the  future  success  of  the  involved  farmer. If  Chapter  12  bankruptcy  provisions  are  not permanently  extended  for  family  farmers,  this will  have  a  drastic  impact  on  an  agricultural sector  already  reeling  from  low  commodity prices.  Not  only  will  many  family  farmers  have to  end  their  operations,  but  also  land  values will  likely  plunge  downward.  Such  a  decrease in  land  values  will  affect  both  the  ability  of family  farmers  to  earn  a  living  and  the manner in which banks, making agricultural  loans,  conduct  their  lending  activities.  This  Member  has received  many  contacts  from  his  constituents regarding  the  extension  of  Chapter  12  bankruptcy  because  of  the  situation  now  being faced  by  our  nation\u2019s  farm  families\u2014although the  U.S.  economy  is  generally  healthy,  it  is clear  the agricultural  sector  is hurting. Second,  this  Member  supports  the  provision in  H.R.  2415  which  provides  for  a  means  testing  (needs-based)  formula  when  determining whether  an  individual  should  file  for  Chapter  7 or  Chapter  13  bankruptcy.  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  allows  a  debtor  to  be  discharged  of  his or  her  personal  liability  for  many  unsecured debts.  In  addition,  there  is  no  requirement  that a  Chapter  7  filer  repay  many  of  his  or  her debts.  However,  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  filers, on  the  other  hand,  commit  to  repay  some  portion  of  his  or  her  debts  under  a  repayment plan. Some  Chapter  7  filers  actually  have  the  capacity  to  repay  some  of  what  they  owe,  but they  choose  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  and  are able  to  walk  away  from  these  debts.  For  example,  the  stories  in  which  an  individual  filed for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  and  then  goes  out takes  a  nice  vacation  and/or  buys  a  new  car are  too  common.  Moreover,  the  status  quo  is costing  the  average  American  individual  and family  in  increased  costs  for  consumer  goods and  credit  because  of  the  amount  of  debt which  is never  repaid  to  creditors. As  a  response  to  these  concerns,  the needs-based  test  of  H.R.  2415  will  help  ensure  that  high  income  filers,  who  could  repay some  of  what  they  owe,  are  required  to  file Chapter  13  bankruptcy  as  compared  to  Chapter  7.  This  needs-based  system  takes  a  debtor\u2019s  income,  expenses,  obligations  and  any special  circumstances  into  account  when  determining  whether  he  or  she  has  the  capacity to  repay a portion of  their debts. Third,  this  Member  supports  the  additional monthly  expenses  that  are  not  considered  as a  factor  under  the  needs-based  test  of  H.R. 2415  which  determines  whether  a  person  can file  Chapter  7  or  13  bankruptcy.  These  expenses  include  the  following:  reasonable  expenses  incurred  to  maintain  the  safety  of  the debtor  and  debtor\u2019s  family  from  domestic  violence,  an  additional  food  and  clothing  allowance  if  demonstrated  to  be  reasonable  and necessary;  and  reasonable  and  necessary  expenses  for  the  care  and  support  of  an  elderly, chronically  ill,  or  disabled  member  of  the  debtor\u2019s household or  immediate  family. In  closing,  for  these aforementioned  reasons and  others,  this  Member  would  encourage  his colleagues  to  support  the Conference  report  of H.R. 2415. Ms.  DELAURO.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  regret  I  was absent  from  the  floor  of  the  House  on  October 12. Had  I been present,  I would have  voted  for the  motion  to  instruct  conferees  to  have  an open  conference on bankruptcy  reform. I  look  forward  to  this  conference.  An  issue as  crucial  as  this  deserves  a  full  and  fair  debate.  Bankruptcy  reform  should  expect  responsible  efforts  from  both  debtors  and  creditors  that  extend  credit  far  beyond  what  individuals are  capable of paying back. Mr.  CONYERS.  Mr.  Speaker,  the  following is  a  letter  which  clarifies  what  will  happen  to child  support  obligations  if  this  bill  passes.  It answers  the  myth  that  this  bill  will  not  harm children. NATIONAL WOMEN\u2019S LAW CENTER, Washington, DC, June 7, 2000. Hon. ROBERT Cannon House Office Building, Washington, DC. MENENDEZ, DEAR MENENDEZ:  REPRESENTATIVE The  undersigned  organizations  are  long-time  advocates  for women and  children,  including  economically  vulnerable  single  parents  and their  families. We  are writing  in  response  to your  May  24  letter  to  your  colleagues  which criticizes  the  recent  TIME  magazine  article on  bankruptcy  and  asserts  that  the  pending bankruptcy  bill  would  help  children  obtain child  support. We must  respectfully,  but  emphatically,  disagree.  The  bill  would  give many creditors, including credit card companies,  finance  companies,  auto  lenders  and others,  greater  claims  to  a  debtor\u2019s  limited resources  than  they  have  under  current  law. This  would  intensify  the  competition  for scarce resources between children owed child support  and  sophisticated  commercial  creditors both during and after bankruptcy. Your  letter  characterizes  as  a  \u2018\u2018myth\u2019\u2019  the statement  in  the  TIME  Magazine  article that: \u2018\u2018The proposed legislation would treat a bankrupt man\u2019s  credit  card debt  the  same as his  obligation  to  pay  child  support.\u2019\u2019  However,  the  effect  of  several  provisions  of  the bill,  taken  together,  would  indeed  have  this result. As  the National Association of Attorneys General,  commenting  on  a  similar,  earlier  version  of  the  bankruptcy  bill  warned, it: Would  encourage  credit  card  companies  to treat all debts as secured even though the resale  value  of  the  personal  property  charged on  such  cards  would  rarely  approach  the amount  of  the  debt  and  even  though  the  interest  rates  charged  for  such  debt  are  set  in recognition  of  the  fact  that  such  debts  are essentially unsecured; and As  a  consequence,  could  allow  credit  card debt  to  be  elevated  to  the  same  or  a  higher level  than  domestic  support  claims  and make  it  far  more  difficult  to  ensure  that debtors  will  be  able  to  satisfy  their  obligations  to  their  spouses  and  children.  (Emphasis  added)  (Resolution  of  the  National  Association of Attorneys General, March, 1999) Your letter states the following \u2018\u2018fact\u2019\u2019: Bankruptcy  reform moves  child  support  to the  number  one  priority  position  in  bankruptcy  proceedings.

Mr.  Speaker, this  should  be  a  guy  thing,  and  I  want to  tell my  colleagues  why.  I  joined  the Labor-HHS  committee  because  it  focuses  primarily  on  two  issues:  one  is education,  the  other  is  medical  research.  This  century  is  going  to  be,  I think,  not  for  technology  but  the most important century for medical research in the history of mankind, from the genome  program  to  cell  division  where we  can  take pancreatic  cells and  inject into maybe a child that has juvenile diabetes. I would like my colleagues to remember  that  we  lost  Herb  Bateman  this year.  Congressman  Vento,  we  go  to  his funeral  tomorrow.  Cancer  is  a  brutal thing.  I  know  many  of  our  colleagues on  this  floor  have  contracted  it.  I  have talked  to  the  gentlewoman  from  Connecticut  (Ms.  DELAURO).  She  is  a  cancer  survivor.  My  mom  is  a  cancer  survivor. There is no better woman in this country  than  my  little  mom.  But  can you  imagine, and I know when the doctor  looked  me  in  the  face  and  said, \u2018\u2018Duke,  you\u2019ve  got  cancer,\u2019\u2019  that  is pretty  tough. And  I  try  and  put myself in  the  position  that  what  if  I  did  not have  care  for  my  medical  retirement from  my  military  retirement,  what  if someone  says,  \u2018\u2018Duke,  you\u2019ve  got  prostate  cancer,  but  you\u2019ve  got  no  hope. You\u2019re  going  to  die.\u2019\u2019  How  terrible  is that  in  a  country  as  powerful  as  ours? I look at the things in my own personal life.  I  am  pro-life.  My  colleagues  know that.  And  I  disagree  with  areas  like Planned  Parenthood  on  their  abortion issue.  But  I  went  to  Planned  Parenthood,  and  I  saw  many  women  receive mammograms,  pap  smears,  care  that indigent  women  would  not  have  received.  At  least  we  need  to  come  together in those areas to make sure that many  of  our  unfortunate  that  do  not have  health  care  can  come  together and  get  that.  That  is  why  I  think  this is  so  important,  and  I  rise  in  strong support. I want to thank my colleagues on both  sides of  the aisle  for  this  legislation. Ms.  yield  from  SLAUGHTER.

Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  to  support this measure  and  to  pay  tribute  to  the gentlewoman  from  California  (Ms. and  the  gentlewoman  from North  Carolina  (Mrs.  for  taking  the  lead  and  for  the  rest  of  the women  in  the  bipartisan Women\u2019s Caucus. Many  taxpayers\u2019  dollars went  into the  discovery  and  the  security  of  having  diagnostic  and  treatment  modalities  for  cervical  and  breast  cancer. Yet we  have  seen  a  number  of  working women,  low-income  women  without health  insurance  coverage  not  be  able to  get  treatment  simply  because  they cannot  afford  it.  Yet  some  of  their  tax dollars  went  into  the  real  arrival  of these answers that we have today. I  stand  here  as  a  cancer  survivor  because  of  these  diagnostic  and  treatment modalities. b COBURN)  1500 My  grandmother  was  a  victim.  So  I do  know  what  it  is  like  to  be  told  not only  of  a  family  member  but  be  told myself  that  I  have  cancer,  and  to  have access to getting treatment. I  would  hope  that  the  gentleman from  Oklahoma  (Mr.  would understand  that  we  do  not  want  to delay  this measure  any  longer  in  going to get the President\u2019s signature so that women  can  have  access  to  this  treatment.  I  do  not  believe  that  he  would want to do that. I  understand  the  seriousness  of  that virus.  I  too  am  a  health  professional.  I am  a  registered  nurse  and  understand the  real  importance  of  early  diagnosis and  treatment.  Far  too  long  we  have waited  for  this  to  become  law,  and  I hope we will wait no longer. Mrs. MYRICK. Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  2 minutes  to  the  gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN). Ms.  ROS-LEHTINEN.  Mr.  Speaker,  I thank  my  good  friend,  the  gentlewoman  from  North  Carolina  (Mrs. MYRICK), for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, breast and cervical cancers  have  continued  to  increase  in  exponential numbers. Just today approximately  480  women  across  our  Nation will  be  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer and  approximately  120  will  die  from this  affliction.  Women\u2019s  cancers  are sweeping  the  families  of  our  Nation  at high  speeds, and while  researchers continue  to  look  for  cures  and  effective treatments, many women will  never  be able  to  see  the  benefits  of  such  research  because  they  simply  will  not  be able to afford it. Today, by passing this legislation, we will  be  on  our  way  to  ensuring  that low-income  women  without  health  insurance have access to lifesaving treatment. Cancer  eats  away  at  the  spirits  of women  battling  with  this  disease. These women  should  not  have  to waste their  energy  scrambling  for  an  ad  hoc patchwork  of  providers,  volunteers  and charity  care  programs  that  will  only result  in  unpredictable,  delayed,  or  incomplete  treatment.  For  the  women and  families  fighting  cancer,  every minute  counts.  They  simply  cannot and should not have to wait any  longer for  this  treatment. Their  lives may  depend  on  the  outcome  of  today\u2019s  vote.  I urge my colleagues  to vote  for  the passage  of  this  bill  so  that  low-income women  can  have  a  fighting  chance  at beating breast or cervical cancer. I  would  like  to  thank  my  dear  constituent,  Jane  Torres,  president  of  the Florida  Breast  Cancer  Coalition,  for her  selfless  devotion  to  this  very  worthy cause; and to Fran Visco, president of  the  National  Breast  Cancer  Coalition,  for  her  tireless  efforts  to  eradicate breast cancer; and  to my dear colleague,  the  gentleman  from  New  York (Mr.  LAZIO),  the  leader  of  this  legislation,  who  continues  to  show  through his  actions  that  the  welfare  and  the health  of  women  and  families  remain his  priorities;  and  lastly,  to  my  colSLAUGHTER)  league,  the  gentlewoman  from  North Carolina (Mrs. MYRICK), a breast cancer survivor  and  a  fighter  to  whom  this legislation  is  dedicated  and  a  fearless advocate  for  all  women  living  with breast cancer. Ms.  SLAUGHTER.  Mr.  Speaker,  I yield  2  minutes  to  the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. MALONEY). Mrs.  MALONEY  of  New  York.  Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the  gentlewoman from  New  York  (Ms.  for yielding me this time, and for her leadership. Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong  support of  this  rule  and  the  underlying  bill. This  is  an  extremely  important  bill, and  it  will  literally  save  thousands  of women\u2019s  lives.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask  everyone  to  stop  for a moment and  think about what  they might  do  if  they were diagnosed  with  cancer  but  were  told that  no  treatment  options  were  available  under  their  insurance  and  that they  could  not  afford  treatment  because  they  could  barely  afford  to  feed their family and pay their rent. Mr. Speaker,  for  thousands of women in  this  country,  this  is  an  unfortunate reality.  There  is  an  outstanding  program  under  the  CDC  called  the  National  Breast  and  Cervical  Cancer Early  Detection  program.  It  provides screening  for  low-income  women  who have  little  or  no  health  insurance,  but for  women  who  find  that  they  have cancer  from  this  important  screening program  there  is  no  guarantee  of  any treatment.  It  is  clear  that  this  situation  must  change.  This  bill  will  do that. The  Women\u2019s  Caucus  has  made  top  priority.  I  want  to  thank  the  tlewoman  from  California  (Ms.  and  the  gentlewoman  from  California (Mrs.  CAPPS),  the  gentlewoman  from North Carolina  (Mrs. MYRICK),  the gentlewoman  from Missouri  (Ms. DANNER), and  my  Women\u2019s  Caucus  cochair,  the gentlewoman  from  New  York  (Mrs. KELLY),  for  their  tireless  work  to  get this  bill  passed.  I  also  want  to  thank all  the  members  of  the  Women\u2019s  Caucus  who  signed  a  letter  to  Speaker this  week  urging  swift  passage of the bill. This  bill  gives  States  the  option  to provide  Medicaid  coverage  to  uninsured or underinsured women who have been  diagnosed  through  the  CDC\u2019s screening  program.  It  passed  overwhelmingly  in  the  House  and  Senate, and  every  day  this  bill  is  delayed  we have  women  dying  from  treatable breast  and  cervical  cancer.  Today  is  a great  and  important  day  for  women facing  breast  and  cervical  cancer.  I commend  the  leadership  for bringing  it to  the  floor  today,  and  I  also  want  to commend  the  gentleman  from  Oklahoma  (Mr.  for  his  efforts  and pledge my support to continue working with him on the dangers of HPV.

            "38": "H9854 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:69) October 12, 2000 testament  to  the  sound  judgment  and hard work  of  the  committee  leadership and, indeed, of all my colleagues on the committee. During  our  meetings  with  the  Senate,  and  our  discussions  with  the  administration,  concern  arose  over  a House  proposal  to  require  the National Reconnaissance  Office  to  contract  separately  from  the  Air  Force  for  the large  rockets  that  carry our  reconnaissance satellites into orbit. The  House  Permanent  Select  Committee  on  Intelligence  adopted  this proposal  after  substantial  investigations  and  hearings  following  the  disturbing  and  costly  string  of  launch failures  and  after  several  years  of  unjustified volatility in the NRO\u2019s launch budget. The  Subcommittee  on  Tactical  and Technical  Intelligence,  on  which  I serve  as  ranking  member,  concluded that  there  would  be  greater  accountability  and  sounder  fiscal management if  the  NRO  were  assigned  clearer  responsibility  for  this  aspect  of  its  overall mission. At  the  same  time,  I  appreciate  the concerns  that  this  step  could  contribute  to  deterioration  of  the  partnership  between  the  Air  Force  and  the NRO  in  managing  U.S.  national  security space launch programs. In  this  regard,  I  would  cite  the  clear guidance  in  the  statement  of managers that  we  expect  the  NRO  and  the  Air Force  to  continue  working  closely  together, including negotiating contracts with industry together to ensure favorable prices. I  would  add  also  that  I  expect  the NRO\u2019s  contract  awards  to  provide  appropriate  support  to  DoD\u2019s  policy  of maintaining  a  competitive  space launch  industrial  base.  The  NRO  and the  Air  Force  are  of  course  subject  to higher management  authority,  and  the NRO director himself an Assistant Secretary  of  the Air Force.  I would  expect that DoD management could check any harmful  centrifugal  forces  in  the  NROAir Force relationship. Mr.  Speaker,  I  will  conclude  by  applauding  the  vigorous  steps  contained in  the  conference  report  to  overcome serious management and resource problems  at  the  National  Security  Agency and  to  improve  the  ability  of  the  National  Imagery and Mapping Agency  to exploit  and  distribute  imagery  collected  by  satellites  and  aircraft.  These agencies  and  their  respective  missions remain  absolutely  critical  to  diplomacy and military preparedness. I  think  it  is  a  great  conference  report.  I  think  we  are  moving  forward.  I urge  my  colleagues  and  the  House  to adopt  it.  I  think  the  committee  has done  a  good  job,  and  we  have  served our colleagues and the country well. Mr. DIXON. Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume. Let  me  begin  by  complimenting  the gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr.  GOSS), our  chairman,  for  his  hard  work  and his  dedication,  as  reflected  in  this  conference  report,  to meeting  the  needs  of the  men  and  women  who  produce  the intelligence  on  which  policy  makers and military commanders rely. As  adopted  by  the  House,  the  intelligence  authorization  was  one-tenth  of one  percent  above  the  President\u2019s  request.  This  conference  report  is  below the  House  bill  and  two-tenths  of  one percent below the request. The primary reason for the reduction is that some of the  items  authorized  in  the  House  bill were  funded  several  months  ago  in  a supplemental appropriations measure. The conference report, as did the supplemental  appropriation  bill,  supports the  transformation  initiative  that  the Director  of  the  National  Security Agency,  General  Michael  Hayden,  has begun  to  implement.  It  is  critical  to the  security  of  the  United  States  that NSA be modernized. General Hayden has developed a plan, which  the  committee  generally  supports.  The  modernization  of  NSA  will not  succeed,  however,  without  the  sustained, visible  support of  the most  senior  leaders  of  the  Department  of  Defense  and  the  intelligence  community. To  date,  in  terms  of  resource  allocation,  I  have  not  seen  evidence  that  the rebuilding  of  NSA  is  a  top  priority  of the  executive  branch.  I  hope  that  this changes next year. One  of  the  shortcomings  in  the  intelligence community, in my view, is that there  is  too  much  emphasis  on  collection  and  not  enough  on  making  sure that  which  is  collected  can  be  used.  If it  were  possible  to  collect  only  important information, this imbalance would be inconsequential. Our  national  technical  means,  however,  collect  volumes  of  information that must be analyzed to  identify what is  important,  put  in  a usable  form,  and sent to those who need it. Last  year,  Congress  made  clear  its expectation  that  the  new  Future  Imagery  Architecture  (FIA)  would  be  an adequate  balance  between  collection activities  and  TPED  or  tasking,  processing,  exploitation  and  dissemination activities. Congress was clear in the description  of  the  consequences  that would  flow  from  an  executive  branch decision  not  to  make  TPED  investments  sufficient  to  utilize  fully  the collection  capabilities  of  FIA.  As  the classified  annex  to  this  conference  report  makes  clear,  the  resolve  of  Congress on this issue has not changed. The  conference  agreement  amends the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance Act  (FISA)  and  the  criminal  code  in ways that deserve some comment. 1600 Among  other  things,  the  FISA amendments  make  clear  that,  in  making  a  probable  cause  determination that  a  target was  an  agent  of  a  foreign power,  the  court may  consider  past  activities of the target. I am advised that the  target\u2019s  past  activities  have  regularly  been  part  of  a  probable  cause  determination.  In  this  respect,  the amendment represents a codification of current practice. b There have been  suggestions  that the amendment is needed to ensure that information once excluded from the probable  cause  determination  merely  because  it  was  dated  will  now  be  considered.  I  believe  that  this  is  an  incorrect interpretation  of  both  the  current practice  and  the  effect  of  the  amendment.  Those  facts  which  are  relevant to  determining  the  probability  that  a target  is  currently  an  agent  of  a  foreign power  should be considered. Those facts  that  are  irrelevant,  regardless  of whether  they  are  fresh  or  stale,  should not be considered. Section  304  makes  the  unauthorized disclosure  of  properly  classified  information  acquired  by  a  person  who  has, or  had,  authorized  access  to  the  information  a  felony,  subject  to  3  years  imprisonment,  when  the  disclosure  is made willingly and knowingly to a person  known  not  to  have  authorized  access.  I  disapprove  of  the  practice  by which  some  individuals  entrusted  with access  to  classified  information  leak that  information  to  unauthorized  recipients,  including  members  of  the media.  I  share  the  frustration  of  those who  open  their  daily  newspapers  only to  see  in  print  some  of  the  most  sensitive  information  in  our  government\u2019s possession.  I  have,  however,  grave  concerns  about  the  reach  and  the  scope  of section 304. There are currently a variety of statutory  and  administrative  prohibitions on  the  authorized  disclosure  of  classified  information.  The  fact  that  more leakers  are  not  punished  is  not,  and  I stress  is  not,  the  result  of  too  few  prohibitions,  it  is  the  result  of  the  great difficulty  inherent  in  identifying  the leakers.  Section  304  adds  another  prohibition,  unwisely  in  my  judgment.  It will  not  make  it  easier  to  identify  the source of a leak. Before our conference began, the gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr.  GOSS)  and  I received  a  letter  from  the  chairman and  ranking member  of  the Committee on  the  Judiciary  urging  the  rejection of  this  provision.  In  their  letter  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HYDE) and the  gentleman  from  Michigan  (Mr. noted  that  by  making  all leaks  subject  to  criminal  penalties  the provision  \u2018\u2018has  profound  First  Amendment implications and goes to the very heart  of  the  ability  of  the  public  to  remain  informed  about  matters  of  critical  public  interest  which  often  relate to governmental misdeeds.\u2019\u2019 In  conference,  I  offered  an  amendment to narrow the definition of classified  information  under  section  304  to make  sure  that  only  leaks  of  information of substantial sensitivity would be punished  under  this  provision.  Other leaks  would  continue  to  be  punishable under  other  statutes  or  administrative procedures.  Although  my  amendment was  approved  by  the  House  conferees, the  Senate  rejected  it.  I  hope  that  in the  next  Congress  the  Committee  on the Judiciary, in whose jurisdiction the issues raised by section 304 properly reside,  will  carefully  examine  the  provision.

Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  business  in  order under  the  Calendar  Wednesday  rule  be dispensed with on Wednesday next. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Is  there objection  to  the  request  of  the  gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. f have  sevthe  genOn  Wednesday,  October  18,  and  the balance of the week the House will consider the following measures: H.R. 4635, the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs and  Housing  and  Urban  Development Appropriations  Act  conference  report; H.R.  4577,  the  Departments  of  Labor, Health  and  Human  Services,  and  Education  appropriations  conference  report;  and  H.R.  4942,  the  District  of  Columbia  appropriations  conference  report. Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider any other conference reports that may  become  available  throughout  the week. Mr. FROST. Mr.  Speaker,  I  eral  questions,  if  I  may,  to  tleman from Florida. The  first  question  is,  does  the  gentleman  expect  any  other  business  on Tuesday besides suspension bills? Mr. GOSS.  If  the gentleman will continue  to  yield,  Mr.  Speaker,  on  Tuesday  there  is  possibly  a motion  to  go  to conference on the VA\u2013HUD bill. That is a possibility. Mr.  FROST.  Another  question.  The gentleman  has  said  on  Wednesday  and the  balance  of  the  week,  and  the  gentleman  listed  several  bills.  Could  the gentleman  be  more  specific  as  to  what day  the  gentleman  expects  the  LaborHHS  appropriations  to  be  on  the  floor? Mr. GOSS. It is clear that we can say the  conferees  are  working  hard.  We hope  to  know  sooner  rather  than  later exactly  which  bills  are  going  to  come up  on  which  days,  but  I  do  not  think  I can give any specific certainty on that. I  would  not  want  to  preclude  the  hard work that is going on. Mr.  FROST.  The  final  question, which is, of course, the $64,000 question, on  which  day  does  the  gentleman  expect us to adjourn for the year? Mr. GOSS.  If  the gentleman will continue  to  yield,  I  think  the  gentleman undervalues the question. Mr. FROST. A little inflation. Mr. GOSS. I am sorry to say that I do not have the answer to that question. Mr.  FROST.  I  thank  the  gentleman very much. f ADJOURNMENT  TO  MONDAY, OCTOBER  16,  2000 Mr.  GOSS. Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  when  the  House  adjourns  today,  it  adjourn  to  meet  at  2 p.m. on Monday next. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Is  there objection  to  the  request  of  the  gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. f HOUR  OF  MEETING  ON  TUESDAY, OCTOBER  17,  2000 Mr.  GOSS. Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask  unanimous consent when  the House adjourns on Monday, October  16,  2000,  it  adjourn to meet at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, October 17, for morning hour debates. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Is  there objection  to  the  request  of  the  gentleman from Florida? I and  in the city of South Euclid on behalf of the mayor, Arnold C. D\u2019Amico. Mr.  Speaker,  Arnold  D\u2019Amico  was  born  in Warren,  Ohio  on  September  3,  1923  and  received  his  early  education  from  Notre  Dame Sisters  at  Saint  Mary\u2019s  Catholic  School.  After graduating  from  Warren  Harding  School  he enrolled  at  Kent  State  University.  However, World  War  II  interrupted  his  college  education and  Mr.  D\u2019Amico  served  with  distinction  for three  years  in  the  United  States  Army,  and was  assigned  to  the  Aleutian  Islands  and  the China-Burma-India  theaters.  Following  his  distinguished  military  service  he  returned  to  Kent State  University,  earning  a  Bachelor  of Science degree  in business Administration. After  graduation,  Mr.  D\u2019Amico  was  very  active  politically  in  the  Greater  Cleveland  business  community  with  a  career  spanning  over 20  years.  During  this  time  he  was  elected councilman  for  Ward  2  in  South  Euclid,  Ohio. While  on  City  Council,  Mr.  D\u2019Amico  served  on the  Planning  Commission,  and  he  was  the chairman  of  the  Council  of  Government  of  the Tri-City  Consortium  on  Aging  Commission. Subsequently,  he  was  elected  Mayor  of  South Euclid, Ohio. In  1976,  Arnold  D\u2019Amico  became  South  Euclid\u2019s  first  full  time  Mayor.  He  was  not  only committed  to  the  city  of  South  Euclid,  but  he was  also  instrumental  in  moving  the  city  forward.  Under  his  leadership  South  Euclid  prospered  and  established  itself  as  a  model  city  of efficiency. Mayor  D\u2019Amico  was  a  wonderful  man  am happy  to  support  this designation. Mr.  MCHUGH.  Mr.  Speaker,  if  the gentleman  from  Oregon  will  continue to  yield,  I  want  to  thank  the  gentlewoman from Ohio for bringing this designation to our attention. We  have  had  the  opportunity  on  this House floor to name facilities on behalf of  many  distinguished  Americans,  and clearly,  this  particular  individual meets that high standard. I  think  it  is  important  to  note  that Mr. D\u2019Amico spent a lifetime in service to his community, a  lifetime  in  service to his country, beginning  in his service in  World  War  II  in  the  United  States Army,  moving  on  as  a  diligent  worker in the Office of Price Stabilization, and later as an auditor for the Air Force. But  clearly  through  all  of  his  years, he  most  distinguished  himself  during his  distinguished  service  in  the  South Euclid  City  Council,  and  as  I  am  told, later  became  not  just  the  mayor  of South  Euclid  in  1972,  but  indeed,  the first full full-time mayor in 1976. Reading  the  materials  presented  by the  gentlewoman  on  his  behalf,  I  can say  without  fear  of  qualification  that he  accomplished  much  during  his  tenure  there.  He  established  an  office  on the aging, a paramedic program, established  the  911  emergency  program,  and pushed  for  a  community  center.  He later  served  as  president  of  the  county Mayors\u2019  Association,  chairman  and treasurer  of  the  regional  income  tax authority, and so much more. Clearly, Mr. Speaker, we have  in  this individual someone who understood the sense  and  the  value  of  community,  and did  not  just  recognize  it  in  his  own heart  but went  out  and  gave  of himself to contribute back. to  the Mr.  to  the will  the Speaker,  ARNOLD  C.  D\u2019AMICO  STATION Mr.  MCHUGH.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask unanimous  consent  that  the  Committee  on  Government  Reform  be  discharged  from  further  consideration  of the  bill  (H.R.  4853)  to  redesignate  the facility  of  the  United  States  Postal Service  located  at  1568  South  Glen Road  in  South  Euclid,  Ohio,  as  the \u2018\u2018Arnold  C.

Is  there objection  to  the  request  of  the  gentleman from New York? Mr.  BLUMENAUER.  Reserving  the right  to  object, Mr.  Speaker,  I will  not object,  and  I  rise  in  support  of  H.R. 4853. Mr.  MCHUGH.  gentleman yield? Mr.  BLUMENAUER.  I  yield  gentleman from New York. Mr.  MCHUGH.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. Mr.  Speaker,  I  will  try  to  be  very brief for an explanation to the House. The  bill  before  us  was  introduced  by our  colleague,  the  gentlewoman  from Ohio  (Mrs.  on  July  13  of  this year,  and  was  amended  by  the  Committee  on  Government  Reform  on  October 5. The  amendment  very  simply  changes the  word  \u2018\u2018Glen\u2019\u2019  to  \u2018\u2018Green\u2019\u2019,  as  determined  after  review  by  the  United States Postal Service. As the Clerk has read,  it  does  redesignate  the  facility  of the  United  States  Postal  Service  located  at  1568  South  Green  Road  in South  Euclid,  Ohio,  now  known  as  the South  Euclid  Station,  to  afterwards  be designated  as  the  Arnold  C.  D\u2019Amico station. As  is  the  practice  of  the  Committee on Government Reform,  the  entire  delegation in this House from the State of Ohio has cosponsored this legislation. Mrs.  JONES  of  Ohio.  Mr.  Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr.  BLUMENAUER.  I  gentlewoman from Ohio. (Mrs.  JONES  of  Ohio  asked  and  was given  permission  to  revise  and  extend her remarks.) Mrs.  JONES  of  Ohio.

There was something here that excited, I  think,  the  attention  of  environmentalists,  conservationists,  and  citizens all across the country. According  to  the  San  Antonio  Express  News  last  year,  when  asked  if  he would  support  the  legislation,  the  governor  did  not  know.  I  quote:  \u2018\u2018I  do  not know  how  to  answer  your  question.\u2019\u2019 And  to  the  best  of  my  knowledge,  I have  not  seen  him  adding  his  voice  to try  and  pry  this  legislation  out  of  the death  grip  that  it  has  with  the  Senate leadership  where  it  has  not  been  permitted to move. It  is  clear  that  Governor  Bush  would increase  logging  on  public  lands,  but  it is  less  clear  what  that  environmental impact  would  be.  He  would  reverse  the roadless  area  protections  that  are  encountered  in  the  administration\u2019s roadless areas initiative, and this came out  of his  visit  to Seattle,  as  quoted  in the  Seattle  Post-Intelligencer  on  June 26 of this year. The  vice  presidential  nominee  of  the Republican Party has been clear that a Bush-Cheney  administration  would  be very  interested  in  reopening  the  issue of  the  lands  that  have  been  protected from  development  by  this  administration. Another  issue  of  great  concern  to those  of  us  in  the  Pacific  Northwest, where  we  are  struggling  with  how  to balance the variety of interests dealing with  the  problems  of  the  Columbia River  System,  with  the  issue  of  endangered  species,  with  salmon,  treaty rights  to  Native  Americans,  where there  are  conflicts  in  terms  of  barge traffic on the rivers, recreational users, and  power,  this  is  not  an  easy  issue; and  one  of  the  things  that  has  been clear  is  that  this  administration  is willing  to  explore  all  options,  and  even some  that  are  going  to  be  very  difficult.  Vice  President  has  reiterated the fact that he feels that until we have  a  plan  in  place,  that  we  need  to keep all these options on the table. Unfortunately,  Governor  Bush  has stepped  into  a  difficult  situation,  one that does not have an obvious solution, and  is  willing  publicly,  I  think  sadly for  political  purposes,  to  rule  out  some options without having anything in the alternative.  For  him,  evidently,  not complying  with  the  Endangered  Species Act,  not  dealing with  our  commitments  under  treaty  obligations  to  Native Americans, the extinction of salmon runs is, in fact, an option. The  area  of  clean  air  is  another  one that  is  of  great  concern,  I  think,  to  all Americans;  but  I  want  to  pause  at  this point because I have been joined by the gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr.  HINI  am  going  to  begin  a  somewhat lengthy  piece,  but  the  gentleman  from New  York,  who  is  a  member  of  the Committee  on  Appropriations  and  a tireless  champion  for  environmental interests  in  his  district,  in  his State  of New  York,  and  throughout  the  country, I know has been deeply involved in a  number  of  these  issues. He  is  a memCHEY).  GORE ber  of  the Subcommittee  on  Interior  of the  Committee  on  Appropriations  as well, and I would yield to him  if he has some  observations  or  thoughts  at  this point  as  we  have  been  discussing  these issues  as  it  relates  to  the  Vice  President,  Governor  Bush  and  the  choices before us. Mr.  HINCHEY.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the  gentleman  for  yielding  to  me,  and I  particularly  thank  the  gentleman  for taking  this  time  to  discuss  an  important issue, which has not gotten the attention  that  I  think  it  deserves  in  the context of this particular Congress. In fact, as a member of this Congress, I  have  often  felt  that we  are  fighting  a defensive  action  here,  where  we  are taking  actions  that  are  designed  to prevent  harm  from  being  done  rather than  moving  forward  in  a  positive  direction  on  a  number  of  environmental issues  that  really need  to be addressed. The Endangered Species Act is one, and I  know  that  the  gentleman  just  referenced it, that deserves a great deal of attention. The issue of CARA, a piece of legislation which is designed to protect public lands  and  open  space,  and  provide  also recreational  opportunities  both  in rural and urban settings,  is a critically important  piece  of  legislation.  A  good portion  of  that  was  advanced  in  the context  of  the  interior  bill,  which  we passed  here  just  recently  and  which was  signed  by  the  President  just  the other day. Now,  the  reason  that  that  provision advanced  in  the  interior  bill  was  in large measure a result of the leadership provided  by  the  administration,  both the President and Vice President GORE. That  interior  bill  contained  a  landmark  preservation,  if  I  am  not  mistaken  the  amount  was  $12  billion,  over a  period  of  time  for  open  space  protection,  preservation,  and  also  for  recreational  activities,  again  in  rural  but also  in  urban  settings  in  association with urban parks and things of that nature. One of the issues that I think that we really  need  to  address,  and  which  has not  gotten  enough  attention,  is  the issue  of  water  resources,  particularly fresh  water  resources.  It  is  true,  and many  people  have  observed  fairly  recently,  that  fresh  water  resources around the world, including those fresh water  resources  here  in  the  United States, are being depleted, particularly those  resources  that  lie  in  aquifers  underground. We  know  that,  for  example, in  the  great  Midwestern  section  of  our country  there  is  a  huge  underground reservoir known  as  the Ogallala, which runs from northern Texas up to the Dakotas,  and  covers  a  huge  vast  area,  or at  least  underlies  a  huge  vast  area  of the central plains. That  water  resource  contained  in that  Ogallala  underground  reservoir  is being  depleted  at  a  rather  alarming rate.  This  is  fossil  water.  In  other words,  it  is  water  that  has  lain  underground  for  centuries  and  there  is  no visible  source  of  rejuvenation  for  this aquifer.  The  fact  that  we  are  depleting it  at  such  a  rapid  rate  is  something that  ought  to  be  of  increasing  concern. Now,  the  depletion  is  primarily  for agricultural  purposes,  for  applications of  an  agricultural  nature  throughout that area, and, of course, good purpose. But  the  idea  that  we  can  continue  to drain  a  resource  in  the  belief  that  that resource  is  always  going  to  be  there and  will  not  be  depleted  is  a  false  notion.  It  is  a  basic  fallacy,  and  it  is  one with which we have to come to grips. So  I  think  that  this  issue  of  fresh water  resources  is  an  issue  that  is going  to  require  a  great  deal  of  attention  from  this  Congress  in  the  future and  from  the  next  administration. And that,  of  course,  raises  the  question  of what  kind  of  administration  do  we want  to  have  in  place  here  to  succeed the  Clinton  administration  which  will husband  these  resources  in  a  reasonable  way;  in  a  logical  and  rational  and intelligent  way.  I  think  the  answer  to that  question  becomes  quite  apparent when  we  look  at  the  choices  that  we have before us. We  have  on  the  one  hand  Governor Bush, who has a record of depletion and deterioration  of  resources  in  the  State in  which  he  is  the  executive;  and,  on the other hand, we have Vice President GORE,  who  has  a  very  deep  and  long record of environmental protection and husbanding  of  resources  going  back  to the  time when  he  served  in  this House, and  then  later  in  the Senate, and all of which  he  brought  to  his  position  as Vice President of the United States. So  I  think  as  people  make  decisions with  regard  to  this  upcoming  election, and  I  think  it  is  easy  to  lose  track  of time  around  here,  but  I  think  it  is somewhere  in  the  neighborhood  of  3 weeks  now  until November  7,  as  people begin  to  think  more  closely  about  the decision  they  are  going  to  make  with regard  to who  is  going  to  be  the  leader of  our  country  for  the  next  4  years,  I think one of the issues that they ought to  factor  into  their  decision-making  is the  issue  of  the  environment  and  who among  those  who  are  holding  themselves  out  for  this  office  for  President of  the  United  States  is  best  equipped and  has  the  knowledge  and  the  sensitivity  and  the  ability  to  care  about this  issue.  Who  is  best  equipped,  then, in  that  regard,  to  assume  the  responsibility  of  President  of  the  United States. b 1800 So  this  is  one  of  the  issues  that  is  of concern  to me  as  I  think  about  the  upcoming  election  and  I  think  about  the kind  of  leadership  that we  are  going  to need  to  carry  us  forward  into  the  21st century  at  a  time  when  environmental resources  are  going  to  be  increasingly under  adverse  pressure  and  forced  into adverse circumstances. So  that  is  a  question  which  I  hope people  will  be  thinking  closely  about as  they  make  their  decision  about  the President and Members of the Congress and  Members  of  the  Senate  as  they cast their vote on November 7.

Mr. Speaker, I think that effort alone tells  a  story  about  the  gentleman  from Virginia  (Mr.  The  gentleman from  Virginia  (Mr.  chairs  this incredible  important  committee,  and he  literally  is  the  leader  under  whom we have worked  for  these  past years  to develop,  not  only  hearings  like we  produced  on  the  Firestone  tire  recall,  but the legislation that followed it. I  do  not  know  if  my  colleagues  remember,  but  there  was  another  recall in  1978  with  Firestone  500  tires.  Following  that,  there  were  hearings;  but there  was  no  legislation.  This  year,  in 3  short  weeks,  the  Congress  and  under the  leadership  of  the  gentleman  from Virginia  (Mr.  and  the  Committee  on  Commerce  produced  the most  significant  reform  of  tire  and auto safety in 30 years. And  that  has  been  the  history  of  his leadership:  telecommunications  reform,  the  first  rewrite  of  the  Telecommunications  Act  since  1934;  financial  securities  modernization,  the  first real  modernization  of  our  Securities Act  in years and decades;  the Food and Drug  Modernization  Act,  to  make  sure that  Americans  have  safe  and  quality drugs and pharmaceuticals in our country. The  work  he  has  done  in  safe  drinking water to make sure that Americans have good safe water to drink. The  last hearing  he  chaired  today  was  on  safe water,  not  only  here  in  America,  but the  global  concerns  of  safe  water  and the  pollution  of  global  water  supplies that  are  critical  as  nations  and  ethnic groups  are  fighting  now  around  the world  over  water  supplies,  and  people are  dying  because  of  the  lack  of  good potable  water  and  clean  and  healthy sanitary conditions. The  gentleman  from  Virginia  (Mr. has  led  those  efforts  for  the last  6  years,  and  he  has  produced  remarkable  legislation  from  our  committee that has  literally broken up the monopolies  in  this  country  in  telecommunications  and  transportation. He  has  been  a  huge,  literally  a \u2018\u2018trustbuster\u2019\u2019  in  this  Nation.  He  has done more to back off unnecessary Federal  regulations  in  many  areas  of  our economy and to open it up to consumer choice  and  competition.  That  has  been the  history  of  his  tenure  as  chairman of our Committee on Commerce. I  want  to  tell  my  colleagues  something  about  him  personally  that  my colleagues may  not  know. He  spent  his 20  years  here  in  Congress  also  dedicated  to  women  and  children\u2019s  issues. The  gentleman  from Virginia  (Mr. BLILEY) has been a leader in adoptive services  and  making  sure  that  adoption was  a  real  and  viable  option  for  chilBLILEY)  LEY)  dren  in America,  and  to make  sure  not only  here  in  this  country  but  around the  world  that  adoption  was  available to  kids  and  to  parents  who  wanted  to love them. He  has  been  a  stalwart  defender  of adoptive  services all of  these years and a  promoter  of  that  as  a  means  of  protecting  and  preserving  young  life  in America  and  around  the  world.

He has been a champion of  women  health  issues.  I  am  not  sure if Members  really  know  of  his  extraordinary service in this area. Lest  we  forget,  for  20  years  he  has served  on  NATO\u2019s  parliamentary  assembly,  the  assembly  of  NATO  countries,  the  parliamentarians  who  try  to keep  the  strength  and  the  unity  and the  bonds  that  have  held  NATO  together  and  been  important  not  only  in winning  but  preserving  world  peace.

But  he  leaves  us  as  we end  this  session  to  go  back  to  Richmond,  Virginia,  a  place  where  his  career  started,  where  he  began  serving the people of America on the city council and later on as mayor. The  gentleman  from  Massachusetts (Mr.  talked  about  his  incredible  service  to  our  Nation  and  to  Richmond during those awful days when our Nation  was  coming  to  grips  with  the horror  and  the  history  of  segregation and bigotry in our country.

Mr. Deutch\u2019s security violations,  which  went  uninvestigated  for  years, exposed  the  United  States  to  far  greater harm  than  the  security  lapses  by  Dr.  Lee. Mr. Deutch made accessible at his home, current and top secret information significantly more  important  to  national  security  than the  information  transferred  by  Dr.  Lee, which  was  not  top  secret  and  in  fact  can  be found  in  the  open  or  developed  by  other countries  such  as  China  on  their  own.  The actions  of  Mr.  Deutch  posed  a  clear  and present  threat  to  national  security  whereas Dr. Lee\u2019s actions did not. Nevertheless  the  only  consequence  to  Mr. Deutch was loss of a no longer required security  clearance. Last  year Dr. Lee  lost  his  security  clearance  and  with  it  the  ability  to continue  his  work  at  LANL  to  which  he  had dedicated  the  past  20  years.  Then  in  March 1999  Dr.  Lee  lost  his  job  and  his  retirement, consequences  unheard  of  for  any  security violation  at  the  national  laboratories. Whereas  mishandling  of  classified  information  should have been an  internal matter  for DOE  and  LANL,  on  December  10,  1999,  the United  States  Attorney  brought  federal criminal  charges  that  threaten him with  life in  prison,  made  a  media  display  of  having him  arrested  at  home,  and  worked  relentlessly  to  deny  bail  and  any  conditions  of  release.  Since  December  10,  1999,  under  your authority,  Dr.  Lee  has  been  subjected  to  inhumane  conditions  during  his  pre-trial  imprisonment. The  conclusion  is  inescapable  that  this overblown  federal  case  emerged  from  the false  accusations  that  Dr.  Lee  was  engaged in espionage. The FBI has publicly stated the ensuing  investigation  of  Dr.  Lee  was  based on  racial  profiling.  The  FBI  used  intimidation,  threats  of  execution,  and  lying,  to  try to  force  a  confession  during  their  interrogation  of  Dr.  Lee.  It  can  only  be  inferred  that Dr.  Lee\u2019s  cruel  treatment  reflects  bias against  Dr.  Lee,  which  should  not  have  any place  in  the  prosecutorial  duty  to  achieve justice and fairness. Yours  is  a  critical  responsibility  to  stem the  improper  treatment  of  Dr.  Lee,  who  is presumed  to  be  innocent  of  criminal  wrongdoing. Continuing  the cruel conditions of his detention would afflict all American citizens by  diminishing  the  rights  and  freedoms  we cherish.

Petition  Recipients:  Janet  Reno,  U.S.  Attorney General; Bill Richardson, U.S. Energy Secretary; Vice President Al Gore. Petition  Sponsored  by:  Wenholee.org,  Armour Court, Freemont, CA 94536. TO RENO:  We,  the signers  of  this  petition, urge you  to  take  advantage  of  the  opportunity  afforded  you under Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations  to  free  Dr. Wen  Ho  Lee  from  his  harsh and  unjust  confinement  in  the  New  Mexico jail. Section 501.2 of Title 28 requires you to periodically reauthorize Dr. Lee\u2019s confinement. Under  this  law,  you  have  the  power  to  have Dr.  Lee  be  confined  to  his  home,  with  all necessary  security  precautions  imposed  at your  discretion.  Although  Dr.  Lee\u2019s  movement  will  remain  restricted  under  this  arrangement,  he will  at  lest  be  at  home  in  humane conditions. If  you  do  not  free  Dr.  Lee  from  jail,  then you  must  at  least  order  that  his  conditions of confinement, which have been more fit for a  mass  murderer,  be  significantly  improved. The use of shackles on Dr. Lee under any circumstances is ridiculous. As  we  make  these  requests  of  you,  we would  like  to  remind  you  that  the  government authorities already have conceded that the targeting of Dr. Lee has been entirely racially  motivated  and  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  espionage  by  Dr.  Lee.  Yet,  the  government  authorities  continue  to  persecute Dr.  Lee,  singling  him  out  on  the  basis  of  his race.  The  authorities\u2019  behavior  and  action have  angered  not  just  Chinese  Americans across  the  country\u2014but  all  Americans  who believe  that  no  one  should  be  treated  on  the basis of his or her race or ethnicity, and that discrimination,  especially  by  the  government, is simply not acceptable! Furthermore,  the  discriminatory  persecution  of  Dr.  Lee  not  only  shames  the  United States  of  America  and  its  citizens,  it  also impedes  our  nation\u2019s  efforts  to  improve human  rights  conditions  to  the  victims  of government  oppression  everywhere  else around the world. Therefore,  we,  the  people  of  America,  ask you to do the right thing and free Dr. Lee!

AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE SCIENCE,  DIRECVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE POLICY TORATE FOR AND PROGRAMS, ADWashington, DC, February 29, 2000. Hon. JANET Attorney  General,  U.S.  Washington, DC. Department  RENO, of  Justice, DEAR MADAME ATTORNEY GENERAL:  I  write on  behalf  of  the  Committee  on  Scientific Freedom and Responsibility of  the American Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science concerning  the  matter  of  the  continued  denial of bail and the conditions of pre-trial incarceration  of Dr. Wen Ho Lee. The AAAS  is the  world\u2019s  largest  multi-disciplinary  scientific  organization.  The  Committee  on  Scientific  Freedom  and  Responsibility  is charged  by  the  Association  to,  among  other things,  address  issues  related  to  the  human rights of scientists. Our  purpose  is  to  inquire  into  the  reasons for the extraordinarily restrictive conditions to which Dr. Lee has been subjected. Our disquiet  with  the  government\u2019s  treatment  of Dr.  Lee  does  not  extend  to  the  issue  of  his guilt  or  innocence,  which  will  be  decided  by our  courts  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence.  Our concern  stems  from  the  possibility  that  Dr. Lee  is  being  maltreated  and  may  have  been the  target  of  special  scrutiny  because  of  his ethnic background. This  case  has  had  an  adverse  impact  on many  of  our  colleagues  and  could  damage our  national  labs  as  a  result  of  the  hemorrhaging  of  skilled  scientists  through  resignation  or  attrition,  falling  recruitment and  a  decline  in  the  international  collaboration  that  are  so  vital  to  the  success  of  DoE programs.  There  is  some  evidence  that  such losses are already occurring. Our concerns relate to the following: We  have  been  informed  that  the  original conditions  of  detention  were\u2014and  remain\u2014 harsh  in  the  extreme.  He  is  confined  to  his cell  23  hours  each  day  and  was,  until  recently,  kept  completely  indoors.  When moved  about within  the  confines  of  the  prison, his arms and legs are shackled. His weekly  meetings  with  family  members  are  curtailed  and  monitored  and,  early  on,  he  was required  to  speak  English.  He  has  no  access to  TV  and,  at  first,  was  denied  newspapers. While  we  understand  that  these  conditions are  now  slightly  modified,  we  are  concerned that  continuing  restrictions  not  only  serve as  intimidation,  but  may  inhibit  his  ability to prepare his defense and place an enormous emotional  and  physical  burden  on  him,  his family  and  his  attorneys.  From  our  perspective,  Dr.  Lee\u2019s  pretrial  treatment  appears  to be exceedingly cruel. Court records and prosecution  documents  give  the  distinct  impression  that many measures  were  imposed  simply  because  he  has  Chinese  associates  and speaks Chinese. AAAS believes very strongly that  place  of  birth  or  ethnic  background should  never  be  used  to  impugn  the  loyalty of scientists. The  justification  for  continued  incarceration  is  that Dr. Lee,  if  released,  is  likely  to pose  a  grave  threat  to  our national  security. In  judging  the  merits  of  such  a  serious  contention,  we  hope  that  you  will  consult  with a  few  of  the  many  informed  independent weapons specialists and national security experts  who  no  longer  serve  in  government, and  who  therefore  may  provide  an  objective assessment  of  the  risk.  Should  the  Justice Department  wish  to  seek  such  expert  counsel,  an  appropriate  source  would  be  the  National Academy of Sciences. In  sum,  we  believe  it  important  that  the scientific  community  be  given  some  assurances  on  these  issues.  Otherwise,  we  worry that  serious  damage  could  be  done  to  the U.S. scientific enterprise and to this nation\u2019s future  prosperity  and  security  if  the  government  is  perceived  by  scientists  as  treating Dr.  Lee  unfairly  and  relying  on  unfounded claims  regarding  threats  to  national  security.

On  March  14,  2000  the  New  York  Academy of  Science  wrote  to  the  Attorney  General  protesting  the harsh  treatment of Wen Ho Lee. DEAR MARCH GENERAL ATTORNEY 14, 2000. RENO:  I  am writing  on  behalf  of  the  Committee  on  Human Rights  of  Scientists  of  the  New  York  Academy of Sciences.  In this we are  joining other prominent  scientific  organizations  such  as the  American  Physical  Society,  the  American  Association  for  the  Advancement  of Science,  and  the  Committee  of  Concerned Scientists  regarding  the  condition  of  detention  and  the  denial  of  bail  for  Dr.  Wen  Ho Lee  accused  of  mishandling  classified  information  at  the  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratories.  At  the  outset  we  emphasize  that  we do  not  take  a  position  on  Dr.  Lee\u2019s  guilt  or innocence  which  must  be  determined  at trial. For  more  than  20  years,  this  Committee has  been  deeply  concerned  about  governmental  treatment  and  repression  of  scientists  throughout  the  world.  Among  the cases  in  which  we  have  intervened  were those  of  Professors  Andrel  Sakharov,  Fang Li  Zhe,  Benjamin  Levich,  and  recently Alexandr  Nikitin,  to  name  just  a  few.  Often the  scientists  named  in  these  cases  were  accused  by  their  governments  of  violation  of secrecy,  treason,  and  other  high  crimes.  Our Committee  has  always  paid  close  attention to  the  conditions  under  which  these  and other  individuals  were  held  during  their  detention,  as  well  as  related  matters  such  as denial  of  bail,  access  to  counsel,  and  openness and fairness of trial. It  has  been  reported  to  us  that  the  conditions of Dr. Lee\u2019s detention have been harsh. He has  been  shackled  in  prison,  restricted  to his  cell  in  isolation,  had  his  meetings  with immediate  family  curtailed,  and  been  restricted  about  outside  information  such  as TV and newspapers.

There was no objection. f I ROD GRAMS SMITH)  SOCIAL  SECURITY  SOLVENCY The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Under the Speaker\u2019s announced policy of January 6, 1999, the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr.  is  recognized  for  60 minutes. Mr.  SMITH  of  Michigan.  Mr.  Speaker, to whoever might be looking at this session,  this  is  going  to  be  sort  of  a briefing on Social Security. Social Security has come to the  forefront  of  one  of  the  very  important issues  in  this  Presidential  debate,  certainly with every senior, certainly also with  every  worker  in  this  country  as they  now  pay more  into  the  Social  Security  tax  than  they  do  in  the  income tax,  and  certainly  for  our  kids,  our grandkids, those kids that are not born yet,  is  Social  Security  going  to  be there for them. Let  me  start  with  my  first  chart.  would  like  to  thank  Senator  from  Minnesota.  He  has  introduced  legislation  to  keep  Social  Security  solvent,  as  I  have.  I  have  been chairing the bipartisan Social Security Task  Force  of  the  Committee  on  the Budget  and,  so,  we  have  been  working on  Social  Security  for  the  last  5  years trying  to  get  public  attention  to  the fact  that  Social  Security  is  insolvent and eventually there  is going to be  less money  coming  in  than  is  required  for benefits  and  the  challenge  facing  this country if we are going to make a commitment not to reduce benefits, and we should  do  that,  not  to  increase  taxes even  further  on  workers  in  this  country, and we should do that. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt created  the  Social  Security  program  over 6  decades  ago,  he  wanted  it  to  feature a private sector component to build retirement  income.  Social  Security  was supposed to be one leg of a three-legged stool  to  support  retirees.  It  was  supposed to go hand-in-hand with personal savings and private pension plans. In  fact,  it  is  interesting,  looking  up and  researching  in  the archives  in  1935, the Senate on two occasions voted that private  personal  investments  should  be an  option  to  the  Government  handling the system. When it finally went to the conference  committee  between  the House and the Senate, it turned around strictly  to  a  Government-run  program, a pay-as-you-go program where current workers  pay  in  their  taxes  and  immediately  it  goes  out  to  current  retirees. This is Berry Pump, an intern that is going  to  be  helping  me,  from  Iowa.  So our  intern  program  is  an  excellent  opportunity  for  juniors  in  high  school. So, Berry, thank you very much. The system really is now stretched to its  limits.  Seventy-eight  million  baby boomers  begin  retiring  in  2008.  That means  they  go  out  of  the,  if  you  will, paying in mode, paying their Social Security  taxes,  to  the  taking  out  mode. And  these  baby  boomers  are  at  the high  end  of  the  income  scale,  so  they pay  a  much  higher  tax  since  our  tax now  is  12.4  percent  on  the  first  $76,000. Social  Security  expending  exceeds  tax revenues  in  2015,  and  so  the  problem  is where  do  we  start  getting  the  extra money starting in 2015. The  bottom  blip  is  Social  Security trust  funds  go  broke  in  2037,  although the  crisis  could  arrive  much  sooner. And  the  crisis  is  trying  to  come  up with  that  money.  The  danger  historically  as  we  look  at  what  has  happened through  history,  politicians  in  Washington  and  the  President,  for  example, in  1997  and  again  in  1983,  when  money was  short  to  pay  out  benefits,  legislation  was  passed  to  reduce  benefits  and increase  taxes. And  that  is why  it  is  so very  important  that  we  deal  with  this problem  now,  we  do  not  delay,  we  do not  put  it  off.  The  longer  we  put  off this  problem,  the  more  drastic  the changes  are  going  to  have  to  be.  So  I think  it  is very  important that we deal with  this  very  important  program  as soon as we can. Some  have  said,  well,  these  are  just people\u2019s  estimates  of  the  future.  Not so.  Insolvency  is  an  absolute.  Insolvency  is  certain.  We  know  how  many people  there  are  and  we  know  when they  are  going  to  retire.  We  count  the people.  We  know  what  their  ages  are. We  know  what  their  earning  is,  how much they are paying in. We know that people will live longer in retirement. When Social Security  started  in  1935, the  average  age  of  death  was  62  years. For  this  pay-as-you-go  program,  that meant  most  people  paid  in  all  their lives  but  never  took  anything  out.  It worked very well. But now the life span of  individuals  has  been  increasing  substantially.  We  know  how  much  these individuals will  pay  in, how much  they will  take  out.  The  payroll  taxes  will not  cover benefits  starting  in  2015. And the  shortfalls  will  add  up  to  $120  trillion between 2015 and 2075. So,  in  tomorrow\u2019s  dollars,  in  those inflated dollars,  it  is going to take $120 trillion  more  than  the  tax  revenue coming in from the Social Security tax to pay benefits. I suspect most of us do not know how much  really  a  trillion  dollars  is.  I  certainly  do  not.  But  you  can  compare  it maybe  with  our  annual  budget,  which now  is  approximately  $1.8  trillion  annual  budget.  It  is  a  huge  challenge. And  that  is why  it has been  so easy  for this  Chamber  and  the  Senate  and  the President not to take action on it. It is too  easy  to  demagogue.  And  with  this Chamber  running  for  election  every  2 years,  it  is  easy  to  put  it  off.  We  cannot  do  that  any  more.  It  is  not  fair  to our  kids.  It  is  not  fair  to  our  grand kids.  Our  pay-as-you-go  retirement system  will  not  meet  the  challenge  of demographic change. This is an example of workers per Social  Security  beneficiary.  Back  in  1940, there  were  38  workers  in  this  country paying  in  their  Social  Security  tax  for every  one  retiree.  Now  there  are  three workers  paying  in  their  increased  Social  Security  tax  for  every  one  retiree. And  by  2025  there  is  going  to  be  two workers  paying  in  their  Social  Security tax for every one retiree. This  was  developed  because  of  demographic  changes.  One  is  the  falling birth  rate after  the baby boomers after World  War  II.  So  the  number  of  workers has not  increased at the rate  it was in  the past. And  secondly,  the  life  span is  tremendously  increased.  So  if  you reach  retirement  age,  65,  then  on  average  you  are  going  to  live  another  18  to 20  years.  So  life  span  is  going  up,  the number  of  workers\u2019  birth  rate  is  going down,  and  that  leaves  us  with  a  huge problem of insolvency. The  little  blue  blip  on  the  top  left, maybe  it  should  be  green,  is  the  period between  now  and  someplace  around 2015  when  there  are  more  revenues coming  in  from  Social  Security  taxes than  is  used  to  pay  benefits.  The  reason there is a surplus now in the Social Security  tax  is  because  we  raised  the Social  Security  tax,  Congress  and  the President  raised  the  Social  Security tax  substantially  in  1983.  And  we  will be  looking  at  that  chart  in  a  moment. What  happens  after  2015  is  the  shortfall.  The  red  represents  how  much money  we  are  going  to  need  above  and beyond  the  Social  Security  taxes  that will be coming in from American workers. Berry will help us with  the next  five. Some  have  suggested  we  really  do not  need  to  do  anything  now  because economic growth  is great, we are going along  smoothly.  The  fact  is  economic growth  will  not  solve  the  Social  Security  problem. Let me  tell  you why. Social  Security  benefits  are  indexed  to wage  growth.  In  other  words,  the more wages  you  earn,  the  more  taxes  you pay in earlier. But when you retire, the more  benefits  you  will  get  out  because the  benefits  are  directly  related  to  the wages you earn. When  the  economy  grows,  workers pay  more  in  taxes  but  also  will  earn more in benefits when they retire. 2000 Growth makes  the numbers  look better  now  but  leaves  a  larger  hole  to  fill later.  That  is  what  has  happened. Three  years  ago,  we  were  going  to  run out  of  money  by  2012;  but  with  the economy expanding, now the projection is that we are going to have less money than  needed  3  years  later,  in  2015.  But when these people retire, then they are going  to  take  out  more.  So  over  the long run,  it does not offer a solution to Social Security. The  administration  short-term  advantages  has  used  these as  an  excuse  to b VerDate 02-OCT-2000 04:39 Oct 13, 2000 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\\CR\\FM\\A12OC7.088 pfrm02 PsN: H12PT1 ",

PRAYER  The  Chaplain,  Dr.  Lloyd  John  Ogilvie, offered the following prayer:  Dear  God,  we  praise  You  for  Your  faithfulness.  We  say  with  Jeremiah,  \u2018\u2018The  Lord\u2019s  mercies  are  new  every  morning;  great  is Your  faithfulness.\u2019\u2019\u2014  Lamentations 3:23.  We  are  profoundly  moved  by  Your  merciful kindness to us. You never give  up  on  us. When  we  forget  You,  You  infuse  our  lives  with  reminders  of  Your  consistent  love;  when  we  resist  Your  guidance,  You  find  new  ways  to  get  through  to  us;  when  hubris  becomes  a  habit, You  break  the  bond  of  self-sufficiency by showing us what we could accomplish  with  Your  supernatural  strength.  Lord  we  confess  our  need  for  humility.  It  is  a  combination  of  gratitude,  honesty,  and  courage.  We  admit  that  all  that  we  have  and  are  is  Your  gift;  we  honestly  face  the  distance  between  what  we  are  and  what  we  could  be  in  our  relationships  and  responsibilities;  we  need  courage  to  blow  the  cap  off  of  our  reservations  and  live  the  full  potential according to Your expectations.  Here we are at the beginning of a crucial  day  in  the  life  of  this  Senate.  As  we rush into the schedule, we meet You  at  the  pass.  We  don\u2019t  need  to  spin  to  win  with  You.  You  know  all  about  us.  And  so  we  simply  ask  You  to  take  our  minds  and  focus  our  intelligence  on  what  is  best  for  America,  to  take  our  wills  and  guide  us  to  choose  what  is  righteous  and  just,  and  to  take  our  voices  and  speak  Your  truth  through  them.  You  are  our  Lord  and  Saviour.

These  so-called  EPA  riders  are  primarily  report  language  which  we  believe  are  fair  and  reasonable  compromises  on  issues  where  there  are  broad  questions  and  we  need  to  bring  some  resolution.  While  everyone  may  not agree with these decisions, we have  worked  hard  to  balance  the  decisions  associated  with  this  account  to  the  overall benefit of EPA policy and  funding  needs  in  consultation  with  and  agreement with the administration.  For  FEMA,  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency,  the  VA\u2013HUD  appropriations bill  for 2001 appropriates a  total of $936.8 million for FEMA and includes  an  additional  $1.3  billion  in  disaster  relief  contingency  funds.  With  the  disaster  relief  funds  provided  here,  coupled  with  contingency  funds  already  on  hand,  funding  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  fiscal  year  2001  disaster  relief operations.  Most notable  in FEMA  funding  is the  addition  of  $30  million  above  the  Senate-  or  House-appropriated  levels  for  emergency  food  and  shelter,  for  a  total  of  $140  million.  This  popular  program  results  in  temporary housing and  food  assistance  to  thousands  of  needy  individuals  with  very  little  overhead  costs.  For  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space Administration, the VA\u2013HUD appropriations  compromise  funds  NASA  at  $14.285  billion  instead  of  $14.035  billion,  for  an  increase  of  $250  million.  This  account  includes  $5.46  billion  for  human  space  flight,  which  is  $37  million  below  the  administration  request  for  fiscal  year  2001.  This  reduction  reflects  a  NASA  request  for  a  reduction  in  this  account  in  order  to  provide  full  funding  for  the  Mars  2003  lander  program.  The  funding  includes  $6.19  billion  in  fiscal  year  2001  for  science,  aeronautics,  and  technology,  instead  of  $5.93 billion as requested by the administration,  an  increase  of  $261  million  above  the  budget  request.  Included  in  this  is  $20  million  for  Living  with  a  Star  and  $290  million  for  the  space  launch  initiative,  including  $40 million  for  alternative  access  to  the  space  station  initiative.  In  addition,  mission  support  is  funded  for  fiscal year  2001 at  $2.6  billion,  instead  of  $2.58  billion,  an  increase  of  $24.7 million  over  the  budget request.  For  the  National  Science  Foundation\u2014and  this  is a very  important area  for  the  ranking  member  and  me\u2014the  VA\u2013HUD  compromise  funds  NSF  at  $4.43  billion,  a  $529  million  increase  over  the  fiscal  year  2000  enacted  level  and  $146  million  below  the  President\u2019s  request.  Funding  highlights  include  $215 million for information technology  research,  $150  million  for  nanotechnology,  and  $65  million  for  plant  genome  research.  Lastly,  to  assist  smaller  research  institutions,  $75  million  was  included  for  EPSCoR,  a  $20  million  inMIKULSKI MIKULSKI year\u2019s  Office  level,  and  $10  of  Innovation  crease  over  last  million  for  the  Partnerships.  We  believe  very  strongly  the  scientific exploration  in  space needs  to be  spread  broadly  throughout  the  land  to  ensure  we  achieve  inclusion  of  knowledgeable and dedicated scientists at institutions  which may  not  traditionally  have received funding in the past.  I  consider  NSF  a  priority  account  that  needs  additional  funding  in  order  to  pace  U.S.  leadership  in  science  and  technology.  Senator  and  I  have  heard  from  leading  scientists  in  this  country  who  say  that  we  are  falling  behind  because  we  are  not  providing  enough  funding  for  the National  Science  Foundation.  Medical  doctors  who  depend  directly  upon  the  research  work done at the National Institutes of  Health  have  come  to  us  and  said  that  we  must  bring  NSF  funding  up  to  NIH  funding  because  so  many  of  the  health  breakthroughs  on  which  NIH  is  working  depend  upon  the  support  the  National Science Foundation provides.  Senator  and  I  have  launched  an  effort  to  double  the  NSF  budget. We have circulated a letter and  have a significant number of colleagues  who  have  joined  with  us.  We  will  be  back. We will be asking the  full Senate  to  recognize  a  priority  in  the  National  Science  Foundation  and  help  get  us  on  that path for the next year.  Finally, for the National Service Corporation,  the  VA\u2013HUD  fiscal  year  2001  appropriations  compromise  appropriates  $458  million,  a  $25  million  increase  over  last  year\u2019s  level  and  $75  million  below  the  budget  request.  Further,  $30 million will be  rescinded  from  excess  funds  in  the  National  Service  Trust.  The  compromise  also  funds  the  Community  Development  Financial  Institutions Fund  at  $118 million,  a  $23 million  increase  over  last  year\u2019s  level  and  $7 million below the request.  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  Senator from Maryland.  Ms.  MIKULSKI.  Mr.  President,  I  begin  by  thanking  my  colleague,  Senator  BOND,  as  well  as  our  colleagues  Senator  and  Senator  for  enabling  us  to  move  our  bill  forward.  I  particularly  express  my  appreciation  to  Senator  for  his  collegial  and  civil  way  of  including  me  in  all  discussions  related  to  both  the  funding  and  policy  that  we  developed  in  this  bill.  His  courtesy  and  collegiality are very much appreciated.  I  believe  today  the  bill  we  present  takes  care  of  national  needs  and  national  interests.  I  am  also  confident  that  it  will  be  signed  by  President  Bill  Clinton  because  it  takes  care  of  the  day-to-day  needs  of  the  American  people and at the same time looks forward  to helping with the  long-range needs of  our country  to  remain competitive and  on the cutting edge of science.  This bill has always been to me about  five  things:  meeting  our  obligations  to  our veterans\u2014promises made, promises  STEVENS,  BYRD BOND us  BOND BOXER,  kept;  investing  in  our  neighborhoods  and  our  communities  promoting  self-  help;  creating  real  opportunities  for  people  to  move  from  welfare  to  work,  to make sure that public housing is not  a way of  life but a way  to a better  life;  and,  of  course,  advancing  science  and  technology,  the  new  ideas  that  lead  to  the new jobs and the new products. It is  also  about  protecting  consumers  from  fraud and scams and communities from  floods and disasters.  I  believe  we  meet  the  goals  in  this  bill,  and  we  have  done  it  in  a  fiscally  prudent  way.  While  I  support  the  bill,  the process has left much to be desired;  again  no  fault  of  Chairman  but  really  the  Senate  has  placed  in  a  very awkward situation.  The  bill  before  the  Senate  today  is  a  managers\u2019  substitute  for  the  Senate  bill.  This  is  effectively  our  conference  report.  We  did  not  have  a  conference  report,  though  we met. We  had  kind  of  a  chatroom  where  we  would  meet  and  try  to  iron  out  our  differences. We  did.  It  also  involved  OMB  and  the  White  House  for  consultation.  We  wanted  to  be  sure  both  sides  of  the  aisle  would  support  the  bill.  We  also  wanted  to  be  sure  that  the  President  would  sign  the  bill. I believe we achieved this.  I  say  to my  colleagues,  it  will  be  absolutely  crucial,  in  order  to  move  this  bill with this unique parliamentary situation,  to  have  no  amendments  to  this  legislation.  My  colleague  from  California,  Senator  will  offer  two  amendments.  I  am  going  to  oppose  them.  I  am  going  to  oppose  them  both  on procedural and  substantive grounds.  On procedure, if the Boxer amendments  prevail,  we  will  have  enormous  difficulty  reconvening  and  working  with  the  House  to  pass  this  bill.  I  just  put  that out.  Though  we  had  an  unofficial  conference,  I  do  believe  we  were  able  to  move  forward.  Senator  has  outlined  in  detail what we were  able  to  do  financially.  I am  so glad we worked  together  on  a  bipartisan  basis,  particularly  in  the  area  of  veterans  health  care,  joining  hands,  scrutinizing  the  budget  and  then  the  appropriations  to  make  sure  that  veterans  health  care  will  be  funded  $1.4  billion  over  last  year\u2019s level.  We  also  want  to  look  ahead  to  be  sure,  while  we  are  taking  care  of  the  men  and  women  who  bear  the  permanent wounds  of war, we  do  the medical  research,  to  find  the  cures  for  those  things  affecting  our  veterans  population.  This  legislation  provides  $350  million  for  medical  and  prosthetic  research,  $30  million  over  last  year.  I  have  seen  the  work  at my  own  University  of Maryland  and  know  that  people  will  live  longer,  live  better,  and  recover  more  quickly  because  of  the  funding  for  veterans  health  care  research which also goes into the civilian  population.  Also,  we  have  added  more  money,  $100 million,  for  State  veterans  homes.  This  is  to  provide  long-term  care  and  rehabilitation, which  is very crucial.

            "110": "October 12, 2000  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE S10299  the Council  on Environmental Quality.  The President\u2019s chief adviser on the environment  was  on  the  phone  with  the  legal counsel at EPA. We did not make  this up.  I  thought  I  was  proceeding  on  safe  grounds  because  of  the  advice  I  received  from  the  Council  on  Environmental  Quality.  I  say  to  my  Democratic  colleagues:  Do  you  believe  in  a  letter  from  21  groups  or  do  you  believe  in President Clinton\u2019s Council on Environmental  Quality?  The  choice  is  there.  Do  you  believe  the  advocacy  analysis  or  President  Clinton\u2019s  analysis?  I  go  with  President  Clinton  because  I  believe  there  is  a  track  record  on protecting the environment.  What  about  arsenic?  It  does  not  shackle  anybody.  It  delays  it  by  6  months.  Under  the  current  law,  EPA  must  give  the  regs  by  January  2001.  They  can  issue  them  at  any  time up  to  2001.  EPA  retains  its  authority  and  its  flexibility  to  issue  the  regs  any  time,  but  it  removes  the  old  deadline.  Why  do  we  do  this?  So  small  rural  communities  can  have  time  to  get  EPA  information, cost, and other things they are  going to need to comply.  Let\u2019s go to the ozone. That court case  is  before  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States.  It  is  not  going  through  some  small  court.  It  is  in  the  Supreme  Court.  They  are  going  to  decide  it  in  June.  The  Court  term  ends  in  June.  This  language  will  no  longer  apply  once  the  Court  issues  its  ruling.  Also,  the language becomes moot in 2001.  Why  was  this  language  added?  To  prevent  EPA  from  making  new  attainment  designations  and  then  have  the  Supreme  Court  invalidate  them.  We  are  saying,  let  the  Court  act  and move  on.  At  the  same  time,  EPA  is  allowed  to go on with  its own planning process.  Once  the  Supreme  Court  acts,  EPA  is  good to go.  We  are  not  shackling  anybody.  We  are  not  stymying  anybody.  I  believe  in  each  of  these  instances  there  is  flexibility  to  meet  the  compelling  needs  of  public  health.  If  they  did  not  have  that,  I  would  not  have  supported  it.  If  President  Clinton\u2019s  own  team  did  not  tell  me  it  was  OK  to  do  this,  I  would  not have done it.  I  stand  on  the  advice  we  were  given,  and I believe the advice is accurate, responsible,  and  reliable.  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  defeat  the  Boxer  amendments.  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my  colleague from Maryland. I yield 3 minutes  to  the  junior  Senator  from  Idaho.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The  junior Senator from Idaho.  Mr.  CRAPO.  Mr.  President,  Senator  and  Senator  As  chairman  of  the  Fisheries,  Wildlife  and  Drinking  Water  Subcommittee,  I  rise  today  in  strong  opposition  to  the  amendment  to  prevent  the  EPA  from  having the time necessary to produce a  proper  arsenic  drinking  water  rule  based on the available science. It is important  to  note  that  in  1996  this  Congress  directed  the  EPA  to  adopt  a  speMIKULSKI.  thank  BOND I  BOND MIKULSKI cific  schedule  to  propose  an  arsenic  standard to allow for a full year of public  review  and  comments  by  scientific  experts  and  then  to  implement  a  rule  after  taking  into  consideration  those  comments.  That  is what  is  at  stake.  It  is  important  to  follow  up  on  what  Senators  and  have  said  about  what  this  amendment  really  does.  It  has  been  characterized  as  stopping  the  EPA  from  protecting  us  from  arsenic  problems.  The  reality  is  that  all  this  amendment does  is give the EPA up  to an additional 6 months to complete its work.  In  fact, I am quite surprised to see this  amendment today because the administration  itself has  said  they do not have  the ability  to meet  the  statutory deadline,  and  they  need  this  extra  time  to  make  sure  the  rule  they  adopt  is  scientifically  justified  and  does  not  cause  the  immense  damage  to  local  small  communities  in  rural  areas  that  is  of  concern.  We  have  held  hearings  on  this  issue  in our subcommittee, and witness after  witness  has  raised  questions  about  whether  the  science  is  there  to  justify  the  direction  in  which  the  EPA  is  going.  The  EPA  has  acknowledged  these  questions.  The  EPA  has  said  it  needs  time  to  further  review  the  science,  and  the  EPA  has  said  it  will  take  that  time  if we  give  it  to  them  to  do  a  good  rule  that  will  protect  the  country  and  yet  not  do  damage  to  small communities in rural areas.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  this  amendment  does  not  stop  the  EPA  from  acting  at  any  time  the  EPA  deems  it  is  ready  to  act.  If  the  EPA  says  it  has  the  process  finalized,  it  has  the  science  understood  and  is  ready  to  proceed,  they  can  proceed  tomorrow,  they  can  proceed  in  November  or  December  or  January  when  the  statutory  deadline  exists.  Again,  the  EPA  has  told us  they are not  ready  to do  so and  that  they  need  this  extra  time.  We  believe  they  need  the  extra  time  because  of  the  impending  damage  that  could  be  caused  to  local  communities  across  this country.  As  Senator  has  said,  there  are  communities  and  individual  families  who  will  see  their  water  bills  go  up  by  hundreds  of  dollars.  There  are  communities  that  probably will  have  to  go  off  their  systems  because  of  this.  The  potential  damage  if  we  do  not  give  the  EPA the time to act properly and to review  the  comments  is  immense,  and  that  is  why  I  must  oppose  this  amendment. I yield back the remainder of my  time.  Mr.  BOND.  Mr.  President,  I  reserve  the  time  that  has  been  allocated  to  various Members. I now allocate 3 minutes  to  the  distinguished  senior  Senator from Idaho.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The  senior Senator from Idaho is recognized.

Mr.  President,  on  behalf  of the leadership, I ask unanimous consent  that  the  Senate  proceed  to  the  DOD  authorization  conference  report  following the consideration and vote on  H.R.  4516  on  Thursday;  that  the  conference  report  be  considered  as  having  been  read  and  debated  under  the  following  agreement:  2  hours  under  the  control  of  the  chairman  of  the  Armed  Services  Committee;  21\u20442 hours  under  the  control  of  Senator  1  hour  under the control of Senator GRAMM; 30  minutes  under  the  control  of  Senator  that  following  the  debate  just  outlined,  Senator  be  recognized  to  make  a  point  of  order,  and that the motion to waive the Budget Act be  limited  to  2 hours equally divided  in  the  usual  form.  I  further  ask  unanimous  consent  that  following  the  use or yielding back of time on the motion  to  waive,  the  Senate  proceed  to  vote  on  the  motion  and,  if  waived,  a  vote  occur  immediately  on  adoption  of  the  conference  report,  without  any  intervening action, motion, or debate.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Is  there  objection?  Mr.  REID.  Mr.  President,  reserving  the  right  to  object,  this  is  the  agreement we have been attempting to work  out  for  the  last  day.  This  is  something  Senator  and  Senator  have  worked  on  very  hard.  It  is  a  good  bill.  We,  on  this  side,  think  the  agreement  is  something  that  will  be  to  the  benefit  not  only  of  the  Senate  but  the  country.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Is  objection?

Mr.  President,  I  thank  the  chairman  of  my  subcommittee  for  yielding.  I  say  to  the  Senator  from  California,  her  amendment  is  a  perfect  example  of  no  good  deed  goes  unpunished.  I  say  that  to  the Senator  from California  for  this  very  simple  reason.  This  language  has  been  worked  out  with  all  of  the  parties,  and  all  of  the  staffs,  with  the  administration,  and  with  the  EPA.  While  they  do  not  like  it,  they  understand their science, and where they are  does  not  justify,  at  this  time,  the  kind  of  regulation  they  are  attempting  to  bring down.  From  the  State  of  the  Senator  from  California,  let me  read  from  the  Indian  Wells  Valley  Water  District.

            "118": "October 12, 2000  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE S10307  England  issue.  There  is  not  a  community  in  the  United  States  of  America  that  you  go  to  today  where  there  are  not  people  having  an  extraordinarily  difficult  time  being  able  to  find  adequate housing.  The  reason  is  partly  something  we  can celebrate, in the sense it comes out  of  an  economy  that  is  so  extraordinarily strong. But, on the other hand,  because  it  is  so  strong  and  so  many  people  are  able  to  afford  the  few  available  places,  the  rents  have  risen  to  a  point  where  even  some  vouchers  are  being  refused.  So  we  are  upping  the  number  of  vouchers  in  this  legislation  to  some  80,000  new  vouchers,  but  there  is no place for anybody to take them.  The  result  is,  even  as  we  live  in  a  time  of  extraordinary  economic  expansion, too many of our fellow Americans  are  not  sharing  on  the  up  side  and  are  finding  it  increasingly  difficult  to  find  decent housing. HUD estimates that 5.4  million  low-income  households  have  what we  call worst  case  housing  needs.  These  families  are  paying  over  half  their  income  towards  housing  costs  or  they  are  living  in  severely  substandard  housing.  Since  1950,  the  number  of  families  with  worst  case  housing  needs  has  increased  by  12  percent.  That  means  600,000  more  of  our  fellow  citizens  cannot  afford  a  decent  and  safe  place  to  live,  even  though  the  United  States  of  America has the best economy we have  had  in maybe half a  century. For  these  families,  living  paycheck  to  paycheck,  one  simple  unforeseen  circumstance  such as a child getting sick or a big car  repair  bill  or  some  other  kind  of  emergency  can  send  them  into  homelessness. That is not an exaggeration.  Earlier this year, on the front page of  the  Washington  Post,  an  article  detailed  these  problems  right  here  in  our  own  backyard,  the  Nation\u2019s  Capital.  That  article  detailed  the  plight  of  low-  income  families  living  in  apartments  that  are  no  longer  affordable  because  the  owners  decided  to  no  longer  accept  Federal  assistance.  For  those  families,  the  loss  of  their  affordable  housing  unit  meant  they  could  go  without  a  home.  We  have  mistakenly  viewed  this  crisis  as  limited  to  certain  demographic  groups.  I  really  caution  my  colleagues  not  to  fall  into  that  stereotype.  There  is  not  one  metropolitan  area  in  the  country where a minimum wage earner  can afford  to pay  the  rent  for  the average  two-bedroom  apartment.  The  minimum  wage  today\u2014is  it  $5.15?  You  would  have  to  earn  over  $12  an  hour  to  afford  the  median  rent  for  the  average  two-bedroom  apartment  in  this  country.  That  figure  rises  dramatically  in  many metropolitan areas.  An  hourly  wage  of  $28  is  needed  in  San  Francisco;  $23  on  Long  Island;  $19  in Boston; $17 in Washington, DC, $16 in  Chicago  and  in  Seattle,  and  $15  in  Atlanta.  In  every  one  of  these  cases,  the  affordability  crisis  has  grown  worse  over the course of the past year. Working  families  are  increasingly  finding  themselves  unable  to  afford  a  house.  A  person  in  Boston  would  have  to  make  over  $35,000 a year  just  to afford a  two-  bedroom  apartment,  and  we  know  that  is  well  above  the  median  earnings  of  folks  in  that  area\u2014as  well,  I  might  add, as most of the country.  In  Cape  Cod,  MA,  a  working  mother  of three children has been forced to live  in a  camper. The  children actually  live  in  a  tent  because  the  camper  is  not  large  enough.  The  mother  cooks  on  an  outdoor  grill.  She  cleans  the  campground  toilets  to  help  pay  the  rent  on  her  campsite.  She  works  40  hours  a  week,  earns  $21,000  annually,  and  she  cannot find affordable rental housing.  There  was  another  article  in  the  Washington  Post  this  week  which  emphasizes  the  impact  of  this  issue.  Because  of  the  ability  of  higher  wage  earners in this area who have benefited  from  the  booming  economy  to  pay  higher  housing  costs,  we  have  seen  a  rise  in  the  number  of  building  owners  who  refuse  to  rent  to  households  that  are  assisted  by  section  8  vouchers.  In  Prince  Georges  County,  300  tenants  in  an  apartment  complex  were  recently  told  they  have  to  move  because  the  owner  is  no  longer  going  to  accept  section 8.  I  know  the  Senator  from  Missouri  understands  everything  I  have  thus  far  said  and  supports  the  notion  that  we  need a production program. I am grateful  to  the  Senator  from  Missouri  for  having  not  just  seen  that,  but  put  $1  billion  into  this  bill  for  housing  production.  That  is  how  this  bill  went  to  the  conference  level.  That  bill  could  have  received  support  from  the  House  and  the  administration  that  would  have left us in a position to fund.  When  people  say:  Senator,  what  about  the  cap?  What  about  the  total  amount of money? In this year, the 2001  budget  cycle,  as  a  matter  of  priority,  the  administration  and  others  are  choosing  to  pay  down  $200  billion  of  debt. I am all for debt paydown. I know  that  is  a  tax  cut  to  all  Americans.  I  have  been  one  of  those  here  who  has  supported the concept that we ought to  pay  off  the  debt  as  rapidly  as  we  possibly  can.  But  the  key  is  in  the  words  \u2018\u2018as rapidly as we possibly can.\u2019\u2019 Maybe  we  should  add  words  such  as  \u2018\u2018as  is  appropriate,\u2019\u2019  or  \u2018\u2018as  is  measured  against  other priorities of the country.\u2019\u2019  I  do  not  know  where  it  is  written  in  stone or otherwise made an edict of the  budgeting  process  that  we  have  to  choose  to  pay  down  $200  billion  instead  of  paying  down  $199  billion  or  $198  billion,  or  some  other  figure.  Would  it  really  be  so  bad  if  the  United  States  took 1 year  longer to pay off the entire  debt  while  sufficiently  addressing  the  question of adequate housing for American families today?  The Senator  from Missouri  sought  to  put  $1  billion  into  this  bill.  So  we  are  making our own priorities.  I  say  to my  colleagues,  as  a  matter  of  common  sense  and  sound  investment  policy  in  the  future  of  the  country,  it  makes  sense  to  invest  in  production  of  housing  for  people  who  cannot  afford  it  because  the  alternative  is  that  you  have  a  lot  of  kids  who  are  dragged  out  of  schools,  moving  from  community  to  community,  often  becoming  at  risk  as  a  consequence  of  the  lack  of  adequate  housing.  We  will  pick  up  their  costs.  We  will  pick  up  their  costs  when  some  Senator comes to the  floor and says we  need  more  Federal  assistance  to  build  prisons;  or  we  need  more  Federal  assistance  for the  juvenile  justice system  to  take  care  of  those  kids who  are  getting into trouble; or we need more Federal  assistance  for  the  drug  program  because  we  have  too  many  crack  houses and too many communities that  are magnets for crime.  Why? Because we don\u2019t allow them to  become  the  kinds  of  communities  we  want  them  to  be  by  investing  up  front  in  creating  the  kind  of  housing  the  country  needs.  It  is  inexcusable,  in  a  nation  as  rich  as  we  are,  doing  as  well  as  we  are,  that  we  cannot  find  $1  billion to make certain we have a production  program  to  help  build  the  kind  of  housing  that  will  release  the  pressures  on  the  marketplace  and  can  be  felt  all  up  and  down  the  ladder  in  housing  costs in the country.  Some colleagues will say: Why should  the Federal Government do that? Years  ago,  we  made  a  commitment  in  this  country  about  housing.  We  have  come  to  understand  that  there  are  certain  things  the  marketplace  doesn\u2019t  always  do  very  well.  I  happen  to  believe  we  have  the  most  efficient  allocation  of  capital  of  any  economic  system  anywhere  on  the  face  of  the  planet.  I  am  proud  of  that.  I  support  that  in  dozens  of  ways\u2014through  the  Small  Business  Committee,  Banking  Committee,  Commerce  Committee,  tax  incentives,  various  ways  in  which  we  allow  the  private  sector  to  do  what  it  does  best,  which  is  create  jobs.  But  sometimes  there  are  certain  sectors  of  the  economy  where  the  marketplace  does  not  work  as  efficiently.  We  have  always  recognized  that  with  one  kind  of  tax  incentive  or  tax  credit  or  direct  grant  or  other  kind  of  incentive  or  another.  Housing  just  happens  to  be  one  of  them.  When the supply is very tight and the  demand  is very high, you have a capacity for rents to rise and you have builders  targeting  their  building  to  that  place  where  they  can  make  the  most  money.  That  is  a  natural  instinct  in  a  marketplace where  you  are  looking  for  the greatest return on investment. You  do not get your great  return on  investment from the sectors where the people  can least afford the rents.  That  is  why  we  need  a  production  program,  and  that  is  why  I  hope  in  these final days before the Congress adjourns  we  will  find  our  way  to  include  in  the omnibus bill  the production program  we  need  so  desperately.  I  thank  the Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FITZGERALD). The  time  of  the Senator  from  Massachusetts has expired.  There  are  now  20 minutes  equally  divided among the managers of the bill.

            "126": "October 12, 2000  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE S10315  the  environment.  However,  the  Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority  to  issue  the  8-hour  standard  is  currently  under  review  by  the  United  States  Supreme  Court.  The  Court  will  hear argument on November 7 to decide  whether  to  uphold  a  Court  of  Appeals  decision  that  invalidated  the  8-hour  standard on  the grounds  that  the agency  had  assumed  an  \u2018\u2018unconstitutional  delegation  of  legislative  power.\u2019\u2019  Even  the  EPA  has  agreed  that  it  cannot  actually  implement  efforts  with  respect  to  the  8-hour  standard.  Until  the  Supreme  Court  hears  this  case, we  do  not  know  whether  the  EPA  even  had  the  authority  to  make  this  new  rule.  Therefore,  I agree  that  the EPA  should  refrain  from  using  the  standard\u2014a  standard  that  may  be  struck  down  as  unenforceable\u2014until  the  Supreme  Court  has  made  its  determination  regarding  the  constitutionality  of  the  EPA\u2019s actions.  Now  this  isn\u2019t  a  frivolous  matter.  A  nonattainment  designation  can  detrimentally  affect  an  area  and,  if  not  justified,  would  cause  needless  economic  hardship,  such  as  costly  transportation  conformity  measures,  should  the Supreme Court rule that the 8-hour  standard  is  unenforceable.  Further,  this  standard  could  impose  unfair  economic  burdens  on  a  number  of  communities  in Michigan that suffer  from significant  ozone  and  other  pollution  transported  from  more  severely  polluted  areas.  And  it  could  be  all  for  nought  if  the  Supreme  Court  strikes  down the standard.  Mr.  President,  I  support  the  goals  of  the Clean Air Act. However, it needs to  be applied in a common sense equitable  manner  if  it  is  to  retain  the  support  of  the  American  People.  It  is  not  equitable  to  designate  an  area  in  nonattainment  if that designation may become  null  and  void  in  a  matter  of  months.  For  these  reasons  I  voted  against the Boxer Amendment.  Mr.  SAM  JOHNSON  of  Texas.  Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased  that,  with  my  support,  the  Senate  took  another  step  today  toward  fulfilling  our  country\u2019s  commitment  to  provide health  care  for  our  veterans.  The  fiscal  year  2001  VA\u2013  HUD Appropriations Conference Report  that  passed  the  Senate  this  afternoon  contains  a  $1.4  billion  increase  in  veterans health care funding from the last  year\u2019s appropriations level.  While  I  am  pleased  that  we  have  finally come around to talking about additional  funding  for  veterans  health  care,  as  opposed  to  three  years  of  flat-  line  budget  levels,  I  am  disappointed  that  the  funding  level  in  the  FY2001  VA\u2013HUD  Appropriations  Conference  Report  falls  short  of  the  level  proposed  by veterans organizations.  The  authoritative  Independent  Budget  is  produced  by  major  veterans  organizations  including  AMVETS,  the  Disabled  American  Veterans,  the  Paralyzed  Veterans  of  America,  and  the  VFW. The  Independent Budget and The  American  Legion  agree  that  the  Veterans Administration will need at least  pro$500  million  more  in  funding  than  vided by this conference report.  I  am  pleased  to  have  led  the  effort  last year  in the Senate to  increase veterans health  care  funding. Through my  efforts  on  the  Senate  Budget  Committee  and  on  the  Senate  floor,  we  were  able  to  start  reversing  the  negative  effects  of  three  years  of  flat-lined  veterans  health  care  budgets  with  an  increase  of  $1.7  billion.  I  am  pleased  that  my  efforts  appear  to  have  convinced  the  Administration  and  Members  of  Congress  to  start  talking  about  increases  in  veterans  health  care  funding instead of keeping this budget stagnant.  This year,  I was  successful  in getting  a  bipartisan  amendment  passed  to  the  Senate  Budget  Resolution  that  added  an  additional  $1.9  billion  to  last  year\u2019s  funding  for  veterans  health  care.  The  conference  report  that  passed  the  Senate  today  fell  $500 million  short  of  this  goal and will prevent  the VA  from adequately  funding a number of  important  programs  including  medical  care,  research,  long  term  care,  and  necessary  facility construction and renovation.  While  the  $1.4  billion  increase  in  this  year\u2019s  VA  budget  and  the  $1.7  billion  increase  from  last  year  are  important  improvements,  I\u2019m afraid  the  funds are  simply providing budgetary backfill for  the  years  when  the  veterans  health  care  needs were  ignored. We  need  a VA  veterans\u2019  health  care  budget  that  can  adequately  offset  years  of  underfunding,  the  higher  costs  of  medical  care  caused  by  consumer  inflation,  wage  increases,  and  legislation  passed  by  Congress.  For  the  first  time  in  a  number  of  years,  we\u2019re  working  with  overall  budget  surpluses  instead  of  budget  deficits.  Clearly,  the  funds  are  there  to  provide  for  veterans  health  care. It is simply a question of whether  the  political  will  is  there  to make  veterans  health  care  a  priority  instead  of  an afterthought.  As  a  member  of  the  Senate  Budget  Committee,  I  will  continue  to  do  all  I  can  to  encourage  my  colleagues  to  approve  adequate  funding  levels  for  veterans  health  care.  I  look  forward  to  continue working  on  a  bipartisan  basis  with  my  Senate  colleagues  as  well  as  with  representatives  of  the  veterans  community in South Dakota.  Mr.  WELLSTONE.  Mr.  President.  I  rise  to  speak  about  a  provision  in  the  VA,  HUD  and  Independent  Agencies  Appropriations  bill,  which  was  passed  by  the  Senate  today.  Specifically,  I  want  to  speak  about  the  substantial  backlog of civil rights claims that have  been filed with the Environmental Protection  Agency\u2019s,  EPA,  Office  of  Civil  Rights, OCR.  As  my  colleagues  know,  Title  VI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  provides  that  no  person  in  the  United  States  shall,  on  the  grounds  of  race,  color,  or  national  origin,  be  excluded  from  participation  in,  be  denied  the  benefits  of,  or  be  otherwise  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any  program  or  activity  receiving  federal  financial  assistance.  For thirty-five years, this  law has been  a  cornerstone  of  our  nation\u2019s  civil  rights  protections.  To  better  implement Title VI  in  federal environmental  programs,  President  Clinton  issued  an  Executive  Order  in  1994  requiring  each  federal  agency  \u2018\u2018to  make  achieving  environmental  justice  part  of  its mission  by  identifying  and  addressing,  as  appropriate,  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  human  health  or  environmental effects of its programs, policies,  and  activities  on  minority  populations.\u2019\u2019  Under  EPA\u2019s  Title  VI  implementing  regulations,  40  CFR  Section  7,  EPA-  funded  permitting  agencies  are  prohibited  from taking actions  in the permitting  process  that  are  intentionally  discriminatory  or  have  a  discriminatory  effect  based  on  race,  color,  or  national  origin.  Under  these  regulations  OCR  is  required  to  \u2018\u2018promptly\u2019\u2019  investigate  all  complaints  filed  under  Title  VI  unless  all  parties  agree  to  a  delay  [40  CFR  Section  7.120].  OCR  is  first  required  to  initiate complaint proceedings within 5  days  of  receipt  of  a  complaint  [40  CFR  Section  7.120(d)].  Then  it  must  review  the  complaint  for  acceptance,  rejection,  or  referral  to  another  agency  and  make a determination within 25 days of  the  receipt  of  the  complaint  [40  CFR  Section  7.120(d)(1)].  If  a  complaint  is  accepted,  EPA  must  make  a  preliminary  finding  in  the  matter,  including  recommendations,  if  any,  for  achieving  voluntary  compliance,  and  OCR  must  notify  the  recipient  of  these  finding  within 180 days of the start of the complaint  investigation.  [40  CFR  Section  7.120(d)(2)].  Unfortunately  according  to  the  OCR\u2019s most  recent  log  of  cases  filed  on  October 4, 2000, 103 Title VI claims have  been  filed  since  September  1993.  Of  these, over half, 56 cases, are still pending.  The  remainder  were  either  rejected  or  dismissed  over  jurisdictional  issues.  Eleven  of  the  still  active  cases  have  been  pending  for  5  years  or more,  without  resolution.  Only  one  case  has  been resolved by a decision of the OCR,  which  found  that  there  was  not  a  legally recognizable \u2018\u2018adverse impact\u2019\u2019 on  the community and denied the community\u2019s request for reconsideration.  To  further  complicate  resolution  for  these civil rights claims, in 1998 a rider  was  inserted  in  the  VA\u2013HUD  Appropriations  bill  that  blocked  the  implementation  or  administration  of  the  interim  Guidance  to  enforce  Title  VI  claims  issued  on  February  5,  1998.  This  rider  has  effectively  stopped  the  EPA  from  investigating  and  responding  to  claims  of  race  or  national  origin  discrimination  that  have  been  filed  with  the  Agency  after  October,  1998.  That  same  rider  has  been  on  all  subsequent  VA/HUD bills, including this one.  This  summer  the  EPA  revised  it\u2019s  Guidance,  which  was  noticed  in  the  Federal  Register  for  public  comment.  The  revision  is  titled  \u2018\u2018Draft  Revised  Guidance for Investigating Title VI Administrative  Complaints  Challenging  Permits.\u2019\u2019  I  am  pleased  that  the  rider,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:15 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S12OC0.REC S12OC0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",

            "150": "Without  DOMENICI,  WELLSTONE,  is  approfollow  the  House  committee.  Chairman  has  served many  years.  He  was  a World War II veteran in the Navy and  rose  to  the  rank of captain. He has had  a distinguished public  service  record  in  the  United  States.  It  is  most  fitting  that this bill be named in his honor.  Mr.  President,  I  see  the  presence  of  our  distinguished  colleague  from  Alabama.  Perhaps  he  would  like  to  follow  the Senator from Minnesota.  Mr.  SESSIONS.  If  that  priate,  I  will  be  honored  to  Senator.  Mr.  WARNER.  Senator  to  be  correct.  Mr.  President,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  he  be  recognized  following Senator WELLSTONE.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  objection, it is so ordered.  Mr.  WARNER.  Mr.  President,  unless  the managers, Mr. LEVIN or myself,  for  some reason need to be recognized.  For  the  second  year  in  a  row,  the  conference report before the Senate authorizes  a  real  increase  in  defense  spending. We have built on the momentum  of  last  year  by  authorizing  $309.9  billion  in new  budget  authority  for Defense  for  the  fiscal  year  2001,  $4.6  billion  above  the  request  of  the President  of the United States.  That  additional  funding  over  and  above  the  President\u2019s  request  was  the  result of the actions of many Senators,  most  particularly  our  Senate  leadership,  Republican  and  Democratic,  the  Budget  Committee  chairman,  Senator  the  ranking  member,  and  others,  and  I  certainly  had  a  strong  hand  in  it. We  had  a  record  to  take  before  the  Senate  to  justify  that  increase,  and  that  record,  in  large  measure,  was  put  together  by  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff;  specifically,  the  Chiefs  of  the  Services  who  have  periodically  come  before  the  Congress  and,  in  accordance  with  the  clear  understanding  between  the  Congress  and  the  Service  Chiefs,  to  give  us  their  opinions  with  regard  to  the needs  for  their  respective  military  departments  and,  indeed,  the  other  departments.  They  give  us  those  professional  opinions,  even  though  those opinions at times are at variance  with  the  statements  of  the  President,  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  and  possibly  even  the  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of Staff.  The  Service  Chiefs  have  come  forward  repeatedly  and  told  us  about  the  needs  over  and  above  budget  requests.  Therefore,  at  this  time,  I  specifically  thank them for their service and thank  them  also  for  standing  up  for  those  in  uniform  and  their  families  in  their  respective military departments.  When  you  are  down  there, whether  it  is  an  enlisted  man  or  junior  officer,  looking  up  to  those  four-stars,  it  is  a  long  way,  but  they  are  the  leaders  and  they  are  the  most  trusted  of  all,  the  most  unbiased.  When  it  comes  to  politics,  there  is  not  a  trace.  They  are  there for the interest of our Nation and  most  specifically  for  those  who  every  day  follow  their  orders.  I  thank  them.  They  confirmed  what  we  all  know:  That  today,  the  U.S.  military  is  overdeployed  and  underresourced,  resource  in  terms  of  people,  dollars,  procurement, and O&M funds. I will go into detail  about  them  in  the  course  of  this  debate.  Since  early  1990,  the  U.S.  military  has been sent on operations overseas at  an  unprecedented  rate.  At  the  same  time,  that  force  structure  was  reduced  by a third and defense spending was declining every year up until 2 years ago.  From  the  end  of  the  war  in  Vietnam  until  1989,  the  records  of  the  Pentagon  show  there  were  60  military  deployments.  From  basically  1989  until  today,  there  have  been  343  deployments  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  60  in  the  preceding  period.  This  represents  over  a  500-percent  increase  in  our  deployments. These statistics tell the story.  I  am  not  suggesting  in  any  way  that  most  of  these  deployments  were  absolutely essential. Many were in the vital  security  interests of the United States.  As  I  think  quite  properly,  those  contending  for  the  Presidency  today,  both  Republican  and  Democrat,  have  pointed  out  that  they  will  watch  very  carefully  what  has  been  brought  to  the  attention,  largely  by  the  Congress  and  the  Chiefs,  that  they  are  overdeployed  and  underresourced.  Those  are  the  statistics of this period basically from 1989  until today.  While  the  rate  of  military  deployments  is  established  by  the  President,  the  Congress,  with  our  constitutional  powers,  is  continuing  to  support  the  Armed Forces by improving the quality  of  life  for  the  men  and  women  in  uniform  and  their  families,  and  the  President,  in  his  budget  submissions,  has  done  that.  But  each  time  in  the  past  3  years,  the Congress  has  gone  above  the  President\u2019s request to add what we can,  given  the  budget  constraints,  to  further  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  the  men  and  women  in  the  Armed  Forces,  to  further  increase  procurement,  to  further  increase O&M  funds because we  are  highly  aware  of  that  theme\u2014overdeployed and underresourced.  The  conference  report  takes  great  strides  in  the  direction  to  improve,  over  and  above  that  requested  by  the  President,  the  quality  of  life  of  our  men and women and, I may say, the retirees.  I  am  proud  of  our  committee.  The  Senate Armed Services Committee, the  records  show,  is  the  first  committee  in  the Senate to recognize the need for revising  the  health  care  program  for  career  military  retirees.  Basically,  that  is  20  years  or,  in  the  case  of  those  who  have  medical  retirement,  earlier  than  20,  but  the  career  military  have  long  been neglected.  I  want  to  credit  the  many  organizations  and  many  individuals  who  approached  this  chairman,  who  approached,  I  believe,  every  Member  of  the Senate, and brought to their attention  the  need  for  correction.  That  correction,  I  am  proud  to  say,  is  incorporated  in  this  conference  report  and  will be given in great detail.  Basically,  these  retirees,  in my  judgment,  have  been  entitled  to  this  for  many  years.  In  my  judgment,  they  were  promised  this.  At  a  later  point  in  this  debate,  I  will  go  into  the  specifics  because  I  have  researched  it way  back.  And  now,  at  long  last,  in  this  2001  appropriations,  we  make  the  start  for  a  health  care  program  to  have  the  care  for  those  retirees  which  they  deserve  and  to  which  they  have  been  entitled  for many years. One of the most important  single  items  in  this  conference  report is this military health care.  History  shows  that  our  military  retirees are the best recruiters of all. One  of  the  direct  consequences  of  our  military  being  overdeployed  and  underresourced\u2014I  will  use  that  refrain  over  and  over  again\u2014has  been  the  difficulty  in  recruiting  the  needed  personnel,  the  difficulty  in  retaining  the  middle  grade  officers  primarily,  and  the  middle  grade  enlisted,  particularly  those  with  skills  that  are  in  direct  competition  with  our  ever-burgeoning  economy  in  the  private  sector,  who  know  full  well  that  to  get  a  military  person\u2014trained  in  computers,  trained  in  electronics\u2014they  know  they  get  a  well-trained,  well-disciplined,  reliable  employee.  That  is  quite  a  lure  to  these  young  men  and  women  who  are  overdeployed,  who  suffer  so  much  family  separation.  There  has  been  an  over  500-percent  increase  in  these  military  deployments  in  the  past  decade  or  so. So  that  is  the  reason  we  are  having  difficulty  in  meeting our recruiting goals.  But  we  are  beginning  to  put  a  fix  in  to  take  care  of  the  retirees,  so  once  again  they  can  go  out,  as  they  have  done  in  the  past\u2014I  am  not  suggesting  they  withstood  recruiting,  but  certainly  some  of  the  incentive  has  been  lacking  because  they  have  not  been  treated  fairly\u2014and,  once  again,  they  will  be  in  the  forward  vanguard  of  recruiting.  They  are  the  best  recruiters  of all.  I  have  to  say  on  a  personal  note,  my  father served in World War I. I am very  proud  of  his  service  and  believe  he  recruited  me  in  World  War  II  by  simply  saying: It  is your duty, son. Although I  had  very modest  service  at  the  conclusion  of,  the  end  of  that  war,  fathers  like  him  all  throughout  the  country\u2014  and  some mothers\u2014were  the  recruiters  long  before  we  got  to  the  recruiting  station.  The conference report before the Senate  fulfills  an  important  commitment  of health care for life, as we have determined because  in World War  II, history  shows,  and  continuing  through  the  Korean war, and  indeed  through Vietnam,  the  goal  of  making  that  commitment  was  to  encourage  service  members  to  remain  in  uniform  and  become  careerists.  Simply  put,  there  was  the  commitment  of  health  care  for  life  in  exchange  for  their  dedicated  career  service.

I know he has been patient,  but  this  is  important.  It  will  be  put  in the RECORD.  I shall probably not  take more than 3 or 4 minutes.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President,  the  annual  Armed  Forces  bill  should  really  become almost an omnibus bill because  so  many  amendments  can  be  attached  under  the  rules  of  the  Senate,  which  I  support.  I  do  not  criticize  any  Member  exercising  his  or  her  rights  under  the  rules of the Senate to put on bills, subject  to  a  vote,  such  legislation  as  they  deem appropriate.  There  are  other  rules  that  preclude  that  in  certain  areas,  but  in  this  instance  we  had  a  freestanding,  amendable  piece  of  legislation  on  the  floor.  Senator KENNEDY courteously informed  me,  the  ranking  member,  and  others  that  he  was  going  to  raise  the  issue  of  what  is  generically  referred  to  as  the  hate  crimes  legislation. Senator HATCH  likewise  said  he  had  a  version  and  he  was  going  to  put  it  before  the  Senate.  Both  Senators  brought  those  bills.  Both  bills  passed.  Both  bills  went  to  conference  as  a  part  of  the  Senate  bill.  My  decision,  as  chairman  of  the  conference,  was made  to  drop  those  pieces  of  legislation\u2014both  of  them;  Senator  bill,  Senator  HATCH\u2019s  bill\u2014  because  I  looked upon  it as my duty  to  get  this  bill  passed  and  enacted  into  law.  That  is  my  principal  responsibility  as  chairman  of  the  Armed  Services  Committee,  working  with  my  ranking member  and  other members  of  the committee.  I  have  been  here  22  years.  I  understand  Senators  quite  well.  I  respect  their  rights,  and  I  know  when  they  speak with sincerity. I was advised, not  by  one,  not  by  two,  but  by  many  Senators  on  both  sides  of  this  issue,  of  the  gravity of the issue and the seriousness  of  the  issue.  It  was  made  clear  to  me  that  if  this  legislation\u2014either  Senator  bill  or  Senator  HATCH\u2019s  bill\u2014were left in the conference report,  in all likelihood we would have a series  of  filibusters. And  given  the  very  short  period  of  time  which  is  remaining  in  this session\u2014even though we have been  active  as  a  committee  and  got  the  bill  timely  to  the  Senate;  even  though  we  were  on  the  floor  for  weeks  intermittently, having to have it laid aside\u2014we  are  here  in  the  final  hours  of  this  session  of  this  Congress.  If  we  do  not  act  on  this  bill  tonight,  and  if  we  do  not  pass this bill tonight, it is questionable  whether  the  leadership  will  find  additional  time  for  consideration.  And,  as  we  say,  it  may  be  that  pieces  of  it  would  be  put  into  some  appropriations  bills  or  a  CR  or  something\u2014some  parts\u2014but  much  of  it  could  well  be  lost,  unless  this  conference  report  is  enacted. So  I made  the decision.  I  take  full  responsibility  for  the  decision  of  urging  the  conferees  to  drop  this  legislation.  My  distinguished  colleague,  the  ranking  member  of  the  committee,  I  KENNEDY\u2019s  Senpresume,  will  address  the  Senate  in  a  moment  on  this  point.  Exercising  his  rights  in  a  very  courteous way,  he  said  he  wished  for  me  to  convene  the  full  Committee  on  Armed  Services  and  have  a  vote:  That  we  did.  By  a  narrow  margin,  my  recommendation  was  sustained  by  the  full  committee,  I  might  add,  in  a  bipartisan  exchange  of  votes.  So  that  is  the  history  as  to  why  this  legislation  was  dropped,  I  say  to  my  colleague  from  Minnesota.  I  take  responsibility. I believed it was necessary  that  this  bill  should  be  passed.  On  this  day  when  the  world  is  in  such  a  tragic  situation,  whether  it  is  the  violence  in  the  Middle  East  or  the  attack  on  an  American  ship,  all  of  America  expects  Congress to do its duty on behalf of the  men  and  women  of  the  Armed  Forces,  and this  is the most  important piece of  legislation done every year.  So  I  do  not  regret  for  a  minute  the  decision  I  had  to  make  in  the  face  of  representations,  fairly  and  honestly  made  to  me,  by  colleagues  on  both  sides,  as  to  the  tactics  that  would  be  used  if  this  bill would  be  brought up  in  a  conference  report  before  the  Senate  with  either  pieces  of  that  legislation  contained in the bill.  I yield the floor.  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Michigan.  Mr.  LEVIN.  Mr.  President,  first,  on  the  hate  crimes  legislation  issue,  my  good  friend  from  Virginia  has  accurately  presented  the  facts.  There  are  some  additional  facts,  though,  which  should also be brought to bear.  I  can\u2019t  remember  a  time,  although  there  may  have  been  one,  when  the  Senate has adopted language, as we did  by  a  vote  of  57\u201342,  and  when  the  House  of  Representatives  has  adopted  language,  as  they  did  by  30  or  40  votes\u2014  when  I  say  \u2018\u2018adopted  language\u2019\u2019  in  the  House,  let me  be  clear, what  the House  of  Representatives  did  was  even  more  precise than adopt the hate crimes language;  they  instructed  their  conferees  to  agree  to  our  hate  crimes  language  by  30  or  40  votes\u2014I  cannot  remember  a  time  when  one  body  has  adopted  language  and  the  other  body  has  instructed  their  conferees  to  yield  to  the  first  body\u2019s  language  where  that  language  has  then  been  dropped  in  conference.  I  am  not  saying  that  has  never  happened  because  I  haven\u2019t  checked  the  records to be sure. I can say I can never  remember  it  happening.  Think  about  it.  We  had  a  big  debate  on  this  issue.  We  adopted  Senator  hate  crimes  language  by  a  vote  of  57\u201342  in  this  body.  Then  the  House  had  a  debate,  instructing  their  conferees  to  agree  to our  language, and  somehow or  other it is dropped in conference.  Let  it  be  clear  as  to  what  happened.  The  House  conferees  would  not  accept  our  language,  despite  the  instruction  from  the  House  of  Representatives.  Then  we  were  faced  with  the  question,  Do we  then  give  it  up,  despite  the  vote  in the Senate?  KENNEDY\u2019s  There  was  a  vote  among  Senate  conferees. Ten Republicans  and  one Democrat  voted  basically  to  give  it  up,  which  was  the  11-vote  majority.  Eight  Democrats  and  one  Republican  voted  not  to  give  it  up;  let  us  maintain  this  fight;  let  us  bring  this  language  back  in  the  conference  report.  If  someone  wants  to  filibuster a conference  report,  they  have  that  right.  But  this  legislation  is  too  important.  This  is  the  hate  crimes bill that this body adopted. It is  simply  too  important  a  subject  to  be  dropped  because  of  the  threat  of  a  filibuster  after  being  adopted  in  the  Senate  and  having  the  House  telling  their  folks  to  yield  to  us.  If  we  refused  to  adopt  important  legislation  around  here  whenever  there  was  the  threat  of  a  filibuster, we would never  adopt  anything  important. The  civil  rights  legislation  of  the  1960s  was  adopted  after  weeks of debate, a filibuster that lasted  weeks,  with  numerous  cloture  votes,  because it was important legislation.  Let me  say  this  about  our  chairman:  He  is  absolutely  correct  that  he  felt  that his responsibility was such that he  had  to  bring  a  bill  to  the  floor.  He  made  the  judgment,  as  he  indicated,  and  it  was  a  good  faith  judgment.  I  may disagree with him, which I do, but  I  don\u2019t  in  any  way  disagree  with  the  fact  that  the  chairman  made  a  good  faith judgment that it was necessary to  drop  this  language  because  the  House  would not accept  it. And  even  though  I  disagree  with  it  and  think  we  should  have  put  this  language  in  here  and  let  someone  filibuster,  nonetheless,  I  surely  agree  that  as  always  he  acts  in  the  best of faith.  Mr.  WARNER.  Mr.  President,  may  I  express  to my  colleague my  respect  for  his  acknowledging  the  fact  that  my  judgment  was  predicated  on  sound  facts.  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President,  the  Senator  from  Virginia  was  gracious  enough  to  say  I  may  want  to  respond.  Other  colleagues  want  to  speak,  and  I  believe  the  exchange  between  my  two  colleagues  covered  the  ground  and  spoke  to  the  question  I  raised.  If  I  had  spoken, I would have said what Senator  said.  I  just wouldn\u2019t  have  said  it  as well.  I  appreciate  the  forthrightness  of  the  Senator  from  Virginia,  his  directness  and,  as  always,  his  intellectual honesty.  Mr. WARNER.  I  thank my  colleague.  I  only  say  to  him,  the  fervor  with  which  he  addresses  issues  and  pursues  his  goals  in  the  Senate  for  this  cause,  be  it  hate  crimes  in  favor,  I  think  he  will  recognize  that  that  same  fervor  is  matched by others who have a different  point  of  view  very  often.  Therein  lies  the  issue which  I  had  to  take  responsibility  to  resolve,  and  this  bill  was  of  paramount  interest  to  anything  else  before the Senate.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Michigan.  Mr.  LEVIN.  Mr.  President,  I  apologize to my good friend from Minnesota.  I assumed he had yielded the  floor. Has  the Senator yielded?

            "166": "October 12, 2000  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE S10355  There  have  been  no  nuclear  weapons  at  the  Iowa  site  since  1975,  but  it  is  well  known  that  weapons  were  there  before  that. The DOE  says  the weapons  were  there. A  promotional  video  of  the  Army  contractor  at  the  site  even  says  the  weapons  were  there.  But  the  Army  can\u2019t say it.  What  this  does  is,  it  send  the  wrong  signal  to  the  former  workers.  These  workers  swore  oaths  never  to  reveal  what  they  did  at  the  plant.  And  many  of  them  are  still  reluctant  to  talk.  They  are  worried  that  their  cancers  or  other  health  problems  may  be  caused  by  their  work  at  the  plant.  But  they  feel that they can\u2019t even tell their doctors  or  site  cleanup  crews  they  worked  there  or  what  the  tasks  were  they  did.  They don\u2019t want to violate the oaths of  secrecy  they  took.  One  worker  at  the  Iowa  plant  said  recently:  There\u2019s  still  stuff  buried  out  there  that  we  don\u2019t  know  where  it  is.  And  we  know  people  who  do  know,  but  they  will  not  say  anything  yet  because  they  are  still  afraid of repercussions. Instead of helping  these workers  speak  out,  the Army  has forced them to keep their silence.  I  am  pleased  that  the  conference  report  includes  a  provision  I  offered  to  help  these  workers.  It  is  narrowly  targeted  to  require  the  Defense  Department,  in  consultation  with  the  Energy  Department,  to  review  their  classification  and  security  policies  to  ensure  they  do  not  prevent  or  discourage  workers  at  nuclear  weapons  facilities  from discussing possible exposures with  their  health  care  providers  and  other  appropriate  officials.  The  provision  specifically  recognizes  that  this  must  be  done  within  national  security  constraints. It also directs the Department  to  contact  people  who  may  have  been  exposed  to  radioactive  or  hazardous  substances  at  former  Defense  Department  nuclear  weapons  facilities,  including  the  Iowa  plant.  The  Department  is  to  notify  them  of  any  exposures  and  of  how  they  can  discuss  the  exposures  with  their  health  care  providers  and  other  appropriate  officials  without  violating  security  or  classification procedures.  I  thank  the  chairman  and  the  ranking  member  of  the  conference  committee  for  joining  with  me  in  a  colloquy  to  clarify  that  this  provision  applies  to  all  workers  at  such  facilities,  and not just DOD personnel.  I  am  pleased we  are  passing  this  provision  today.  I  thank  the  managers  of  the bill for including this provision and  for the  fine work  they have done on all  aspects of this bill.  Lastly,  I  am  very  concerned  about  the  recent  upsurge  of  violence  in  the  Middle  East.  I  strongly  support  the  efforts  of  President  Clinton  and  U.N.  Secretary General Kofi Annan  to  negotiate a cease-fire. This cycle of killings  and  destruction  must  end  so  there  can  be  a  return  to  the  negotiating  table  to  achieve  a  comprehensive  and  lasting  peace agreement in the Middle East.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Michigan.  SenBYRD HARKIN HARKIN RECORD.  Mr.  LEVIN.  Mr.  President,  I  thank  Senator HARKIN for  his wonderful  commitment  to  the  workers,  particularly  in  his  State,  but  really  the  workers  in  America.  He  noticed  something  in  our  bill  which  inadvertently  could  have  left  out  some  workers  we  wanted  to  cover and he wanted to cover.  We  worked  out  the  colloquy  with  Senator  which  will  be  made  a  part  of  the  I  thank  Senator  for his  intrepid effort on behalf  of  the workers  of America  and  Iowa.  It  has really paid off.  Mr.  WARNER.  Mr.  President,  I  join  my  colleague.  The  three  of  us  signed  the  colloquy.  I  thank  the  Senator.  He  does look after his people.  Mr.  HARKIN.  If  I  might  reciprocate,  I  thank  the  chairman  and  Senator  LEVIN, the ranking member, for including  this  in  the  bill.  These  were  hard  workers.  They  were  good  people.  They  work  for  a  contract  employer,  not  the  Department  of  Defense.  With  this  change,  it makes  it  clear  they  are  covered also. I thank them both.  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.  While I have the floor, Mr. President,  I  would  like  to  advise  Senators  that  there is an effort being made to try and  get  the  vote  on  first,  presumably,  a  point  of  order  that  will  be  raised  and  then,  following  that,  on  final  passage.  We  hope  to  begin  to  move  to  those  votes  possibly  as  early  as  6  o\u2019clock.  So  we  are  condensing  down  the  period  of  time  prior  to  the  vote  that  Senators  wish to speak.  Of  course,  we  can  arrange  for  such  time after the votes as Senators desire.  This  is  to  accommodate  both  sides  of  the  aisle  and  many  Senators.  I  thank  my  colleagues  for  working  with  me  to  achieve  these  goals.  We  now  have  in  place  two  Senators  ready  to  speak,  then  I will consult with our  leadership.  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator  from Virginia will yield  for an additional  minute,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  Senator  be  recognized  immediately  after  Senator  for up to 5 minutes, and then that Senator  be  recognized  immediately  after  Senator  I  will  talk  to  Senator BYRD about  the  time  situation  in which we find ourselves.  Mr.  WARNER.  Senator  is  a  member of our committee and he has a  key  piece  of  legislation  in  here.  It  is  my  hope  that  we  can  have  Senators  speak  briefly  so  that  we  can  get  on  to  the issue by Senator KERREY.  Mr. LEVIN. I will speak with Senator  about the amount of time.  Mr.  WARNER.  And  Senator  ROBB,  our  valued  colleague,  a  member  of  the  committee,  is  about  to  address  his  issues.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Virginia is recognized.  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the defense  authorization  bill  before  us  today  has  historic qualities. It represents another  year of real growth in our commitment  to national defense and the readiness of  the men and women who  serve this Nation  in  uniform.  It  represents  our  reinALLARD BYRD ALLARD.  ROBB  BYRD Senvigorated  and  growing  national  consensus  on  the  importance  of  American  military power, and our military\u2019s continuing  relevance  to  world  peace,  stability,  and  prosperity.  Friends  and  allies  around  the  world  will  see  in  this  bill  America\u2019s  commitment  to  leadership  and  our  willingness  to  keep  our  military  the  most  powerful  ever  and  equal to the challenge.  This  bill  continues  to  chip  away  at  the  quality  of  life  issues  that  make  service  in  today\u2019s  military  a  greater  sacrifice  than  it  needs  to  be.  This  bill  raises  pay,  improves  housing,  authorizes  additional  bonuses  to  improve  retention,  and  improves medical  care  for  servicemembers and their families.  I am particularly proud  that  this bill  at  last  acknowledges  the  promise  of  lifetime health care made to America\u2019s  thousands  of  military  retirees  and  their  families.  The  program  put  in  place  by  this  bill  sets  the  conditions  for keeping  our  promise,  but we  should  have  no  illusion  that  this  fulfills  our  debt.  The  devil,  as  usual,  is  in  the  details and  there  is much work ahead  ensuring  that  the  system  we  create  is  up  to  the  requirements  of  this  benefit  and  accomplishes  its  purpose.  In  a  respect  our  real  work  lies  before  us,  now  that  we are over the political and budgetary  hurdles of keeping the promise.  This  bill,  thankfully  but  modestly,  also  increases  our  procurement,  readiness, and research and development accounts.  Anyone  reading  this  bill  will  see  our  clear  intent  to  deal  with  our  daunting maintenance challenges. Anyone  reading  this  bill  will  see  our  clear  intent  to  modernize  our  tactical  aircraft.  Anyone  reading  this  bill  will  see  our  clear  intent  to  increase  shipbuilding  rates  necessary  to  sustain  a  globally  capable  300-ship Navy. Anyone  reading  this  bill  will  see  our  clear  intent  to  accelerate  research  and  development  to  bring  forward  the  next  generation  of  aircraft\u2014manned  and  unmanned,  ships,  and  combat  vehicles  necessary  to  our  future  readiness  and  security.  Unfortunately,  the  rush,  early  this  year,  to  massive  tax  cuts  and  political  fears over new spending worked against  us  in making  the kinds  of  real  and  significant  increases  necessary  to  address  the  challenges  to  our  readiness  today  and tomorrow.  There  is no doubt  that significant  increases  in  the  defense  top  line  are  ahead. But regrettably, we have missed  an  opportunity  to  apply  additional  resources  this  year  to  some  of  our  more  chronic  military  requirements  such  as  aviation  spare  parts  and  ship  depot  maintenance.  Equally  regrettable,  we  fail  again,  my  judgement,  to  take  on  the  issue  excess infrastructure.  One of  the best ways we can help pay  for  current  readiness  is  through  reducing  the  DOD\u2019s  large  \u2018\u2018tail\u2019\u2019  of  infrastructure  and  support,  which  is  taking  away  critical  funding  for  the  teeth\u2014  in  of  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:15 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00081 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S12OC0.REC S12OC0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",

I  know  how  difficult  it  was  for  him  to  work  through  the  complicated  case  which was recently disposed of.  I worked with the Senator in the creation  of  this  new  entity  in  the  Department  of  Energy.  I  am  about  to  get  some  new  documents. Once  I  get  them,  I  want  to  show  them  to  you  and  we  may  find  a  little  time  to  amplify  this  record. But I am advised, subject to the  documents  coming,  we  did  take  into  consideration the concerns the Senator  has  expressed,  and  we  do  have  a  letter  from  the  individual  primarily  responsible  for  security  saying  they  could  work with this proposal,  this  language.  Until  I  get  that  letter,  I  will  withhold.  But  I  may  ask  unanimous  consent  to  have  documents  printed  in  the  should  I  get  them  in  my  possession, after showing them to my good  friend  and  colleague,  the  Senator  from  New Mexico.  Mr.  LOTT.  I  know  the  Senator  from  Georgia  is  prepared  to  speak.  Will  he  allow me  to  intervene  for  a moment?  I  do  not  want  to  take  away  from  time  that may  be  reserved,  so  I yield myself  such  time  from  my  leader  time  as  is  necessary.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  objection, it is so ordered.  Mr.  LOTT.  Mr.  President,  I  will  be  brief. I want to commend Senator WARfor  the  effort  he  and  his  staff  have  put  into  this  bill.  I  am  hoping  we  can  wrap up the debate and get to the votes  that  are  going  to  be  required  on  the  point  of  order  and  final  passage  before  too late in the evening.  This  has  been  a  long  time  coming.  It  has  been  a  laborious  process.  Senator  stuck  with  it.  Obviously,  he  had  help  from  his  colleague  on  the  other  side  of  the  Capitol,  the  gentleman  from South Carolina, Congressman  He  worked  with  Senator  LEVIN, the ranking member. But this is  a monumental achievement.  There  are  some  people  who  have  the  idea  we  do  not  need  the  Defense  authorization bill if we have already done  the  Department  of  Defense  appropriations bill and military construction appropriations  bill,  but  we  need  this  bill  because  it  authorizes  important  programs; it authorizes important changes  in  the  law;  it  authorizes  the  money  that we  need.  I want  to  touch  on  a  few  of those very briefly.  The  funding  level  for  new  budget  authority  for  the  Department  of  Defense  in this bill is $309.9 billion, which is $4.6  billion above the President\u2019s budget request.  It  is  an  increase  over  what  was  requested  for  procurement,  for  research,  development,  test  and  evaluation,  and  operations  and  maintenance.  It  also  has  a  3.7-percent  pay  raise  for  our  military  personnel  effective  January 1, 2001.  Last  year,  when  we  had  a  pay  raise  for  our  military  men  and  women,  the  word  I  got  from  the  rank-and-file  troops,  and  also  from  the  Joint  Chiefs,  including  specifically  the  Chairman  of  WARNER SPENCE.  the Joint Chiefs, was that it absolutely  transformed  the  attitude  of  our  military men  and women who were  leaving  and  were  not  \u2018\u2018reuping,\u2019\u2019  as  the  saying  goes in the military, because they really wondered if we appreciated them and  knew  they  were  there.  At  least  by  improving  their  pay,  by  dealing  with  their  retirement  benefits,  and  now  in  this bill, another pay raise, and dealing  with  this  question  of  health  care,  it  is  going  to  have  a  good  effect  on  morale.  Obviously,  we  want  the  morale  to  be  good.  We  want  quality  of  life  in  the  barracks. We  want  the  ships  and  tanks  and  everything  we  need.  But  if  we  do  not  begin  with  decent  living  arrangements  for  our  military  men  and  women, then all is lost.  This  bill  comes  at  a  critical  time.  Just  today  we  see  what  the  risks  are\u2014  the  U.S.S.  Cole,  built  in  my  hometown  of  Pascagoula\u2014I  believe  I  was  there  when  it  was  commissioned\u2014300  sailors  on  the  ship,  and  now  we  see  3  dozen  or  more  of  them  are  killed  or  injured  and  others  are  missing.  Yet  this  is  one  of  the  most  sophisticated  ships  in  the  world.  But  it  shows  once  again,  if  we  have  kamikazes who  are willing  to  put  it  all  on  the  line,  to  get  killed,  to  do  damage,  they  can  do  damage  to  our  equipment  and  to  our men  and women.  This  is  no  time  to  nitpick  this  bill  and  turn away from it.  There  are  those  who  say  we  should  not  be  starting  these  new  programs  or  make  them  permanent.  But  for  our  military  men  and  women,  active  duty  and  retirees,  and  for  their  families,  we  need  to  address  this  health  care  question.  For  our  military  people  to  be  told,  at  65,  you  are  off,  you  are  off  this  program,  go  there  and  get  on Medicare  or  find  some  other  arrangement,  is  wrong. When we  talked  to our military  personnel  and  our  retirees  and we  said:  what  is  really  the  thing  that  you  want  the most  in helping you deal with your  health  care  needs,  they  cited  the  pharmaceutical  problem,  the  need  for  pharmacy  benefits,  either  mail  order  or,  in  this bill, through retail.  This  is  a  major  achievement.  I  have  already  had  military  retirees  and  veterans  call  my  office  literally  in  tears  to  say  thanks  for  what  we  are  doing  here.  Maybe  it  was  not  done  exactly  the  prettiest  way,  or  in  the  way  it  should  have  been  done  early  on,  but  this  is  a  major  achievement.  I  do  not  want  to  be  the  one  to  explain  to  some  veteran,  because  of  a  procedural  issue  or  a  point  of  order,  that  we  don\u2019t  address this need of our military men and  women and their families and our retirees.  I  am  not  going  to  explain  that.  I  am going to vote  for this bill, and I am  going to do it proudly.  Then  there  is  another  provision  that  objections  have  been  raised  about,  and  that  is  the  Department  of  Energy  employees  who  were  injured  due  to  exposure to radiation and other problems at  our  DOE  facilities  and  nuclear  facilities. Again,  there may need  to  be more  work  on  it.  Maybe  it  should  have  been  handled  in  a  different  way.  But  who  Senwants  to  tell  these  people  who  have  been  injured  by  our  Government  operation,  \u2018\u2018There  is  no  program  for  you.\u2019\u2019  Not me.  I  do  not  think we  should walk  away from this at this point.  This  is  a  reasonable  compromise.  Both  the  retirement  and  the  DOE  program  that was added as we went along,  and  expanded,  while  it  may  present  certain difficulties  for some of our people,  in  the  end  it  is  the  right  thing  to  do. Also, it is attached to a bill that we  need  desperately\u2014a  good  bill,  a  bill  that has been a long time coming.  I  thank  all  those  involved.  There  are  so many parts of it I could refer to that  are  important,  but  I  didn\u2019t  want  us  to  get  to  final  passage  without me  saying  we  should  do  this  bill\u2014we  should  defeat  the  point  of  order,  and  we  should  pass  this  bill.  It  is  the  right  thing  for  the defense of our  country,  for our veterans,  and  the  right  thing  for  people  who  have  been  injured  and  haven\u2019t  been  properly  compensated.  We  can  fine tune the program as we learn more  about  the  extent  of  the  damages  and  how  much  they  are  injured  and  the  proper way  to deal with  it, but  for now  I  urge my  colleagues,  vote  for  this  legislation.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Virginia.  Mr.  WARNER.  Mr.  President,  I  commend  our  distinguished  majority  leader.  This  bill  had  a  long  and  tortuous  course  through  the  Senate,  but  he  stood  by  our  side,  not  only  me,  as  chairman, but the members of the committee from both sides of the aisle, and  the Democratic leader likewise.  I  see  the  presence  of  the  distinguished Senator from Nevada. On those  days when we were on again and off the  next, you stood by. Last year, you were  the  first  one  to  cosponsor  the  bill  on  the pay  raise,  the  first one  this year  to  cosponsor  the bill on  the medical benefits. While you are no  longer a member  of  our  committee,  having  once  been  one, you have stood with us throughout  this whole process. I thank you.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Georgia is recognized.  Mr.  WARNER.  I  inquire  how  much  time  our  distinguished  colleague  and  very  valuable  member  of  the  committee, without whose wit and function  I doubt we could function, requires.  Mr.  CLELAND.  I  thank  the  Senator.  Two minutes.  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come  before  the  Senate  to  remind  Members  that the news today reminds us why we  need  a  Defense  authorization  bill;  why  we  need  pay  increases  for  our  military  men  and  women  abroad;  why  we  need  our Armed Forces to be strong; why we  need  to  take care of our military  retirees,  especially  in  terms  of  their  health  care  needs;  why  we  need  a  defense  of  this country at all.  Our young men and women are  in  121  nations  around  the  globe,  and  they  stand on watch  in defense of  this  country.  In  doing  so,  they  voluntarily,  every  one  of  them,  place  themselves  in  SenVerDate Mar 15 2010  23:15 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00089 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S12OC0.REC S12OC0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",
            "182": "October 12, 2000  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE S10371  made  everybody  join  Medicare,  including men and women in the Armed Services.  This  problem  came  about  because  people  who  retired  from  the  service  qualified  for  two  medical  programs:  One,  by  paying  Medicare  taxes;  and  two,  by  serving  20  or  more  years.  The  military  health  care  benefit  was  a  right  not  to  Medigap  insurance  or  any  of  the  things  we  are  talking  about  today,  it  was  a  right  to  go  to  a  military hospital on a space-available basis  and get military medicine.  What  happened\u2014which  was  terribly  wrong,  in  my  opinion\u2014is  that,  in  the  midst of a period of very tight budgets,  the  military  gave  retirees  their  military health benefit until they turned 65  when  they  became  qualified  for  Medicare.  As  they  got  close  to  their  65th  birthday\u2014I  know  this  because  I  have  a  brother  who  is  a  career  soldier.  I  don\u2019t  know  whether  he  likes  military  medicine  because  they  know  his  name\u2014  \u2018\u2018Colonel.\u2019\u2019  He  goes  to  a  regular  hospital  and  they  call  him  \u2018\u2018Mister\u2019\u2019  although,  obviously,  they  don\u2019t  know  who  he  is.  They  don\u2019t  know  anything  about  him.  So  I  don\u2019t  know  whether  it  is  that  or  whether  he  just  is  comfortable  with  having  been  a  career  soldier  and having  served  in  the Army  for  some  27  years\u2014the  point  is,  as  he  gets  closer  to  65,  under  the  current  system  he will get a sheet when he goes in, and  members of the staff know this, he will  get  a  referral  sheet. And  they will  say,  \u2018\u2018Colonel,  you  are  going  to  turn  65  in  August. So  these  are  the medical  areas  that  we  are  aware  of  that  are  relevant  to  you,  and  these  are  private  practitioners  in  Dallas,  Texas,  that  you  can  go to under Medicare.\u2019\u2019  Here  is  a  person  who  got  military  medicine  on  active  duty  for  27  years,  and  then  he  retired  and  continued  to  get  it  up  to  the  day  he  was  65,  but  because  he  earned  two  benefits,  they  shoved  him  out  the  door  when  he  turned 65.  My  disagreement  with  Senator  WARis not about that recruiting poster.  I  believe  that  poster  is  true.  And  I  believe  the  benefit  is  owed.  Where  we  split  company  is  on  what  we  are  doing  here tonight.  Let me  explain. Just  to  complete  the  history,  because  I  felt  that  I  had  some  personal  knowledge  about  this  problem,  I  was  the  leader  in  Congress  in  putting  together  a  test  program  called  Medicare  Subvention.  The  idea  was  simple.  A  lot  of  simple  ideas  don\u2019t  work.  It  is  not  clear  how  well  this  one  is  working.  In  some  ways,  I  think  it  is  working  well  although  costs  are  up  because  utilization  is  up.  But  the  basic  idea  was  simple.  Let\u2019s  pick  ten  facilities  in  America  that  have  big  retirement  populations  near  them  and  let  people  stay  in  military  medicine  and  let  Medicare  pay  what  they  would  pay  had they gone to the private sector. We  are  in  the  midst  of  a  test  of  that  program right now.  Earlier  this  year,  while  Medicare  Subvention  was  still  being  tested,  this  bill  came  up,  and  while  we  were  debatNER WARNER  WARNER\u2019s  supported  rest  of  us  Senator  DOMENICI KERREY ator DOMENICI ing military  retiree  health  care,  a  proposal  was  made  to  spend  $92  billion.  Senator  will  remember  that.  That  proposal  failed.  And  it  should  have. I voted against it.  During  that  debate,  Senator  offered  a  2-year  program  to  build  on  the test that we had underway. Senator  program  cost  $466  million.  I  it.  In  fact,  I  think  all  the  supported  it.  I  am  not  sure  did,  but  I  think  Sensupported it.  The  Senate  had  put  in  the  budget  enough  money  that  to  try  Senator  WARNER\u2019s program out for 2 years. Why  was  it  important  to  do  it  in  2  years?  I  will  talk  about  the  money,  but  let  me  talk  about  the  policy.  What  is  wrong  with committing to $60 billion worth of  new programs  that have never been debated,  never  been  tested,  and  committing  to  a  $200  billion  liability  over  the  next 70 years? What is wrong is, as anybody  who  has  ever  served  in  public  office  knows,  once  this  program  is  in  place,  a  vested  political  interest  will  build  up  around  it  in  the  medical  sector,  in  the  retirement  sector,  and  in  the  communities  where  it  is  provided.  What  happens  is  even  if  this  program  doesn\u2019t work, even  if  it  is terribly  inefficient, even if people are unhappy with  it,  the  chances  of  ever  getting  rid  of  it  or  fundamentally  changing  it  are  very  low.  We  have  in  Medicare,  as  Senator  KERREY, better than anyone else knows  having  served  on  the  Medicare  Commission,  we  have  a  1965  medical  care  system.  In  Medicare,  we  have  an  old  Edsel. Yet we  can\u2019t  change  it. We  tried  to  change  it  on  the  Medicare  Commission  as  the  Senator  remembers.  But  the vested interest in it, even though it  is  inefficient,  even  though  it  doesn\u2019t  serve  the  public  well,  even  though  it  costs  tremendous  amounts  of  money,  once it is in place, it is hard to change.  Here  is  the  point.  The  first  problem  with  this  huge  program  is  that  was  never debated, never discussed, and was  written  by  a  handful  of  people  that,  quite  frankly,  are  very  intelligent  people,  very  knowledgeable  people  about  defense.  As  far  as  I  am  aware,  it  was  never  discussed  in  the  Finance  Committee,  which  has  jurisdiction  over  Medicare.  It  was  never  debated  in  any  public  forum.  It  has  never  been  tested  anywhere.  The  point  is,  tonight  on  the  verge  of  adjournment,  we  are  getting  ready to commit $60 billion in spending  on  a  program  that  may  or  may  not  work,  may  or  may  not  satisfy  people,  and which  is  going  to  be  virtually  irreversible.  The  second  point  I  want  to  make  is  the  House  went  into  conference  with  a  program  that  extended  the  Medicare  Subvention  demonstration,  made  it  permanent  within  6  years,  and  costs  $945  million.  So  the  Senate  went  to  conference  with  a  temporary  program  of  $466  million  to  build  on  a  concept,  that  basically,  we  had  started  in  the  test;  and  the  other  House  of  Congress  went with a program that made a judgment  to move  toward  full  implementation  of  the  test,  and  it  cost  $945  million. But what happened?  What happened\u2014and Senator KERREY  was  making  the  point,  I  thought  very  effectively\u2014they  got  to  conference  and  suddenly  somebody  said,  \u2018\u2018The  sky\u2019s  the limit. We have a huge surplus. This  is an  election year.\u2019\u2019 So what happened  is  one  House,  with  a  program  for  $466  million,  and  the  other  House,  with  a  program  for  $945  million,  got  together  and suddenly we have a $60 billion entitlement  program.  Actually  the  new  program  is  $39  billion,  but  the  committee  just  gratuitously  took  existing  health care programs and said let\u2019s just  put  $21  billion  on  automatic  pilot  in  a  permanent  entitlement  program  so  we  do  not  have  to  account  for  spending  it.  That  is  what  happened.  Why  did  it  happen? Because the  surplus  is burning  a  hole  in  our  pocket.  This  surplus  is  the greatest danger we  face  in terms of  our  economic  stability\u2014not  just  now,  but  10  or  12  years  from  now  when  the  baby  boomers  start  to  retire.  It  is  not  just  happening  here.  I  am  not  just  being  mean  to  our  dear  friends  on  the  Armed  Services  Committee,  a  committee  I  had  the  privilege  to  serve  on  for 6 years. It is happening everywhere.  We  have  a  railroad  retirement  proposal  that  lowers  the  retirement  age.  We  are  raising  the  retirement  age  in  Social Security. Yet, we would lower it  in  railroad  retirement.  We  have  a  proposal to give Amtrak $10 billion.  We  have  proposals\u2014we  are  giving  back  Medicare  savings  that  we  have  previously  adopted  at  a  rate  where,  in  10  years, we will  have  given  back more  than  we  ever  had  in  savings,  yet Medicare  is  going  broke  every  day.  What  is  happening  to  us? What  is  happening  to  us  is  this  surplus  is  affecting  our  judgment  and  we  are  spending  it  as  fast  as  we can spend it.  Let  me  sum  up.  I  want  to  make  a  point about the economy, one I had not  thought  of  until  I  was  talking  to  Alan  Greenspan today, and I want to bring it  up because I think it is relevant.  What  is  my  position?  My  position  is  we  do  have  an  obligation  to  military  retirees  and  we  have  to  find  a  way  to  fix  the  health  care  system  for military  retirees. But I think we need to do it so  we  know  what  we  are  doing,  so  we  know  what  it  costs,  so  we  know  it  is  going to be efficient, and we have to do  it  after  there  has  been  a  clear,  effective,  public  debate  and  where  we  have  actually  tested  the  program  so  we  know what we are doing.  The  problem  here  is  this  bill  is  immensely  popular,  as  my  colleagues  know  if  any  of  you  have  paid  any  attention  to  your  telephone  calls  today,  but  it  is  popular  because we  are  spending massive amounts of money.  My  point  is  I  do  not  disagree  with  Senator  We  owe  these  benefits,  and  we  are  going  to  have  to  provide  a  way  for  our  military  retirees  to  have  quality  medical  care,  which  we  promised.  But  the  idea  of  doing  it  by  busting  the budget by  $59.9 billion on a  WARNER.

            "190": "October 12, 2000  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE S10379  report  should  not  be  interpreted  as  a  lack of support for our men and women  in  uniform. Rather, what  I  cannot  support  is  the  cold  war  mentality  that  continues  to  permeate  the  United  States defense establishment.  I  strongly  support  our  Armed  Forces  and  the  excellent  work  they  are  doing  to  combat  the  new  threats  of  the  21st  century  and  beyond.  However,  I  am  concerned  that  we  are  not  giving  our  forces  the  tools  they  need  to  combat  these  emerging  threats.  Instead,  this  conference  report,  like  the  corresponding  defense  appropriations  bill  that  has  already  been  enacted,  clings  to  the  strategies  and  weapons  that  we  used to fight\u2014and win\u2014the cold war.  The  cold  war  is  over.  It  is  past  time  that we undertake  a  comprehensive  review of the threats currently facing the  United States and formulate a strategy  on  how  best  to  combat  them  before  we  continue  to  commit  billions  of  dollars  to  programs  that  were  created  to  fight  an enemy that no longer exists.  As  we  reexamine  our  defense  priorities,  we  should  assess  the  changing  roles  and  missions  of  both  our  active  duty  and  our  reserve  components.  The  National  Guard  and  Reserve  are  integral  parts  of  overseas  missions,  with  recent  and  ongoing  missions  in  places  including  Iraq  and  the  Balkans.  According  to  statements  by  Department  of  Defense  officials,  Guardsmen  and  Reservists  will  continue  to  play  an  increasingly  important  role  in  our  national  defense  strategy  as  they  are  called  upon  to  shoulder  more  of  the  burden  of  military  operations  both  at  home  and  abroad.  The  National  Guard  and  Reserves  deserve  the  full  support  they need to carry out their duties.  One  crucial  part  of  that  support  is  providing  adequate  compensation  to  these  dedicated  men  and  women.  I  am  pleased  that  this  conference  report  includes  a modified  version  of  an  amendment  I  offered  during  Senate  consideration  of  this  bill  which  authorizes  special  duty  assignment  pay  for  members  of  the  National  Guard  and  Reserve  not  on active duty. This provision will provide  a  measure  of  pay  equity  to  National  Guard  and  Reserve  personnel  by  making  them  eligible  for  special  duty  assignment  pay  for  special  duties  performed during drill periods.  The men and women who serve in the  Guard and Reserves are cornerstones of  our  national  defense  and  domestic  infrastructure,  and  they  deserve  to  be  adequately  and  equitably  compensated  for their dedicated service to this country.  This  provision  is  a  step  in  that  direction.  I  thank  the  chairman  and  the  ranking  member  of  the  Committee  on  Armed  Services  for  their  cooperation  and support on this important issue.  On  another  matter,  I  am  also  delighted  that  this  bill  permanently  extends  the  authority  of  the  General  Services  Administration,  GSA,  to  convey  surplus  property  to  local  governments  for  law  enforcement  purposes.  This provision builds on an amendment  I  offered when  this measure was  before  the  Senate,  and  I  am  pleased  that  the  conferees  have  retained  the  language  and  expanded  its  scope.  This  section  will  help  a  number  of  communities  across  the  country  seeking  to  use  surplus  property  to  protect  their  citizens  and  provide  safe,  secure  facilities  for  their  police  departments.  Without  this  amendment,  the  authority  to  convey  surplus  property  for  law  enforcement  purposes  would  have  expired  this  year.  Communities that want to use the GSA  process,  and  have  counted  upon  doing  so,  to  negotiate  the  use  of  property  for  law  enforcement  purposes  at  a  reduced  cost would have been shut out.  In  fact,  I  have  just  such  a  situation  in  my  own  home  State.  The  city  of  Kewaunee,  WI  wants  to  acquire  the  city\u2019s Army Reserve Center, which  is  a  former  Federal  armory  building.  The  city  intends  to  use  the  property  as  a  municipal  building  in  which  they  would  house  their  police  force  and  other municipal offices.  Congress  has  specified  a  number  of  public  purpose  uses  for  which  property  can  be  transferred  to  local  governments  at  a  reduced  cost.  The  Federal  Property  and  Administrative  Services  Act,  FPASA,  allows  property  to  be  transferred  to  public  agencies  and  institutions at discounts of up to 100 percent  of  fair market  value  for  a  number  of  purposes:  public  health  or  educational  uses,  public  parks  or  recreational  areas,  historic  monuments,  homeless assistance, correctional institutions,  port  facilities,  public  airports,  wildlife  conservation,  and  self-help  housing.  This  type  of  transfer  is  called  a public interest conveyance.  I  strongly  believe  that  law  enforcement  is  an  important  public  purpose  for  which  surplus  property  should  be  used.  Moreover,  in  fairness  to  local  communities  with  tight  budgets,  Congress  today  is  acting  to  permanently  preserve  this  option  for  communities  that  are  counting  on  being  able  to  use  this authority.  Mr.  President,  I  again  thank  the  bill\u2019s  managers,  the  Senior  Senator  from  Virginia  [Mr.  and  the  Senior  Senator  from  Michigan  [Mr.  LEVIN],  as  well  as  the  Senator  from  Tennessee  [Mr.  for  assisting  me  in  ensuring  provision  becomes law.  In  closing,  I  reiterate  my  concern  about  the excessive  spending contained  in  this  conference  report,  including  millions  in  taxpayers\u2019  dollars  for  planes, ships, and other equipment that  the President did not request.  We  should  reexamine our defense priorities,  and  we  should  do  it  as  soon  as  possible.  I thank the Chair.  Mr.  THOMPSON.  Mr.  President,  I  want  to express my  support  for  the Defense  Authorization  conference  report  and  to  thank  the  Chairman  of  the  Armed  Services  Committee,  Senator  and  the  Ranking  Member,  Senator  for  their  assistance  in  ensuring  that  the  conference  report  includes  a  provision  to  provide  comWARNER,  LEVIN,  THOMPSON],  WARNER]  this  BINGAMAN,  NEDY,  VOINOVICH,  DEWINE pensation to Department of Energy nuclear  weapons  workers  whose  health  was harmed  in the course of their service to our country.  Back  in  June,  when  the  Senate  first  considered  this  measure,  I  offered  an  amendment  along  with  Senator  Senator  Senator  KENSenator  and  others  to  establish  an  occupational  illness  compensation  program  for  these  DOE  workers  who  helped  us  win  the  Cold  War.  We  offered  the  amendment  after  my  Committee  and  others  heard  testimony  and  reviewed  evidence  that  showed  that,  for  decades,  the  federal  government\u2014and  specifically  the  Department  of  Energy\u2014failed  to  adequately  protect  its  workers  or  to  properly  inform  them  of  hazards  associated  with  the  important  work  they  were  performing.  In  some  cases,  we  simply  did  not  know  then  what  we  know  now  about  the  links  between  some  of  the  materials used to make weapons and certain  illnesses.  But  in  some  cases,  the  government  did  know\u2014and  yet  it  covered  up  and  kept  people  in  the  dark  and  failed  to  adequately  protect  them.  We  cannot go back and  right  that wrong.  I  wish  we  could.  But  we  can  face  up  to  the mistakes that were made and begin  to  try  to  remedy  them.  That  is  what  the Senate is about to do today.  This  conference  report  will  establish  a  compensation  program  for  Department of Energy and contractor employees  who  were  exposed  to  beryllium,  silica,  or  radiation  in  the  course  of  their  employment,  and  who  are  now  suffering  from  illnesses  that  can  be  linked to those exposures. The program  will  employ  eligibility  criteria  based  on expert judgement and sound science.  Under  the  compromise  that  was  reached  with  the  House,  the  President  will  be  required  to  send  to Congress  by  March  15th  of  next  year  a  specific  proposal  detailing  the  level  of  compensation  and  benefits  he  believes  should  be  paid.  Congress  will  then  have  until  July  31st  to  enact  specific  compensation  levels.  However,  if  Congress  does  not  act  by  July  31st,  a  default  benefit  level  of  $150,000  plus  medical  benefits  will take effect. Therefore, covered employees  are  guaranteed  to  receive  at  least  that  amount  unless  Congress  enacts  legislation  stating  otherwise  by  next July.  I  believe  this  is  a  good  compromise,  Mr. President. It is not everything that  the Senate  sponsors wanted,  but  it  is  a  start.  It  will  get  a  program  in  place,  allow  the  Administration  to  begin  to  identify  those  who  are  eligible,  and  guarantee  a  minimum  benefit  level  without  further  action  by  Congress.  Those are important victories for these  Cold  War  veterans  to  whom  we  owe  a  debt  of  gratitude.  Today  we  acknowledge  that  debt  of  gratitude,  as  well  as  a responsibility to remedy mistakes we  made.  So  again  I  want  to  thank  Chairman  for  his  support  of  this  imporprovision.  It  would  not  have  been  WARNER Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:15 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00105 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S12OC0.REC S12OC0 tant          ",

It  was  there  that  Sam  was  exposed  to  technetium,  plutonium,  neptunium,  and heavy metals. He has consequently  developed chondrosarcoma\u2014a rare type  of  bone  cancer.  As  the  medical  text,  Cancer  Epidemiology  and  Prevention,  by Doctors Schottenfeld and Fraumeni,  points  out,  cancers  of  the  bone  include  cancers  of  the  cartilage,  including  radiosensitive  cancers  that  originate  in  cartilage, such as chondrosarcoma.  Mr.  President,  let  me  conclude  by  thanking my  colleagues  once  again  for  supporting this program. I also want to  thank  the  many,  many  workers  who  came  to  Washington,  DC,  or  to  Columbus  to  testify  on  why  a  compensation  measure  is  needed.  They  worked  tirelessly  with  my  office  and  other  offices  to  get  us  to  where  we  are  today.  They  deserve  a  great  deal  of  the  credit  for  the program contained in this bill.  I  thank  the  Chair  and  yield  Floor.  Mr.  MCCAIN.  Mr.  President,  I  rise  today  in  support  of  H.R.  4205,  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal  Year  2001.  The  bill  that  passed  today  includes  several  amendments  that  significantly  improve  the  lives  of  active  duty  and  Reserve  servicemembers, military  retirees,  veterans, and their families.  I  am  pleased  that  the  conference  agreement  includes  some  key  legislative provisions that I had introduced in  the  Senate  during  the  course  of  the  normal  legislative  process.  Some  of  these  provisions  included  in  the  conference  report  will:  remove  servicemembers  from  food  stamps;  increase pay  for mid-grade Petty Officers  and  Non-Commissioned  Officers;  assist  disabled  veterans  in  claims  processing;  expand  pay  benefits  to  some  disabled  military  retirees;  authorize  a  low  cost  life  insurance  plan  for  spouses  and  their children; enhance benefits and retirement  pay  for  Reservists  and  National  Guardsmen;  authorize  back  pay  for  certain World War  II Navy  and Marine  Corps  Prisoners  of  War;  and  provide  for  significant  acquisition  reform  by eliminating domestic source restrictions  on  the  procurement  of  shipyard  cranes.  One  of  the  areas  of  greatest  concern  to  me,  however,  regarding  military  retirees  and  their  families  is  the  broken  promise  of  lifetime  medical  care,  especially  for  those  over  age  65.  Last  year,  the  Joint  Chiefs  proclaimed  that  this  would be the year for major health care  reform  for  our  military  forces,  especially  our  medicare-eligible  military  retirees  who  were  promised  lifetime  military  medical  care.  Despite  the  assurances  of  the Joint Chiefs,  the President proposed a  fiscal year  2001 defense  budget without any major medical care  reforms, and all but ignored those military  retirees  who  are  older  and  in  greatest need of health care.  The  Republican  Congress,  however,  responded  to  military  retirees\u2019  needs  and  provided  several  major  military  health care reforms as well as a plan in  this year\u2019s bill to provide all Medicare-  eligible military  retirees,  family members,  and  survivors  with  lifetime  military  health  care  coverage,  including  full  pharmacy  benefits  in  military,  retail,  and  mail  order  pharmacies.  This  conference  report  will  establish  \u2018\u2018TRICARE-for-life\u2019\u2019 as a permanent entitlement that will be funded through a  \u2018\u2018Military  Retirees  Health  Care  Trust  Fund,\u2019\u2019  a  legislative  provision  adopted  from  S.2013,  a  military  health  care  reform  bill  that  I  introduced  earlier  this  year. This new, critical lifetime benefit  will mean huge savings  for military retirees by eliminating the need for them  to  buy  expensive  Medicare  supplemental policies.  Separately,  with  severe  recruitment  and  retention  problems  still  looming,  we  must  also  better  compensate  our  mid-grade  enlisted  servicemembers  who  are  critical  to  leading  the  junior  enlisted  force.  We  have  significantly  underpaid  enlisted  servicemembers  since  the  beginning  of  the  All  Volunteer  Force.  The  value  of  the mid-grade  NCO pay, compared to that of the most  junior  enlisted,  has  dropped  50  percent  since  the  All  Volunteer  Force  was  put  in place by Congress  in  1973. The provision  for  the  mid-grade  enlisted  ranks,  up to $700 per year, plus the food stamp  pay  provision  of  up  to  an  additional  $500  per  month  for  servicemembers,  provides  a  significant  increase  in  pay  for enlisted servicemembers.  In  addition,  the  National  Guard  and  Reserves have become a larger percentage  of  the  Total  Force  and  are  essential  partners  in  a  wide  range  of  military  operations.  Due  to  the  higher  deployment  rates  of  the  active  duty  forces,  the  Reserve  Components  are  being  called  upon  more  frequently  and  for longer periods of time than ever before.  We  must  stop  treating  them  like  a second class force. It is tremendously  important  that  we  enact  meaningful  improvements  for  both  our  active  duty  and  Reserve  service-members,  their  families, and their survivors. They risk  their  lives  to  protect  our  freedom  and  preserve  democracy.  We  should  compensate  them  adequately,  improve  the  benefits to their families and survivors,  and  enhance  the  quality  of  life  for  the  Reserves and National Guard  in a manner similar to the active forces.  This  bill  goes  far  in  correcting  some  of  the  inconsistencies,  with  regard  to  Reserve  Component  policies,  that  previously  only  benefited  the  active  duty  components.  Additionally,  in  order  to  ensure that reservists receive  full credit  for  the  time  and  effort  they  commit  to  attending  drills,  performing  annual  training,  and  completing  correspondence  courses,  the  conference  report  increased  from  70  to  90  the  maximum  number of days per year that reservists  may  accrue  as  credit  towards  retirement benefits.  Each  year  the  number  of  disabled  veterans  appealing  their  health  care  cases  continues  to  increase.  Furthermore, it takes an average of 275 days to  get some sort of reply from the Department  of  Veterans  Affairs\u2019  regarding  claims  filing.  Disabled  veterans  are  forced  to  leave  the  service  because  of  their  disabilities.  It  is  Congress\u2019s  duty  to  ensure  that  the  disability  claims  process  is  less  complex,  less  burdensome,  and  much  more  efficient.  I  am  pleased that the final conference agreement  includes  legislation  necessary  to  fully  restore  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs\u2019  duty  to  ensure  efficient  and  timely  veterans  claims  processing  and remove onerous court-imposed procedures.  I commend the conference leaders for  including  some minimal  improvements  to  the  egregious  regulations  that  strip  retirement  pay  from  military  retirees  who  are  also  disabled,  and  cost  them  any  realistic opportunity  for post-service  earnings.  We  should  do  more  to  restore retirement pay for those military  retirees  who  are  disabled. With  respect  to  concurrent  receipt,  clearly,  retirees  who  have  incurred  significant  disabilities  over  the  course  of  a  military  career  deserve  better  than  how  they  are  treated currently.  Many  such  servicemembers  are  compelled  to  forfeit  their  full-retired  pay  under  current  rules.  I  have  stated  before on the Senate floor, and I am compelled  to  reiterate now,  retirement pay  and  disability  pay  are  two  distinct  types  of  pay.  Retirement  pay  is  for  service  rendered  through  20  years  of  military  service.  Disability  pay  is  for  physical  or  mental  pain  or  suffering  that  occurs  during  and  as  a  result  of  military  service.  In  this  case, members  with  decades  of  military  service  receive  the  same  compensation  as  similarly  disabled  members  who  served  only  a  few  years\u2014with  no  recognition  at  all  for  their  extended,  clearly  more  demanding  careers  of  service  to  our  country.  This  is  patently  unfair  and  even more must be done to correct this  problem.  I  would  also  like  to  point  out  that  this  year\u2019s  defense  authorization  bill  contained  over  $2  billion  in  unrequested  add-ons  to  the  defense  budget  that  will  rob  our  military  of  vital  funding  on  priority  issues.  While  this  year\u2019s  total  is  less  than  in  previous  years,  and  is  far  less  than  the  $7  billion  in  the  defense  appropriations  bill,  it  is  still  $2  billion  too  much.  We  need  to,  and  can  do,  better.  I  ask  that  the  detailed  list  of  pork  on  this  bill  be  included  in  the  Congressional  following my remarks.  I  have  to  wonder,  Mr.  President,  about  the  wisdom  of  permitting  the  Navy  to  potentially  violate  public  law  with  respect  to  the  status  of  the  last  two  battleships,  the  only  current  means  of  providing  high-volume  gunfire  support  for  land  forces  ashore,  while  simultaneously  continuing  to  provide millions of dollars  from the defense  budget  for  the  recovery  and  preservation of Civil War vessels.

Mr. President, I thank my  distinguished  colleague  for her very  eloquent  statement.  I  know  she  and  others  and  all  of  us  extend  our  deepest  sympathies  to  the  families,  the  loved  ones of those sailors who were killed in  the  cowardly  act  in  the  Gulf  of  Aden  today.  The  cause  of  peace  and  international security is one that is worth a  major  effort,  and  it  is  not without  sacrifices, as we saw today.  I  share  the  concerns  and  I  share  the  strong  commitment  that  we  shall  do  everything  in our power to  identify the  people  behind  this  cowardly  deed  and  take  appropriate  responsive  action. We  do  not  intend  as  a  democracy  committed to freedom and human rights to  be deterred  from our continuing efforts  by  these  acts  of  terrorism.  These  do  nothing  but  bring  sorrow  and  heartache to the families and loved ones left  behind, and  they  strengthen  the will of  the  rest  of  us  to  say  that  we  will  not  bow  to  the  terrorists  acts.  They  will  not  deter  us.  They  only  strengthen  us  not  only  in  our  prayers  for  those  who  have  given  the  ultimate  sacrifice  but  in  our  commitment  to  ensure  it  does  not deter our activities.  A TRAGIC ACT OF TERRORISM COLE  ON THE U.S.S.  Mr.  MCCAIN.  Mr.  President,  we  are  all  now  aware  of  a  terrible  tragedy,  an  act  of  despicable  terrorism  has  taken  place  on  the  U.S.S.  Cole  and  American  lives have been lost.  All of us are appalled. On behalf of all  of  us,  our  thoughts  and  prayers  go  out  to  the  family  members  of  those  on  the  U.S.S. Cole. We hope we  can  get  all  the  information as quickly as possible.  The  United  States  has  the  ability  to  find  out  who  perpetrated  this  outrage.  We will find those people. There will be  a  heavy  price  to  pay.  We  cannot  allow  these  kinds  of  acts  of  terror  to  take  place.  I  am  confident  the  President  of  the  United  States  will  ascertain  who  these  individuals  and  organizations  are,  and  the  heaviest  price  must  be  paid  for this outrage.  In the meantime,  our thoughts, hopes, and prayers go out  to  those  who  were  injured,  those  missing  in  action,  and  those  killed  in  this  tragedy.  TERRORISM  Mr. KYL. Mr. President,  first,  let me  concur  with  the  remarks  of  my  colleague,  Senator  MCCAIN.  I  join  him  in  expressing  concern  for  those  families  who have  lost Americans  in connection  with  the  terrorist  attack  on  the U.S.S.  Cole.  I  call  upon  my  colleagues  who  are  holding  up  my  antiterrorism  legislation  to  stop  holding  up  this  important  piece  of  legislation  and  allow  us  to  get  it  passed  this  year  and  sent  to  the  President  for  his  signature.  The  National  Terrorism  Commission  made  some very  important  recommendations  about  how  we  should  deal  with  terrorists  attacks,  and  the  only  response  has  been  the  legislation  that Senator FEINand I have proposed. I hope those  who are holding this legislation as a result  of  this  attack  will  recognize  we  can\u2019t  wait  for  the  next  terrorism  attack. We need to act now.  STEIN MIDDLE EAST TENSIONS  MCCAIN President,  my  morning  as  we  tensions  in  the  Mrs.  BOXER.  Mr.  heart  is  so  heavy  this  learn  of  the  increasing  Middle East.  I  join  my  friend  from  Arizona,  Senator  KYL,  in  expressing  our  condolences  to  those  American  families  who  are  grieving  at  the  loss  of  their  children  by  an  unprovoked  attack  on  one  of our ships off the coast of Yemen. We  are  not  exactly  sure  who  did  this.  We  suspect that it was terrorism.  But,  as  Senator  said  on  one  of  the  shows  this morning  as  I  listened  to him, we will find out, and we will respond.  The  world  should  make  no  mistake about that.  This  morning  I  also  want  to  call  on  Yasser  Arafat  to  take  control  of  the  situation in the Middle East. There has  been an  incident where  four  Israeli  soldiers  were  in  Ramallah\u2014the  Israelis  say  that  they  had  taken  a  wrong  turn.  They  certainly  weren\u2019t  provoking  anything.  They  were  captured,  and  taken  to  the  Palestinian  authorities  and  to  a  detention center. Then a mob overtook  the  center  and  killed  at  least  two  of  them.  The  reports  vary.  One  report  I  heard said there was a lynching. I don\u2019t  know  that  is  accurate,  but  one  report  said that. You have now no rule of  law.  It  is  very  difficult  to  negotiate  a  peace  agreement when  there  is no  rule of  law  on one side of the equation.  I  had  been  closely  following  this.  I  was  very  hopeful  yesterday.  Things  looked as if they were going in a better  direction.  The  word  was  that  Yasser  Arafat  was,  in  fact,  calming  his  people  down.  But  it  is  time  for  him  to  do  this  now  publicly.  It  is  one  thing  to  quietly  work  behind  the  scenes;  it  is  another  thing  to  come  out  publicly  and  say  enough of mob rule.  As  I  say,  I  come  here  with  a  very  heavy  heart,  but  always  hopeful  that  the  goodness  in  people  will  overcome  everything else.  My  heart  is  with  the  American  families  who  will  be  grieving.  My  heart  is  with all the families in the Middle East  who are suffering so much.  I  believe  Dwight  Eisenhower  once  said\u2014I  may  stand  corrected\u2014that  people  want  peace  so  much  that  one  of  these  days  governments  had  better  get  out  of  the  way  and  let  them  have  it.  I  think  people  want  peace.  The  vast majority of people want peace. How tragic  it  is  that  we  can\u2019t  seem  to  grasp  that.  I  praise  President  Clinton  and  Vice  President  for  doing  everything  they  can.  I  give  them  my  best.  I  offer  myself  as  someone  who  will  do  what  I  can.  I  am  on  the  Foreign  Relations  Committee.  This  is  an  area  that  we  know  is  always  a  tinderbox.  Yet  we  have  faith  that  the  peace  process  can  get back on track.  GORE BREAKDOWN OF CAMP DAVID PEACE PROPOSALS  Mr.  MOYNIHAN.  Mr.  President,  the  news  from  the  Middle  East  is  deeply  painful to all who pray  for the peace of  Jerusalem.  Three  months  ago  at  Camp  David  the  State  of  Israel  offered  the  Palestine  Authority  unprecedented  concessions  in  an  effort  to  end  the  cycle of violence and hatred. The rejection  of  these  proposals  has  tragically  led  to  the  loss  of  numerous  lives  and  the  resumption of  the  cycle of violence  and  hatred.  Our  Government  must  tell  the  Palestinian  leadership  that  the  destruction  of  holy  sites  and  mob  violence have no place in civilized society.  EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST  Mr.  FEINGOLD. Mr.  President,  I  rise  to  offer  my  sincere  condolences  to  the  families  of  the  U.S.  Navy  personnel  killed  in  what  appears  to  have  been  a  terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole, and  to express my outrage at this cowardly  act of murder. This deplorable  incident  is a tragic reminder of the risk and sacrifice  assumed  by  all  of  our  men  and  women  in  uniform,  and  by  their  families.  I  know  that  the  administration  will  be  using  all  of  the  resources  at  its  disposal  to  discern  who  is  responsible  for  the  attack,  and  that  the  U.S.  will  resolutely  take  appropriate  action  in  response to this incident.  My  certainty about  that  last point  is  based  on  a  simple  and  irrefutable  truth. No country would stand by while  its soldiers and sailors are targeted and  killed.  The  U.S.  will  certainly  not  stand for it and will not be intimidated  in  the  wake  of  the  cowardly  attack  on  the  Cole.  By  the  same  token,  it  should  surprise no one that Israel retaliated in  response to the brutal murder of Israeli  soldiers  at  the  hands  of  a  mob  in  Ramallah.  But  as  difficult  as  it  is,  as  raw  as  emotions  are  right  now,  we  cannot  afford  to  lose  sight  of  one  fundamental  fact.  All  of  us\u2014we  Americans,  the  rest  of  the  international  community,  the  Israelis  and  the  Palestinians\u2014know  that  there  is  no  military  solution  to  the  terribly  difficult  issues  that  have  made  the  Middle  East  a  region  of  tension  and  violence  for  far  too  long.  In  recent  days  the  promise  of  peace  has  been  obscured  by  terrible  violence  in  Jerusalem  and  elsewhere.  Nearly  100  lives have been lost, including the lives  of  children.  For  the  Israeli  and  Palestinian  children  who  remain,  in  the  name  of  providing  them  a  future  free  from  these  horrors,  I  hope  that  the  Israeli  and  Palestinian  people  will  find  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:15 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00121 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S12OC0.REC S12OC0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",

Mr.  President,  I  rise  today  to  recognize  the  celebration  of  National  Hispanic  Heritage  Month.  As  one  of  America\u2019s  largest  ethnic  groups, the Hispanic American community  embodies  the  true  spirit  of  our  country as a land where people from all  over  the  world  can  come  to  for  the  chance to pursue their dreams.  For  countless  years,  Hispanic  Americans  have  played  an  integral  role  in  American  society.  This  has  been  characterized  by  a  strong  work  ethic,  deep  sense  of  faith  and  unwavering  commitment  to  both  family  and  community.  Throughout the history of our country,  the  contributions  of  Hispanic  Americans  in  areas  such  as  public  service,  business,  entertainment,  and  the  sciences  have  been  lasting  and  have  made America a stronger nation.  Today,  there  are  more  than  31  million  Hispanic  Americans  living  in  the  United States, and they represent nearly  12  percent  of  our  total  population.  The  Hispanic  American  community  in  New  Jersey  includes  more  than  1  million  residents, with  roots  from  all  over  the  world,  including  Europe,  the  Carribean,  and  both  South  and  Central  America.  I  am  proud  to  have  the  opportunity  to  represent  a  State  with  one  of  the  largest  concentrations  of  Hispanic  Americans  in  the  entire  country.  The  vibrant  Hispanic  American  communities  across  the  State  have  given  New  Jerseyans  a window  into  their  cultures  and  heritage.  We  have  also  been  fortunate to have members of these communities  take  on  important  roles  in  our  public life. In New Jersey, we have Hispanic  Americans  representing  some  of  our  nation\u2019s most  diverse  communities  in  both  the  State  legislature  and  the  United  States  Congress,  and  dozens  more  hold  elected  office  at  the  county  and local levels.  As  we  begin  a  new  century,  it  is  projected  that  nearly  25  percent  of  America  will  be  of  Hispanic  origin  by  2050.  At the same time, the widespread influence of Hispanic Americans is touching  all  of  our  communities,  transcending  racial and ethnic boundaries on a daily  basis.  I  have  no  doubt  that  as  America\u2019s  Hispanic  American  community  grows,  it will maintain  the  legacy  that  it  has  built  while  also  adding  a  new  chapter to its rich history as an important piece of the American mosaic.  f  MCCAIN TIRE  STANDARDS  Mr.  ASHCROFT.  I  would  like  to  engage  in  a  brief  colloquy  with  Senator  the  Chairman  of  the  Senate  Commerce  Committee.  Yesterday,  the  Senate  took an  important  step  forward  in  improving  our  nation\u2019s  motor  vehicle safety  laws. One of the most  important  aspects  of  that  bill  was  a  provision  to  require  Department  of  Transportation to upgrade the Federal Motor  Vehicle  Safety  Standard  for  tires  for  the first time in nearly 30 years.  Because  it  has  been  so  long  since  the  standards  have  been  revised,  they  do  not  apply  to  tires  used  on  sport  utility  vehicles  (SUVs).  In  fact,  SUVs  weren\u2019t  even around when these standards were  last  developed.  Given  the  relationship  of  tires  to  the  rollover  propensity  of  SUVs,  I  would  expect  that  the  Department  should  first  upgrade  the  standards  for  those  tires  used  on  SUVs.  In  addition,  since  the  tire  standard  was  put  in  place  technology  for  the  construction  and  design  of  tires  has  improved  dramatically.  For  example,  nylon  ply  caps  can  significantly  improve  the  performance  of  tires.  The  types  vehicles  on  the  road  has  also  changed  as  more  and  more  people  choose  to  drive  sport  utility  vehicles.  Chairman  would  you  agree  that  the  Department  should  consider  new  technologies  that  would  improve  tire  safety  as  they  establish  the  new  tire standard and that they should also  consider  the  different  mix  of  vehicles  on  the  road  as  they  set  their  priorities  for implementing the new standard.  Mr.  MCCAIN.  I  concur  with  the  Senator  from  Missouri  that  a  variety  of  new  technologies  are  available  to  improve  the  design  and  construction  of  tires. The improved federal motor vehicle  safety  standard  for  tires  should  take  into  account  all  of  these  new  technologies  to  ensure  that  consumers  are  provided  with  safe  tires.  Additionally, the Department should implement  the rule in light of the changing mix of  types  of  vehicles  that  consumers  are  driving.  Mr.  ASHCROFT.  Well,  I  thank  the  Chairman  for  taking  the  time  to  answer  my  questions  and  the  hard  work  he  has  done  to  get  a  bill  passed  this  year.  MCCAIN f  FREIGHT  RAIL  TRANSPORTATION  \u2211Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President,  today  I  am  addressing  the  Senate  to  express  my view on a vital part of our Nation\u2019s  transportation  infrastructure\u2014the  freight railroads.  I  am  aware  of  concerns  that  have  been  raised  by  some  companies  that  ship by rail about the service and rates  available  to  them.  Certainly,  the  ability  to  safely,  economically  and  efficiently  transport  raw  materials  to  plants  and  finished  products  to  both  domestic  and  international  consumers  is  as  critical  as  the  actual  production  of these commodities and goods.  Since  1827  with  the  founding  of  the  Nation\u2019s  first  commercial  railroad,  the  B&O,  we  have  depended  on  the  rails  to  perform  this  function.  In  its  heyday,  the  iron  horse  dominated  transportation  of  goods  and  passengers.  Today,  after  surviving  nearly  total  collapse  in  the  1970s,  a  streamlined,  modernized  rail  industry  continues  to  play  a  role,  albeit  a  considerably  downsized  one,  in  the  transportation  marketplace.  Our  transportation  infrastructure  has  evolved\u2014now  trucks  on  the  interstate  highways  are  by  far  the  predominant  mode  of  transportation,  and  inland  barges  carry  coal  and  grain  on  our  nation\u2019s waterways.  As  many  of  you  know,  I  have  always  been  interested  in  rail  history.  Indeed,  Atlanta  was  originally  known  as  Terminus  because  of  the  railroads  which  were  sited  there.  What  history  has  taught  us  is  that  the  rails  require  a  continuing, massive capital investment  to  operate  safely.  In  the  late  1970s,  Congress  faced  the  dilemma  of  a  severely  under-capitalized  system  with  a  dismal  safety  performance.  The  rails  would  have  to  be  supported  by massive  federal  subsidy  or  freed  to  compete  in  the  marketplace  in  an  effort  to  generate  needed  capital.  Congress  wisely  chose  the  latter  course,  and  the  railroads  have  been  able  to  generate  the  quarter  trillion  dollars  needed  since  1980  to  support  the  infrastructure.  In  1999  alone,  the  private  investment  was  $16.2 billion, with  $2.87 of assets needed  for  every  dollar  of  revenue  produced.  The  industry\u2019s  vastly  improved  safety  record  in  large  part  is  a  testament  to  the  wisdom  of  that  infrastructure  investment.  Let  me  add  that  although  progress  in  this  area  has  been  significant,  nevertheless  this  safety  record  can  be  further  improved.  It  is my  hope  that  management  and  labor  will  work  together toward that end.  The  world  is  not  perfect,  of  course,  and  in  the  intervening  years  issues  have  arisen  which  must  be  addressed\u2014  issues  such  as  the  need  to  honor  the  hard  earned  collective  bargaining  agreements  of  railroad  workers.  Many  of  these  issues  have  been  brought  to  the  attention  of  Congress,  the  Interstate  Commerce  Commission  and  now  its  successor,  the  Surface  Transportation  Board,  STB.  Indeed,  the  Congress took a comprehensive look at rail  regulation  in  1995  when  it  created  the  STB.  I  know  some  companies  believe  their  rail  rates  are  excessive.  While  rates  have  declined  more  than  50  percent  since  1981,  some  customers  have  benefitted more  than  others,  reflecting  the  differential  pricing  put  into  place  by  the  Staggers  Rail  Act  of  1980.  This  has  led  in  part  to  complaints  being  heard  from  segments  of  the  shipping  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:15 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00129 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S12OC0.REC S12OC0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",

The  Hydrogen  Future  Act  gave  additional  functions  to  HTAP.  The  Act  requires  HTAP  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  Department\u2019s  Hydrogen  Program  and  make  recommendations  for  improvements.  HTAP  is  also  required  to  make  recommendations  for  future legislation.  The  panel,  appointed  by  the  Secretary of Energy, has broad representation  from  industry,  government,  and  academia.  While  some  members  of  the  panel  represent  the  hydrogen  community, others  represent  fossil  energy,  industrial  gases,  transportation,  and  environment  groups\u2014areas  affected  by  the development and deployment of hydrogen  energy  systems.  This  mix  provides  the  panel  with  a  balanced  perspective  that  allows  diversity  of  viewpoints.  Members  serve  on  a  pro-bono  basis.  HTAP,  in  its  report  to  Congress  has  strongly  endorsed  reauthorizing  the  Hydrogen  Future  Act.  Today\u2019s  bill  reflects  most  of  the  recommendations  of  this expert body.  The  long-term  vision  for  hydrogen  energy  is  that  sometime  well  into  21st  century,  hydrogen  will  join  electricity  as  one  of  our  Nation\u2019s  primary  energy  carriers,  and  hydrogen  will  ultimately  be  produced  from  renewable  sources.  But  fossil  fuels  will  be  a  significant  long-term  transitional  resource.  In  the  next  twenty  years,  increasing  concerns  about  global  climate  changes  and  energy  security  concerns  will  help  bring  about  penetration  of  hydrogen  in  several  niche markets.  The  growth  of  fuel  cell technology will allow the introduction  of  hydrogen  in  both  transportation and electricity sectors.  We are a long way from realizing this  vision  for  hydrogen  energy.  But  progress  is  being made  and many  challenges  and  barriers  remain.  Sustained  effort  is  the  only  way  to  overcome  these  challenges  and  barriers.  We  need  to  support  a  strategy  that  focuses  on  mid-term  and  long-term  goals.  We  must  support  development  of  technologies  that  enable  distributed  electric-generation  fuel  cell  systems  and  hydrogen  fuel  cell  vehicles  for  transportation  applications.  For  the  long-  term, we should look to hydrogen technologies  that  enhance  renewable  systems  and  offer  society  the  promise  of  clean, abundant fuels.  Significant  forces  are  coming  together  that  may  accelerate  wider  acceptance  of  hydrogen  as  an  energy  source.  Industry  is  moving  ahead  with  fuel  cell  developments  at  a  rapid  pace.  Many  companies  are  forming  partnerships  to  bring  new  technologies  to  the  market  place.  Daimler-Chrysler,  Ford,  and  Ballard  have  formed  a  partnership  and  pledged  $1.5  billion  for  commercialization  of  automotive  fuel  cells.  Edison Development Company, General  Electric,  SoCal  Gas,  and  Plug  Power  have  agreement  to  commercialize  residential  fuel cells. There are other companies  pursuing  the  same  market  sector  and  are  developing  high  performance  fuel  cell  technology  for  automotive  and  electrical  generation  systems.  Initiatives  for  controls  of  emissions  from  automobiles  such  as  California\u2019s  zero  emissions  vehicle  requirements  favor  early  introduction  of  hydrogen  powered  vehicles.  There  is  significant  industry  interest  in  bringing  fuel  cell  technology to mining operations.  The  Department  of  Energy  administers  the  Hydrogen  Program  that  supports  a  broad  range  of  research  and  development  projects  in  the  areas  of  hydrogen  production,  storage,  and  use  in  a  safer  and  less  expensive  manner  in  the  near  future. Progress  in  several  research  and  development  areas  shows  promise  that  some  of  these  new  technologies  may  become  available  for  wider  use  in  the  next  few  years.  Some  of  the  promising  technologies  include  advanced  natural  gas-  and  biomass-  based  hydrogen  production  technologies,  high  pressure  gaseous  and  cryogas  storage  systems,  reversible  PEM  fuel  cell  systems.  Others  lay  the  groundwork  for  long  range  opportunities.  The  Hydrogen  Program  utilizes  the  talents of our national laboratories and  our  universities.  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory,  Sandia,  Lawrence  Livermore,  Los  Alamos,  and  Oak  Ridge,  as  well  as  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory  are  involved  in  the  program.  DOE  Field  Office  at  Golden,  Colorado,  and  Nevada  Operations  Office  in  Nevada  are  also  involved.  University-led  centers-of-excellence  have  been  established  at  Florida  Solar  Energy  Center  at  University  of  Miami  and  University  of  Hawaii.  The  U.S.  participation  in  the  International  Energy  Agency  contributes  to  the  advancement  of  DOE  hydrogen  research  through  international cooperation.  The  DOE  Hydrogen  Program  is  well  managed  and  run  by  dedicated  managers  and  capable  and  talented  technologists.  The  program  has  also  built  strong  links  with  the  industry.  This  has  resulted  in  strong  industry participation  and  cost  sharing.  HTAP,  in  its  review  of  the  program  reached  similar  conclusions.  The  legislation  I  am  introducing  today  reauthorizes  the  Hydrogen  Future  Act  and  adds  provisions  for  the  demonstration  of  hydrogen  technologies  at  government  facilities.  It  highlights  the potential of hydrogen as  an  efficient  and  environmentally  friendly  source  of  energy,  the  need  for  a  strong  partnership  between  the  Federal  government,  industry,  and  academia,  and  the  importance  of  continued  support  for  hydrogen  research.  It  fosters  collaboration  between  Federal  agencies,  state  and  local  governments,  universities,  and  industry.  It  encourages  private  sector  investment  and  cost  sharing  in  the  development  of  hydrogen as an energy source.  The  legislation  authorizes  $250  million  over  the  next  five  years  for  research  and  development  of  technologies  for  hydrogen  production,  storage  and  use.  This  will  allow  advancement  of  technologies  such  as  smaller-  scale  production  systems  that  are  applicable  to  distributed-generation  and  vehicle applications, advanced pressure  vessels,  photobiological  and  photocatalytic production of hydrogen,  and  carbon  nanotubes,  graphite  nanofibers, and fullerenes.  It also authorizes $50 million  for conducting  integrated  demonstrations  of  hydrogen  technologies  at  government  facilities.  This  will  help  secure  industry  participation  through  competitive  solicitations  for  technology  development and testing. It may encourage integration  of  renewable  energy  resources  with  hydrogen  storage  in  distributed  power  scenarios.  It  will  test  the  viability  of  hydrogen  production,  storage,  and  use.  It  will  lead  to  development  of  hydrogen-based  operating  experience  acceptable  to  meet  safety  codes and standards.  By supporting the development of hydrogen  technologies,  we  will  be  ushering  in  an  era  of  a  non-polluting  source  of  energy  that  will  reduce  our  dependence on foreign oil. The price we  will  pay  for  development  of  this  clean  and  renewable  energy  is  minuscule  compared  to  the  benefits.  And  Mr.  President, if we develop hydrogen technologies,  we  will  be  less  likely  to  be  held hostage  by  our  friends  in  the Middle East.

RES. 375  Whereas  the  stability  of  democracy  in  Latin  America  and  the  eradication  of  illegal  narcotics  from  the  Andean  nations  are  vital  national  security  interests  of  the  United  States;  Whereas  the  democratically  elected  Government  of Bolivia has  taken  dramatic  steps  to  eradicate  illegal  narcotics  under  the  Dignity  Plan,  resulting  in  the  elimination  of  80  percent  of  the  illegal  coca  crop  in  just  two  years,  a  record  of  achievement  unmatched  worldwide;  Whereas  the Government  of  Bolivia  is  now  approaching  the  completion  of  coca  eradication  in  the  Chapare  and  will  begin  eradication  operations  in  the  Yungas  regions  in  2002;  Whereas  there  are  indications  that  narcotics  traffickers  from  outside  Bolivia  are  stepping  up  efforts  to  keep  a  foothold  in  Bolivia  by  agitating  among  the  rural  poor  and  indigenous  populations,  creating  civil  disturbances,  blockading  roads,  organizing  strikes  and  protests,  and  taking  actions  designed  to  force  the Government of Bolivia  to  abandon  its  aggressive  counter  narcotics  campaign; and  Whereas  the government of Bolivian President Hugo Banzer Suarez has  shown  remarkable  restraint  in  dealing  with  the  protesters  through dialogue and openness while respecting human rights: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved,  That  (a)  the  Senate  calls  upon  the  Government  of  Bolivia  to  continue  its  successful  program  of  coca  eradication  and  looks  forward  to  the  Government  of  Bolivia  achieving its commitment to the total eradication of illegal coca in Bolivia by the end of  2002.

SEC.  2.  The  Secretary  of  the  Senate  shall  transmit  a  copy  of  this  resolution  to  the  President.  Mr.  LUGAR.  Mr.  President,  I  rise  to  introduce a resolution in support of democracy  and  drug  eradication  in  Bolivia.  I\u2019m  pleased  that  I  have  been  joined  by  several  colleagues  in  a  bipartisan  initiative  to  applaud  and  support  one  of  the  most  successful  drug-eradication programs in the world.  Our  resolution  recognizes  that  extraordinary  achievements  of  Bolivia\u2019s  narcotics  elimination  program.  It  urges  the  Government  of  Bolivia  to  continue  its  program  of  drug  elimination  while  upholding  the  rule  of  law  and  safeguarding  human  rights.  It  also  urges  the  indigenous  leaders  to  cease  provocative  acts  and  begin  discussions  with  the  Government  of  Bolivia  to  resolve outstanding issues.  For  nearly  two  weeks  now,  Bolivia  has  been  confronting  one  of  the  worst  social  upheavals  the  country  has  endured  in the past two decades. The turmoil  has  been  perpetrated  by  diverse  forces  in  Bolivia,  particularly  those  who  wish  to  reverse  the  drug  eradication program in the country.  A  destabilization  campaign,  initiated  by  drug  traffickers,  has  resulted  in  a  number  of  protests  that  have  virtually  paralyzed  the  country. Roads  that  connect  the  major  cities  of  the  country  were  destroyed  and  blockaded  and  the  flow  of  food  to  the  urban  centers  has  been interrupted. Nearly a dozen people  have  died  and  more  have  been  injured  by  acts  of  violence.  Economic  losses  are  estimated  at  more  than  $160  million and growing.  The  protesters,  who  are  led  by  coca  growers,  were  demanding  the  resignation of the President, the suspension of  the  anti-drug  strategy,  and  the  elimination  of  plans  to  build  a  U.S.  funded  military installation in the Chapare region\u2014the  region  where  most  illegal  coca has been cultivated. They also demand  that  the Government  allow  peasants  of  the  Chapare  to  replant  about  6,000  hectares  of  coca,  which,  if  that  is  allowed to happen, would yield roughly  42 tons of cocaine.  President  Banzer  has  flatly  rejected  most  demands  to  changes  in  the  Bolivian drug strategy, the Dignity Plan. He  has,  nevertheless,  agreed  to  suspend  plans  for  the  construction  of  a  new  military  installation  in  the  Chapare  and  proposed  to  refurbish  the  existing  installation instead.  Other  groups  in  Bolivia  have  added  a  number  of  unrelated  demands  which  appeared  to  be  coordinated  by  or  to  be  in  concert  with  the  coca  leaders.  Teachers,  for  example,  have  demanded  pay  raises,  inmates have  asked  for  better  jail  conditions,  peasants  demanded  a  modification  of  laws  on  land  ownership,  doctors  requested  better  pay,  and  agitators exploited the current state of  affairs  to  amplify  racial  division.  Isolated  by  themselves,  these may  be  reasonable  requests  but  when  they  are  raised  or  orchestrated  by  drug  traffickers, the goals become more malevolent.

Mr. President,  I  will  not  speak  but  a  minute,  along  with my  colleague,  Senator WYDEN. He  and  I  come  to  the  floor  to  celebrate  what  Senator  will  do  later  this  evening  by  unanimous  consent,  and  that is passage of H.R. 4828. It has to do  with  the  high  Steens  area  of  southeastern  Oregon.  It  is  a  beautiful  and  pristine area.  What  we  have  done  is  truly  bipartisan  and  truly  historic  in  that  the  Sierra  Club  and  the  Oregon  Cattlemen\u2019s  Association  enthusiastically  support  it.  They  support  it  because  this  has  been a product of dialog and not Executive  dictate.  This  has  come  about  because  people  of  good  will  have  said:  How  can  we  protect  the  environment  and protect the people as well? We have  accomplished  that  in  this  bill.  We  are  creating  170,000  acres  of wilderness  and  providing  other  places  for  people  to  pursue their ranching lifestyles, and we  are  preserving  the  economy  of  Harney  County.  I thank all of my colleagues\u2014my colleague  in  the  Senate,  Senator  Congressman  all  of  the  Oregon  Congressmen,  Republicans  and  Democrats  alike;  and  the  Governor  of  Oregon  as  well;  and  Secretary  Bruce  Babbitt  who  worked  with  us  in  good  faith to make this possible. I thank the  Chair and yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  ator from Oregon.  Mr.  WYDEN.  Mr.  President,  friend  and  colleague,  Senator  has  said  it  extremely  well,  and  I  know  our  colleague  Senator  is  waiting  to speak, so I, too, will be very brief.  My  view  is  that  this  Steens  legislation  is  a  monumental  wilderness  triumph.  This  legislation  creates  for  the  first  time  in  statute  cow-free  wilderness.  In  the  past,  wilderness  designations  allowed  the  continuation  of  historic grazing practices, but because the  ranchers  in  the  Steens  recognize  the  delicate  nature  of  this  ecosystem  and  because they were willing to work with  Democrats and Republicans  in our congressional  delegation,  Congressman  Congressman  and  so  many  of  our  colleagues,  we  were  able  to  build  a  coalition  for  a  truly  historic  approach  to  protecting our wilderness.  We were able to find acceptable alternative  grazing  sites.  Almost  100,000  acres  of  the  total  wilderness  designation is now going to be by law cow free.  In  my  view,  this  is  just  an  example,  a  precedent  of  how  communities  can  work together to protect our treasures.  All  across  this  country  when  there  are debates about national monuments,  the  sides  go  into  opposing  and  what  amounts  to  warring  camps,  the  decibel  level  gets  very  high,  and  there  is  an  awful lot of finger pointing and accusations.  In  Oregon,  we  did  it  differently.  We  came  up with  an Oregon  solution.

            "310": "October 12, 2000  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE S10499  COBLE  BERMAN of  exploring  what  more  comprehensive  settlement we might  reach with  regard  to the status of sound recordings under  the  copyright  law,  which  will  allow  them  to  continue  their  creative works.  Mr.  LEAHY.  Mr.  President,  more  than  a week  ago  I  came  to  the  floor  to  be  sure  the  record  was  clear  that  all  Democrats  had  cleared  for  final  passage  H.R.  5107,  the  Work  for  Hire  and  Copyright  Corrections  Act  of  2000.  I  urged  the  Senate  to  take  up  H.R.  5107  without  further  unnecessary  delay.  I  am  glad  that  the  majority  has  finally  decided  that  action  on  this  consensus  bill  is  appropriate.  I  still  do  not  know  what  caused  the  unexplained  2-week  delay on the Republican side.  Representatives  and  deserve  credit,  along  with  the  interested  parties,  for  working  out  a  consensus  solution  in  this  legislation.  The  purpose  of  this  bill  is  to  restore  the  status  quo  ante,  as  it  existed  before  November  29,  1999  regarding  whether  a  sound recording can qualify as a  \u2018\u2018work  made for hire\u2019\u2019 under the second part of  the  definition  of  that  term  in  section  101  of  the  Copyright  Act,  and  to  do  so  in  a  manner  that  does  not  prejudice  any  person  or  entity  that  might  have  interests  concerning  this question. The  House  held  an  oversight  hearing  to  explore  this  matter  earlier  this  year  and  originated this  legislation. This bill restores  the  law  to  the  same place  it was  before  the  enactment  of  section  1101(d)  of  the  Intellectual  Property  and  Communications  Omnibus  Reform  Act  of  1999,  as  enacted  by  section  1000(a)(9)  of  Public  Law  Number  106\u2013113,  so  that  neither  side  is  prejudiced  by  what  was  enacted at the end of 1999 or by what is  being  enacted  now.  This  bill  does  not  express  or  imply  any  view  as  to  the  proper interpretation of the work made  for  hire  definition  before  November  29,  1999.  Thus,  neither  the  enactment  of  section 1101(d) nor this bill\u2019s deletion of  that  language  are  to  be  considered  in  any  way  or  otherwise  given  any  effect  by  a  court  or  the  Copyright  Office  when  interpreting  the  work  made  for  hire definition.  I  congratulate  Congressmen  and  on  final  passage  measure.  Mr.  MURKOWSKI.  Mr.  President,  I  ask unanimous consent that the bill be  read  a  third  time  and  passed,  the  motion  to  reconsider  be  laid  upon  the  table, and that any statements relating  to the bill be printed in the RECORD.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The bill (H.R. 5107) was read the third  time and passed.

Further,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the  convention  be  considered  as  having been  read  the  first  time,  that  it  be  referred  with  accompanying  papers  to the Committee on Foreign Relations  and ordered  to be printed, and  that  the  President\u2019s  message  be  printed  in  the  RECORD.  is  as  Without  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  objection, it is so ordered.  The  message  of  the  President  follows:  To the Senate of the United States:  With  a  view  to  receiving  the  advice  and  consent  of  the  Senate  to  ratification,  I  transmit  herewith  the  International  Convention  for  the  Suppression  of  the  Financing  of  Terrorism,  adopted  by  the United Nations General  Assembly  on  December  9,  1999,  and  signed on behalf of the United States of  America  on  January  10,  2000.  The  report  of  the  Department  of  State  with  respect to the Convention is also transmitted  for  the  information  of  the  Senate.  In  recent  years,  the  United  States  has  increasingly  focused  world  attention  on  the  importance  of  combating  terrorist  financing  as  a means  of  choking  off  the  resources  that  fuel  international terrorism. While international  terrorists  do  not  generally  seek  financial  gain  as  an  end,  they  actively  solicit  and  raise  money  and  other  resources to attract and retain adherents  and  to  support  their  presence  and  activities  both  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  The  present  Convention  is  aimed  at  cutting  off  the  sustenance  that these groups need to operate. This  Convention provides,  for the  first time,  an obligation that States Parties criminalize such conduct and establishes an  international  legal  framework  for  cooperation  among  States  Parties  directed  toward  prevention  of  such  financing  and  ensuring  the  prosecution  and  punishment  of  offenders,  wherever  found.  Article  2  of  the  Convention  states  that  any  person  commits  an  offense  within  the  meaning  of  the  Convention  \u2018\u2018if  that  person  by  any  means,  directly  or  indirectly,  unlawfully  and  willfully,  provides  or  collects  funds  with  the  intention  that  they  should  be  used  or  in  the knowledge that they are to be used,  in full or in part, in order to carry out\u2019\u2019  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:15 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00225 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S12OC0.REC S12OC0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",
            "318": "October 12, 2000  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE S10507  Compromise Agreement  Section  206  of  the  compromise  agreement  incorporates  portions  of  both  the  House  and  Senate  language.  The  Committees  call  upon  VA  to  provide  the  individual  selected  as  Advisor on Physician Assistants with necessary  support and resources to enable this consultant  to  fulfill  the  assigned  responsibilities  of  the position.  EXTENSION OF VOLUNTARY SEPARATION  PAYMENTS  INCENTIVE Current Law  Public  Law  106\u2013117,  the  Veterans  Millennium  Health  Care  and  Benefits  Act  of  1999,  authorized  a  temporary  program  of  voluntary  separation  incentive  payments  to  assist  VA  in  restructuring  its  workforce.  This  program  limited  VA  to  a  15\u2013month  authorization  period  for  such  \u2018\u2018buyouts\u2019\u2019  of VA  employees,  limited  to  4,700  the  number  of  staff  who  could  participate,  and  required  VA  to  make  a  contribution  of  26  percent  of  the  average  salary  of  participating  employees  to  the  Civil  Service  Retirement  and  Disability  Fund.  This  provision  also  requires  a  one-for-  one  employee  replacement  for  each  such  buyout approved under this policy.  House Bill  Section  107  of  H.R.  5109  would  amend  title  XI  of  Public  Law  106\u2013117  to  increase  the  number  of  VA  positions  subject  to  buyouts  to  8,110.  The  House  measure  would  also  adjust  the  contribution made  by  VA  to  the  retirement  fund  to  15  percent,  an  amount  equivalent  to  the  amount  that  most  other  Federal agencies must contribute to the fund  for  their  buyout  participants.  The  measure  extends  VA\u2019s  buyout  authority  from  December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2002.  Senate Bill  The  Senate  provision.  Compromise Agreement  Section  207  of  the  compromise  agreement  follows  the  House  language,  but  limits  the  number  of  VA  positions  subject  to  buyouts  to 7,734 and allocates the positions for activities  of  the  Veterans  Health  Administration,  Veterans  Benefits  Administration,  National  Cemetery  Administration,  and  VA  staff  offices.  Subtitle B\u2014Military Service Issues  comparable  contain  bills  no  MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY  Current Law  No provision.  House Bill  Section  301  of  H.R.  5109  would  require  VA  to  take  and  maintain  a  thorough  history  of  each  veteran\u2019s  health,  including  a  military  medical history. Ascertaining  that a veteran  was  a  prisoner  of  war,  participated  directly  in  combat,  or  was  exposed  to  sustained  subfreezing  conditions,  toxic  substances,  environmental  hazards,  or  nuclear  ionizing  radiation  often  facilitates  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  veterans.  The  House  bill  would  provide  veterans  assurance  that  such  a  policy  becomes a matter of routine clinical practice  in VA.  Senate Bill  The  Senate  provision.  Compromise Agreement  Section  211  of  the  compromise  agreement  adopts  the  intent  of  the  House  proposal,  but  in  the  form  of  a  Sense  of  the  Congress Resolution  to  express  the  sense  of  Congress  that  VA proceed  to  implement a  system of  record  keeping to record veterans\u2019 military history.  comparable  contain  bills  no  STUDY OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER  VETERANS  (PTSD) IN VIETNAM Current Law  Public Law 98\u2013160 directed VA to conduct a  large-scale  survey  on  the  prevalence  and  incidence  of  PTSD  and  other  psychological  problems  in  Vietnam  veterans.  The  study  found that 15 percent of male and 8.5 percent  of  female  Vietnam  veterans  suffered  from  PTSD. Among those exposed to high levels of  war  zone  stress,  however,  PTSD  rates  were  dramatically  higher.  Also,  the  study  found  that  nearly  one-third  of  Vietnam  veterans  had  suffered  from  PTSD  at  some  point  after  military service.  House Bill  Section  302 of HR  5109 would direct  the VA  to  enter  into  a  contract  with  an  \u2018\u2018appropriate entity\u2019\u2019 to carry out a  follow-up study  to  the  study conducted under Public Law  98\u2013  160.  Senate Bill  The  Senate  provision.  Compromise Agreement  Section  212  of  the  compromise  agreement  contains  the  House  language.  The  Committees  agree  the  new  study  should  be  kept  distinct  and  independent  from  VA,  as  in  the  original.  The  compromise  agreement  is  not  intended  to  pre-judge  the  entity  that  will  win this award.  Subtitle C\u2014Medical Administration  comparable  contain  bills  no  DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS HOUSES  AFFAIRS FISHER  Current Law  Current  law does not explicitly provide VA  with  authority  to  house  veterans  overnight  to  expedite  outpatient  care  or  next-day  hospital  admissions.  Nor  does  current  law  provide  explicit  authority  for  VA  to  accept,  maintain,  or  operate  facilities  for  housing  families  or  others  who  accompany  veterans  to  VA  facilities.  However,  most  VA  medical  centers  offer  veterans  who  live  some  distance  from  a  medical  facility  from  which  they  are  receiving  care  or  services  help with  some  form  of  lodging  to  facilitate  scheduled  visits  or  admissions.  Indeed,  more  than  115  facilities  offer  lodging  of  some  kind  on  VA  grounds,  and  services  are  available  in  non-  VA  facilities  at  a  number  of  other  locations.  Also,  over  the  years,  many  VA  medical  centers  have  converted  unused  wards  and  other  available  space  to  establish  temporary  lodging  facilities  for  use  by  patients.  The  Under  Secretary for Health has encouraged medical  centers  to  establish  such  facilities  to  avert  the need for hospitalizing patients when outpatient  treatment  is  more  appropriate.  This  guidance  to  VA  facilities  suggested  that  facilities could provide  lodging without charge  to outpatients and their family members and  others  accompanying  veterans  when  \u2018\u2018medically  necessary.\u2019\u2019  The  guidance  also  sanctioned the use of a revocable license for family members under which an individual could  be required to pay VA a fee equal to the fair-  market value of the services being furnished.  House Bill  Section  404  of  H.R.  5109  would  clarify  VA\u2019s  authority  to  provide  temporary  overnight  accommodations  in  \u2018\u2018Fisher  Houses,\u2019\u2019  built  with  funds  donated  by  the  Zachary  and Elizabeth  M.  Fisher  Foundation.  Four  such  facilities  are  now  being  operated  in  conjunction with VA medical centers and other similar facilities located at or near a VA facility.  These  accommodations  are  available  to  veterans who  have  business  at  a VA medical  facility  and must  travel  a  significant  distance  to  receive Department  services,  and  to  other  individuals  accompanying  veterans.  Section  404  would  also  give  VA  clear  authority  to  charge  veterans  (and  those  accompanying  them)  for  overnight  accommodations  and  apply  fees  collected  to  support  continuation  of  these  services. The measure would  require  VA  to  promulgate  regulations  to  address  matters  such  as  the  appropriate  limitations  on  the  use  of  the  facilities  and  the  length  of  time individuals may stay in the facilities.  Senate Bill  The  Senate  provision.  Compromise Agreement  Section  221  of  the  compromise  contains the House language.  comparable  agreement  contain  bills  no  EXCEPTION TO THE RECAPTURE RULE  Current Law  Section 8136 of title 38, United States Code,  requires  VA  to  \u2018\u2018recapture\u2019\u2019  the  amount  of  a  grant  to  a  state  home  for  purposes  of  building  or  renovating  a  state  veterans  home,  if,  within  20  years,  the  state  home  ceases  to  be  used  for  providing  domiciliary,  nursing  home, or hospital care for veterans. This provision  could  be  interpreted  to  require  recapture of the grant if the state home allows VA  to  establish  an  outpatient  clinic  in  the  home.  House Bill  Section  406  of  H.R.  5109  would  clarify  that  establishment  of  an  outpatient  clinic  in  a  state home would not constitute grounds entitling  the  United  States  to  recover  its  grant.  Senate Bill  The  Senate  provision.  Compromise Agreement  Section  222  of  the  compromise  contains the House language.  comparable  agreement  contain  bills  no  SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING COOPERATION  AFBETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS FAIRS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IN  THE PROCUREMENT OF MEDICAL ITEMS  Current Law  Under  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  and  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  Health  Resources  Sharing  and  Emergency  Operations  Act,  Public  Law  97\u2013174,  VA  and  DOD have the authority to share medical resources.  In  1999,  VA  and  DOD  entered  into  sharing agreements amounting to $60 million  dollars  out  of  combined  budgets  of  approximately  $35  billion.  This  is  resource  sharing  of  less  than  two-tenths  of  one  percent.  On  May  25,  2000,  the  General  Accounting  Office  reported  that  greater  joint  pharmaceutical  procurements alone could lead to as much as  $345 million in annual recurring savings.  House Bill  H. Con. Res.  413 would  encourage  expanded  joint  procurement  of  medical  items,  to  include prescription drugs.  Senate Bill  The  Senate  provision.  Compromise Agreement  Section  223  of  the  compromise  contains the House language.  Subtitle D\u2014Construction Authorization  comparable  agreement  contain  bills  no  AUTHORIZATION OF MAJOR MEDICAL PROJECTS  FACILITY  Current Law  Section 8104 of title 38, United States Code,  provides  that  no  funds  may  be  appropriated  for any  fiscal year, and VA may not obligate  or expend  funds  (other than  for planning and  design)  for  any medical  construction  project  involving a total expenditure of more than $4  million  unless  funds  for  that  project  have  been specifically authorized by law.  House Bill  Section  201  of  H.R.  5109  would  authorize  the  construction  of  a  gero-psychiatric  care  building  at  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  Medical  Center,  Palo  Alto,  California  ($26.6  million);  the  construction  of  a  utility  plant and electrical vault at the Department  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:15 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00233 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\u20ac0SENATE\\S12OC0.REC S12OC0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",
            "326": "October 12, 2000  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD \u2014 SENATE S10515  fight for themselves\u2014we remain unable  to  fully  eliminate  the  restriction,  as  I  wish  we  could.  However,  we  are  doing  the  next  best  thing\u2014raising  the  limits  to  a  more  realistic  dollar  amount  and  indexing  it  to  account  for  future  increases  in  compensation.  Section  304  provides that the $1,500 will be replaced  with  the  dollar  value  represented  by  five  times  the  100-percent  service-connected  compensation  rate,  and  that  amount  will  be  indexed  to  include  future  cost-of-living  adjustments.  If  we  can\u2019t eliminate this type of discrimination,  I  am  gratified  that  we  could  at  least  reduce  its  application  and  impact.  I  am  especially  pleased  that  this  legislation  includes  authorization  for  the  construction  of  a  $9.5  million  nursing  home  in  Beckley,  West  Virginia.  With  the  World  War  II  and  Korean  War  veteran  population  aging,  there  is  a  increased  demand  for  an  alternative  to  private  long-term  care,  which  is  often  costly  and  beyond  the  reach  of  many  veterans and  their  families.  I  fought  so  hard  for  this  federally  funded  facility  because  it  will  be  available  to  all  veterans  in  need  of  care,  regardless  of  income.  It will  also  contain  a  20-bed Alzheimer\u2019s  unit,  to  meet  the  special  needs  of  those  suffering  from  this  horrible  disease.  Long-term  care  for  Alzheimer\u2019s  patients  is  very  limited  in  southern  West  Virginia,  and  the  Beckley VA Medical Center must often send  veterans  outside  the  state  for  this  specialized  care.  Quality  long-term  care  for West Virginia veterans is long overdue.  Currently,  the  Senate  is  deliberating  on a bill that would appropriate $1 million  in  design  funds  for  this  project.  I  am  hopeful  that  we  will  get  the  full  amount  needed  for  completion  of  the  facility in the near future.  I  am  very  proud  of  the  nurses\u2019  pay  provision  in  section  201  of  S.  1402,  which  finally  gives  a  very  valued  segment  of  VA\u2019s  health  care  staff  their  due. Since  the  inception of  the  locality  pay  system  in  1990,  which  determined  the  rate  of  pay  for  nurses  according  to  trends  in  local  health  care  labor  markets,  only  some  nurses  in  the  VA  system nationwide have  actually  seen  pay  increases.  This  was  an  unjust  consequence  of  implementing  the  locality  pay  system  that  I  am  very  glad we  can  now rectify.  This  bill  prohibits  directors  from  reducing  nurses\u2019  pay,  and  guarantees  VA  nurses  a  national  comparability  increase  equivalent  to  that  provided  to  other  federal  employees.  Additionally,  it  reforms  the  local  labor  market  survey  process  currently  used  to  determine wages. Finally,  I  am  pleased  that  this  provision  also  requires  Veterans  Health  Administration  network  directors  to  consult  directly  with  nurses  on  policy  issues  that  involve  the  work  of  VA  nurses,  and  allows  registered  nurses to participate on medical center  committees  considering  clinical  care,  budget  matters,  or  resource  allocation  involving  the  care  and  treatment  of  veteran patients.  Section  202,  the  dentists\u2019  pay  provision  of  S.  1402,  is  one  that  I  am  very  satisfied  with  as  it  seeks  to  improve  the  recruitment  and  retention  of  dentists within the VA, and, therefore, the  level  of  dental  care  our  veterans  receive  as  well.  The  basic  pay  rates  of  dentists  employed  in  the  VHA  are  supplemented by special pay and  incentive  pay scales that were originally enacted  with  the  intent  of  helping  recruitment  and  retention  rates.  However,  they  were not sufficient enough to keep this  vital  sector  of  veterans\u2019  care  secured.  This bill will build on what was already  started  nearly  10  years  ago  by  finally  revising  and  increasing  the  rates  of  special pay for VA dentists.  Another  important  provision  in  this  legislation  that  I  am  very  proud  of  is  the  creation  of  a  physician  assistant  advisory  position  within  the  Veterans  Health Administration  (VHA). This  position  will  finally  give  voice  to  a  very  essential  segment  of  the  VA  health  care system.  Current  law  requires  that  the  office  of  Under  Secretary  for  Health  in  the  VA include representatives of a variety  of health care professions. However, despite  the  fact  that  the  VA  is  the  nation\u2019s  largest  single  employer  of  physician  assistants,  physician  assistants  have not had any representation within  this office.  That  is  why  I  am  pleased  to  be  able  to  provide  these  often  underrated  health  care  workers  with  their  own  representative  advisor.  The  VA  Under  Secretary  for  Health  will  designate  a  VHA physician assistant to  fill this position  and  charge  that  person  with  advising on all matters regarding the employment  and  use  of  physician  assistants  within  the  Veterans  Health  Administration.  The  advisor  may  be  assigned  out  in  the  field  with  periodical  visits  as  necessary  to  VHA  headquarters  for  reports,  so  that  they  are  able  to  keep  in  touch  both  with  physician  assistants  working  all  over  the  country  and  the  VA  Under  Secretary  for  Health  in  VA  Headquarters.  The  language  associated  with  this  section  specifically  calls  upon  VA  to  provide  this  individual  with  the  necessary  support  and  resources  to  enable  this  consultant  to  fulfill  the  assigned  responsibilities of this position.  Just  over  15  years  ago,  the  VA  conducted  a  large-scale  survey  on  the  occurrence  of  PTSD  and  other  psychological  problems  in  Vietnam  veterans.  The  study  found  that  15  percent  of  male veterans and 8.5 percent of female  veterans suffered from PTSD. However,  among  those  veterans  exposed  to  higher levels of war zone stress, PTSD rates  were  significantly  higher.  In  addition,  the  study  found  that  nearly  one-third  of  both  male  and  female  Vietnam  veterans  had  suffered  from  PTSD  at  some  point following military service.  Therefore,  I  am  very  gratified  that  this  bill  provides  for  a  followup  study  to  be  conducted  to  monitor  the  effectivness  of  the PTSD  programs  and  other  psychiatric  services  the  VA  has  SPECTER,  BOB STUMP EVANS,  provided  over  the  years  to  help  veterans  cope  with  the  symptoms  of  this  debilitating  disorder.  The  study  is  to  be  conducted  by  an  independent  contractor,  but  the  VA  is  being  encouraged to design the study protocol  itself  in  order  to  secure  high  quality  responses to the survey.  Mr.  President,  in  closing,  I  want  to  acknowledge  the  work  of  our  Committee\u2019s  Chairman,  Senator  in  developing  this  comprehensive  legislation.  Through  his  efforts,  and  that  of  his  staff\u2014Bill  Turek,  Staff  Director;  Chris  Yoder,  Assistant  Staff  Director;  and  Legislative  Assistants  Jon  Tower  and William Cahill, we are moving this  significant piece of legislation today.  I  appreciate  the  willingness  of  the  House Committee  on Veterans\u2019 Affairs,  especially  Chairman  and  Ranking Member LANE to work  together  to  reach  compromise  on  so  many vital issues.  And  I would be  remiss  if  I did not acknowledge  the  efforts  of  my  own  staff:  Jim  Gottlieb,  Minority  Staff  Director;  Kim  Lipsky,  Professional  Staff  Member;  and  Mary  Schoelen,  Counsel.  I  am  enormously  grateful  for  their  diligence, and for their commitment to the  work  we  do  in  this  Committee  on  behalf of our Nation\u2019s veterans.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Without  objection,  the  amendment  (No.  4314)  is  agreed to.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The  Senate  concurs  in  the  amendment  of  the  House  to  the  title  of  the  bill  with  an  amendment.

By 2010  Social  Security  retirement  benefit  claims are  expected  to  rise  by  16  percent  and  disability  claims  by  47  percent.  For  an  agency facing  a  substantial  number  of  retirements  in its  own  workforce  and  high  expectations  from customers,  that\u2019s a great  challenge. It may  come  as  a  surprise  to  both  Congress and  to  Americans  that  part  of  Social  Security is  not  wholly  separated  from  the  federal  budget,  but  it  is  not.  The  administrative  costs  of running  the  agency  and  paying  benefits  are subject  to  discretionary  spending  caps\u2014an on-budget  restraint  that  could  keep  that  agency  from  preparing  for  the  challenge  it  will  soon face  as  the  baby  boomers  retire  and  disability cases  soar. Subjecting  the  agency\u2019s  administrative  funding  to  the  caps  really  doesn\u2019t  make  sense. After  all,  these  costs  are  paid  for  with  workers\u2019 payroll  taxes  from  the  Social  Security  Trust Fund\u2014they  are  not  paid  for  with  general  revenues.  When  these  payroll  taxes  are  used  to pay  benefits,  they  are  considered  off  budget and  not  subject  to  the  caps.  But  when  the exact  same  payroll  taxes  are  used  to  pay  the administrative  costs  that  support  benefit  payments,  they are  treated differently. Mr.  Speaker,  my  bill  creates  a  new  cap  for SSA\u2019s administrative appropriations  for  the  two remaining  years  the  caps  exist.  This  is  not  unprecedented.  Congress  felt  that  Social  Security\u2019s  responsibility  to  do  Continuing  Disability Reviews  was  so  important,  that  it  exempted those  management  costs  many  years  ago. Since  no  caps  exist  after  fiscal  year  2002,  Social  Security  administrative  expenses  will  then go off-budget  like  the  rest of  the program. However,  to  insure  the  public  gets  the  service  they  paid  for,  my  legislation  still  requires the  Social  Security  Administration  to  go through  the  appropriations  process  and  to  defend  that  request  to  both  the  appropriations and authorizing  committees. Each  year,  new  funding  requests  will  be  reviewed  based  upon  the  Commissioner\u2019s  documentation  that  current  and  future  tax  dollars are  meeting  the  mission  and  performance  levels  contained  in  the  Agency\u2019s  Strategic  Plan and  Annual  Performance  Plan.  Open  ended funding  without  results  is  not  an  option.  Continued  delivery  of  world-class  service,  along with  ongoing  progress  on  eliminating  waste, fraud, and abuse will be demanded  first. I  also  want  the  Social  Security  Administration  to  be  a  fully  integrated  member  of  the new  information  age,  so  my  bill  provides  for technology  investment.  The  agency  must  submit  a  comprehensive  procurement  plan  detailing  the  benefits,  risks  and  returns  from  the  investment.  This  plan  will  be  updated  biannually and  GAO  will  provide  the  Congress  with  their assessment  and  recommendation  on  SSA\u2019s performance  to guide our  funding decisions. The  way  to  prepare  Social  Security  for  the future  is  to  start  now. We  have  committed  ourselves  to  saving  Social  Security.  Just  as  important  must  be  our  commitment  to  save  the underlying  program  operation  so  critical  in  delivering  the  service  needed  by  retirees,  individuals with disabilities, and  their  families. Mr.  Speaker,  I  want  to  thank  my  Ways  and Means  colleague,  Mr.  for  joining  me as  an  original  sponsor  of  this  bill  and  note  that this  represents  another  bipartisan  effort  to CARDIN,  strengthen  the  Social  Security  program  for current  and  future  retirees.  I  urge  all  my  colleagues  to  cosponsor  this  important,  bipartisan legislation. THE  GREATEST  GENERATION HON.  HELEN  CHENOWETH-HAGE OF IDAHO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES want  them  to  know  the  depth Wednesday, October 11, 2000 Mrs.  CHENOWETH-HAGE.  Mr.  Speaker, most  of  America\u2019s  soldiers  are  just  ordinary people.  They  are  people  from  all  walks  of  life who  are  sometimes  asked  to  do  extraordinary things.  Those  of  us  who  haven\u2019t  served  in  the armed  forces  will  never  know  the  pain  they suffer  or  the  hardships  they  can  be  asked  to endure. However,  I  do  of our gratitude. For  this  reason,  I\u2019m  happy  to  share  with  my colleagues  a  speech  by  Kootenai  County Commissioner  Ron  Rankin  entitled  \u2018\u2018The Greatest  Generation,\u2019\u2019  which  emphasizes  the sacrifices  made  by  the  World  War  II  generation.  He  calls  them  this  because  they  lived  up to  the  challenges  forced  upon  them  by  both our  country\u2019s  worst  depression  and  our  greatest war. Commissioner  Rankin  knows  the  sacrifices made  by  this  generation.  He  learned  this  as  a Marine  fighting  the  Communists  and  the  violent  seas  at  Incheon,  Korea.  We  can  never thank  this  generation  enough,  but  I  would  like to  express  my  heartfelt  gratitude  to  both  Commissioner  Rankin  and  the  American  servicemen  who  so  bravely  served  our  country.  They met  the  challenges  forced  upon  them  in  our country\u2019s hour of need. Mr.  Speaker,  in  closing  I  commend  the  example  of  Ron  Rankin  to  my  colleagues,  and hereby  submit  to  the  for  their  consideration  \u2018\u2018The Greatest Generation\u2019\u2019  speech. RECORD GREATEST GENERATION (By Ron Rankin) Fellow  Veterans\u2014Families  and  Friends  of the  Greatest  Generation:  In  December  of 1776,  just  five  months  after  the  Declaration of  Independence  had  been  signed  and  the thirteen colonies were swept up in the American  Revolution,  Thomas  Paine  wrote, \u2018\u2018These  are  the  times  that  try  men\u2019s  souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he  that  stands now deserves the  love  and  thanks  of  all men  and women.\u2019\u2019 We . . . American\u2019s  greatest  generation . . . are  gathered  here  today  to  remember all of  those great patriots who  stood  fast and  held  the  line  against  tyranny,  from  the bridge at Concord to the sands of the Persian Gulf,  and  to  say  thank  you . . . for  without their  courage,  their  dedication  and  their willingness  to  die  for  what  was  right,  we would not be here today. I  didn\u2019t  serve  in  the Navy  but many  of my Marine  Corps  brothers  would  not  be  here today were  it not  for Navy  ships bombarding the  beaches  before  the  troops  landed . . . and  for  the  ships  that  shelled  the enemy  lines . . . directed by  forward observers on  the ground\u2014miles  from  the  ships  that targeted the enemy with surgical precision. Fifty  years  ago  this  very  week,  I  climbed down  the  nets  at  the  Incheon  Landing  executed  by  the  Navy,  fighting  30-foot  tides,  a landing  which  became  an  epic  in  Navy  and Marine Corps history. Until  Korea,  my  first-hand  knowledge  of the  Navy  was  troop  ships,  LST\u2019s  and  LCT\u2019s. Later  in  Korea,  two  regiments  of  the  First Marine Division were  completely  surrounded by  over  100  thousand  Chinese  troops  on  the top of icy mountains at the Chosin reservoir, 78  miles  from  the  sea. . . Ten  divisions  of Chinese  troops  had  determined  to  annihilate our Division. We  survived,,  thanks  in part  to the constant, dawn to dark napalming of our perimeters  by  fighters  many  from  carriers off  the  coast . . . keeping  the  Communist troops  at  bay  while  we  regrouped  for\u2014our bloody fight to the sea. My  fellow  Marines  and  I\u2014members  of  the \u2018\u2018Chosin  Few\u2019\u2019\u2014owe  an  everlasting  debt  of gratitude  to  the  heroes  of  the  United  States Navy  for  our  survival. . . Our  bond  with  the Navy was sealed on October 14, 1989 when the guided missile cruiser USS Chosin was christened. Others we  remember  today  died  so  that we might  enjoy  life,  liberty  and  the  pursuit  of happiness. Their  legacy carries with  it a  tremendous  burden\u2014the  responsibility  to  so live  our  lives  that  we  may  hold  inviolate that  for  which  we  bravely  fought  and  for which so many gave their lives . . . our freedom. Freedoms  won  on  distant  battlefields  and on distant seas can be lost in an instant here at  home  if  we  fail  to  carry  on  the  fight against tyranny. No  one  knows  better  than  a  Veteran  that service  to  America  does  not  end  when  you come home  from war. We  fought  for  freedom and  we\u2019ve  seen  our  friends  die  for  freedom, but in spite of the great sacrifices of our fallen patriots of the past, we have become a nation morally adrift\u2014without compass or rudder,  sacrificing  the  generations  we  fought and died for to an enemy we cannot see. In  our  wars,  fought  on  the  seas  and  on  the fields  of  battle,  the  enemy  sailed  great  warships,  he  wore  uniforms  and  carried  weapons\u2014rifles,  bayonets,  grenades\u2014he was  identifiable  and  we  were  armed  and  trained  to recognize  and  defeat  him  and  defeat  him  we did! Today,  another  insidious  enemy  is  already on  our  shores  striking  at  the  very  soul  of America.  This  enemy  does  not  wear  a  uniform  or  fight with  great  ships  at  sea  or with bayonets  or  grenades . . . or  sneak  attack our fleets at anchor. He is among us. He uses our  media  to  desensitize  us  against  threats from abroad . . . to  lull us  to  sleep  to  facilitate  future  Pearl  Harbors.  He  prays  on  the carnal  desires  of  our  communities.  He  pollutes  our  children\u2019s  minds  with  filth  and their  bodies  with  drugs.  He  has  taken  God out  of  our  institutions  and  desecrates  our flag  with  the  approval  of  our  government. There  are  no  distant  drums  of  war  signaling this  peril\u2014no  Pearl  Harbors,  no  foxholes, trenches,  bayonets  or  grenades  in  this  war. The  ammunition  is  knowledge,  which  we must all continue to seek . . . and the battle is  being  fought  in  the  city  halls,  the  courthouses, the legislatures, and in the Congress, to  rebuild  our  decaying  military,  to  return dignity and respect to our men and women in uniform living on food stamps. I  say  to  you  here  today,  you  patriots  and protectors of our progeny and their heritage, as  Patrick  Henry  stated,  \u2018\u2018the  enemy  is  in the field . . . why stand we here idle?\u2019\u2019 Thank  God  we  survived  the  wars.  Thank God  that  our  fallen  buddies . . . patriots all . . . cared  enough  about  our  country  and its  future  that  they  laid  down  their  lives  to preserve  it,  and  thank  God  that  with  His help,  we  may  have  the  strength  and  determination  to  carry  on  and  make  this  again the  \u2018\u2018One  Nation  Under  God\u2019\u2019  for  which  we served  and  our  buddies  died.  It  is  a  tremendous  responsibility,  but  we  owe  it  to  them and to future generations.

RECOGNITION  OF  BILL  CHENEY, NEWLY  ELECTED  DIRECTOR  ON THE  BOARD  OF  THE  NATIONAL ASSOCIATION  OF  FEDERAL CREDIT  UNIONS HON.  HENRY  BONILLA OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, October 11, 2000 Mr.  BONILLA.  Mr.  Speaker,  today  I  recognize  Bill  Cheney,  the  President  and  CEO  of Xerox  Federal  Credit  Union,  headquartered  in El  Segundo,  California,  for  his  recent  election to  the  board  of  the  National  Association  of Federal  Credit  Unions  (NAFCU).  I  have  had the  pleasure  of  knowing  Bill  for  over  16  years, many  of  which  he  spent  in  my  congressional district  at  Security  Service  Federal  Credit Union  in San Antonio,  Texas. During  that  time, we  spent  many  years  working  together  on issues  that  affect  the  citizens  of  the  23rd  Congressional  District  of  Texas.  Bill  also  shares my  life-long  commitment  to  supporting  all  athletes at  the University of Texas at Austin. Even  though  Bill  left  San  Antonio  to  become President  and  CEO  at  Xerox  Federal  Credit Union,  he  continues  to  keep  me  updated  on credit  union  views.  He  even  makes  it  back  to Texas  from  time  to  time  to  visit  Xerox  Federal Credit  Union  offices.  Xerox  Federal  Credit Union,  which  has  over  73,000  members, serves  employees  of  Xerox  Corporation  and related  companies  nationwide  through  16 credit  union  offices  in  9  states  including  California, New York,  Illinois, and Texas. His  election  to  the  NAFCU  board  culminates 15  years  of  dedicated  work  in  the  credit  union industry.  I  congratulate  my  friend  Bill  Cheney on  his  recent  election  to  the  NAFCU  Board and  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work  with him  and  America\u2019s  credit  unions.  I  know  Bill will  be  an  outstanding  voice  for  credit  unions everywhere. SUPREME  COURT  SECURITY  OF  2000 ACT SPEECH OF HON.  SHEILA  JACKSON-LEE OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, October 10, 2000 Ms.  JACKSON-LEE  of  Texas.  Mr.  Speaker, as  indicated  by  my  colleague,  H.R.  5136 would  make  permanent  the  authority  of  the U.S.  Supreme  Court  Police  to  provide  security for  its  Justices,  Court  employees,  and  official visitors  on  and  off  the  Supreme  Court grounds.  The U.S. Supreme Court Police were first  authorized  by  Congress  to  carry  firearms and  protect  court  personnel  and  visitors  outside  Supreme  Court  grounds  in  1982.  The statutory  authorization was  scheduled  to  terminate  on  December  29,  1985.  In  December 1985,  the  Congress  extended  such  authorization  and  has  done  so  five  additional  times  in the  subsequent  years.  The  last  extension  occurred  in  October  1996,  and  is  set  to  expire December 29, 2000. It  is  clear  that  the  security  concerns  which gave  rise  to  the  original  authorization,  including  threats  of  violence  against  the  Justices and  the  Court,  will  continue  for  the  foreseeable  future.  In  addition,  I  am  not  aware  of  any suggestion  or  concern  that  the  U.S.  Supreme Court  Police  has  misused  its  authority,  or should  not  be  entitled  to  such  authority  on  a permanent basis. In  fact  the  evidence  suggests  that  the  U.S. Supreme  Court  Police  has  discharged  its  responsibilities  in  an  efficient  and  cost  effective manner.  For  example,  the  cost  of  the  program has  been  minimal.  The  Supreme  Court  Police work  closely  with  the  U.S.  Marshal\u2019s  office  to provide  security  for  Supreme  Court  Justices when  they  travel  outside  the  Washington,  DC, metropolitan  area.  Over  the  past  4  years, there were  74  requests  for Supreme Court Police  protection  beyond  the  D.C.  metropolitan area  at  a  total  cost  of  $16,855,  or  $4,214  per year. In  light  of  continuing  security  concerns,  and the  Supreme  Court  Police\u2019s  record  of  providing  appropriate  protection  over  the  past  18 years  for  the  Justices,  Court  employees,  and official  visitors,  I  support  making  the  Supreme Court  Polices  authorization  to  provide  security on  and  off  Supreme  court  grounds  permanent. As  a  result,  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support the bill. A  TRIBUTE  TO  GAIL  WEISS HON.  BENJAMIN  A.  GILMAN OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, October 11, 2000 Mr.  GILMAN.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  pleased  to join  with  my  colleagues  this  evening  to  recognize  the  long,  distinguished  career  of  Gail Weiss.  Gail,  who  serves  so  ably  now  as  the Minority  Staff  Director  on  the  Committee  on Education  and  the  Workforce,  and  before  that as Staff Director of  that Committee, had earlier served  as  Staff  Director  of  our  Committee  on Post  Office  and  Civil  Service,  chaired  by  my good  colleague,  the  gentleman  from  Missouri, Mr.  CLAY.  Serving  as  the  Ranking  Minority Member  of  the  Post  Office  Committee  at  that time,  I  had  the  opportunity  to work  closely with Gail.  I  found  her  to  be  a  true  professional  and I  appreciated  the  time  she  took  to  listen  to  our positions  on  various  issues  before  our  Committee. We will  surely miss  having Gail\u2019s  experience and  institutional  memory  upon  which  to  rely. Gail  is  one  of  a  dwindling  corps  of  staff  who have  the  ability  to  put  the  measures  before  us into  the  perspective  of  earlier  legislation  enacted  to  address  important  issues.  Her  expertise  on  postal  and  civil  service  issues  and those  before  the  Committee  on  Education  and the  Workforce  have  helped  us  to  develop  legislative  initiatives  that  address  these  issues  in an effective manner. I  am  certain  that  Gail  will  continue  to  be  active  in  a  number  of  areas  that  are  of  keen  interest  to  her.  I  know  that  our  colleagues  will also  continue  to  reach  out  to  her  for  her thoughts  on  key  matters  that  we  deal  with  in the  Congress.  I\u2019ve  certainly  become  fond  of both  Gail  and  her  husband  Jack  and  wish them  great  success,  happiness,  and  good health  as  they  enter  this  new  and  rewarding time  in  their  lives. TRIBUTE  TO  ITALIAN  GARDENS RESTAURANT HON.  KAREN  McCARTHY OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, October 11, 2000 Ms.  MCCARTHY  of  Missouri.  Mr.  Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay  tribute  to  a  Kansas City, Missouri  family  tradition.  Seventy-five  years  ago  a small,  family  owned  business  established  its roots  in  the  heart  of  Kansas  City.  Today,  the Italian  Gardens  Restaurant  is  a  well  established  and  celebrated  Kansas  City  landmark and popular eatery. The  late  John  Bondon,  Sr.,  first  opened  the Italian  Gardens  Restaurant  in  1925  with  his nephew  Frank  Lipari.  It  was  a  difficult  time  for the  partners  and  most  of  the  country  as  the economy  collapsed  and  a  world  war  became a  reality.  Despite  these  challenges  Italian  Gardens  persevered  and  in  1933  the  restaurant was  able  to  move  to  its  current  location  at 1110  Baltimore  with  the  help  of  a  $1,500  loan from  a  waitress.  John  Bondon  and  Frank Lipari  owned  only  one  new  pair  of  shoes  worn by  whomever  was  working  with  the  public  in the  front  of  the  restaurant.  When  America  entered  World  War  II,  the  Italian  Gardens  recognized  the  anti-Italian  sentiments  present  at  this time  and was  forced  to  temporarily  change  the name  of  the  restaurant  to  \u2018\u2018The  Gardens.\u2019\u2019  The restaurant  was  available  for  dinner  only  since many  of  the  staff  was  working  in  the  defense industry. Over  the  past  75  years,  the  Italian  Gardens has  spanned  five  generations  of  family  proprietorship  and  attracted  a  large  and  loyal  following of patrons. The  restaurant has attracted a  diverse  crowd  of  customers  such  as  Joe  Di Maggio,  Katherine  Hepburn,  Frank  Sinatra, Liberace,  and  the  famed  outlays  Bonnie Parker  and  Clyde  Barrow.  For  seventy-five years  the  Italian  Gardens  has  been  known  by businessmen,  artists,  athletes,  and  neighbors to  be  a  large  community  table  and  gathering place  where  everyone  is  made  to  feel  welcome and part of  the  family. Throughout  their  rich  heritage  the  Italian Gardens  Restaurant  has  been  a  significant charitable  and  civic  contributor  to  our  community,  including  lending  the  talents  and  expertise  of  its  executives  to  critical  boards  and commissions  benefitting  the  Greater  Kansas City  Area.  The  Italian  Gardens  family  includes the  now  retired  Carl  DiCapo,  John  Bondon, president  of  the  restaurant  company,  and great-nephew  of  the  original  co-founder, Bondon\u2019s  mother,  Carolyn  Berbiglia,  Bondon\u2019s wife,  Vicki,  and  his  daughter  Bianca.  The Italian Gardens  is  a Kansas City  landmark  that has  served  as  a model  of  success  in  our  community.  It  is  one  of  the  few  longtime  family owned  operations  still  present  in  our  region. This  cherished  local  eatery  has  established  a standard  of  excellence  that  will  continue  to  be celebrated  for  years  to  come. Mr.  Speaker,  please  join  me  in  congratulating  the  Italian  Gardens  Restaurant  family  as it  celebrates  seventy-five  years  of  service  to the Kansas City  community.

My  local  community  cannot  meet  the  match.  I  have been  getting  all  the  monies  for  the studies,  everything  the  Army  Corps  of Engineers  has  done.  But  I  think  we need  relief  to  those  upper  systems  who are  continuing  to  contaminate  those systems we clean up. I  say  to  the  gentlemen  from  Florida, Mr.  and  Mr.  congratulations, and I hope they will help me in the  future  to  eliminate  or  reduce  the local  match  for  impacted  areas  like ours  that  cannot  afford  to  clean  up those contaminated rivers. Mr.  GOSS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  SHAW),  the  distinguished  chairman  of  the  Florida  delegation,  a  man to  whom  many  nice  and  well-deserved compliments  have  been  paid  in  getting us to this point. (Mr.  SHAW  asked  and  was  given  permission  to  revise  and  extend  his  remarks.) Mr.  SHAW. Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the gentleman for yielding time to me, and I  very  much  appreciate  the  work  of this great body. Mr.  Speaker,  as  extraordinary  as  it has  been  to  see  traditional  adversaries come together this year on comprehensive  Everglades  restoration  legislation contained  in  the  Water  Resources  Development Act, something else  is going on  here  which  I  think  is  very  special and  I  think  is  very  worthwhile  noting. Skeptics  have  been  saying,  and  they have been at our heels  in recent weeks, we will  not  get  it  done.  To  them  I  say, we  will.  Some  have  gone  around  the country  saying  a  Republican  Congress cannot work with a Democrat administration  to  produce  good  policy  for  the American  people. We  have  and we will. Others  have  lost  patience  and  doubted our  ability  to  lead  and  get  this  done  in this  short  span  of  time.  Well,  we  have proven them wrong, also. The  fact  is  this:  When  both  parties come  to  the  table  with  sincere  goodfaith  efforts  to  get  something  done without  hidden  agendas  and  with  eyes towards  the  next  generation  and  not just  the  next  election,  building  upon relationships  of  good  will,  not  destroying them, we can do good things for our country and for the entire globe. We  all  recognize  the  importance  of this  legacy,  not  only  on  the  land  and water,  but  on  the  people  who  live  in Florida  and  visit  this  national  treasure,  and  want  to  make  sure  that  it  is there for future generations. My  colleagues  know,  I  have  worked my  entire  career  and  will  continue  to work  to  build  bridges  across  the  aisle. There  is  no  better  example  of  doing that,  as  I  am  looking  at  my  colleague, the  gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr. and  looking  at my  colleague, the  gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr. GOSS),  whose  congressional  districts share  the  Everglades,  to  say  that  this is certainly a very fine moment. I have offered  several bills on  the  environment, but none makes me prouder DEUTSCH)  to  have  my  name  on  it  than  the  comprehensive  Everglades  restoration  bill, because  I  have  been  looking  after  this piece  of  my  backyard  for  my  entire life. I  am  eager  to  see  this  legislation pass,  not  because  the  base  Everglades bill  has  my  name  on  it,  but  because  it is  the  right  thing  to  do  and  because  a broad  cross-section  of  Americans  have put  their  support  and  their  hard  work into getting us to this day. I  urge  the  passage  of  this  resolution, this  rule, and also push  for  the passage of the underlying bill. Mr. GOSS. Mr. Speaker,  I am pleased to  yield  3  minutes  to  another  distinguished  gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr. FOLEY),  my  friend  and  colleague  from the  east  coast,  who  also  has  been  very instrumental  in  pulling  all  the  parties together  in  an  amicable  way  to  reach this solution. Mr. FOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me, and I thank the gentleman for bringing this rule  to  the  floor.  Of  course,  I  urge  all Members  to  support  this  very  important  landmark  legislation.  It  is  one  of the proudest moments  that  I will probably have here on the floor is to see the Florida  delegation  unanimous  on  an issue of importance to our State and to our Nation. Many  people  look  at  the  Everglades and  say  it  is  Florida\u2019s  issue,  it  is  Florida\u2019s  problem.  But  it  is  America\u2019s crown  jewel.  It  is  something  we  share not  only  with  ourselves  as  natives  of Florida,  but  also  those  45-plus  million visitors  who  come  to  Florida  for  the pristine  wonderment  of  whether  it  be our  oceans,  our  Everglades,  our  Keys, or our panhandle. Marjory  Stoneman  Douglas  penned  a novel,  the  River  of  Grass,  about  the wonders  of  the Everglades. Back  in  the thirties  when  candidates  were  running for  office,  one  notably  Mr.  Broward, who  became  Governor,  used  to  say  the slogan,  elect  me  Governor  and  I  will drain  that  swamp,  known  as  the  Everglades, so we will have development. How wrong they were then, how right we  are  today,  to  reverse  decades  of abuse and neglect of our national park; to  start  paving  the  way,  if  you  will, and  maybe  that  is  not  the  correct  expression,  paving  the  way,  but  creating the  dynamics  by  which  we  can  reengineer  Florida\u2019s  multitude  of  plumbing projects  in  order  to  make  the  Everglades  once  again  the  clean  and  pristine waterway and natural habitat that it is and should be. The  delegation  has  been  led  by  so many  champions,  too  many  to  mention,  back  in  the  days  of  the  governorship  of  now  Senator, MACK, and others. We  are  truly  a  bipartisan  State  as  it relates  to  the  Everglades.  Lawton Chiles,  in  his  memory,  would  be  so proud today to know after the years he served  as  our  chief  executive  that  one of his greatest efforts  is now coming to fruition. The  chairman  of  Florida\u2019s  delegation was  mentioned.  There  is  a  lot  to  be GRAHAM,  CONNIE BOB mySHUSTER)  yield and  I said  for  seniority  in  this  process.  The 20 years  of  the  gentleman  from Florida (Mr.  SHAW)  of  service  to  Floridians,  to those  in  Dade,  Broward,  and  Palm Beach  County,  the  hallmark  of  his  20year  tenure  here,  results  in  this  bill being  brought  to  the  floor  because  he pleaded  with  the  Speaker  and  all  parties  at  the  table,  with  the  gentleman from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.  and others,  to  make  sure  that  this  bill  became  the  final  act  of  this  final  hour  of the 106th Congress. What  a  tribute  and  what  a  legacy  to his  grandchildren,  13  I  believe  now  in number,  maybe  11,  two  to  come,  13 soon  will  know  that  their  grandpoppy made  possible  this  historic  day  on  a Friday before we adjourn and return to our constituencies in Florida. So  I  salute  every  Member,  Democrat and  Republican,  in  our  delegation, every person who will vote for this bill, and I urge, I hope, a unanimous acceptance of the fact that we take on the national  responsibility  of  our  national park,  the  Everglades,  by  signalling  to the  world  we  are  prepared  to  lead,  we are  prepared  to  clean  up  our  act,  and we  are  prepared  to  make  it  the  great park that it truly is. Mr.  FROST.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  back  the  balance  of  my  time,  urge adoption of this rule. Mr.  GOSS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  self such time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  I  just  wanted  to  point out,  I  see  my  friend,  the  gentleman from  Florida  (Mr.  who  did not  speak  on  this.  I  have  been  privileged  to  have  worked  with  him  for  a number  of  years  on  this,  back  and forth.  The  gentleman  from  Florida  has the  front  door,  I  have  the  back  door. Most  people  prefer  to  go  in  the  front door, but the back door is equally good. We  have  gotten  along  very,  very  well over the years. I  think  of  the  number  of  days  I  have actually  been  in  the  Everglades  with I  remember  an  occasion where  I  stood  on  the  banks  of  the  then straight  Kissimmee  Channel,  and  he said, we are going to put some wrinkles back  in  this.  He  got  a  truck,  and  we started  pouring  dirt  back  into  the channel.  I  thought,  this  has  got  to  be against the law. We are all going to end up in deep trouble. All  of  these  programs  that  have taken  so  many  people  so  much  vision to  work  out  the  formula  to  get  all  of the  interested  parties  going  in  the same direction have been referred to  in this  discussion.  It  is  an  extraordinary story,  and  I  hope  some  day  somebody will  write  the  book.  It  will  be  a  wonderful  book  about  what  Americans  can do  in  this  country  when  they  work  together. I  am  very  pleased  to  express  my strong support for this good piece of bipartisan  legislation, and  I urge support for the rule. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my  time,  and  I  move  the  previous question on the resolution. The previous question was ordered. DEUTSCH),  GRAHAM.

The  proposed  project  is  intended  to  result  in  a restoration  of  the  area  into  a  new  urban greenbelt  corridor,  comparable  to  such  places as San Antonio\u2019s Riverwalk. I  want  to  thank  my  colleague,  Representative  her  staff  and  the  committee  for  their  help  in  securing  this  project.  I am  confident  that  this  important  project  will  restore  wildlife  habitat,  allow  for  natural  tidal flows,  but  will  also  provide  for  a  new  significant  recreational  attraction  and  create  jobs  in small businesses  surrounding  the  lake area. Mr.  FOSSELLA.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  very pleased  that  we  are  adopting  today  the  Water Resources  Development  Act  of  2000  (WRDA). This  important  bill  includes  authorization  of  50foot  deepening  projects  for  all  of  the  major channels  in  the  Port  of  New  York  and  New Jersey  (the  \u2018\u2018Port\u2019\u2019)\u2014including  the  Arthur  Kill Channel.  These  deepening  projects  are  critical to  the  port\u2019s  ability  to  handle  the  larger  ships that  are  now  calling  on  ports  throughout  the world.  This  deepening  will  enable  the  Port  to remain  competitive  with  other  ports  already equipped  with  deeper  drafts  and  help  to  maintain  and  enhance  our  region  as  a  hub  for international  trade. The  Port  is  the  largest  container  port  on  the east  coast,  moving  more  than  2.3  million TEU\u2019s  of  containers  annually  and  directly  serving  over  35  percent  of  the  U.S.  population.  As a  result  of  its  strategic  location  in  the  middle of  one  of  the  nation\u2019s  largest  and most  affluent consumer  markets,  the  Port  provides  same day  delivery  of  goods  to  more  than  18  million people.  Over  the  next  10  years,  cargo  volumes  in  the  Port  are  expected  to  double  and over  the  next  40  years,  quadruple.  The  new generation  of  cargo  ships  will  require  greater depths  to  accommodate  their  enormous  size and  container  capacity.  Some  portions  of  the Port  are  currently  too  shallow  to  accommodate most  modern  container  and  military  ships. Given  the  increased  competition  from  other ports,  especially  Halifax  which  has  depths  of 60  to  70  feet,  this  comprehensive  deepening of  the Port  is  imperative. This  project  has  enjoyed  the  support  of  the New  York  and New  Jersey  delegations  as well as  the  Governors  of  both  states.  I\u2019d  like  to thank  Chairman  Subcommittee Chairman  and  Ranking  Member for all of  their hard work on  this  crucial  bill.  I  commend  all  of  my  colleagues  for coming  together  to  pass  this  bill  important  not only  to  Staten  Island  and  Brooklyn,  but  to  our Nation as a whole. Mrs.  MEEK  of  Florida.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask unanimous  consent  to  revise  and  extend  my remarks.  I  rise  today  in  support  of  the  Water Resources  Development  Act  Conference  Report,  in  particular,  the  section  on  the  restoration  of  the  Everglades.  We  are  on  the  verge of  passing  historic  legislation  to  restore  America\u2019s Everglades. Mr.  Speaker,  the  Everglades  are  dying.  All of  us  know  that  we  must  act  now  or  we  lose what  is  left  of  the  Everglades  within  a  few years.  No  one  disputes  that  the  Federal  Government  is  largely  responsible  for  the  damage that  was  done  to  the  Everglades.  Fifty  years ago,  the  Federal  Government  established  the Everglades  National  Park  but  simultaneously, a  series  of  canals,  levees  and  other  flood  control  structures  constructed  by  the  Southern and  Central  Florida  Project  disrupted  the  lifeSHUSTER,  BOEHLERT OBERSTAR of  flow  clean Everglades\u2014the  blood  of  the  fresh water. As  a  result  of  these  50  years  of  neglect  and abuse,  the  State  of  Florida  has  lost  46  percent of  its  wetlands  and  50  percent  of  its  historic Everglades  ecosystem.  Sixty-eight  plant  and animal  species  have  become  threatened  or endangered  with  extinction  while  urban  and agricultural  runoff  have  produced  extensive water  quality  degradation  throughout  the  region. The  Federal  Government  has  a  clear  interest  in  restoring  this  ecosystem  since  a  large portion  of  the  lands  owned  or managed  by  the Federal  Government  will  receive  the  benefits of  the  restoration\u20144 national parks and 16 national  wildlife  refuges  which  make  up  half  of the  remaining  Everglades.  The  need  for  action is  clear.  That  is  why  I  am  so  pleased  that  we are  coming  together  to  solve  this problem. The legislation  before  us  today  represents  an  unprecedented  compromise  supported by  the administration,  the  State  of  Florida,  environmental  groups,  farmers,  home  builders,  water utilities,  Indian  tribes  and  industry.  These  diverse  groups  represent  every  major  constituency  involved  in  the  Everglades  restoration. And  they  are  all  on  board.  Not  because  they all  got  what  they  wanted,  but  because  they  all understood  the  urgency  of  passing  this  legislation  to  save America\u2019s Everglades. Mr.  Speaker,  America  desperately  needs this  bill.  I  urge  all  my  colleagues  to  join  me  to preserve  America\u2019s  Everglades  and  to  ensure that  one  of  the  world\u2019s  most  endangered  ecosystems  is not  lost. Mr.  STUPAK.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  grateful that  the  Senate  has  recognized  the  need  to protect  the  Great  Lakes  water  from  diversion and  export.  Yesterday,  the  other  body  passed legislation  that  focuses  on  protecting  this  precious  resource  from  foreign  companies  and countries  who  target  the  Great  Lakes  for  their fresh, drinking water. The Great  Lakes  is  the  largest  body  of  fresh water,  containing  more  than  20  percent  of  the planet\u2019s  fresh  water,  and  is  the  primary  source of  drinking  water  for  millions  of  people.  These lakes,  however,  are  being  targeted  outside  the continent  because  the  global  water  demand  is doubling  every  21  years.  The World  Bank  predicts  that  by  the  year  2025, more  than  3  billion people  in  52  countries  will  suffer  water  shortages  for drinking or  sanitation. Unfortunately,  this  legislation  does  not  go far  enough  to  ensure  a  federal  role  in  protecting  the Great Lakes  from  such  threats. The language  passed  by  the  Senate  is  nonbinding and  thus  does  not  ensure  a  role  for  the  Secretary  of  State  or  any  other  federal  official  or agency  in  devising  and  approving  water  conservation  standards  for  the  region. Despite  opposing  arguments,  water  diversion  from  the  Great  Lakes  must  involve  the federal  government.  Notably,  only  the  federal government  may  enter  into  treaties  with  the Canadian  government.  Only  the  federal  government  may  devise  a  uniform  national  policy on  diversions.  And,  only  the  federal  government  may  set  and  enforce  policies  on  international  waters  that  apply  to  four  of  the  five Great  Lakes.  The  federal  government\u2019s  role  in this  issue  is  clearly  delineated  and  it  must maintain  a  strong  involvement  to  prevent  future diversions. This  entire  issue  was  spurred  in  1998  when a  Canadian  company  planned  to  ship  3  billion liters  of water  from  Lake Superior  over  5  years and  sell  it  to  Asia.  That  same  year  I  authored legislation,  that  the  House  of  Representatives passed,  urging  the  United  States  government to  oppose  this  action.  While  the  permit  was subsequently  withdrawn,  the  House  passage of  my  resolution  could  not  stop  future  requests.  In  fact,  the  United  States  cannot  stop diversions  and  withdrawals  in  Great  Lakes water  that  is under  the  control of Canada. Obviously,  the  federal  governments  of  Canada  and  the United  States must  be  involved  to ensure  that  diversions  from  the  Great  Lakes do  not  occur.  The  legislation  that  passed  the Senate  yesterday  fails  to  include  such  a  protection.  It  encourages  the  Provinces  of Ontario and  Quebec  to  be  included  in  developing  conservation  standards.  But  even  if  they  are present  during  such  discussions,  their  contribution  is made  only  to  existing United  States federal  law,  not  to  that  of  Canadian  federal law.  Without  similar  restrictions  in  Canadian federal  law,  we  may  be  confronting  another company\u2019s  request  to  remove  Great  Lakes water  in  the  next  few  years.  We  cannot  risk this  real  threat. I  thank  the  Senate  for  its  consideration  of this  serious  issue  and  hope  that  the  next  Congress  may  better  protect  the  Great  Lakes  and the  35  million  people  who  live  within  its  basin. Ms.  BERKLEY.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  in strong  support  of  the  Water  Resource  Development  Act, which  includes  a  provision  to  help restore  Lake  Mead  and  the  Las  Vegas  Wash and Wetlands  in  southern Nevada. The  Las  Vegas  Wash  and  Wetlands  is  the only  major  drainage  channel  for  the  entire 1,600-square-mile  Las  Vegas  Valley.  On  average,  153  million  gallons  of  water,  including harmful  pollutants,  flow  each  day  through  the Las  Vegas Wash,  then  through  the  Las  Vegas Wetlands  eventually  draining  into  Lake  Mead, which  is  Las  Vegas  Valley\u2019s  primary  source  of drinking  water.  Fortunately,  the  Las  Vegas Wetlands  filter  out  harmful  pollutants  before they enter  into Lake Mead. In  1972,  the  Las  Vegas  Valley  had  135,552 people  and  2,000  acres  of  wetlands.  Today, the  Valley  has  over  1.2  million  people  and only  200  acres  of  wetlands  left.  The  Valley\u2019s tremendous  growth  has  severely  eroded  the Las  Vegas  Wash  and  Wetlands.  If  left  alone the  wetlands  will  disappear,  and  Lake  Mead will become badly polluted  resulting  in an environment  disaster  threatening  local  fish  and wildlife  species  and  the  health  of  area  residents. The  future  of  Lake Mead  and  the  Las Vegas Wash  is  the  future  of  our  community,  so  this is hugely  important  to  southern Nevada. I\u2019ve  grown  up  with  Lake  Mead  and  the Wash  and  I\u2019ve  seen  over  the  years  how they\u2019ve  become  more  and  more  polluted.  Not only  do  we  rely  on  Lake  Mead  and  the  Wash for  clean  drinking  water,  but  they  provide  one of  our  greatest  recreational  and  scenic  areas. If we want  our  children  to  continue  to  have  access  to  this  tremendous  asset,  we  have  to come  together  now  to  save  the  Lake  and  restore  the  fragile Wash. This  important  legislation  authorizes  $10 million  in  funding  for  the  implementation  of  a water  resources  plan  adopted  by  the  Las Vegas  Wash  Coordinating  Committee.  The plan  directs  federal,  state,  and  local  officials  to work  together  to  restore  the  wetlands  at  the Las  Vegas  Wash  and  to  improve  water  quality at  the Lake. Mr.  Speaker,  this  legislation  continued  growth  and  is  crucial  to  the environmental VerDate 03-NOV-2000 23:24 Nov 03, 2000 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\A03NO7.009 pfrm02 PsN: H03PT1 ",
            "22": "H11836 (cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:32) (cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68) (cid:208) (cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:83)(cid:69) November 3, 2000 by  issuing districts  done  by  school  school bonds. The  tradition  in  this  country  has been  for  this  Congress  to  help  school districts  issue  school  bonds  and  to  do so  by using  the Tax Code  for us  to  provide a subsidy to those who hold school bonds, so that investors will buy school bonds,  even  though  they  yield  a  rather low rate of interest. We have done this  in the past by providing  an  exemption  from  taxation  for all  of  the  interest  paid  on  school  bonds and  other municipal  bonds. We  need  to do more, because even when we exempt the  interest,  the  school  bonds  end  up having  to  yield  5  percent  or  6  percent and  many  school  districts  cannot  afford  to  pay  5  percent  or  6  percent.  So we on the Democratic side said we need to  provide  for  the  issuance  of  $25  billion worth of a new kind of school bond with  even  greater  benefits  under  the Federal  Tax  Code  and  even  lower  costs to the school district. We  did  not  design  to  bond  where  the interest  was  not  merely  tax  exempt, but  instead  the  school  district  did  not have  to  pay  interest  at  all,  but  the bond  holder,  instead  of  getting  even  a reduced  interest  payment  from  the school  district,  received  a  tax  credit for  holding  the  bond.  An  outstanding way  to  use  our  Tax  Code  to  turn  to school  districts  that  would  otherwise have  to  pay  $100,000  a  year  to  service  a particular  bond,  tell  them  they  can raise  that  same  amount  of  money, build  that  same  size  of  a  school  and only make annual payments of $66,000 a year,  a  greater  Federal  subsidy  for those  school  districts  that  issue  school bonds  to  renovate  and  build  new schools. We  thought  that  it  was  necessary  to provide this $25 billion of special aid to our  local  schools  over  a  2-year  period, roughly  $121\u20442 billion  a  year.  The  Republicans  decided  instead  to  provide per year less than half of what was necessary,  but  rather  to  provide  $5  billion a  year  over  3  years  on  a  per-year  basis less than half. They also, and this troubled me, weaseled  the  Davis-Bacon  provisions  so that  these  school  bonds  could  be  used to  build  substandard  schools  at  substandard  wages  for  those  building them.  We  do  not  need  slipshod  workmanship.  We  do  not  need  substandard schools.  We  do  not  need  to  weasel around  the  Davis-Bacon  action  that has  assured  that  our  public  buildings built  with  Federal  dollars  are  built well. Mr. Speaker, we have a very watereddown  version  of  the  Democratic  proposal, which  is  clearly  insufficient,  but what  is  worse  is  that  the  same  tax  bill which  came  before  this  House,  and which  most  of  us  on  this  side  voted against,  also  provided  for  another method  of  helping  school  districts,  a method  that  costs  the  Federal  Government well over $2 billion, but was actually worse than nothing. What was  this? How  do we  figure  out way  to  pretend  to  help  school  disa  tricts  and  actually  hurt  them?  We changed the arbitrage rules, or at  least the majority would  have  us  change  the arbitrage  rules  in  the  Tax  Code.  What are  those  rules? The  rules  say  this:  If a public  entity,  a  school,  a  city,  is  going to  issue  tax  exempt  bonds  for  a  public purpose,  they  need  to  use  the  money for that public purpose. This avoids the possibility  that  some  school  district would  issue a  lot of bonds at a real  low interest  rate,  so  they  borrow  money cheap. Instead of using the money for a public purpose,  they would  just use  the money to invest on Wall Street. We  have  arbitrage  rules  for  a  reason. That  is  if  the  Federal  Government  is going  to  subsidize  borrowing,  the  borrowing  should  be  for  something  like building  a  school,  not  building  a  portfolio. But  what  the  Republican  bill  would do  is  change  those  rules  and  identify that  change  as  our  way  of  helping school  districts,  a  special  encouragement  from  the  Federal  Government. Here,  school  districts,  is  how  we  are going  to  help  you.  How?  Issue  the bonds,  issue  tax  exempt  bonds.  We  are not  going  to  let  you  issue  those  credit bonds because those would help you too much.  The  Democrats  wanted  to  give you  that  much  help,  but  the  Republicans  want  to  provide  that  only  in very  small  quantity,  issue  regular  tax exempt  bonds,  pay  5  percent  or  6  percent  interest  and  then  take  the money to  Wall  Street.  We  are  sure  you  will earn  8  percent  or  9  percent  or  20  percent  or  80  percent  or  2000  percent  on your money, and you will be allowed to keep the profit. This  is  the  Republican  way  of  building schools, by building portfolios. This is  how  Orange  County,  California  went bankrupt a few years ago. We should be trying  to build a  school on Elm Street, not a skyscraper on Wall Street. We  should  not  be  turning  to  schools and  saying  we  will  not  provide  you with  adequate  help  to  issue  bonds  and use  the money  to  build  schools,  but we will  instead  encourage  you  to  issue bonds  and  use  the  money  to  play  the market. I  know  that  our  friends  on  Wall Street  would  prefer  that,  a  whole  new customer,  but  I  was  surprised  to  find the  real  impetus  for  this  proposal.  It comes from people I used to work with, the  tax  lawyers  who  are  subspecialists in tax exempt municipal bonds. Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  sympathetic  with them.  You  see,  I  was  a  tax  nerd  for  a lot  of  years.  For  over  a  dozen  years,  I practiced  tax  law,  and  after  a  day  of reading  the  most  complex  regulations printed  in  the  finest  print,  I  had  but one  solace,  one  joy,  one  redemption, and that was that my job was not quite as  boring  as  those  of  my  colleagues who  subspecialized  in  the  tax  law  of municipal bonds, even among tax nerds that is regarded as a boring job. 1200 So this tax provision that is stated to try  to  help  our  schools  was  in  essence designed  to  provide  excitement  to  tax bond  counsel,  to  say  they  are  not  just going  to  issue  bonds  and  build  schools and  deal  with,  frankly,  excessively complex  provisions  in  doing  it;  but  instead they are going to issue bonds and then,  with  the  members  of  the  school board,  go  play  the  market  with  the money. Mr.  Speaker,  we  need  schools.  We need  to  see  them  built  soon.  We  need the  school  districts  to  handle  their  fiscal  affairs  safely.  That  is  the  chief problem.  The  way  to  deal  with  it  is  to provide Federal  subsidies  to school districts  who  are  issuing  these  school bonds  by making  those  bonds  tax  credit bonds. There  may,  in  fact,  be  another  problem,  and  that  is  that  my  former  colleagues,  the  tax  bond  counsel,  lead  excessively  boring  lives.  But  it  would  be cheaper to buy a Ferrari for every bond counsel than it would be to urge school districts  across  this  country  to  play the market and keep the supposed profits  as  the  federally  encouraged way  for the  Federal  Government  to  help  them finance school construction. So when we  return  for our  lame-duck session,  if  someone  is  concerned  with the  lack  of  excitement  of  tax  lawyer subspecialists,  let  them  put  forward  a bill  to  provide  a  free  Ferrari  to  every bond  counsel.  But  if  we  are  concerned with  building  schools,  let  us  not change  those  arbitrage  provisions.  Let us  not  pretend  that  we  are  helping schools  by  urging  them  to  gamble school bond proceeds. Instead,  let us  instead adopt the plan that is bipartisan, that has been in this House  for over a year  that was put  forward  by  the  gentleman  from New York (Mr. RANGEL),  and  by  the  gentlewoman from  Connecticut  (Mrs.  To put forward that bill and pass a full $25 billion  of  tax  credit  bonds  to  provide the  maximum  possible  assistance  to local schools. Let  me  now  launch  into  a  second topic,  a  topic  about  which  I  have  addressed this House in the past; and that is  the  mischaracterizations  of  statements  made  by  the  Governor  of  Texas. I  refer  not  to  his  comments  about events  long  ago  in Kennebunkport,  but rather  his  own  description  of  his  tax plan. I  do  not  know  whether  it  is  because the Governor has not read and fully understood  his  tax  plan  or  whether  the Governor  just  cannot  get  away  from constantly  mischaracterizing  it  to  the American  people. But  there  are  several myths  that  are  repeated,  frankly,  almost  every  day  on  the  campaign stump.  I  would  like  to  set  them straight. The  first  is  that  the Bush plan would provide  a  tax  relief  to  every  taxpayer. This  is  simply  false.  See,  Mr.  Speaker, there are 30 million Americans who pay FICA  tax,  have  it  pulled  out  of  their wages  by  the  Federal  Government every  year,  but who  do  not  pay  income tax. These 30 million Federal taxpayers receive not one penny of tax relief from JOHNSON).

Clayton  Warnock  who has  admirably  served  his  community  in Treutlen County, GA,  for more  than half a  century. Judge Warnock was named Treutlen County attorney  in  1947  and  has  also  served  as Solicitor  of  City  Court  and  Judge  of  City  Court  of Soperton,  which  became  the  State  Court  of Treutlen  County  in  1968.  During  his  years  on the  bench,  Warnock  reviewed  over  40,000 cases,  only  two  of  which  were  appealed  and those  decisions  were  upheld  by  the  Appellate Court.  Judge  Warnock  resigned  in  1991  for health  reasons  but  continued  to  play  an  active role  in  the  community  of  Treutlen  County  Hospital  Authority  and  the  Treutlen  County  Development Authority. Judge  Warnock  played  an  instrumental  role in  founding  the  county  development  authority and  creating  economic  opportunities  in Treutlen  County,  which  have  helped  create and  sustain  jobs  that  are  critical  to  livelihoods of  many  men  and  women  in  middle  and  south Georgia. His  perseverance  in  following  the  law,  his dedication  to  justice,  his  earnest  work  for  the people  of  Georgia,  and  his  commitment  to  improving  the  lives  of  the  families  of  Treutlen County  have  characterized  his  service  as  a community  leader.  His  life  has  been  one  of great  public  service,  dedication,  and  commitment.  It  is  my  great  honor  to  represent  Judge Warnock  and  the  people  of  Treutlen  County for  whom  he  has  done  so  much.  I  applaud Judge  Warnock  for  his  leadership  and  distinguished  service,  congratulate  him  on  a  job well  done,  and  wish  him  all  the  best  in  his  future endeavors. f TRIBUTE  TO  ARAM  THE  HONORABLE SEVERIAN HON.  ANNA  G.  ESHOO OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, November 3, 2000 Ms.  ESHOO.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to honor  a  proud  American  and  distinguished Californian,  the  Honorable  Aram  Severian,  on the  occasion  of  his  retirement  from  the  Superior Court of San Mateo County, CA. Aram  Severian  began  his  career  in  private practice,  but  soon  moved  to  public  judicial work.  He  became  deputy  district  attorney  of San  Mateo  County  in  1971  and  commissioner of  the  San  Mateo  County  Superior  Court  in 1976.  In  December  1986,  Governor  George Deukmejian  appointed  Aram  Severian  to  the San  Mateo  County  Municipal  Court.  In  1989, he  became  the  presiding  judge  and  in  December  of  that  year,  Governor  Deukmejian  again recognized  Judge  Aram  Severian  and  appointed  him  to  the  Superior  Court  in  San Mateo  County.  He  has  served  with  distinction as  the  presiding  judge  of  the  Superior  Court since 1994. Judge  Aram  Severian  has  generously  donated his personal  time and energy  to  community  service  throughout  his  life.  He  served  as director  of  the  United  Cerebral  Palsy  Foundation  of  San  Mateo,  coached  Little  League baseball  in  Foster  City  and  he  has  been  the chairman  of  the  Parish  Council  at  his  Armenian  Apostolic  Church.  Time  and  again  Judge Aram  Severian  has  given  of  himself  and  his talents  for  the betterment of our  community. Aram  Severian  has  an  exceptional  partner in  life  in  Hasma  Severian,  who  in  her  own right  is  a  highly  regarded  member  of  our  community,  and  is  respected  for  her  years  of  important  advocacy  and  volunteerism  and  who today,  remains  devoted  to  the  Redwood  City Library.  They  are  the  proud  parents  of  three grown  children, Michael, Linda and Lisa. Judge  Aram  Severian\u2019s  life  of  community leadership  and  public  service  is  instructive  to us  all.  His  dedication  to  the  ideals  of  democracy  and  his  record  of  wise  and  fair  adjudication  stands  tall,  and  it  is  therefore  fitting  that he  is  being  honored  on  the  occasion  of  his  retirement  from  the Superior Court  of San Mateo County. So  today, Mr. Speaker,  I  ask my  colleagues, to  join  me  in  honoring  this  great  and  good man  whom  I\u2019m  proud  to  call my  friend  for  over 30  years.  We  are  indeed  a  better  country  and a better people because of him. f 100TH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  BLOCK COMMUNICATIONS,  INC. HON.  MARCY  KAPTUR OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, November 3, 2000 Ms.  KAPTUR.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to recognize  the  100th  anniversary  of  Block Communications,  Inc.  The  Block  family  and  its extended  mass  communications  family  celebrates  this  significant  milestone  on  November 2, 2000. Born  in  Lithuania,  moving  to  Germany  for  a time  until  his  family  immigrated  to  the  United States, Paul Bloch began working  in  the newspaper  business  at  age  eleven when  the  Elmira Telegram  in  Elmira,  New  York  hired  him. Through  age  twenty,  Paul  Bloch\u2014who  by  now had  Americanized  the  family  name  to  Block\u2014 worked  in  every  department  of  the  Elmira Telegram  learning  the  trade  and  becoming  especially  adept  at  sales.  Then,  in  1895  and with the  encouragement  of  his  employer,  Paul Block made  the move  to  New  York  City  where he  found  employment  selling  advertising  for newspapers  across  the  country  as  a  national representative  for  the  A.  Frank  Richardson Company. In  1900,  Paul  Block  decided  to  venture  out on  his  own,  and  by  1910  Paul  Block  and  Associates  was  among  the  major  national  newspaper  advertising  representative  firms.  Further branching  out,  Paul  Block  organized  a  group of  investors  in  order  to  purchase  the  Newark Star  Eagle  in  1916.  Purchases  of  several other  newspapers  soon  followed,  and  in  ten years  Paul  Block  owned  the  Detroit  Journal, The  Toledo  Blade,  and  the  Pittsburgh  PostGazette.  Paul  Block  struggled  to  keep  his business  alive  through  the  decade  of  the  Depression,  and  the  company  was  again  thriving upon his death  in 1941. The  company  continued  in  the  Block  family and  eventually  became  known  as  Blade  Communications  Inc.  Through  the  latter  half  of  the century  the  company  diversified  to  include cable  and  broadcast  television,  telecommunications,  and  Internet  opportunities.  Blade Communications  Inc.  holds  fourteen  communication  companies  today.  To  mark  the  company\u2019s  centennial,  the  company\u2019s  name  was changed  once  more  to  Block  Communications Inc. The  Block  family  remains  a  strong  fixture  in Toledo,  Ohio  and  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania, where  it  still owns The Blade and  the Post-Gazette.  The  Block  imprimatur  is  evident  in many of  these  cities\u2019  major  projects  and  institutions, and  the  family  remains  an  integral  component of  both  communities.  I  join  with  many  others as  we  salute  one  hundred  years  of  Block  family  tradition  in  communications  and  community, and  look  forward  to  the  next  one  hundred years. HONORING  MUSEUM  LAND f THE  SANDY  SPRING IN  ROCKVILLE,  MARYHON.  CONSTANCE  A.  MORELLA OF MARYLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, November 3, 2000 Mrs. MORELLA. Mr.  Speaker,  today  I  speak of  the  success  of  the  Sandy  Spring  Museum in  Rockville,  Maryland,  on  the  occasion  of  its 20th  anniversary  celebration.  Twenty  years ago  the  museum  started  with  a  few  dozen people  in  the  basement  of  a  Sandy  Spring Bank  branch  office.  Today  it  has  more  than 1,000  members,  a  nine  acre  campus,  and  a million dollar building. The  Sandy  Spring  Museum  is  a  valuable asset  to  our  community  in  that  it  provides  educational  and  informational  services  to  its  citizens,  especially  students.  The  Museum  provides  such  worthwhile  services  as  a  yearly musical  concert  series,  an  art  gallery,  and  a large  public  research  library.  In  addition,  it houses  thousands  of  artifacts  related  to  the Sandy  Spring  community,  which  is  over  250 years old. Most  of  the  success  of  the  Museum  is  due to  the  dedication  and  support  of  the  officers, staff,  and  members,  and  I  commend  them  for their  service.  Through  their  hard work,  the Museum  has  been  successful  in  contributing  to \u2022 (cid:84)(cid:104)(cid:105)(cid:115)(cid:32) (cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:98)(cid:117)(cid:108)(cid:108)(cid:101)(cid:116)(cid:39)(cid:39)(cid:32) (cid:115)(cid:121)(cid:109)(cid:98)(cid:111)(cid:108)(cid:32) (cid:105)(cid:100)(cid:101)(cid:110)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:102)(cid:105)(cid:101)(cid:115)(cid:32) (cid:115)(cid:116)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:109)(cid:101)(cid:110)(cid:116)(cid:115)(cid:32) (cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:32) (cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:115)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:115)(cid:32) (cid:119)(cid:104)(cid:105)(cid:99)(cid:104)(cid:32) (cid:97)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:110)(cid:111)(cid:116)(cid:32) (cid:115)(cid:112)(cid:111)(cid:107)(cid:101)(cid:110)(cid:32) (cid:98)(cid:121)(cid:32) (cid:97)(cid:32)(cid:77)(cid:101)(cid:109)(cid:98)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:32) (cid:111)(cid:102)(cid:32) (cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:83)(cid:101)(cid:110)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:32) (cid:77)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:32) (cid:115)(cid:101)(cid:116)(cid:32) (cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:32) this  typeface  (cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:100)(cid:105)(cid:99)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:115)(cid:32) (cid:119)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:100)(cid:115)(cid:32) (cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:115)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:100)(cid:32) (cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:32) (cid:97)(cid:112)(cid:112)(cid:101)(cid:110)(cid:100)(cid:101)(cid:100)(cid:44)(cid:32) (cid:114)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:32) (cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:97)(cid:110)(cid:32) (cid:115)(cid:112)(cid:111)(cid:107)(cid:101)(cid:110)(cid:44)(cid:32) (cid:98)(cid:121)(cid:32) (cid:97)(cid:32)(cid:77)(cid:101)(cid:109)(cid:98)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:32) (cid:111)(cid:102)(cid:32) (cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:72)(cid:111)(cid:117)(cid:115)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:102)(cid:108)(cid:111)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:46) (cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:32) (cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32) (cid:102)(cid:108)(cid:111)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:46) VerDate 11<MAY>2000 01:18 Nov 04, 2000 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\A03NO8.000 pfrm04 PsN: E03PT1 ",

BARRETT.  BILL f HONORING  CONGRESSWOMAN TILLIE  FOWLER HON.  JUANITA  MILLENDER-McDONALD OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TILLIE FOWLER FOWLER FOWLER FOWLER Friday, November 3, 2000 Ms.  MILLENDER-McDONALD.  Mr.  Speaker, it  gives  me  great  pride  to  congratulate  my  colleague  and  good  friend  Congresswoman on  her  exemplary  service  to  her district  and  the  nation  as  she  retires  from  the U.S. Congress. Congresswoman FOWLER is well  known  as  a determined  advocate  for  a  strong  national  defense  and  has  worked  with  great  success  on behalf  of  the military  personnel  and  facilities  in her  district  and  around  the  country.  Congresswoman  supported  me  immensely  as  I secured  $5 million  in  the  Fiscal  Year  2000 Defense  Appropriations  bill  for  the  Women  in Military  Service  for  America  Memorial  at  Arlington  National  Cemetery.  These  funds  were used  for  much  needed  maintenance  to  the memorial.  Over  the  past  3  years  Congresswoman  has  joined  me  in  organizing  a wreath  laying  ceremony  at  the  Women\u2019s  Memorial  to  pay  homage  to  the  thousands  of women  who  have  served  in  our  armed  services.  Congresswoman  has  served graciously  and  energetically  as  co-host  of  this very  touching  ceremony. The Women\u2019s Memorial  was  dedicated  on  October  18,  1997  and stands  as  the  nation\u2019s  only  major  national  memorial  honoring  women  who  have  served  in our  Nation\u2019s  Armed  Forces  during  all  eras  and in all  services. I  have  been  fortunate  to  serve  with  Congresswoman  on  the  House  Transportation  and  Infrastructure  Committee.  Together, we  have  worked  for  needed  improvements  to road,  mass  transit,  water,  and  public  works  infrastructure.  She  is  one  of  the  hardest  working Members  I  have  had  the  pleasure  of  working with  on  this  committee.  I  applaud  Congresswoman  for  her  dedication  to  serving the  interests  of  her  constituents  and  the  nation.  She  has  been  an  outstanding  colleague and  a  good  friend.  I  feel  privileged  to  have worked with  the Congresswoman and wish her God  speed  as  she  embarks  upon  another  endeavor. FOWLER FOWLER PERSONAL  EXPLANATION HON.  ELIJAH  E.

MOTION  TO  INSTRUCT  CONFEREES ON  H.R.  4577,  DEPARTMENTS  OF LABOR,  HEALTH  AND  HUMAN SERVICES,  AND  EDUCATION,  AND RELATED  AGENCIES  APPROPRIATIONS  ACT  2001 SPEECH OF HON.  JOHN  D.  DINGELL OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BENTSEN,  Tuesday, October 31, 2000 Mr.  DINGELL.  Mr.  Speaker,  recently,  the House  of  Representatives  passed  legislation giving  billions  of  dollars  to  Medicare  providers, the  bulk  of  which  went  to  Medicare  HMOs. This  legislation  did  virtually  nothing  for  providers  under  Medicaid.  Yet,  in  almost  every State  across  the  nation,  Medicaid  payment rates are a  fraction of what Medicare pays. The  motion  offered  by  the  gentleman  from Texas, Mr.  insists  that  the  conferees to  the  Labor  HHS  bill  ensure  provider  payments  in  the  Medicaid  Program  are  adequate to  ensure  that  the  children,  disabled,  and working  families  covered by Medicaid have access  to  quality  health  care.  I  appreciate  his commitment  to  readdress  this  in  the  next  Congress. Medicaid  covers  38  percent  of  all  births  in this  country.  It  pays  for  30  percent  of  all  visits to  pediatricians.  The  Medicaid  Program  insures  more  than  21  million  children  in  this country.  It  also  pays  for  a  significant  portion  of nursing  home  care  for  the  elderly.  Medicaid  is an  insurance  program  that  provides  care  for the  most  vulnerable  in  our  society.  By  failing to  ensure  that Medicaid  provider  payments  are adequate,  access  is  jeopardized  and  we  are failing  our  children,  our  elderly  parents,  and the  disabled  who  depend  on  this  program  for their health  care. In  my  home  State  of  Michigan,  I  have worked  to  ensure  providers  get  adequate  reimbursement  so  that  they  will  continue  to  participate  in  the  Medicaid  Program  and  provide quality  care.  But,  the  situation  remains  dismal. Medicaid  payments  for  obstetric  care  in  Michigan  are  less  than  half  of  the  Medicare  rate. Payment  for  primary  care  services  is  also barely  half  of  what  Medicare  pays.  This,  at  a time  when  the  state  has  more  than  a  billion dollars  in  budget  surplus  and will  receive more than  300  million  dollars  this  fiscal  year  in  tobacco  settlement money. In  Michigan,  what  is  becoming  increasingly troubling  is  that  the  state  is  attempting,  by  expanding  the  use  of  HMOs  in  Medicaid,  to wash  its  hands  completely  of  any  responsibility  to  ensure  providers  are  paid  adequately. The  state  is  shifting  beneficiaries  wholesale into  managed  care,  yet  the  state  is  failing  to monitor  aggressively  the  adequacy  of  HMOs\u2019 payments  to  doctors,  hospitals,  and  nursing homes  that  provide  care  for  beneficiaries.  In Michigan,  inadequate  provider  payments  by managed  care  plans  under  contract  with  the state  have  resulted  in  disruption  in  care  and difficulty  for  many  in  obtaining  care.  Particularly  acute  problems  have  surfaced  for  individuals  with  HIV  and  children  with  special  needs. We  have  a  responsibility  to  ensure  provider payments  are  adequate  for  beneficiaries whether  they  are  in  fee-for-service  or  managed  care. Nursing  homes  imbursement  to  ficiaries.  In  2000,  too,  receive  woefully  low  recare  for  Medicaid  beneit  is  projected  that more  than VerDate 11<MAY>2000 01:18 Nov 04, 2000 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\\CR\\FM\\A03NO8.031 pfrm04 PsN: E03PT1 "

Mr.  Speaker,  I  ask unanimous  consent  that  all  Members may  have  5  legislative  days  within which  to  revise  and  extend  their  remarks on S. 1761. The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Is  there objection  to  the  request  of  the  gentleman from Nevada? There was no objection. Mr.  GIBBONS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  S.  1761  will  enable  the Bureau  of  Reclamation  to  develop  a program  to  improve  the  supply  of water  in  the  Lower  Rio  Grande  region of the State of Texas. This action is needed for two reasons. The  first  concerns  local  weather  patterns.  There  have  been  several  periods in the last 10 years that rainfall in this area  of  Texas  has  been  below  normal. The  second  is  that  Mexico  failed  from the period 1992 through 1997 to deliver 1 million  acre  feet  of  water  to  the  Rio Grande,  which  is  a  principal  source  of water for this area. As of today, that deficit has not been corrected.  In addition to setting up the general  program,  this  legislation  also provides  authorization  for  four  specific projects  involving  the  lining  of  irrigation  canals  and  substituting  pipes  for canals.  Both  will  conserve  significant amounts of water. Mr.  Speaker,  I  urge  bill. Mr.  Speaker,  my time. Mr.  GEORGE  MILLER  of  California. Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  myself  such  time as I may consume. Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  in  support  of  S. 1761,  a  bill  that  provides  for water  conservation  and  water  supply  improvements  in  the  Lower  Rio  Grande  River Basin. Projects  such  as  canal  lining,  improvements to pipelines, installation of water meters  will  be  eligible  for  financial  assistance  under  this  legislation. As  we  have  seen  in  all  the  western States, projects like these can substantially  improve  the  efficiency  of  existing water  supplies and may even eliminate  the  need  for  additional  new  water supply projects. balance  support  reserve  this the  for  of I  ",

Every time  we  move  further  down  the  process,  the  results  are  the  same. Governor Bush  is  still ahead  in  the election. And it  seems  to me, Mr.  Speaker,  that  it  is entirely  appropriate  at  this  time  that the  Vice  President  do  the  right  thing for  the  country,  the  statesman-like thing  for the country, and concede  this election. f SEEKING  PROTECTION  FOR  KASHMIRI  PANDITS  DURING  CEASEFIRE The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.  Under  a previous  order  of  the  House,  the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr.  PALLONE.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  wanted  tonight  to  spend  a  few minutes  saying,  first  of  all,  that  I  am  pleased  that the  Government  of  Pakistan  has  positively  responded  to  India\u2019s  month-long cease-fire in Kashmir. b 1845 I  think  many  of  us  know  that  about a  week  ago,  India  declared  a  cease-fire unilaterally, hoping that it would get a positive response from Pakistan as well as from some of the secessionist or separatist  organizations  that  operate within  Kashmir.  We  have  found  out over the weekend that Pakistan did decide,  as  the  foreign  secretary  said,  to observe  maximum  restraint  with  regard  to  its  troops  that  were  deployed along the disputed border in Kashmir. Last  week,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  wrote  to the  Pakistani  ambassador  in  Washington  asking  his  government  to  accept  India\u2019s  call  for  a  cease-fire,  and  I was  very  pleased  again  to  hear  that Pakistan\u2019s  foreign  secretary  had  indicated  now  that  they  will  also  observe it.  In  addition,  I  thought  it  was  particularly  relevant  that  the  All  Parties Hurriyat Conference had indicated that they  might  be  prepared  to  begin  talks or  negotiations  with  India  with  regard to  Kashmir.  Certainly  having  them come  back  to  the  table  and  have  discussions  with  the  Indian  government with  regard  to  Kashmir  is  a  positive sign.  Between  the  Pakistani  actions and  the  actions  of  the  All  Parties Hurriyat  Conference,  we  might  actually  see  some  positive  developments over the next few weeks or the next few months  with  regard  to  peace  in  Kashmir. However,  in  the  midst  of  all  this,  I found  it  very  unfortunate  that  the Kashmiri  Pandits,  the  Hindus  as  well as  the  Sikhs,  who  are  a  minority  in Kashmir,  continue  to  be  the  victims  of violence.  Over  the  weekend  again,  we heard,  in  fact,  on  Friday  that  four sleeping  Hindu  children  between  the ages of 3 and 15 years old were shot and killed  in  a  remote  Kashmiri  mountain village.  This  is  the  third  attack  on week Kashmiri  Pandits  in  less  than  a  since India declared the cease-fire. Again,  why  is  it  that  the  minorities in Kashmir, the Pandits, the Hindu minority  as  well  as  the  Sikhs  who  have also suffered and some have been killed over  the  last week  since  the  cease-fire, continue  to  be  the  subject  of  these  attacks?  I  can  only  hope  that  with  the joint  cease-fire  that  now  appears  to  be in  existence  and  the  fact  that  there may  be  talks  with  some  of  the  separatist groups, that the violence against minorities  such  as  the  Pandits  and  the Sikhs  will  stop,  because  for  too  long they have been the victims, if you will, more  than  any  other  group,  of  the problems and of the violence and of the continued dispute over Kashmir. Mr.  Speaker,  today  I  wrote  a  letter to  the  Pakistani  ambassador  in  Washington  not  only  thanking  him  for  deciding  to  go  ahead  with  the  cease-fire but  also  asking  that  steps  be  taken  to try  to  end  the  violence  against  the Pandits.  I wrote  a  similar  letter  to  the Indian  ambassador  in  Washington,  not only  commending  him  and  Prime  Minister  Vajpayee  for  sticking  with  this Ramadan  cease-fire  for  the  month  but also  asking  that  steps  be  taken  by  the Indian  government  to  try  to  protect the Kashmiri Pandits as well. I  wanted  to  add,  Mr.  Speaker,  that the  Prime  Minister  of  India,  Mr. Vajpayee,  has  to  be  commended  not only  for  unilaterally  declaring  the cease-fire  last  week  but  also  for  doing so  despite  the  fact  that  the  separatist militants  continued  with  their  violent acts over this last week and despite the fact  that  many  domestic  opponents criticized  his  action.  Prime  Minister Vajpayee  has  told me many  times  that he  cares  for  the  plight  of  the  Kashmiri Pandits  and  understands  that  there will  never  be  peace  in  Kashmir  unless they  can  live  in  their  homes  without fear.  I  also  ask  once  again  that  when any  peace  talks  take  place  over  the next  few  weeks,  that  the  status  of  the Pandits  and  their  security  also  be raised  in  the  context  of  those  peace talks.  If  we  are  ever  going  to  see  toleration of all religions in Kashmir, it is certainly necessary that steps be taken now  to  protect  them,  to  protect  their security, and that reference be made to their status in the context of any peace talks that might take place. f DREIER)  INAUGURATION  OF  MEXICAN PRESIDENT  VICENTE  FOX The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. SIMPSON). Under a previous order of the House,  the  gentleman  from  California (Mr.  is  recognized  for  5  minutes. Mr.  DREIER.  Mr.  Speaker,  at  a  time when  the  world\u2019s  attention  is  focused on  the presidential election here  in  the United  States,  I  would  like  to  take  a few  minutes  to  talk  about  a  very  historic occurrence  that  took place at  the end of last week. I had the honor, along with  several  of  our  colleagues,  a  delegation  led  by  the  gentleman  from  New GILMAN),  York  (Mr.  the  Secretary  of State  here,  and  several  others,  including  the  Governor  of  California,  Gray Davis,  to  represent  the  United  States at  the  inauguration  of  Vicente  Fox  in Mexico. This inaugural took place last Friday morning.  It  was  very  thrilling  because it  was  clearly  one  of  the  most  historic developments in modern history for the western  hemisphere.  After  over  7  decades of one-party  control where  the  Institutional Revolutionary Party, established  in  1928,  had  controlled  Mexico, we  saw  an  election  take  place  on  July 2  at  which  the  opposition  party,  the National  Action  Party,  and  its  nominee, Vicente Fox, was successful. When we look at what it is that actually  brought  these  free  and  fair  elections  about,  it  is  very  important  to  realize  that  it  has  been  the  expansion  of our  Western  values  that  has  been  responsible  for  it  and  was  really  a  coalition  that  consisted,  I  believe,  of  primarily  the  statement  that  was  first made  by  Ronald  Reagan  in  November of  1979  when  he  announced  his  candidacy  for  President  in  which  he  said he  envisioned  an  accord  of  the  Americas where we would  have  the  free  flow of goods and services. As  we  all  know,  that  ended  up  with legislation  that  passed  in  1993  known as  the  North  American  Free  Trade Agreement.  While  I  know  that  NAFTA is  often  maligned,  we  have  to  realize that there has been tremendous success in Canada, the United States, and Mexico.  We  have  seen  a  dramatic  increase in  the  standard  of  living  in  all  three countries,  in  large  part  due  to  the  expanded trade that we have enjoyed. Now, what happened was that 6 years ago,  following  the  beginning  of  major economic  reforms  in  Mexico,  we  saw the  call  by  President  Ernesto  Zedillo for  free  and  fair  elections.  He  established  an  organization  known  as  the IFE,  the  Federal  Electoral  Institute  in Mexico,  that  would  in  fact  be  independent of  the government and oversee the electoral process. It worked out extremely  well,  and  we  finally  saw  the completion  of  that  tie  between  economic  and  political  freedom  last  Friday. We were  very  privileged,  as  I  said,  to be  able  to  represent  the  United  States. Our governor, Gray Davis, was the first governor  of  California  since  Earl  Warren  to  attend  an  inauguration  of  a Mexican president. I believe the significance  of  that  and  the  representation that  we  had  from  the  United  States  is very, very important. President  Fox  has  a  very  interesting challenge  ahead  of  him,  but  he  had some  moving  remarks  in  his  inaugural address.  He  talked  about  the  challenge of  improving  the  economy  and  making sure  that  no  one  in  Mexico  is  left  behind. He said, \u2018\u2018We can\u2019t have islands of prosperity amidst seas of poverty.\u2019\u2019 His commitment  to  ensuring  that  the  children  of  Mexico  are  addressed,  their needs  are  addressed  and  taken  care  of, his  commitment  to  making  sure  that ",

WAXMAN OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, December 4, 2000 Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, To  be  able  to  practice  five  things  everywhere  under  heaven  constitutes  perfect  virtue. . . . [They  are]  gravity,  generosity  of soul,  sincerity,  earnestness,  and  kindness.\u2014 Confucius We  are  diminished  by  the  death  of  our former  colleague,  Sid  Yates,  who  was  by every  estimation  a  model  legislator  and  one  of the  most  decent  men  to  have  served  in  the House of Representatives. Sid  devoted  his  life  to  public  service  and spent  nearly  a  half  century  in  Congress  working  to  better  the  lives  of  all  Americans.  As Chairman  of  the  Interior  Appropriations  Subcommittee,  he  worked  hard  for  the  protection of  our  environment  and  the  enrichment  of  our culture.  He  was  committed  to  bringing  cultural opportunities  to  Americans  of  all  backgrounds in  every  part  of  the  country  and  he  made  sure that  the  federal  government  played  a  strong role  in  nurturing  the  development  of  talented artists. Sid  always  treated  his  congressional  colleagues  with  respect  and  courtesy.  In  recent years,  when  federal  funding  for  the  arts  became  a  polarizing  issue,  Sid  responded  to  intolerance with  tolerance  and  kindness. He was always  an  honest  broker. He  never  questioned or  impugned  his  opponents\u2019  motives.  He  was unwavering  in  his  beliefs.  And,  he  never  abandoned principle  for  temporary political gain. Sid  left  us  a  strong  legacy  of  achievement on  which  to  build  and  an  example  of  true statesmanship. f TRIBUTE  TO  MINISTER  BROWN CLEMSON HON.  EDOLPHUS  TOWNS OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, December 4, 2000 Mr.  TOWNS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  wish  today  to pay  tribute  to  one  of  the  outstanding videographers  of  the  African  experience  in New  York  City,  Minister  Clemson  Brown.  During  the  past  25  years,  Minister  Brown  and  his ubiquitous  video  camera  have  captured  over 20,000  hours  of  contemporary  history  in  New York  City.  He  has  recorded  and  documented the  issues  that  have  shaped  and  defined  the experiences  of  African  people  from  Howard Beach  to  Central  Park,  from  Clifford  Glover  to Amadou Diallo. Minister  Brown  is  currently  involved  in  a project  to  create  a  new  museum\u2014the  Living Museum  of  African  People.  It  is  to  be  a  multimedia  spectacular,  consisting  of  exhibits,  artifacts,  and  film  representing  a  chronological timeline  that  extends  from  the  dawn  of  human civilization  in  Africa  and  culminates  in  the present  millennium.  It  is  hoped  that  this  museum  will  eradicate  the  racist  stereotype  that Africans  are  a  people  without  a  civilization, and  create  in  young  people  a  new  sense  of pride and  self-worth. For  the  past  25  years,  he  has  recorded  and documented  the  personalities  and  landmark events  that  have  shaped  and  defined  the  destiny  of  African  people.  He  is  the  president  of Trans  Atlantic  Production,  which  has  archived the world\u2019s  largest  collection  of  African  and  African-American history on  videotape. More  that 20,000  hours  are  raw  and  edited  footage  of film  and  videotape  are  included  in  this  historical  treasury. Minister  Brown  is  a  world  traveler,  as  well as  a  respected  videographer.  His  work  and abiding  interest  in  the  unsung  people  of  the world  have  taken  him  all  over  the  United States,  as  well  as  the  Caribbean,  Panama, Cuba,  El  Salvador,  Nicaragua,  England,  Mexico,  Ethiopia,  and  Kenya.  He  has  traveled along  with  Reverend  and  Mrs.  Jesse  Jackson, the  Reverend  Herbert  Daughtry,  Dr.  Yosef Ben  Jochannan,  and  Dr.  Ivan  Van  Sertima. Minister  Brown  served  as  head  of  the  American  delegation  that  journeyed  to  Kenya  to  investigate  the  promising  AIDS  therapy, KEMRON. His  interest  in  young  people  led  to  the  production of over 75 major documentaries, which have  been  used  as  learning  materials  in scores  of  community  programs,  schools,  and colleges across  the  country. Minister  Brown  has  also  trained  uncounted numbers  of  young  people  in  the  use  of  media equipment  and  video  technology. He  has  done this  through  apprenticeship  programs  and  the establishment  of  media  training  courses  in schools  in  the New York City area. He  is married  to Lady V. Brown and has  two children\u2014Clemson  R.  Brown  and  Herlinda Brown. IN  RECOGNITION  OF  STATE  REPRESENTATIVE  GENE  KREBS  FOR HIS  SERVICE  TO  OHIO HON.  PAUL  E.  GILLMOR OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, December 4, 2000 Mr.  GILLMOR.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  wish  today  to recognize  an  extraordinary  member  of  the Ohio  House  of  Representatives  and  his  outstanding  service  to  the  state  of  Ohio.  Representative  Gene  Krebs  currently  represents Ohio\u2019s  60th  House  district,  which  includes  part of Butler County and all of Preble County. In  his  four  terms  in  the  Ohio  House,  Representative  Krebs  focused  on  many  issues  of importance  to  Ohioans.  Most  notably,  he  has directed much of his energy  towards  improving our  schools.  He  sought  many  legislative  reforms  dealing  with  issues  from  school  safety to  funding.  He  fought  to  improve  school  safety by  giving  principals  and  school  officials  the power  to properly deal with  students who bring weapons  to  school.  Additionally,  he  supported directing  tobacco  settlement  funds  to  schools. He  has  also  worked  to  ensure  that  schools  in low-wealth  districts  have  the  needed  funds  to successfully  compete  with  schools  across Ohio. Another  of  Representative  Krebs\u2019  efforts  in the  Ohio  House  of  Representatives  focused on  protecting  Ohio  farmers  and  preserving farmland.  He  sought  to  ensure  that  droughtridden  farmers  receive  a  temporary  tax  break to  avoid  loan  defaults,  thereby  preventing farmers  from  sinking  lower  into  debt.  By  creating  a  farmland  preservation  task  force,  he worked  to  guarantee  a  strong  future  for  Ohio\u2019s vital  farming  communities. Fortunately,  the  state  of  Ohio  will  not  lose this  valuable  asset.  Representative  Krebs  has been  elected  to  serve  as  a  Preble  County Commissioner.  Preble  County  will  continue  to benefit  from  his  knowledge  and  considerable experience. I  would  also  like  to  recognize  his  wife,  Jan, and  their  two daughters, Kindra and Alaina,  for supporting  Representative  Krebs\u2019  efforts  in  the Ohio House of Representatives. Mr.  Speaker,  Representative  Gene  Krebs  is an  asset  to  the  state  of  Ohio  and  to  his  constituents.  I  ask  my  colleagues  in  the  106th Congress  to  join  me  in  commending  him  for his  eight  years  of  service  and  to  wish  him  the best  in all of his  future endeavors. f CONGRATULATING  JENNIFER BARRETT HON.

A. E.  SERRANO \u00b4 JOSE HON.  OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES pay Jr., his Nooffithe his who Monday, December 4, 2000 Mr.  SERRANO.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  to  tribute  to  the  late  Edward  A.  Stevenson,  an  outstanding  individual  who  dedicated  life  to  public  service.  He  was  honored  on  vember  19  by  family,  friends,  and  public  cials  for  his  outstanding  contributions  to  community  with  a  street  renaming  in  honor.  This  is  a  fitting  tribute  for  a  man  has given  so much  to our  community. The  Honorable  Edward  A.  Stevenson,  Jr. was  the  only  child  of  the  distinguished  former Assemblyman  Edward  A.  Stevenson,  Sr.,  who was  the  first  Caribbean-American  to  serve  in the  New  York  State  Assembly,  representing the  78th  Assembly  District  in  the  Morrisania section  of  the  Bronx.  He  was  also  a  founder of  the  Jackson  Democratic  Club  in  the  South Bronx. Mr.  Speaker,  like  his  father,  Edward  Stevenson,  Jr.  was  an  active  public  servant  in  the Democratic  party  both  in  the  Bronx  and  citywide.  He  became  a  District  Leader  in  the  78th A.D.  and  managed  several  political  campaigns. Under  his  leadership  in  the  early  1970\u2019s,  the Bronx  Shepard\u2019s  Restoration  Corporation, composed  of  more  than  100  religious  organizations  committed  to  rebuilding  the Bronx, was founded. He understood  the need  for  the  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  new  housing projects  for  the  homeless,  the  elderly,  and low-  and  moderate-income  families,  as  well  as in  facilitating  educational  opportunities  for  our youth.  He  also  served  as  Chairman  of  the Neighborhood  Advisory  Board  and  as  a  member  of  Community  Board  9.  In  1990,  he  founded Envirogard Corporation, a  real estate enterprise  to  pursue  residential  property  management.  Stevenson  Jr.  also  managed  the  972unit  Lafayette-Boynton  housing  complex  in  the Soundview  community. Mr.  Speaker,  as  cofounder  of  Voters  Organized  To Educate  and Register  (V.O.T.E.R.),  a not-for-profit  entity,  he  helped  and  encouraged thousands  of  Bronx  residents  to  participate  in the  electoral  process.  Two  days  before  his  untimely  death  in  December  1996,  Edward  Stevenson,  Jr.  was  appointed  Commissioner  of the  New  York  City  Board  of  Elections  for  the Bronx. Edward  A.  Stevenson,  Jr.  is  survived  by  his wife  Mildred  and  his  eight  sons,  Greg,  Eric, Eddie  Jr.,  John, Cecil, Scott, Mark, and Motier. Like  his  father  and  grandfather,  Eric  is  proudly continuing  the  family  tradition of public  service. The 34-year-old  currently works as Community Coordinator  under  Bronx  Borough  President Fernando Ferrer. Mr.  Speaker,  I  in  paying  tribute  Stevenson,  Jr. ask my  colleagues  to  join me to  the  Honorable  Edward  A. f TRIBUTE  TO  TWENTIETH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  REE\u2019S  CONTRACT SERVICE,  INC. HON.  DENNIS  MOORE OF KANSAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, December 4, 2000 Mr.  MOORE.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  wish  today  to pay  tribute  to  B. Marie  Foster,  the  founder  and president  of  Ree\u2019s  Contract  Service,  Inc.,  as that  Overland  Park,  Kansas,  based  firm  celebrates  its  twentieth anniversary  in business. For  several  years  prior  to  the  founding  of Ree\u2019s  Contract  Service,  Ms.  Foster  was  employed  by  government  contractors,  including Quality  Maintenance  of  Kansas  City  and  for Tombs  and  Sons,  which  assisted  in  the  construction  of  the  Alaska  petroleum  pipeline. Based  upon  the  knowledge  and  experience she  gained  from  those  positions,  Ms.  Foster decided  in  September  1980  that  she  could provide  quality  services  to  the  federal  government  through  her  own  contracting  firm.  Working  from  her  home,  she  won  her  first  contract in  November  1980  to  provide  armed  guard services  at  the  U.S.  Weapons  Testing  Area  in Jericho,  Vermont,  providing  twenty-four  hour service  with  four  employees.  In  March  1981, Ms.  Foster  won  her  second  service  contract  in Champaign,  Illinois. During  1981,  Ree\u2019s  Contract  Services  was awarded  its  first  major  contract  at  the  Federal Law  Enforcement  Training  Center  in  Glynco, Georgia.  The  firm  contracted  to  provide  services  that  included  armed  security  guards,  bus transportation,  training  support,  janitorial  services,  and  dormitory  management.  The  firm held  the  armed  guard  service  contract  for three  consecutive  terms  totaling  fifteen  years; the  other  service  contracts  were  held  for  two consecutive  terms.  Two  of  the  contracts  were cost  reimbursable  with  incentive  fees,  during the  terms  of  the  contracts  from  1981\u20131995, the  firm  never  received  a  rating  of  less  than superior. Ree\u2019s  Contract  Services,  Inc.,  was  incorporated  on  March  1,  1992.  As  founder,  owner, president  and  operator  of  the  firm  since  its  inception,  Ms.  Foster  has  always  believed  that the  actions  of  her  employees  are  a  personal reflection  of  herself,  and  that  for  her  business to  be  successful,  her  employees  must  provide the  highest  quality  service.  Since  her  employees  are  her  most  valuable  assets,  Ms.  Foster wants  each  one  to  know  they  are  important and  cared  for by her. Ree\u2019s  Contract  Services  has  developed  into a  successful  contracting  firm,  ultimately  growing  to  approximately  400  employees.  The  firm has  held  contracts  providing  services  in  17  different  states.  Most  recently,  the  firm  was awarded  the  Heartland  Regional  Contract  for guard  services  at  all  federal  facilities  under  the management of  the General Services Administration  within  Missouri,  Kansas,  Iowa  and  Nebraska. As  the  result  of  Ree\u2019s  Contract  Service\u2019s employees\u2019  professionalism  and  provision  of quality  services,  the  firm  has  developed  a  reputation  for  excellence  in  government  contracting.  B.  Marie  Foster  and  the  firm\u2019s  employees  should  be  extremely  proud  of  this  reputation  and  I  know  they  will  continue  to  expend  every  possible  effort  to  maintain  and  improve  that  reputation.  In  1996,  the  firm  was nominated  for  the  Small  Business  Administration\u2019s  Prime  Contractor  of  the  Year  Award; subsequently,  for  1996  and  1997,  the  firm  received  the  SBA  Director\u2019s  Award  of  Excellence. Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  very  pleased  to  have  this opportunity  to  pay  tribute  to  B.  Marie  Foster and  Ree\u2019s  Contract  Service.  I  am  proud  to represent  them  in  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives  and  I  wish  Ms.  Foster  and  her staff  continued  success  in  the  years ahead. f HONORING  ALLEN  C.  BARTEL HON.  JOHN  SHIMKUS OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, December 4, 2000 Mr.  SHIMKUS.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to honor  Mr.  Allen  C.  Bartel  who  served  as  the Scoutmaster  for  Boy  Scout  Troop  31  in Edwardsville,  IL.  His  service  to  scouting spanned  over  15  years  of  his  adult  life.  Mr. Bartel  is  retiring at  the end of  the  year. During  that  time,  he  guided  17  young  men to  the  rank  of  Eagle  and  countless  others through  the  wonderful  experience  of  scouting. The  role  of  the  scoutmaster  is  more  than teaching  young  men  to  tie  knots  and  start campfires.  They  provide  an  educational  program  for  boys  and  young  men  to  build  character,  to  participate  in  citizenship,  and  to  develop personal  fitness. Those  character  issues  emanate  from  the Scout  Laws\u2014A  scout  is:  Trustworthy,  Loyal, Helpful,  Friendly,  Courteous,  Kind,  Obedient, Cheerful,  Thrifty,  Brave,  Clean  and  Reverent. Scouting  is  an  excellent  way  to  instill  leadership  qualities  in  our  young  men.  Without  the time  and  commitment  of  people  like  Allen Bartel,  some  boys  may  not  be  exposed  to these  important  life  lessons. That  is  why  I  am  honored  to  recognize  hard  work  and  volunteer  efforts  of  men  Allen. Thank  you  for making a difference. the like f HONORING  DAVID  BROWER HON.  NANCY  PELOSI OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, December 4, 2000 Ms.  PELOSI.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  to  pay  my final  respects  to  David  Brower,  one  of  the  true heroes  of  the  environmental  movement.  David Brower  was  utterly  devoted  to  the  health  of our  planet. He  affected America\u2019s  physical  and cultural  landscape  with  his  staunch  defense  of the  Earth.  He  changed  the  way  Americans view  the  environment  and  changed  the  environment  in  which  they  lived.  David  Brower was one of  the Earth\u2019s greatest  friends. When  David  Brower  joined  the  Sierra  Club in  1933,  the  group  was  mainly  an  association of  hikers  interested  more  in  enjoying  nature than ",
