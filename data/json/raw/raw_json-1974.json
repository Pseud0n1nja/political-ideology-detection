SENATE, Washington, D.C., December 31, 1973. Hon. GERALD R. FORD, President of the Senate, U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR MR.

JOHN J. GU..LIGAN, Governor. TED W. BROWN, Secretary of State. The VICE PRESIDENT. The creden(cid:173)tials will be recorded and placed on file. If there is no objection, the Senator(cid:173)designate will present himself at the desk and the Chair will administer the oath of office. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I desire to be heard at this point in the proceedings. The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nebraska. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, follow(cid:173)ing the anouncement that the Governor of Ohio had designated Mr. METZEN(cid:173)BAUM to become one of the U.S. Senators from Ohio, certain matters were called to our attention. One of them appeared in the newspapers. It raises some ques(cid:173)tions that I believe should be determined at this point. I am not in a position to nor do I pronounce guilt upon any man prior to a hearing. I can best give to the Senate an ac(cid:173)count of this situation by reading a let(cid:173)ter that I wrote to the Honorable MIKE MANSFIELD, majority leader, U.S. Senate, on January 14, 1974. The letter is as follows: DEAR SENATOR MANSFIELD: This letter re(cid:173)lates to the seating of Howard Metzenbaum as a Senator from the State of Ohio. On December 27, the Washington 1973, Star-News carried an Associated Press article stating: \"Cleveland industrialist Howard Metzen(cid:173)baum paid $118,102 in taxes the government claims he owed, Dec. 17, two days before he was appointed U.S. Senator from Ohio, U.S. Tax Court records here showed.\" I have examined the documents on file in the U.S. Tax Court in reference to this mat(cid:173)ter. The government alleges that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) found the following: \"It is determined that the trans(cid:173)actions \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Mr. President, the gravamen of my complaint is not that somebody owed taxes, that this gentleman owed taxes, that he paid them, or that he exercised his right to litigate. That is all conceded. The point involved is the determination by the Internal Revenue Service that transactions set up in his tax return were not bona fide. Were they? The only way we can find out through an investigation and hearing. Reading on from the letter: is I do not know Mr. Metzenbaum. Certainly, there is nothing personal in my presentation, neither are there any partisan considerations because everyone understands that the ap(cid:173)pointment will go to a member of the ma(cid:173)jority party. I make the presentation because the integrity of the Senate is at stake. Section V, Article I, of the Constitution provides that each house shall be the judge of the qualifi(cid:173)cations of its own members. During the time of your leadership, rele(cid:173)vant precedents applicable to this situation have been clearly established. I refer specifi(cid:173)cally to three precedents. The Senator from Connecticut was censured. The so-called Wa(cid:173)tergate Com.mlttee has applied far reachlng standards of conduct for the Chief Executive. The third precedent to which :r refer were the hearings on the confirmation of our pres(cid:173)ent Vice President. The Vice President was subjected to one of the most intense investigations ever con(cid:173)ducted. Judicial notice was not taken of the fact that the voters of his Congressional Dis(cid:173)trict had for a quarter of a century approved his conduct. The Vice President was required to prove his innocence in the most minute detail including his finances and tax matters. In determining the qualifications of the Vice President, the Senate went far beyond there(cid:173)quirements enumerated in the Constitution for someone to be eligible for the Office of the President. A similar procedure should be fol(cid:173)lowed when the Senate is asked to pass on the qualifications of someone seeking to be seated as a member of the Senate. To do otherwise would reflect upon the U.S. Senate. Mr. Howard Metzenbaum should not be seated as a member of the Senate when the Senate reconvenes on January 21, 1974. He should be asked to stand aside until an ap(cid:173)propriate com.mlttee makes a thorough and complete investigation of his income tax situation. If it had developed that our Vice President, two days before his appointment, had set(cid:173)tled a tax claim of $118,102, relating to a transaction which the IRS determined was \"not bona fide\", believe it is safe to say that the Senate would not have confirmed him. The purpose of this letter is to specifically request that you, as the Majority Leader, as(cid:173)sume the responsibility of seeing to it that Mr. Metzenbaum is not seated a-s a member of the U.S. Senate and that an appropriate investigation be conducted. Respectfully yours, CARL T. CURTIS, U.S. Senator. I Mr. President, I repeat: The issue here is not whether someone should ever be seated in this body owing taxes or having recently paid taxes or having asserted his right to contest a tax claim. The issue here is a determination by the Internal Revenue Service that the individual had entered into transactions that were not bona fide. And it goes on to name them-Wer-e not bona fide. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Accordingly, the claimed rental losses are determined to be unallowable \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 .\" Webster's New International Dictionary, Second Edition, defines bona fide as \"in or with good faith; without fraud or deceit; genuine; as a bona. fide transaction.\" The determination of the IRS was that the trans(cid:173)actions in question were \"not bona fide.\" Were they? I do not know. I cannot pass on that. All I can say is that the facts warrant an investigation. First, Mr. President, let me state that my letter was addressed to Mr. MANs(cid:173)FIELD, majority leader. I think I am quot(cid:173)ing him accurately when I state that I have received information from him this morning that he expects to take no ac(cid:173)tion. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. CURTIS. I yield. Mr. MANSFIELD. The Senator is ab(cid:173)solutely correct, because it is not the re(cid:173)sponsibility of the majority leader or mi(cid:173)nority leader; it is the responsibility of any Senator who desires to take such action. Mr. CURTIS. Very well. I am happy to have the record clarified so we know ex(cid:173)actly what the position of our very be(cid:173)loved leader is. Therefore, Mr. President, I make the following unanimous-consent request: I ask unanimous consent that the oath ",
            "54": "54 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u00b7-SENATE January 21, 197 ;;,. GUIDE NOTATIONS Because Christmas and other special holi(cid:173)days create greater demand for toys during certain seasons, some toys listed in the Guide may not be available all the time. But toys that are available throughout the year are marked with an asterisk(*). A PG (parental guidance) notation in the Guide indicates adult supervision is advised. Although Giant strives to insure that all toys marked with an asterisk are available at all times, situations such as unforeseen deliv(cid:173)ery problems or unexpected heavy sale of merchandise may make some toys temporarily unavailable. [From the Chicago Today, Dec. 4, 1973] CRACKING DOWN ON UNSAFE TOYS (By Sue Roll) Determined young women, armed with clip(cid:173)boa.rds and endless persistence, are scruti(cid:173)nizing toy counters. But they're not taking inventory. These women, along with students and senior citizen volunteers, are consumer depu(cid:173)ties checking stores for any of the 1,500 toys banned from sale by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. \"It's a tedious job, but it gets easier as you go along,\" said Carol Einhorn, consumer deputy from the National Council of Jewish Women covering Arlington Heights. \"You get to know the banned products list by heart. We've had great cooperation from the stores, and, happily, so far we've only found a couple . of questionable toys.\" Under 1970's Child Protection and Toy Safety Act, the commission can ban the sale of unsafe soys. Toy safety in Chicago is doubly enforced with last year's passage of a city toy safety act. In Chicago, volunteer consumer deputies and investigators from the city's Office of Consumer Sales, Weights and Measures, the Product Safety Commission, Illinois Depart(cid:173)ment of Public Health, and various other groups are checking stores for unsafe toys. But the monitoring is a formidable task. More than 1,200 United States toy manufac(cid:173)turers produce 150,000 different toys and in(cid:173)troduce 5,000 new ones each year. Thousands more are imported. Last year, surveys of stores in Chicago, Minneapolis, Seattle, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Philadelphia by the Food and Drug Ad(cid:173)\u00b7ministration indicated that about 55 per cent of the stores carried unsafe toys. But Al Limberg, assistant director for the Chicago commission office, said: \"We're not finding as many unsafe toys as we found the last two years. Retailers, manu(cid:173)facturers, and wholesalers are aware of the problem and as businessmen, they are reason(cid:173)able people. It is in their vested interest to comply with the law-they know they can be prosecuted if they don't.\" He said improvement was expected this year because toy safety laws have been in effect for two seasons, more manufacture-rs and retailers are taking their own safety steps, and shelves are being checked before the Christmas rush. \"There has been a big improvement over the last two years,\" said Terry Hocin, chief consumer service supervisor for Chicago. \"The federal program really became effective last year. And with the added local emphasis of the city's ordinance, I think there is more awareness of toy safety here than in most other cities.\" Only 2 of 12 stores checked so far this year by commission deputies were selling banned toys. In 550 investigations conducted last year by the city, 20,000 toys were ordered off the shelves. Enforcement of the city ordinance has been handled on a complaint basis this year, pend(cid:173)ing settlement of a suit filed against the city by the Toy Manufacturers Association con(cid:173)cerning the city toy ordinance, Hocin said. He said since the city has agreed to clarify its ordinance, to bring it more in line with federal guidelines, that the suit should be dropped next month. However, the depart(cid:173)ment investigators began full-scale examina(cid:173)tions last weeek, he said. Hocin said distinguishing the packag-ing of banned toys from their modified versions is a problem: The labeling can be the same altho the toy now complies with the law, or the labeling may change while the hazard remains. Another problem comes from the flow of new toys each year. Toys judged safe by the commission have passed a rigorous set of tests, but the commission has no authority for pretesting new toys before they are placed on the market. However, the commission does screen new toys at the annual toy fairs, Limberg said. In support of the toy safety provisions, the toy manufacturers, with the guidance of the Bureau of Standards, drew up a set of volun(cid:173)tary safety standards for the association. Some manufacturers test their own toys, and others send them to the commission and city consumer office for screening and approval. Both city and commission officials say the response of most toy manufacturers and re(cid:173)tailers has been good. \"We are making a maximum effort to comply,\" said a spokesman for one of the largest Chicago-area toy dealers. \"But each time a new [banned products) List comes out, here we go again. We have to move at the expense of almost everything else to make sure we don't stock those toys. We want our customers to feel our store is safe and clean.\" The commission says banned toys will more likely be found in small toy outlets where buyers may be less familiar with the list and where unsold toys are usually kept for two or three years. If the deputies find banned toys, they ask the retailer to remove them from the shelves. Most retailers cooperate, Limberg said. Dep(cid:173)uties also are instructed to report any ques(cid:173)tionable toys that are not on the banned list. The commission will do preliminary tests and, if necessary, send the toys to its na(cid:173)tional laboratories for complete evaluation. \"It's the manufacturer's responsibility to comply before putting the product on the market,\" Limberg said. \"He knows what tests the toy must pass to be judged safe.\" But while authorities are working to make this year's Christmas toys safe ones, the process is not infallible. \"If a toy passes the tests, it is relatively safe, but safety is not an absolute,\" Limberg said. \"What is safe for a 12-year-old 1s not necessarily safe for a 5-year-old.\" [From the Washington Post, Nov. 18, 1973] ToY-SAFETY HAzARDs: REAL oR ExAGGERATED? (By Nancy L. Ross\u00b7) Thirteen-month-old Nanette picked up a peg from the board and put it in her mouth. It lodged in her left bronchial tube, causing an infection, according to the doctor who pronounced her dead two days later. Sam, 3, trying his new tricycle, turned sharply to the left, fell over and suffered a fractured right elbow. An investigator found that the tricycle tipped over easily. As Paul, 11, tried to start his model air(cid:173)plane, the fuel line touched the hot cylinder housing and burst into flames. Paul was treated for second-degree leg burns. The names are fictitious but the accidents are real, taken :from the files of the Nat1onal Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) . Based on computer projections from injury records filed by 119 hospitals across the country in the last fiscal year, emergency room treatment was required in 143,000 toy-related accidents and 372,000 bicycle-related injuries. Emergency room treatment accounts for only part of medical assistance-other cases. are treated in physicians' offices or homes. According to the government's NEISS pro(cid:173)gram, roller skates were shown to be the\u00b7 single most dangerous toy, accounting for 36. per cent of the injuries reported. Tricycles. . were second, followed by toy cars,. trucks,. airplanes and boats. Gasoline-powered toys caused the severest injuries. More boys than girls were hurt last year,. with cuts to the head and neck as a result of falls being the most common injury. Edward M. Swartz, a Boston trial attorney(cid:173)and author of \"Toys That Don't Care,\" says. that from his 15-year experience with product injury cases there are \"as many, if\" not more\" toy-related accidents now. He\u00b7 recently obtained a $1.4-million settlement against a toy manufacturer on behalf of two children seriously burned when their poly-. ester comforter caught fire. Swartz says the same type of fiber \"burns like napalm,\" and\u2022 1s still being used in play sleeping bags. Still pending is a $5 million suit against(cid:173)a major toy manufacturer in western New York State. The cap of one of its wooden figures lodged in the windpipe of a small child who suffered permanent brain damage\u00b7 from lack of oxygen. The toy met existing safety requirements. The company's presi(cid:173)dent, Henry Coords of Fisher-Price, at the' time of the accident headed the safety com(cid:173)mittee of the Toy Manufacturers of America, a trade association representing producers of\" 85 per cent of the dollar volume of toys sold in the United States. He declined to discuss(cid:173)the case . Now president of TMA, Coords believes the(cid:173)unsafe toy issue has been \"much exag(cid:173)gerated and blown out of proportion.\" TMA's. general counsel, Aaron Locker, points out that half of the actual injuries reported by NEISS involved balls or ride-on toys~bi\u00adcycles, roller skates, etc.-which present an inherent danger in the course of normar play. He also notes the few examples of in(cid:173)juries caused by electrical toys, previously thought to be very dangerous. The most dan(cid:173)gerous toy-roller skates--placed 42d on the(cid:173)list of 369 hazardous household products~ and the median toy ranked 230th. The commission figures it a different way however. If the 39 categories of toys are taken as one, toys rank sixth on the list of most hazardous household objects. Bicycles, incidentally, rank number one. All these figures notwithstanding, it can(cid:173)not yet be stated with certitude whether there are really as many-or more-injuries as originally predicted, or whether the num(cid:173)ber has decreased with the increased em(cid:173)phasis put on safety in the past two or three years. So a multi-pronged toy safety campaign-incorporating consumer educa(cid:173)tion, industrial redesign and governmental enforcement--continues. Not all toy-related injuries can be. blamed on unsafe toys. In many cases they result from carelessness on the part of the child or on the part of the parent in selecting the wrong toy for the child's age or not exercis(cid:173)ing adequate supervision. TMA estimates only 15 per cent of toy-related accidents are caused by faulty toys. To increase public awareness, an independ(cid:173)ent governmental agency, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), which has charge of toys, has produced radio and television publlc service announcements in English and Spanish, a color film entitled \"Can You Pass the Toy Safety Test?\", leaf(cid:173)lets, an information hot line and a complete list of 1,500 banned toys. Swartz believes the emphasis on the banned toys is giving the public a false sense of security by implying that the government has removed all the dangerous toys and that anything left on the shelf must be safe. This is untrue for several reasons. First, each year there are about 150,000 toys !or sale, 5.000 of them new models. I I ~I \u2022 ..1, ",

But when it comes to fuel and electricity you don't have too many options, you either use it, starve, freeze, or both. I would like to make a strong suggestion that the govern(cid:173)ment take a long hard look at Big Business for a change and stop trying to squeeze out the little guy like it has in the past. Maybe it would be a good thing for this country to do as Japan does and throw out all its patent rights and the fittest survive in the indus(cid:173)trial world. Maybe that way you could buy a decent product that would outlast the payments before it is worn out. Lastly, I have a small child 5 years old, last winter he spent 10 days in the hospital due to ear infection and a cold developing into pneumonia. The hospital tried for days to find an antibiotic, that he wasn't allergic to. With the result that only 2 of the many available did any good or he wasn't allergic to. Now because some pompous ass and his money hungry stockholders who don't have enough in their Swiss bank ac(cid:173)counts, decide to gouge the public some more I can look forward to another winter of ear problems. Well be it known and forewarned that if anything happens to him, somebody 1s going to pay and pay dearly. As God is my witness if it takes me the rest of my life and my last breath on this earth somebody will pay. If money means more to people any more than human life, then God help us all. In my personal opinion I think its about time someone started showing some leader(cid:173)ship instead of dragging the country and the people down farther than it is now. If this country wants peace so bad and we are going to be independent by 1980 as Mr. Nixon preaches, how come we are not a neutral country like some others? Instead of preach(cid:173)ing peace all over the world like a hippocrit with a hand of friendship extended while the other one is holding a A-bomb behind his back. As the fellow says, \"Don't make much sense do it?\" Instead of always being first to stick our noses into somebody else problems, why not devote a little more effort into solv(cid:173)ing some of our own that exist here and now in this country?

Mr. President, I wish associate myself with the remarks made by the distinguished Senator from Virginia concerning the death of a very fine American, Lewis Strauss. It is most appropriate, I suggest, that note be taken in this body of his passing because it was in this body where, per(cid:173)haps, the greatest disappointment of his life came to Lewis Strauss. I refer to the rejection by the Senate of his nomina(cid:173)tion as Secretary of Commerce in the Eisenhower administration. Although I did not serve in the Senate then, I studied the circumstances sur(cid:173)rounding that incident at the time when Mr. Fortas was nominated to be Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The action of the Senate with respect to Lewis Strauss was most unfortunate, in my view, because, as nearly as I could determine, Mr. Strauss was rejected not because of a lack of qualifications, not because of any problems concerning im(cid:173)propriety or anything of that kind, but primarily because there were many in this body who did not agree with his philosophy. That was a sad episode in the life of Mr. Strauss, and I suggest that it was an unfortunate episode in the history of the Senate. Along with the distinguished Senator from Virginia, I regarded Mr. Strauss as a most able, most capable and dedi(cid:173)cated public servant, who contributed a great deal to this Nation. I join the Sen(cid:173)ator from Virginia in extending condo(cid:173)lences to those he leaves behind. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further morning business? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The second assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD.

ORDER FOR THE PRINTING OF EULOGIES\u00b7To THE LATE SENATOR ALLEN ELLKNDER AS A SENATE DOCUMENT Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, the period for the delivery of eulogies for Senator Allen Ellender, through some inadvertent oversight, was never closed, and the authorization for the printing of those eulogies was never granted. I ask unanimous consent that the period for the delivery of eulogies for our late col(cid:173)league, Senator Ellender of Louisiana, be closed, and that the eulogies be printed in a bound volume as a Senate document. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. THE AMERICAN ROLE IN MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATIONS Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, the agreement between Egypt and Israel to realine their military forces along the Suez Canal and the Sin~,i is a significant development in the quest for a perma(cid:173)nent peace in the Middle East. Though this agreement is only the first step down what may be long road of negotiation, it marks the first time that Egypt and Israel have been able to reach an agreement on anything other than a cease-fire. Though Egypt is only one of the Arab nations involved in the troubled Middle East situation, Premier Sadat's willingness to negotiate with the Israel Government is a hopeful sign that the other Arab countries will follow suit. Al(cid:173)ready, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria has made proposals for beginning troop separation talks with Israel. Secretary of State Kissinger has de(cid:173)scribed the Syrian President's overtures to Israel as \"very constructive,\" on both the troop disengagement talks and on a final peace settlement. For the first time since the 6-day war, it appears that there are reasons for genuine optimism that the Middle East impasse will be broken, and that the governments of the coun(cid:173)tries concerned may be replacing emo(cid:173)tional intransigence by constructive pragmatism. If subsequent negotiations proceed as smoothly as have the initial stages, an appreciable share of the credit must go to the efforts that have been made by the Government of the United States bringing the opposing interests together. The President, Secretary of State Kis(cid:173)singer and his staff, are to be commended for their untiring dedication toward helP(cid:173)ing bring about a solution of a problem that has international as well as local implications. If and when a permanent peace settle(cid:173)ment is arrived at in the Middle East(cid:173)and with that settlement there is re(cid:173)moved one of the most dangerous threats to peace in the world-President Nixon, Secretary Kissinger, and American diplo(cid:173)macy in general will have reason to be proud of the parts they have played. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD.

            "254": "254 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 22, 1971, REPORT CHALLENGED On August 27, Simon a former Wall Street securities dealer, expanded on those themes in a 63-page report prepared by his staff rebutting many of the conclusions and facts of an FI'C staff report on the oil industry. Among the conclusions about the FI'C re(cid:173)port made by Simon's staff analysis: \"Many of the facts in the FTC report are inaccurate. Consequently, the resulting conclusions are questionable . . . the FI'C report is biased against the largest integrated oU companies . . . As a result of this bias, the FI'C's final conclusions are incorrect or misleading at best . . . The FI'C should re(cid:173)consider its action and withdraw the com(cid:173)plaint issued against the eight largest oil companies.\" The Simon staff analysis in effect exoner(cid:173)ated the oil industry for the present oil shortage and said the crisis was caused by a variety of factors, \"mostly governmental laws and policies.\" Despite Administration pressure, the FI'C is going forward with a full inquiry into the operations of the eight oil companies. As for the inquiry itself, however, crucial prehearing conferences where attorneys for both sides argue the merits of the complaint will be held in secret because the aU com(cid:173)panies object to opening the sessions to the public. Under FI'C rules, such conferences can be opened to the public if both sides agree to it. In a motion filed Nov. 5, Robert E. Lied(cid:173)quist, FI'C complaint counsel, requested that the prehearlng conferences be opened to the public. He wrote: \"The prehearing conferences in a case of this size and complexity will obviously be a very important and significant phase of the litigation. \"The 'simpllfl.cation and clarification of the issues' which can be expected to result from the conferences will no doubt shape the whole course of the proceeding. \"We do not believe that matters as serious as this should be dealt with outside of pub(cid:173)lic security. Public interest in this case is very great. It has been stimulated not only by the gasoline shortage of this summer and the expected heating fuel shortage this winter but also by the respondents \u2022 (oil companies) own massive advertising and public relations campaign concerning the energy issue. \"In this context we believe that it would be most unWise for the prehearing confer(cid:173)ences to be conducted in secret, and we therefore urge the respondents to join with us in asking that they be made public.\" REJEcr OPEN HEAlliNGS Within 11 days, seven of the eight com(cid:173)panies named in the complaint flatly rejected the idea of opening the hearings. Typical of the companies' answers was this response from MobU: \"Mobil on Corporation does not agree to public prehea.ring conferences in this mat(cid:173)ter.\" This position contrasts sharply with a Mobn 011 Corp. advertisement published in the New York Times last July 10, in the form of a letter addressed to New York's two Sen(cid:173)ators and 12 Congressmen. \"We are pubUshlng this letter in your hometown newspaper, and 1n those of the other members of CongreSB, because we want you and your constituents to have the facts about the gasoline shortage as we see them\" the advertisement stated. \"We are doing this because many people are being misled by the absolute nonsense, totally unsupported charges, and outright lles being spread around by a variety of peo(cid:173)ple.\" At the same time the Nixon admin1stration was trying to get the Justice Department to grant antitrust and conflict of interest im(cid:173)munity to oil company executives, White House aides were at work on Capitol Hill at(cid:173)tempting to arrange the same kind of protec(cid:173)tion through legislation. When the Energy Emergency Act legisla(cid:173)tion was being considered by separate com(cid:173)mittees in the House and Senate, Sen. Hart's antitrust and monopoly subcommittee draft(cid:173)ed proposed language for the antitrust sec(cid:173)tion and submitted it to House and Senate committees. Most parties agreed that such a section was needed to permit the government to appoint or seek the advice of oil industry personnel in carrying out the emergency petroleum al(cid:173)location program. The section submitted by Senator Hart's staff sought to closely define activities that would be included in the antitrust immunity and wrote into the legislation safeguards against abuses. Hart's version provided for public participa(cid:173)tion in all m~etings and verbatim transcripts, set a specific date for termination of the im(cid:173)munity and required Justice Department otncials to prevent any monopolistic prac(cid:173)tices. However, most of these or similar limiting provisions were bargained away by the Sen(cid:173)ate Interior Committee, headed by Sen. Henry Jackson (D., Wash.) in negotiations with the administration. By the time the bill reached the Senate floor and was finally approved, most of the safeguards had been eliminated or weakened. But in the House of Representatives, a Congressional aide told The Inquirer, the ad(cid:173)minlstration failed to make a major effort to get its bill approved. result, many of the anti-trust safe(cid:173)guards proposed by Hart's subcommittee, along with other provisions imposing con(cid:173)trols over the administration's handling of the energy crisis, were retained in the Emer(cid:173)gency Energy Act passed by the House on Dec.14. As for how the administration finally wUl deal with the antitrust issue, James E. Merna, a public information otncer in the Federal Energy Otfice, reported: \"We are kind o! hazy on that. We should find out.\" While both the Senate and the House failed to tackle the problem o! excess profits in the oU industry during a time of ahortages and rationing, President Nixon announced his own plan last week for what he described as a \"windfall profits\" tax. What the Prealdent was labeling a wind(cid:173)fall profits tax, though, actually was an ex(cid:173)tax that would fall hardest on small cise independent on producers and refiners. The President's proposal--calling for graduated tax on the selling price of a bar(cid:173)rel of crude on-would have llttle effect on the major oU companies and especially those operSiting abroad like the five le.rgest interna(cid:173)tional on compe.n:ies. As a a CAN SHD\"l' PROJ'ITS That is because these companies are tully integrated, that Is they engage in all phases of the petToleum business--from productian of crude oil to refl.nlng and marketing. With this kind of fiexlbility, a large com(cid:173)pany can shift its profits from one segment of \u00b7tts operations to another, avoiding the im(cid:173)pact of the adm1ntstrat1on's proposed tax. \u00bbut an independent producer or reftner, whose income Is derived solely from produc(cid:173)tion or refining of crude on, would be espe(cid:173)cially hard hit by the tax. If any of this activity over antitrust im(cid:173)munity for on companies in times of cris1s, amidst rising prices and proflts, sounds fa(cid:173)miliar, that's because it has all happened before. During the blockade of the Suez Canal in 1956-57, when on shipments from the Middle East to Europe were disrupted, the Justice. Department speedUy granted antitrust im(cid:173)munity to major oil companies, allowing them to pool their on sources and work to(cid:173)gether in supplying oil to Europe. In a Senate hearing in 1957, the late Sen. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee questioned an Interior Department otncial about the huge profits the companies would make by pooling their efforts during the crisis. Interior Otnci&l-\"We have nothing to do sir, with the profits of any of the oil com(cid:173)panies.\" Sen. Kefauver-\"You are going to stand by and let them make any exorbitant amount of profit out of this voluntary arrangement that you sponsored.\" Interior Otnclal-\"As I said before, seW~~tor, we have nothing to do with prices.\" Sen. Kefauver-\"! must say that 1t is un(cid:173)believable that you take this attitude, I just can't conceive of a man heading up this orga(cid:173)nlzaition . . . maklng an arrangement tha.t these companies have taken advantage of to make an enormously large profit at the ex(cid:173)pense of the American consumer, and you do nothing about it and express no interest in it. It is inconceivable to me.\" U.S. FuEL OIL SUPPLIES BULGING--RESERVES UP 23 PERCENT IN A YEAR (By Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele) The oil indus try has stockpiled enough oil to get the country almost through Feb(cid:173)ruary--even if all refineries were shut down tomorrow and if homeewners and business would not turn back their thermostats. As of Dec. 21, the supply of home heating: oil, kerosene and other distillate fuels stored. by oil companies totaled 203 million barrels(cid:173)up 23 percent over the 165 million barrels. on hand one year earlier. That is enough fuel oil to last for 58 days. (or to Feb. 17) , according to estimates made(cid:173)by the America-n Petroleum Institute (API) .. an industry trade organization. The esti(cid:173)mates are based on demand figures calculated by the U. S. Bureau of Mines. For this time of year, the 203 million(cid:173)barrel supply (there are 42 gallons in a bar(cid:173)rel) represents, in terms of volume, one or the largest stockplles of distillate !uel oil in. the nation's history. This is the situation in the wake of a series. of statements by the Federal government. urging homeowners and businesses alike to. turn back their thermostats or else risk living. and working in homes and otnces without: heat. In a nationwide television address last Nov_ 25, President Nixon first stressed the need for allocating ~uel oil, saying the government. planned to reduce supplies to industry by 10. percent, to homeowners by 15 percent and to(cid:173)commercial establishments by 25 percent. \"For the average American family,\" the President sald, \"this cutback in heating o11 does not mean severe discomfort for anyone, but it wUl mean that everyone should lower the thermostat ... by six degrees below its. normal setting.\" The goal was to achieve a national daytim&. average of 68 degrees. The President warned .. \"Those who taU to adopt such a cutback risk running out of fuel be!bre the winter(cid:173)isover.\" A fact sheet, distributed by the White(cid:173)House before that speech, estimated\u00b7 that the. shortage of dtstmate fuel oil would ave~ about 900,000 barrels a day during the com(cid:173)Ing winter months. That was an increase of 100 percent over the projected shortage reported a little more than two weeks earller in another White House fact sheet, when the shortage was placed at 450,000 barrels a day. At the time~. Nixon announced his fuel on allOC&Ition program, the adminlstration '8 otl DOlley experts predicted that the overall ",

Wilderness Society. Wildlife Management Institute. They are all in favor of a higher dis(cid:173)count rate than the discount rate my amendment provides. Ex-Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall responded to the Council's pro(cid:173)posed 7 percent rate in these words: Especially noteworthy are the proposals to set the discount rate at a much more realistic level than exists under present guidelines and the much greater recognition given to pre(cid:173)serving environmental guidelines. I think that we all recognize that Mr. Udall was not only a great Secretary of the Interior who understood the impor(cid:173)tance of these projects, because he came from a State that benefited greatly from these projects, but he is also one. of tt;te most outstanding environmentalists m this country or anywhere else. And, as I say, he favors a discount rate of 7 per(cid:173)cent or higher. The next question is why should we apply this rate to past and present pub(cid:173)lic works projects as well as future au(cid:173)thorizations? Frankly, a much more rea(cid:173)sonable question would seem to b~ whY shouldn't we? Why should w_e g1ve a public works project ~ bre~k s1mply be(cid:173)cause it was authorlZed m, say, 1962, while a project authorized next year suf(cid:173)fers? Certainly there is no excuse for not applying the 6%-percent rate. to t~e projects authorized by the pendmg bill. The new standard was promulgated last October. Why in the world shouldn't it apply to projects approved since that date? , Frankly I can think of only one answer to this last question, and it is not a very good answer. If we applied the new higher rate to projects included in the pending bill a number of marginal proj(cid:173)ects simply would not qualify. Of course, they should not qualify. If they cannot meet a standard considerably more lenient than the one used in the market(cid:173)place, there is no reason in the world why the taxpayer should be asked to sub(cid:173)sidize them. They are economic cripples and should be treated as such. Even at a lower rate many of these projects are very questionable. Why? Be(cid:173)cause certain benefits are added to the total picture that should not be counted at all. A sterling example is future fiood control benefits. Many of the projects included in the bill are promoted on the ground that they would result in more intensive flood plain development. For example, the basic justification of the Days Creek Lake project comes from de(cid:173)velopment related to construction that will take place at a later date and will be located in the former flood plain. Yet the use of ftood plain development benefits violates sound land use principles. It also happens to run counter to the recom(cid:173)mendations of the National Water Commission. But how about projects authorized be(cid:173)fore the effective date of the newly ap(cid:173)proved 6% percent discount rate? Why should they have to be reevaluated in terms of the new rate? First let me make it clear that my amendment does not require these older projects to be reevaluated. It simply per(cid:173)mits it. The language of my amendment would allow the executive branch tore(cid:173)evaluate the older projects if such a re(cid:173)evaluation was felt to be appropriate. This is in sharp contrast to the la:1guage of the bill as it was reported from com(cid:173)mittee, which would require the use of discount rates as low as 3% percent and, in effect, prohibits a reevaluation. ' Over 80 percent of those commenting on the new standards proposed by the U.S. Water Resources Council believed that these standards should be .pplied to projects previously authorized as well as future projects. This is the way the Council summarized comments on retro(cid:173)activity: Projects are not ends in themselves, but means for achieving our national goals. These Principles and Standards reflect the fact that our goals have changed. Our public works program must now dovetail with :these new goals; otherwise, the program ceases to serve its national purpose. This, it' seems, is elementary .... Projects which do not con(cid:173)form with the new goals do not serve the national interest. This, it seems to me, is elementary. There is also a good dollars and cents reason why a realistic discount rate should be applied to all authorized public works projects--whether the proj(cid:173)ects were authorized 10 years ago or yesterday. It would save the taxpayer literally billions of dollars. The Water Resources Congress has estimated that a 7 -percent discount rate would kill 50 percent of the projects already author(cid:173)ized. Since the dollar value of these authorizations is $11.9 billion the savings to the American public could be more than $5 billion. Keep in mind that these are projects that simply cannot be justi(cid:173)fied as providing benefits eoual to their cost under current standards. Should we fail to pass my amendment some projects will be built on the basis of a 3%-percent discount rate. This is a ludicrously low figure when we consider that the Federal Government has to pay almost 7 percent--twicP. as much-to borrow the money that finances these public works projects. The return on those dollars would be only half what we pay for them. This brings me to my next point. Let us consider the fact that projects au(cid:173)thorized on the basis of discount rates ranging from 3% to 5% percent will have to compete With future projects based on a 6% percent discount rate. Does this make any sense in allocating scarce Fed(cid:173)eral dollars? Why should a State or re(cid:173)gion suffer because the discount rate ap(cid:173)plied to a project in that region is twice to the discount rate applied to a competing project that never should have been au(cid:173)thorized, and would not have been if the higher discount rate had been in effect at the time of authorization? The an(cid:173)swer is obvious. This is economic discrim(cid:173)ination of the worst sort. And I might add that any of my colleagues short(cid:173)sighted enough vote against my amendment because it would have an adverse impact on one or two projects in their State may find that they are sow(cid:173)ing the seeds of destructive public policy in the future as good projects in their State go by the boards while less justifi(cid:173)able programs are pursued. Some may argue that my amendment would adversely affect projects author(cid:173)ized many years ago as part of a system of water resource projects, thus adversely affecting an entire program. Or it may be possible to point to communities that have relied on a previously authorized project, to their detriment if the project is not constructed. That is exactly why I have left it up to the executive branch agencies to make the decision as to whether or not to apply the new discount rate of older projects. This will permit the flexibility needed to take account of mitigating circumstances. Finally let me point out that the death of an ineflicien t project does not mean that a particular erosion or flood control problem can never be resolved. There are many ways to skin a cat. There are all sorts of solutions to individual ftood con(cid:173)trol problems. Some of them may be less costly and have a lesser impact on the environment than a project authorized 5 or 10 years ago. My amendment would focus attention on these alternative solu(cid:173)tions. Before I conclude I want to make it clear that my amendment articulates and represents the administration's posi(cid:173)tion on the subject. In order to drive this point home I would like to quote from a news release put out by the Water Resources Council last August announc(cid:173)ing the new planning criteria for the Nation's water resources. These criteria include the discount rate formula imple(cid:173)mented by my amendment--the formula that the Senate Public Works Commit(cid:173)tee has attempted to nullify through the language contained in section 65 of the bill. Here is what the President said about the new standards, including the new discount formula: The Principles and Standards \". . . repre(cid:173)sent the culmination of several years review by the Water Resources Council to develop improved planning criteria to achieve our goal of wise use of the Nation's water and related land resources with full consideration to the protection of our environment. I com(cid:173)mend the Water Resources Counc11 for ac(cid:173)complishing such a difficult task.\" Secretary of the Interior Morton had this to say about the new discount rate formula: It is felt that the discount rate provision will foster the planning of better programs and projects for a given level of Federal investment. In order to make it crystal clear that my amendment and the administration's position are identical I would like to ",

The drilling equipment is in place, the derricks are pumping, and oil is flowing out of the ground. The COLC did say on December 19, 1973, that the increased prices on \"old\" crude, while generating \"only marginal increments to crude supply in the short run,\" will \"create additional incentive for the petroleum industry to pursue fur(cid:173)ther research and development efforts, new exploration and new technology to augment our energy resources.\" -What an expensive and inefficient way to go about it. The price of \"new\" crude is decontrolled, and runs between $8 and $10 a barrel. Rising world prices will pull up \"new\" domestic crude still further. This is plenty of incentive-there is no need to give the oil companies two unre(cid:173)lated additional bonanzas on \"old\" crude-price hikes and release for \"matching\" barrels of \"old\" crude. H.R. !2214's purpose is to: First roll back the price of \"old\" crude to May 15, 1973, levels. adjusted to re(cid:173)flect actual production cost increases since then; and Second, eliminate the provision releas(cid:173)ing a barrel of \"old\" crude for each bar(cid:173)rel of \"new\" produced. Neither independent producers-those with crude production of less than 20,000 barrels a day-nor stripper wells-as under present regulations-would be subject to price controls. Under this bill, companies whose cost of producing \"old\" oil has genuinely in(cid:173)creased-perhaps because they have re(cid:173)sorted to more expensive secondary and tertiary recovery methods-will be al(cid:173)lowed a dollar-for-dollar cost pass(cid:173)through. But increases in price will be granted only on a case-by-case basis, where need is proven. We must keep our heads, despite the rhetoric and uncertainties of the energy crisis. We want to increase production and particularly exploration-not only of oil, but of alternative energy sources, not only by major oil companies, but by other producers, But we also want to find the most efficient and anti-inflation(cid:173)ary way of doing so. There is every rea(cid:173)son both in economic theory and in ac(cid:173)tuai example, to believe that allowing \"new\" crude to be sold at a high and rising market price is sufficient incen(cid:173)tive without hiking the effective price \u2022~old'' crude too.

Under a previous order of the House, the gentle(cid:173)man from Iowa (Mr. CULVER) 1s recog(cid:173)nized for 5 minutes. Mr. CULVER. Mr. Speaker, whlle we were scattered in our districts during the recess a political earthquake occur(cid:173)red in Iowa, the tremors of which had perceptible effects across the Nation. I am sure that the instigator of these shocks deliberately chose to set them off at a time of congressional dispersion, since otherwise we would all have been too stunned. For all of u8 know that the House of Representatives operates through a delicate system of checks and balances, about one of which the House rules are silent. I refer, of course, to that majestic and rock-like institution, H. R. GROSS. In announcing his intention to retire from the House at the end of his current term, H. R. GRoss is removing one of the pillars on which our legislative proce(cid:173)dures are built. In taking away this bul(cid:173)wark he imposes a heavy responsibility on all those who remain in this body to compensate for a large vacancy. H. R. embodies not only a unique and memor(cid:173)able personality; he also brought dis(cid:173)tinction to the legislative craft. There is probably not a member here who has not at some time left the floor with the conviction that H. R. saved them from foolish or inadvertent legis(cid:173)lative error. There is no one in this body who has not marvelled at his command of legislative intricacies or at his profes(cid:173)sional skill in the reading of fine print. Moreover H. R. has always exhibited the values of a firm grounding in arithmetic and vocabulary. He always recognizes the difference between $1 million and $1 billion-and even the difference between 1 and 10. His mastery of the active verb and the telling adjective are also legendary. As one of his colleagues from Iowa, I have profited from his example and earthy wisdom however much I have disagreed with a good many of the policy conclusions he has reached. But even in disagreement H. R. is the kind of man who at least makes colleagues less smug in their beliefs and readier to see the possibilities of error. H. R. GRoss has made this a livelier and better place in which to do the Na(cid:173)tion's.business. He will leave with univer(cid:173)sal affection and with our delight that we have been both the objects of his vigilance and the beneficiaries of his good will. HEARING SET ON VOTING RIGHTS OF EX-OFFENDERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentle(cid:173)man from Wisconsin <Mr. KAsTENMEIER) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Speaker, the Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice has scheduled a hearing on H.R. 9020, and a number of identical measures to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1970 to prohibit the States from denying the right to vote in Federal elections former criminal offenders who have not been convicted of any offense relating to voting or elections and who are not confined in a correctional institution. The legislation was introduced by me and has been cosponsored by 27 other Members of the House. Its purpose to prohibit the States from denying the right to vote in Federal elections to former criminal offenders who have not been convicted of an offense relating to voting and who are not incarcerated. The denial of the right to vote to citi(cid:173)zens who have been convicted of a crim(cid:173)inal offense is a significant obstance to to is that right by the full enjoyment of American citizens. The blll sets forth findings supporting the constitutional foundation of this legislation. A question is raised by the very recent Supreme Court decision in O'Brien against Skinner whether the bill can constitutionally provide, as it purports to do, that incarceration in a correc(cid:173)tional institution deprives the inmate of his right to vote. Also, it has been pro(cid:173)posed that the protection of the blll should be extended to State and local elections. The subcommittee will study the legislation with great care. The hearing will be held at 10 a.m., on Wednesday, January 30, 1974, in room 2226, Rayburn House Office Build(cid:173)ing. Witnesses will be heard from the Department of Justice, the U.S. Com(cid:173)mission on Civil Rights, and the Ameri(cid:173)can Bar Association. UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen(cid:173)tleman from New York (Mr. STRATTON) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. STRATTON. Mr. Speaker, at a time when Alexander Solzhenitsyn's brilliant new work on Soviet concentra(cid:173)tion camps has focused world attention on the repressive practices of the Soviet Union over the years, it is especially ap(cid:173)propriate to remember the valiant and hardworking people of the Ukraine who have been struggling against these poli(cid:173)cies for over half a century. For most of the\u00b7 past 300 years the Ukraine has been submerged in the mas(cid:173)sive Russian state and for most of those years, the Ukrainian people battled val(cid:173)iantly against czars and later Commu(cid:173)nists in an effort to win the inalienable rights of people everywhere, namely per(cid:173)sonal and political freedom. For just one bright, shining moment, when czarist authority was first smashed in 1917 the Ukrainian people were able to gain their freedom and create their own state. That interlude began on Jan(cid:173)uary 22, 1918, and ended 5 short years later, when Bolshevik occupation finally took over. Today, 56 years later, Ukrainians are still in political and intellectual bond(cid:173)age. Their brief taste of independence evaporated all too quickly. But even though the independent State of the Ukraine is only a memory today, the spirit of freedom stlll burns brightly in the minds and hearts of all Ukrainian people everywhere. In this era of detente with the Soviet Union, we must never forget that the leaders in the Kremlin are still sup(cid:173)pressing the legitimate hopes and aspi(cid:173)rations of the Ukrainian people for free(cid:173)dom and self-determination. Yet this suppression has merely served to strengthen the spirit and the resolve of the people of the Ukraine. And it is this brave spirit which we commemorate to(cid:173)day, on the anniversary of Ukrainian independence, and which we deeply be(cid:173)lieve will eventually bring the Ukraine back into the world community again as a free and independent state. I know that in my own upstate New ",

But irra.tiona.Uty is the easy way out. No matter how much it hurts, we have to con(cid:173)sider any and all evidence which may be germane to the issue. Of course, we could withdraw from the issue entirely. But, as MaUer said at this conference, that would make us less interesting as human beings. And being mired in secrecy would make our society a frightful place. THE RULE OF LAW HON. WILLIAM L. HUNGATE OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, January 22, 1974 Mr. HUNGATE. Mr. Speaker, the De(cid:173)cember 1973 issue of the American Bar Association Journal strongly supports the principle of independence of prosecu(cid:173)tion. Citing the chain of events surround(cid:173)ing the Watergate Special Prosecutor, the article reaflirmed the ABA's position that the Special Prosecutor must be wholly independent of the executive branch of Government: THE RULE OF LAW The deep attachment of the American people to the principle of the rule of law and not of men could not have been exem(cid:173)plified better than by the outpouring of pub(cid:173)lic disapproval that greeted President Nixon's action in late October when he declined to follow the adverse Watergate tapes decision of the court of appeals and then dismissed the special prosecutor for refusing to temper his investigation and to accept the president's alternative to turning over the tapes. The publlc outrage, which political re(cid:173)porters have said was not expected by the president, demonstrated that the people have an ingrained trust in and respect for our system of justice as administered by fear(cid:173)less and independent judges and lawyers, and that they feel that the established judicial means for the settlement of disputes are to be preferred over methods grounded on poli(cid:173)tical power and position. These events serve to point out again the awesome yet integral role the legal profession plays in our na(cid:173)tion's life, and they should be the occasion for a reaffirmation of our determination to fulfill that role. It is elementary that the investigation and prosecution of wrongdoing must be inde(cid:173)pendent, free of conflicts of interest, and not subject to the influence of those who might fall under suspicion and investigation. This problem was present from the beginning in the investigation and prosecution of the events that comprise what ha.s been called \"Watergate,\" but it became more acute as higher officials were implicated last April. Robert W. Meserve, then president of the American Bar Association, told a National Press Club luncheon on Aprll 30 that an \"in(cid:173)dependent special prosecutor, having no con(cid:173)nection with the government or any of the parties in the case, should be appointed to direct the grand jury inquiry and any crim(cid:173)inal prosecution that might result.\" After referring to the Code of Professional Re(cid:173)sponsibllity and the Standards Relating to the Prosecution and the Defense Functions, Mr. Meserve added that the \"appointment EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS of a special prosecutor of recognized profes(cid:173)sional stature and integrity would do much to clear the air and reassure the country that the facts will be brought out and those involved dealt with fully and fairly.\" The special prosecutor's office as estab(cid:173)lished was a part of the Justice Department, a circumstance that did not remove the in(cid:173)herent anomaly of investigatee having ulti(cid:173)mate dismissal power over investigator. But the Senate was satisfied with the assurance of the new attorney general, Elllot L. Rich(cid:173)ardson, that the prosecutor would have an unusual degree of independence and could not be removed except for \"extraordinary 1m(cid:173)proprieties,\" which would be determined by the attorney general. These assurances were expressed in \"guidelines\" that became the foundation of the special prosecution force. This compact between the executive branch and the people was abrogated by the president in late October when he directed Archibald Cox, who had been appointed spe(cid:173)cial prosecutor, \"to make no further attempts by judicial process to obtain tapes, notes, or memoranda of presidential conversations,\" discharged Mr. Cox when he refused to accept this interference in his prosecutorial func(cid:173)tion, and abolished the independent status of the prosecution force. Mr. Richardson did not find Mr. Cox guilty of \"extraordinary im(cid:173)proprieties.\" Indeed, he declined to discharge the special prosecutor and himself resigned. Neither President Nixon nor anyone for him has charged Mr. Cox with \"extraordinary improprieties.\" In a statement issued October 22, Chester(cid:173)field Smith, president of the Association, declared that President Nixon's actions were an \"intolerable assault upon the courts, our first line of defense against tyranny and ar(cid:173)bitrary power .... I express my hope and confidence that the judicia.! and legislative forces of this nation will act swiftly and de(cid:173)cisively to challenge, repeal, and correct this damaging incursion . . . upon the system of justice and therefore upon the basic lib(cid:173)erties of the citizens of this country.\" A few days later the Association's Board of Gov(cid:173)ernors endorsed Mr. Smith's statement and went on record favoring the re-establish(cid:173)ment of the office of the special prosecutor by appointment of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. (For the text of the resolution and the statement, see the article on page 1389 of this issue.) The principle of independence of prosecu(cid:173)tion is one that needs to be remembered and preserved. No better successor for Mr. Cox could have been selected than Leon Jaworski, the former president of the American Bar Association, whose appointment was an(cid:173)nounced on November 1. But the question is not one of men but of independence of the prosecutoria.l function. In the unusual cir(cid:173)cumstances of this situation, that principle requires a prosecutor not beholden in any way to the executive branch of government. HON. DOLPH BRISCOE, GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, ADDRESSES THE TEXAS AGRICULTURAL EXPERI(cid:173)MENT STATION STAFF HON. OLIN E. TEAGUE OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, January 22, 1974 Mr. TEAGUE. Mr. Speaker, it was my pleasure to be in attendance at a staff conference of Texas Agricultural Experi(cid:173)ment employees on Wednesday, Janu(cid:173)ary 9, 1974, at College Station, Tex. The Governor of Texas, the Honorable Dolph Briscoe, delivered the main address, and January 22, 1974 I am pleased to include the text of Gov(cid:173)ernor Briscoe's remarks: REMARKS BY Gov. DOLPH BRISCOE Thank you for a kind and generous intro(cid:173)duction. I know of no other place where I feel more at home than I do with you. For a great num(cid:173)ber of years I have worked closely with you and I know personally the great contribution the men and women of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station have made to the prog(cid:173)ress of Texas. Working with your partners-(cid:173)the Texas Agricultural Extension Service-(cid:173)the many lasting benefits of research have been carried to the people of this State, and as a result of these efforts, all Texans have enjoyed a more abundant life. President Williams, I would like to thank you, Dean H. 0. Kunkel, Directors Mlller and Hutchinson and the many dedicated mem(cid:173)bers of this university staff both here and in the field for our favorable position in agri(cid:173)culture. Of course, many of you hold joint teaching appointments and I express appre \u2022 elation also to those dedicated teachers who are training the young men and women who will lead agriculture and home economics in the future. Dr. Wllliams, in my opinion the land grant university concept of teaching, research and extension is one of America's great achieve(cid:173)ments. I hope that the high priorities given to agriculture and rural life in the past will be accelerated in the future. You are assured of my continued support for your efforts. You are aware that one of the goals of my ad.ministration is to make Texas Number One in Agriculture, not only in volume of sales but in profits to the farmers and ranchers of this State. If we achieve this goal then we all must accelerate our efforts. I believe no one could be engaged in a more exciting ca(cid:173)reer than in today's dynamic agriculture. Agriculture is really the great hope of our country. Not only does it feed and clothe our people but agriculture has become the one tool with which we can compete most effi(cid:173)ciently in foreign markets. Dean Kunkel, in his annual report mes(cid:173)sage, said \"an agronomist can no longer be concerned only with producing the seed, but he has to be part of the team concerned with the disposal of the straw.\" Yes, the agrono(cid:173)mist has to be a team member. You are de(cid:173)veloping a team approach and I congratulate you on the strides you are making. The four(cid:173)teen designated research and extension cen(cid:173)ters, one of which is located in my home town of Uvalde, provide truly effective multi(cid:173)disciplinary task forces, dedicating their ef(cid:173)forts toward solution to the problems of the areas in which they are located. The con(cid:173)duct of research by the station is organized into projects which outline objectives. This provides for necessary coordination to insure that the most important priority problems are being investigated and prevents costly and unnecessary duplication. The Research and Extension Centers and dynamic area de(cid:173)velopment programs such as B.E.T., B.I.G., P.E.P., South Plains, E1 Paso, Rolllng Plains and the new one just recently organized at Uvalde can continue to make Texas agricul(cid:173)ture a leading economic and social base for a more prosperous Texas. After all, the prin(cid:173)ciple measure of research success is the im(cid:173)pact that research has had on the economy and well being of the people of the State. No one would deny that Texas agriculture and its associated supplying, processing a.nd distributing industries have been trans(cid:173)formed. dramatically in recent years. And agricultural research has been the basis for every change--the new varieties of cotton, rice, vegetables and grain sorghums, the modern fertilization practices, the new equipment and processes, the new manage(cid:173)ment and cultural practices, the new live(cid:173)stock rations and feeding systems. As only one measure of value of agricultural research ",

Reductions in car heating levels, station lighting, shorter off-peak train lengths and the like, handled with careful explanations to the public wm make transit an even more efficient user of energy. Longer range conservation efforts are also underway, including technological research to minimize energy consumption. My own agency, for ex(cid:173)ample, is doing research and development on an energy recapture and storage system for subway cars. Our objective is to reduce power consumption and lower the heat levels in our tunnels by making use of the energy now dispatched through resistor grids during braking. In fact, the existence of highly developed transit systems in a few of our metropolitan areas-such as Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco-(cid:173)may prove over the next few years to be a national economic asset. These cities have, through their own investment of capital and through continuing operating assistance, pre(cid:173)served an important means of mobillty. Hope(cid:173)fully, they will be joined in a few years by other cities--Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Bal(cid:173)timore and perhaps others-who have made such a commitment in partnership with the Federal government. Another group--includ(cid:173)ing New Orleans. San Antonio and Seattle have extensive and well-run bus systems serv(cid:173)ing a significant portion of the local popula(cid:173)tion. Each of these cities wm be better able to move their people--and keep alive econom(cid:173)ically-if curtailment of automobile traffic through gasoline rationing or to meet air quality standards becomes a reality. Because they kept their public transportation systems alive and improved or expanded them when(cid:173)ever possible, these communities have achieved at least some balance in transporta(cid:173)tion and reduced their dependencies on the private automobile. When the crunch comes, those cities and regions which have highly(cid:173)developed public transportation systems are going to be in a very strong competitive po(cid:173)sition vis-a-vis those new and less fortunate areas which grew up in the automobile age. They will also be far ahead of unfortunate communities which lost their bus and ran systems in a search for a new model or urban development. While we all certainly hope that the energy crisis will not result in widespread economic slowdown, it seems obvious that those areas with presently adequate transit service w111 be better able to respond than those without. The Chicago elevated, the New York subway or the Boston trolley lines are often maligned as obsolete or inhuman or inefficient transportation facillties. While they obviously need much in the way of im(cid:173)provement, their availabillty in the possible crunch that is upon us should go a long way toward st111ing these critics. I would hope that these remarks do not indicate any complacency on our part as transit operators. The prospect of rapid and enforced order of magnitude changes in nat(cid:173)ural travel habits is, in fact, a frightening one in view of the slow pace of the progress we have made to date. In all honesty, we are far from ready, in terms of physical faclllties, financial resources. or policy positions to as(cid:173)sume a dominant role in moving urban Amer(cid:173)ica. With the seriousness of the energy crisis now before us, I believe it is time to marshall all these factors and make the kind of bold commitments that will assure a major role for public transport in achieving energy self(cid:173)~ufficiency for this country. Our recent experience with attempts meet environmental goals which parallel the need to conserve energy suggests the areas 1n which these commitments must focused. In seeking to fulfill air quaUty standards, Federal and State environmental officials have tested the nation's readiness to be to accept massive reductions in auto tramo tion of incremental service to existing lines, similar to those which gasoline shortages but the creation of entire new routes and would enforce.

            "554": "554 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 23, 1974 the MIS reports would probably show a de(cid:173)creasing caseload\" (p. 27, GAO Report). A project 1n Connecticut, for example, recently decided to take no more cases involving di(cid:173)vorce and other family matters so that it could carry on a more extensive program of law reform. It stands to reason that a poor person whose plea for help in obtaining a di(cid:173)vorce was turned down would have qUite a different op1n1on of the project than a client who was successfully defended 1n a land(cid:173)lord-tenant case. One surmises that the GAO sampling of client opinion did not cover those indigent persons who were never al(cid:173)lowed to become clients. It should be noted by the way that dis(cid:173)content over attorney preoccupation with law reform surfaces from time to time even among those persons who have received serv(cid:173)ice. A reference to this problem fs found in an article in the Yale Law Journal in Decem(cid:173)ber 1971 by a staunch defender of the Legal Services Program. He wrote: \"Legal Services attorneys have been known to place a higher priority on some issues ... that are of less consequence to the client community. Moreover on certain issues the interests of the poor and the attorneys may be in direct conflict . . . Recently for exam(cid:173)ple, there have been increasing complaints from clients about attorneys who 'exploit' cltents to launch sweeping law reform actions when the individuals may be seeking much more limited solutions to their problems within existing laws. The clients accuse the attorneys of taking law reform 'ego trips' at their expense. The National Clients Coun(cid:173)cil has begun compiling documentation on this problem and plans to make it a. major issue\". \u2022 The argument is frequently exhumed, of course, that service to clients cannot be separated from law reform since the time and money spent on a test case or class action may pay rich dividends in terms of benefits to many more hundreds of individ(cid:173)ual indigent persons and at far less cost than would have been the case had the proj(cid:173)ect been restricted to serving clients on a one-by-one basis. There are signs that this faclle argument-the short-circuit justifica(cid:173)tion for law reform-is beg1nnlng to grow a Uttle threadbare. A number of observers have begun to underline a little-recognized point: that the alleged benefits of so-called ''impact litigation\" are frequently lllusory.~~ According to one of these observers, Harry Brlll, former Director of Research for the San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Assist(cid:173)ance Foundation, a very large part of the Foundation's Utlgative activity-class action suits--produced not only \"hollow victories\" with no real social or economic gains but were even harmful in diverting scarce re(cid:173)sources away from the direct needs of the poor. Brill's article suggests that the time has come for thorough longitudinal research by the Office of Lega.l Services into the al(cid:173)leged economic benefits of many of the \"landmark\" decisions resulting from test cases brought by poverty lawyers in the past. Such research ought to greatly facilltate the effort to develop a criterion for \"adequate\" law reform involvement. Finally, the question \"When is law re(cid:173)form excessive?\" requires that the catch-all expression \"law reform\" be broken down in(cid:173)to its various components (i.e. legislative ad(cid:173)vocacy. administrative advocacy and high impact lltiga.tlve advocacy), and that each be subjected not only to a cost-benefit anal(cid:173)ysis but equaJ.ly important, each be weighed 1n the sca.les of polltica.l costs in the high(cid:173)est sense of the word \"political\", the sense 1n which the term ls ;associated with con(cid:173)stitutional issues and questions of public policy. Some elements of law reform (for example lobbying lby a speclaJ. Interest group Footnotes at end of article. o1 at pubUc expense) have become extremely controversial. Consequently any judgmenrt on a criterion for adequate involvement by legaJ. services attorneys in law reform must take into account the resolution of the issue of the propriety of the various kinds of law reform.8 The point of the above digression is simply this: the GAO evaluation of the Legal Serv(cid:173)ices Program was severely hampered by the fact that an acceptable criterion of ade(cid:173)quacy 1n respect to the law reform goal of the Program was nowhere to be found, and that GAO was therefore, in order to make any judgments a.t all, forced to rely on the fluctuating and subjective perspectives OEO's contract evaluators who in turn de6 pended, for their view of adequacy, on the personal views of officials who were operat\u00b7 ing the Program. What was \"too little\" fo:r these officia.ls, might be criticized as \"too much\" by others, on grounds equally solid (or equally weak). To make matters worse, not only are GAO's findings based largely on a kind of hearsay, but, by GAO's own admission, there was no possibility of substantiating the findings with any hard data. For one thing, GAO found the Office of Legal Services' Management In(cid:173)formation System (MIS)-the source of hard data--to be in disastrous shape. Not only were many grantees not adhering to report(cid:173)ing requirements (according to one source less than 75% of the grantees were submit(cid:173)ting regular reports) but much of the da.ts. in the reports that were submitted was in(cid:173)complete and inaccurate. Secondly, the MIS report format contained, incredibly, no pro(cid:173)visions to show the accumulation of grantee accomplishments in law reform! According to the GAO Report: \"The MIS report does not reflect the e.mount of effort and results obtained by grantees in law reform (p. 27) . . . (There(cid:173)fore) adequate data. was not available . . . to measure achievements in law reform ... and to compute the average cost for cases handled\" (p. 10, GAO Report). The non-existence of a. system for report(cid:173)ing hard data. in the area of law reform, combined with the non-existence of any gen(cid:173)erally acceptable criterion for determining when law reform involvement was adequate should cool the ardor of those who think the GAO Report has settled the factual issue of the degree of law reform in the Legal Serv(cid:173)ices Program. Nonetheless GAO did come up with an estimate based on what it called \"indications\". These indications consisted of (a) opinions found in previous OEO evalua(cid:173)tions of 26 out of a. total of 265 Legal Services line projects and (b) opinions elicited di(cid:173)rectly by GAO from a.ttorneys and project directors working at the seven sites visited. Of these seven projects, four were found by GAO to be insufficiently engaged in law re(cid:173)form. The following excerpts from the GAO Report cite the \"indications\" on which GAO based its judgment in each of the four cases: 1. Project A: \"A 1970 evaluation reported that law reform activities needed strengthen(cid:173)ing. A grantee official informed us that a heavy oaseload in the area of individual serv(cid:173)ices precluded the grantee from emphasizing law reform\" (p. 18, GAO Report). Comment: As noted above, GAO is relying here not on hard data (statistics, records, etc.) but on a 1970 evaluation and on the subjective assessment of a grantee official. It is not unthinkable that a grantee official's self-evaluation might be motivated 1n part by a desire for increased funding. More im(cid:173)portantly, a later evaluation of this same project conducted 1n March 1971 :mentions \"considerable law reform work\", estimating that about 25% of the project's time is given over to law reform. The GAO -assessment is simply obsolete. 2. Project B: \"A 1969 OEO evaluation re(cid:173)ported that grantee corporations had not Comment: Again markedly implemented the national goal. As of October 1971, only four of the eight law reform units required under its grant were in operation.\" (p. 15, GAO Report). Comment: Again, how relevant ~ a 1969 evaluation to a. Report issued 1n March 1978? An evaluation of Project B conducted for OEO by an outside firm in November 1970 indicated that staff attorneys \"were heavlly involved in community organizing, often at the expense of their caseloads\". Community organizing 1s an activity which ts central to such law reform activities as grassroots lob(cid:173)bying. To lbe sure, 1n October 1971 someone found that only 4 out of 8 law reform units required 'by the nationa.l Office were opera(cid:173)tional. But by what yardstick was GAO able to determine that 8 would not have ibeen excessive? Not only is the question of the propriety of law reform begged, but the ques(cid:173)tion of how much is enough. Besides, 1f it is possl!ble that 4 vigorous and activist units could accomplish more than 8 mediocre ones, ought not a judgment on the effectiveness of law ll'eform to focus on the quaJ.ity and ex(cid:173)tent of the activity of the 4 units? No de(cid:173)scription of Project B's l&w reform activity ts provided, and so the issue is resolved mechan(cid:173)ically by the number of law reform units in operation. 3. Project C: \"The grantee's 1970 self-eval(cid:173)uation report stated that a substantial, effec(cid:173)tive and organized law reform program was lacking. The grantee's executive director re(cid:173)ported in Ma.y and August 1971 that the law reform unit was in a state of flux and not able to produce as much as had been anticipated.\" \u00b7 (a) a. self-evaluation can either exaggerate law reform activity to win praise or underestimate it to win dol(cid:173)lars and (lb) self-evaJ.ua.tions conducted ln 1970 and in August 1971 could hardly lbe ex(cid:173)pected to be current as of March 1978, the date of the GAO Report. In December 1972, OEO had an evaJ.ua.tion of a. signlfl.cant por(cid:173)tion of Project C performed by an outside evaluator who found that fully one fourth of the attorney staff (8 out of 12 attorneys') were devoting themselves full-time to law reform, with a caseload of approximately 45 C'UlTent open cases. In addition the project was active in organiZing the local Welfare Rights Organization and was serving as house counsel for the National Tenants Union. These latter activities are characteristic of projects which are activist and law-reform oriented. 4. Project D: \"A grantee official informed us that the project had not been involved in any significant law reform activities.\" Comment: Here again there is no reference to a mutually agreed upon criterion of what constitutes \"significant\" law reform activity, and there is no indication GAO used any additional informa.tdon, such as an OEO evaluation, a.s a check on the grantee offi(cid:173)cial's opinion. It happens that a.n OEO eval(cid:173)uation conducted in November 1970 agrees with what GAO was told: there was little or no law reform. The reason given by OEO's evaluators is that the director wished to run his program like a. regular law office with service to indigent cltents being the top priority. The GAO Report concedes that each of the three remaining programs was adequately in(cid:173)volved i.n law reform, and this judgment is borne out by self evaluations and by evalua(cid:173)tions conducted by outsiders for OEO. Project E, the Legal Services Program's second largest, was not only adequately in(cid:173)volved in law reform. but heavUy involved, so heavily that the Project was recently the subJect of an article 1n a national journal of opinion faulting it for excessive involvement. Project F is credited by a 1971 OEO evaJ.ua(cid:173)t1on with devoting a.t least 20% of its re(cid:173)sources to law reform, 1n addition to serving as group organizer and house counsel to such ",

When asked about interstate cooperation and coordination Godwin aa.td, \"They are good at coordinating for things like trans(cid:173)portation studies, but the answer 1s \u2022no' for things like water distribution and land use plann1ng.'' Transportation Planner Rex Eads went into further deta.U about the mass transit study. \"OUr transportation district includes LeFlore and Sequoyah counties; right now because or the gas shortage we are working on an emergency publlc transportation plan which w111 be presented. at the Fort Smith Cha.mber of Commerce on Jan. 11. The energy crunch is the result for the emergency plan, but we'll have to be certain that any 1m(cid:173)mediate plans wUl serve both the short term and the long term needs.'' At J.aat we come to the man whose under(cid:173)standing of the magnitude of the job some-' times makes him feel bite out of the side of an elephant-Director of Comprehensive Health Pl.a.nn1ng Bill Powell. To Powell, health is not just the numbers of beds in a hospital, or lxow many doctors or nurses are avaUable. Peraona.l incomes, en(cid:173)vironment, health hazards, housing, product abuse, nutrition, attitudes, technology, edu(cid:173)cation and psychiatry a.ll join together to in(cid:173)fluence the prevention, restoration and main(cid:173)tenance of physical, mental and environ(cid:173)mental health. \"An example or the interrelations involved,\" pointed out Powell \"is the hepatitis outbreak in Scott County a whUe back. It was not fixed through the doctor-nurse syndrome. It waa solved with engineers and a modem water system to replace the septic tanks which were infecting the wells.\" Powell mentioned that he saw W APDD as \"serving as a representative of the indl\u00b7 vidual; to speak and work for the penon who can't do it himself and may be over(cid:173)awed by the professionals.\" \"Yet, you can't stand up and just take over and get anything done, we must remain in the background,\" aa.ld Richard Shew(cid:173)maker, Assistant Director of WAPDD. \"You might be able to get the physical th.lngs done, but you wouldn't accomplish the things that carry it on-Uke the sense of like he 1a tak1ng a FEDERAL GRANTS APPROVED THROUGH WAPDD ASSISTANCE unity In the town or the persona.l tnste.nce. \"The Pederal cutbacks or a couple of yean ago actually strengthened us as planners,\" said Shewmaker. \"lt resulted in more digging, searching tor more than one way to solve a problem, It also instigated. more state interest in local problems. They re-thought what their role should be.\" Shewmaker brought up one of the con(cid:173)tradictions in planning that he had run across. \"Everyone 1s presently putting 1n new sewer systems, using EPA money to meet EPA requirements. 'Nle legialation tnsfstll that by 1977, communities be set up for the secondary trea.tment level. There should be no problem for that deadline. But the legia(cid:173)lation also has written in that, by 1983, com(cid:173)munities be able to treat waste with the tech\u00b7 nologica.l best method at that time. To me this 1s idiotic. EPA is not taking into account tha.t the towns are 1lnanctng a 20-yea.r debt for their new systems and In 1983 w111 be in(cid:173)volved again in a new system, yet w111 have an 11-yea.r debt hanging over their heads. In my opinion. EPA is encouraging you to make a financial mistake.\" \"A few years ago the EPA wanted to clean up everything at once; we would like to plan without waiting for everythtng to fall apart at once\", says Shewmaker.

THE ENERGY CRISIS Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I am calling on the White House to match its energy rhetoric with solid en(cid:173)ergy proposals. The White House is calling for proj(cid:173)ect independence to make this country self-suftlctent by 1980 yet the Federal Energy Oftlce under William Simon will be set up as a temporary. stop-gap meas(cid:173)ure with an authorization for only 18 months. What we need is a National Energy Policy Council capable of long-range planning and collation of energy statis(cid:173)tics. We are in the present crisis because no one was minding the store and the supplies ran out. We cannot solve our present problems without all the facts and we certainly cannot become self(cid:173)sufficient without long-range planning. \u2022",

It would be a serious error to conclude that our problems of over-population would be resolved immediately or in the very near future, even if a.ll parents decided to have no more than two children. The baby \"boom\" is still with us; the bab1es have only grown older a.nd are now having babies of their own. An average of two children per completed family from now on would slow population growth, but would not stop it soon because the number of persons of child(cid:173)bearing age is increasing. In the words of the recent Population Commission Report: 1 Our past rapid growth has given 11. \" \u2022. \u2022 us so many young couples that, to bring population growth to an immediate halt, the birthrate would have to drop by almost 50 percent, and today's young r; neration of parents would have to limit themselves to an average of about one child. That is just not going to happen.\" (p. 15,1italics is mine.) 12. \"Regardless of what happens to the birthrate from now on, our pa:ct growth com(cid:173)mits us to substantial additional growth in the future. At a mtnimum, we will probably add 50 million more Americans by the end of the century, and the figure could easily be much higher than that.\" (p. 115,1 italics is mine.) 13. \"It takes a long time to affect popula(cid:173)tion growth rates 1n a. democratically and ethically acceptable manner.

[From the :New York Times, Sept. 19, 1978] ONE IN THREE WOMEN FAIL ON CONTRACEPTION (By Nancy Hicks) Despite advances 1n birth control tech(cid:173)niques that have sharply lowered the na(cid:173)tion's birth rate, more than a third of the women 1n a national study of couples prac(cid:173)ticing birth control over a five-year period became pregnant anyway, according to a report made public yesterday. The study, an evaluation of birth con(cid:173)trol effectiveness, was extrapolated flam the authoritative 1970 National Fertility Study, directed by Dr. Norman Ryder and Dr. Charles Westoff, sociologists at Princeton University. This portion of the study, conducted by Dr. Ryder, showed that even though birth control devices such as the pill and the in(cid:173)trauterine device (IUD) had cut the risk of contraceptive failure 1n half in the last 10 years, ~at over a tlve-yea.r period, a third of the women who wanted to delay or pre(cid:173)vent conception faUe<l to do so. January 23, 1974 6,782 WOMEN INVOLVED \"The implication of this 1s that we have a substantla.l number of people 1n the United States using ineffective methods of contraception or using effective methods carelessly,\" Dr. Ryder said, adding that Americans did not as yet have adequate control over their reproduction. The findings released yesterday were re\u00b7 ported in the latest issue of Family Plan(cid:173)ning Perspectives, the quarterly journal of the Planned Parenthood Center for Family Plann1ng Program Development, and were based on a national sample of 6,752 married or previously married women. The data showed that within a year's time, 14 per cent of the women studied had an unwanted pregnancy and that 26 per cent get pregnant sooner than they planned. \"People have to get used to the fact that there 1s an awful lot of contraceptive failure 1n a society even as sophisticated as ours,\" Dr. Ryder said in an interview. \"It 1s non\u00b7 sense to say that Americans are now having the number of children that they want.\" ... [From [From Parade, Dec. 16, 1973] ABORTION Is BmTH CONTROL Abortion 1s the world's most widespread method of birth control. Nearly one preg(cid:173)nancy in three is deliberately terminated. More than half the money spent on birth control goes for abortions. Only one-third of the world's population has enough knowl(cid:173)edge of contraception to regulate family growth. These are some of the more startling revelations recently reported by Dr. J. Cor(cid:173)bett McDonald a.t a conference of the In(cid:173)ternational Planned Parenthood Associa(cid:173)tion. A survey that covers 209 countries shows that less than one fertile couple in three throughout the world practices a.ny birth control, thereby placing 500 million women 1n danger of unwanted pregnancies. The major need, according to Dr. Mc(cid:173)Donald, 1s to create a socla.l, cultural, and educational climate throughout the world 1n which contraception is acceptable. This 1s particularly necessary in developing coun(cid:173)tries where the death rate is going down and the birth rate going up. --;J the Washington Star-News, Nov. 4, 1973] WOltltiED ABOUT POPULATION GROWTH RATE (By Abigail Van Buren) Dear Abby: Someone signed \"father of six daughters\" wanted to know 1f there was a foolproof way for him to get a son, and you replied, \"Yes.

            "704": "704 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE January 24, 1974 From then on, Dr. Fern6s sought and ob\u00b7 tained approval of law 600, by which the Congress acknowledges the right of the Puer(cid:173)to Rican people to organize their govern(cid:173)ment on the basis of their own constitution. Dr. Fern6s presided the Constitutional Convention which dellberated during 50 days to draft and approve the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, a polltical instrument which once ratified by popular vote was approved by the Congress on time to be proclaimed as the supreme law of the land on July 25, 1952. Dr. Fern6s' partici(cid:173)pation was efficient, opportune, almost deci(cid:173)sive, in all the related admlnlstrative and polltical proceedings. After voluntarily stepping out as Resident Commissioner in 1964, Dr. Fern6s was elected a Senator in the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly; and when his term expired in 1968 he decided to retire from active polltics. Dr. Fern6s was an aristocrat of both writ(cid:173)ten and verbal expression, and the clarity of his reasoning ran parallel to the pulchri(cid:173)tude of his personal manners. He was a gentleman and a diplomat in the true sense of these concepts. His achievements made him one of our authentic leaders during the last half century of our history. Puerto Rico 1s indebted to Antonio Fern6s-Isern. EDITORIAL IN THE ENGLISH NEWSPAPER THE SAN JUAN STAR 1n Dr. Antonio Fern6s Isern, who died late Saturday night at the age of 78, helped write the Puerto Rican history of the 1940s and 1950s that changed Puerto Rico from an agrarian society struggling for survival into one of the foremost developing societies in the world. A physician who left his profession to labor within the ranks of the bloonting Popular Democratic Party he was for long years ( 1946-64) Puerto Rico's Resident Commis(cid:173)sioner in Washington and, as such, Luis Munoz Marin's right arms in spreading un(cid:173)derstanding of Commonwealth status Washington and in securing federal aid pro(cid:173)grams. His tenure 1n Washington :was marked by many accomplishments and few failures. Among the latter was the so-called Fern6s(cid:173)Murray Blll, which died in Congress in 1960. This blll called for a series of changes 1n U.S.-Puerto Rican relations designed to give the island more autonomy. Fern6s left the post of Resident Commis(cid:173)sioner in 1964 but that did not end his publlc service. He was elected to the senate that same year and until 1968 he served outstand(cid:173)ingly as an elder statesman 1n that branch of the Legislature. Antonio Fern6s Isern was a charming, knowledgeable man who put his wisdom and diplomacy at Puerto Rico's call for his adult life. All of Puerto Rico owes a debt of grati(cid:173)~ude and an honored place in its memories to Dr. Fern6s. I Mr. JOHNSON of California. Mr. Speaker, it was with much sadness that learned of the recent passing of my friend and former colleague, Dr. An(cid:173)tonio Fern6s-Isern, a former Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico. Together we &erved as members of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Com(cid:173)mittee during the consideration of many significant bills in the early 1960's. I could always count on the counsel of Dr. have missed his presence in these halls, and are sorry to learn that he is no longer with us. Dr. Fern6s was a legend in his own time. It was he who tirelessly worked for the legislation which granted his homeland the status it enjoys today. Fern6s to be valuable and informed. We With many hours of hard work and determined effort, Dr. Fern6s gained the approval of his colleagues for the legis(cid:173)lation creating the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. It was always a pleasure for me to work witl:1 him, for he was a man who enjoyed his work and shared this enthusiasm with others. He was always very much concerned with the legislation before the committee and contributed greatly to its consideration. In nearly 20 years of service in the Congress, Dr. Fern6s made many friends for his native land as well as for himself. We will miss his advice and counsel. Mrs. Johnson joins me in expressing our deep sympathy to his family and friends. Mr. WON PAT. Mr. Speaker, it was with great sadness that I recently Iea.med of the death of a former Member of this body and a personal friend, Dr. Antonio Fem6s-Isern, who passed away in Puerto Rico on Saturday, January 19. Dr. Fem6s left behind him a remark(cid:173)able legacy of pub1ic service and compas(cid:173)sion for his fellow Puerto Ricans. A phy(cid:173)sician who left his profession to work in politics, Dr. Fern6s served as Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner in Wash(cid:173)ington from 1946 to 1964 with outstand(cid:173)ing distinction. As the San Juan Star noted ip its edi(cid:173)torial marking the passing of this great man: His tenure 1n Washington was marked by many accomplishments and few failures. Among his many accomplishments was, of course, the passage of Public Law 81-600, which authorized the creation of the Commonwealth status between Puerto Rico and the United St.ates. During those days, Guam, too, was working hard to improve its status with(cid:173)in the American system. As a member of the team of Guam officials who came to Washington to work for the passage of an organic act establishing a civll gov(cid:173)ernment and granting U.S. citizenship to the people of Guam, I had the privilege of working closely with Dr. Fern6s. His counsel and astute understanding of the congressional system and his sympathy for our cause contributed in no small way to our ultimate success. Upon his completion of two terms as Resident Commissioner, Dr. Fem6s re(cid:173)turned to the island he so deeply loved and was elected to the Puerto Rico Sen(cid:173)ate in which he served until 1968. All Americans, and especially those of us from the territories, owe a great deal to the efforts of Dr. Fern6s to create a better tmderstanding between his j)eople and their fellow citizens in the States. Understanding mutual problems is the key to successful relations between all peoples, and Dr. Fem6s' significant con(cid:173)tribution to this end paved the way for increased involvement in the American way of life for all territorial Americans. Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker. it was with deep personal regret that I received the news of the death 'of our former col(cid:173)league and friend, the delegate from Puerto Rico, Dr. Antonio Fern6s-Isem. Through the years that we were col(cid:173)leagues in the House, I came to know and respect this very \"gentle\" man who, though a physician by profession, ex(cid:173)celled in many other areas as well. All of us who worked with him were im(cid:173)pressed with his efforts on behalf of the people of Puerto Rico, whom he served for over 50 years. It was he who authored the law creating the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the law ratifying the constitution of that Commonwealth after presiding over the Puerto Rican Constitutional Convention. All of the important legislation affecting Puerto Rico bore his handprint. . I share the sadness the people of Puerto Rico must feel and extend my sympathy to the members of his famlly. GENERAL LEAVE Mr. BENITEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and. extend their remarks on the life of our late colleague, the Honorable Antonio Fern6s-Isem. The SPEAKER._ Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Puerto Rico? There was no objection. to OWNER-OPERATOR TRUCKERS' PROBLEMS (Mr. MILFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute, revise and extend his re(cid:173)marks and include extraneous matter.> Mr. MILFORD. Mr. Speaker, during our yearend break I had meetings with several owner-operator truckers in my district. These people have some very serious problems that deserve the immediate at(cid:173)tention of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. Very typical of the problems of our owner-operator truckers are outlined by this letter from Mrs. Margaret Brown of Fort Worth, Tex. I would like to include her letter in the RECORD : FoRT WOR\"llH, TEx., January 5, 1974. DEAR MR. MILFoRD: Would you please let me know 1f it 1s poSSible for me to speak before the Congress of the U.S. on the plight of the Independent Truckers situation. Six months ago my husband was paying from 21\u00a2 to 32\u00a2 .per gallon. The freight rates have not increased at this time. We are slowly going broke simply because we can(cid:173)not continue to drive our truck. I would like to go to Washington and present the facts to the whole senate 1n person. The Independent Truckers are going be in Washington on the 21st of January and we are going to be heard. One man with one truck cannot make a living any more. Hoping to he!'-r from you. to MARGARET BROWN. ALLIED SERVICES ACT OF 1974 The SPEAKER.

            "754": "754 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 24, 19'7 4 ask how could the report be so signifi(cid:173)cant? First, the Commission developed a -comprehensive analytical framework and accumulated the most CJmplete data base ever assembled on higher educa(cid:173)tion. I am pleased that the Office of Edu(cid:173)cation plans to continue this data base and even more pleased that this in(cid:173)formation will be available to all who are willing to pay for the use of the -computer. Other education study groups have recommended specific financing pro(cid:173)grams for secondary education. We felt, however, that it was more significant that we construct an analytical frame(cid:173)work that will enable decisionmakers and the education community at the local, State and Federal levels to ana(cid:173)lyze the advantages and disadvantages of the various financial proposals that have been advanced, and will be ad(cid:173)vanced in the future. It should be made clear, however, that the Commissioners do not consider the analytical framework developed as the final answer. Yet, considering the primi(cid:173)tive state-of-the-art and the dearth of information and data available, the Commission has taken a giant step. We call on the academic community and others to continue to sharpen this tool and to move toward the degree of so(cid:173)phistication that is needed. Incidentally, these are the very tools which the academic community right(cid:173)fully prides itself in using. Yet, I be(cid:173)lieve that they have employed these same tools inadequately in the past in looking at the postsecondary education enterprise. It should be noted that the Commis(cid:173)sion's report extended beyond the tradi(cid:173)tional concept of higher education, which includes approximately 3,000 in(cid:173)stitutions and 9.3 million students, and also embraced what we refer to as the noncollegiate sector which encompasses over 7,000 institutions and 1.6 million students. These are basically vocational and proprietary institutions which play a critical role in educating and equip(cid:173)ping citizens with needed skills to meet the manpower needs of our country. There are today and there will remain, many good jobs which do not require a college education and I believe that the Commission's broadened definition will help to acquaint the Nation on the vari(cid:173)ety of opportunities that exist in the postsecondary enterprise. The Commission did respond directly to two of the specific mandates of the 1972legislation; namely, an examination into the important issue of financial dis(cid:173)tress among institutions of higher educa(cid:173)tion and secondly, the development of standards procedures for determining the annual percentage cost of postsec(cid:173)ondary education. With respect to the financial distress question, we found there was not finan(cid:173)cial distress that substantially jeopardize national objectives although we did find that there are some individual institu(cid:173)tions in serious financial difficulty. The .report also raises some warning flags indicating that other institutions may face distress in view of some of the trends which we see, such as enrollment de(cid:173)creases, and the problems associated with institutions offering discount prices to lower-income students. Regarding the national standards for institutional costing, we found that they were fP.asible and desirable, althought we did raise some important caveats. While there are some problems, I am convinced that the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages. I am also convinced that the recommendations of the Commission for the use of interim national standards by a number of institutions on a volun(cid:173)tary basis\u00b7, with Federal support for the additional cost involved, makes sense and will help us to avoid some of the \"bugs\" and work out some of the problems asso(cid:173)ciated with the application of uniform standards to such institutions as the community colleges and the research universities. I am hopeful that the higher education community, which has been somewhat uneasy about this provision, will not view these national standards with fear. Rather, I urge them to embrace the con(cid:173)cept and work to see that comparable and useful data be developed and col(cid:173)lected. I am convinced that this wlll be a useful management tool for the insti(cid:173)tutions and also invaluable for policy(cid:173)makers and funders. Finally, at a time when we hear so much that is bad and not working, I be(cid:173)lieve that we should take pride in the fact that the Commission found that cur(cid:173)rent financial aid programs have im(cid:173)proved access in the past several years. Specifically, we found as result of financial aid programs, 1.4 million stu(cid:173)dents, who otherwise would not have at(cid:173)tended, are doing so. We produced evi(cid:173)dence showing improved participation rates with students from families be(cid:173)low $3,000 and with students families in the income range of $3,000 to $6,000. We found that their percentage of total post(cid:173)secondary education enrollment closely approximated the percentage of their total age bracket. Nevertheless, we also found that the participation rate for 18 to 24 year olds whose family income was $10,000 or more, is twice the rate of those with family income of less than $10,000. Particularly disturbing was the partic(cid:173)ipation rate of the group with family incomes between $6,000 and $7,500. It may be that this group is just above the income category for financial assistance. We should be exploring the reason for the fact that although having 16.7 per(cid:173)cent of the 18 to 24 age group, their per(cid:173)centage distribution in college enroll(cid:173)ment is only 6.9 percent. Mr. President, I want to make it clear that the Commission members do not regard the report released today as rep(cid:173)resenting an end, but rather it represents a beginning. The real value of the Commission's work will depend on the extent to which others--the postsecondary education community, State legislatures, Congress, and the administration pick up the \"ball.\" I am hopeful, for example, that the Congress and State legislatures throughout the country will continue the momentum that has been gained by the work of the Commission. I was encour(cid:173)aged to hear today that Congressman O'Hara, chairman of the Special Educa(cid:173)tion Subcommittee of the House Educa(cid:173)tion and Labor Committee, contemplates holding hearings on the Commission's report in the near future. I urge the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Sub(cid:173)committee on Education do likewise. Mr. President, as a result of the 14-month study, I am impressed with the strength and diversity of postsec(cid:173)ondary education. It is a $30 billion en(cid:173)terprise and it is of utmost importance to all of our citizens and to the Nation. Because of the importance of the Com(cid:173)mission's report and of the interest in it, I ask unanimous consent that a sum(cid:173)mary of its recommendations be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Postsecondary education, like the entire American society, has changed significantly during the past twenty years. To respond to this change, the first tasks of those charged with the financing of postsecondary educa(cid:173)tion are to put aside outdated perceptions, look anew at the objectives of postsecondary education, and examine the methods by which those objectives may be accomplished. Those who propose changes in financing must be able to offer reasonable assurances that what they propose wlll produce the intended results. For this reason, the Commission and its staff have placed the highest priority on as(cid:173)sembling pertinent data and using them to analyze alternative policy proposals in a sys(cid:173)tematic way. Thus, while the Commission believes its recommendations to be impor(cid:173)tant, so too are the substantive findings on which they are based and on which others may base their own recommendations. There(cid:173)fore, this chapter includes not only the Com(cid:173)mission's recommendations, but also those of its conclusions that it believes to be im(cid:173)portant considerations for the resolution of policy issues in the future. POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION SOCIETY IN A CHANGING Conclusions 1. Postsecondary education in the United States is a large enterprise including more than 2,900 traditional collegiate institutions serving some 9.3 mlllion students and an ad(cid:173)ditional 7,000 noncollegiate technical, voca(cid:173)tional, and proprietary institutions serving approximately 1.6 million students. Postsec(cid:173)ondary education also includes an estimated 3,500 additional institutions and organiza(cid:173)tions (serving an unknown number of stu(cid:173)dents) as well as a great many other non(cid:173)institutional learning opportunities (in which as many as 32 million people may par(cid:173)ticipate). 2. Recognlzlng the broad scope of postsec(cid:173)ondary education, the Commission has adopted for the purposes of its study the following definition, encompaslng the 2,900 traditional collegiate institutions and 7,000 noncollegiate lnstl tutions: Postsecondary education consists of formal instruction, research, public service, and other learning opportunities offered by edu(cid:173)cational institutions that primarily serve persons who have completed secondary edu(cid:173)\u00b7catlon or who are beyond the compulsory school attendance age and that are accredited by agencies omclally recognized for that pur(cid:173)pose by the u.s. omce of Education or are ",

DEAR HENRY: I would like to take this op(cid:173)portunity to congratulate you on your ap(cid:173)pointment to become Secretary of State. This is certainly a reflection on your outstanding diplomatic achievements of the past four and a half years, and I have every confi(cid:173)dence that the Senate wlll swiftly confirm your appointment. I hope that one of your initial concerns as Secretary of State will be the men who are sttll missing 1n action in Southeast Asia. Hanoi has yet to live up to Article 8B of the cease-fire agreement and, as a result, the families of those missing in action exist ln limbo. They do not know whether the men are dead or alive. No American search teams have been allowed to go into Communist held territory. It is inhumane to allow this situation to exist. The peace treaty is empty for those famllies of men missing 1n action. I believe that it should be the highest diplomatic pri(cid:173)ority of this country to effect a complete ac(cid:173)counting of all those who have served in Southeast Asia. It is my firm hope that as Secretary of State you will pledge to make this commitment to the famllies of those men missing 1n action. Again, congratulations on your appoint(cid:173)ment.

Speciflcally, this is the issue of Amercan servicemen who are missing in action in Southeast Asia and who are not accounted for by your country. Your government has not abided by Article \u00b7sB of the cease-fire agreement, and has not allowed any American search teams to go into territory which you possess. This 1s an inhumane situation, and one which could be easily alleviated by your government. Surely your government has nothing to gain by . continuing to prolong the agony and heart(cid:173)break of the families involved. I can personally assure you that the United states Congress is deeply concerned about this situation and that much of its future actions concerniJ.ng your country will be guided by what you do concernng these miss(cid:173)Jng servicemen.

EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS INTERLOCKING DffiECTORSHIPS HON. LES ASPIN OP WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 24, 1974 19 Mr. ASPIN. Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of speculation lately as to why the on companies behave in such a mo(cid:173)nopolistic manner. I believe that a large part of the answer lies in the fact that a number of interlocking directorships exist among the oil and gas firms. These interlocking directorates have the effect of eliminating competition since com(cid:173)mon directors tend to monopolize a mar(cid:173)ket and provide the opportunity for ex(cid:173)change of information. I have asked Attorney General Saxbe to investigate the apparent violation of the Clayton Act, which bans interlocking directorates in competing companies, by individuals. The various Attorney Generals who have served in the current administration have avoided offering a precise definition of what constitutes an interlocking directorate. We have all become very concerned about the energy shortage and how it has come about. I would like to suggest that this problem, like so many others, is a result of the activities 9f individuals. For far too long the oilmen in this coun(cid:173)try have been allowed a free hand. They have created an international cartel be(cid:173)yond the reach of most governments. If there is to be any good to come out of our present uncomfortable circum(cid:173)stances, it is that we should never again allow the control of our resources to be vested in the hands of a few men.

A BilL AUTHORIZING PARTITION OF JOINTLY HELD HOPI AND NAVAJO TRIBAL LANDS HON. WAYNE OWENS OF UTAH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 24, 1974 Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, in Septem(cid:173)ber of last year I introduced a bill in(cid:173)tended as a compromise solution to the tragic and costly land dispute between the Hopi and Navajo Indian Tribes in northeastern Arizona. At the same time, an identical bill was introduced in the Senate jointly by the two Senators from Arizona, Mr. FANNIN and Mr. GoLDWATER. The purpose of this proposed legisla(cid:173)tion is to resolve a dispute which began more than a century ago, and in recent times has resulted in bitter and some(cid:173)times violent intertribal con:fiict and has allowed tribal lands to become desolate and unproductive. Prior efforts by the Federal Govern(cid:173)ment and courts to resolve this dispute have been unsuccessful because Congress has never granted authority to the courts to define the territorial boundaries of the two tribes in a partition proceeding. En(cid:173)abling legislation must be passed by Con(cid:173)gress in order to bring about a lasting settlement. It is a matter of history that President Chester A. Arthur in 1882 directed that 2.500,000 acres of public domain land be set aside for the use and occupancy o! the Hopi, and for such other Indians as the Secretary of the Interior may see fit to settle thereon. Over the years many Navajos have moved from their adjoining reservation onto the original Hopi lands, \u2022 Not listed in SEC report--information obtained from SEC and ms omcials. ",
            "854": "854 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE January 28, 1974 dllution 1n yield occasloned by dlscot:nt-fare tramc . \u2022. \u2022 (71-4-54, p. 38) There are two ways of \"adjusting\" the load factor standard to take account of dilution: one is to adjust that standard it(cid:173)self; the other is to employ a separate stand(cid:173)ard limiting dilution to a reasonable level. Petitioners have proposed the latter approach 1n this case, urging that a guideline dilution standard of 12 percent be used and that dilution in excess of that amount not be rec(cid:173)ognized. (Tr. 661, 739) In Order 72-12-18, dated December 5, 1972,85 the Board went further than this. It determined that henceforth it would com(cid:173)pute fares \"on a hypothetical full normal(cid:173)fare ba.sis te., as 1f the discount fares were not a part of the fare structure.\" (p. 4) In other words, normal fares would not be in(cid:173)creased at all to make up the dt.trerence be(cid:173)tween revenue produced at a reasonable run(cid:173)fare load factor and revenue actually earn(cid:173)ed. Since the carriers experienced dilution after October 1, 1969 was substantially high(cid:173)er than 12 percent, application of the Board's approach in this case would produce a sub(cid:173)stantially greater disallowance of revenue need, and thus a substant1ally greater dis(cid:173)crepancy with reported revenues, than peti(cid:173)tioners have urged. The agency has been concerned with the problem of dilution for essentially the same reasons as those advanced by petitioners: [I]n the long run the carries add equip(cid:173)ment and schedules in order to accommo(cid:173)date discount traffic. When this occurs, the discount fares cease to cover costs and the shortfall must either be subsidized by the normal-fare passenger, or the carriers will not realize sufficient revenues to provide ade(cid:173)quate service. (72-12-18, p. 12) The Board explained that over the period from 1966 through 1971, the carriers were purchasing equipment and scheduling with reference to all traffic, including discount(cid:173)fare traffic, and \"were increasing their ca(cid:173)pacity at a faster rate than the growth of traffic warranted, notwithstanding the high level of discount traffic.\" (72-12-18, p. 43) Of course, a raising of normal fares in order to cover the declining yield produced by such discount traffic burdens the normal-fare pas(cid:173)senger by asking him \"to bear a fare increase in order to cover the short-fall created by the discount fares.\" (72-12-18, p. 46) The Board noted that \"under previous policies, the carriers have not had adequate incentives to consider the long-term impact of promotional fares since ratemaking prac(cid:173)tice has permitted them to seek fare-level increases to offset declines in yield stemming from the discount fares.\" (72-12-18, p. 56) A policy of adjusting cost projections and revenue need \"to eliminate the dilution caused by the discount fares\" (72-12-18, p. 55) is, therefore, \"a necessary adjunct to the load-factor standards established in [Order 71-4-54] \": The purpose of the load-factor standard was to assure that the fare level would not be burdened by the cost of providing service in excess of the needs of the traveling public. It was and remains the Board's intention that the 55-percent standard be achieved through adjustment of aircraft fleet size and schedules in relation to traffic demands. This intention would obviously be frustrated 1t the carriers sought to realize the standard load factor by an artificial stimulation of tramc through the use of discount fares and were free to pass the losses from such traffic on to the remainder of the traveling public. Such a result would clearly be at war with our statutory goal of assuring that air trans(cid:173)portation be furnished at the lowest cost consistent with the performance of adequate and eftlcient service. Indeed, faHure to adopt an undUuted normal-fare concept in fiXing Footnotes at end of article. passenger-fare levels could well create a pow(cid:173)erful incentive for the carriers, leading to undesirable extensions and proliferations of discounts as a means of achieving the stand(cid:173)ard load factors. (72-12-18, pp. 57-58; cita(cid:173)tion omitted) The Board accordingly determined that it would not accept any dllution in determining the full fare; discount and promotional fares would be accepted only on a short-term basis and only for the legitimate purpose of filling otherwise empty seats. In these circumstances, the Board's atti(cid:173)tude toward dUution in order 73-7-39 is, again, puzzling. The agency has observed that discount passengers accounted for more than 40 percent of traffic during the period here under investigation (72-12-18, p. 10); that the percentage of discount traffic has tended to rise as load factors have dropped (72-12-18, p. 43); that the carriers have pro(cid:173)vided substantial excess capacity for the pur(cid:173)pose of carrying discount traffic. (72-12-18, pp. 4o-42) It is therefore odd that the Board finds no \"evidentiary basis\" for a dilution adjustment in this case and finds the appli(cid:173)cation of petitioners' proposed 12 percent standard \"faulty in concept.\" (73-7-39, p. 21, App.-) The reasons for employing a dilution ad(cid:173)justment here are precisely the same as those enunciated by the Board in Order 72-12-18: to take account, after the load factor adjust(cid:173)ment, of that amount of excess capacity which was provided for discount-fare pas(cid:173)sengers. (Tr. 739; see also Tr. 641. 654, 661, 720, 722-25, 730, 783-34) The 12 percent standard. proposed by petitioners was sug(cid:173)gested on the basis of Exhibit BC-6008 sub(cid:173)mitted by the Board's Bureau of Economics in Phase 9 of the DPFI. (Tr. 741-42) Peti(cid:173)tioners' witness, Mr. Klabzuba, had noted, both from that exhibit and from evidence in the record of this case,116 that higher dilu(cid:173)tion figures tended to occur in the longer(cid:173)haul markets, where load factors tended to be especially low. (Tr. 651-54, 720, 739) Mr. Klabzuba. concluded that diluted fares were not serving their purpose of filling otherwise empty seats in those markets and that, in(cid:173)deed, the carriers were obviously adding ca(cid:173)pacity to carry dUuted-fare traffic. He made a judgment that dilution up to 12 percent was tolerable, because load factors in markets where such dilution was experienced were generally not delinquent, but that dilution in excess of 12 percent represented a con(cid:173)tribution to the overcapacity problem and therefore an unreasonable burden on fares. (Tr. 641-654, 739-40) Had the carriers not provided excess capacity to transport diluted(cid:173)fare traffic, the fares that prevailed after October 1, 1969 could have been lower. 727)1'2' Instead of coming to terms with the prob(cid:173)lem of dilution in this case, the Board has limited itself to quibbling with petitioners' proposed standard-a standard significantly more generous to the carriers than the Board's own dilution policy-\u00b7and excused the carriers on the ground that DPFI policies should not be applied \"retroactively.\" The Board argues that the Phase 9 exhibit cited by Mr. Klabzuba does not precisely support his thesis that 12 percent constitutes .. a reasonable line of demarcation between ben(cid:173)eficial dilution and burdensome dilution.\" (73-7-39, p. 22, App. -; Tr. 651-53) In the first place, the exhibit cited by Mr. Klabzuba does support the point that dilution tends to rise as length of haul increases, refiecting an inverse relationship to load factors.ss In the second place, there was a.mple evi(cid:173)dence in the record of this case to support Mr. Klabzuba's thesis. \u2022 Finally, and most importantly, since dilution is a problem which the Board itself has emphatically rec(cid:173)ognized, it could not limlt its inquiries in this area to the simple conclusion that peti(cid:173)tioners' proposed 12 percent standard re(cid:173)flected an \"unsupported judgment.'' (73-7-(Tr. 39, p. 23, App. -)40 The Board has fatled to inquire into an area of ratemaking which petitioners specifically placed in issue an4 which the Board itself has perceived as criti(cid:173)cal. Taxing petitioners with falling to supply an \"evidentiary basis\" for their position (73-7-39, p. 22, App. -) is as much beside the point as noting that they did not make \"studies\" {Tr. 645), or that their witness never held a management position with an airline. (Tr. 700) a. The Board has given three other reasons for its lack of concern about dilution in this case: (a) \"the fact that some passengers may have paid too much because others paid too little could not support a finding of unjust enrichment to the carriers to make amends or restitution\" (73-7-39, p. 23, App. -); (b) \"it would be plainly inequitable for the Board to refuse retroactively to recognize the dilu(cid:173)tion resulting from the charging of discount fares which had become embedded in the fare structure over a period of many years through the filing of tariffs which the Board had allowed to become effective\" (73-7-39, p. 24, App. -); and (c) Order 69-9-68 \"had the effect of decreasing the actual dilution.'' (73-7-39, p. 24, App. -) But none of these points is persuasive. The issue at hand is not whether the carriers were \"unjustly enriched\" but whether the fares in question were \"just and reasonable.\" And the fact that full-fare passengers were called upon to pay too much in order to subs1d1ze diluted-yield passengers is very much a part of that issue. Moreover, the contention that \"some passengers may have paid too much because others paid too little\" is overly sim(cid:173)plistic. The ratema.king problem under dis(cid:173)cussion here is not that discount fares were too low in some absolute sense, but that the carriers added excess capacity in order to carry diluted-yield traffic at a reduced profit margin. This invariably results in higher costs, lower returns, and, under the Board's cost-plus approach to ratemaking, fare in(cid:173)creases. If capacity had been controlled by means of appropriate standards, fares could have been lower throughout the system. And if reasonable load factor and dilution adjust(cid:173)ments are made now, it may well appear that discount-fare passengers did not in fact pay \"too little\" during the period in question. The problem, in other words, is not merely one of discrimination, but one of excess as well. The Board recognized as much in Order 72-12-18. The short answer to the Board's conten(cid:173)tion with respect to \"retroactivity\" is, again, that the statutory provisions allowing for judicial review place the carriers on notice that fare increases may ultimately be found unreasonable. There is no \"inequity\" in such a finding. Finally, it is irrelevant whether or not the October 1969 fares may have reflected some minor improvements on those that prevailed previously. The fares in question here are the responsiblllty of the Board and carriers. They assert that these fares can be recon(cid:173)ciled with the statutory provisions governing \"justness and reasonableness.\" Whether the previous fares were a \"hodgepodge\" or not (I.D., p. 34, App. -), they cannot legitimize subsequent fares which cannot withstand scrutiny on their own. Moreover, it is espe(cid:173)cially inappropriate to point to earlier fares for justification when the Board and carriers had devised a ratemaking system which e1fect1vely precluded judicial review. The Board has sought to excuse the carri(cid:173)ers on the basis of its poor ratemaklng per(cid:173)formance in the past and the carriers \u2022 poor financial performance under the October 1969 fa.res. This is consistent with neither the. statute nor the Board's duties to the public. For the reasons set forth above, a dilution standard must be employed to delete from revenue need that portion of the carri(cid:173)ers' costs reflecting excess capacity employed to carry diluted-yield tramc; in the absence ",
            "904": "904 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1974 There are, however, and thank God, some encouraging signs on the horizon. The grow(cid:173)ing emphasis on a people-oriented U.S. for(cid:173)eign aid program, for instance. The increas(cid:173)ing confidence in the ability of the private agency not to usurp the fundamental role of governments, to be sure, but, nevertheless, to make a significant contribution toward improving the quality of life in the develop(cid:173)ing world. Then, too, there is a growing reali(cid:173)zation of the necessity of not only boosting global food production to meet immediate de(cid:173)mands, but to replenish depleted reserves-(cid:173)in a word, \"a world food security policy\" as Dr. Boerma, Director General of FAO ex(cid:173)pressed it a few weeks ago in a meeting of the organization in Rome. More and more knowledgeable Americans are coming to the realization that we may have to voluntarily agree on a national food tithe and set aside a specific amount of our national production for supplementing the meagre diet of others. We are increasin6 the acreage before being devoted to the produc(cid:173)tion of grains. We are talking less and less about developing world markets for our foods and more and more about how to transfer the essentials of ou.r own food technology so that others may increase local food produc(cid:173)tion to the end that dependency upon our own capacity will be lessened. In his speech at the recent meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Nairobi, Robert McNamara, the Pres(cid:173)ident of the World Bank, highlighted these same priority needs. He pointed out that the growth taking place in developing countries is not reaching the poor and set a target of increased production on small farms. He said, \"There is no viable alternative to increasing the productivity of small scale agriculture 1f any significant advance is to be made in solving the problems of absolute poverty in the rural areas.\" To that I say Amen. With the rural populations of most devel(cid:173)oping countries running as high as 80 or 90 percent of the total population, an empha(cid:173)sis on increased productivity by small farm(cid:173)ers will improve the conditions of a majority of the populations of Third World countries and will constitute an important attack on the world food shortage. In our deliberations over the next two days, we will have the opportunity to review the dimensions of the problem of world food supply and to study America's role in food production and distribution. The part the relative nutritive value of foods will play in meeting world food needs, for instance. The problems of population growth and of the allocation of adequate energy to insure maxi(cid:173)mum food production in this all-too-sud(cid:173)deniy energy-shortage conscious world. We are going to study the amount of land presently being utilized for food production at home and overseas, and perhaps those ad(cid:173)ditional resources which can, 1f necessary, be devoted to this purpose, as well. We will be looking at the signal importance of water to food production. Perhaps we may even look into the possibility of a renewed attempt to develop an economical method of desali(cid:173)nating water so that this huge resource of the seas can be utilized in this way. Experts will be treating the international aspects of a food policy for America, its economic im(cid:173)plications and those competitive interests which will most certainiy atfect it. In short, we will be looking at the problem of feeding ourselves and as many as possible of the hungry of the world (and encouraging others to do likewise) in all its implications, including the political, the social, the eco(cid:173)nom.lc and cultural. In this process, we wlll need to take a good look at our own national priorities and we wm have to urge similar priorities upon others. Food and all its aspects is so funda(cid:173)mental to human survival that, in essence, we will, in attempting to formulate a na(cid:173)tional food policy, be exa.mlning our national conscience at the same time. We will need, of course, to relate our proposed food policy to a global food pollcy, for no one or several nations have the right to control the world's food supply without recognizing and dis(cid:173)charging their responsibility for its prudent use for the benefit of all mankind. And, ladles and gentlemen, may I ask you with all sincerity at my command, to remem(cid:173)ber above all throughout the discussions at this conference, that behind every statistic and fact which mav be related or developed in the next two days, there is the spectre of massive human starvation; that what we ultimately propose and what we urge upon our leaders and fellow citizens as well as the world community, can actually and literally save countless lives, to say nothing of adding immeasurably to the peace and stability of the world. wm this conference lend truth to the words of this verse which appeared way back in 1966 in Punch, the provocative British publication? In countless back alleys, No cradle or bed, A million sweet children Cry out to be fed. Rich nations, as distant As stars in the sky, Look down on their hunger And heave a sad sigh. \"We'll send you our If any,\" they say, \"But we, too, are starving On three meals a day.\" Or will these meetings result in the issu(cid:173)ance of a call to all Americans to support a policy based upon the responsible and com(cid:173)passionate sharing with others of the fruits of America's agricultural prowess? \"America. America. God shed his grace on thee.\" America. America. Appreciative of His gifts, reasoned, responsible, just and compassion(cid:173)ate let the thoughts and actions of this conference on national food poUcy be. leavings, RAIL PASSENGER TRANSPORTATION Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I would like to call to the attention of my col(cid:173)leagues an editorial appearing in the Washington Post last Thursday, Janu(cid:173)ary 24, highlighting the need for more and better rail transportation service. Since the energy crisis began, Amtrak has been deluged with an overabundance of passengers and requests. Not only has Amtrak been unable to provide seats for all the potential passengers on estab(cid:173)lished routes, but Amtrak has also been unable to provide any service at all to areas in great need of rail service. Foremost among these areas are rec(cid:173)reation communities that are not within easy automobile commuting distance of a large metropolitan area. Large portions of our country are heavily dependent on recreation and tourism for their eco(cid:173)nomic survival. Rail passenger service is essential for many of these areas if they are to withstand the effects of the imme(cid:173)diate fuel shortages. But I would not be speaking out for long-term commitments to rail service if I believed the effects of the fuel shortage are short term only. Even if we can de(cid:173)velop self-sufficiency in energy within a decade it will be necessary for us to make some major changes in our lifestyle and habits. One of the easiest methods for change is to employ mass transportation for travel recreation areas, areas to to, where in the past we would drive leave our car in the parking lot for the duration of our stay, and then drive home. Our Nation presently has one of the least developed systems of rail passenger service in the Western World. It is high time we began to correct this deficiency with a major Federal commitment to such service. I ask unanimous consent that the edi(cid:173)torial referred to be printed in its entirety in the RECORD. There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Washington Post, Jan. 24, 1974) RAILROADS AND PASSENGERS Last fall, Amtrak, which is supposed to entice people back to the pleasures of rail(cid:173)road travel, began to set up a computerized, national telephone reservation system of the kind the airlines have used for years. The system's capacity seemed sufficient for five years. Then, on November 19, the President proclaimed the energy crisis, gasoline and jet fuel supplies seemed threatened, people took to the ralls, and, what with the Christ(cid:173)mas holidays, the new reservation system was jammed by the sudden, overwhelming de(cid:173)mand for seats. As a result, it still can be somewhat annoying to reserve an Amtrak railroad ticket. And that pretty wellillustra.tes our passen(cid:173)ger train dilemma. Amtrak, with the help of airline and travel agency experts, seems to have done a good, slow, difllcult but con(cid:173)scientious job of keeping ran travel from going the way of the stage coach. From 1945 until Amtrak was Ia.unched in May 1971, the railroads ha.d steadily lost 15 per cent of their passengers every year. Now they are regain(cid:173)ing 11 per cent every year. This is due to a number of visible improvements. Amtrak, first of all, consolidated the pas(cid:173)senger runs across the country to a bare minimum. Some cities, such as Cleveland, are not served by passenger trains at all. Next Amtrak began to improve the cars. Oniy half of the existing 3,000 cars were considered sal(cid:173)vageable. The other half are being refur(cid:173)bished at the ra.te of first 48 and lately 70 cars a month. New diesel locomotives have been put in service or ordered. The Chicago(cid:173)St. Louis run has a whole new train, made in France. Personnel has been retrained. There is now a nationwide timetable. Many cities have downtown ticket offices and some have had their railroad stations cleaned and repainted. Three new stations--at Jacksonville, Fla., Springfield, Mass., and Cincinnati, Ohio-(cid:173)have been built. There has even been some modest innovation. Some of the long distance trains have passenger representatives to help make people comfortable and some, like the Montrealer, include recreation cars that offer games and movies and have a piano player along for entertainment. The Interstate Commerce Commission, fur(cid:173)thermore, is about to issue new customer service standards for passenger railroads that will insist on proper luggage handling, a !air reservation system and punctual perform(cid:173)ance. Under the new rulings, railroads can be fined tor being late. But like the new reservation system, all these gains are likely to be overwhelmed by the new demand on railroad travel created by the energy crisis. There is not enough eqUlp(cid:173)m.ent to handle a. sudden increase in pas(cid:173)sengers. It will take years to build addi(cid:173)tional cars and locomotives, particularly since Amtrak rightly insists on new, up-to(cid:173)date des1~ and engineering rather t-han re(cid:173)ordering obsolete models. The refurbishing program can, of course, be accelerated. But there is ~ yet little incentive and less money to get the railroads ready for the new pas-",

And just about the time he arrives there the world will swing into the tail of a poisonous comet and wipe out the whole tragic farce in one fell swoop. Man is the victim of a malign destiny. It isn't his show. It's God's, whoever he is.\" Another firm composed of fighters who have won their stripes in a series of legal battles, albeit not as long a series as Vincent Hallinan's, is that of Garry, Dreyfus, McTer(cid:173)nan & Brotsky. Because of his role as chief defense counsel of the Black Panther party, Garry will be discussed in section III. Benjamin Dreyfus, born in 1910, is a na(cid:173)tive of San Francisco. He went to Stanford University, then tried to make his living in busine~ for four years before deciding to become a lawyer. He then attended Stan(cid:173)ford Law School, and, because of the politics of that time-the 1934 Upton Sinclair cam(cid:173)paign and the workings of the National La(cid:173)bor Relations Board (NLRB)-decided to be a lawyer for the oppressed. \"I began practicing here in 1939, joined the Guild as soon as I was admitted to practice, and started working as a lawyer for people who were getting kicked around.\" He continued practicing on his own until he formed a partnership with Frank McTer(cid:173)nan in 1945. Around that time he also served as executive secretary of the San Francisco Guild chapter. From 1960 until1962 he served as president of the Guild. The man he originally joined in partner4 ship, Francis McTernan, was an Amherst College and Columbia Law School graduate who had begun his legal career as an attor(cid:173)ney for the NLRB in Washington. Almost immediately after he joined that organiza(cid:173)tion he was sent to California to investigate charges that the Associated Farmers were engaging in unfair labor practices against workers who were trying to organize. He found that they were but could not prove it. When a budget drive spearheaded by the Chamber of Commerce resulted in his being let go from the NLRB, McTernan came to San Francisco and worked with a commercial law firm for a year and a half before going into the navy. After the war he joined with Dreyfus in partnership, then, in 1948, ran for Congress on the Independent Progressive party ticket. He withdrew at the end of the campaign to throw his support to the liberal Democrat who was running. McTernan served as presi(cid:173)dent of the San Francisco Gulld chapter from 1958 through 1960. In 1957 McTernan and Dreyfus joined with two lawyers they had known through the Guild, Charles Garry and his partner, Julius Keller, to form the nucleus of the present nine-man firm. Shortly after the firm began, Julius Keller died. Allan Brotsky, one of the newer members of the firm, although he is an old-time friend of its nuclear members, was born in De(cid:173)troit and raised there and in Denver. He went for a year to the University of Colo(cid:173)rado, then flnlshed college at UCLA. \"At the University of Colorado I was ex(cid:173)posed to socialism for the first time and it blew my mind. It was almost a revelation to find out that that kind of an alternative existed. Then in Los Angeles I was involved in political activity and in the struggle to organize migratory workers, and it was at that point that I decided to be a lawyer for the people. I went to Columbia. Law and or(cid:173)ganized a group there that became a Guild chapter. After graduating I spent six months in a labor law firm that mainly represented the CIO unions in the New York area.. When the \u00b7war came, I went into the army as a signal corpsman. \"After that, I worked for the United Elec(cid:173)trical Workers in New York for a while, then came out here and joined the leading CIO labor law firm where I remained for seven years. Almost as soon as I joined that firm, the CIO expelled the left unions and the witch hunt began. We took on the legal battles of the expelled unions and grand jury attacks on the radical movement and at(cid:173)tempts to tie people in with espionage rings. \"In 1955 a number of us left that firm to start our own firm, doing the same kinds of things plus immigration cases of people the government was trying to deport on the basis of the McCarran Act. We were also in(cid:173)volved in the cases of doctors and dentists who were being drafted into the army as privates because of faceless informers mak(cid:173)ing charges against them or their friends or relatives. The movement then was at its low(cid:173)est ebb. I continued my Guild membership but the Guild was very quiet. There were discussions about whether it was worthwhile to have it continue after the attorney gen(cid:173)eral proposed to place it on his subversive list with no notice or hearing. The Guild brought a lawsuit in D.C. and, after many years of stalling, the attorney general ad(cid:173)mitted he was wrong and dropped his ef(cid:173)forts to declare the Guild subversive. \"But the damage had been done. The Guild was fighting for its life. A lot of people had been scared and resigned. It took a while before the Guild got back on its feet. \"After a few years with that firm I went on my own doing labor, civil rights, and de(cid:173)fense criminal work. In 1967, ten years after this firm had b~en organized, I joined it. This firm has supported itself by general practice, mainly personal injury work which is the most lucrative, but in the last three and a half years I think we have done more movement work than any other office in the country. When we started doing so much movement work, especially when we took on the Panther work, we were lucky because we had good roots in the community from be(cid:173)fore, so people would still come to us. If that hadn't happened, I don't think the firm would have survived. \"Aside from those of us with our names in the firm name, there are five other law(cid:173)yers in the office-James Herndon, Donald L. A. Kerson, Robert S. Marder, David E. Pesonen, and William F. Schuler-and seven other workers. We have a team here where everybody does whatever they are best quali(cid:173)fied to do. None of our staff feel that they are oppressed. The idea of a lawyer answering the phones, et cetera, doesn't make sense to any of us. The lawyers have their level of income and, in the years when we reach that, we share the profits beyond that. That doesn't happen too often because we usual(cid:173)ly have financial problems although, so far, we have managed to survive.\" Their case load, like the Center for Con(cid:173)stitutional Rights, reads like a Who's Who movement cases, although with more of a West Coast and more of a Black Panther party orientation. They've been involved in Bobby Seale's trials, Huey Newton's trials, David Hilliard's trials, the Lois Siete case, the Oakland Seven, the Angela Davis case, other shootout cases, and the whole gamut of draft cases. \"I wouldn't say,\" said Brotsky, \"that our views on the Panthers are uniform, but the thing that unites us is the belief that the Panthers are an important part of the move(cid:173)ment, particularly the movement for Black liberation. Charles is personally more in(cid:173)volved because, except for Lois Siete and Oakland Seven, he's been doing nothing but Panther work !or the past !our years. But we're all deeply committed by conviction. Charlie has been made a star by the press and \"\"he movement rank and file by the pub(cid:173)licity he has received !rom his Panther work, but he's not a star in the office and he doesp't conceive of himself as such, nor do we. He's just the part of the team that has gotten the most publicity because he has been in court and or the front line so much. in a Wrath was ~To some extent, the courts are being re(cid:173)formed every day. Whether these reforms mean anything, I don't know. I don't think our society, as presently constltutea. can ev~.r have justice for Black people, for or the young or revolutionary movement peo(cid:173)ple because the society is a class society and that can never give justice to all members of the opposing classes who are trying to liberate themselves. \"But I think it is important to struggle for all of the rights and safeguards we now have in the courts so that the right to struggle and organize will be preserved. It's a hell of a lot harder to have a movement in a fascist state than\u00b7it is in a conservative, democratic state. I'm optimistic. I think the people of the world are going to win their battle to make the world a humane, comradely, hu(cid:173)manistic place for all people.\" Garry, Dreyfus, McTernan & Brotsky is not the only San Francisco firm with a Who's Who case load of movement cases, nor with a media star in its midst. The other firm shar(cid:173)ing this dubious honor does, in fact, go the Garry firm two better since one of its two partners and two of its associates are media stars of the radical law movement. The firm is that of Michael Kennedy and Joseph Rhine, and associated with the firm are Dennis Roberts and Michael Tigar. They are housed big red house with a largely red and black interior in which Mike Ken(cid:173)nedy feels very much at home, partly be(cid:173)cause he is an Aries surrounded by Arlen colors, and partly because it was decorated by his wife, Eleanore, who is an interior de(cid:173)signer. Kennedy was born in Spokane and raised there and in Seattle until he was ten when his family moved to Corcoran, California., the San Joaquin Valley town where Grapes of filmed. From there he went to Berkeley, majored in economics, joined a fra(cid:173)ternity, and quit after eighteen months because it had a white clause. He also during this time became friends with the Halli(cid:173)nans, Peter Franck, and Arjay Lenske. After graduating from Berkeley, he went to Ha-st(cid:173)ings Law School in San Francisco. \"Being a lawyer seemed to me to be the slickest capitalistic rip-off and professional position one could get, and it seemed I could placate my conscience, to the extent that I had a conscience, by occasionally doing things with the law that one couldn't do in other professions. I had wanted to be a lawyer for a long time, to make a lot of money, get an elite position, and protect the hell out of tt for the rest of my life. \"But the more I got into the law, the more I realized what a morass it was, that the poor and people of color were treated dif(cid:173)ferently, and that it really hadn't changed that much from feudalistic times in Eng(cid:173)land.\" In law school he first met Joe Rhine, the son of union organizers who were active in the labor movement from the thirties through the fifties. Because of his parents' profession Joe had moved around a lot, at(cid:173)tending high school in Indianapolis, Phila(cid:173)delphia, and Arvada, Colorado, before doing his undergraduate work at the University of Colorado and then going on to Hastings. After meeting Rhine, Kennedy got involved in trying to make the law school employment people hire people from minorities and was washed down the city hall steps on Black Friday. Whlle at Berkeley, Kennedy had re-ceived a ROTC commission, with a defer(cid:173)ment to go to law school so he could go into the judge advocates corps when he finished. \"Because o! my relationship with Joe and other left-wing people the Counter Intelll(cid:173)gence Corps and the FBI started to investi(cid:173)gate me along about my second year o! law school.

Many other nations share with us the desire and the capacity to help close this gap be(cid:173)tween the have and have-not peoples of the world. The facts of in\\ernational life today are that common sense and common survival dictate common action to solve common problems. As societies and their problems have be(cid:173)come more complex, more and more people are educated in international affairs and have become concerned citizens. Mass media reach and stimulate increasing numbers of people. The number of individuals and institutions that influence major decisions in every coun(cid:173)try is growing. This is tr.ue in international as well as in domestic matters. The geometric increase in citizen involve(cid:173)ment in world affairs has special significance tor the diplomat. It is a fundamental, irre\u00b7 versible, and irresistible influence for peace. Nations are less likely to deal with their dif(cid:173)ferences in absolute terms when their clti\u00b7 zens communicate and cooperate with eacb other freely and frequently. When people-to-people bonds and com(cid:173)munications networks are more fully de(cid:173)veloped, there w111 be a great readiness to communicate, to seek accommodation, and to negotiate. The likelihood of international confrontation wlll diminish, and prospects for peaceful solutions will be enhanced. This rationale governs the interest of the State Department in the furtherance of meaningful people-to-people exchange. In the past few years, social scientists have increasingly studied the relevance of informal nongovernmental communications activities to matters of war and peace. Research schol(cid:173)ars such as Dr. Herbert Kelman at Harvard University are attempting to develop a more scientific base for these transnational cross(cid:173)cultural communications activities. Their research suggests that the existence of in(cid:173)formal communications tends to reduce the level of tension when conflicts of interest occur; they contribute to a climate of opinion in which conflicts may be negotiated more effectively. Second, their research indicates that informal relationships create a greater openness in individual attitudes toward other nations, peoples, and cultures; these predis(cid:173)positions also lead to greater readiness to communicate and to resolve differences peaceably. Third, social scientists tell us that international cooperation and exchange con(cid:173)tribute to world-mindedness and to an in(cid:173)ternationalist or global perspective on what otherwise might be viewed either as purely national or essentially allen problems. Fi(cid:173)nally, international people-to-people rela(cid:173)tionships help develop enduring networks of communication which cut across boundaries and reduce the likelihood of polarization along political or nationalist lines. DEPARTMENT-SPONSORED EXCHANGES When you think of the State Department's conduct of our international affairs, the ex\u00b7 change-of-persons program does not come immediately to mind. It is, nonetheless, a sig(cid:173)nificant and important activity of the De(cid:173)partment. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs works constantly and quietly to improve the climate for diplomacy and international cooperation. The exciting, challenging job of the Bureau is to utlllze its modest funds and manpower to reinforce the work of American individuals and orga(cid:173)nizations who want to help construct, a little at a time, the foundation of better relation(cid:173)ships with the rest of the world. It also co(cid:173)ordinates, as necessary, the activities of other government agencies with international ex(cid:173)change programs in substantive fields, such as health, education, social welfare, trans\u00b7 portation, agriculture, miUtary training, and urban planning. Having come not too long ago from the business world, I have a great appreciation for what is being done for an investment of some $45 million annually. There are several major elements of the Department's exchange program: The Fulbright-Hays exchange program over 25 years has engaged more than 100,000 people in academic exchanges. Annually, some 5,400 professors, lecturers, and scholars are exchanged to and from the United States. The international visitor program brings to the United States about 2,000 foreign lead(cid:173)ers and potential leaders annually for one(cid:173)or two-months orientation programs. This includes nonacademic leaders and profes(cid:173)sionals, from Cabinet officers to journalists. One out of every 10 heads of state in the world today has been a State Department exchange visitor, as have some 250 Cabinet ministers of other nations. The Department of State sends abroad an(cid:173)nually several leading performing arts groups and athletic stars; for example, in the past year under this program the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and the New York City Ballet toured the Soviet Union; one of Amer(cid:173)ica's leading popular singing groups, the Fifth Dimension, performed in Eastern Eu(cid:173)rope; Robert Lee Elder and the Morehouse College Glee Club visited Africa; and the United States basketball and swimming teams just returned from tours to the Peo(cid:173)ple's Republic of China. Some 150 prominent U.S. lecturers went abroad for six-week lecture tours in 1972. Nearly 500 United Nations specialists se(cid:173)lected by their home countries and funded by the U.N., are programmed annually by the State Department through 30 other govern(cid:173)ment agencies for six-to nine-month train(cid:173)ing programs in the United States. The commitment to these programs is sub(cid:173)stantial. They are administered, in coopera(cid:173)tion with thousands of volunteers and many private organizations, by Bureau personnel in Washingoon and at our reception centers in Honolulu, Miami, New Orleans, New York, and San Francisco. Abroad they are admin(cid:173)istered, in cooperation with the United States Information Agency, by the cultural affairs officers in our embassies. In 50 countries there are binational commissions which have re(cid:173)suonsibility for supervising the academic exchanl!e program. The State Department's small but catalytic exchange-of-persoru; program with 126 coun(cid:173)tries stimulates constructive communication among leaders and future leaders in many fields here and abroad. It creates durable reservoirs of information, understanding, and empathy. It develops rewarding and lastill~ contacts of key people of other countries with their counterparts here. PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION These programs depend heavlly on the wm(cid:173)ing cooperation of countless private indi(cid:173)viduals and organizations throughout the United States. Their response has been out(cid:173)standing. The Department contracts 'With a number of organizations to assist in carrying out these activities. For instance, COSERV(cid:173)the National Councll for Community Services to International Visitors--is a network of 80 voluntary organizations throughout the United States which enlists some 100,000 Americans to provide hospitality and orien(cid:173)tation for international visitors. They serve volunta.rlly because they believe 1n the im(cid:173)portance of their work to strengthen inter(cid:173)national understanding. This makes an In(cid:173)delible impression on the foreign visitors they serve. You have one of the truly outstanding chapters of the COSERV organization right here in Houston-the Houston Interna.tlonal Service Committee. Another organization, the National Asso(cid:173)ciation for Foreign Student Affairs, counsels many of the 150,000 foreign students now studying in American colleges and universi(cid:173)ties. The Institute of International E<1ucat1on and several private progra.mming agencies help carry out the Fulbright and interna-\u00b7 tional visitor programs. I am delighted both these organizations are represented here today. ' We in the Department of State are aware that our programs represent only a portion of. the total private-public participation in e anges aimed at furthering international m tua.l understanding. In addition to service organizations, professional associations of doctors, lawyers, journalists, municipal ad(cid:173)ministrators, and others link their members with counterparts throughout the world. More than 30 American sports organizations carry on international programs involving their athletes in competition, demonstra(cid:173)tions, and coaching clinics here and abroad; several youth organizations conduct inter(cid:173)national exchanges involving nearly 5,000 Americans and foreign teenagers annually. Numerous foundations, businesses, and insti;. tutions throughout America fac111tate the private studies of many of the nearly 150,000 foreign students who come to study in the United States annually and approximately half that number of Americans who study abroad each year. Private American performing arts groups tour other countries; reciprocal opportuni(cid:173)ties are offered to counterpart grouJ>s from abroad. The People-to-People Federation and its various committees actively promote and carry out meaningful exchanges; the sister city program of the Town Affiliation Associa\u00b7 tion links 430 American cities with communi(cid:173)ties in 63 countries of the world. In the Partners of the Americas program, 41 U.S. states are linked in two-way exchange pro(cid:173)grams with Partner states in countries of Latin America. I am sure many of you here today are also involved in Houston's sister city pro(cid:173)grams, which link this city with not just one but communities in the Far East, Europe and Latin America. These sister cities include Taipei, the capital of the Republic of China; Chiba City in Japan, Huelva, Spain; and Veracruz, Mexico. Before we undertook to encourage new ex(cid:173)change activities in the private sector re(cid:173)cently, we asked the cultural affairs officers in our Embassies around the world whether they wanted an increase in exchanges by private groups. They WeTe also asked whether these activities further our long-term pur\u00b7 pose of increasing mutual understanding with their respective countries. Almost with(cid:173)out exception the posts replied that they want increased exchanges. I have just re(cid:173)turned from USSR and Poland; our ambas(cid:173)sadors there are optimistic about prospects for new contacts with Eastern Europe. They want them to occur both to and from the United States. They confirmed that these activities contribute to removing barriers to understanding and to forming durable cooperative relationships. Last year the Bureau of Educationa.l and Cultural Affairs set up a special office respond to the needs of private organiza(cid:173)tions seeking to participate 1n international person-to-person programs. This Office of Priv81te Cooperation, on request, helps private organizations to active interna(cid:173)tionally. become tour to THE CONTRm'OTION OJ' SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS In government and 1n the private sector, there 1s much to be done. Service organiza(cid:173)tions, such as Rotary Intenl.ational, through its people-to-people programs, are doing an outstanding job. Rotary's international youth exchange, involving 700 youths throughout the world annually, is a model program with considerable impact. The Rotary Club matching program, which links Rotary Clubs in 150 countries with counterpart clubs for direct Rotarian-to(cid:173)Rotarian relationships , and shared project&, 18 equally impressive.

SENATE RESOLUTION 253---SUBMIS(cid:173)SION OF A RESOLUTION RELAT(cid:173)ING TO COMPARATIVE PRINTS OF CERTAIN BILLS AND JOINT RESO(cid:173)LUTIONS <Referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration.) Mr. HATHAWAY. Mr. President, to(cid:173)day I am submitting a resolution to ex(cid:173)tend the so-called Cordon rule of the Senate, rule XXIX(4), to cover the en(cid:173)tire process of bill consideration in the Senate committees. The Cordon rule, adopted by the Sen(cid:173)ate in 1949, requires that in reporting a bill to the Senate, a committee must pro(cid:173)vide an accompanying document show(cid:173)ing the text of the statute or part thereof Which is proposed to be repealed, and a comparative print of that part of the bill or joint resolution making the amend(cid:173)ment, and of the statute or part thereof proposed to be amended, showing by ap(cid:173)propriate typographical devices the omis(cid:173)sions and insertions which would be made by the bill or joint resolution if enacted in the form recommended by the comm:.ttee. The purpose of the Cordon rule is to make clear the effect of proposed legis(cid:173)lation on existing law. Both in terins of clarification and efficiency, the rule has proven helpful to Members of the Sen(cid:173)ate, and has undoubtedly expedited the floor work of the Senate. With the Sen(cid:173)ate workload increasing all the time, I feel we can utilize this helpful tool even more extensively in the legislative process. In the belief that the expanded ap(cid:173)plication of the Cordon rule would bene(cid:173)fit the Senate, I am introducing a resolu(cid:173)tion requiring that the rule apply during the most preliminary consideration in subcommittee hearings, through final \u00b7 committee consideration of a bill or reso(cid:173)lution. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con(cid:173)sent that the text of the resolution be printed in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the resolu(cid:173)tion was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: S. REs. 253 Resolved, That rule XXIX of the Stand(cid:173)ing Ru1es of the Senate 1s amended by add(cid:173)ing at the end thereof the following para \u2022 graph: \"5.

            "1104": "1104 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 29, 197 4 can cut costs and take all the business, they complain. Cost-conscious school board members of(cid:173)ten contend they are unaware of safety options available, or are convinced by dealers that minimum standard buses are adequate. As for those unsafe seat backs most school omcials queried said they had never heard that there are relatively inexpensive retrofit kits available for padding seat back tops. Maryland made such retrofitting mandatory two years ago. State legislators, such as lllinois' Rep. Peter Pappas (R-Rock Island), chairman of the House Motor Vehicles Committee, often say they are marking time on new school bus safety laws \"because we don't want to do something and then have the feds come along and require something different.\" Pappas, a longtime friend of most vehicle industry lobbyists, has all school bus safety legislation bottled up \"under study\" in his committee. It's been there since last spring, even though only one new federal safety standard is pending that would relate to any of those proposals. \u2022 One bottled measure, sponsored by Rep. Susan Catania (R-Ghicago) , calls for safety belts In new school buses. Another, intro(cid:173)duced by Rep. Sam McGrew (D-Geneseo), would require use of laminated safety glass throughout the bus; the use of safety gas tanks (now mandatory in New Jersey), plus padded seats and side-ralls. The school bus industry deriies that it ever fights such measures. The School Bus Manufacturer's Institute (SBMI) describes the industry as self regu(cid:173)lating with a proven concern for safe buses. But the industry's perforlll81nce seems some(cid:173)what at variance with its assertions. By the almost-universal estimate of the safety board, reform-minded legislators, and Ralph Nader's Center for Auto Safety, only two bus body makers--Wayne, of Richmond, Ind., and Ward, headquartered in Conway, Ark.-have initiated significant structural changes to enhance vehicle strength and safety. Both Wayne and Ward also have cam(cid:173)paigned vigorously for tougher federal safety standards. In contrast, the manufacturer's institute warns Congress and the National Highway Trame Safety Administration (NHTSA) not to push !or \"piecemeal\" adoption of new safety requirements, saying that standards must be considered for the whole bus. And then, only after lengthy research and testing. Meanwhile, the school bus manufacturing group this year belatedly set up a task force of its own, to study such overall standards. But the industry has failed to provide suf(cid:173)ficient financing and government funds are being sought. At the center of the school bus controversy is the National Hig1hway Trame Safety Ad(cid:173)mlnistra tion. The National Highway Safety Act of 1966 required the safety administration and its predecessor agency to set safety standards !or all motor vehicles-including school buses. But for yea.rs, the agency concentrated mostly on passenger cars, almost ignoring school buses, because acCident statistics in(cid:173)dicated school buses were \"40 times safer than cars.'\" Now those often-trumneted statistics an(cid:173)pear open to serious question. School bus accidents are soaring. In Dlinois, The Dally News found the totals were 6 times higher than those formerly reported by the state to the National Safety CouncU, the only agency that oompUes and publicizes them. Sim.llar problems have been found 1n other states. The safety administration's reaction mounting pressure from Capitol Hill and the public has been to give more lip service to progress, whlle increasing the actual speed to ~ of its efforts from the pace of a snail to that of a turtle. Initially, NHTSA \"met\" its obligations to school buses by promulgating some 40 safety standards-most of them for autos-and then announcing, muoh later, that 21 applied to school buses. However, only .five dealt primar(cid:173)ily with school buses' unique problems. And most of the buses' crucial problems were ignored. Here is a breakdown on the agency's action and inaction on school bus &afety, as of early December: Joint and seam structural strength: The issuance of a proposed standard, belatedly adopting the tougher joint strength require(cid:173)ments recommended two years ago by the federal Vehicle Equipment Safety Commis(cid:173)sion, has been promised by NHTSA for \"this calendar year.\" But it is not out yet; its final effective date remains a mystery ... and prob(cid:173)ably is far off. Seating: A long-delayed standard-calling fOO\" padded, high-backed, safety anchored seats-finally was proposed in February, 1973, and scheduled for \"issuance\" this year, to be effective in September, 1974. But it hasn't been issued yet, and NHTSA aides privately concede the padded seats probably won't be required until January, 1975. Operational safety-best known as Stand(cid:173)ard 17. First promised by the agency f9T July 1967, it was eventually proposed in July, 1970, and finally made effective tn June 1972-then the states were given an incredible five years to implement it. Eighteen months later, NHTSA still has not even sent the states a model training cur(cid:173)riculum-of the sort that repeatedly stresses defensive driving, where it is drummed into the bus drivers. that they must never take chances--such as venturing rashly into speeding cross-tramc on a rainy, murky after(cid:173)noon. That's what caused the Madison, Ind. crash. Brakes, whose malfunction the safety board found to be the mOb--t frequent cause of \"catastrophic\" school bus accidents. The effective dates for implementing 2-year-old standards requiring improved air and hydrau(cid:173)lic brakes are September of 1974 and 1975, re(cid:173)spectively, for all heavy vehicles including school buses. Yea Detroit is pushing to de(cid:173)lay the air brake standard untU September, 1975. Now, having finally loot patience with NHTSA's documented history of procraatl(cid:173)nation and obfuscation, Congress is prepar(cid:173)to move under the leadership of the House members such as Represent.e.-tives John Moss (D-Callf.), Les Aspin (D-Wis.) and Fred Rooney (D-Pa.), and Senators Warren Magnuson (D-Washlngton), Gaylord Nelson (D-Wis.), Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.), and Charles Percy (R.-lll.). Moss' Ho~ Commerce subcommittee al(cid:173)ready has approved a new auto recall blll that includes fiat requirements that NHTSA promptly issue certain school bus safety standards. And Magnuson's Senate Commerce Committee opens hearings on a similar meas-ure next month. , In preparation for the Senate hearings, NHTSA submitted data on the progress it is achieving in making the yellow school bus safer. The agency once more said it is moving ahead \"rapidly\"-which, Percy notes,~is ju.St wh&t the agency has been saytng since 1967 ... many, many deaths ago, ing VACANT AMBASSADOfUAL POS!r&_ Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in c<>n(cid:173)ducting relations between the United States and oth,er countries, our ambassa(cid:173)dors ~broad play a critical role -'l'b1s is true with regard to-the major countries of the world, especially during times of\" delicate negotiations with adversaries, and strained relations with allies. It is also true with regard to countries that are not in the mainstream of current policy, where their relations with the United States only rarely command the attention of th-e President, the Secretary of State, and other senior officials. There, the American ambassador becomes even more important than he would be other(cid:173)wise, and often plays the central role in shaping day-to-day policies of the Unit(cid:173)ed States, and relations between u.s and the country in which he serves. Ambassadors also play an important symbolic role. Appointing a man or wom(cid:173)an who is highly capable is a mar~ of respect, and can pay direct benefits in the process of conducting relations. By contrast,-appointing second-rate people as American ambassadors can make matters worse. And not appointing an American ambassador at all can be re(cid:173)garded as an insult and a direct impedi(cid:173)ment to good relations, or-at best-as a handicap to working out diplomatic problems and difficulties. It is important for us in the Senate, therefore, to note vacancies of long standing in U.S. ambassadorial posts abroad. It is with particular regret that I note the continued absence of a U.S. ambas(cid:173)sador to Sweden, since August 30, 1973. We all know the reasons for this: Swed(cid:173)ish criticism of U.S. bombing policies at the end of our involvement in the Viet(cid:173)nam war, and the granting of asylum by Sweden to some Americans who refused to fight in that war. Whatever we think about these Swed(cid:173)ish policies, the failure to appoint an Ambassador to Stockholm, at tbis criti(cid:173)cal time in the energy crisis and in the reordering of international economic re(cid:173)lations, is clearly not in the best terests of the United States. In addition, we also have not had an Ambassador in Libya since November 7, 1972, a period which has seen the most serious tunnoil in international oil mar(cid:173)to kets. do n,ot wish imply that the presence of a U.S. Ambassador in Tripoli would have had a decisive impact: But at least we would have had better oppor(cid:173)tunities for direct communication at the appropriate level. Far more important, the United States has not .had an Ambassador to the Or(cid:173)ganization for Economic Cooperation and Development-OECD-since Sep(cid:173)tember 1972-nearly a year and a half. And yet this has been a critical t>eriod in trying to reach common pOsitions in the stlppl:1 of energy, through the OEcn\u00b7s on committee. On February 11, thE; U.S. Government will convene a meeting of foreign min(cid:173)ister from eight major oil importing na(cid:173)tions, to discuss the formation of an en(cid:173)ini~iative ,J>Y \u00b7Secretary Kissinger~ \u00b7as a fl:rst step toward worldwldercooperation ergy action group.

            "1154": "1154 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 29, 1974 in his First, the gasoline stocks, however, are going down very fast. So, we\u00b7 are facing a very critical situation in the second quarter of this year barring some kind of solution in the Mideast. It is the judg(cid:173)ment of a lot of people who are follow(cid:173)ing this problem that gasoline rationing will take effect. The answer is that stocks are up a slight bit over a year ago, due primarily to weather conditions. But gasoline is going down. Gasoline was up at one point. How(cid:173)ever, the testimony was that inventories are going down. I do not know what the situation is overseas. We have asked these companies the questions under oath. We shall have follow-up interrogatories to get to the .P&rticular points that the Senator has in mind and to determine whether there are inventories anyplace else. They have sworn under oath that they do not have anything other than that which they have revealed. Mr. McGOVERN. There are publicly released figures that show at least a modest increase in oil company reserves now over a year ago. Mr. JACKSON. The Senator is correct. However, when we break it down, it is in the middistillatc area. Gasoline is going down, because they are still refin(cid:173)ing heating oil. We have benefited from the weather. Because of the weather we may be faced with having a glut of heating oil. Mr. McGOVERN. I know that the Senator from Washington has been very vigorous interrogation of these companies. I do not need to remind the Senator that these are the same com(cid:173)panies that told us 3 or 4 years ago that there was not any shortage and that we did not need to lift the import quotas. I wanted to remind the Senator that their judgment and facts are not always right. Mr. JACKSON. The Senator is correct. I wrote a letter to Secretary Shultz in 1969 denouncing the archaic quotas set on oil. The problem is a d.imcult one which we are following up in the committee. The staff met with the representatives on yesterday. We are asking all of the questions the Senator referred to as a followup, so that we can find out specif(cid:173)ically what happened. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Presiden.Jt, I commend the Senator from Washington for his action. Mr. JACKSON. I commend the Sena(cid:173)tor from South Dakota for raising the questions on the floor of the Senate. Mr. President, I wonder if the Sena(cid:173)tor from Wisconsin would take a little time now. I believe that the Senator has more time than we do. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen(cid:173)ator from Washington has 5 minutes re(cid:173)maining. The Senator from Wisconsin has 7 minutes remaining. Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will Senator yield at that point? Mr. NELSON. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana. Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I have yet to hear anyone refer to the fact that this measure is unconstitutional. We have the testimony of tax lawyer after tax lawyer, many of whom have served as Commissioners of Internal Revenue the Service under the Truman administra(cid:173)tion, the Johnson administration, the Kennedy administration, and the Nixon administration, who they say that they \u00b7think the proposal is unconstitutional. If that proposal is unconstitutional, it may well bring down the whole bill with it. So the whole bill may be declared un(cid:173)constitutional. It is very simple. This constitutes a taking without due process. It says that if someone takes what we believe to be an unfair profit, we might look at all of his profits and tell the man to give back anything that he has received that is more than a fair profit. Now the Renegotiation Act is able to bypass that issue because there is a con(cid:173)tract between the Government and the Government contractor to give the money back. I know a very able lawyer in New York who said that he thinks that pro(cid:173)vision is bad. I think that we can repeal it later and substitute something else. Here is what the witnesses say. If a company produces more oil than it had in that base period, he has to give back 100 percent of everything that he has made or he is guilty of price gouging. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I yield 1 additional minute to the Senator from Louisiana. Mr. LONG. Mr. President, the people will say, \"You will not accuse me of price gouging. I will not produce that much oil.\" Look at the list of all the companies up there on the board. They made more profits than they made in a depressed period. We should not be giving them an incentive to produce less oil than they did before so that they will not be ac(cid:173)cused of price gouging. That is ridiculous. We ought to be encouraging people to produce more energy. When we put that provision on the stat(cid:173)ute books, lawyer after lawyer who has had responsibility in this matter has said that people will be confronted with un(cid:173)certainty and that, if they invest their money, they cannot get it back. Bankers will not make loans to companies that want to produce more oil. Mr. President. bankers wUl not make loans to companies who want to drill wells and produce more oil and process more oil. They will say that it is doubt(cid:173)ful whether the company will be per(cid:173)mitted to earn enough money to pay off the loan. so. we would get less oil and less gas in due course if we were to follow method. Why would we want to do that if we could take our time and pass a law that would be constitutional? We would then be doing what we swore to do when we took our oath of office. to uphold the Constitution. Mr. BENTSEN. Mr. President, is it not true that there are approximately 220,-000 service stations in this country, that 70 to 80 percent of those stations are in(cid:173)dependent operators, that there wCi'iiiObe individual decisions with respect to each of them with respect to the sale of gaso(cid:173)line, that any citizen might object to any one of those stations and a hearing would have to be held, and that would result in this a legislative nightmare. There is no way in which that could feasibly be accom(cid:173)plished. Mr. LONG. And every one of those 220,000 service stations can be hauled into court under the Renegotiation Board for every sale they make to every customer. So that board could meet from now to eternity, and would not have settled all its cases. Mr. BENTSEN. Does the Senator from Louisiana remember the service station operators who were here last year be(cid:173)cause they were having problems in this regard? Mr. LONG. I certainly do. Mr. BENTSEN. Does he not think they would be back again with the same kind of problems? Mr. LONG. I certainly do. Mr. Presi(cid:173)dent, I expect to vote for the kind of ex(cid:173)cess profits tax that would work, and would not keep us from getting energy for the American people at a time when they need it desperately. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, what we are really doing if we approve this bill is playing a gigantic con game on the American public, because it is not con(cid:173)stitutional, it will not work, and it is not a tax, and I do not think the President. on his worst day, could conceivably sign this bill. Nevertheless, I think we ought to rec(cid:173)ognize who we are putting a burden on with this bill. That is, the local gasoline station owners and it will bankrupt them. They cannot live under it. Think of a situation where the Presi(cid:173)dent sets the price at the retail level, and then the fllling station operator follows the price the President sets. Then along come a bunch of customers and complain that the price he charged, based upon what the President set, gives him an ex(cid:173)cess profit, so they go up to the Renego(cid:173)tiation Board, which has the authority under the law to decide that in fact, after using all these guidelines I read into the RECORD, he is charging an excess amount. So then they haul him before the Re(cid:173)negotiation Board, with maybe 10 com(cid:173)plaints or 50 complaints, and now he has got to pay back money. There is no way in the world, under the free enterprise system, for any re(cid:173)tailer to survive under this provision. The Senator from Washington and the Sena(cid:173)tor from Maine both know it is a bad provision. They will both say so. They both voted against it. Yet they want to stick by the provision because they say that is all they can get out of the confer(cid:173)ence. Now let us look at the argument that there are a bunch of urgent things in here. I just called WILBUR MILLS and talked with him at home, and I asked him about whether, if something hap(cid:173)pened at this conference and they did not come back with any agreement, he considered it important that we have some unemployment compensation act provision such as is in this blll, or better. He said, \"Yes, we have got to do something about those who are unem(cid:173)ployed.\" So we have the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee who has a posi(cid:173)tion on it, we have the chairman of t>he ",

Mr. Chairman, I wish to go on record as supporting H.R. 11793, a bill to reorganize and consolidate cer(cid:173)tain functions of the Federal Govern\u00b7 ment in a new Federal Energy Admin(cid:173)istration in order to promote more em(cid:173)cient management of such functions. This legislation will establish by law the agency which has hitherto been operating under executive order. I wholeheartedly support the concept of unifying under one omcial the various related energy functions which rational formulation of a coordinated national energy policy demands. The forward strides that have already been made by the present Federal Energy Office under William E. Simon offer a refreshing and long-awaited change from the chaos and false steps of previous so-called \"energy czars\" and \"advisers.\" I feel that H.R. 11793, by setting a 2-year authorization period for the FEA, puts a sensible limit on the lifespan of our emergency energy regulatory ap(cid:173)paratus. Provision is made in the bill for Presidential recommendations for either continuance or other disposition of the functions assembled under the aegis of the Federal Energy Administrator. I feel that one lesson that we ought to have ~earned by the experience of the last year Is that regular and frequent reviews of our energy policymaking procedures and goals are a necessity if we are not again to be caught as fiat-footed as we were by the Arab boycott. Mr. Chairman, I am aware that some Members are alarmed by what they char(cid:173)acterize as the sweeping breadth of power which has been deputized to the FEA by this legislation. I think it impor(cid:173)tant to point out--as is already evident from the workings of the present Federal Energy Office-that the President al(cid:173)ready possesses the powers that it is feared will so strengthen the Executive Office. Last spring Congress renewed the Economic Stabilization Act, under which the President has since authorized the creation of the Federal Energy Office and assembled various energy functions. I favor passage of H.R. 11793 because it will enhance congressional control over the new FEA. If this bill becomes law, all the principal officers of the FEA will necessarily have to be confirmed by the Senate. Further, congressional ap(cid:173)proval will be mandated at the end of 2 years for any further energy regulation and policymaking vehicle. The interim period will have afforded all of us in this body and in the other House the oppor(cid:173)tunity to appraise the benefits and draw(cid:173)backs of this agency. At that point, we will be able to act on information our own senses have gathered. Despite my endorsement of this legis(cid:173)lation, I am troubled in particular by one aspect of this bill and its near relation, the conference report on the Energy Emergency Act <S. 2589). Neither piece of legislation takes, to my mind, a firm enough stand upon perhaps the most crucial issue raised by the national en(cid:173)ergy crisis. Quite simply, where are our national priorities? Do they lie with some ill-conceived, vague entity-the marketplace-or do they have their foundation in the well(cid:173)being of our people? It seems to me that the most dangerous and insidious issue amidst this whole energy debate is the view, quite openly stated and restated by top administration figures, including Mr. Simon, that 1f prices go high enough de(cid:173)mand will eventually mesh with supply and presto, no more shortages. This philosophy seems to me to ignore the fact that energy-whether it be used to heat homes, carry people to work or school or run factories--is not some imaginary commodity in an economics textbook. It is a rockbottom necessity. If ",
            "1254": "1254 wide range of. competing interests that faced the law makers. \u00b7 Auto manufacturers have been pleading with Congress to make a decision by the end of this year on auto emissions, so Detroit could decide whether or not to install cata(cid:173)lytic converters on its 1976 model year cars. A decision to freeze the standards at the 1ntertm. 1975 level (or to continue on the current, tougher schedule favort:.d by EPA) would mean that the 1976 models would have to be equipped with catalytic convert(cid:173)ers. On the other hand, a decision to freeze standards at the 1974 level would mean that the converters would not have to be used. Companies that make catalysts were lob(cid:173)bying for an extension at the interim 1975 level. \"It's the catalyst people and us against the rest of them on this one,\" said one en(cid:173)vironmentalist, who, with his colleagues, was attempting to ward off any substantive amendment to the Clean Air Act. \u00b7 Since catalysts require unleaded gas, firms that manufacture lead additives were seek(cid:173)ing a freeze at the 1974 emission levels, which do not require catalysts. And since it takes more on to make a gal(cid:173)lon of unleaded gasoline than it does to make a gallon of leaded gasoline, the oll in(cid:173)dustry campaigned for the 1974 standards on the grounds that it would enable the coun(cid:173)try to save fuel. The Administration through Love, and later Sawhill, had asked for a two-year freeze at the interim 1975 1~;-els. However, during the open markup sessions of the Commerce Committee and at an un(cid:173)usual open markup meeting of Rogers' sub(cid:173)committee on the auto emissions amend(cid:173)ment, no representatives of the energy office were to be seen. But in attendance were several officials of EPA, who wanted no change at all. \"It was really a fascinating thing,\" said one environmental lobbyist. \"No one really knew who was speaking for the Administra(cid:173)tion.\" Subcommittee During a supper recess of the full Com(cid:173)merce Committee, Rogers' subcommittee met at 7: 15 p.m. on Dec. 6 to vote on an auto emission amendment to recommend to its parent body, scheduled to reconvene at 7:30. It was the second such meeting in two days. \"I've never heard so much confiicting tes(cid:173)timony on any subject in my life,\" said an exasperated Rep. H. John Heinz III, R-Pa., referring to the three days of hearings the subcommittee conducted during the full committee markups on Dec. 8, 4 and 5 and the more extensive hearings in the fall. After some entreating by Rogers, the sub(cid:173)committee voted 9-1 to approve an amend(cid:173)ment extending the interim 1975 standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide through 1976. The EPA administrator was given the option of extending them another year. For nitrogen oxide emissions, the present requirement of 3.1 grams per mile (gpm) would be frozen through the 1976 model year. The 1977 requirement would be 2.0 gpm, which under the present schedule would have had to be met by 1976 autos. The EPA administrator was authorized to grant five one-year suspensions up untll the 1983 model year, on a year-by-year basis, for nitrogen oxides. Opposing the Rogers' amendment was Rep. WUliam H. Hudnutt m, R-Ind. Rep. David E. Satterfield III, D-Va., did not vote and said he would offer an amendment in full committee to freeze the standards at the 1974 level. Full committee The markup sessions of the full commit(cid:173)tee, particularly on Dec. 6 and 7 when time constraints severely limited debate, were busy with amendments as lobbyists jockeyed for legislative positions. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS 1f \"I think I'm sitting in the midst of a bliz(cid:173)zard here,\" said Rep. John D. Dingell, D(cid:173)Mlch., during one particularly hectic stretch of the final markup session. \"Every time I look up someone's handing me an amend(cid:173)ment that's not even being considered.\" At its night meeting on Dec. 6, the com(cid:173)mittee adopted the Rogers' amendment on auto emissions by voice vote after defeat(cid:173)ing, 12-22, a Satterfield amendment to freeze the standards at the 1974 level. It also turned back an amendment by Rep. James Har(cid:173)vey, R-Mich., to hold the interim 1975 stand(cid:173)ards through 1977 by a 16-19 vote. On the next day, Staggers sucessfully of(cid:173)fered an amendment that would allow power plants to burn coal untll 1980 they switched from oil. (Staggers' congressional district includes large deposits of low-sulfur coal.) The Staggers amendment did not soothe the coal interests. National Coal Association president Carl E. Bagge said in an interview that the industry needs a commitment in the range of 20 years or assurances that coal will be used for as long as it is more readily available than gas or oil. The committee also accepted on voice vote apparently contradicting amendments on stationary sources, .one by Rep. John M. Mur(cid:173)phy, D-N.Y., to allow power companies to use \"intermittent controls\" such as high smokestacks and the burning of high-sulfur fuels on windy days, and one by Symington, which would have allowed variances to be granted until 1979 but which prohibited violation of primary ambient air quality standards. The final version, hammered out by com(cid:173)mittee lawyers and aides to individual mem(cid:173)bers after the blll was ordered reported, stlll allowed the use of intermittent controls for long-term variances. Symington, who feared that such measures would permit unaccep(cid:173)table levels of pollution, tried unsuccessfully to change the language on the floor. The provision to halt EPA parking sur(cid:173)charges came from Rogers' subcommittee and passed the full committee on voice vote. Rog(cid:173)ers said pressure for the measure came par(cid:173)ticularly from the California and Texas del(cid:173)egations, whose constituents were particul\u00b7 arly affected by EPA proposals \"In California, they were planning to hold some shopping centers to 50 parking spaces,\" Rogers said in an interview. Auto industry The major automobile manufacturers have been divided on their approach to the use of catalysts, and they also were splintered in their reaction to the committee's decision to include provisions on auto emissions in the emergency blll. William C. Chapman, manager of General Motors Corp's technical liaison group, sa.ld the committee acted responsibly. GM has made a public commitment to the use of catalysts in its 1975 models and has testlfied that catalysts can result in a fuel savings of up to 18 per cent. Chapman and GM prefers to see a decision made by the end of the year on the matter, whether or not that decision is done as part of the b111 that finally emerges from the House-Senate conference. Ford Motor Co., which has said It will install catalysts on about 65 per cent of its 1975 cars, had favored freezing the 1974 ste.ndards !or\u00b7two years. Wayne H. Smithey, director of Ford's oflice of national affairs, said that because of the pressing nature of the industry's timetable, it \"seems the best way to get that\" would be to have auto emission language similar to that voted by the House committee included ln the emergency bill. Both Ford and Chrysler Corp. had testified that any fuel savings gained through use of catalysts-Ford said a 1 to 4 per cent saving could result whlle Chrysler said there might January 29, 1974 to be a. loss-would be offset by the additional amounts of on needed to produce unleaded gas. Even after the House committee vote to include auto emissions in the emergency blll, Chrysler was sticking its position that there should be a freeze on the 1974 stand(cid:173)ards. A spokesman for Chrysler, which has been the most adamant of the major manufac(cid:173)turers in opposing the use of catalysts, said the Commerce Committee decision to include auto emissions has not changed his com(cid:173)pany's position. \"We haven't come off that position at all,'' he said. Asked whether Chrysler would prefer to go with the House version or to ignore the auto emissions completely, as the Senate bUl does, he said: \"We haven't made that choice; we're stlll for the 1974 standards.\" Oil The American Petroleum Institute, whose membership includes the giant oil com~a.nies, favored extension of the 1974 standards and was critical of the decision to extend them at the interim 1975 level. \"If they had taken that vote three weeks from now, there would have been a di1ferent result,\" said Arne E. Gubrud, API's director of environmental affairs, in reference to the committee's decision on the interim 1975 extension. \"I don't think most people realize how serious the oil situation is. \"One of the points that escaped attention during the recent hearings was that we're going to have a reduction in gas consump(cid:173)tion anyway due to shifts in refinery pro(cid:173)duction, the lowering of speed limits and things like that. Along with this wlll be a. corresponding reduction in emissions. \"But by going from the 1974 standard to the interim 1975 standard, you only achieve a 1 per cent drop in emissions. And at the same time you use more on in making un(cid:173)leaded gasoline for catalysts.\" Gubrud said API's calculations indicate a fuel economy of about 3 per cent from use of catalysts, adding that this would not offset losses accruing from the require(cid:173)ment to produce unleaded gas. A spokesman for Gulf 011 Corp. said that EPA regulations, promulgated on Nov. 28, mandating a phase-down over the next five years of the amount of lead 1n gasoline, would \"really hurt us\" when combined with the need to produce unleaded gasoline for catalysts. The EPA limitations, designed to protect public health, require a 60 per cent to 65 per cent reduction of the lead content In gasoline, bringing the level down to .5 gram per gallon by Jan. 1, 1979. EPA has estimated that it will cost the oil industry some $75 million for stocks, operating and capital costs at the refinery to finance the phase-down process. Lead additive firms Ethyl Corp., world's largest producer of lead additive products, had lobbied hard to have the emission standards frozen at the 1974level. Howard E. Hesselberg, Ethyl vice president and director of air conservation, said that the use of catalysts and the EPA phase-down \"wUl, 1f they run their course, have a serious Impact on the a.valla.blllty of crude oll.\" Hesselberg said Ethyl \"conservatively\" estimates that it w111 take 1 per cent to 2 per cent more crude oil to produce a gallon of nonleaded gasoline over the same amount of typicaJ. leaded gas. He also said it will require 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent more crude to achieve the 1.7 grams per gallon level mandated by EPA for Jan. 1, 1975. \"We firmly belleve that catalysts have some problems and that the auto industry wm develop a high-compression engine that wm achieve emission standards 'by using leaded gasoline,\" Hesselberg said.

Indeed.. the atmosphere \u00b7Is remlnls-members. Each section 18 run a little differ(cid:173)cent of a college. The adult hospital, which ently, depending on the doctor in charge, but houses 160 patients, resembles a dormitory. typically the patients ln eacb. .section are Rooms awl hallways are carpeted. Nurses divided into four teams. Each team meets and doctors wear ordinary street clothes, four times a week with the sta.ff members. not white unUorms. !Patients and staff eat An agenda is drawn up and minutes are together in the same dining room. kept. Usually the meeting lasts about an hour. During the sessions, the patients and staff members through a majority-rule proc(cid:173)ess make treatment decisions, among other things. They might, for instance. decide whether a patient should be allowed to take a bus into town alone. If staff members or other patients have noticed that the pa(cid:173)tient is particularly depressed, they may de(cid:173)cide he needs extra attention and shouldn't be allowed in town alone. Ultimately the team doctor is responsible for the decision, but the majority-patients and staff-rules, and the doctor simply ratifies the action by signing the order. Patients also are given a voice in govern(cid:173)ing the hospital. Patient government pro(cid:173)vides a setting for staff members to observe patients' behavior, but it also teaches them how to deal with responsibility, doctors say. Says one patient: \"I don't care what hospital I've been in (he has been in three-two public and one other private), they were trying to teach you to be responsible. But in all the other hospitals the staff did everything. For you to be able to assume responsibility. they have to give you responsibility.\" Patient representatives are elected from each section to a 25-member council. Staff representatives serve on another council and a liaison committee has representatives from both councils. Issues range from how to deal with drugs or suicide to planning lei(cid:173)sure-time activities. In one case patients wanted to serve champagne at a New Year's Eve party. The hospital council ap(cid:173)proved the idea and the patient council set the limits-one glass per person. The occa(cid:173)sion was successful, and the champagne caused no problems. During the day patients move freely among various buUdings that house doctors' offices, manual arts shops, a gymnasium, canteen and other facilities. Few if any patients are restrained in any way. Hospital doors are locked. -at u p.m. and opened at 6 a.m. There are n(} locked. wards. Occasionally, patients do ileave the grounds without permission(cid:173)they can lt \"eloping\"-but the foundation hardly ever has to request aid from Topeka pollee tn finding them. Most return volun(cid:173)tarily after a few hours. AU patients are con(cid:173)sidered to be at the center voluntarily, and under Kansas law they can leave legally after giving ftve days' notice. Beven Menningers are currently associated witll the foundation, including Roy, the president. Of the original founders, only Karl living. Now 60 years old, he is chainna.n. 'Of the board of trustees. Will. died in 1968, Will's and Karl's father in 1953. Karl's only son, Robert, is a. trustee and dl(cid:173)re\u00b7ct()l' of the foundation's museum and ar-chives. WiU's wife is a trustee. Roy's brother Philip holds an administrative post connected with fund raising. Another brother, Walter. is on \"loan\" from the foundation to Topeka State Hospital, where he heads the 'Clinic. Edwin, a brother of Karl an.d. W111 wh:o has never been employed by the organlzatioll, is a trustee. Much of the power and responsibility for running the foundation rests with Roy, who W'9oS elected president in 1967, succeeding his father. Uad.er his leadership the organization is undergoing numerous changes. In the treatment area, the old virtually total em(cid:173)phasis on psychoanalysis, where a patient sits down for long talks with a psychiatrist to explore the patient's past, ls being modi(cid:173)fled. Psychoanalysis is still used, but so are a number of other approaches. Today the entire hospital-patients and. staff-is viewed as an experimental social setting ln which patients carry out social tasks and the staff studies the emotional difficulties that the patients encounter. \"In(cid:173)stead of a patient simply sitting with a psy(cid:173)chotherapist nd. talking about the past, things are happening here in the hospital right now that can be observed,\" says Dr. Peter Hartocollis, hospital director. Why does Menninger believe this ap(cid:173)proach 1:8 better than psychoanalysis alone? \"The sicker a patient the less able he is to understand. what he's doing. When a patient ts too sick to be able to tell about himself. if the only thing fOU do is talk with him you only get a very partial and very distorted picture of b.is problem,\" Dr. Hartocollis says. \"'We want to get the full picture and then help the patient see it.\" Under the system patients play an impor(cid:173)tant role ln helping other patients get well. The former Michigan coed tells how they've helped her: ''If I don't keep in contact with reality and work very hard at it, I can get way oft' into fantasies. So I just keep talk(cid:173)ing to people. A lot of times I can think something is 'Very real and that I'm being very ra.ttona.i, but they'll tell me I'm really very confused.'' How :can <Qne mentally ill person know another ts confused? \"People aren't crazy 24 hours a d y, .. .she says. ~\u00b7rt\u2022s an episode. You have your ups and downs.\" Patients can. help <luring their rational periods. THE GOAL IS CHANGE The main goal of the Menninger program 1s to bring about basic changes in the per(cid:173)sonality. From that standpoint the hospital is different from many psychiatric hospitals whose goal is to deal with an emotional cri(cid:173)sis, help the patient pull himself together(cid:173)at least temporarily-and get back to ordi(cid:173)nary life. 'The Menninger approach also differs from what has been going on in mental health generally during the past decade. Emphasis in the field, generally has been on closing mental hospitals and treating pa(cid:173)tients in the community while they Uve at home. Often that simply shifts the problem into the community, \"where it is lost,\" says Dr. Roy Menninger. nHere we haven't gone &long with the view that mental hospitals are passe and that there's no longer a need for an isolated and specialized environment to treat ill people.\" The hospital is .still an important tool for diagnosis as well as treat(cid:173)ment, he contends. The Menninger d\u00b7octors believe ,that what they learn from working with patients in the hospital may have broad social application. The foundation has already tried two pilot projects in this area. In both instances it sent a two-man team into communities to cool tensions between groups--in Lawrence, Kan., between blacks, Indians and Chicanos on the one hand and the police on the other, and in Plainfield, N.J., between the school board and the city council, which were at odds ostensibly over school integration. \"The team was composed of trained menta1-healtl1 workers,\" says Dr. Mennin(cid:173)ger. \"They knew how to listen to what wasn't being said. They understand the im(cid:173)pact of feelings on behavior. They knew 'MAJ'OlUTY RULE Th hospital is organized to promote this kin~ of interaction. It is divided into sec-something &bout group behavl-or and how .crazy people can act when they become members -of a group. And they understood the irrational. As a result, they were able to reestablish a climate of trust. The two peo(cid:173)ple weren't \u00b7practicing psychiatry, but they would have never been so successful had they not been trained in working with men(cid:173)tally sick people.\" 'THE FLAT PANCAKE Besides adopting new approaches to mental illness, the foundation is slowly changing from what has been called. a fami(cid:173)ly-held proprietorship run by two brillian.t, charismatic individuals to a corporate insti(cid:173)tution with professional management. \"Karl and my father attracted some brilliant peo(cid:173)ple, but they built no substructure of .sup(cid:173)portive leadership.\" Dr. Roy Menninger says. \"They were tt, and everybody else was not of a flat pancake.\" As a. result, he says, the organization \"had flairs of brilliance and drama-and. tt had considerable inefficiency. When I came into this job I found. a 1lisorganized organi(cid:173)zation somewhat akin to confused and. angry children whose very forceful parents had suddenly departed ... Among other things, the Wharton ,S<:h'Ool of Finance has been commissioned to help prepare a year-long study of the foundatiOD., its future goals anti how to reach them. In addition, the SO-member board of trustees that is ultimately accountable for the foun(cid:173)dation's operation is being built into a more aggressive body. \"In the past it's been kind of a mutual(cid:173)admiration society,\" says one observer, \"Will Menninger put anybody on the bo&rd. he liked or who he thought liked ihim ... Now new members, like 48-year-old Harvey Kap(cid:173)nick, head of the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen Co. who was elected. a trustee ln April, are chosen with an eye toward adding management know-how or other skills nd toward lowerin.g the average age, which iS around 70. LOS ANGELES MAYOR THOMAS BRADLEY Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would. like to place in the RECORD an article from the New York Times magazine about Los Angeles' new mayor, Thomas Bradley.

The debt has soared to the point where it takes 17 cents of every individual and corporation income tax dollar to pay the interest-just the interest-on the debt. think it is clear that the Federal budget is out of control Spending is out of control. And that~ in my view, is the chief rea(cid:173)son why inflation is out of control. I might say that I am not alone in that view . .Among those who have pub(cid:173)licly stated the same opinion is William McChesney Martin, the former Chair(cid:173)man of the Federal Reserve Board. If we are going to make any real progress in the fight against inflation, we must get control of Federal spending. That is why it is so important that the Congress take action to reform its budg(cid:173)etary procedures. So long as we deal with the budget in 13 unrelated appropriat(cid:173)tions bills every year, and pile up long(cid:173)term authorizations for .spending both through the fr-ont door and the back door, Congress will not be able to fu11ill its rightful.responsibilities. The principle of budgetary coordina(cid:173)tion involved in the Congressional Budget Act is a vital one, and I endorse this principle. Nevertheless, I feel the pending legis(cid:173)lation does not go far enough. I believe that we must go further(cid:173)that we must get back to the principle of .a .balanced budget. Until we restore that principle, I think that inflation will continue unchec~ed. On July 18 of last year., President Nixon stated: The key to 1n1ccess of our anti-lntlation effort ls the budget . \u2022\u2022 I propose that we should now take a balanced budget as 1>ur goal \u2022\u2022 'I think the President spoke wisely on that occasion. From the proposed deficit of $18 million in Federal funds in his new budget, he has not ifonowed his own ad(cid:173)vice, but it remains good .advice. It is vital that we get away from the huge deficits that the Government has been runn1ng in recent years. ~note that in subsection 30Ha.) (4) of the bill before us-on page 121-lt Is stated that the proposed new budget com(cid:173)mittees in their first concurrent resolu(cid:173)tion shall recommend-The amount, if any, by which revenues should ezceec1 budget outlays, or by whlch budget 1>ntlays should exceed Tevenues, con(cid:173)sidering economic conditions and all other relevant factors \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 truck Now that ls a loophole big -enough to drive a through--an armored truck, loaded with the taxpayers' money. As I have said, I favor the basic prin(cid:173)ciple of this legislation-the e1fort to eo(cid:173)ordinate the handling cof the budget in the Congress. But we must plug that loophole. In an e1fort to do \u00b7so-to restore the principle of a balanced budget-I shall present amendments at the appropriate time. I hope that the Senate wlll seize the opportunity presented by this legisla(cid:173)tion to can a halt to the enonnous deficits which are adding fuel to the fires of 1ntlatlon.

Mr. Presi(cid:173)dent, I think it is very important that Congress takes steps to refol'm its budg(cid:173)etary procedures. I think that the pend(cid:173)legislation certainly lays a good foundation. There are aspects of the pending legislation, however. that it oc(cid:173)curs to me will not bring about the de(cid:173)sired results of fiscal discipline and fiscal responsibility unless they are changed. I wonder tf I might ask several ques(cid:173)tions of the distinguished ranking mi(cid:173)nority member of the committee. Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, I would be delighted to have such questions as the distinguished Senator from Virginia would like to ask. Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi(cid:173)dent, on page 121 of the blll. the state(cid:173)ment Is made that the resolution .shall set forth: (4) RECOMMENDED SURPLUS ORDEFICIT.-The amount. 1f any, by which revenues should exceed budget outlays, or by whlch bu~get outlays should exceed revenues, eonstdertng economic conditions and all other relevant factors; Am I correct in my understanding that the resolution is not required to bring in .a balanced budget? ~.PERCY. The Senator is correct. Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Therefore, a. resolution can provide for a deficit of % number of dollars, $18 billion as project(cid:173)ed for the eurrent fiscal year. and say that under present conditions that is thought to be the appropriate deficit. Mr. PERCY. The distinguished Sena(cid:173)tor from Virginia is correct. Not only that, but lt was also the very strong feeling of members of the Government Operations Committee, and possibly of the Committee on Rules and Adminis(cid:173)tration, in looking over the\u00b7 budget that it would be unwise to put the Congress in a straitjacket and require a balanced budget each and every single fiscal year. It for instance, the country were to go into a period of recession where the eco(cid:173)nomic activity was low .and where the de(cid:173)mands for assistance and help in pro(cid:173)viding employment, or whatever, might be quite high, the economy would re(cid:173)quire or almost demand stimulus in the Federal budget, and this would give the discretion to Congress to do so. Those who feel that the country should have a balanced budget regardless of the cir(cid:173)cumstances could not prevail and v.ote in a balanced budget. The objective that we have a balanced budget, may be very desirable-but it is also to be hoped that we would have a period in which we could start paying o1f the national debt. However, there is no .requirement in the pending measure that we have a balanced budget. At the outset we should recognize that this would give us the ftexibntty to either further the national debt or enable us to pay down the previous deficit. Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi(cid:173)-dent, the Senator from Tilinois is quite optimistic about being able to pay down the previous debt. I note that 25 percent .of the national debt will have been incurred in the fiscal year ending 1975; .25 percent of that debt will have been added in a 6-year period, from fisca11970 to fiscal l975. We are going in the opposite direction from paying o1f the debt. We are adding to it at .a rate that we have never added to it before in the history of the Natien. Mr. PERCY. The Senator from lllinois would not argue at an with that stare(cid:173)ment. The Senator from Illlinois abhors the fact that in a period .of a hlgh level of prosperity and activity and ttlm<>st rampant inftation, we have .aggravated and added $1'00 billion of .additional debt which only adds to the penn anent n(cid:173)nancing charges for the national debt, puts mol'e of the budget in an uncon(cid:173)trollable account and adds undoubtedly to the indebtedness of future generations. Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. And it adds to the existing inflation at this time~ Mr. PERCY. The Senator is eorr.ect. Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi(cid:173)dei!lt, Secretary ShUltz in testifying be(cid:173)fore the Committee on Finance put the in:flation :at 10 pereent. I believe tlhat he I said that was a staggering rate of infta(cid:173)tion. am not positive those were his exact words. However~ to my mind it is a staggering rate of inflation. May I ask the Senator another ques(cid:173)tion? We are now coping with 14 di1ferent a;ppropriations bills ln Congress. Under the pending legislation, we will still have the same 14.separate appr.opriations bllls. Mr. PERCY. The Senator is correct; the :figure may be 13, though they will still be handled separately. Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi(cid:173)dent, how are they tied together before Congress adjourns? How are these sep(cid:173)arate bills tied together so that Congress will have to total amount? Mr. PERCY. First of an. obviously, as \u2022",

I wish to compli(cid:173)ment the subcommittee for its very care ... ful work in this area and its concern on that very specific problem. Mr. ROGERS. Mr. Speaker, I am sure the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from West Virginia <Mr. STAGGERS) would agree-with that inter(cid:173)pretation. Mr. STAGGERS. Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from Florida. Mr. NELSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentle(cid:173)man from Kentucky (Mr. CARTER). Mr. CARTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member of the committee for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill H.R. 12503, the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act, to provide for the registration of practitioners conducting narcotic treat(cid:173)ment programs. Although the artificial narcotic metha(cid:173)done does not afford a permanent solu(cid:173)tion to the problem of heroine addiction, many treatment programs involving the use of methadone have had some suc(cid:173)cess. The number of patients now par(cid:173)ticipating in these programs is estimated to be 73,000, and the FDA is receiving a large number of applications for the use of this drug. With the increasingly widespread use of methadone there is the inevitable problem of its illegal sale and use. This legislation is designed to strengthen con(cid:173)trol over such programs and to prevent the increasing numbers of deaths from methadone overdoses. Through improved enforcement meth(cid:173)ods and improved treatment techniques, we are making forward strides in over(cid:173)coming the drug abuse problem in Amer(cid:173)ica. This legislation, by the increased regulation of methadone and other nar(cid:173)cotic drugs used in the treatment of nar(cid:173)cotic addicts, is necessary if we are to effectively continue our efforts in this important area of national concern. Mr. NELSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentle(cid:173)man from New York (Mr. HAsTINGs) . Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yield ing me this time. Mr. Speaker, I join in very strong sup(cid:173)port for this legislation. I first intro(cid:173)duced this bill in 1973, and we did not consider it then, so I am delighted that the chairman of the subcommittee and the full committee saw fit this year to allow this measure to receive the careful attention that it did in the committee. Mr. Speaker, I am very much con(cid:173)cerned over the related deaths through methadone overdoses. We have been ac(cid:173)customed in this country to deaths through heroin overdoses, and so I be(cid:173)lieve the principal impact of this bill is that we are now trying to pay the at(cid:173)tention that is needed to the advances that have occurred through the utiliza(cid:173)tion of methadone in the legally au(cid:173)\u00b7thorized clinias in this country. The measure recognizes that methadone treatment is no longer a research project, but that we are now treating over 70,-000 addicts with methadone today. This measure goes a long way toward provid-ing the protection that is necessary to continue this very fine program. Mr. Speaker, I again tbank the gentle(cid:173)man from Minnesota for yielding me this time. Mr. PEYSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I believe that it serves a valuable purpose and urge its swift passage. However, I would like to clarify one point. It is essential that the definition of \"maintenance treatment\" in no way be construed to condone or permit the usage of heroin or morphine as treat(cid:173)ment drugs. It is my understanding that the bill is clear on this point, but I think that the intent of the House should be known. When we refer to narcotic drugs in the definition of \"maintenance treat(cid:173)ment\" we are not including heroin or morphine. In fact, if the rules permitted, I would offer an amendment to specifi(cid:173)cally exclude these two drugs from ever being dispensed in any drug mainte(cid:173)nance program in the country. I have a bill in right now to do that, and I hope that we can have hearings on it in the near future. As I said, though, I do support the pro(cid:173)visions of this bill. It is important that strict regulations be placed over the dis(cid:173)pensing of any maintenance or treat(cid:173)ment narcotic drug, and I urge swift passage of this bill. Mr. NELSEN. Mr. Speaker, I have C (cid:1) further requests for time. -Mr. STAGGERS. Mr. Speaker, in clos(cid:173)ing, I would like to commend the gen(cid:173)tleman from New York <Mr. HASTINGS) \u00b7for recognizing this problem and for sponsoring this bill. The gentleman is to be commended not only by the House of Representatives, but also by the coun(cid:173)try, for the energetic leadership the gentleman llas provided in this matter, as well as that of the distinguished gen(cid:173)'tleman from Kentucky, Dr. CARTER, and ali the other members of the subcommit(cid:173)tee. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The ques(cid:173)tion is on the motion offered by the gen(cid:173)tleman from West Virginia <Mr. STAG(cid:173)GERS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill H.R. 12503. \u00b7 The question was taken. Mr. BROWN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a qtiq.rum is not present, and make the .point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

            "204": "7260 EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS Marc~ 19; 1974 industry to reduce imports by 25 per cent. But let that pass; the main industrial use for copper is due to its high electrical con(cid:173)-ductivity. However, there are higher con-ductivities around: platinum, gold, silver. The reason why telephone lines are not made of gold is that there are other things than conductivity to consider, and when copper gets short, they will be made of alu(cid:173)minum (as done by many countries already), which is in plentiful supply for a long time. And when aluminum runs out? They will be made of glass fibers, because by that time \u00b7electrical communications will be carried by guided laser light. And glass will last for as long as there is sand in the deserts. And so it goes; the barrel has a very elusive bot(cid:173)tom. DEPLETION MYTH Depletion of resources is perhaps the most successful of the environmentalist scare(cid:173)crows, and the danger is that if this myth is accepted, it can eventually become true. If fossil fuels are regarded not as something to be explored and replaced, but as a sacro(cid:173)sanct last bottle of water in the desert, they may become just that; and instead of mov(cid:173)ing forward to cheap and abundant energy, we will live in a stunted economy draining its dwindling resources. This myth of the empty barrel is being constantly harped on by the ecocult. It forms the basis of a computer program fi(cid:173)nanced by the Club of Rome, which has in(cid:173)spired much awe among the gullible, though it is a pseudoscientific piece of unmitigated nonsense. It is based on false premises and shamelessly manipulated input data, but even so, it proves no more than that if you keep drinking from a finite bottle, the bottle will eventually be emptied. For such w:isdom, _ most people need neither a compt ter nor a MIT degree, but others ar_e awe when they hear the word \"computer.\" Now energy is always conserved, it can be converted, but not destroyed; in addition, the source of solar and nuclear energy are for all practical' purposes unlimited. That will not fit the theory of the empty barrel, so a new gimmick by the name of \"thermal pollution\" was thought up. This is little more than a fraud, but like all good frauds, it con(cid:173)tains a grain of truth. The Second Law of Thermodynamics does indeed amount to saying that in each energy conversion some small fraction must be ir(cid:173)retrievably converted to heat. The environ(cid:173)mentalists refer to this totally irrelevant law when they speak of nuclear and other power plants endangering aquatic life by using rivers to cool their condensers. Such argu(cid:173)mentation would put the well being of fish above that of people; but it is faulty beyond that. The heat involved raises the water tem(cid:173)perature only by a few degrees, possibly dis(cid:173)placing one species of aquatic life, but en(cid:173)abling another to find habitat--if indeed, it amounts to that much. When the British built a nuclear plant by the river Blackwater in Essex, there were the usual screams that the warm water would wipe out the oysters downstream. But it did no such thing; it did not even help the oysters when many of them died in the severe winter of 1962-3. But nature is not without irony. What the warm water in British estuaries did show was that sole, plaice and other fish will un(cid:173)dergo accelerated healthy growth, reaching maturity twice as fast, and an experimental fish farming station on the Isle of Man is now using \"thermal pollution\" (sans nuclear power plants) to breed healthy specimens faster. With their half-baked theories and self(cid:173)defeating cures, the environmentalists re(cid:173)cruited a following of impressive extent. They were amply helped by power-hungry rabble-rousers who rightly saw in environ(cid:173)mentalism a horse on which to crusade against business and the profit motive. They went almost totally unopposed, for who wanted to be accused of supporting pollu(cid:173)tion? Politicians no longer campaigned for justice and motherhood, but for ecology and the environment, and Congress, sensing this mood, passed emotion-swayed environmental legislation, some of which may well one day become a laughing stock of history. What all of this legislation has in com(cid:173)mon is that it puts the burden of proof on those who seek to change the status quo. Whoever intends to build a power plant, for example, must supply an environmental impact statement describing in detail all the possible and impossible effects on every(cid:173)thing from noise to disturbing the local veg(cid:173)etation, and this statement is then subjected to endless challenges. But no statement is re(cid:173)quired on the impact of failure to build the plant: How many women might die in child(cid:173)birth for lack of electric power? How many tons of food might rot in refrigerators dur(cid:173)ing blackouts and brownouts? How many working opportunities will, directly and in(cid:173)directly, fail to materialize? The negative standards are set, rather arbitrarily, by the Environmental Protection Agency; the posi(cid:173)tive standards are set by nobody. Among this environmental legislation, the 1970 Cle.an Air Act stands out as a major cripple; it will probably undergo drastic amendment before this year is out. It is technically unsound, its standards are based on erroneous data, and it is legally so nebu(cid:173)lous that its latest intel\u00b7pretation by the su(cid:173)preme Court will, in some parts of the coun(cid:173)try, make bad air worse while protecting air that does not need protection. In some in(cid:173)stances it actually guarantees greater health hazards as its standards are progressively enforced. AUTO EMIS!;)ION CONTROLS The auto emission standards are unsound from several points of view; but perhaps the most ludicrous is their uniform enforcement throughout the country. The idea of enforc(cid:173)ing the sam~ standard in Los Angeles as in the countryside of Montana is something like forcing everybody to wear sterilized r:ub(cid:173)ber gloves, no matter whether he is a sur(cid:173)geon or a stockbroker. Except that this glove idiocy would come cheaper: The total cost of the present pollution control will even(cid:173)tually come to $60 billion. And for that money the auto industry is forced to produce cars that guzzle ever more gasoline, have ever less power, and are about to be equipped with emission controls that may produce new health hazards. Yet $60 billion, according to a study at Texas A&M, is more than enough to build coal-to-methanol refineries meeting the pro(cid:173)jected gasoline demand for 1985; methanol pollutes less than gasoline, and its pollution can be more easily controlled-for the small fraction of cars driving in heavily polluted areas such as Los Angeles and other metro(cid:173)politan areas. The 1970 Clean Air Act is also a landmark in that Congress has legislated a technology that does not yet exist. The Senate has now followed up this idea by passing a bill or(cid:173)dering the auto industry not only to meet the as yet unaccomplished 1976 emission standards, but to bring the gas mileage up to 20 miles per gallon as wen. It has not yet legislated the production of cars running on fire-proof fuel. Though the Clean Air Act forced power plants to switch to low-sulfur coal, then to gas, then to oil, and caused cars to lose power while guzzling more gasoline, it would be wrong to present it as a major cause of the energy crisis, which was in the making long before 1970. A much larger share of the blame must go to the anti-technology sentiment fomented by the ecocult and to its legalistic guerrilla tactics against the Alaskan pipeline, nuclear power plants, refineries, oil drilling, and, in fact, any type of energy conversion or accessing facility. The \"suddenness\" of the energy crisis 1s what has been used as alleged proof that the crisis was contrived by the oil companies. In fact, there was nothing sudden about it. Fifteen years ago a presidential commis(cid:173)sion warned that demand would soon out(cid:173)pace supply unless countermeasures were taken, but the report was ignored, as were the increasingly .frequent and increasingly urgent warnings by experts in industry and the universities. The present Administration is now being berated for not having foreseen the crisis, and while it is true that it could have done more, it has a better record in this respect than all of its predecessors. By April 1973, it had progressed from general warnings to submitting 18 specific proposals to Congress, including reevaluation of the price controls on gas and oil. But Congress ignored the proposals; by March 1974 it had acted on only one of them (the Alaska pipe(cid:173)line bill), and that only a.fter the Arab oil embargo, wate\u00b7rgating away precious months. A look through the trade journals of the petroleum industry and of the electric utilities for the last few years will soon dispel any suspicions that the arrival of the energy crisis was sudden. The warnings from indus(cid:173)try (but not its PR departments) and from the universities were frequent and urgent. But nobody listened. There were other warnings, too. The long lines of cars now waiting their turn at the gas pumps in some metropolitan areas were commonplace in Denver, Colo., and Portland, Ore., in the summer of 1973. To say that the energy crisis erupted sud(cid:173)denly is like looking at a man who has fallen to his death from a skyscraper and saying \"How strange! The man was in perfectly good health when he fell past the fifth floor, and now all of a sudden he is dead.\" But, of course, energy production in the .United States is not dead, and that is another point that is overlooked in the \"why so sud(cid:173)den\" question placed at the door of the oil companies. Block-long lines at gas pumps do not start only when all the gas is gone; they ' start when the supply is down by as little as 10 percent. The cross-over point from enough to insufficient is indeed a \"sudden\" one. It so happened that the Arab embargo made that point appear dramatically in the fal~ of 1973; but without the embargo that point would have been reached a little later anyway. The present shortage is more serious than was foreseen by government spokesmen im(cid:173)mediately after the Arab embargo, when it was pointed out that direct imports of Arab crude amounted only to 5 percent of total U.S. consumption. When imports of refined products and other dislocations were con(cid:173)sidered, the forecast quickly rose to between 17 per cent and 21 per cent. Moreover, this represented only the immediate shortage for the present winter. The real crunch will very likely appear as a gasoline shortage in the spring of this year, since refineries were ordered to produce 15 to 20 per cent more heating oil at the expense of gasoline during the winter. The usual latitude for changes in the fraction of gasoline production is only 5 per cent, and this disruption may show up as an additional factor in the shortage. When demand goes up this spring and summer, a refinery capacity shortage of some two million bar(cid:173)rels per day (b/d) will probably show up as well. On the other hand, the embargo proved far less effective than anticipated, partly thanks to the oil companies who switched deliveries from non-Arab countries to Hol(cid:173)land and the United States and delivered Arab oil to \"Arab-friendly\" countries, often by radio message to tankers already bound for a different destination. More important, the considerable waste of energy, engendered by its artificial cheapness through price controls, will cushion the in(cid:173)creasing crunch as this waste is progressively eliminated. There is quite a way to go before ",

Sec(cid:173)tions 15 (Prohibited Acts) and 16 (Penal(cid:173)ties) of the act would be applica.ble to an employe-r who violated the requireme:-.ts of this section. A summary of the special cer(cid:173)tificates issued under this provision is re(cid:173)quired to be included in the Secretary's an(cid:173)nual report on the act. Section 24 also provides that the Secre(cid:173)tary may waive the minimum waze and overtime provisions of the act with respect to a student employed by his elementary or secondary school, where such employment constitutes an integral part of the regular education program provided by the school and is in accordance with applicable child labor laws. SEc. 25. Child Lab01\u00b7.-The employment of children under age 12 in agriculture is pro(cid:173)hibited unless they are employed on a farm owned or operated by their parents or guard(cid:173)ians, or on a farm exempt from the min(cid:173)imum wage provisions of the act. Children 12 or 13 years of age may work in agriculture only with the written consent of their par(cid:173)ents or guardians or if their parents or guardians are employed on the same farm. For persons 14 years of age or older, prior consent is not required for employment in agriculture. Any person who violates the child labor provisions of the act or applicable regula(cid:173)tions, is subject to civil penalties. The Sec(cid:173)retary is permitted to require employers to obtain employee's proof of age. SEc. 26. Suits by the Secretary.-Authorizes the Secretary to sue for back wages (which he can do now) but also to sue for an equal amount of liquidated damages without re(cid:173)quiring a written request from the employee. The Secretary could also sue even though the suit might involve issues of law that have not been finally settled by the courts. In the event the Secretary brings such an ac(cid:173)tion, the right of an employee provided by section 16(b) of the act to bring an action on behalf of himself, or to become party to such an action would terminate, unless such action is dismissed without prejudice, on motion by the Secretary. \u00b7SEc. 27. addition to and in furtherance of the re(cid:173)quirements of section 4(d) of the act, the Secretary is required to conduct studies on the justification or lack thereof for each of the exemptions provided by sections 13(a) and 13(b) of the act. Such studies shall in(cid:173)clude an examination of the extent to which employees of conglomerates receive the sec(cid:173)tions (13(a) and (b) exemptions and the economic effect of their inclusion in such exemptions. The report on the study would be due not later than January 1, 1976. Studies.-In Economic Effects SEc. 28. Nondiscrimination on Account of Age in Government Employment.-Extends the provisions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to an employer with 20 or more employees. Also extends the provisions of the act to State and local governments and their related agencies. States a policy of nondiscrimination on ac(cid:173)count of age in the Federal government, and authorizes the U.S. Civil Service Commission to enforce that policy. SEc. 29. Effective Date.-Provides that the effective date of the 1974 amendments shall be the first day of the second full month after the date of enactment. With respect to what we have done to the wage schedules, greater understand(cid:173)ing will probably be served by a compari(cid:173)son of the relevant provisions of last year's vetoed conference report, the sub(cid:173)sequently introduced Quie-Erlenborn bill <H.R. 10458), and the bill before us. For this purpose, we must assume that the conference report would have been en(cid:173)acted in September 1973-when vetoed(cid:173)the Quie-Erlenborn bill would have been enacted in September 1973-when intro(cid:173)duced-and this bill would have been en(cid:173)acted in January 1974-when introduced.

This legislation, unlike the vetoed bill, provides an exemption from the overtime provisions for public employees engaged in :fire protection or law enforcement ac(cid:173)tivities including security personnel in correctional institutions. We hav\u00b7e also modified the student em(cid:173)ployment provisions, to render them more accessible to employers willing to employ students under the requirements of the amendment. With respect to the student employ(cid:173)ment provisions, I would point out that the term \"employer\" is defined in the statute and was not chosen without be(cid:173)ing mindful of legislative intent. It does not appear in the revelant provisions of existing law, so the Secretary cannot be guided by past practice. We intend by the use of the term \"em(cid:173)ployer,\" that the Secretary look to the SEC. 21. Transit Employees.-Reduces and ultimately repeals the overtime e_xemption for any driver, operator, or conductor em(cid:173)ployed by an employer engaged in the busi(cid:173)ness of operating a street, suburban or inter(cid:173)urban electric railway, or local trolley or motor bus carrier. During the first year after the effective date of the 1974 amendments, overtime compensation must be paid to such employees for hours worked in excess of 48 per week; during the second year, for hours worked in excess of 44 per week; and there(cid:173)after, for hours worked in excess of 40 per week. In determining the hours of employ(cid:173)ment of such an employee, hours employed in charter activities shall not be included (1) the employee's employment in such ac(cid:173)tivities was pursuant to an agreement or understanding with his employer arrived at before engaging in such employment, and (2) if employment in such activities is not part of such employee's regular employment. SEc. 22. Cotton and Sugar Services Em(cid:173)ployees.-Retains a limited overtime exemp(cid:173)tion for certain employees engaged in cotton ginning and sugar processing activities. Over(cid:173)time compensation must be paid for employ(cid:173)ment in excess of 10 hours in any workday and 48 hours in any workweek for a period or periods not to exceed 14 workweeks in the aggregate in any calendar year. Without this section, the limited overtime exemption would be ultimately repealed by section 19. \u00b7 SEc. 23. Motion Picture Theaters, Logging Crews, and Oil Pipeline Transportation Em(cid:173)pZoyees.-Repeals the minimum wage exemp(cid:173)tion for employees of motion picture theaters, and logging employees, but retains the over(cid:173)time exemption for such employees. Also repeals the overtime exemption for em(cid:173)ployees of oil pipeline transportation com(cid:173)panies. SEc. 24. Employment of Students.-Pro(cid:173)vides for the employment of full-time stu(cid:173)dents (regardless of age but in compliance with applicable child labor laws) at wage rates less than those prescribed by the act in retail and service establishments, agricul(cid:173)ture, and institutions of higher education at which such students are enrolled. Students may be employed at a wage rate of not less than 85 per centum of the applicable mini(cid:173)mum wage rate or $1.60 an hour ($1.30 an hour in agriculture), whichever is the higher, pursuant to special certificates issued by the Secretary. Such special certificates shall pro(cid:173)vide that such students shall, except during vacation periods, be employed on a part-time basis (not to exceed 20 hours in any work(cid:173)week). In the case of an employer who in(cid:173)tends to employ five or more students under this section, the Secretary may not issue a special certificate unless he finds the em(cid:173)ployment of any such student \"will not cre(cid:173)ate a substantial probability of reducing the full-time employment opportunities\" of other workers. In the case of an employe!I' who intends to employ less than five students under this section, the Secretary may issue a special certificate if the employer certifies the Secretary that he is not thereby reducing the full-time employment opportunities of other works.

On the basis of $3.5 blllion accumulations at the end of 1972, the inter(cid:173)est benefit at 8 percent would be $280 million a year. On August 1, 1973, I made a major speech in this Chamber on aspects of corwrate taxation in the United States. In that speech, I analyzed some of the ways and means that utility companies were lowering their tax rates. I also de(cid:173)scribed-at great length-how very prof(cid:173)itable utilities, such as Con Edison, could be distributing their dividends to stock(cid:173)holders 100 percent tax free. Mr. Chairman, we all want cheap power. We all want energy costs to be as low as possible. But whart has happened in this coun(cid:173)try is that we have subsidized the devel(cid:173)opment of various forms of energy. We have subsidized oil production through the depletion allowance, the intangible drilling expense, and the foreign tax credit. We have been subsidizing the utility companies through these over(cid:173)lapping rapid depreciation tax gimmicks. The result is that energy has been cheap-and the result of cheap energy is that we have been careless. We have not designed efficient cars. We have built homes and buildings without ade(cid:173)quate insulation and with walls made of glass. The bill before the House today does not correct any of these problems. It per(cid:173)petuaJtes the status quo. But it is obvious from the tax data which I have developed and which the committee has furnished the House today, that we must undertake a com(cid:173)plete overhaul of our system of energy subsidies. Only as American business and American consumers began to pay the true cost of energy will we develop energy conservation as a national ethic. Only when we truly begin to save energy will we solve our energy crisis and obtain energy independence. Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. Mr. Chair(cid:173)man, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 11929. For the last year we have been en(cid:173)gaged in an important and historic ef(cid:173)fort to reform and rationalize the con(cid:173)gressional budget process. Yet this bill would institute still another back-door spending gimmick which would only further reduce the controllability of the annual budget. For the past 3 years we have strug(cid:173)gled mightily to keep the Federal budget from careening out of control and have helplessly watched the so-called fiscal dividend from economic growth being completely eaten up by the built-in mo(cid:173)mentum of Federal spending. This bill would only compound that problem by adding what amounts to another $100 \u00b7million per year to the deficit. In the early 1970's we embarked on a massive new effort to clean up the en(cid:173)vironment, and, more particularly, to in(cid:173)sure that the pollution costs of our high standard of living and sometimes extrav(cid:173)agant consumption habits are fully re(cid:173)fiected in the prices we pay for goods and services. Yet, this bill is based on the illusion that there is such a thing as a . \"free lunch\" and that by hiding poilu-tion control costs in the tax btll we can have a clean environment and cheap power too. During the last 6 months this Nation has had to come face to face with the un(cid:173)sustainability of our voracious appetites for energy, and with the consequent need to make major collective and individual efforts to conserve limited supplies of fuel. Nevertheless, this bill would reward overconsumption of energy rather than provide incentives for curtailing unnec(cid:173)essary use. During the last 2 years, our national political discourse, spurred by the Water(cid:173)gate tragedy and other events, has dwelt heavily on the need to clean up the governmental decisionmaking proc(cid:173)ess; to establish new national priorities; and to assert the broad public interest against the special interests, advantages, and protections that clutter the Federal budget, hover around the executive de(cid:173)partments, and dominate the Federal regulatory agencies. Yet this bill calls upon the general taxpayers of the Na(cid:173)tion to subsidize the electricity consump(cid:173)tion of a small segment of the population in one region of the country. Mr. Chairman, I am well aware of the principal argument made in behalf of this bill and must admit that it has a strong surface appeal. Since the TVA is a public nonprofit corporation, it may not avail itself to the various tax advan(cid:173)tages afforded priva\u00b7te investor-owned utilities. The pages of material included in the committee report on the dollar value of these tax benefits to various pri(cid:173)vate utilities would seem to make a good case for this bill. But before we become too mesmerized by all of these statistics and their im(cid:173)plied unfairness to TV A, let us recall a few cardinal facts: TV A does not pay Federal income taxes; TVA has no equity capital; TVA has no private investors or shareholders who must be paid a return on their investment. These obvious facts mean that TVA rates, prices, and revenues need not re(cid:173)flect a margin for profits to be paid to shareholders and for income taxes to be paid to the Federal Government. While I have some reservations about the wis(cid:173)dom of providing tax breaks even to private utilities, the important point is that these tax breaks do not lower actual capital costs by a single penny. The only thing they affect are tax liabilities, and to the extent that they lower tax lia(cid:173)bilities they marginally reduce the price and revenue levels needed to secure an adequate after-tax rate of return. Let me put this in concrete dollars and cents. In 1972 private utilities in the United States earned roughly $5.5 billion .in net profits. That amounts to roughly 39 cents per kilowatt-hour that TV A users do not have to pay be-cause by law TV A revenues are limited to the costs \u00b7of producing power. Were not the various accelerated de(cid:173)preciation and other tax breaks available to these private utilities they would have paid nearly $2.7 billion in Federal in(cid:173)come taxes on these profits as opposed to the $900 million they actually paid. These tax breaks, then, result in a tax savings of roughly 13 cents per kilowatt hour. In sum, private utility consumers buy 39 cents rather than 52 cents more per kilowatt hour than do TV A consumers due to the Federal pollution and other tax breaks available to private utilities. But the point is they still pay 39 cents more, all other things being equal. How it can be concluded from this that we need a compensating subsidy for the TVA system is difficult for me to fathom. Indeed, because of the proximity of fuel sources and lower costs generally in the TVA region, its consumers are already far better off than their counter(cid:173)parts in other areas of the country. Ac(cid:173)cording to the committee report, the av(cid:173)erage per kilowatt hour residential cost of electricity in the TV A system is 1.32 cents. Compare this to New York where the median cost is 3.18 cents, California where it is 2.08 cents, or the Northeast as a whole where it is 2.93 cents. In short, the combination of natural advantages in production costs, the lack of need to cover profit and dividend costs, and the exemption from Federal taxes mean that consumers in the TV A region get electric power nearly twice as cheaply as many other areas of the country. In light of this, should tax(cid:173)payers in New York, Illinois, or Cali(cid:173)fornia be called upon to lower these bar(cid:173)gain basement power rates even more? I think not, and urge that the House de(cid:173)feat this bill and repudiate the unsound reasoning that lies behind it. Mr. JONES of Alabama. Mr. Chair(cid:173)man, I have no further request for time. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will read.

Gas stations began closing, principally those operated by the cut-rate independents. Some major oil companies be(cid:173)gan cutting back sharply on their sales to the independent firms, explaining that the short(cid:173)age-resulting from decisions they had sup(cid:173)ported during the previous two years-had wiped out surplus supplies. Around the coun(cid:173)try, gasoline inventories were from 15 to 25 per cent below the. previous year. At that point, the Nixon administration set aside the \"national security\" arguments it had been using for years to keep imports low. Last April, the administration announced that it was finally abandoning the quota sys(cid:173)tem and allowing major increases in the amount of foreign oil allowed into the coun(cid:173)try. The new system was similar in prin(cid:173)ciple to what Nixon's task force had urged three years earlier. But now, one important thing had changed: Imported oil prices had risen to match domestic prices. So the for(cid:173)eign oil no longer threatened the industry's profits. But the move came too late. Inventories re(cid:173)mained short. As the summer wore on, more than 4,QOO gas stations closed for lack of supplies, and sales by many discount chains dropped as drastically as they had risen a few years before. By fall, motorists in some parts of the country, including Long Island, were searching hard to find a gas station open on Sunday. The age of the price war was over. The Arab embargo, announced in mid(cid:173)October, would produce even worse shortages, driving prices st111 higher and boosting prof(cid:173)its for the major oil companies. But statistics show that all those trends were well under way before the boycott. By last Oct. 12, according to industry fig(cid:173)ures, the country's inventories of crude oil, gasoline and fuel oils were all below the previous year's levels-at a time when the average demand for petroleum products was up more than eight per cent. In that same month, the Interior Department predicted before the boycott that heating-oil shortages in the coming winter probably would range from four to 10 per cent, depending on weather. Major oil company profits also began soar(cid:173)ing well before the boycott. During the first nine months of last year, the profits of the top 16 oil companies went up an average of 44 per cent over the same period in the pre(cid:173)vious year. The biggest increases were scored by Amerada Hess, 88 per cent; Gulf, 60 per cent; and Exxon, 59 per cent. Those profits reflected the rising prices of both foreign and domestic crude oil. And it was administration actions that set those increases in motion before the Arab oil em(cid:173)bargo. The shortages had given major oil com(cid:173)panies exactly what they wanted-higher prices. And the cost fell exactly where State Department official Frank Mau had advised a year earlier; directly on the consumer. MEMOS WARNED PRESIDENT OF AIDE'S BUSINESS TIES A White House official privately urged Pres(cid:173)ident Nixon in 1970 to restrict presidential assistant Peter M. Flanigan's influential role in government decisions involving big busi(cid:173)ness because of \"possible conflicts of inter(cid:173)est\" in Flanigan's extensive financial holdings. Nixon, however, did not follow, the recom(cid:173)n:endations made in confidential memos from then-special counsel Clark Mollenhoff, a lawyer and Pulitzer Prize winning investi(cid:173)gative reporter whose White House duties in(cid:173)cluded trying to spot potential administra(cid:173)tion scandals before they became public. As a result, Flanigan remains one of Nixon's As most powerful aides, and he still plays an im(cid:173)portant part in shaping government poli(cid:173)cies-particularly oil policies-that affect the interests of the nation's largest corporations. The previously unpubliclzed dispute with(cid:173)in the White House came to light during a Newsday investigation of oil decisions dur(cid:173)ing the Nixon years. In interviews, contra(cid:173)dictory versions of the incident were given by Flanigan, who denied any potential con(cid:173)flicts in his holding, and Mollenhoff, who has left the administration and returned to news(cid:173)paper reporting. They agreed, however, that the controversy began over Flangian's finan(cid:173)cial connections with an oil tanker company. Flanigan came to the White House in 1969 from a Wall Street investment banking firm, D1llon, Read & Co. Inc. Among the firm's oil industry clients is Union Oil Co. of Cali(cid:173)fornia. While Flanigan was still a. D1llon Read vice president, he also served as president and a stockholder of a. company called Barra(cid:173)cuda Tanker Corp. Dillon Read had set up the company solely to lease tankers to Union Oil. When he was named to his White House post, Flanigan said, he sold his interest in Dillon Read to others in the firm, resigned as president of Barracuda., and put the rest of his personal stock holdings, including 308 shares in Barracuda, into a \"blind trust.\" In such trusts, an administrator takes over the management of the stock owner's portfolio. long as the arrangement exists, the ad(cid:173)ministrator is not supposed to tell the owner anything about sales or purchases of stock by the trust. For his administrator, Flanigan chose his father, Horace C. Flanigan, a former board chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Trust and a former Union Oil director. That was where matters stood on March 9, 1970, when then-Sen. Joseph D. Tydings (D(cid:173)Md.) took the Senate floor and gave the first in a series of speeches on the case of a tanker called the Sansinena, owned by Bar(cid:173)racuda and leased to Union. The Sansinena had been operating under a foreign flag and, thus, was barred from carrying oil between U.S. ports. But on March 2, 1970, Tydings revealed, the Treasury De(cid:173)partment had granted a special waiver allow(cid:173)ing the ship to do so. Only a. few days be(cid:173)fore, Flanigan's stock in Barracuda had been sold to others in the tanker venture for about $20,000. The waiver made the ship more valuable, Tydings said, charging that \"by the stroke of a pen\" the government had \"created a multimillion dollar windfall.'' That was when the Fla.nigan-Mollenhoff dispute began. According to Flanigan's ver(cid:173)sion, Mollenhoff acted impulsively. Without speaking to Flanigan or investigating the situation independently, Mollenhoff \"fired off a memo\" to Nixon saying Flanigan should be fired, the White House aide said. After that, Flanigan said, he called Mollenhoff to his office and they discussed the tanker mat(cid:173)ter, Flanigan said that his explanation left Mollenhoff convinced that Flanigan had done nothing wrong. Newsday has obtained a copy of the memo Mollenhoff sent to Nixon on March 10, the day after Tydings' first speech. The memo did not say that Flanigan should be fired. Nor did it mention the tanker. Rather, it noted Flanigan's broad powers within the adminis(cid:173)tration, mentioned \"possible conflicts of in(cid:173)terest,\" and said: \"This problem is particu(cid:173)larly difficult when it involves someone with large financial holdings who is from a family and from a business firm that has such ex(cid:173)tensive investments.\" The memo said re(cid:173)porters had raised questions about Flani(cid:173)gan's oil-policy role and suggested that Nixon should \"see if there isn't some different al(cid:173)location of [Flanigan's) duties that would eliminate some of the potential problems.'' Mollenhoff said in an interview that Flani(cid:173)gan, during their meeting, had shown him a partial list of his financial holdings. They included, he said, a substantial amount of stock in Anheuser-Busch Inc. Mollenhoff said he was disturbed by that, since one of Flani(cid:173)gan's White House jobs was overseeing agen(cid:173)cies like the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates activities of companies, such as Anheuser-Busch, engaged in interstate commerce. Molenhoff said he continued sending sim(cid:173)ilar memos to Nixon through the spring of 1970, but without results. Meanwhile, the tanker controversy also continued. The Treas(cid:173)ury Department promptly revoked the special waiver, and Flanigan shifted control over the trust from his father to an official of Manufacturers Hanover Trust. He and his father had never discussed his trust holdings, Flanigan said. He said he chose a new ad(cid:173)ministrator only to avoid further congres(cid:173)sional criticism. Flanigan also issued a state(cid:173)ment at the time saying he had never dis(cid:173)cussed the waiver application \"with any gov(cid:173)ernment official or employe.\" Six weeks later, however, Tydings released an internal government memo showing that Flanigan had asked Federal Maritime Ad(cid:173)ministrator Andrew Gibson the previous Oc(cid:173)tober about why the tanker was barred from domestic shipping. Asked about that in an interview, Flanigan said the inquiry was merely a casual one and did not represent an attempt to influence the waiver matter. Mollenhoff said that he sent his final memo about Flanigan to Nixon on May 6, 1970, saying: \"It would appear to me that it is virtually impossible for Peter Flanigan to isolate himself from his stock interests with(cid:173)out a full divestiture. Since Flanigan con(cid:173)siders the sale of the stock out of the ques(cid:173)tion, the only manner in which possible con(cid:173)flicts can be avoided is through some clearly worked out restriction on his duties ... \" The following month, Mollenhoff resigned his White House post and went back to the Washington bureau of the Des Moines Reg(cid:173)ister and Tribune. Viewers of Nixon's tele(cid:173)vised press conference last Oct. 26 may recall Mollenhoff as the scowling, six-foot-four re(cid:173)porter who shouted, \"Mr. President, Mr. President!\" so insistently that Nixon finally recognized him by saying, \"You're so loud, I have to take you.\" \"You happen to dodge all my questions,\" Mollenhoff replied. Nixon laughted. ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR PERSONAL EXEMPTION Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, yester(cid:173)day I introduced a bill which would in(cid:173)crease the personal exemption on Federal income tax returns from $750 to $1,000. This is a proposal which I first made in January 1961; I believe that it is all the more necessary today. The likely course of the economy will be a downturn in 1974. My legislation would help cushion recession and speed recovery with only minor effects on the course of inflation this year. Economic activity already sags. In(cid:173)dustrial production has declined during the past 3 consecutive months; unem(cid:173)ployment has risen by 650,000 persons since October 1973; and real GNP is declining sharply this quarter. What has happened is that a normal economic cooloft' which began last summer and autumn collided with the energy crisis and the slowdown turned into a tail(cid:173)spin. ",

And nothing in that reply denies that the Federal Reserve System had the power to prevent the sharp accelera(cid:173)tion in monetary growth. I recognize, of course, that there are now, and have been in the past, strong political pressures on the Fed to continue rapid mone(cid:173)tary growth. Once inflation has proceeded as far as it already has, it will, as the reply says, take some time to eliminate it. More(cid:173)over, there is literally no way to end inflation that will not involve a temporary, though perhaps fairly protracted, period of low eco(cid:173)nomic growth and relatively high unemploy(cid:173)ment. Avoidance of the earlier excessive monetary growth would have had far less costly consequences for the community than cutting monetary growth down to an appro(cid:173)priate level will now have. But the damage has been done. The longer we wait, the harder it will be. And there is no other way to stop inflation. The only justification for the Fed's vaunted independence is to enable it to take measures that are wise for the long-run even if not popular in the short-run. That is why it is so discouraging to have the reply consist almost entirely of a denial of responsibility for inflation and an attempt to place the blame elsewhere. If the Fed does not explain to the public the nature of our problem and the costs in(cid:173)volved in ending inflation; if it does not take the lead in imposing the temporarily unpopular measure required, who will? THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ON RELIEVING THE BURDEN OF SEC(cid:173)OND-CLASS POSTAL RATES -Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, some of the most obvious symptoms of our sick economy are the soaring\u00b7 postal rates now being in:flicted on the American public. The 10-cent stamp is bad enough for the average citizens, but few are aware of the even more serious burden that astro(cid:173)nomical rate increases are now imposing on what is perhaps the most valuable source of ideas in our free society, the Nation's newspapers and magazines. Today's Wall Street Journal contains an excellent discussion of this issue by Mr. Stephen Grover. As Mr. Grover notes, publications are taking a number of imaginative steps to try to alleviate the burden, but many believe that the real remedy lies with Congress. To provide the sort of relief that is urgently needed, Senator BARRY GoLD(cid:173)WATER and I have joined in introducing legislation that is now before the Senate and that will soon be considered by the Committee on Post Office and Civil Serv(cid:173)ice. My hope is that the Senate will be able to act on this measure as soon as possible. Only through prompt action to relieve the burden of rising postal rates can we commute what is, in effect, a death sentence for many of the Nation's most valuable publications. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con(cid:173)sent that the article from the Wall Street Journal may be printed in the RECORD, as well as an article I prepared on the sub(cid:173)ject for the current issue of Signature magazine. There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 20, 1974] EMBATl'LED FOURTH ESTATE: IN THROES OF POSTAGE HIKES, PUBLISHERS SHRINK PROD \u2022 UCT, HIKE PRICES, CRY DOOM (By Stephen Grover) To hear many of the nation's magazine and newspaper publishers talk, the Postal Re(cid:173)organization Act of 1970 is this generation's equivalent of the pre-Revolutionary War's sugar and stamp acts. \"A heavy blow\" is how the usually optimistic Reader's Digest maga(cid:173)zine referred to the postal act in its January issue, adding that the congressional move \"makes our future-and that of many other magazines-uncertain.\" \"There is no doubt whatever,\" the Digest's editors continued, \"that the rate rise will force a large number of magazines to stop publishing,\" Rates, of course, are at the heart of the postal act. Besides setting up the present U.S. Postal Service as a semi-independent body with more autonomy than the old Post Office had ever enjoyed, Congress directed its new creation to see that all classes of mail were made to pay their own way. And as far as second-class mail was concerned, this con(cid:173)gressional direction was a radical departure from times past. American tradition, said his(cid:173)torian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in a recent arti(cid:173)cle in this newspaper, has been \"in transit second-class mail at cheap rates because the circulation of newspapers and magazines has been deemed essential to the enlightenment of the Republic and to the strengthening of American democracy.\" The result of the Postal Reorganization Act will be that postal rates for most publi(cid:173)cations will be at least 242% higher by 1976 than they were in 1971. The effects of the increases, which are taking place in steps over a five-year period, are already obvious. Such magazines as Esquire, Ladies' Home Journal and Fortune and such newspapers as The Wall Street Journal have trimmed their size as one means of shaving their postal bills. Some periodicals have also started to print on lighter-weight grades of paper, and many publications have raised prices. Some, like the Journal have taken all three steps. GRIM VIEW Now, many publications say they can do no more. Prices are about as high as they can go without a drastic loss of readership. Still lighter grades of paper, even 1f they were avilable, would cost far more than the postal savings that they would effect. And further dimensional shrinkage would in most cases be unfeasible. The upshot: Many publica(cid:173)tions are taking the same grim view as Read(cid:173)er's Digest and assert that unless postal rates are trimmed, or unless they're spaced out over a 10-year period instead of the current five(cid:173)year schedule, they will have to fold. The malaise at the Digest, whose U.S. cir(cid:173)culation of 18.4 million makes it the most popular American magazine in existence, is caused by the fact that 90% of its circula(cid:173)tion is sent to subscribers via second-class mall; consequently, the publication faces a rise in its second-class postage bill from $7 million this year to $16 Inillion two years hence. Significant as this magnitude is, the Digest is far from alone. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and The National Observer, expects its second-class postage bill to rise this year alone to $13.7 million, up from $8.7 million last year (the Dow Jones increase is largely accounted for by the Journal, 80% of whose 1.4-million cir(cid:173)culation is subscription). Time Inc., whose Time, Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated magazines all depend heavily on mail dellv(cid:173)ery, expects its second-class postage blll wm rise by $4.5 million this year to $14.4 million. Newsweek magazine expects its second-class postage expenditures to amount to $5.7 mil(cid:173)lion in 1974, a 54% jump over last year(cid:173)\"and that's assuming that the volume of sec(cid:173)ond-class postage remains about the same as it was last year,\" says Gibson McCabe, presi(cid:173)dent of Newsweek, a Washington Post Co. publication. NOWHERE TO TURN Dire as the predicament of these publica(cid:173)tions may be, certain of their sisters in the field may fare even worse. For example, a number of the nation's smaller technical journals and magazines of opinion, unlike such mass-circulation publications as Time and Newsweek, are almost entirely dependent on revenues from circulation, rather than ad(cid:173)vertising, and therefore can't turn to in(cid:173)creased advertising rates to meet higher post(cid:173)age bills. One such magazine is The Nation, nearly all of whose 30,000 circulation is subscrip(cid:173)tion. The Nation has few advertisers. \"Con(cid:173)sequently,\" says its publisher, James J. Stor(cid:173)row Jr., \"any increase in costs must be borne almost entirely by our readers.\" The publica(cid:173)tion has already raised its rates to $15 a year (for 48 issues) from $12.50 in 1971, the year the first step of the new postal increases went into effect, and the magazine is fearful that any further increases will lead to a loss of readers. \"We already pay 25% to 30% more for post(cid:173)age than for paper, and postal rates are going up faster than any other item,\" Mr. Storrow says. The periodicals with sparse advertising argue tha-t ad-heavy publications brought about the current postal situation. Tradition(cid:173)ally, major consumer publications have taken advantage of low subscription rates and even cheaper second-class postal rates to flood the nation with their production and then raise their ad rates on the basis of huge subscription lists. In fact, this factor was a significant motivation for Congress to pass the Postal Reorganization Act; and \u00b7 today U.S. Postmaster General Elmer T. Klassen stands by that decision. \"I find it difficult to think these publications deserve any form of subsidy,\" he says. \"CATCH 22\" LOGIC is \"If Mr. Klassen quickly adds, \"We're not trying to destroy anyone. These magazines are our customers.\" Nevertheless, Arthur Keylor, Time Inc.'s group vice president in charge of magazines, skeptical about Washington's benevolence. the Postal Service were to find the volume of mall de(cid:173)clining as a result of the increases, it would find a way to jack up the rates still more. And then where would we be? The whole business has a 'Catch 22' logic to it.\" While some of the smaller and middle(cid:173)sized publications are more or less resigned to the postal-rate increases-\"There isn't much that we can do about them,\" says Russell Bernard, publisher of Harper's mag(cid:173)azine-the larger publications are moving to confront the problem on a number of fronts. Coleman W. Hoyt, distribution manager of Reader's Digest, says his magazine has de(cid:173)veloped a delivery system based on the ser(cid:173)vices of a private carrier that it will try out in several communities this summer in con(cid:173)junction with McCall's and several other major magazines. According to Mr. Hoyt, the Digest sys(cid:173)tem sorts the magazines not only by partic(cid:173)ular areas within a community but by exact carrier routes as well. \"We're even planning to sequence the walk of that carrier,\" he says, \"so he doesn't have to do any sorting himself while on the route.'' The Wall Street Journal already does its own delivering in towntown areas of New ",

But I do not think the Senate should attempt here, today, to impose its will on a single, standing committee of the Senate. I do not know who will make up the member(cid:173)ship of that committee i: the legislation passes. I do not intend to serve on it. I would not serve on it if I were asked to serve on it. I have. all the work I can do, and more. But I believe that Senators who may be on that committee should have the right to determine for them(cid:173)selves the rules that that committee shall follow, just as every other standing committee of the Senate has the pre(cid:173)rogative of ~naking such determination. The Committee on Foreign Relations often must consider very sensitive mat(cid:173)ters, matters that go to the heart of the national security. The Committee on Appropriations of the Senate often must consider, in exec(cid:173)utive session, highly classified matters that go to the national security of Amer(cid:173)ica. The Committee on Armed Services often finds it necessary to consider in ex(cid:173)ecutive session extremely sensitive and delicate matte~s. The Budget Committee, if it is created by this legislation, is going to cut across all of these subject areas. It is going to have to consider in executive session, if it is to protect the interests of the coun(cid:173)try, classified material that would be also within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee, the Committee on Appropriations, or the Committee on Foreign Relations. Why should Senators single out one standing committee and say, \"'You are not equal to the other standing commit(cid:173)tees\"? The Budget Committee should have the prerogative to determine for it(cid:173)self what it shall do. But we would be saying, in effect, that we are not going to let it do that. We would be saying, \"The Senate is going to impose upon you a mandate that, with respect to sensitive, classified information which your com(cid:173)mittee members may feel ought to be considered in executive session, you will not be able to consider in executive ses(cid:173)sion until such time as a majority of your committee votes to close the ses(cid:173)sion.\" I do not believe that is right. If we are going to impose that mandate on the Budget Committee, then let us re(cid:173)consider Senate Resolution 69 in another form or under a new number, and let the Senate impose the same mandate upon all the standing committees of the Sen(cid:173)ate. Let us not single out one commit(cid:173)tee--the Budget Committee--and say that it will be bound by this rule which the Senate lays down today by this amendment, while the other 17 standing committees may each decide for them(cid:173)selves under rule XXV, paragraph 7 (b), what procedure they will follow. I am for sunshine where there ought to be sunshine. For example, I am for having selected debates of the Senate on television. I have submitted a resolution that has been referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration for a study of such a matter. I think it is an idea whose time has come, as the late Senator Dirksen used to say. I think that one of the the things that is wrong with the country its standing rules last year. If the Senate today is that the President, whether he wants to make a change in a rule, let us be Democrat or Republican, can com-do it head on, not chip it away, which mand, at the snap of his fingers, literally this amendment would have the effect of -speaking, all the television networks, doing. all the radio broadcasting networks, and Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, will all the press media to carry an instant Senator yield? messages to the people anytime he Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I yield. wishes. He can put his case before the Mr. PERCY.

Men l>l.ke Clay and Calhoun, Webster and Seward, Sherman and Bryan sat in presiden(cid:173)tial cabinets because they had independent power bases that demanded, or deserved, recognition. And cabinets were used as con(cid:173)sultative bodies. Presidents could still ignore or overrule them, of course. Lincoln could say, \"Seven noes and one aye; the ayes have it.\" But at least he asked for his Cabinet's opinion, and he took a vote. Now, all this has changed. Replacing the Cabinet as the President's consultative group has been a presidential-level staff composed of appointees who have no outside power bases and hence no independence. This staff formUlates policy for the President, issues orders on his behalf, and supervises and co(cid:173)ordinates their execution. It has enabled the President to assume command, of the exec(cid:173)utive branch in a sense that is truly military. As in an army, so in the executive branch it is now the headquarters staff that decides; the cabinet officers, reduced to the status of field commanders, execute. In the old days, the President had to rely on his Cabinet; its members were all he had to run the government with. Now, with his modern mana!;ement apparatus, the Presi(cid:173)dent need no longer talk with them. Nor has he time. No President since Eisenhower has used the Cabinet even a~ a consultative body. It meets pro forma, 1f at all, as a convenient way for the President to give pep talks and issue instructions. With the Cabinet's de(cid:173)cline in status has come an inevitable change in the character of its members. The nine(cid:173)teenth-century tradition that the President appoint strong political leaders with inde(cid:173)pendent power bases has withered away-a trend that has reached a kind of culmination in the present administration. The last thing an ambitious presidential staff wants is department heads with inde(cid:173)pendent power bases. Such men have the strength to be defiant and cause trouble. What such a White House staff wants is, in the words of one former Nixon aide, men \"'who will, when the White House orders them to jump, only ask 'how high?' \" To make doubly sure that department heads would be compliant, the White House has systemati(cid:173)cally placed in subcabinet positions, as under secretaries or in lesser posts, trusted political and White Houe aides. But the flow of power from the depart(cid:173)ments to the presidency, like the shift in the congressional-presidential balance, has not been the product of pure w111fUlness. Here, too, the trend has had a basis in the realities of modern government. The executive branch does need central direction and coordina(cid:173)tion; it cannot be treated as a cluster of in(cid:173)dependent satrapies, each responsive only to its clientele. There must be a coordinated budget. Departments do have to respond to common policies established by officials re(cid:173)sponsible to the people through elective processes-and the only such official in the executive branch is the President. These needs, too, are affected by the greater com(cid:173)plexity, the faster tempo, and the closer inter(cid:173)relationship among governmental activities. In domestic fields, as in war and diplomacy, the government must be able to marshal its resources and act decisively and consistently whether the battle is against inflation or pollution, a recession or an energy shortage. The answer to the problem of misused presidential power is not to try to disperse the essential components of that power among semi-independent agencies within the executive branch. That would only reintro(cid:173)duce the problems of conflict and adminis(cid:173)trative weakness that compelled the central(cid:173)ization of power in the first place. Besides EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS being unwise, such an approach would be essentially unenforceable. The Congress could probably find ways, through its appro(cid:173)priation power, to reduce somewhat the size of the White House and Executive Office staffs, but the Congress has shown no wish to interfere with a President's way of doing business to the point of trying to dismantle the presidential office. Short of such a step, there is no way to enforce a new set of Presi(cid:173)dent-Cabinet relations. A President can hardly be compelled to appoint strong and independent political figures to the Cabinet and to repose power in them if he prefers to rely on White House aides. The organization of the executive branch is, by its nature, an executive function. DID THE FOUNDING FATHERS ERR? too in one man. If the power of the presidency cannot be reduced very much-and if, in a fast-moving and complex world, it probably should not be-then how does one solve the basic prob(cid:173)lem of too much power in one man? I suggest that most current analysis of the problem has been misdirected because it concentrates on the first three words of that phrase: much power. I submit that the solution is to be found by looking instead at the last three words: An institutional principle applied almost universally in the English-speaking world is that major decisions should be made not by one man acting alone, but by a collective body of some kind. In the United States, legislatures are all plural bodies. So are juries, the higher courts, and the regulatory com(cid:173)missions. Corporations and voluntary service organizations, school systems and univer(cid:173)sities are run by plural boards of directors who select and supervise the managers. In political parties the ultimate authority lies in conventions and committees. The one great exception to this principle is the executive branch of the United States government (along with the executive branches of the state governments and some city govern(cid:173)ments that are patterned after it). In other English-speaking countries, even such exceptions do not exist. Executive power rests in plural cabinets, as it does in most non-English-speaking democracies as well. Even in the nondemocracies, power is often lodged at least formally in plural bodies such as the Politburo in the Soviet Union. This pattern is not accidental. Rather, it embodies a wisdom that has evolved over centuries of experience with human orga(cid:173)nization. Societies have learned again and again that to entrust power to one man is inherently dangerous. He may be erratic or impulsive or obsessive in his judgments, or arbitrary and unfair. He may be incompetent, a bungler. He may be la.zy, negligent, or cor(cid:173)rupt. He may pervert the ends of the orga(cid:173)nization for his own benefit, whether to gain money or punish enemies or reward friends, or simply to perpetuate himself and his fol(cid:173)lowers in office. Hence, in almost every or(cid:173)ganization the restraint of collective de(cid:173)cision-making is forced upon the leader. He is made subordinate to, or required to act as a member of, a plural body of some kind. It may be called by many names-commis(cid:173)sion, council, board, committee, senate, house, cabinet-but its members have a de(cid:173)gree of independence of the leader. Plural decision-making has its own draw(cid:173)backs, obviously. It can cause delay, undue caution, and resistance to innovation. Those who seek spectacular progressivism are more likely to find it in presidents and governors than in congresses and legislatures, for the single leader can march without having to be in lockstep with anyone. But the experi(cid:173)ence of centuries has weighed the disadvan(cid:173)tage against the merits and given its verdict-(cid:173)that the plural body, not the single leader, March 20, 1974 is better to be trusted. When a single execu(cid:173)tive is needed to dispatch the execution of a collective body's policy, he is made respon(cid:173)sible to and is supervised by that body. Never is he left free to act unchecked, responsible only to the general membership of the or(cid:173)ganization and to himself. If this be the folk wisdom, one must pon(cid:173)der how the Founding Fathers came to stray so far. They were sensitive to the danger of concentrating power in any institution, but in their day it was the prospect of too much power in the legislature that concerned them most. They feared that in a republic, the majority of the legislature would get out of hand and threaten the rights of the minor(cid:173)ity-and their fear seemed borne out by the experience of the states in the decade before the Constitutional Convention. As men of property, they feared the mob, the levelers. So the question was whether the President would be strong enough. Nevertheless, the vote for a one-man presidency was not unan(cid:173)imous. The Convention debated whether the head of the executive branch should be one man or three; seven states preferred the single executive, three states the plural. Had the Founders foreseen how the system of presidential election they designed would change-how the power of selection would pass from a judicious electoral college made up of leading citizens to a popular process resting largely on the vote of citizens in pri(cid:173)mary and general elections--one can wonder what the vote on a plural presidency would have been. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION Could the presidency be pluralized? No proposal to scrap the institution and begin anew could be seriously considered. What is needed is a remedy that could be grafted onto the existing system with the least pos(cid:173)sible disruption of its basic structure. The simplest device that might serve to introduce an element of collective judgment into the exercise of executive power may be the one by which the executive in a parlia(cid:173)mentary system is controlled. That is the device of dismissal of a government through a parliamentary vote of \"no confidence,\" which could be added to the American sys(cid:173)tem by a simple constitutional amendment. This provision would have both a direct and an indirect effect. The direct effect would be to make possible the removal of a Presi(cid:173)dent who, though not guilty of the provable \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" that are the basis for impeachment, has lost the capacity to lead and inspire and unify the country(cid:173)in short, the capacity to govern. On more than one occasion in the past, a President whose effectiveness had been destroyed through incompetence, gross negligence, egregious errors in foreign or domestic policy, or crimes and misdemeanors committed by those who had intimately shared his confi(cid:173)dence and acted in his name, has remained in office until the end of his allotted four years-and nothing could be done about it. No other democratic government leaves itself so vulnerable. If the \"no confidence\" procedure were in(cid:173)troduced into our Constitution, a President to keep his office would have to do more than keep himself free of indictable crime. He would have to satisfy the Congress-and therefore the people, for the Congress would hardy act in such a matter in defiance of the people-with his conduct of the govern(cid:173)ment. And what could be more consistent with democratic theory than that? The probability, of course, is that the power to vote \"no confidence,\" like the power to impeach, would be rarely used. Conse(cid:173)quently the indirect effect would be more important. Though by no means wholly pre(cid:173)dictable, the indirect effect would probably ",

Under a previous order of the House, the gentle(cid:173)man from Montana <Mr. MELCHER) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MELCHER. Mr. Speaker, when the President replied to questions on beef prices by the broadcasters Tuesday eve(cid:173)ning, I had hoped he would take the questions concerning beef prices asked by the broadcasters. I had hoped that he would establish a policy of this adminis(cid:173)tration within the Department of Agri(cid:173)culture and other Federal agencies to find out why consumers have been paying high prices for beef in the stores while producers are taking drastically lower prices for their cattle. Last summer cat(cid:173).tle prices touched $60 per hundred, broke sharply recently, and are near the $40 mark which is about a 30-percent drop. Consumers should be benefiting from the lower prices while cattle feeders are sustaining huge losses of $100 per head, mostly because of higher feed and other operating costs. The President's reply to one of the questions was that farmers are having it pretty good, but anybody in the cattle feeding business would vigorously dis(cid:173)pute that statement. They know better and so should President Nixon. He should examine the information that is avail(cid:173)able in the Department of Agriculture's \"Livestock and Meat Situation\" for Feb(cid:173)ruary of this year which indicates that the cost and expense of feeding a 1,050-pound steer comes to $556.88. To cover this cost it requires a sale price of $53.04 per hundredweight just to break even. Since the market is about $10 lower than that, that amounts to a loss of over $100 per head. Feedlot operators are not having it good. No way. On the contrary, the losses are so substantial as to create a concern among many of us that many feedlot operators will either be forced out of business or put so low in the hole that they cannot restock their feedlots. That would mean less beef available in the last half of this year and the first quarter of 1975, and if consumers think prices are tough now, look out for a period of scarcity when there would be a real excuse to raise the price at the supermarket meat counters. Consumers simply have not received the lower beef prices that they are en(cid:173)titled to considering the drop in cattle prices. In August when cattle were reach(cid:173)ing close to the $60 figure, the retail price as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics read like this: Round steak, $1.88; hamburger, $1.03, and rump roast, $1.60. The latest comparable figures available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics are for February when we find round steak, $1.93; hamburger, $1.10, and rump roast, $1.87. Cattle are much ches.per than they were in August, yet the statistics show in February con(cid:173)sumers not only did not get the break they should have in price reductions, but were actually paying more for the same items than they did last August. So the cattle feeders are having it bad, not good, and the consumers are having it bad, too, despite the fact that there has been a 30-percent drop from the high point in cattle prices last summer. The Subcommittee on Domestic Marketing and Consumer Relations will hold public hearings on April 2, 3, and 4 to investigate this paradox of low cattle prices with high retail prices and why. Even the calling of these hearings may result in retail price drops. It is high time they do come down to reflect the lower cattle prices.

CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT OF 1974 The Senate continued with the con(cid:173)sideration of the bill (S. 1541) to provide for the reform of congressional proce(cid:173)dures with respect to the enactment of fiscal measures; to provide ceilings on Federal expenditures and the national debt; to create a budget committee in each House; to create a congressional office of the budget, and for other purposes. Mr. SCHWEIKER. Mr. President, some people seem to think Federal spending is about like death and taxes; nobody likes it, but not much can be done about it. I reject that. Not only can we do some(cid:173)thing about Federal spending, but if we are going to preserve the economic vitality of the United States, we must do something about it. Federal spending sets the pace for the rest of our econ(cid:173)omy-and as long as Federal spending is out of control, our galloping inflation is going to continue out of control. We simply cannot afford this any longer. During the first session of the 93d Congress, I introduced S. 1213, the Fed(cid:173)eral Spending Control Act of 1973. I am pleased that the legislation before us today, S. 1541, has adopted the basic features of my bill: A strict Federal spending ceiling, tight controls on back(cid:173)door spending, and creation of a con(cid:173)gressional budget committee to impose businesslike discipline over the entire Federal spending process. Back in 1972, I joined a majority of my colleagues in both houses in fighting for a $250 billion budget ceiling-and such a ceiling finally passed both Houses of Congress after a bitter fight. But it was never enacted into law, because the President and the Congress could not agree on where the cuts would be made. Last year, when I introduced S. 1213, I favored a spending ceiling substantially less than the President's proposed budget request for that year. So the issue is not between the spenders in Congress and the savers in the executive branch. Mr. President, the issue is a battle of prior(cid:173)ities, a debate over how the same amount of our tax dollars should be spent. I be(cid:173)lieve our constitutional form of Gov(cid:173)ernment requires that the representa(cid:173)tives of the people, in the House and the Senate, make these crucial decisions. S. 1541 will finally give us the machinery to do that, and I strongly support this measure. In closing, let me stress that S. 1541 is only a first step. Reform of the Fed(cid:173)eral spending process must be coupled with reform of the Federal taxing process. It is high time we end the special interest tax breaks, the \"golden gim(cid:173)mick\" which has encouraged the major oil companies to raise world oil prices by giving them a dollar for dollar tax credit against U.S. income tax for for(cid:173)eign royalties paid, and the regressive taxes imposed on our poor and elderly. S. 1541 is a strong first step, but I in(cid:173)tend to continue fighting for compre(cid:173)hensive tax reform, this session. Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask that it be stated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. amendment will be stated. The legislative clerk proceeded to read the amendment. Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the further reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment ordered to be printed in the RECORD is as follows: The On page 129, line 16, strike out \"401(c)\" and insert in lieu thereof \"401(c) (2) (A) and (B)\". On page 129, strike out lines 17 through 19 and insert in lieu thereof the following: \"(2) with respect to any matter referred to in section 401 (d);\". On page 149, beginning with line 19, strike out all through line 5 on page 151, and insert the following: (2) Report by Appropriations Commit(cid:173)tees.-Whenever any bill or resolution which provides new advanced spending authority described in subsection (c) (2) (C) is re(cid:173)ported by any committee of the Senate or the House of Representatives, the Commit(cid:173)tee on Appropriations of that House may, in witl:lin 10 calendar days (not counting any day on which that House is n~t in session) beginning with the day following the day on which it is so reported, submit a report to its House setting forth its recommenda(cid:173)tions with respect to the level of new ad(cid:173)vance spending authority provided by such bill or resolution, such report to be issued as a separate report by the Committee on Appropriations or to be included the report of the committee reporting such bill or resolution. It shall not be in order in that House to consider such bill or resolution until the Committee on Appropriations of that House has submitted the report required by this paragraph or, if such Committee fails to submit such report, until the expiration of such 10-day period. on: page 158, strike out lines 16 through 20, and msert the following: \"4. As provided in section 401 (b) (2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, reports on new advance spending authority described in section 401(c) (2) (C) of that Act.\" On page 159, strike out lines 7 through 11, and insert the following: \"(d) As provided in section 401 (b) (2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, re(cid:173)ports on new advance spending authority described in section 401(c) (2) (C) of that Act.'' Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, this amendment is a modified version of my printed amendment No. 1044. My amend(cid:173)ment in no way affects the discipline im(cid:173)posed by the bill. It relates only to the jurisdictional question affecting certain specific types of legislation. Mr. President, S. 1541 is designed to promote fiscal responsibility by reform(cid:173)ing the budget process so as to make it reflect congressional priorities. It will establish a framework, reflecting Con(cid:173)gressional priorities, which will provide a discipline under which all congres(cid:173)sional action affecting the budget can be seen in an overall context. I strongly support S. 1541 for the disci(cid:173)pline it creates and for the central role it gives congressional decisionmaking. \u00b7 As I have said, my amendment in no way affects the discipline imposed by the bill. It relates only to a jurisdictional question affecting certain specific types of legislation. The amendment would de(cid:173)lete the requirement that legislation af(cid:173)fecting certain programs be referred to the Appropriations Committee but in(cid:173)stead offers that committee a~ oppor(cid:173)tunity to report on this legislation before the Senate acts on it. Under S. 1541, legislation creating a new entitlement to payments or increas(cid:173)ing existing entitlements must be re(cid:173)ferred to the Appropriations Committee for\u00b7 a period of 10 days after it is re(cid:173)ported by a substantive committee. This requirement of referral to the Appropri(cid:173)ations Committee would not affect exist(cid:173)ing trust fund programs but it would apply to such programs as veterans' com(cid:173)pensation, veterans' pensions, veterans' educational benefits, payments to needy, aged, blind, and disabled persons, medi(cid:173)cal assistance to the needy, and food stamps. This additional referral to the Appro(cid:173)priations Committee was not requested by that committee and it will occur at a time when the Appropriations Com(cid:173)mittee will be fully occupied in attempt(cid:173)ing to process all appropriations legisla(cid:173)tion.

            "654": ". 7710 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 21, 1974-So far the Administration has asked for mandatory reporting only by the oil in(cid:173)dustry. Says Roye L. Lowry, an officer with the statistical policy division of the Office of Management & Budget, whic:l;l must clear department requests for legislation: \"So far as I know, no one has proposed initiating legislation to make reporting mandatory, and the OMB has not discussed the subject as policy.\" Business fears about protecting the con(cid:173)fidentiality of information given to the gov(cid:173)ernment were heightened this week when. the Temporary Court of Appeals for Eco(cid:173)nomic Stabilization ruled that the CLC must make public data submitted to it by business and labor. Most statisticians in and out of government believe that the only way to as(cid:173)suage business fears is to pass legislation\u00b7 guaranteeing confidentiality. In addition, most economists and statis(cid:173)ticians believe that not enough has \\been done to analyze systematically the costs and benefits of government information collect(cid:173)ing .. Explains Kenneth Boulding, an econo(cid:173)mist at the University of Colorado, \"The problem is that it is easy to calculate the costs, but very difficult to identify the bene(cid:173)fits.\" There is also the larger question of whether more information will result in better policymaking. Says one government economist: \"You can have all the data in the world and still fall in a hole.\" and oftentimes results in \u00b7 an: \u00b7unfair poorly thought-out decision. Mr. President, the main thrust of this legislation is to free up the gasoline mar(cid:173)ket\u00b7 which is bogged down by the FEO's 17 form. This measure, if enacted, would further decrease Government interven(cid:173)tion as it applies to motor gasoline allo-. cations, allowing suppliers\u00b7 to adjust by their own means without going through governmental red tape. At the same time, I realize the reasons for passing the Emergency Allocation Act and it is for that reason, the Federal En(cid:173)ergy Office would still retain the author(cid:173)ity to review these adjustments, so as to assure that these allocations would be done on an equitable basis and that no favoritism would be given to a major brand of gasoline station over an in(cid:173)dependent gasoline station: Mr. President, I have been informed that the Federal Energy Office is present(cid:173)ly considering revision of the regulations governing allocation adjustments, and that the measure I am proposing today is one which is under discussion. Each and every one of us here today realizes that the Federal Energy Office has done an outstanding job in trying to solve the immediate problems of the energy crisis. It is only after this program has been in effect that adjustments to the program, such as the one which I am suggesting today, can be seriously considered. I hope my colleagues will join with me in urging immediate consideration of this proposal and I ask that the text of the bill I am introducing at \u00b7this time be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my re(cid:173)marks. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: \u00b7 te d' s. 3210 . Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That section By Mr. GURNEY: S. 3210. A bill to amend the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act. Referred to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. Mr. GURNEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill which would amend the Emergency Allocation Act to enable supplies of motor gasoline to make ap(cid:173)provals of requests made by wholesale purchasers who submit an FEO 17 form for an adjustment of their allocation of motor gasoline of any amount up to a 40-percent increase. Mr. President, presently the law re-quires that those wholesale purchasers 4 (c) ( 4) of the Emergency Petroleum All a(cid:173)wishing to have an adjustment of their cation Act of 1973 is amended by inserting motor gasoline allocation submit an FEO \u00b7\u00b7immediately before the period at the end 17 form to their supplier.

It was also the contention of these petroleum marketers and dealers that the oil industry and suppliers are totally _ familiar with the marketing conditions and demands of each area they \u00b7service and that Federal Energy Office approval on a request for a 2,0-percent increase By Mr. GURNEY: S. 3211. A bill to amend the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, relat(cid:173)ing to adjustments in the allocation of gasoline. Referred to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. Mr. GURNEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing an amendment to sec(cid:173)tion 4(c) (4) of the Emergency Petro- (cid:173)leum Act of 1973. Basica1ly, my amend(cid:173)ment would require that when the Fed(cid:173)eral Energy Office is making adjustments in the allocation of gasoline established under the regulations, such adjustments will be made for a period of not less than\u00b7 180 days. \u00b7 Mr. President, on March 8, Deputy Ad(cid:173)ministrator John Sawhill attended a meeting\u00b7 in my office with members of the Florida petroleum marketers and deal-\u00b7 ers. During the course of this meeting, several aspects-of the mandatory alloca(cid:173)tion program were discussed, among which was the problem encountered by gasoline owners and operators as it re(cid:173)lated to their uncertainty of present al(cid:173)lotments past a few months period. In speaking of the posture of concern, I find that in the application of the act in its present state, it has a two-fold ef(cid:173)fect for which I am certain it was not intended. The current ability of the Fed(cid:173)eral Energy Office to only grant increased adjustments in the allocation of gaso(cid:173)line for a period of 60 days simply does not provide the individual dealer, coping with all of tlie other problems attendant to the energy crisis, with a sufficient ad(cid:173)justment upon which to base any reason(cid:173)able business or operational projection. I have been advised that Federal En(cid:173)ergy Office is not attempting to make adjustments for a 12-month period. However, I\" have been informed, this is only an experiment which may be scrap(cid:173)ped not because the program is unwork(cid:173)able or infeasible, but due to a lack of manpower to operate this program. Another factor I would like to point out as to the urgency of such an amend(cid:173)ment is that in filing of an FEO 17 form, the attendant processing of these appli(cid:173)cations simply requires so many days of transit and action time that it clearly makes the current 60-day period of the authorized increased allocation adjust(cid:173)ment impractical and unrealistic. Therefore, I submit this amendment as a more practical, urgently needed method of assisting and modifying the basic regulating authority to better serve the needs of the American people Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks the bill I am introducing today be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: \u00b7 s. 3211 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That section 4(c) (4) of the Emergency Petroleum Allo(cid:173)cation Act of 1973 is amended by insert(cid:173)ing immediately before the period at the end thereof the following: \"Increased adjust(cid:173)ments in the allocation of gasoline estab(cid:173)lished under such regulation shall be effec(cid:173)tive for a period of not less than one hundred and eighty days.\".

The Ambassador has re-source, are also without foundation. portedly told several non-Government visitors recently that South Vietnam is in a crucial period and that he sees his role as unyielding support to build up and preserve a non-Communist regime. He is reported to have pressed Washington to provide new weapons for Saigon to counteract the infiltration of troops, tanks, and artillery from North Vietnam since the ceasefire. For example, plans have been made for the delivery of .F-5E fighter planes to replace the slower, less maneuverable and less heavily armed F-5's, many of which were rushed to South Vietnam in the weeks before the cease-fire .. Paragraph 66-The USG has never made a secret of the fact that it intends to replace some F-5A jet aircraft with faster, more maneuverable F-5Es. In the DOD press briefing of January 8, 1974, Lt. Gen. James said that this was no new information. \"We have said all along,'' he told reporters, \"that we bad supplied the South Vietnamese with the F-5 Tiger One, which was the earliest F-5, and that considerable improvements had been made on sub(cid:173)sequent models that we bad contracted to provide them, and these old aircraft would be replaced on a one-for-one basis. This will be done in time .... \"The USG does not regard replacement of some F-5A aircraft with the later F~5E as a violation of the Paris agree(cid:173)ments. The F-5E is simply a newer version of the F-5A, which is no longer available. \u00b7 VIOLATION IS CHARGED Privately, officers in the International Commission pf Control and Supervision sco.ti at the American contention that supply of the planes does not violate the Paris agreements, which permit only one-for-one replacement of weapons \"of the same characteristics and properties.\" A high-ranking official of one of the non-Com(cid:173)munist delegations, asked recently if he thought the United States was faithfully observing the one-for-one rule, replied, \"Of course not.\" There is nothing the commissioil can do about it without per(cid:173)mission from both the South Vietnamese Government and the Vietcong to investigate, and permission is unlikely to be forth(cid:173)coming from the Saigon side. Similarly, the commission has been unable to audit other incoming weapons and ammunition for both sides. During the first year after the cease-fire, the United States provided South Vietnam with $5.4-million worth of ammunition a week, apparently unaccompanied by pressure to restrain military activities. .~ beveral weeks ago Elbridge Durbrow, who was Ambassador South Vietnam from 1957 to 1961, came to Saigon and met with Ambassador Martin and General Murray. Mr. Durbrow, who de(cid:173)nounced the Paris agreements and who declares, \"I am a domino(cid:173)theory man,\" was asked by newsmen whether the American offi(cid:173)cials had indicated that they were trying to keep South Vietnam from violating the cease-fire. \"Ncr'~ from anybody did we hear that,'' he replied. Then, referring to General Murray, he said: \"He's not that kind of man at all(cid:173)just the opposite. If you are not going to defend yourself you might as well give up and let Hanoi take over.\" to 'Paragraphs 67 and 68-Shipler states that a high-ranking offi(cid:173)cial of \"one of the non-Communist delegations,\u00b7 asked recently if he thought the U.S. was faithfully observing the one-for-one rule,\" replied, \"of course not.\" The ICCS official was quite right, but not in the way Shipler implies. As a matter of fact, the USG unfortu(cid:173)I,lately has not been able in one single category to provide one-for(cid:173)one replacements of all the material lost by the GVN while defend(cid:173)i:ng itself from continuing NVA/VC aggression since the cease-fire. Article VII of the Paris agreement specifies that the two South Vietnamese parties shall not accept introduction of troops, mili(cid:173)tary advisers and military personnel including armaments, muni(cid:173)tions and war material into South Vietnam. Both parties, however, are permitted to make periodic replacements of armaments, muni(cid:173)tions and war material which have been destroyed, damaged, worn out or used up after the cease-fire on the basis of piece-for-piece, of the same characteristics and properties, under supervision of the Joint Military Commission (TPJMC) and of the ICCS. Article 18 (c) gives the ICCS specific responsibilities regarding prohibition under article VIL. The ICCS protocol specified the designation of ICCS teams at points of entry, some of which are listed in para(cid:173)graph B of article 4, and some are to be designated by the two South Vietnamese parties. These pertinent sections of the Paris agreement and of the ICCS protocol have not been implemented. Designated points of entry are the \"modalities\" of the eop.ttol and supervision of military shipments. The\u00b7 record shDws thete -bas bee!l considera_ble unwillingness on the part of the so-cailed\u00b7 PRG to help the ICes deploy to sites in territory controlled by the Viet(cid:173)cong\u00b7. While the GVN has designated the additional points of entry, as required, the PRG has refused ~o do so. The PRG, as a matter of fact, has tried to prevent deployment of ICCS teams. For example, an ICCS helicopter taking a team in April 1973 to the entry point of Lao Bao in PRG territory_ was shot down claiming the .Hves of several ICCS members and the American crew. It is unjust for Ship(cid:173)ler to say that the Saigon side is unlikely to grant permtssion to supervise replacement of weaponry for South Vietnam., TP,e GVN has indicated its willingness, time and tl!lle again, with implementation of the agreement and protocols provided the other side displays a similar cooperative attitude. 'Thus, the activi(cid:173)ties of the pofrit of entry tearns have been frustrated. At the be(cid:173)~innlng; on \u00b7a unilateral basis, the Canadian and Indonesian dele(cid:173)gations joined in involving themselves in supervision and control of military shipments and the GVN did not object to this. Shipler does not point out that the ICCS has no superv'ision whatever of military shipments coming into South Vietnam from the north. Nor does he mention anywhere in his article the infiltration of combat troops from North Vietnam since the cease-fire, a fact well known to him. Paragraphs 69-70-The Shipler quotation of Ambassador Our(cid:173)brow ends the article consistently on another distortion. Accord(cid:173)ing to other sources, Durbrow was making the point that no one could expect the South Vietnamese unilaterally to observe the cease fire if the other side ignores it completely.

            "754": "7810 In any case, it is not properly up to the proponents of competition to prove their case. It is up to the monopolists to prove the case for monopoly, and I don't believe that they can do so. The time has come to end this unfor(cid:173)tunate Government monopoly. To this end, I have introduced H.R. 433 which would serve this important purpose. At this time I wish to share with my colleagues these excerpts from the testi(cid:173)mony of John L. Ryan, former Chair .. man of the U.S. Postal Rate Commission, before the House Subcommittee on Postal Service on January 24, 1974: MAIL HANDLING NEEDS COMPETITION (By John L. Ryan) (The following is excerpted from testi(cid:173)mony given before the House Subcommittee on Posal Service on Jan. 24, 1974, by Mr. Ryan, former chairman of the United States Postal Rate Commission.) It appears to be the impression of many people that, by the application of skill, knowledge and hard work, the Postal Rate Commission can somehow hold down postal rates and improve service; it cannot. It can(cid:173)not even apply much independent judgment as to what individual rates should be and, in my opinion, should not have such powers beyond the current extent. It can, and I believe has already, made some imaginative contributions in the matter of mail classi(cid:173)fications, but in the matter of rates and services, it is limited by real circumstances it can't and should not be able to control. The business of the Postal Service is part monopoly and part competitive. There is competition, both direct and indirect, for most fourth and third-class mail; second(cid:173)class will become competitive as increases bring prices to the threshhold which will permit a profit. Letter mail, for our purposes first-class, is protected by a statutory monop(cid:173)oly and has no direct competition. The vari(cid:173)able costs of many of the large volume classes are intermixed and cannot be defini(cid:173)tively separated. When Postal Service costs increase to the extent that expense will significantly ex(cid:173)ceed income, they petition the Rate Com(cid:173)mission for price increases to redress the im(cid:173)balance. From a practical point of view, the price level of the competitive services has been set by the market. If competitors' costs have also gone up there may be some leeway, but experience has indicated it will be small. Any income requirement that cannot be pro(cid:173)duced by these competitive services falls on first-class. Since the Postal service was or(cid:173)ganized its costs seem to have increased faster than its competitors. SPECIAL RATES The situation is further complicated by all kinds of special rates, the nature of the Postal Service's costs, \"the condition and ac(cid:173)curacy of their record and date collection, their interpretation of cost attribution. But these are simpiy decorations on the regula(cid:173)tory cake. The Commission cannot set rates above competition without pricing the Service out of that particular market. This would reduce volume, the costs of which are Inixed with other classes and cannot be reduced pro(cid:173)portionately, producing higher costs for the other services. Higher costs would then re(cid:173)quire higher prices, forcing one service after another out of eKistence, until only the monopoly service was left. The Commission can alternatively hold competitive prices at market levels and ab(cid:173)sorb the balance of increased expense in the monopoly service. But that is a fairly simple procedure requiring limited judg(cid:173)ment. And I see no way to really wiggle out from this dllemma with a satisfactory solu(cid:173)tion under current conditions. \u00b7 EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS It seems to me there are only four choices: ( 1) Abandon the break-even concept of the Postal Reorganization Act which will throw much of any increase in expense on the backs of the taxpayers; (2) Continue as we are go(cid:173)ing, which will increasingly load a larger bur(cid:173)den on the first-class mailers; (3) Put all of the Postal Service's product lines under stat(cid:173)utory monopoly protection; (4) Remove the monopoly protection from letter mail and allow competition across the board, at the same time freeing the Postal Service itself from monopoly requirements. If there are proponents of 1, 2, 3, they can argue their own case. To me the last choice is so persuasive that it is really the only one. It will reduce mailing costs to the gen(cid:173)eral mailer and improve service to everyone. Official comments by legislators, letters to the editor, a wide variety of public sources indicate mail service is unsatisfactory. In addition to paving the way to the solution of the rate dilemma described above, I am convinced that real progress in mail service can only come when the law is revised in such a way as to permit private persons to compete with the Postal Service in the col(cid:173)lection and delivery of letter mail. (It is my understanding that H.R. 433, introduced in January 1973, by Rep. Philip Crane, R.-Ill., if passed into law, would produce this result.) I believe that under all but very unusual market conditions free competition provides better customer service at a lower price than monopoly and regulation. In fact, pub(cid:173)lic utmty regulation came into existence as a proxy for market forces in those unusual conditions economists and legislators came to recognize as producing a natural monopoly, a market condition whereby the lowest cost and best service result from the existence of a single producer. I do not believe there is any substantive evidence that letter mail service has any of the economic characteristics of a natural mo(cid:173)nopoly. In fact, there is some historical in(cid:173)dication in the statutory monopoly franchise was given the government in the first place to protect the U.S. mails from private com .. petition. Even if I am wrong and the Postal Service is a natural monopoly with respect to letter mail, no harm will be done by repeal of the private express statutes. In this circum(cid:173)stance, private enterprise will simply fail to compete effectively. On the other hand, if the processing of letter mail is not a natural monopoly, the existence of competition to the Postal Serv\u00b7 ice will bring to mailers all the advantages of a free market, lower prices, better and more specialized services, choice of patron\u00b7 age, progressive application , of innovation and technology. And further, this situation will improve the lot not only of the mailers, but of the Postal Service itself. There has been demon\u00b7 strated in our proceedings no conclusive evidence that under current or anticipated capacity rates the Postal Service displays economies of scale, that iS decreasing unit costs with increasing volume. It is quite pos(cid:173)sible that a decrease in volume in letter mail would decrease unit costs, inasmuch as poor customer service strongly suggests that major portions of the letter mail system are op(cid:173)erating in excess of optimum capacity. In any case a lower volume would permit more orderly processing regardless of effect on unit cost. Competition in some utility services in which broad areas of the public have an in(cid:173)terest has produced a concept which has been given the pejorative title of \"cream skim(cid:173)Ining,\" the concentration of service effort to lower-cost areas, to the supposed neglect of higher-cost areas. To the extent that this is thought of as a disadvantage to customers, it can be so only under monopoly. Under open market conditions so-called cream skimming is the very essence of the division March 21, 1974 of labor which provides customers with the opportunity to select what is for them the optimum quality at the lowest price, thereby assuring the absence of undue discrimina(cid:173)tion. FREEDOM OF CHOICE An example in the postal service area of the value of competition and concommitant division of labor is apparent in the move(cid:173)ment of small packages. Here, as you know, the Postal Service does not have a statutory monopoly and competes rather directly with United Parcel Service and a variety of other local and regional common and contract car(cid:173)riers. As a result, the shipper in many areas has a choice of services with different char(cid:173)acteristics and can select that most suited for his requirements. It is also interesting to note that one of the major specific expenditures of the Postal Service toward improvement in service and costs in directed in large part toward parcel shipment, where there is direct competition, and, in balance, toward bulk mail, another class of service in which competition exists. I do not say this in criticism. It is a perfect(cid:173)ly proper and beneficial response to competi(cid:173)tion. There is no way for me or anyone else to forecast the shape of a market for postal services open across the board to private business and the incentive of competition. I can confidently forecast that in such cir(cid:173)cumstances in a few years time mail service to the citizens in this country will dramat(cid:173)ically improve and in a few more years there will be startling new technology in the way mail is handled. And there will be lower real costs and hence prices for everyone. Open competition has always been the condition which best serves the customer, short of compelling theoretical or practical evidence to the contrary. Such evidence has not been produced concerning mail service. In any case, it is not properly up to the pro(cid:173)ponents of competition to prove their case. It is up to the monopolists to prove the case for monopoly, and I don't believe that they can do so. EXTENSION OF FACILITIES ON THE ISLAND OF DIEGO GARCIA HON. PATRICIA SCHROEDER OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, March 21, 1974 Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, the Defense Department supplemental budg(cid:173)et request for fiscal year 1974 (H.R. 12565) contains a provision to build up facilities on the remote United States(cid:173)United Kingdom island base at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. The Hon(cid:173)orable LEE HAMILTON'S Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Near East and South Asia was sufficiently concerned to hold 5 days of about this proposal hearings on it. My own Armed Services Committee voted approval of this project and the entire supplemental budget after barely more than 5 hours of hearings. I believe that the testimony of Earl C. Ravenal before Mr. HAMILTON's subcom(cid:173)mittee clearly sets forth the important questions and, as this statement will probably not be published before H.R. 12565 is ramrodded through the House, I would like to take this opportunity to bring it to the attention of my colleagues. Mr. Ravenal puts it well: The ultimate question, of which Diego Garcia is only an early test, is whether we ",
            "804": "7860 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 22, 1974 critics now demand a total cut-off of all U.S. military and economic support. They would, in effect, snatch failure from the jaws of success, and deliver South Viet(cid:173)nam and its 18 mlllion people to the Com(cid:173)munists by default. Since South Vietnam stands steady on the battle front, its enemies have mounted new attacks on another front-Washington. The government of South Vietnam, and its elected leader, President Nguyen Van Thieu, are portrayed far and wide as corrupt and oppressive and thereby unworthy of con(cid:173)tinued U.S. support. These verbal assaults have reached a cres(cid:173)cendo unparalleled since the days of the Vietnam \"moratorium\" and the march on the Pentagon. Familiar voices that once de(cid:173)manded U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam now denounce any and all U.S. aid to Saigon. Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden set up shop in Congress and openly lobby for the aban(cid:173)donment of South Vietnam. A three-week anti-Vietnam seminar is organized in a com(cid:173)mittee hearing room of the U.S. House of Representatives. Remnants of\u00b7 the \"Vietnam Veterans Against the War\" invade and briefly seize the information offices of the South Vietnamese Embassy in Washington. \"Study groups,'' composed of articulate and well-known propagandists against U.S. policy in Indochina, visit Vietnam and re(cid:173)turn with shocking new tales of torture and imprisonment of tens of thousands of inno(cid:173)cent \"political prisoners.\" Their views and expressions are afforded prominence before committees of Congress and in the news media with scant attention to their creden(cid:173)tials or credibility. Volumes of testimony and statistics recite a long litany of alleged savagery and wrong(cid:173)doing by \"General Thieu and his henchmen.\" By sheer weight of words, the professional Vietnam critics seek to confuse, confound and wear down their opposition. Taken alone, such organized efforts to in(cid:173)fluence U.S. foreign policy could be dis(cid:173)missed as so much propaganda. But in an America weary of war and preoccupied with newer problems of inflation, energy and Wa(cid:173)tergate, the critics of Vietnam have gone largely unchallenged and their allegations mostly unanswered. Without rebuttal, there is a danger that the views of these critics in time could gain acceptance, through repetition if for no other reason. To afford Congress and the American peo(cid:173)ple an opportunity to hear from both sides and to reach reasoned judgements based on all the facts, the American Security Council in cooperation with the South Vietnamese council on Foreign Relations sponsored a private, non-partisan fact-finding visit to South Vietnam. The mission was headed by Ambassador John Moore Allison (Ret.), former Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, whose distinguished diplomatic career in(cid:173)cluded Ambassadorships in Japan, Indonesia and Czechoslovakia. Other members included: Congressman Philip M. Crane (R-Til.}, member of House Committees on Banking and Currency and House Administration. A former history professor at Indiana and Brad(cid:173)ley Universities, Congressman Crane has vis(cid:173)ited Indochina on several occasions and con(cid:173)ducted a special investigation of prison con(cid:173)ditions on Con Son Island for a report to Congress. Richard W. Smith, Chairman, National Federation of Young Republicans, who also serves as Administrative Assistant to the Minority Leader of the Florida State Senate. Dr. Anthony Kubek, Research Professor; University of Dallas, author, lecturer and former visiting professor at three Chinese universities. He has traveled extensively in Asia and presently serves as consultant to the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. Ambassador Elbridge Durbrow (Ret.), Director of Freedom Studies Center, Boston, Virginia, and former Ambassador to South Vietnam (1957-61), whose.38-year diplomatic career included extended tours of duty in Moscow, Warsaw, Bucharest, Rome, Singa(cid:173)pore, Lisbon and with the NATO Council in Paris. Charles A. Stewart, Director of Communi(cid:173)cations, Institute for American Strategy, and Director of Broadcast Communications, American Security Council. Philip C. Clarke, correspondent and com(cid:173)mentator, Mutual Broadcasting System, and Ca.pitol Editor of the Ame.rican Security Council's Washington Report. Clarke, a jour(cid:173)nalist for 35 years, served as an AP foreign correspondent and Newsweek General Editor. Accompanying the group as an observer was veteran correspondent James Cary, Wash(cid:173)ington Bureau Chief, Copley Press. (Texts of Cary's published dispatches from Vietnam are included in this report's appendix.) . The group traveled by plane, helicopter and jeep from Saigon to Quang Tri in the far North, and from the Mekong Delta to Con Son Island off the southeast coast of South Vietnam. It witnessed soldiers guard(cid:173)ing the ceasefire lines, peasants harvesting rice, village schools in session, government officials at work, and a host of other activi(cid:173)ties that comprise a nation striving to sur(cid:173)vive in the twilight of an undeclared war thrust upon it by an aggressor that still aims at total conquest. There were lengthy private meetings with President Nguyen Van Thieu in the Presiden(cid:173)tial Palace in Saigon; Hoang Due Nha, Min(cid:173)ister of Information; with Foreign Minister Vuong Van Bac; Pham Kim Ngoc, the former National Commissioner for Planning; Nguyen Due Cuong, Minister of Trade and Industry; Ton That Trinh, Minister of Agriculture; Pho Ba Quan, Special Assistant to the Min(cid:173)ister of Finance; and with the Commander of the National Police, Brig. Gen. Nguyen Khac Binh. There were meetings also with leading members of the South Vietnamese National Assembly, with private business and profes(cid:173)sional men, and with students, shopkeepers, and workers. In the countryside, there were briefings by Corps Commanders in Military Regions 1 and 4, and inspection trips of de(cid:173)fense lines. Provincial representatives afforded visits to community centers, banks, and irri(cid:173)gation projects. U.S. Ambassador to Saigon, Graham Mar(cid:173)tin, conducted an extensive personal briefing, along with members of his staff, and there was a detailed review from Maj. Gen. John E. Murray, who heads the U.S. Defense At(cid:173)tache mission in South Vietnam. While the fact-finding group claims no \"instant expertise'' or easy answers to the many complex problems of Vietnam, it did reach a number of conclusions based on first(cid:173)hand observations. II.-\"POLICE STATE\": WHAT THE FACTS SHOW Charges that South Vietnam, with U.S. fi(cid:173)nancial and technical support, has become a \"police state\" are not supported by the facts. South Vietnam's 122,000-man national police force has the function of preserving law and order in both the cities and the countryside; it is a vital element in the government's ef(cid:173)forts to provide greater safety and security against terrorist attack, kidnapping, assas(cid:173)sination, and sabotage. Since its reorganiza(cid:173)tion in 1971, it has become an increasingly efficient force in securing areas that before were easy prey to guerrilla raids, infiltration and intimidation. By its nature, this fight against subversion is almost certain to lead to some abuses. But there is a definite effort to improve procedures and safeguard d-ividual rights. As in the U.S., the police operate under the law and arrests are made only for viola .. tions of the law. Rather than serving only in(cid:173)to protect the government and suppress polit(cid:173)ical opposition, as alleged by critics, the na(cid:173)tional police are welcomed by most South Vietnamese as a protector. In hundreds of remote hamlets, the gray-uniformed police(cid:173)man is the lone symbol of authority and, as such, often a prime target of communist assassination squads. The courage and hero(cid:173)ism of the policeman is legendary in many rural areas, as it is in the refugee-created cities. Much of the progress made by the national police is due to the advice and training pro(cid:173)vided at modest cost by U.S. experts under the Office of Public Safety (OPS), a branch of the State Department's AID program of assistance to foreign gove\u00b7rnments at their request. Although this aid-and-training pro(cid:173)gram was ended in South Vietnam under terms of the Paris peace agreement, a hand(cid:173)ful of U.S. civilian technicians continue to provide advice in the operation of a newly(cid:173)installed computer system which keeps tabs on more than 10 million South Vietnamese. Far from being a. secret police de\u00b7vice to op(cid:173)press the populace, as charged by critics, the new computer system is used primarily to curb crime and enforce the law, just as in most advanced countries, including the U.S. And through frequent checking of I.D. cards, the South Vietnamese police are able to spot lawbreakers as well as enemy agents, thereby preventing large-scaLe infiltration of highly(cid:173)trained saboteurs, sappers and spies into the cities such as occurred during the '68 Tet offensive. Despite such achievements, OPS itself is now a favorite object of attack by opponents of U.S. foreign assistance who charge that it promotes \"oppressive police states.\" The record shows quite the opposite is true. In South Vietnam, it seems that lef\u00b7tist prop(cid:173)aganda attacks against the police are in(cid:173)creased in almost direct proportion to the improvement of police efficiency and effec(cid:173)tiveness. III.-\"POLrriCAL PRISONERS\": FACT VS. FICTION Charges that the South Vietnamese gov(cid:173)ernment has jailed tens, even hundreds, of thousands of \"political prisoners\" are in variance with the facts. Following recent allegations that the Thieu government was holding up to 202,000 political opponents in barbarous captivity, the U.S. Embassy in Saigon undertook what it described as \"an exhaustive and pains(cid:173)taking analysis utilizing all available sources, including the personal knowledge of U.S. police advisers who had been on the scene until early 1973. The results of this official U.S. Embassy survey, comprising 15 closely typewritten pages, covers every penal institution in South Vietnam, from the four national prisons and 35 provincial jails to local police lockups where suspected crim(cid:173)inals are held for up to five days before disposition of their cases. The Embassy survey reached \"the firm conclusion that the total prisoner and detention population in South Vietnam in the July-August, 1973, period (when the check was conducted) was 35,139. This figure comprises civilian prisoners of all types, not just 'political prisoners,' however defined.\" The U.S. Embassy placed the total capacity of South Vietnam's prison and detention system at 51,941 as of December 31, 1972. The total prison occupancy on that date was 43,717, and less since then. The Embassy said that its survey \"con(cid:173)clusively refutes the widely-spread charge thaJt South Vietnam government jails harbor '200,000 political prisoners.' \" And it found no evidence whatsoever that large numbers of persons had been jailed solely for their political opposition to the present govern(cid:173)ment. The allegation that the Saigon government harbors \"202,000 political prisoners\" was ",

But I would be very concerned Sibout now building in a rigidity which would cause, if it were so built in, a situation where we might even lose the support, concurrence, and en\u00b7 thusiasm that we now have gained through this process of education and evolution as the bill has developed among the Members of the Senate. SO, for that reason, I regretfully OP\u00b7 pose the amendment; but once again I commend my distinguished colleague from Delaware for the outstanding con\u00b7 tribution he has made to the bill and the outstanding contribution he continues to make by even offering this amendment and pointing out that certainly we should not by any means weaken this bill, and if anything we should continue to move in the direction of strengthening it as we gain experience with the provi\u00b7 sions that have been outlined in S. 1541 as it now stands. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. ERVIN. Mr. President, I just want to say that the Senator from Tilinois has made such a fine argument against this amendment that I do not feel I can add anything to it. I would also like to say, as he did, that the distinguished Senator from Delaware has been one of the most dili\u00b7 gent members of the Government Opera\u00b7 tions Committee, and it would be im\u00b7 possible for me to overmagnify the many contributions which he has made to the work of the committee, both in respect to this particular bill and in respect to the other legislation which has come be\u00b7 fore the committee during this session of Congress. I feel that I ought to express those thoughts because it would be impossible for any committee to have a more faith\u00b7 ful and more diligent member than the Government Operations Committee has had in the person of the distinguished Senator from Delaware. Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I shall yield time in a moment to the Senator from Georgia, but I would just like to thank the distinguished chairman of the Com\u00b7 mittee on Government Operations. It has been a great pleasure to work on this legislation. As in many other areas, he has certainly provided great leadership to the committee, and I thank him for his generous remarks. I yield the Senator from Georgia such time as he may require. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CLARK) . The Chair would remind Sena(cid:173)tors that under the previous order, at 11 o'clock the Senate will return to the con(cid:173)sideration of the Nelson-Mondale amendment, and that is about 1 minute from now. Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I think I can finish my remarks in 1 minute. I join the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from North Carolina in com\u00b7 mending the Senator from Delaware. He and I have spent many hours in this work on the Senate Budget, Manage(cid:173)ment, and Expenditures Subcommittee measure. In working on this legislation, although it is not as tough or as disciplined as he would like or I would like, without his presence, without his great effort, we would have a much looser bill than we have now. I commend him and I also commend him on his amendment. I agree with some of the criticisms which have been made but I, for one, will vote for the amendment, because its vir\u00b7 tues certainly overwhelm its disadvan\u00b7 tages. The Senator from Delaware has made c magnificent contribution toward making this legislation meaningful and capable of providing real discipline for the first time in the budgetary process. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CLARK). Under the previous order, the Senate will now resume consideration of amendment No. 1046. Who yields time? Mr. HUGH SCOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. On whose time? Mr. HUGH SCOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered, and the clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I regret to have to oppose the amend(cid:173)ment offered by the distinguished Sen(cid:173)ator from Minnesota (Mr. MoNDALE) and the distinguished Senator from Wiscon(cid:173)sin (Mr. NELSON), but I am opposed to it. It would limit a member from serving for more than 6 years on the new budget committee. It would prevent members from gaining the same kind of experience over a longer period of time in the areas of the committee's jurisdiction. Members would not be able to become as expert as, say, the members of the Finance and Appropriations Committees would. For instance, they would only serve for 6 years. Additionally, if they can only serve on the committee for a brief period of time and would then retain ad infinitum their membership on two other major standing committees, obviously the time of the Budget Committee members would be badly fragmented and split and they would not be able to give the budget committee the kind of time and atten(cid:173)tion, the energy and the talent, the dedi(cid:173)cation and the service that they would otherwise give if they served only on that major committee and one other major committee, as is presently the rule in the Senate. Second, by so doing, by having a rotat(cid:173)ing committee, the stature of that com\u00b7 mittee would be greatly reduced. This legislation, once it becomes law, will be difficult to implement. So while I believe it can possibly be a workable act, it re(cid:173)mains to be seen whether it will work. A great deal will depend on the human element in both Houses. If this committee is looked on as just a temporary committee on which one may serve and get a little exposure and a little experience, and then shift back to another committee, it will reduce the stature of that committee. This commit\u00b7 tee needs stature. The Appropriations and the Finance Committees already have stature. We have a new committee here and it will be a vitally important committee which will need equal stature with that of the Appropriations and Fi\u00b7 nance Committees and other committees. It will detract from the stature of that committee if it becomes a sort of rolling stone committee on which members will rotate. It would be just another commit\u00b7 tee assignment for a member-just an(cid:173)other chore, another burden-and not one of his most important committee as(cid:173)signments. Third, the amendment would preclude the development of long-term personal relations with members of the new com(cid:173)mittee and the other standing commit\u00b7 tees whose legislative work would have to be coordinated with the new budget committee. The Finance Committee has a long his\u00b7 tory, and the Appropriations Committee has a history which goes back deep into the roots of this institution. They both have great stature. The members of these committees, because of their seniority on such committees, generally, not only have great stature within the committee structure but also within the Senate. If we are going to set up a committee now that rotates its membership, its mem\u00b7 bers will be deprived of the opportunity to gain valuable experience and would not be as dedicated in their service to that committee, because of that fact, nor be able to accumulate the expertise in their field, which all members of other committees are able to gain with long and continuous service. I am afraid that they will not then have the prestige that will enable them to act with the kind of comity that will be needed between the budget committee and the Appropriations and Finance Committees, if we are going to make this legislation work. The members of the Appropriations and Finance and other committees may otherwise view those who will be work\u00b7 ing on the Budget Committee as ju.st messing into the business of the Appro\u00b7 priations and Finance and other com\u00b7 mittees. It will damage chances of favor(cid:173)able implementation of this act, once it becomes law. Finally, I do not believe we should veer away from the normal procedure governing the service on standing com\u00b7 mi ttees in this body. If this is really going to be a major standing committee, then it should stand on an equal basis with all other such standing committees, and its mem(cid:173)bers should understand that. Mr. President, I trust, for these vari(cid:173)ous reasons, that the Senate will not agree to the amendment of the distin(cid:173)guished Senators from Wisconsin and Minnesota, Mr. NELSON and Mr. MONDALE. Mr. HUGH SCOTT. Mr. President, I should like to say that I agree with the distinguished Senator from West Vir\u00b7 ginia. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Republican leader. Mr. ERVIN.

A BILL TO HELP A VERT FUTURE SHORTAGES HON. JERRY LITTON OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, March 21, 1974 Mr. LI'ITON. Mr. Speakler, in the past few years as shortages of various raw, agricultural, and manufactured products have begun to appear in our economy, one continuing question has remained in my mind: Why, since our society is so sophisticated and advanced, could not our Government foresee and resolve most of these shortages before their economic impacts were felt? The energy shortage has brought greater focus to this question and leads me to one conclusion: That the Govern(cid:173)ment is a \"now\" type of system capable primarily of providing for the short-term problems of the American people. Mr. Speaker, I have today introduced a bill which would create one central, broad, long-range planning agency re(cid:173)sponsible solely for projecting future so(cid:173)cial, economic, and natural resource re(cid:173)quirements of our Nation. This agency would assume the long-range\u00b7 planning functions currently within existing de(cid:173)partments and would provide a greater and more thorough nature of planning throughout all those agencies which deal with social programs and natural re-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS sources. In addition, the agency will be responsible for projecting the economic impacts of current and projected needs and recommendations, and will be re(cid:173)quired to report annually to the Presi(cid:173)dent, to Congress, and to each instrumen(cid:173)tality of Government. The intent of my bill will be to direct all of the long-range planning, which currently is or should be within the framework of the Federal Government, to the responsibility of one Federal agency. I would expect this agency to undertake and conduct a study of long-range needs of the American people and to make rec(cid:173)ommendations according to the scope of existing and projected resources which are or will be available, and with em(cid:173)phasis on the impacts upon the econ(cid:173)omy of those studies and recommenda(cid:173)tions. ARLIE EWING OF RETAIL CLERKS TO RETffiE HON. GLENN M. ANDERSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, March 21, 1974 In Mr. ANDERSON of California. Mr. Speaker, on March 28, 1974, the many friends of Arlie 0. Ewing will be honor(cid:173)ing this fine American upon his retire(cid:173)ment as president of Retail Clerks Union, Local 1442 of Santa Monica, Calif. I am honored that I might be able to share in this tribute befitting a man who has given so much of himself for the benefit of his fellow man. Settling 40 years ago in the San Joaquin Valley, Arlie Ewing worked for DiGorgio Winery as a refriger81tion en(cid:173)gineer. Here he became very concerned for the welfare of his fellow workers and became very much involved in the orga(cid:173)nized labor movement. Through his tire(cid:173)less efforts as an avid organizer, he helped membership grow through con(cid:173)tract development. fact, as was brought out in a meeting of the State Federation of Labor in 1957, Arlie was responsible for getting the first contract with DiGorgio Winery in 1937. Later, Arlie 0. Ewing and his family moved to Redondo Beach where he ap(cid:173)plied his time and talent in numerous civic activities. He has been an active member of the retail clerks since 1950. In addition to serving for the past 10 years as presi(cid:173)dent of local 1442, Arlie Ewing has also served for many years on the State council of the retail clerks. He has also been a very active member of the Democratic Party serving as president of the North Redondo Demo(cid:173)cratic Club for many years, chairman of the 67th Assembly District for four terms, and chairman of the 17th Con(cid:173)gressional Democratic Council for four terms. In addition, he has served as a member of the Los Angeles County Dem(cid:173)ocratic Central Committee for 15 years, and has for four terms been a member of the State committee. A true civic leader, Arlie Ewing has been involved in numerous community affairs. He has served for several years March 22, 1974 as chairman of the budget and finance committee of the city of Redondo Beach; has held the office of vice president of the Food and Drug Council; and has served on State committees. Currently, Arlie is serving as a member of the har(cid:173)bor commission in Redondo Beach. Mr. Speaker, we are fortunate in southern California that we have indi(cid:173)viduals like Arlie 0. Ewing who are will(cid:173)ing to give of themselves for the benefit of their community and fellow man. I know that his wife Jessie and his chil(cid:173)dren-Glen, Wayne, and Margaret-(cid:173)share in the pride we have for this great humanitarian. ARCHER TEXAS EASIER FULLINGIM POLITICIANS RETffiES; BREATHE HON. CHARLES WILSON OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, March 21, 1974 Mr. CHARLES WILSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I do not guess it is very often that a Member will rise in these chambers to pay homage to someone who has slandered him. We are all accustomed to having our egos trampled, of course, but that does not mean we should do honor to the tramplers. Archer Fullingim, though, is a far cry from your standard, run-of-the-mill ego-trampler. For 22 years now, Archer has been put(cid:173)ting out a little weekly paper in a little town named Kountze, and there prob(cid:173)ably has not been a year when he could not count almost as many libel suits as paid advertisers. That does not mean he is irresponsible or unfriendly or any(cid:173)thing; he just believes in getting things off his chest and letting you know whose newspaper it is you are reading. That the Kountze News belongs to Archer is a fact nobody has ever seen fit to challenge. He turns it out every Tues(cid:173)day on a cranky, wheezY old flatbed press that looks like something Gutenberg im(cid:173)proved on, talking to it and tinkering with it till it agrees to meet him halfway. In the process, that old press gets two things from Archer that no Texas poli(cid:173)tician in the last 22 years has been able to get: flattery and compromise. In between his various cantankerous campaigns and crusades, Archer has found time for his other interests as well. He is a yarn-spinner and shirt-cuff rac(cid:173)onteur without par, and he makes some(cid:173)thing called Mayhaw Jelly that you would swear was a collaborative effort between Mother Nature and Sardi's. Archer has also fallen in love with the pine bogs and backwoods of the Big Thicket Wilderness, and he will tell you with a straight face that he can talk to the trees. And you cannot help but believe him. He looks like he probably can, tall and angular and all, about as gnarled and ageless as some king cypress hidden off in a timeless corner of the thicket wilds. At any rate, Archer has decided to quit the newspaper business. That is probably going to make the world safer for a lot ",

The agency would also have to project the impact of the nation's largest strip mine, created to feed the plant 10.7 million tons of coal a year. The Federal Power Commission decided in September that it should not be the agency making such judgment. While El Paso's gas would be \"molecularly identical\" with the natural gas the FPC is obliged to regulate, the agency reasoned, it still would be syn(cid:173)thetic gas and therefore \"artificial\" and not subject to federal natural gas laws. With the ruling, the FPC confined its en(cid:173)vironmental studies to the impact of a valve, 2.3 miles away from the plant, where the coal gas would merge with El Paso's natural gas pipeline system. The job of assessing the impact of El Paso's plant, required under the National Environ(cid:173)mental Protection Act, has devolved upon the Interior Department, one of the agencies responsible for pushing Project Independ(cid:173)ence.

Settling the environmental issues would not be an easy task. The Navajo land is ex(cid:173)tremely dry, averaging around five inches of rainfall annually. El Paso proposes to restore, seed and irrigate the mined area and to fence it off until there is enough vegetative cover to permit grazing. According to voluminous study of Western coal lands, done last year by the National Academy of Sciences, no one has yet proven that large scale revegetation can be done on such arid land. According to Kelly Janes, section chief of an Environmental Protection Agency task force which has begun to study gasification processes, the Lurgi system used in Europe :Will pose air and water pollution problems. While, as Janes points out, the problems \"are not insoluble,\" the problem's environ(cid:173)mental impact should have been under study \"years ago,\" he asserts. Accurate studies take time. At best, he says, EPA will be able only to come up with a quick \"paper study\" on the possible envi(cid:173)ronmental impacts of the plant. \"There are a lot of questions here that will have to be answered,\" concluded Janes. Meanwhile, at the Interior Department, officials are drawing up plans to subsidize the El Paso project and other \"pioneer\" synthetic fuel ventures to get them going in time to help Project Independence. According to Interior's Dr. Gause, the El Paso project could provide a kind of national learning experience. \"We would learn a lot if some of these were built. We won't know what all the environmental effects are until we get it all up,\" he told a reporter. [From the Washington Star-News, Mar. 12,1974] FOR THE COAL INDUSTRY, FEDERAL RESURRECTION (By John Fialka) When it comes to multi-billion dollar fed(cid:173)eral \"crash\" programs, Project Independence promises to be unique: It will give American taxpayers something they can personally see, feel and smell for years to come. The \"crash\" development of atomic bombs and space vehicles took place in guarded uni(cid:173)versity buildings and on isolated military bases. But Project Independence-President Nixon's proposal to make the nation self sufficient in energy by 1980-will leave visi(cid:173)ble impacts all across the nation. Underneath the rhetoric, the plan really calls for the federal government to resurrect the nation's coal industry-a job that will be fraught with staggering costs and social, scientific and technological problems. In(cid:173)evitably, it will leave environmental scars on the nation's land and air quality. \"We are undertaking a crash program now and we estimate that we might be able to replace as much a& 3 million barrels per day of oil with synthetic fuels made from coal,\" William E. Simon, head of the Federal En(cid:173)ergy Office, told officials of oil-consuming na(cid:173)tions at an energy conference here last month. \"The coal industry probably must double its output by 1980,\" Simon told a congres(cid:173)sional committee a few days earlier, pointing out that 602 million tons of coal were mined last year compared to a peak 630 million tons in 1947. Teams of officials from Simon's FEO and other energy-related agencies now are strug(cid:173)gling to back up the rhetoric with a variety of proposals that must be approved by Con(cid:173)gress if Project Independence is to become something more than a phrase. \"They all seem to have one thing in com(cid:173)mon,\" remarked a senator who had seen some plans now privately circulating among gov(cid:173)ernment agencies. \"They'll all seem unbeliev(cid:173)able!' One that reportedly made a strong im(cid:173)pression on Simon came from the pen of Dr. Henry R. Linden, director of Institute of Gas Technology. That is an arm of the Amer(cid:173)ican Gas Assoc., the lobby and trade associ(cid:173)ation for the natural gas industry. Last year, Linden, who is one of the most respected figures in energy industry research and development circles, took part in a task force that estimated there might be as many as five plants making synthetic gas from coal by 1980. After the October Arab oil embargo, Lin(cid:173)den wrote a different scenario, based on an all-out \"crash program\" approach, similar to the one that produced the atom bomb. After including every \"doable\" way he could think of to increase U.S. oil and gas production, Linden found that there was still a \"great deficit\" between his number and the ideal of self-sufficiency in energy by 1980. To fill in the gap, he proposed that the government subsidize the construction of 41 synthetic fuels plants by 1980, including 5 shale oil plants and 36 plants that would make gas, oil and gasoline and methanol from coal. Linden's plan assumed that the plants would be built by private investors attracted by a \"carrot-type\" federal program guaran(cid:173)teeing product prices once the plants were built. How much would the \"carrot\" cost? Lin\u00b7 den has no precise estimate but he. regards as \"not out of line\" a Commerce Department study carrying a maximum price tag of $98 billion over 14 years. Commerce's scenario is slightly different, it calls for 37 synthetic fuel plants by 1980, in(cid:173)cluding 26 coal gasification plants. Both Lin(cid:173)den's and Commerce projections would rely heavily on the use of German proces~es, some of which have been used in Europe since before World War II. How would the subsidy mechanism work? The Interior Department is working on a third study that would have the government make bids on synthetic fuel at a price that would attract private investors' money to build synthetic fuel plants. There could be four to six plants by 1980, according to the plan. The government would turn over the fuel it bought to the Defense Department which uses considerable fuel. William Vogely, acting deputy assistant secretary at Interior for energy and minerals, said the subsidy might be used to aid the first proposed synthetic gas plant. El Paso Natural Gas Co. wants to build the plant in New Mexico and is asking the Federal Power Commission to set a rate for its gas-from(cid:173)coal that would put all the costs on its con(cid:173)sumers. is Total costs for the whole program could run as high as $360 million per year, accord(cid:173)ing to Vogely, if fuel prices reverted to levels when there was no embargo. If prices sta-yed high, government costs would be lower be(cid:173)cause private buyers would be competin;s for the fuel. \"Our position is that Project Independence must be defined as a program and not an idea. Interior is going to play a very major role in this,\" Vogely added. According to Robert Shatz, a former aero(cid:173)space engineer working under Simon at the Federal Energy Office, there are now \"seven or eight\" different scenarios under study. Shatz' office, picking the best elements from each, expects to deliver a final draft of Project Independence to Simon within three months. Shatz said he has a task force studying various subsidy proposals, but has no firm estimate on how much such a program would cost taxpayers. Even if it cost $10 billion a year, he pointed out, the only alternative would be to buy increasingly larger volume of imported fuel at \"several times\" that cost. The big numbers now being uttered around Washington have amazed some industry ex(cid:173)perts, men who have watched the coal in(cid:173)dustry languish for years. \"There are going to be large winners and big losers in this. The political forces now working in this thing are enormous,\" said one man involved in the decision-making. Some of the potential \"winners,\" however, are not so sure. \"Up to now, all I am getting from the government is rhetoric,\" complains Carl E. Bagge, who as president of the Na(cid:173)tio~al Coal Association is the coal industry's chief lobbyist. Bagge admits that one of the reasons fed(cid:173)eral subsidies are needed now that the coal industry, over the years, has contributed very little toward research and development. But coal, he argues, has been the \"red(cid:173)headed stepchild of the energy business,\" the chief victim of government tax breaks favor(cid:173)ing oil and pollution controls. \"Only five of the top 15 guys (coal companies) made a profit in 1973,\" he asserts. The continuing slump in coal development also has been reflected by a lack of interest in the nation's mining schools. There were only 200 mining engineers graduated last year, according to Bagge, \"a drop in the bucket\" compared with demands envisioned by Project Independence. \"If we ever get going, the industry would gobble up these guys overnight.\" Then there is the identity crisis the coal industry has. Of the top 10 coal production companies, the biggest is owned by a copper company, two are owned by steel companies, three are owned by oil companies and the rest are controlled by diversified conglomer(cid:173)ates with interests far beyond the coal in(cid:173)dustry. Major newcomers to the industry, now com(cid:173)peting for coal lands in the West, include several more oil companies, gas companies and giants from the electric utility industry. \"In a way, it's mind-boggling to ask us to move together,\" Bagge adds. \"All this stuff that the public is being mesmerized with now. Liquefaction and gasi(cid:173)fication. You're not going to solve the prob(cid:173)lem by throwing billions into coal research and development overnight. Behind all of that there has to be an economically viable industry.\" Bagge's solution is to have Congress pass a package of legislation guaranteeing coal's long-term stature as the nation's \"mother fuel.\" Included would be permission for wide(cid:173)scale strip mining in the West and a long(cid:173)term relaxation of air pollution controls that inhibit the burning of coal by electric util(cid:173)ities in the East. So far, despite vigorous verbal pressure from Simon and other government officials, even utilities that can burn coal have re-",
            "1004": "8060 CONTROVERSY AND RASH OF AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 69 HON. DAVID C. TREEN OF LOUISIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, March 25, 1974 Mr. TREEN. Mr. Speaker, the monu(cid:173)mental problems resulting from Federal involvement in elementary and sooond(cid:173)ary education are demonstrated by the rash of amendments to H.R. 69, and by the continuous controversy over funding which has embroiled almost every Mem(cid:173)ber of the House for years. I feel strongly that the time has come to do what many members are convinced must be done: Be.gin extricating the Fed(cid:173)eral Government from the malaise by re(cid:173)turning responsibility for elementary and secondary education to the States and local school authorities. I propose to diminish-and later eliminate-Federal funding of ESHA ti(cid:173)tle I programs and at the same time pro-to EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS vide the States a source of revenue to make up for the reduction in Federal spending. My proposal involves two steps: First. An amendment to be offered to H.R. 69 this week which will impose a $500,000,000 ceiling on ESHA title I pro(cid:173)grams for fiscal year 1976. The funding anticipated for fiscal year 1975 will not be affected. The amendment will also termi(cid:173)nate ESHA title I programs on June 30, 1976. However, an automatic extension for 1 additional year would still be pos(cid:173)sible under section 404 of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U.S.C. 1221. Second. Passage of legislation which will terminate the Federal excise tax on tobacco, thus providing a tax revenue source for the States to increase its fund(cid:173)ing of educational programs. The tobacco tax would terminate on June 30, 1975. Thus, for the year beginning July 1, 1975, the States would have a revenue source which amounted in fiscal year 1973 to $2,276,951,000, and which will amount to an estimated $2.3 billion for (In millions of dollars) March 25, 1974 fiscal year 1974, plus the sum of $500 million under H.R. 69 as amended. Every State-except my own State of Louisiana and the States of Mississippi and Kentucky-would have a greater funding level under this proposal. The following chart-attachment No. 1-shows how each State would fare under my proposal. It is anticipated that the $500 millon Federal funding would either terminate with fiscal year 19\u00b776 or be continued at a reduced level de(cid:173)pending on the extent of tobacco tax revenues. I call this plan revenue source return(cid:173)ing. It has obvious advantages over rev(cid:173)enue sharing. A summary of the advan(cid:173)tages of this proposal is found in attach(cid:173)tachment No. 2. ~The first step of this proposal, a bill to repeal the Federal excise tax on ci(cid:173)gars, cigarettes, cigarette papers, and tubes will be introduced tomorrow.

            "1054": "8110 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 2'6, 1974 offering a joint rate and through route. So long as no concerted action is involved, noth(cid:173)ing in this proposal would prohibit a single(cid:173)line carrier from individually establishing a rate competitive with a joint rate established through the rate bureau mechanism. Thirdly, nothing in the bill is intended to preclude discussions or agreements relating to across-the-board percentage changes in freight rates. Finally, the feature of this proposal that prohibits the Commission from approving rate bureau agreements that allow the rate bureau to protest or otherwise seek the suspension of an individual carrier's rate does not preclude one or more carriers from exer(cid:173)cising their right of petition under other pro(cid:173)vision of the Interstate Commerce Act and is not meant to repeal the decision of the su(cid:173)preme Court in Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc. 365 U.S. 127 (1961). To the extent that the anti(cid:173)trust laws are applicable in this area, how(cid:173)ever, this feature of the bill will permit their operation. ADEQUATE REVENUE LEVELS The bill amends section 15a of the Act by deleting certain ratemaking provisions found therein and consolidating those provisions in section 1(5) of the Act (section 2(b) of the bill). In addition, the bill provides that the Commission, in determining the adequacy of railroad revenues, shall prescribe uniform criteria for estimating the rate of return on capital, the impact of general changes in the level of prices on costs, and the adequacy of cash :flow. The bill also makes similar amend(cid:173)ments in sections 216(i), 307(f), and 406(d) of the Act to require the Commission to pre(cid:173)scribe uniform ratemaking criteria for motor carriers, water carriers and freight forward(cid:173)ers respectively. These changes in the existing law have been made to consolidate in one section the various standards applied by the ICC in de(cid:173)termining the reasonableness of individual railroad rates and to develop improved stand(cid:173)ards for determining adequate revenue levels for all modes. Improved revenue criteria will assist in developing a revenue policy which will enable the carriers to obtain a rate of return which is consistent with the degree of risk in the industry, and to a :flow of funds adequate to cover the projected costs of labor, capital, and other inputs, including the cost of money. Applying these criteria, the Commission will be in a better position to assess the economy and efficiency of railroad financial and operating management and thereby de(cid:173)termine the true revenue requirements of the industry. There are presently pending before the ICC a series of important cases regarding rail(cid:173)road ratemaking and revenue levels, Ex Parte 270, Investigation of Railroad Freight Rate Structure, Ex Parte 271, Net Investment(cid:173)Railroad Bate Base and Rate of Return, and 290, Procedures Governing Rail Carrier General Increase Proceedings. The Ex Parte Department has participated in these pro(cid:173)ceedings by filing comments and verified statements. In instituting these proceedings, the Commission recognized the need to de(cid:173)velop improved procedures and criteria with respect to determining what constitutes an appropriate freight rate structure and an adequate level of revenues. Unfortunately, these proceedings have not yet produced any final decision and, particularly in the case of Ex Parte 270, it does not appear that a deci(cid:173)sion from the Commission will be forthcom(cid:173)ing in the near future. Ex Parte 270 was in(cid:173)stituted on December 11, 1970, and on July 13, 1973, the Commission appointed a Commis(cid:173)sioner Coordinator for the investigation. The Coordinator has issued a status report, served on October 10, 1973, and instituted a series of subsidiary proceedings dealing with the issues of the uneven effects of general rate inc:.\u00b7eases on individual railroads and on in-dividual commodtties. Two other subsidiary cases, Ex Parte 270 (Sub-Nos. 1A and 1B). which deals with export and import rates for the Great Lakes and the Pacific Coast, and Ex Parte 270 (Sub-No. 2), which deals with the adequacy of railroad freight service, were earlier instituted by the Commission. The Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision in the investigation of export and import rates on November 26, 1973. While the Department fully supports the Commission's efforts to develop improved principles and procedures with respect to the adequacy of railroad revenues and the railroad freight rate structure, we believe that the basic change in underlying law is required as well. Both the progress and the outcome of the pending proceedings are un(cid:173)certain, and legislation offers the best pros(cid:173)pect for obtaining the basic ratemaking changes which are needed. UNIFORM COST ACCOUNTING The present cost accounting and revenue accounting system employed by the ICC is outmoded and inadequate. The Commis(cid:173)sion's cost system relies on broad averages rather than specific experience of individual carriers. Moreover, the accounting system from which the cost data are derived is based upon outmoded classifications and specifica(cid:173)tions that no longer relate to the carrier's actual financial transactions. In addition, the accounting procedures utilized are not ade(cid:173)quate to resolve the complex cost accounting problems which characterize modern trans(cid:173)portation firms. The development of improved cost and rev(cid:173)enue accounting procedures is absolutely essential to improved regulation of transpor(cid:173)tation. The bill would require the ICC jointly with the Secretary of Transportation to study and recommend uniform cost accounting and revenue accounting methods for rail car(cid:173)riers, and to issue regulations prescribing new uniform cost and revenue accounting methods within two years from the date of enactment of the bill. The Interstate Commerce Commission also has pending several proceedings dealing with the issue of developing an improved uniform cost accounting system, Docket 34013, Rules to Govern the Assembling and Presenting of Cost Evidence, and Docket 34013 (Sub-No. 1), Cost Standards in Intermodal Rate Pro(cid:173)ceedings. The proceeding in Docket 34013 was instituted by an order of the Commis(cid:173)sion dated April 16, 1962, and the Commis(cid:173)sion's decision was issued in 1970 (337 ICC 298). In February 1971, the Commission issued a new order reopening the case. The Department has participated in the main proceeding since 1968. Both the timing and outcome of the reopened proceeding are un(cid:173)certain. In the sub-proceeding, which was initiated in early 1969 after the Supreme Court's 1968 decision in the Ingot Molds case, the Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision on May 7, 1973. In sum, the bill would give direction and priority to the ICC's efforts to develop an improved uniform cost accounting system and would offer the best prospect for realizing this result. DISCRIMINATORY STATE AND LOCAL TAXATION OF INTERSTATE CARRIERS Discriminary taxation of interstate carriers by State and local governments is wide(cid:173)spread. As a result of State discriminatory taxation of railroad property, the railroad in(cid:173)dustry pays approximately $55 million an(cid:173)nually in additional taxes. Such discrimina(cid:173)tory taxation places an unjust burden upon these carriers and contributes to their fl.n'i\\n(cid:173)cial problems. The blll would prohibit dis(cid:173)crimination in assessing the property of in(cid:173)terstate carriers and in establishing tax rates for such property. The purpose of the provision is simpl:r to remove an inequitable burden from inter(cid:173)state carriers. Of course, any saving to the railroad and other interstate carriers from elimination of discriminatory taxation will remove a source of revenue from State and local governments. Removing this source of revenue abruptly could have a serious impact upon State and local budgetary planning and result in a substantial hardship. Therefore, the bill provides a three-year moratorium be(cid:173)fore compliance with its substantive provi(cid:173)sions will be required. This period should pro~ vide State and local governments ample time to make appropriate plans with respect to the potential revenue losses and temper any adverse financial effects the provision might otherwise have. SUBSIDIZATION OF GOVERNMENT SERVICE AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER SHIPPERS Under section 22 of the Interstate Com(cid:173)merce Act, Federal, State and local govern~ ments are currently permitted to negotiate rates with carriers and thereby to obtain rates below those which non-government shippers are required to pay. Such preferen(cid:173)tial treatment of governmental shippers is inherently discriminary. Governmental ship(cid:173)pers should pay their fair share of the Na~ tion's freight bill. The bill would require governmental ~hip\u00adpers to pay the same rates as other shippers, except on service performed in time of war or for transportation of commodities -vhich may be carried by motor carriers or barge lines exempt from economic regulations un(cid:173)der the Act. The \"time of war exception\" is provided because of the unique shipping re(cid:173)quirements and problems which exist \u00b7:1nder war conditions. The exempt commodities ex(cid:173)emption is designed to allow railroads to compete on an equal footing with barge lines and motor carriers for such traffic. By re(cid:173)quiring governmental agencies to pay the same rates as other shippers, the bill would eliminate the discrimination inherent in the present regulatory system. INTRASTATE RATEMAKING A significant loss of revenue to the rail~ road industry has resulted from the failure of State regulatory agencies to act more promptly to adjust intrastate rates in accord\u00b7 ance with the ICC approved changes in the level of interstate rates. The blll is designed to correct this problem by transferring ex\u00b7 elusive jurisdiction over intrastate rates to the ICC whenever State regulatory agencies have not adjusted appropriate intrastate rates promptly. Intrastate traffic accounts for about 12 J er(cid:173)cent of the total traffic carried by the rail~ road industry. As of August 1971, the revenue loss to the railroad industry because of State failure to adjust intrastate rates to the level of interstate rates approved in a series of ICC General Increase Proceedings (Ex Parte 256, 259, 262, 265, and 267) has exceeded $105 million, on a cumulative basis. The delays as(cid:173)sociated with adjusting intrastate rates in accordance with interstate rates approved in Ex Parte 281 as well as inaction on the fore(cid:173)going general increases have added substan(cid:173)tially to the above estimated revenue loss since August 1971. By depriving railroads of badly needed rev(cid:173)enues, these time lags adversely affect the financial condition of the railroad industry. In light of the serious financial difficulties facing the railroad industry today. it is im(cid:173)perative that intrastate rates be adjusted promptly in accordance with changes in thA level of interstate rates. In addition, the gen(cid:173)eral public is adversely affected by this regu(cid:173)latory lag because without these needed rev(cid:173)enues, the railroads' ability to provide serv(cid:173)ice and improve service to both intrastate and interstate shippers is impaired. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH LOAN GUARANTEES An efficient, financially sound rail system is a great national asset. Although the rail(cid:173)road system in the United States is experienc(cid:173)ing financial difficulties, it is neither dead nor dying. If the actions necessary to mod(cid:173)ernize both the regulatory framework and the physical plant are taken, the railroad indus(cid:173)try can be made financially sound. ",
            "1104": "8160 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 26, 1974 ultimately be moored offshore. The NRDC is concerned in part about the pressures that could be put on the coastal zone by a variety of poosible new activities, from the construc(cid:173)tion of FNP's and deepwater ports to the ex(cid:173)traction of minerals and oil and gas. The $210-million OPS facility, which may soon be under construction, is to consist of these major elements: ( 1) production shops to manufacture and assemble components and subassemblies; (2) a 450-foot-wide graving dock (drydock) in which huge barges, or floating \"platforms,\" will be assembled; (3) a wet slip into which the barges will be launched-the slip will have eight stations, and, as a new barge enters the slip, the others which preceded it will each advance one sta(cid:173)tion, assembly-line fashion; (4) a hugh gantry crane (with a span of 675 feet, a height of more than 300 feet, and a lifting capacity of 900 tons) that will be used to put the larger plant components in place; ( 5) a facility beyond the wet slip for test(cid:173)ing the FNP's (without nuclear fuel) as they emerge from the wet slip. The FNP's, if built, wlll be one of the strangest looking things ever seen at sea. The total structure, barge and power plant to(cid:173)gether, would be about 400 feet square, have a 32-foot draft (in salt water), rise 177 feet above the waterline, and have a displacement of 160,000 tons. It would contain quarters for 112 operating personnel, a crew roughly the size of that of some nuclear submarines. Each FNP, with a four-loop pressurized water reactor and steam supply system, would have a generating capacity of 1150 megawatts. Normally, two or more FNP's would be moored together in water of from 40 to 70 feet deep. They would be protected by a mas(cid:173)sive breakwater from storms and from ships that might stray off course. The breakwater, forming an envelope that covers about 100 acres, would encircle the FNP's completely except for two relatively narrow openings to permit the free circulation of seawater and allow service vessels to enter. The FNP sites must, at present, be within U.S. territorial limits, which extend 3 miles from shore. One reason for this is that the Price-Anderson Act, which in the case of a nuclea~r accident would limit the liability of priva\u00b7~e insurers a.nd the government to a total of $560 mlllion, genoo-ally applies only to accidents occurring within the United States. A FNP located even 2 to 3 miles offshore of(cid:173)fers certa.in clea.r a.dvantages over land-based plants in terms of day-to-day environmental effects and public safety. A land-based plant may preempt a sizable a-rea--indeed, at its Turkey Point plant below Miami, the Florida Power a.nd Liglht Company h8is built a harp-shaped grid of cooling canals th8it covers more than 6000 acres. Cooling towers are not especially demanding of 18ind, but they too exact certain penalties, as in the very power required to operate them. If, on the ather hand, closed-circuit cooling is not provided for a plant on a river, lake, or estuS~ry, the thermal effects on the aquatic biota can be disastrous. With the FNP, this dilemma is at least partly avoided because \"once-through\" cool(cid:173)ing with seawater can be employed without affecting a lagoon-like estuary or other con(cid:173)fined body of water. The temperature of the cooling water drawn through the FNP would be raised by t6 \u2022F, but, outside the pla.nt, the temperature rise would be confined to a rela(cid:173)tively few acres. Many small organisms such as fish eggs, larvae, and plankton would be killed by entrainment through the cooling system, but these forms are generally less abundant in the open sea than in biologi(cid:173)cally fecund estuairlne waters. In the case of existing nuclear plants, their surrounding \"exclusion area,\" where no hu(cid:173)man habitation is allowed, is reported to be seldom greater 'than % mile. Typically, the FNP would have an exclusion aree. of at least 2 or 3 miles wide, and, as will later be com(cid:173)mented upon further, th{lre seems no reason why-given the right legislative and engi(cid:173)neering remedies-this area should not be much wider still. The inception of the OPS is traceable to difficulties the Public Service Electric and Gas Company of New Jersey (PSE&G) began to encounter a few years ago in finding accept(cid:173)able nuclear plant sites. This utility, together with certain other utilities in the mid-At(cid:173)lantic region with which it shares electricity, foresaw a need to have eight nuclear units operating by the mid-1980's. But new en(cid:173)vironmental policies and regulations, such as those mandated by the National Environ(cid:173)mental Policy Act of 1969 and the Water Quality Act of 1970, could make it impossible to obtain government permits for power plants that would be in densely inhabited a.reas or that would degrade water quality or encroach heavily on coastal or riverine wet~ lands or beaches. Indeed, as the full implications of these new policies unfolded, PSE&G would, in 1973, abandon plans to build two nuclear units on Newbold Island in the Delaware River, in the densely urbanized region between Phila(cid:173)delphia and Trenton. The utility would adopt the alternative, recommended by the AEC regulatory staff, of building these units-at an added cost of some $60 mil(cid:173)lion-in a rural area near Salem, N.J., where PSE&G already has two other nuclear units that will go on the line within the next few years. (According to Ralph Nader, the site of the existing Salem units, 18 miles from the center of Wilmington, Delaware, is itself out of keeping with \"safe-siting guidelines\" prepared by the AEC regulatory staff but never made public.) In 1970, PSE&G asked Westinghouse, builder of the reactors for the first two units at Salem, to study the concept of offshore plants. This led to the 1971 announcement by Westinghouse and Tenneco of plans for their joint venture, OPS. By early 1972, :rBE&G had given OPS a letter of intent to buy the first two FNP's produced, and this was later followed by the negotiation of a firm contract (subject to adjustments re(cid:173)flecting rises in the cost of labor and mate(cid:173)rials) for the delivery of these units at a price of about $375 million apiece, or $750 million for the two. These first FNP's would be moored 2.8 miles off the New Jersey coast, at a point 12 miles northeast of Atlantic City and some 4 miles from the nearest resort village. PSE&G is responsible for constructing the breakwater and installing the underwater transmission cable by which power will be delivered to the mainland. The estimated total cost to PSE&G of the two FNP's is usually put at about $1 billion. The actual cost may depend to no small degree on what special safety features the AEC requires as a condition of licensing. But PSE&G is san(cid:173)guine enough about ultimate costs to have recently ordered two more FNP's, which the company believes can be bought and put in service at a price that compares favorably to that of land-based nuclear plants. These units are not necessarily destined for an open ocean site, however. PSE&G has indi(cid:173)cated that the FNP's may be placed at some inshore location instead, possibly in Dela(cid:173)ware River or Bay. OPS has been unable to start building its FNP manufacturing facility at Jacksonville until now because of delays in obtaining the necessary dredge and fill permits. It was not until 29 January that a U.S. District Court dismissed the Florida Audubon Society suit. Audubon apparently will appeal, but OPS officials have been confident enough about the outcome of the case already to have ordered the giant, $13-milllon gantr}' crane and even the fabricated steel for the first FNP hulls. to Besides believing that nothing will arise now to block construction of the production facility, OPS is counting on the AEC to is(cid:173)sue a license by the spring of 1975 for the manufacture of FNP's (the pending OPS ap(cid:173)plication for a manufacturing license is for eight FNP's, but company officials say the number applied for will soon be raised to 16). If the license is in fact forthcoming without delay the OPS schedule calls for de(cid:173)livery of the first FNP in 1979 and of the second in 1980. Once completely equipped and in full op(cid:173)eration, the OPS facility would turn out four, or possibly five, FNP's a year. Manufacturing time per unit is expected to decline from 50 months for the first FNP to 26 months for the eighth one as labor efficiency and pro(cid:173)duction techniques improve. Standardization and assembly-line methods would be the secret to this achievement, which would be dazzling indeed compared to the minimum of 60 to 72 months generally required build large nuclear plants. OPS is interested in eventually establishing manufacturing facilities to serve markets on the Pacific Coast, along the Great Lakes, and abroad. Delivery of FNP's from Jacksonville to the West Coast would not be practicable and has never been contemplated. Thus far, the only firm orders OPS has in hand are those for the four FNP's that PSE&G is buying. The municipally owned Jackson(cid:173)ville Electric Authority has given OPS a care(cid:173)fully hedged letter of intent to order two FNP's. Middle South Utilities, a holding com(cid:173)pany in New Orleans, also has under serious consideration the possibility of ordering two (in this instance, the FNP's would not be moored offshore, but well up the Mississippi River, below Baton Rouge). Most utility of(cid:173)ficials are content for PSE&G to be the first to put the FNP concept to a practical test. The AEC has, for its part, been generally supportive of the OPS project. John F. O'Leary, the AEC's director of licensing, has stated that, to judge from preliminary plans, the NFP con(}ept is \"feasible.\" The fact that the agency has even agreed to entertain an application for a manufacturing license is itself an innovation, for in the past the con(cid:173)struction of a nuclear plant could only be licensed on the site where the facility would be built and operated. A licensing procedure covering a number of nearly identical plants under construction simultaneously in a single shipyard-like facility would permit the AEC to carry out a more efficient and inten(cid:173)sive program of inspections than anything seen in the past. The utility buying a FNP also gains an advantage from this kind of licensing procedure. Even as the FNP is be(cid:173).ing manufactured, the utility applies to the AEC for an operating license and for per(cid:173)mission to build the necessary breakwater. \"I don't think there's any doubt but what they [OPS] will get the [manufacturing) license if they are willing to put in all the features we may require,\" says Edson G. Cook, deputy director of licensing at AEC. \"What they are gambling on is that the things required won't cost so much that it [the FNP] won't be economic.\" The AEC's requirements wm be established partly on the basis of highly detailed en(cid:173)vironmental reports. One such document re(cid:173)quired of OPS is a \"generic\" report on the FNP as installed and operated at various typical offshore sites. The report required of the purchasing utility has to do with the plant in relation to conditions at specific mooring sites. REACTOR SAFEGUARDS COMMITTEE Last October, the AEC's Advisory Commit(cid:173)tee on Reactor Safeguards ( ACRS) made a \"pre-application site review\" at PSE&G's re(cid:173)quest. From the committee's comments, one gets an inkling of the possible complications OPS and its customers may have to over(cid:173)come. For instance, the ACRS, although it might dismiss Henry Kendall's fears as to the ",
            "1154": "8210 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE March 26, 1974 just as the spoils system :finally sank of its own scandals, incompetence and cor(cid:173)ruption, and gave way to the appointed civil service based on merit we know to(cid:173)day, so the spoils system of private cam(cid:173)paign :financing is sinking under the scandal of Watergate, giving way to a new era of elected public service, based on public :financing of elections to pub(cid:173)lic office. It is clear, however, that public :financ(cid:173)ing is not a panacea for America's every social ill. It is not a cure for all corrup(cid:173)tion in public life. It is not a guarantee that those who enter public service will be any wiser in solving America's current problems. What it does mean is that public decisions will be taken in the fu(cid:173)ture by persons beholden only to the public as a whole, free of the abuses that have landed America in the dock in the eyes of democratic nations throughout the world, free of the appearance of spe(cid:173)cial influence and corruption that have done so much in recent years to bring all government to its present low estate. There are a number of issues which are being raised in connection with pub(cid:173)lic :financing, and which we will discuss in detail in the present debate. PAST ACTION BY THE SENATE ON PUBLIC FINANCING First, the bill is not being rushed through Congress prematurely. The principle of public :financing has received extensive analysis by Congress over many years, especially by the Senate. In fact, the present debate marks the :fifth year in the past decade in which the Senate is engaging in major floor debate on public :financing legislation: 1966 saw the birth of the original dol(cid:173)lar checkoff legislation, sponsored by Senator LoNG and signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson. 1967 saw that law delayed, caught in the crossfire of the then emerging pas(cid:173)sions over the 1968 Presidential election. 1971 saw the act revived, and again signed into law, this time by President Richard Nixon. And, in the wake of Watergate, 1973 saw the :first attempted extension of the checkoff to other Federal elections, in a measure passed initially by the Senate, but later killed by a Senate :filibuster mounted by those unwilling to let the majority work its will. There is a Rip Van Winkle tone to arguments of those opposed to public :fi(cid:173)nancing. We already have public :financ(cid:173)ing for Presidential elections. It is al(cid:173)ready a Federal law. It is already printed on the statute books. Surely, Congress is not about to roll back the clock on the dollar checkoff by repealing its provisions. The issue now is whether to extend the dollar check(cid:173)off, by applying its provisions to Pres(cid:173)idential primaries and to Senate and House elections. I say, if public :financing is the answer to the problems of private money and political corruption in Presidential elec(cid:173)tions, then it is also the answer to the problems of private money and political corruption in other Federal elections, too. If public :financing is good enough for President, it is good enough for the House and Senate, too. PUBLIC FINANCING IS NOT TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION Second, to those who say that public :financing of elections is taxation without representation, I reply that taxation without representation is what we have today, with a system of campaign :fi(cid:173)nancing that turns elected officials into vassals of their big contributors. If we want a President and Congress who represent all the people, then all the people have to pay the cost of their cam(cid:173)paigns for public office. Similarly, to those who say that pub(cid:173)lic :financing is a raid on the Federal Treasury by candidates for public office, I reply that the real raid on the Treasury is the raid that is going on today, the raid that is costing taxpayers tens of billions of tax dollars a year in undeserved priv(cid:173)ileges and benefits, bought by the private campaign contributions of wealthy do(cid:173)nors and special interest groups. Moreover, under the dollar checkoff method of public :financing now being widely used on this year's tax returns, it is clear that no one's tax dollars are being taken for public :financing against his will. No tax dollars go into the election fund at all unless a taxpayer checks the box on his return. If the dollar checkoff works, it means that every dollar in funds for public :fi(cid:173)nancing is coming from an individual taxpayer who has given his consent. That is a complete answer to those who say that taxpayers should not be forced to pay for political campaigns, and that public officials should not be spending public money on themselves. True, the new Senate bill would enable any deficits in the checkoff fund to be made up by congressional appropriations. But the allocation of tax dollars for :fi(cid:173)nancing elections is no different in prin(cid:173)ciple from the allocation of tax dollars for any other purpose. Not every citizen approves the way every tax dollar is spent. The most ob(cid:173)vious example is Vietnam-over a period of more than a decade, America poured more than a hundred billion tax dollars into the Vietnam war, over the continu(cid:173)ing opposition of what began as a small segment of the population, but :finally became a majority of Congress and the Nation. To some, public :financing of elections may not be the most desirable use of pub(cid:173)lic dollars. But it is a vast improvement over private financing. We do not let wealthy private citizens pay the salaries of the President and Senators and Congressmen. Why should we let wealthy private citizens pay the cost of their campaigns? As with many other Federal spending programs, some citizens may oppose the way Congress decides that particular tax dollars shall be spent. But to call such spending \"taxation without representa(cid:173)tion\" is a distortion of one of democracy's greatest principles and a travesty on one of America's proudest slogans. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF PUBLIC FINANCING The third important issue concerns the questions that have been raised about the constitutionality of public :financing. I believe that the language of the Constitution and a long line of prec-edents in the Supreme Court, going back to the 19th century, establish ample authority for Congress to enact this legislation. In each of the major areas where :first amendment and other constitutional overtones are present, especially in the treatment of minor parties and the gen(cid:173)erous role carved out for independent private spending, the Senate bill pro(cid:173)ceeds with clear regard for basic legal rights. No one-no candidate or contributor(cid:173)has a constitutional right to buy an elec(cid:173)tion. To suggest that Congress cannot enact this measure is to deny democracy the right of self-survival. Surely, with 535 experts preeminent in the :field, Congress has the constitu(cid:173)tional power to correct a clear and pres(cid:173)ent evil it recognizes in the arena of elections. To paraphrase the famous words of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, challeng(cid:173)ing Supreme Court decisions thwarting progressive social legislation at the turn of the century, the Constitution does not enact Mr. Herbert Kalmach's political ethics. And so, I am confident the Supreme Court will uphold the pending legislation if it passes Congress and a challenge is ever brought. THE ROLE OF POLITICAL PARTIES UNDER PUBLIC FINANCING Fourth, contrary to the premature obituaries being offered, public financing is not a nail in the coffin of the two-party system in America. It will not diminish in any substantial way the role of polit(cid:173)ical parties in the Nation. To the extent that public funds go to candidates themselves instead of to the parties, the Senate bill simply reflects the existing reality of campaign spending, in which the role of the candidate is and must be paramount. Congress settled this issue in 1967 and ratified it again in 1971, and that is where it rests today. In two of its provisions, moreover, the Senate bill specifically enhances the parties' role: By conferring independent spending authority on party committees at the National and State level, over and above the candidates' own spending limits, the bill establishes a specific role for the parties in their own right, free of the candidates' control. And, by prohibiting expenditures over $1,000 by a candidate for President un(cid:173)less the expenditure has the approval of the party's national committee, the bill guarantees a substantial supporting role for the parties in the national campaigns. On balance, therefore, far from dam(cid:173)aging the parties, the prospects are good that public :financing will in fact be a useful counterbalance to the forces driv(cid:173)ing the two-party system apart and splintering modern politics. Realistically, public financing by it(cid:173)self is not a lever strong enough to re(cid:173)juvenate the political parties in America. But if that is the direction in which the larger political and social forces now at work are moving, then public financing will contribute significantly to the goal. ",
            "1204": "8260 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE March 26, 1974. appropriation bill we were up to our knees in title I tables, and I am sure my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee have been up to their armpits in them. And, I am pleased as well, that the President is putting the pressure on us with his forward funding proposal. If the Congress can take some constructive ac(cid:173)tion with this legislation, with program consolidation, we may be able, in coop(cid:173)eration with the administration, to give local school districts something they may find of more value than anything else we could do with or to title !-for(cid:173)ward funding, which would allow them, finally, to more fully utilize the title I money they receive by knowing in ad(cid:173)vance what they will receive and being able to plan on those funds as a hard item in their budgets. Now, with that said, I am going to have to say, too, that I have some real prob-' lems with H.R. 69, the committee b111. Of course, it is a practical impossibility to put together a title I formula that will please everyone, or perhaps even a ma(cid:173)jority. But, while the committee, on the face of it, appears to have done a pretty good job of putting together a formula that seems to help most and hurt as few as possible, they have incorporated some \"sleepers\" that are going to wind up se(cid:173)riously affecting a number of States over the long haul. They have gone to the Orshansky poverty definition in lieu of a strictly low(cid:173)income :figure based on the census, and they propose to count only two-thirds of the AFDC children above the Or(cid:173)shansky level-this because they main(cid:173)tain that the heavy reliance of the pres(cid:173)ent formula on AFDC has skewed the allocation of funds heavily in favor of the wealthier States in the country. There is, of course, some truth in this latter contention, but moving to the Orshanksy-AFDC combination as they did will almost certainly result in skew(cid:173)ing the allocation drastically the other way. First, a basic flaw in the Orshansky index was pointed out by the originator of the index herself before the special Education Subcommittee. Mollie Orshan(cid:173)sky told them this measure-. . . concentrates on the income-food re(cid:173)lationship, although for urban families, par(cid:173)ticularly those handicapped not only by lack of money but by minority status and large families, the cost of housing may be critical-further analysis of the formula should be conducted before it is used as a poverty index. Orshansky does not include such ex(cid:173)penses as housing, transportation, medi(cid:173)cal care or taxes, which are pretty im(cid:173)portant measures of the cost of living. A Library of Congress study also pointed this out: The poverty levels are not varied to the different costs of living in different parts of the United States. The result of this lack of cost-of-living differentiation is that, relatively speak(cid:173)ing, the Orshansky index tends to under(cid:173)state poverty conditions in high cost-of(cid:173)living areas and overstates poverty con(cid:173)ditions in low cost-of-living areas. Second, the Orshansky index calls for the use of the Consumer Price Index to update income levels annually. Therefore the income levels in the Orshansky in(cid:173)dex will increase yearly with inflation. The committee formula counts only two(cid:173)thirds of the children from AFDC fami(cid:173)lies with incomes above the index. As the Orshansky poverty level increases yearly, the AFDC count above these lev(cid:173)els will not increase at the same pace and consequently decline. The Orshan(cid:173)sky index is estimated to increase about 10 percent this year. The Illinois Depart(cid:173)ment of Public Aid indicates that no AFDC payments have been increased yet this year, and a 3-percent increase is tentatively budgeted for this fall. Since 21 percent-or $18,122,680-of the Illinois title I LEA allocation is based upon the AFDC count of eligibles, the State would start to lose dollars the first year the Orshansky index is updated by the Consumer Price Index. Twenty-five percent-or $13,216,744-of the Cook County allocation is based on the count of AFDC eligibles. Sixteen percent of the 18th Congressional District's LEA al(cid:173)location is based on the AFDC count of eligibles-19 percent of Peoria's alloca(cid:173)tion. Now, the problem is, if you do not go with the committee, where do you go? Several Members, including myself, have tried to develop alternatives to what the committee has done. My friend and colleague from New York <Mr. PEYSER) has developed some fixed-formula pro(cid:173)posals which attempt to deal with these problems, but his 100-percent hold(cid:173)harmless provisions tend to negate the whole objective of devising a new for(cid:173)mula. Mr. O'HARA has a formula based on two-thirds school-aged population and one-third committee formula. This tends to put the money where the kids are, but leaves some large metropolitan areas such as Chicago, Los Angeles, and Detroit, among others, on the short end. A further problem with the formula of the gentleman from Michigan is that it has been equated with general aid, largely because of the gentleman's views that the title I programs should be di(cid:173)rected toward the needs of all children who are having learning difficulties with(cid:173)out regai\u00b7d to the income of the child's family-a view that has some real merit. In that vein, I would just point out that H.R. 69 does have a provision allow(cid:173)ing local school districts the option of using criteria other than poverty as a basis for distributing title I funds among schools. The amendment I had been exploring would use a two-thirds/one-third for(cid:173)mula mechanism without going so far as to adopt a general-aid approach, al(cid:173)though it would not change the local(cid:173)option provision in the committee bill either. It would change only the formula on which title I funds are distributed by basing two-thirds of the allocation on the school-aged population in local school districts, and one-third on the number of children from families with incomes below $3,500 plus the number of AFDC children above $3,500. The thrust and purpose of H.R. 69 would remain un(cid:173)altered, but the metropolitan areas which came down under Mr. O'HARA's formula would be brought back up, and the prob(cid:173)lem of AFDC attrition would be elimi(cid:173)nated. In view of the lopsided votes on the O'Hara and Peyser amendments, I have no illusion that my amendment would fare any better so I shall not put it to a vote, but did want to have my position made clear by way of these remarks. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment to the committee sub(cid:173)stitute offered by the gentleman from illinois (Mr. MICHEL). The amendment to the committee sub(cid:173)stitute was rejected. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. TREEN TO THE COMMITTEE SUBSTITUTE Mr. TREEN. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment to the committee substitute.

Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will count. One hundred and two Members are present, a quorum. Mr. TREEN. Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, the substance of my proposal is printed in the RECORD today on page 8060, and there is a chart on that page which indicates what my pro(cid:173)posal would do with regard to funding. My proposal is in two parts, only one of which could be effected here. First of all, let me explain why I am making this proposal. It has been said by one of the Members here that this is not the time to debate whether or not the Federal Government should be involved in education. I dis(cid:173)agree with that. I think now is the time that we should debate the basic question of whether the Federal Government should continue to be involved in edu(cid:173)cation. I think that the monumental problems that have been demonstrated by the rash of amendments that we have to H.R. 69; by the continuing controversy we have had over the years on the level of appro(cid:173)priations, on the formula for spending, and many other controversies that we are going to have on H.R. 69 before we get to a final vote, demonstrate that we ought to look at the question of whether or not this Congress should be involved in elementary and secondary education. Mr. Chairman, I think the time has come to extricate ourselves from this mailaise by returning responsibility for elementary and seconda.ry education to the States and to the lor.al authorities. ",
            "1254": "8310 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE March 26, 1974 tee informant. However, he added, political pressures could force an earlier committee vote. Complicating the situation is the possibil(cid:173)ity that the committee may wind up in a time-consuming lawsuit with the White House over the validity of its subpoenas. So far, the committee's approach to im(cid:173)peachment appears to have been sober and deliberate. One of its members, Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas, said during an interview telecast by the Educational Broadcasting Corp., \"I, as a Democrat, take no joy and no comfort in the prospect of having to vote on impeach(cid:173)ment of the president of the United States. That is not something any sane, rational per(cid:173)son who cares about the .Republic and how it stands could take joy and comfort in doing.\" PROTECTION FOR OUR NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. ~ORD asked and was given permission to extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and to include ex(cid:173)traneous matter.) Mr. MILFORD. Mr. Speaker, today I have introduced a resolution urging that the United States, as a national policy, make every effort to encourage and re(cid:173)quire the export of finished materials, rather than our basic natural resources. This Nation, so rich in natural re(cid:173)sources, currently faces shortages of such basic materials as copper, wheat, cotton, logs, fertilizer, petrochemical feedstocks, and others. Part of the reason is exports. These shortages have a twofold nega(cid:173)tive impact on our economy. They are cutting into our work force, which nor(cid:173)mally would be turning these basic re(cid:173)sources into finished products; and they are driving up consumer prices. This resolution would put the House on record as strongly favoring a policy to protect these vital natural resources until our own needs are filled. At the same time, it puts the House on record as strongly favoring an export policy which would encourage the export of fin(cid:173)ished products-manufactured by Amer(cid:173)ican workers. How many American millers would it have taken, how many hours of pay into American pockets, to convert last year's massive shipment of wheat to Russia into flour? How many American workers would have jobs if we were exporting finished lumber, plywood, or even completely fin(cid:173)ished products like furniture to Japan, instead of selling Japan logs off our taxpayer-owned lands? How many American textile workers would be on payrolls instead of unem(cid:173)ployment or welfare, if we were shipping cloth-or even thread-overseas, instead of raw cotton? And a lot of that cotton comes back to the United States as fin(cid:173)ished products, anyway. The primary purpose of this resolution is to put firmly on the record our na(cid:173)tional desire to protect our resources and make jobs for American workers. The secondary purpose of this resolu(cid:173)tion is to send a strong message to our colleagues in the Senate that the House meant what it said last September when it passed H.R. 8547, amending the Export Administration Act of 1969. That bill would write this concept into law. Unfortunately, consideration of that bill has been indefinitely postponed in the Senate. Mr. Speaker, I am not an isolationist(cid:173)far from it. I believe a healthy interna(cid:173)tional trade situation reinforces a healthy American economy. At the same time, though, I cannot see where the export of American raw materials and natural resources, coupled with the subsequent import of finished products from foreign manufacturers employing foreign workers, is of any benefit to the American economy. I urge the House to act on the resolu(cid:173)tion at the earliest possible time to un(cid:173)derscore strongly the fact that this body is serious about this concept. A GREAT MAN (Mr. PEPPER asked and was given permission to extend his remarks at this point in the REcoRD and to include ex(cid:173)traneous matter.) Mr. PEPPER. Mr. Speaker, a great man and a great American is a dear friend of my wife and myself and lives on Miami Beach. He is Baron Vladimir Kuhn von Poushental who was born in Russia of a distinguished family and fought in the White Russian Army during the Revolu(cid:173)tion. After the White Russian Army was defeated he fled to Ameria in 1918. His accomplishments in this country have been numerous and outstanding. The first I shall mention is his association with an old pilot friend and fellow Russian refu(cid:173)gee, Dr. George de Bothezat, who devel(cid:173)oped the first prototype helicopter. Dr. de Bothezat died in 1940. Recently, Baron von Poushental, who had been in busi(cid:173)ness with de Bothezat, collected and cata(cid:173)loged the latter's record and data con(cid:173)cerning the first prototype helicopter and presented all that invaluable material to the Superintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colo. The account of that presentation appears in a publication, Realtor, volume 40, No. 2, published January 8, 1973. This is such interesting aviation history that I know my colleagues and my fellow countrymen who read this record will be pleased to learn that long before the Sikorsky heli(cid:173)copter was developed this prototype heli(cid:173)copter of Dr. de Bothezat was developed with high efficiency. The second outstanding accomplish(cid:173)ment of Baron von Poushental was in the establishment of a Russian colony of White Russians in the vicinity of Rich(cid:173)mond, Maine. Baron von Poushental ac(cid:173)quired the land and provided for its acquisition by the White Russians and helped to develop a complete and suc(cid:173)cessful Russian colony with schools, churches, and other institutions reflect(cid:173)ing their ancient Russia of which these people of Russian background so vividly remembered and so much loved. This program of Baron von Poushental which led to the successful development of this great colony was also a momentous con(cid:173)tribution to our own country. In the Lewiston Evening Journal there is a very interesting article about Baron von Poushental's work in the establishment and development of this colony and re(cid:173):fiecting the great success of the colony. Mr. Speaker, I include the article to which I referred from the Realtor and the article to which I averted from the Lewiston Evening Journal about the Rus(cid:173)sian colony and also about Baron von Poushental presenting the papers of Dr. George de Bothezat to the Superintend(cid:173)ent of the U.S. Air Force ,Academy in the RECORD following my remarks. I also in(cid:173)clude, following these insertions, two let(cid:173)ters to Baron von Poushental dated Jan(cid:173)uary 28, 1972, and February 7, 1972, from the U.S. Air Force Academy, the first about the de Bothezat materials and the second about the Russian colony to which I referred: [From Realtor, Jan. 8, 1973] Baron V. Kuhn von Poushental, after the White Russian Army was defeated in the Crimea, fled to America in 1918 and quickly sought out his former pilot friend and fel(cid:173)low refugee, Dr. George de Bothezat. The lat(cid:173)ter was a mechanical genius who shortly thereafter was commissioned by the U.S. government to build a radical new aircraft, based on an aeronautical theory de Bothezat had evolved. The result--the prototype heli(cid:173)copter, built in 1922-llfted 4,400 pounds using a 170 horsepower engine. This was a ratio of more than 20 pounds per unit of horsepower, a.n efficiency of performance the Realtor\u00ae says he has not since been achieved. Following de Bothezat's death in 1940, Baron von Poushental, who had been briefly in business with the inventor, commenced collecting and cataloging the latter's records, consisting of four original manuscripts, eight typed scripts, 62 photos of the first helicopter flight and historical records of de Bothezat's private helicopter companies. The culmination of von Poushenthal's de(cid:173)votion to his friend and mentor came last August, when he was invited by the superin(cid:173)tendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy to present the de Bothezat materials for perma(cid:173)nent storage at the academy's library, where they are available for study by cadets, faculty and scholarly researchers. In a letter to the donor, Lt. Gen. A. P. Clark, superintendent of the academy, said in part, \"You may be sure these papers will be reviewed by cadets for years to come, for their historical significance as well as the unique record of one of our pioneers in aviation. The academy library and cadets are enriched by your generous contribution.\" [From the Lewiston (Maine) Oct. 21, 1972] Journal, RICHMOND'S TALENTED RUSSIAN COLONY (By Priscilla E. Braun) Richmond on the Kennebec is the hub of activity for the Russian people in the area. Four churches, a Russian restaurant, cobbler shop and a rest home are located in the village. How did a small Maine community happen to draw people from a completely different tradition? Baron Kuhn Von Poushental was on a duck hunting trek in this area about 1940. Bearing in mind the large number of Russian refugees nearing retirement he brought up land at bargain prices, advertised through the Russian language newspapers, and resold to those who yearned to spend their last years on their own land. The Richmond area bears a striking similarity the Russian countryside. People have settled throughout Whitefield, Dresden, Pittston, Bowdoinham, Litchfield, and Richmond. To group these people under the title \"Russians\" is inaccurate. They are usually victims of changing politics in Russia, Uk(cid:173)rania, Poland, Lithuania, and other iron curtain countries.

A couple from Hlniham wrote: When the Supreme Court decreed that abortion should henceforth be legal, we were stunned. Neither of us could believe that our country could sink to so low an evalua(cid:173)tion of human life. To deprive human beings of life without due process of law seemed so obviously against the Constitution. Another wrote: doctor from our district In the case of women desiring the end of unwanted pregnancies one is compelled to admit that the patient herself should have a choice. I have been il! mediicne just long enough to have dealt with a good many hun(cid:173)dreds of such women and am aware that the situation is generally complex and requires great tact. For some women there is no sub(cid:173)stitute for abortion. It has been, out of neces(cid:173)sity, required for me to send such patients to England in the past. Were backward steps to be made (imme(cid:173)diately) on the status of abortion we would once again be able to help the rich and not help the poor. And even the help to the rich would be second rate. I would like to add that I personally hope nobody in my family would need an abortion procedure. But I think they should have the right to have it even though I personally would not feel happy about it happening. Mr. Speaker, these are only a few of the many letters I have received on this subject. The diversity of opinion is very clear and very strong. Even our religious lead(cid:173)ers are divided. Consequently, I have al(cid:173)ways believed that this is a highly per(cid:173)sonal area in whicl). the government should not intervene. I do not, therefore, plan to support a constitutional amend(cid:173)ment to reverse the recent Supreme Court decision. As I }?.ave been telling my constituents who express their concern and ask that I support such a constitutional amend(cid:173)ment: \u00b7 I should like to tell you why I believe it best not to take this course. The proposed amendments to the Constitution are even more restrictive than our own former Mas(cid:173)sachusetts law-in that they would pro(cid:173)hibit the procedure in all instances whatso(cid:173)ever-even in the event of rape or incest, and possibly even in cases where the life of the mother is endangered by continuation of the pt;egnancy. As youl_nay know, this is a deeply person(cid:173)al and l'ftghly contrgversial area-with many sincere Americans holding strong convictions em both\u00b7 sides. At recent Senate hear).ngs, leaders of our major religions testified elo \u2022 quently on both sides. In such a situation, it seems to me wisest for the government not to intrude-but rather to leave the decision to the conscience of each woman and the judgment of her physician. Whlle I do not personally like the procedure of abortion, I do not believe that I should impose my views ~~~.others-nor should they !lP-pose th\u00a2rs on ; EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS The proper role of Congress, as I see it, .should be to ensure that no coercive laws on the Sllbject are enacted and that a new com(cid:173)mitment in programs and funds is imple\u00b7 mented to provide alternatives to abortion in the form of family planning, pregnancy coun(cid:173)selling, an(i humane foster child and adop \u2022 tion programs.

While we may not agree entirely on this issue, I assure you that I understand andre(cid:173)spect your point of view. I hope very much that we can all do the same for others with whom we may differ.

WAYNE OWENS OF UTAH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, March 26, 1974 Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, discussion often arises in Congress regarding the care and needs of our senior citizens. Among the foremost considerations in searching for a solution to the problems of the aged is returning these people to a life of dignity and quality, as well as a strong sense of usefulness. This is a problem of great importanc.e which we must face. It is no secret that for many of this Nation's elderly, retirement holds nothing more than dependence, anxiety, and loneliness. However, the picture is not all that bleak thanks to organizations such as Green Thumb, Inc., sponsored by the Na(cid:173)tional Farmers Union and funded by grants from the Labor Department. The Green Thumb program operates in 24 States, including my home State of Utah, and Puerto RicoL It is an employment project for senior citizens at the poverty(cid:173)income level. All Green Thumb workers must be at least 55 years old, have a low(cid:173)level income, have rural or farm back(cid:173)ground, and be in good health. There is no age limit. The oldest Utah Green Thumb worker is 97 years old. The average age of workers in Utah is 71.9. The workers have done a tremendous amount of work for the State of Utah on a volunteer basis. Green Thumb pays them from grant money, so that workers can earn additional income for food, medical care, and other necessities. Recently, Utah Green Thumb sent me a copy of their 1973 report. In the report was a copy of a letter from the family of the late Alden Miller, who had been a Green Thumb worker since 1968. The story related is typical of the immense benefits which Green Thumb employ(cid:173)ment has meant to many of our senior citizens. I insert this letter for the in(cid:173)formation of interested Members: NoVEMBER 30, 1973. Mr. JoHN ZuPKO, Green Thumb Project, Salt Lake City, Utah. DEAR Ma. ZuP~o: We, the family of Alden Mmer, would 11k'e to take this opportunity to March 26, 1971, (33 express our appreciation and gratitude to you and the Green Thumb Project {or the opportunities it opened up for Otlt b tlsband and father. .. Green Thumb meant a new life to him. It gave him independence in himself that he had never been able to express before. He was so proud of his work, his men, and the job that they were Cl.oing together. He en(cid:173)joyed the respons llity of his paper work and this gave hini self confidence when he realized that he could do it and was doing a good job. It was the first time in his life that his job was something special and people looked up to him for supervision. He was most proud that he was chosen to be foreman and he enjoyed working with his crew of men and they were so special to him. He was an intel(cid:173)ligent and alert man and Green, Thumb gave him a chance to prove this to himself and others. After working with the Green Thumb Project it was the first time he had been completely out of debt: He was able to save toward fixing up their home {which they had lived in for over 40 years). He and some of his sons were able to lay cement sidewalks all around their home and this was some(cid:173)thing that they had wanted for some time. They were able to buy some nice new modern chairs for their living room and at the time of his passing plans were being made by\u00b7 he and his wife to carpet and wallpaper some of the rooms in their home. Christmas of 1972 was the first time that he and his wife were able to save enough tnoney so that they could give ChriStmas presents to ALL of their family. What a thrill it was for them to give five dollar bills to each of their children and their spou-ses (J.6 total), silver dollars to each grandchild total), and silver dollars to each great grandchild ( 6 total) . December 20, 1972, our parents celebrated their 50th Wedding Anniversary. Daddy had saved the money and for Mother's ann!ver\u00b7 sary gift gave her 'fifty dollars. How proud he was that he had been able to save this amount out of his Green Thumb earnings for his companion of 50 years. . He was able to save some from each of his checks and had a sizeable savings account for the first time in his lii'e. He felt this was. a very good insurance to have this saved for a rainy day .. It was a big load lifted from his and his Wife's shoulders when they knew that there was a regular income check coming in each month. Our father was a kind and gentle man who had been poor and hard working all of his life. It was only after he started with the Green Thumb Project and had the financial load lifted that he had time to sit and visit with his friends and loved ones and enjoy life. . It made him so proud when he could go wlth friends or family and show them some of the accomplishments that he and his crew of Green Thumbers had accomplished. On a Sunday afternoon ride he was so proud to ~how you such accomplishments as the Pali(cid:173)sade Lake improvements, Fairview Museum, Manti Cemetery fence, Fountain Green Cemetery improvements, and many other various projects. The Miller Family feels Green Thumb was one of the most rewarding opportunities in our Father's life. What a wonderful program for older men to work in who would other(cid:173)wise think they had no meaning, place, or purpose in life. Green Thumb gives them the opportunity to prove they are important people and that they still have a useful place in life. With grateful hearts we want to take this opportunity to thank the Green Thumb Project and especially you-Mr. Zupko, for the confidence and responsibility you placed in our husband and father-Alden Miller. Be(cid:173)cause of yon and Green Thumb, in the last "

Rollcall No. 206-a motion to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendments to S. 1125, the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treat(cid:173)ment, and Rehabilitation Act. The mo(cid:173)tion carried 301 to 17, and the measure was passed. I was paired for this motion, and, had I been present, would have voted in favor of it. TAX BENEFITS AND TAPES (Mr. BINGHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re(cid:173)marks.) Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, accord(cid:173)ing to media reports, when President Nixon inaugurated the system of having tapes made of conversations in his office, he had in mind that at some subsequent time a gift of such tapes would be de(cid:173)ductible for tax purposes. If it is true that the law Congress passed eliminating tax deductions for papers and files, et cetera, does not in(cid:173)clude tapes, then the law should quickly be amended to correct that obvious loop(cid:173)hole, and I am introducing legislation to that effect today. RESIGNATION OF MR. JENNER CALLED FOR (Mr. LANDGREBE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANDGREBE. Mr. Speaker, it may not seem to be in good taste to bring to the floor intraparty squabbles. However, the magnitude of the present situation requires that I speak out. For more than a year now the Presi(cid:173)dent has been under vicious attack. That this biased and partisan attack comes in large measure from members of the Democratic Party is to be expected. That this attack in large part comes from all the various factions of the liberal-left, to overturn who are attempting the overwhelming election mandate of 1972, is also to be expected. That many mem(cid:173)bers of the Republican Party are ac(cid:173)quiescing, following along, and not standing up in defense of the President is reprehensible. I think it is inexcusable for Republi(cid:173)cans not to be def ending the leader of their party when he is being subjected to hostile and unjust attacks which are weakening and threaten to destroy our republican form of government with its system of checks and balances and sepa(cid:173)ration of power between the executive and legislative branch. Even though millions of dollars have been squandered in what has been to date a futile attempt to find an offense of an impeachable nature with which to hang our President, nothing of that na.(cid:173)ture has been brought to light. Consider, in this context, the actions of the minority members of the House Judiciary Committee. The very least that the President could expect is that the members of his own party leave no stone unturned to insure that he has a fair hearing. Thus the role of the Republi(cid:173)cans on this committee should be similar to that of a, defense attorney-continu(cid:173)ally subjecting the charges of the prose(cid:173)cution to close cross-examination. Therefore, it is important that the mi(cid:173)nority counsel on the Judiciary Commit(cid:173)tee be capable of standing up to the charges and attacks of the committee majority to insure that the impeach(cid:173)ment investigation is honest and just. The actions of Mr. Bert Jenner, as out(cid:173)lined in the following letter, make it clear that he is totally incapable of meet(cid:173)ing this challenge. I join my colleague, Representative LAWRENCE J. HOGAN, in urging Representative EDWARD HUTCHIN(cid:173)SON to request the resignation of Mr. Jenner as minority counsel on the Judi(cid:173)ciary Committee's impeachment in(cid:173)quiry. The letter follows: WASHINGTON, D.C., May 6, 1974. Hon. EDWARD HUTCHINSON, Rayburn Building, Washington, D.O. DEAR Eo: I strongly urge that you request the resignation of Bert Jenner as our Minor(cid:173)ity Counsel on the Judiciary Committee's Im(cid:173)peachment Inquiry. As we begin the most important part of our work, it is vitally important that we have reliable staff support. In effect, we do not have a Minority Counsel; we have an assist(cid:173)ant Majority Counsel. You will recall that a number of us on the Committee were upset over his lack of candor in not telling you before he was hired tnat he had contributed $1,000 to Senator Adlai E. Stevenson Ill's campaign and had participated in a fund-raising break(cid:173)fast. That could have been overlooked, but his subsequent activities I find inexcusable. We were also disturbed that, immediately after his appointment, he had gone on tele(cid:173)vision publicly stating his views on im(cid:173)peachable offenses. We later questioned his statement that the President can be im(cid:173)peached for acts of his subordinates as well as the appropriateness of his making such a statement publicly. You will recall that we chastised him in our caucus and told him that he had been hired to advise us, not to make public statements on impeachment. He assured us he would not do it again. In this context, I also quote from the \"Rules for the Impeachment Inquiry Staff\": \"1) The staff of the impeachment inquiry shall not discuss with anyone outside the staff either the substance or procedure of their work or that of the Committee.\" In spite of this rule and our specific in(cid:173)structions, he has traveled to various parts of the country making speeches on impeach(cid:173)ment. I previously called to your attention the article from the April 12, 1974 Austin reported on a speech Mr. Jenner made at the University of Texas Law School. The story was headlined: \"Watergate Grand Jury's Report 'Loaded'; Committee Lawyer Joyful at Issuance of Sub(cid:173)poena\". I quote from this news story: \"One of the handful of people who know what is inside a confidential report from the Watergate grand jury to the House Ju(cid:173)diciary Committee said in Austin Thursday 'it is Joaded.' \"As he spoke to law students at the Uni(cid:173)versity of Texas, Albert Jenner, minority counsel to the House committee, heard the news that the group had voted to subpoena all of the tapes and documents it has re(cid:173)quested from President Nixon. \"As he read a note slipped to him during his speech, Jenner raised his arm into the air, clenching his fist and said, 'it was is(cid:173)sued.' \"His announcement met with immediate cheering and applause. With a big smile on American-Statesman which his face, the attorney took off his coat, turned back toward the crowd and said, 'I've been working on that for months.' \"Before the interruption, Jenner had been telling the students of the many questions and problems that confront a lawyer placed in the position of heading up an impeach(cid:173)ment investigation. \"Sticking to the confidentiality rules adopted by the Committee, he made no com(cid:173)ments on a number of the more controversial issues involved in the case. \"He said if the President refuses to com(cid:173)ply with the subpoena, the House Will prob(cid:173)ably vote him in contempt. 'They will then bring to bear the judgment and anger of the people of the country and include the con(cid:173)tempt charge in the articles of impe.ach(cid:173)ment,' Jenner said. \"'In our opinion', Jenner said, speaking of the staff of 44 lawyers and 58 other work(cid:173)ers, 'we feel the President must be guilty of gross misuse of power' to be impeached. 'It must be extremely serious.' \"But, he said he doesn't feel the con(cid:173)stitutional statement that the President can only be impeached and convicted for 'trea(cid:173)son, bribery or other high crimes and mis(cid:173)deme.anors' means that impeachable offenses are limited to 'crimes.' \"'We feel it extends to serious abuses and offenses against the system of government in the United States of America,' Jenner said. \"Impeachment is an inquiry, not a trial, he told the students. 'It is a political func(cid:173)tion given solely to the House and . . . (by implication) gives the right to exercise any power to obtain information the House feels necessary to carry out the inquiry.' \" 'This is a Grand Inquiry, with a capital G and I,' Jenner said. And because of this, he said, he doubts the committee will com(cid:173)promise on the materials it seeks from the President .. .'' I not only object to his improper remarks in violation of our instructions and the Committee's rules, but also the fact that he has missed important committee meet(cid:173)ings and Republican caucuses, apparently because he was out of the city making speeches. I suggest that you ascertain if he is the anonymous \"source in Congress\" who was quoted in the Los Angeles Times March 23 as saying: \"'When you hear the tape,' one source said, 'you have a lot more respect for Dean's integrity and what he told the Senate Water(cid:173)gate committee. It is that explosive. It is not runbiguous.' \" I further question whether or not he should have met with editors of the Wash(cid:173)ington Star-News in an off-the-record session or whether he should talk to any media rep(cid:173)resentatives \"off the record\" or on. In a number of instances Mr. Jenner has impeded the work of Republicans on the Committee. You will recall that he supported the Majority's brief on impeachable offenses and when we learned in advance of the thrust of this brief, we asked him for a broader brief stressing criminality. He said he would have it prepared for us. I specifically re(cid:173)quested that we have this brief before, or at least at the same time, the Majority's brief was presented. I did not get it until several days after the Majority brief was made public and only after I specifically demanded it from Mr.Jenner. Obviously there are different legal views on virtually every legal principle, but we have been getting only one view because Mr. Jenner goes along with the Majority on all matters to the detriment of Republican members of the Oommittee. As you know we have requested Mr. Jenner to do research on a number of important matters and, as far as I can determine, this work has never been done.

Or program papers that on the face of it would indicate that Liddy was engaged in an eavesdropping operation and, you know, that Haldeman would have known about it? So he called and said something about it but that's yet another thing you've got to keep in mind. P. I don't (unintelUgible). K. I don't think so either. P.Huh? K. I don't think he did either. P. Haldeman could tell me though-he's a-I'm sure-Bob would tell me-he's a \"don't give a (expletive removed) kind of a guy\" anyway and Ehrlichma.n would tell me too. The deep six thing troubles me. Al(cid:173)though-what was that? Oh, I know what that could be-that could be-you see Hunt's operations before-that's what that ls. Hunt worked in the White House, you know, on some national security matters and I think that's what that's involved. Not the Water(cid:173)gate. K. Let's get back to this concept of the Presidency, sir. P. Right K. What you do is the right thing to do and then when having done it then it would be recognized as the right thing. P. Right. K. And I know-I don't know-but I be(cid:173)lieve-feel that we should have-I think the options that you have to consider there are two. One do you, the President, what I have told you today, that might be forthcoming. And before that comes out would you ask 'em to step aside until this whole thing blows over? If it all blows over-maybe you're not indicted or culpable. Finally you come back and they do wind up having been indicted, you at lea.st have off of your personal staff(cid:173)those people who are going to be involved in the criminal justice system. If you don't take that step, and I-really don't pretend to ad(cid:173)vise you on it sir-and then 1! it comes out, it's leaked out and then you've got to do it after the disclosure is ma.de publicly, you know, I think lt. P. Let me ask you this-tr it should come to a critical point-let us suppose-let's sup(cid:173)pose the worst. That it does-that it does come out on Haldeman and Strachan with his testimony that he had papers etc. The ques(cid:173)tion really is basically whether an individual, you know, can be totally, totally-I mean, the point is, if a guy isn't guilty, you shouldn't let him go. \u00b7 K. That's right-you shouldn't. P. It's like me-wait now-let's stand up for people 1! there-even though they are un(cid:173)der attack. K.Iknow. P. In H.a.ldeman's case though-I want to ask you-if you think-I just want to ask you your opinion. And the same on Ehrlichman based on this-do you think that-where he had no knowledge of Watergate. K.

You find-you find them guilty before they have a char..ce to prove their innocence, don't you? And another way you could do it is this-you could say if that question is raised, you could move them instantly. You see the point is that-you are suggesting I should do this based on information we have now. K. Which is not very good, precise. P. That's the point I am making-can on the basis of this kind of information. I don't suggest anything now-I'm K. just-P.

What effect does it have on the discharge of let's _say Bob's and Ehrllch(cid:173)man's duties as they'd be the object of spec(cid:173)ulation and attack in the press. What effect does it have upon their being able to dis(cid:173)charge their duties? P. Well one thing, of course, Bob could put it out first. K. The three fifty? P. Right.

I really think that's what he has todo. K. Have him appear before Jury? P. Will he be asked? K. No-except a punitive defense might ask him. P. (Unlntell1glble) here-you don't under(cid:173)stand (unintelligible). K. The prosecutor doesn't subpoena punitive defendant-his attorney doesn't-(cid:173)you know this stuff is going on-now does your guy want to come in and testify. P. You see, I realize that the fellows like up at the Ervin Committee and now the Grand Jury they're going to smash the likes of Haldeman all the time but you can't let a guy go-without a (unintelligible) if he's guilty, if you know he's innocent. K. Right. Let me say what I had to do with this Ha:i:ry Stewart. Remember the United States Attorney in San Diego? P. Yeah. K. Was involved in my confirmation hear(cid:173)ings. An allegation was made with respect to his obstructive conduct. It started as an administrative investigation by the FBI. While the investigation was going on, Harry Stewart just stepped aside as the United the Grand a in take on States Attorney. Then ultimately he went back. That whole judgment was a process on my part. P. Right. K. I sharply examined it and the hindsight of this stuff is fantastic. P. What's the name of your man Chicago? K. Barnabus Sears. P. I can sure get that down, but I'm going to get that U.S. Attorney in one way or another. K. And I've thought for months that some(cid:173)thing was wrong. P. Sorry to hear you say that. No-that's my problem-what to do. Poor (expletive removed)-they're all-they've got a right to a fair trial. K. I've tried about two or three thousand in the last twenty yea.rs and I did (unintel(cid:173)ligible).

            "104": "13966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE May 9, 1974 countries. PL 480 levels, according to officials at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, are be(cid:173)ing programmed for \"strategic security.\" Pri(cid:173)orities and commodity levels are being de(cid:173)termined by the National Security Council rather than the Agriculture Department or evenA.I.D. Faced with problems of commodity avail(cid:173)ability in the United States and dramatically rising prices, the Agriculture Department determined that there was no need \"to in(cid:173)crease the consumption of United States ag(cid:173)ricultural commodities in foreign countries,\" and hence submitted a request for a zero dol(cid:173)lar budget level for PL 480 in fiscal year 1975. In submitting a request for no PL 480 funds for the next fiscal year, the Agricul(cid:173)ture Department was merely acknowledging that no export commodities were needed to strengthen the commodity market in the United States. The Department was not try(cid:173)ing to do away with the program. However, many officials at the Agriculture Department are resentful of the PL 480 program in South Vietnam and Cambodia. They say that the White House agencies, primarily the National Security Council, are responsible for deter(cid:173)mining the size of the programs in those two countries and uses for which counterpart currencies may be used, while it is the Agri(cid:173)culture Department that \"gets the flack\" from Congress and the press for the pro(cid:173)gram's abuses. In past years PL 480 levels in Indochina were the result of input by three govern(cid:173)ment agencies. A.I.D. would submit its re(cid:173)quest for country needs based on requests from the recipient country and voluntary agencies, plus A.I.D.'s own assessment of in(cid:173)country commercial needs. The Agriculture Department would submit its request based on commodity availability and the need to stimulate U.S. markets. The Office of Man(cid:173)agement and Budget (OMB) would then de(cid:173)termine how much money was available for the entire program. A final program came out of an Interagency Staff Committee made up of representatives of the above department. Beginning in fiscal year 1974 a number of White House agencies were added to the de(cid:173)cision-making process, including the Coun(cid:173)cil of International Economic Policy and the National Security Council, to constitute what is referred to as the Augmented Inter(cid:173)agency Staff Committee. Department of Agri(cid:173)culture officials say, with some bitterness, that the White House agencies, with more prestige and influence, are now \"calling the shots.'' The widespread feeling among of(cid:173)ficials in the Agriculture Department who work on the PL 480 program for South Viet(cid:173)nam and Cambodia is that the Department is being used by the Administration as a conduit for commodities and funds in coun(cid:173)terpart currencies that serve a primarily strategic military purpose rather than a commercial or humanitarian purpose. USE OF COUNTERPART CURRENCIES South Vietnam and Cambodia, under Sec(cid:173)tion 104(c) of the PL 480 legislation, have been able to use 80 percent of the local (counterpart) currencies generated from the sale of Title I commodities \"to procure equip(cid:173)ment, materials, facilities, and services for the common defense including internal secu(cid:173)rity.\" In October 1973 an adjustment of the program was made by the Administration that increased South Vietnam's amount a.va.ila.ble for \"common defense\" to 100 per(cid:173)cent of the currencies generated from PL 480 Title I sales. Section 104(c) will make available $300 million in fiscal year 1974 for South Vietnam to use for \"common defense including in(cid:173)ternal security.\" South Vietna.m.'s cumulative total under section 104(c) is $1,200 million. Cambodia. in fiscal year 1974 is eligible for $155 million in \"common defense\" funds bringing its cumulative total to $199 million. However, Section 40 of the Foreign Assist-a.nee Authorization bill, signed into law De(cid:173)cember 17, 1973, provides language prohibit(cid:173)ing the expenditure of counterpart, PL 480-generated currencies unless such use is ex(cid:173)pressly authorized by Congress. Since the Administration has not come back to Con(cid:173)gress for such authorization, which they would have little or no chance of getting, the use of counterpart funds for military purposes must end by the beginning of fiscal year 1975, July 1, 1974. Most observers in and out of government feel that the July 1 dead(cid:173)line on Section 104(c) agreements1 is at leas\u00b7t in part responsible for the dramatic increase in Title I program totals for both South Vietnam and Cambodia. Section 104(c) essentially just writes off the debt incurred by the recipient countries in procuring PL 480 commodities. It allows South Vietnam and Cambodia to use the piasters and riels paid to them for PL 480 commoditie\u00b7s by local merchants to enlarge their military and police budgets. The new language in Section 40 of the Authorization bill means that the PL 480 debt may no longer be just written off. However, both South Vietnam and Cambodia will be eligible for very generous credit terms that provide for an initial 10 year period of grace on principle at 2 percent interest and 40 years in which to repay the \"loan\" at 3 percent interest. The effect of providing a. 10-year period of grace before repayment must begin will be to provide the governments of South Viet(cid:173)nam and Cambodia with a loan that may be used for \"development\" and general budg(cid:173)etary support. Thus freeing an equal amount of money that may be spent as the recipient governments see fit. An official in the Agri(cid:173)culture Department remarked, \"Once they have the commodities its their money.'' Be(cid:173)cause PL 480 monies are so fungible, the ef(cid:173)fect of the section 40 prohibition on their use for \"common defense\" will be negligible, easily circumvented by adjustments in book(cid:173)keeping. The same Agriculture Department official remarked, \"These debts will not come due for another 10 years. Right now in Viet(cid:173)nam and Cambodia they are worried about how they are going to get through next week. They do not have time to worry about 1984.'' PUBLIC LA'W 480 LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1975 The official projections for fiscal year 1975 country by country Food For Peace levels will be made public when A.I.D. sends to Congress its annual Congressional Presenta(cid:173)tion books. In November 1973 the U.S. Embassy in Saigon sent to Washington its request for PL 480 Title I commodities totalling $283.4 million. The Embassy requested 350,000 metric tons in fiscal year 1974 and 420,000 metric tons of wheat, up from 150,000 metric tons in fiscal year 1974. An advance look at A.I.D. Congressional Presentation book for fiscal year 1975 reveals that the Administration's projection for Title I commodities is $160 million, and for Title II a mere $553,000. Since the Embassy's re(cid:173)quest was for more commodities in fiscal year 1975 than in the previous year, the lower A.I.D. projections raise some new questions. Is Congress being misled by an unrealistically low projection for fiscal year 1975 that as the year progresses will climb dramatically, or has the program been given a lower priority now that counter-part cur(cid:173)rencies can no longer be channeled directly into South Vietnam's and Cambodia's de(cid:173)fense budgets? 7 The July 1 deadline applies to the date on which agreements for commodities are signed and funds obligated, not to the date the funds are actually expended. Therefore currencies may continue to be generated from PL 480 expenditures many months after the deadline. The fl.seal year 1975 projections for cam(cid:173)bodia as revealed by the Congressional Pres(cid:173)entation book are $77 million for Title I sales and only $11,000 for Title II grants for refugees. CONCLUSION The Food for Peace program must be dras(cid:173)tically restructured in South Vietnam and Cambodia to prevent its continued use by the Administration for \"security considera(cid:173)tions\" in both countries. The Ti tie I sales program should be sharply reduced, if not suspended, in con(cid:173)junction with a general suspension of non(cid:173)humanitarian U.S. aid to any party in South Vietnam who fails to act in accordance with the provisions of the Paris Agreement. Until peace is restored in South Vietnam and Cam(cid:173)bodia the United States will find itself being relied upon to ship huge amounts of grains and other commodities to Indochina while shortages and rising prices prevail at home. The Food for Peace program has no coun(cid:173)try-by-country ceilings. There is nothing to prevent the Administration from diverting huge amounts of PL 480 commodities from other parts of the world to Indochina this next year, as they did in fiscal year 1974. It is imperative that Congress impose a ceiling on the total amount of Food for Peace commodities that may be obligated for South Vietnam and Cambodia during the next fis(cid:173)cal year. The refugees, the unemployed and the un(cid:173)der-employed who most need the PL 480 foodstuffs do not have the money with which to buy them. The free-market system in South Vietnam today is not functioning efficiently and is not distributing PL 480 commodities to those in need. In South Vietnam today there is actually an excess of rice in the Thieu government's warehouses and open talk of exporting as much as 50,-000 metric tons. A rather sizeable pipeline of undelivered commodities exists. This results in part from the Administration's rush to get the maximum number of agreements signed before the July 1 prohibition on com(cid:173)mon defense use of PL 480-generated cur(cid:173)rencies became effective. When all parties in Indochina begin to act in accordance with the provisions of the Paris Agreement, Congress should re-examine the Title I program in South Vietnam and Cambodia in an attempt to determine if the Title I program is the best way to dis(cid:173)tribute PL 480 commodities to those in need. The advent of peace and the subsequent return of the refugees to their homes and farm lands should within a. year put both South Vietnam and Cambodia on the road to self-sufficiency in terms of foodstuffs and thus will free limited PL 480 commodities for use in other areas of the world where the demand is caused by a calamity of nature, rather than by a political conflict. To meet the immediate needs of South Vietnam's and Cambodia's people the Title II grant program should be increased and some mechanism developed utilizing volun(cid:173)tary agencies and multilateral organizations, that will distribute the commodities to those most in need, especially refugees. But this program need by of only short duration, for soon after they leave the refugee and \"re(cid:173)settlement\" camps and return to their homes the refugees will again become productive members of the society and will start pro(cid:173)viding their own food. The world is experiencing a severe food shortage in the less-developed countries. World surplus grain stocks are at a 20-year low, and a. series of droughts in the Sub(cid:173)Saha.ra. region of Africa could ca.use the deaths of millions of people a.s a result of starvation and of diseases rendered fatal by malnutrition. In the face of such desperate needs the United States can no longer justify divert(cid:173)ing 45 percent of total PL 480 commodities to South Vietnam and Cambodia under a ",

It including also operates several book clubs Seven Arts and Book Find Clubs. The circulation of all of its magazines has been increasing steadily. It also owns the Pioneer Press Incorporated which pub(cid:173)lishes 18 weekly newspapers in 28 c;ommun(cid:173)ities surrounding Chicago. Its 1972 net income was $22,407 ,000, which was less than its 1971 earnings of $23,265,-000. However, that was the year it ceased publishing Life magazine and divested itself of the Francesville project. It is most revealing to note that the day after the announcement of the demise of Life, Time, Inc. stock went up 6 points. In 1973, Time, Incorporated, had a 12.5 per cent return on equity; and 11.4 per cent return on total capital; and a 46.1 per cent increase in earnings per share in 1973 over the 1970-1972 period. Various reasons have been given for the demise of Life. However, postal costs, as shown by the following quotes, was not the reason. \"Most media watchers attribute the pio(cid:173)neer photo-journal's decline and fall to the inability of a mass or consumer magazine to compete with TV and special interest period(cid:173)icals as an advertising medium, and its in(cid:173)ability to cater to the editorial preference of the audiences of the 1970's.\" The Value The April 19, 1974 Washington Star-News reported that Mr. James R. Shepley, presi(cid:173)dent of Time, Incorporated, reported at its April 1974 stockholders meeting that higher publishing profits in the first quarter of 1974 reflected \"excellent\" results by Time-Life Books. The Star-News reported that Time, Inc. earnings during the first quarter rose to a record $10.37 million or $1.01 a share, up 23 per cent fro1-. $8.53 million or 82 cents a share in the same period a year ago. The publishing company said that rev(cid:173)enues grew 17 per cent to also hit a peak of $178.27 million, compared with $162.94 mil(cid:173)lion in 1973. The fitar quoted Shepley as saying an an(cid:173)ticipated decline in magazine advertising(cid:173)did not materialize.-In fact total domestic advertising revenues of our magazines ex(cid:173)ceeded the comparable period last year. Line Investment Survey, 12/29/72. \"The evidence had been mounting during the last few of Life's 36 years of existence that the magazine had either outlived or outgrown its position as a useful advertising medium.\" Ibid. \"It is ironic, then, that Time, Inc., stock rose $6.50 per share on the day of the an(cid:173)nouncement of Life's folding. Financial ex(cid:173)perts noted that this was because investors felt that Time, Inc. management had made a hardheaded decision which would benefit the entire company in the long run.\" Michael S. Lasky, Associate Editor, Folio: The Maga(cid:173)January for Magazine Management, zine 1973. \"Mr. Heiskell (chairman and chief execu(cid:173)tive, Time, Inc.) said: 'The closing of Life and the sale of our interest in St. Frances(cid:173)ville significantly strengthen Time, Inc.'s profitability. In 1973 we look forward to a strong corporate performance, due particu(cid:173)larly to an expected continued improvement by our magazine group,\" as reported in The Wall Street Journal of January 19, 1973. Obviously, postal rate cost was not the reason Life magazine closed publication. Shepley was also quoted as saying: \"Magazine circulation also remained healthy-with circulation revenues reported at an all-time high and subscription renew(cid:173)als-particularly strong.\" NORTON-SIMON CORPORATION The Norton-Simon Corporation, which owns McCall Corporation, publisher of McCalls and Redbook has twenty subsidiaries including the Canada Dry Corporation, Hunt Foods and Industries and the Max Factor, Company.

But your point-Dean tells it as if Ehrlichman ordered him to get him out of the country. Right? Is that what you have? HP. That's right-and that's the way it comes through Liddy. Hunt tells us that's the way Liddy stated it-my principal. P. My principals? H.P. My principal said. P. Tell you what? HP. Get out of the country Hunt. It doesn't seem to me that if that fact reaches light of day that it can be anything else but (inaudible) impact on the White House. P. (Inaudible) message. HP. (Inaudible) nothing to do with Jus(cid:173)tice or injustice. P. I know that it's because of the Presi(cid:173)dency which, of course, HP. Yes sir. P. Is what we are thinking about. I ap(cid:173)preciate what you say, because, I'm thinking about that too. I'm trying to be fair. HP. Well let me put it another way. If I were Ehrlichman I would feel like I had to ,go under the circumstances. P. You would? Even Ehrlichma.n? Halde(cid:173)man too? HP. Both of them. P. How do you feel a.bout Haldeman audible)? HP. Well (inaudible). P. You feel even more strongly? HP. Yes, sir, assuming, now remember what we have, P. Yeah. HP. Dean Haldeman. P. And? HP. Haldeman didn't say stop. P. I see. HP. [ can tell you-if one of my prose(cid:173)cutors ca.me in and said another prosecutor was out bugging somebody in organized crime, I would not say we ought not to be involved in it-P. Dean told me. HP. I'd go to him and say stop it. P. Excuse me. Did Dean say he discussed the bugging with Haldeman? HP. He discussed the substance of the budget proposals which included the bugging operation. Operation. P. Haldeman or Strachan? HP. With Haldeman. And said we ought not to be involved in this and Haldeman agrees but nothing happens. Neither one of them stopped it. Now, maybe they both they were outranked by John Mitchell. I don't know. P. Dean now says that he discussed the bugging operation-that's what I want to know. I didn't understand he said that. I thought he said he did that with Strachan. HP. Magruder-Magruder says. this with discussed says he thought P. I get it. HP. (Inaudible) goes through Strachan. Dean says when he ca.me back from the sec(cid:173)ond meeting he told Haldeman, \"This is ter(cid:173)rible, we ought not to be involved in this.\" P. Right-right. HP. And nobody does anything about it. P. He hasn't been too damn forthright has he? H.P. Well. P. I mean, he should have told me about Haldeman. H.P. It's awful hard to debrief a man, Mr. President, in an hour or two as you know. P. Yeah-when I asked him specifically did Haldeman know and so forth-and he said no. And I guess maybe he was being perfectly honest. Told me that just this morning. And I said, he had no knoWledge before, and neither did Ehrlichman, and he said neither did he. But I guess what he meant was that-you could reconclle that only by saying-that he haid told Haldeman (in-of about it and Haldeman d.id't know that it went forward. Maybe that's what he (inaud(cid:173)ible). H.P. That's-P. That would not make Haldeman liable in this case-the very fact he didn't stop it. He didn't have the responsibility. I am looking at it just from a legal standpoint. Now un(cid:173)derstand, from a public standpoint it's dev(cid:173)astating. You think he would be liable for not issuing an order to (inaudible). I sup(cid:173)pose if Dean was his subordinate. (Inaud(cid:173)ible.) H.P. (Inaudible) a subordinate. It depends on who has authority to act with respect to the budget proposals? P. Haldeman (inaudible). H.P. He did not have any authority? P. No sir-none, none-all Mitchell-cam(cid:173)paign funds. He had no authority whatever. I wouldn't tell him (inaudible). H.P. Then you're left with the fact that he has knowledge of. P. That's right. H.P. But he doesn't a.ct upon. P. Knowledge of a proposal? H.P. That comes out as a misprision of a felony. P. Huh? H.P. That comes out to a misprision of a felony. Misprision is a statute that is hardly ever enforced. You could put everybody in Jail I suppose 1f you tried to. P. Knowledge and so on? H.P. That's right. P. Knowledge it's being considered. H.P. That's right. (Inaudible) type thing-P. (Inaudible) say specifically that he dis(cid:173)cussed the budget proposal with Haldeman! Well I'll oe damned! H.P. I think I have in those notes there that Dean came back to the White House after the meeting, told Haldeman about the proposals that were being discussed in the office of the Attorney General, and said we ought not to be involved. And Haldeman agrees, but nobody stopped the operation. P. Dean says-H.P. (Inaudible) told him thing I'm saying (inaudible). P. \u00b7should we do it-should we do it from the top? Well, I'm going to talk to Blll Rogers a little later-I'll get his Judgment about-on this-(inaudible) Haldeman.

That's what I'm con(cid:173)cerned about. I think they both-look 1f they're going to go they both got to go, don't they? They ought to go ~ether? H.P. I think so, yes sir. Mainly because I don't know how that looks to you, but from the outside, they a.re almost a team. P. That's right. H.P. But to let one go and the allegations with the other being (inaudible). The next day it might develop that (inaudible). P. Well (inaudible) my Judgment on this after I talk to Rogers. It's a very close call.

Oh, I'll move on it. I'm Just trying to think about whether-before Magruder strikes. H.P. I'm bothered, you know because this may be a terrible injustice to both of those men. P. I know that (inaudible) but my point is (inaudible) how it is (inaudible) whether they go before Magruder. Let me tell you(cid:173)let me put it this way-I really am in a pret(cid:173)ty poor position to have them go before Dean goes. H.P. Well that's correct-I agree with that. the only so P. I can't announce Dean going toda.y(cid:173)that would jeopardize your prosecution. Or can I announce it? I am very seriously think(cid:173)ing. H.P. You're your own agent on that.

I don't want-want to be in a posi(cid:173)tion to say to John Dean-John, I did not recommend that the President take your resignation. P. Fine. All right. H.P. As long as I could say that Dean's been here, he's talked to you. It's between the two of you. You're timing on that is okay with me. P. I see. Even announce Dean today? H.P. Yes sir. P. That wouldn't Jeopardize your prosecu(cid:173)tion? H.P. Well, we stm have to bargain with him. But I don't-I don't see that-he's try(cid:173)ing to use that, but I don't see that. As long as I can say, the prosecution team can say, we did not recommend that. P. How is he trying to use it? You mean(cid:173)you say that-I'm a little concerned about Dean's or his lawyers-that he's going to attack the President and so forth. Other than that, I mean Dean above all else-H.P. Well I don't think the President per(cid:173)sonally-the Presidency as an office as the Administration. P. Because of? H.P. Because of Ehrlichman and Haldeman. P. It's Ehrlichman and Haldeman he's really talking a.bout? H.P. That may be his guts poker in the course of negotiations. That's what they say. P.

            "404": "14266 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u00b7-SENATE \u00b71.Way 13, 197 4 Presidency,\" Mr. Wicker concludes, \"the first order of business ought to be the Budget Reform Act. In the fight against inflation, as well as in tne effort to re(cid:173)store balanced government in America, no single reform is more important.\" Mr. President, I cannot agree more. ask unanimous consent to have printed in the R53*84 Mr. Wicker's arti(cid:173)cle entitled \"Restraining the Giant.\" There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: I RESTRAINING THE GIANT ( By Tom Wicker) Watergate, Senator Jacob Javits of New York said the other day, was \"a symptom of political decadence\" predictable by Lord Ac(cid:173)ton's dictum that \"power tends to corrupt rand absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" The power of the American Presidency ls not absolute but it is great, and too nearly un(cid:173)checked, and it has greatly corrupted the of(cid:173)fice. As Mr. Javits put it, \"The death and maiming of tens of thousands of our young in Vietnam, the Watergate scandals and the shadow of impeachment a.re expressions of an almost grotesque imbalance of power.\" (He might have added \"the deaths of hundreds of thosuands of their young and old.\") What is to he also about that \"grotesque imbalance of power\" now residing in the Presidency? The departure of Richard Nixon from that office, however it occurs, wm not restore the balance; nor can any election guarantee that the victor will not succumb to the temptations of power in ways more dangerous than any yet seen. In this context, even impeachment punishes transgression, and that is better than letting it go unpunished. But the prob(cid:173)lem is how to prevent the transgression(cid:173)how to provide a system of checks and bal(cid:173)ances against abuse of the inevitable power of the chief executive of one of the world's most powerful nations. Mr. Javits was instrumental in develop(cid:173)ment of an essential first step already taken-passage over Mr. Nixon's veto of the War Powers Act, limiting Presidential abil\u00b7 ity to commit troops abroad by executive action. Now Mr. Javlts has proposed a pack(cid:173)age of further reforms, the most notable of which is as follows: Congress would require the President to report to it annually what steps he had ta.ken to carry our Congressional laws and resolu(cid:173)tions passed in the last session; he and his Cabinet heads then would submit to ques(cid:173)tioning by a new Joint Select Committee of both houses; and Congresss later would vote itself satisfied or not with Presidential ac(cid:173)tions. If not satisfied, it would direct what further steps it wished taken. Such a procedure would give Congress-as Mr. Nixon's staff types might say-greater \"stroke\" on executive policy and administra(cid:173)tive oversight, and-perhaps more impor(cid:173)tant-a means of directly and personally challenging a President and his Cabinet. That question-and-answer session surely ought to be carried on the television net(cid:173)works. Sena.tor Lloyd Bentsen of Texas has made an interesting proposal that might largely remove politics from the Department of Jus(cid:173)tice, without removing that department from the reach of Presidential policy. He would bar the appointment of anyone who had held a. pa.id or unpaid position in any Pres(cid:173)idential candidate's campaign, or in any na(cid:173)tional or state party organization, to the offices of Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Assistant Attorney General or Solici(cid:173)tor General. The Attorney General, not the President, then would appoint U.S. Attorneys and U.S. Marshals. The Hatch Act, prohibit(cid:173)ing partisan polltical activity, would be ex(cid:173)tended to everyone in the Department of Justice, from the Attorney General on down. Sena.tor Ja.vits echoed a proposal of Sen(cid:173)a.tor Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin to ban any form of wiretapping or bugging without a court order; and Senator Henry Jackson has put in a blll to require complete accounting to Congress by any agency engaging in any kind of political surveillance. Such surveil(cid:173)lance would have to be specifically justlfled by the agency involved. Tighter Congressional oversight of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. and a thorough review and, if necessary, reorgani(cid:173)zation of those agencies ought to be under(cid:173)taken. The posslb1Uty of a. seven-or nlne(cid:173)year fixed term for the F.B.I. director, to re(cid:173)move him from direct Presidential political control, should also be studied by Congress. Such steps might well make secret police tactics all but impossible. The legislators should not a.gain permit a. President to create, as Mr. Nixon did, super(cid:173)Cabinet officials not subject to Senate con(cid:173)firmation, and thus not subject to Congres(cid:173)sional questioning. The Gray and Richard(cid:173)son hearings, in 1973, are examples of the :value of the confirmation process; while John Ehrlichma.n as chairman of the Do(cid:173)mestic Council, to whom several Cabinet officers were made subordinate, exemplifies the kind of powerful official a President now can create entirely on his own authority. But if Congress really wants to regain anything like equal status with the Presi(cid:173)dency, the first order of business ought to be the Budget Reform Act. Passed in differing versions by both houses, and a.waiting recon(cid:173)cillation in Senate-House conference, this mt'lasure would at last provide the admin(cid:173)istrative machinery necessary for Congress to play an effective pa.rt in putting together a. coherent Federal budget-the very engine of the Government. The essential idea of both budget reform bills is that Congress would establish its own annual budgetary cellings, with more-or-less self-enforcing provisions for keeping its ap(cid:173)propriations within them, or providing the additional revenues to cover excess spending. In the fight against inflation, a.s well as in the effort to restore balanced government in America, no single reform is more impor(cid:173)tant. EDUCATION ASSISTANCE PRO(cid:173)GRAMS FOR VETERANS Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, edu(cid:173)cation assistance programs for veterans have been among the most successful and productive ever enacted by our Gov(cid:173)ernment. After World War II and the Korean conflict educational benefits re(cid:173)ceived by returning Gis were a major force behind the economic recovery o! the fifties and dividends from this post(cid:173)war investment continue to be reflected in today's society Today, Vietnam era veterans face an extremely difficult problem of readjust(cid:173)ment and education benefits often de(cid:173)termine the difference between success and failure for them. The Veteran's Af(cid:173)fairs Committee is currently working on a comprehensive bill to update veterans education benefits to put them on par with benefits which were available to World War II vets. As a cosp0nsor of s. 2784, I know that time is needed to allow proper consideration of such a comprehensive bill. But thousands of vet(cid:173)erans who might benefit from this bill do not have time-because on May 31, 1974, their eligibility for benefits will expire. To prevent this from occurring, I urge the Senate to vote for S. 3398 and extend eligibility for education bene(cid:173)fits from 8 to 10 years. PRAISE FOR DR. RIDDICK Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to add my appreciation to the many ex(cid:173)pressions of deserved praise to Dr. Rid(cid:173)dick, the Senate Parliamentarian, for the new edition of \"Senate Procedure\" that he developed. His is an honorable tradition stem(cid:173)ming from the efforts of Thomas Jeffer(cid:173)son. Jefferson, as Vice President, devel(cid:173)oped a set of rules of procedure, still known as \"Jefferson's Manual.\" In pref ace to his seminal work, Mr. Jefferson wrote: I have begun a sketch which those who come after me wlll success! vely correct and fill-up till a. code of rules shall be formed for the use of the Senate, the effects of which may be accuracy in business, econ(cid:173)omy of time, order, uniformity and impar(cid:173)tiality. Mr. Dr. Riddick's work is consistent with Jefferson's guidelines. As a new(cid:173)comer to the Senate, I feel an extra di(cid:173)mension of appreciation for the new edition. Thank you, Dr. Riddick.

Many veterans who are already in school have disc-0vered that an 8-year period following discharge is simply not enough time to complete their advanced education under the GI bill. This legisla(cid:173)tion would extend the period of eligibility from 8 to 10 years. For about 285,000 veterans, this is necessary to prevent a cutoff in benefits on May 31. I had hoped we would include this pro(cid:173)vision in a comprehensive educational benefits bill similar to that which was en(cid:173)acted in the House. But sincere differ(cid:173)ences in judgment over the magnitude of the proposed increases in monthly bene(cid:173)fits appear to make this impossible. I personally favor at least the 24-percent increase in allowances mandated in the bill I cosponsored, S. 2784:. The House has already approved increases of about 13.6 percent while the administration has ex(cid:173)pressed its support for increases no greater than 8 percent. In any event, quick action on the legis(cid:173)lation to extend the period of eligibility is necessary if we are to avoid a situa(cid:173)tion in which thousands of veterans find their education benefits interrupted. It is the least a grateful Nation should do to express thanks to our servicemen. JUSTICE FOR VETERANS Mr. McGOVERR Mr. President, I am pleased with the way the Senate has re(cid:173)sponded to the urgent need to extend the eligibility period for Vietnam veter(cid:173)ans participating in the GI bill educa(cid:173)tion and training program. Realizing that over a quarter of a million young veterans could be adversely affected by a cutoff in their benefits if prompt ac(cid:173)tion were not taken, the Senate has separated out the 2-year extension provi(cid:173)sion from the other amendments to the G: bill being considered and cut through the redtape in order to enact the exten(cid:173)sion ahead of the May 31 deadline. The effort to revitalize the GI bill to the point where young veterans are able to use its benefits in all states and from all 1ncome and social strata has become a long affair. Perhaps the Senate is open to some criticism for not moving faster on the entire package of GI bill benefits. However, it is obvious to those of us who have been working toward a satisfactory benefit level for Vietnam veterans that the major roadblock has been the un(cid:173)stinting opposition of the administration and some Members of the Congress who have chosen to ignore the real plight of the veteran in favor of carrying the ball for the Budget Bureau and the Veterans' Administration. It would be a travesty, Mr. President, if the Congress were to back away from the kind of solid, comprehensive reform we need in the GI bill now that the prob(cid:173)lem has been exposed thoroughly and support for the reform is coming in from all quarters. The House of Representatives has passed their own version of a GI reform bill including the 2-year extension pro(cid:173)vision. Because they are already com-mitted to the provision, it would seem a simple matter to expect them to pass S. 3398 routinely and allow the Senate the simple courtesy of completing our work on the remainder of the amend(cid:173)ments before going to conference on the final shape of a comprehensive bill. How(cid:173)ever, the sounds from the other chamber do not indicate that this course will be followed. Mr. President, if the House attempts to amend S. 3398 with the provisions of their own previously passed bill, H.R. 12628, it could mean the end of all hope for literally thousands of young veterans who have already been subjected to out(cid:173)right neglect and unwarranted abuse. It would make it unlikely that we could then reach the real substance of the is(cid:173)sue we are dealing with. If that happens, it will be difficult for any Member of Congress to go out and face young vet(cid:173)erans. It will be obvious to them that the Congress has not responded to their le(cid:173)gitimate and long-neglected needs but has chosen instead to play parliamen(cid:173)tary games. Let me back up for a moment and say that the House should be commended for its quicker response to the problem. They had their.bill passed over 2 months ago. But that was before we learned of the reversal in unemployment rates for Vietnam veterans. It was before a mul(cid:173)titude of problems in administering GI bill programs were exposed. And it was prior to the announcement by the Col(cid:173)lege Entrance Examination Board that the cost of a college education will rise an average of 9.4 percent next fall. Fi(cid:173)nally, it preceded the first quarter eco(cid:173)nomic statistics that show the rate of inflation hit 10.8 percent in the first 3 months of 1974. Taken in the light of these recent events, the House proposal to increase subsistence benefits by 13.6 percent is barely enough to keep up with the rise in costs since the House voted. Under the able guidance of Chairman HARTKE, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee is considering all these problems and should be able to wrap up a good solid bill that responds to all the needs within 4 to 6 weeks. I want to take just a moment to discuss the cost factor of the GI bill since this seems to be a major sticking point for those who are rightfully concerned about the size of the Federal budget. I am sure that many in the Congress feel that the provisions of H.R. 12628, although ad(cid:173)mittedly inadequate to solve the prob(cid:173)lems of the Vietnam veteran, are already approaching the borderline on what we can afford to spend for the program. Any expansion on the provisions of the House bill by the Senate would be viewed as yet another effort to bust the budget. There are two very solid arguments against this thinking. First, there is the obvious need of the veteran for expanded benefits and the real value of the pro(cid:173)gram both to the veteran and to society. The Educational Testing Service in its congressional authorized report stated that--There is no doubt that the World War II GI bill was one of the most important and effective pieces of social legislation Congress had ever enacted. It profoundly affected the fortunes of veterans and postwar society, and it transformed the Nation's higher edu(cid:173)cation system. Mr. President, the value of the much more generous World War II GI bill in hard statistical terms has been quoted on this floor time and again. That program turned out hundreds of thousands of doctors, lawyers, and specialized profes(cid:173)sionals who\u00b7 have returned the invest(cid:173)ment made in them many times over in their contributions to society in general and through their increased earning power in particular. The second argument is as simple as the size of the overbloated military buctg .. et for the coming fiscal year. Secretary of Defense Schlesinger admitted in front of two separate congressional commit(cid:173)tees that the military budget requests were padded to the tune of between $2 and $5 billion in an effort to stave off the threat of increased unemployment and a possible recession. Not only is that bad military strategy, Mr. President, that is bad economics. We have an inflation problem, and military spending is among the most inflationary kinds of spending there is. It must be obvious to anyone with an elementary understanding of economics and an appreciation for what the World War II GI program accomplished that the money would be much better invested in the education and training of our young veterans. Rather than pouring our dollars into wasteful arms projects, we should be arming the Vietnam veteran with a diploma or vocational training. That is the kind of investment in Amer(cid:173)ica that we can see grow and produce results that will match our internal eco(cid:173)nomic strength against our military might. Mr. President, it is almost exactly 1 year to the day since I introduced the first set of GI bill amendments in the 93d Congress. Since that time, I have watched the Congress and the country become aware of the problems encoun(cid:173)tered by our self-proclaimed \"prisoners of peace.\" The Vietnam veterans GI bill which I introduced with Senators MATHIAS, INOUYE, and DOLE last Decem(cid:173)ber has acquired 35 additional cospon(cid:173)sors. The Senate Veterans' Affairs Com(cid:173)mittee led by Senator HARTKE has come forth with their own very worthy bill. We have all worked hard and we are now close to passing landmark legislation that could finally bring justice to millions of young veterans who have known nothing but neglect and injustice since their time of service. It would be unfair and highly irregu(cid:173)lar for the House to expect the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee to meet in conference over an omnibus GI bill when the full Senate has only acted on the 2-year extension. It would be unfair to over a quarter of a million young veterans to tie up the simple 2-year extension provided by S. 3398 in a mangle of par(cid:173)liamentary bickering and political log(cid:173)rolling. And it would be an insult to all young veterans to turn the entire pro(cid:173)ceedings into a battle of \"who is to blame for the holdup in benefit increases.\" It is my hope that the House will pass S. 3398 ",

PITTSBURGH HIGH SCHOOL STU(cid:173)DENTS SUPPORT WILDERNESS BILL HON. WILLIAM S. MOORHEAD OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, May 13, 1974 Mr. MOORHEAD of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, two Pittsburgh area women, Lisa Voss and Susan Frasure, both stu(cid:173)dents at North Allegheny High School, have prepared thoughtful cogent state(cid:173)ments in support of the eastern wilder(cid:173)ness legislation that was considered by the Interior Committee's Subcommittee on Public Lands, chaired by our very able colleague from Montana, JOHN MELCHER. Although they were not able to present their testimony in person to the sub(cid:173)committee, the remarks of Misses Voss and Frasure will be made part of the subcommittee's official record. As the subcommittee chairman said in a note to me, the statements are \"a fine example of rational intelligent youth in(cid:173)volvement in public affairs.\" I could not agree with him more. I would like to include these statements in the RECORD at this time: STATEMENT BY LISA Voss My name ls Lisa Voss. I am eighteen years old and a senior at North Allegheny High School in Pittsburgh. I am speaking for the student committee of the North Area Envi(cid:173)ronmental Council. The N.A.E.C. is a group of adults in our community whose main con(cid:173)cern 1s the preservation of the environment. The student committee of the N.A.E.C. work along with the adults in various community projects-. We are involved in a recycling op(cid:173)eration in the community and various other environmental projects. Presently, we are planning future backpacking weekends for the months of May, June, and July. My group has sent me here for the pur(cid:173)pose of testifying on their behalf concerning the Eastern Wildnerness Act. We are totally in favor of the passing of this act and es(cid:173)pecially concerned with Dolly Sods and Otter Creek of West Virginia being defined as an instant wilderness. Along these lines, we would also like to see Hickory Creek, Tracey Ridge, and Allegheny Front classlfted as wil(cid:173)derness study areas. Speaking for myself and the other members of my committee, I urge you to vote in favor of this bill. I have backpacked in the Dolly Sods area twice, and in Otter Creek and Hickory Creek, once. I have never felt more freedom or tranquillty as I have when hiking and camp(cid:173)ing in these areas. It pains me to think of the consequences that these areas could suffer without the help of these bllls. The simple Joy of drinking clean, clear water from a mountain stream excels all others for me. To be able to breathe that wonderful, fresh EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS country air is an experience that I hope others will be able to enjoy as a result of the passing of the Eastern Wilderness Act. The quiet sounds and the beauty of nature it(cid:173)self stay with me as I reflect back on my past experiences with the wilderness. I intend to expand my love and knowledge of the wilder(cid:173)ness in future years, and hope that this will be made possible through the passing of this and other similar acts. My greatest hope is that when I'm older and have a family of my own, the love I hold for the beautiful crea(cid:173)tions of God can be passed on to my children. Man can try to create beauty, but to me, the only real beauty stems from that which is natural and pure. A virgin wilderness 1s the most natural and pure of anything I know on this earth. I sincerely hope there will still be virgin wilderness for future generations to enjoy. In our organization, one of the points we stress the most before embarking on a back(cid:173)packing trip., is that we are merely guests to the wilderness. By this we mean that it should be left as we found it so that the next people that come through can enjoy it to the fullest extent, without a trace of any pre(cid:173)vious presence of many. For example, visual(cid:173)ize the Joy and delight I felt upon a return visit to the Dolly Sods area when I observed a particular spot I remembered, and it looked as if it had never been touched by man. I be(cid:173)lieve that respect for the wilderness is the most important requirement for a person to be considered a good camper. In closing, I would like to thank you so very much for letting me have the opportu(cid:173)nity to testify here today. I'm sure it will be an experience I shall never forget. I ask you once more to consider what I've said, and realize how much the preservation of the Wilderness means to me, and so many others like me who share my deep love for nature. STATEMENT BY SUSAN FRASURE My name 1s Susan Frasure. I am an 18 year old senior at North Allegheny High School in Pittsburgh, Pa., and am on the executive board of the school's Environmental Action Club. Our club has been very active towards our environment by participating in recycling activities, setting up a hiking trail for the community, and going on backpacking studies. I am representing my club today because of our acute interest in the wilderness. Every member of our group is very much for the passing of the Eastern Wilderness Act. We have a special interest in the Dolly Sods and Otter Creek Wildernesses in West Virginia as we have backpacked there before and plan to return again this summer. Particularly, we are quite anxious to see Hickory Creek, Tracy Ridge, and the Al(cid:173)legheny Front of Pennsylvania included as Wilderness Study Areas. This fall our club packed at Hickory Creek and immediately fell in love with it. We hold great hopes that it will become a study area and eventually be classified as a true wilderness. We hope to visit either Tracy Ridge or the Allegheny Front this spring. It will be a great let down to our club if any of these natural wilder(cid:173)nesses are allowed to fall apart because they are not classified as study areas. North Allegheny urges you to vote for the passing of the Eastern Wilderness Act and including the Allegheny areas as Wilderness Study Areas. There are so many benefits that could come from the passing of these bills. As an experienced backpacker, I know the reasons for valuing the wilderness. First of all, there is no better way to obtain adven(cid:173)turous exploring and exciting travel as in a wilderness. The thrills of self discovery and challenge are precious feelings I have found only through hiking. For those of us who are of a religious nature, there can be no better way to enjoy communion with God's beauty May 13, 1974 I and feel his presence as in the solitude of the wllderness. The areas in the Eastern Wllder(cid:173)ness Act are perfect places to find refuge in forgetting one's problems by returning to nature. Wilderness areas have potential use for scientific research, including ecological and geological features. Also, the wilderness is a wonderful place for outdo<;>r education. have experienced all the wonders of the wilderness. I'm asking you to make sure that future generations can share my discoveries by passing these bills. Hickory Creek, Tracy Ridge and the Alle(cid:173)gheny Front have all the qualifications for a wilderness study area. All through these areas the affects of nature are apparent. There are no signs of human habitation nor man's impact on nature such as roads or buildings. These are places where nature's balance of life can continue as it was in(cid:173)tended without the help of man. I wish there was a way that I could convey to you my love of the wllderness so that you could then see the necessity for preserving it. There ls no other place that could possi(cid:173)bly hold as much natural beauty and tran(cid:173)quillty. Backpacking has brought to me wonderful opportunities to express myself and become closer to my friends. In the wilderness it becomes easy to understand one's purpose and to see how little man truly is. It would be sinful for man to de(cid:173)stroy these areas and to therefore lose the essence of his natural habitat. Once again I must ask you for my peers and especially for myself that you support all wilderness bills. Thank you so much for this opportunity of talking to such a distin(cid:173)guished group. Hopefully, what I have said today has made some impact. I also wish that someday all of you can discover for yourself the solitude and tranqullity that exists in the wilderness. DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS FREEZES COMMITTEE PROPOSAL DEEP(cid:173)REFORM HON. JOHN B. ANDERSON OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, May 13, 1974 Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. Mr. Speak(cid:173)er, I was distressed and disheartened to learn that the House Democratic Caucus last week voted to move the Bolling(cid:173)Martin committee reform proposal from the back burner to the deep freeze. If the Democrats had any real interest in seeing this important reform through in this Congress they would have moved the res(cid:173)olution to the front burner of the House Rules Committee now so that it could be reported to the full House in time for ac(cid:173)tion yet this year. Instead, they have spe(cid:173)cifically ordered the Democratic mem(cid:173)bers of the Rules Committee to take no action on the resolution while it is re(cid:173)posing in the reform graveyard of a caucus task force, reportedly stacked with opponents to the reform. Mr. Speaker, the Democratic Caucus cannot deceive the American people with this fancy bit of footwork, because no matter how you look at it, they are doing the \"antireform shuffle\"; that is, two foot-dragging sidesteps, followed by four steps backward. I think it is interesting to note that the July reporting deadline for the task force conveniently runs up against the August recess, followed by the fall election campaign, followed by a ",

That's done, except-except for all the in(cid:173)formation I want. You know what I mean. E. Wilson said to us, \"Beware of Petersen. He talks.\" He said, he cited a case that he had that Petersen was involved in-H. And he said that one problem in dealing with him was that every point he makes is accompanied by a story, and that latter is so. P. He probably foxed him. Well, then may(cid:173)be all I'll do w1 th Petersen-he said that he'd give me 12 hours notice With regard to the Magruder thing and I think I want that. H. Yeah. P. Bill doesn't know how procedure works---E. Let me tell you what that procedure is. Wilson explained that to us too. He said that where a man goes in on an information and pleads guilty in this District, it is customary for the judge to interrogate if he Wishes to. And also for there to be filed a statement of the case-ah-in the nature of information. Now the information which they wm file instead of indictment names the co-con(cid:173)spirators in the conspiracy charge who are not indicted. E. That does not mean that you won't be indicted later. It means for the purpose of that information which is then filed, you are not indicted. And so this is a list of people who in a description of a conspiracy pattern are co-conspirators. His analysis of the pros and cons of this are that for the prosecutor to come forward and say, \"If you will sus(cid:173)pend these birds, I will name them in the list of co-conspirators,\" gets the prosecutor off a. difficult political hook because when the judge asks, \"Were there any other co-con(cid:173)spirators and so on?\" He says, \"Well, they have already been suspended-ah, and may be indicted.\" We reserve the right to indict them but we are going to have them before the Grand Jury. R. So, are they going to help a bit? E. Well, it doesn't help us. It helps the prosecutor with his problem. On the other hand, he says, there is a certain negative in it. From a political standpoint for the Ad\u00b7 ministration in that the question will arise, \"Well, why weren't their names on there if they're co-conspirators?\" P. Right. E. Somebody's covered up. R. Yes. H. That's worse than putting them on the list. E. Yeah, and so, he said-R. I don't know, John. And let me go back for just a moment on this procedure. The in(cid:173)formation is filed by the prosecutor himself, without a Grand Jury action? H. Yeah. ",

(2) Section 613(b) (7) of such Code 1s amended by (A) dele\u00b7ting \"or\" at the end of subparagraph (A) thereof; (B) by deleting the period at the end of subparagraph (B) thereof and by inserting in lieu thereof \"; or\"; and (C) by inserting the following new subparagraph after such subparagraph (B): \" ( C) oil and ~ wells.\" (b) CERTAIN GAS WELLS. Section 613 of the Internal Revenue of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 613) is amend,ed by adding art; the end thereof the following new subsection: \"(e) SPECIAL RULE FOR CERTAIN GAS WELLS. \" ( 1) The gas wells referred to in section 613(b) (1) (A) are-(A) wells producing regulated natural gas, to the extent of such production, and (B) wells producing natural gas sold under a fixed contract to the extent of such produc(cid:173)tion. \"(2) (A) The term 'na.tural gas sold under a fixed contra.ct' means domestic natural gas sold by the producer under a contract, in ef(cid:173)fect on April 10, 1974, and all times there(cid:173)after before such sale, under which the price for such g,as cannot be adjusted to reflect to any extent the increase in Uabilities of the seller for tax under this section by reason of the repeal of per:centage deplertion. Price increases subsequent to April 10, 1974 shall be presumed to take increases in tax liabm(cid:173)ties into account unless the taxpayer dem(cid:173)onstrates the contrary by clear and con(cid:173)vincing evidence. \"(B) The term 'natural gas' means any product (other than crude oil) of an oil or gas well if a deduction for depletion is allow(cid:173)able under section 611 with respect to such product. \"{C) The term 'domes\u00b7tic' refers to petro(cid:173)leum from an oil or gas well located in the United States or in a possession of the United Sta\u00b7tes. \"(D) The term 'crude oil' includes a nat(cid:173)ural gas liquid recovered from a gas well in lease sepair.a.tors or field facilities. \"(E) The term 'regulated natural gas' means domestic natural gas produced and sold by the producer, prior to Janua.ry 1, 1976, subje.c\u00b7t to the jurisdiction of the Fed(cid:173)eral Power Commission, the price for which has not been adjusted to reflect to any ex(cid:173)tent the increase in liaibility of the seller for tax by reason of the repeal of percentage de(cid:173)pletion. Price increases subsequent to April 10, 1974 shall be presumed to take in(cid:173)creases in tax liabilities into account unless the taxpayer demonstrates the contrary by clear and convincing evidence.\" (c) EFFECTIVE DATES. The amendment made by subsections (a) and (b) of this sec(cid:173)tion shall apply to oil and gas produced on or after January 1, 1974. Mr. MAGNUSON. Mr. President, high prices have created tremendous windfall profits for oil companies. The size of the windfalls is so large the numbers are hard to grasp. The Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation estimates 1974 profits on domestic oil production alone will be $9 billion after taxes. These windfall profits are in large part at(cid:173)tributable to taxpayer subsidies of the oil industry. It is time Congress insists that the oil industry pay their fair share of taxes on their increased profits. I am pleased to join with Senator RIBICOFF and Senator JACKSON in an amendment to H.R. 8217, the vessel re(cid:173)pair tariff bill, to restore equity to the energy tax system. Senator RIBICOFF, Senator JACKSON and myself propose that the Senate act to repeal the oil and gas depletion allowance immediately. This huge tax loophole has outlived any usefulness it may have had. Simple jus(cid:173)tice requires taxpayers no longer subsi(cid:173)dize the industry that is reaping windfall profits far in excess of anything our Na(cid:173)tion has ever before experienced. Immediate repeal of the oil depletion allowance, effective January 1, 1974, as we propose, would yield $2.6 billion more revenues this year than a phased-in re(cid:173)peal such as proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee. By 1980, the total difference between immediate and phased repeal of depletion will total $80 billion. These extra windfall profits are not needed to finance future oil and gas ex(cid:173)ploration. The Joint Committee on In(cid:173)ternal Revenue Taxation estimates the industry is limited to investing a maxi(cid:173)mum of 50 percent of recent profit in(cid:173)creases. Immediate repeal of depletion will still leave an average $1.50 per bar(cid:173)rel increase in profits over 1973, as a price incentive for expanded exploration and development. Depletion allowances have not stimu(cid:173)lated exploration and development. To the contrary, a Library of Congress study concludes they have stimulated overdrilling of existing fields. Further, depletion allowances significantly re(cid:173)ward large domestic producers out of proportion to the rewards received by smaller producers. Worst, during today's energy shortages, depletion allowances actively discourage capital expenditures and cheaper, more abundant energy sources such as coal liquefaction, oil shale and solar energy. The Congress must choose the most efficient incentives to encourage the pro(cid:173)duction of new domestic energy supplies. The existing tax subsidies are inefficient incentives and, in fact, often act as dis-incentives. Where tax subsidies do have an effect on oil producers, they create out-of-pocket transfers from taxpayers to producers. Depletion was originally designed to allow producers to recover the loss in value of oil as they took it out of the ground. \"Cost\" depletion can be con(cid:173)sidered analogous to ordinary business depreciation. Percentage depletion, on the other hand, results in producers re(cid:173)covering the value of oil wells 16 times over. Inefficient tax subsidies to oil producers cannot be justified during times of wind(cid:173)fall profits. Domestic oil prices have more than doubled over the past year and the price of domestic crude oil continues to rise. The President's energy message calls for a tax on windfall profits. I, and other Members of the Senate, have called for a price rollback. It is unconscionable to argue that tax subsidies are needed to further increase oil profits today. The current windfall profits in domes(cid:173)tic oil production can be entirely attrib(cid:173)uted to price increases in foreign crude oil. In 1972, domestic crude oil was more expensive than foreign crude oil. Today, foreign crude oil has a posted price in excess of $10 per barrel. Domestic crude oil production costs average less than $3.50 per barrel. New domestic crude oil is being sold at foreign crude oil prices. Domestic producers are reaping a $6.50 per barrel windfall because of foreign oil price fixing. Repeal of the oil deple(cid:173)tion allowance would reduce this wind(cid:173)fall by about $1.50 per barrel. So immedi(cid:173)ate repeal of depletion will still leave massive increased profits as a price in(cid:173)centive to attract capital for expanded oil and gas production. There is no better time for the Senate to consider repeal of this tax loophole than in the context of tax relief for the ordinary consumer. I am proud of my record in consumer protection. Consum(cid:173)ers have grown increasingly more frus(cid:173)trated as oil industry profits skyrocket, energy supplies grow short, and the oil subsidy burden on the common taxpayer increases. Repeal of the depletion allow(cid:173)ance, effective January 1, 1974, will yield $19.4 billion more revenues by 1980, than the Ways and Means \"oil tax reform\" bill. This money is readily available for redistribution to hard-pressed taxpayers. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join me in this effort. The time to act is now. The choice is simple. Does the Senate wish to maintain unconscionably high windfall profits for oil companies, or does the Senate wish to provide tax equity for the ordinary workingman?

            "654": "14516 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE May 14,, 197h are v.ent the urge for personal enrichment from destroying more important things that have been handed down to us by our history. The great ~V,s that assail our country the result \u00b7'of a situation of reckless cha.nae in values which, drawing away from a pr~per balance between what must be kept and what must be discarded, rushes on like a torrent demolishing everything tllrough the frustration, the impatience or ba.d faith of many. It is essential to stop that tm:rent if we do not want to lose the most valuable assets of our national heritage. Let us put a stop to public and private cor(cid:173)ruption, to drugs and prostitution. Let us put a stop to violence. This is all the result of the importation of false goals and of the inability of homes and schools to devote themselves to the great process of educating Costa Ricans at a time of crisis which is peculiar to the transition of our society. The task cannot be achieved by the person in office alone, but by the entire country. Today we have paid homage to a national athlete, the young girl Maria del Milagro Paris, because in my opinion she is the symbol of what Costa Rica's youth should stand for: effort, sacrifice and patriotism. That is the School that must be formed, both by the parents in each home and by teachers in grade and high schools. Let us not blame our social vices on young people who commit offenses; let us blame ourselves, as a generation, for not having given deep thought to what we used to have and to how we have changed, in order to realize that we have repudiated what was our own to implant modes of conduct that have warped our society. There is still time. I call on every Costa Rican father and mother to join with the powers of the State and devote all of our efforts to one single goal: rescuing our na(cid:173)tional heritage. People from other areas and from other countries give the impression of having dis(cid:173)covered Costa Rica. They have come and they have shown us what we had. They at(cid:173)tach great value to what we did not appre(cid:173)ciate. Let us listen to them attentively and we will hear them speak of clean air; of crys(cid:173)tal-clear water in our creeks, rivers and seas; of weather; of mountains, of valleys and of plains, and of the unpretentiousness of Oosta Rican homes, where hospitality and human solidarity still prevail. But there a.re other persons from those same countries and areas who come here and try to deceive us with false coins, to destroy what we have, disrespecting our laws, our environment and our culture. These per(cid:173)sons-whether they are entrepreneurs, in(cid:173)vestors, diplomats, intellectuals, or simple tourists-will not be received. On the contrary, those who wish to come with their families, to struggle side by side with us in our national crusade for preserv(cid:173)ing and improving what we have, wm be wel(cid:173)come irrespective of race, religion or politi(cid:173)cal beliefs. This is no invention of mine to(cid:173)day. It is merely paraphrasing what our an(cid:173)cestors announced when they founded this republic. , The Costa Rican society of the future will be not only the result of economic and tech(cid:173)nological transformations, nor of our effort to preserve aspects of our culture that we consider to be important. It is also indis(cid:173)pensable to renew and perfect the political system of our democracy. All over the world it may be observed that the old ideas about representative de(cid:173)mocracy do not satisfy the needs of the times. New administrative and political thought has replaced the legal forms that our ancestors patiently discussed to orga(cid:173)nize the State. If this new thought is not adopted, the very survival of the democratic regime could well become seriously jeop(cid:173)ardized. This has happened in countries tn America and Europe. a I al ways cherished the idea of calUng a National Constituent Assembly that, with care and without haste, would discuss the changes needed in our country, mainly in the field of State organization. Some groups opposed this idea: some o! them !or !e~r of losing economic privileges, others for fear of losing social advances. It seems to me advisable to focus our at(cid:173)tention this year on a study of the changes in the structure of the State and, if it is deemed advisable, all of the political groups could discuss the possibility of calling Constituent Assembly, or of proceeding grad(cid:173)ually to introduce partial amendments into our Constitution. In the meantime, I have tallced with the Magistrates of the Supreme Electoral Court in order that, with the least possible delay, we undertake a revision of our electoral sys(cid:173)tem which is already outdated to handle the number of voters we have today. I believe that the present system is the result of a number of measures to prevent fraud, which have piled up to the point to represent, in many cases, powerful obstacles to the cast(cid:173)ing of votes. With the new technology and mechanization used in countries similar to ours, the electoral system must be revised to make it as easy as possible for citizens to cast their vote. For many years, and as part of our ideas on the need for change, we have recognized that our prospects are inadequate if we re(cid:173)main isolated, and we have made efforts to expand the economic space for our country's development. We cannot foresee our develop(cid:173)ment except in terms of Central America. During the past weeks I have personally talker\\ with the Heads of State and chief leaders of our sister countries and I can state today that the long struggle by sin(cid:173)cere Central Americans is beginning to bear fruit. There is a yearning for peace between the countries at odds. The Presidents of Hon(cid:173)duras and El Salvador recognize the urgency to consolidate an honorable peace, as a prior requisite to revise the economic integration of the Isthmus. Great efforts are being made to bring to(cid:173)gether the Heads of State of Central Amer(cid:173)ica to hold talks and seek solutions. I har(cid:173)bor the most ardent hopes that we will be able to do this in Nicaragua before this month is over, to start the task of meeting frequently, without protocol or formalities, and face the task of saving the Central American economic community, in which we permanently include Panama. The men who have worked toward these ideals in governments and in regional orga(cid:173)nizations have my sincere congratulations ias a Central American, and my unstinted sup(cid:173)port for their ideals. Having kept our trade wlth Central America at levels that are quite high and continue to grow rapidly from yea.t to year, is a national asset that we owe to these men in both the private and the public sector. I express my thanks to all the workers and entrepreneurs who, notwith(cid:173)standing a fratricidal conflict already five years old, have kept Central America united in the ideals of development and change thiat are possible only with a regional outlook in(cid:173)creasingly stronger and increasingly broad. The lack of fairness in the system of in(cid:173)ternational economic relations continues to be one of the main obstacles to greater suc(cid:173)cess in our efforts toward change, transfor(cid:173)mation and progress. Costa Rica is going through its greatest social crisis in a quarter of a century. It had to be so. The structures on which the economic systems of the large countries after World War II had been built made them vulnerable. Food became scarce ,and oil became scarce, and the crisis began. But this time, the blow fell not only on the back of small peoples; the citizens of rich countries also felt on their own flesh the whip of scarcity and of inflation. The United Nations Conference on Raw Materials and Development, the new Dialogue started in Tlatelolco and continued in Washington, and the latest meeting of the General Assembly of the OAS, mark the proper direction toward solidarity and inter(cid:173)national justice. Our position of support for the countries of OPEP, although it is costly to us, is based on the assurance that they will make common cause in our struggles, as the American chancellors did recently in Wash(cid:173)ington, when a badly informed group of North Americ\u2022an workers opposed the as(cid:173)pirations of peoples that have made pos(cid:173)sible-to a lesser or greater extent-the well(cid:173)being they enjoy. This same feeling of solidarity compelled the Foreign Ministers of La tin America to proclaim in Bogota, in Tlatelolco and in Washington, their support to the Republic of Panama in its struggle to\u00b7 reconquer its full sovereignty over the Canal Zone, and to ne(cid:173)gotiate with the United States a fairer Canal Treaty. I wholeheartedly support the proposition made by President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela in his Inaugural Address when he stated: \"it would be a great homage to the Fathers of Latin American Independence that this Panamanian claim could be achieved and celebrated on the next 7th of December, when we shall commemorate the 150th Anniversary of the Congress of Pan(cid:173)ama\". In this struggle, since 1950, Mr. Jose Fi(cid:173)gueres, the former President, has stood out more than anybody else. Costa Rica and the developing countries recognize that it was he who started the struggle for fair interna(cid:173)tional prices, with his letter of that year to the FAO Conference in New Delhi. The struggle has already taken a world(cid:173)wide turn. Oil producers joined under OPEP and have shown their strength. Bauxite pro(cid:173)ducers joined in Conakry and a struggle has started to organize and to improve interna(cid:173)tional conditions and prices of aluminum. Next came coffee, cacao and sugar. In New York, the countries of the third world managed to ca.ll a Special Meeting of the UNO to set up the bases for a fairer in(cid:173)ternational economy. The Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of the States, proposed by the President of Mexico, Lie. Luis Echeverria, continues to be our goal. Ex-President Jose Figueres must continue in that struggle. As soon as I set up my Government, I will ask him to give a few more years to Costa Rica and to the world, in the struggle for an international system for justice and social improvement, the only basis on which worldwide peace can be built. As the Representative of the President of the Republic of Costa Rica, and by his own worth, Ex-President Figueres will be able to carry forward, at world forums and confer(cid:173)ences, a banner that he has carried, witl1 foresight and valor, for a quarter of a cen(cid:173)tury. The society of the future, the shaping of which will be a permanent effort of my Gov(cid:173)ernment, cannot be based on national efforts that will only serve a few, or that will con(cid:173)solidate unfair social systems. We have a long way to go to attain a harmonious develop(cid:173)ment: man, land, capital and culture must go hand in hand, or the inequalities of growth will inevitably bring the explosions of change. It is not fair that, in the Costa Rica of today, there should be a palace alongside of a shock. This is an invitation to those who have nothing, to take justice into their own hands. Costa Rica has no right to have pal(cid:173)aces, nor is it fair that those who have a for(cid:173)tune through the efforts of all, should make aggressive ostentation of their opulence. The entire political and fiscal system of the Nation must be aimed at having accum(cid:173)ulated income reinvested so as to create more work and more wealth, and to pave the way ",

Mr. ALLEN. No, I would respectfully disagree with the distinguished Senator, because it has the second factor of in(cid:173)cluding two-thirds of those children in families receiving AFDC over the amount of the Orshansky formula. So that is be(cid:173)ing cranked in. What the Senator from Alabama is objecting to is what the Senate commit(cid:173)tee does in not only counting the chil(cid:173)dren under Orshansky, but also counting them again if they fall under the AFDC, so that one child could be counted on two occasions. It is not just a composite mix of formulas in coming up with one for(cid:173)mula; it is the counting of one child two times that the Senator from Alabama objects to. Mr. WILLIAMS. Well, as the McClellan amendment proceeds, as the cost of liv(cid:173)ing increases, we will be moving inexor(cid:173)ably in the direction of eliminating that other part of the formula, AFDC. That has to be the nature of things, unless we have a reduction in the cost of living, which I would hope we might see but it is not realistic. Mr. ALLEN. Why should the children be counted twice, is what the Senator from Alabama does not understand. Mr. WILLIAMS.. Because there are so many who were not counted at all in the census figures, for one reason. We do know the annual census of needy children under AFDC. And we do know the number left out in the basic census figures was large indeed. It has been estimated that as many as 5 million fam(cid:173)ilies were left out. Mr. ALLEN. Why did the Senator bring the bill back to -the floor based on the Orshansky formula, if, as he is now pointing out, it is not a proper formula? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. ALLEN. Hearing no yield the floor. Mr. WILLIAMS. Excuse me. Was that directed to me? Was there a question tome? Mr. ALLEN. What was my question? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques(cid:173)tion will be repeated by the Reporter. The Official Reporter (Grant E. Perry) 1\u00b7ead as follows: answer, I Why did the Senator bring the bill back to the floor based on the Orshansky formula, if, as he is now pointing out, it is not a. proper formula? Mr. WILLIAMS. That is a very worthy question, and, believe me, we have been under great pressure to have this bill here long before this, and we have been on a search for what I would consider a better approach than Orshansky, par(cid:173)ticularly now that v.e are faced with Orshansky almost pure in this amend(cid:173)ment. Quite !rankly, this administration did not come up with figures that would guarantee the most equitable distribu(cid:173)tion. We do not have it in the bill, but it is a lot more equitable, I would sug(cid:173)gest, in the bill the committee brought out than in this single approach of the faulty Orshansky formula. Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, is any time left in opposition to the amendment? The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes remaining. Mr. JAVITS. I yield myself 10 minutes. Mr. President, it is very interesting to me how the text of the amendment it(cid:173)self defies a good many of the arguments made in its favor as against the amend(cid:173)ment of the committee. For example, with all the decr.ying of the AFDC chil(cid:173)dren as a proper element in the formula, it is a fact that Senator McClellan's amendment cranks in, not all the AFDC children above the poverty level, but only two-thirds of them, as if there were two(cid:173)thirds of a poor child. Nonetheless, they are cranked in, so there must be some self-consciousness in the author of the amendment that this is an essential ele(cid:173)ment of the situation. I will come back to that in a minute. Also, Mr. President, with all the de(cid:173)crying of a base year, the fact is that though they very considerably reduced the effect of the base year, they cranked that aspect in, too, in an altered form(cid:173)to wit, 85 percent of the preceding year hold harmless, and then after that 85 percent in the preceding year. Now, Mr. President, one other thing: We are proceeding, in respect of this amendment, against a tradition, here, which has established a 100 percent hold harmless situation in respect of this very Federal aid to education. That was con(cid:173)tained in the first continuing resolution for the current fiscal year, and was con(cid:173)tained also in the fiscal year 1974 Labor(cid:173)HEW appropriation, the definitive ap(cid:173)propriation which obtains for this fiscal year. Finally, Mr. President, to go further with it, we are told that in order to get precision, definiteness, we have to adopt the McClellan amendment; but the Mc(cid:173)Clellan amendment puts us more than ever on an uncharted sea. Let us just take one example of that. It is argued that the Orshansky formula is definitive for those children, and that the AFDC formula is indeterminate. But the fact is that it is complained, for ex(cid:173)ample, according to an Urban League es(cid:173)timate, that the Orshansky formula, which is based upon the 1970 census undercounts the poor children by 5.3 million. That is an infinitely bigger mar(cid:173)gin of error, Mr. President, than even 40 percent of the children under AFDC, which would amount, on that basis, to something in the area of 3 million, even if you took it on its face. The reason, Mr. President, for crank(cid:173)ing in the AFDC formula, as we do and the McClellan amendment does-exactly the same thing in terms of acceptance of the principle-is that the Orshansky is a static index. We only change it every 10 years based on the census. That will not be for 9 years to come, whereas AFDC is a moving index. It changes all the time, depend(cid:173)ing on the group of children concerned and their poverty area. So I think this is critically important because taken at its face, it is still very good until we begin to break it down. 3,000 One other thing that is critically im(cid:173)portant to break down and that is the global figure. Let us remember that the global figures taken here, by eliminating the two gifted provisions-parts B and C-relating to incentives to the States to do better in education and the un(cid:173)usually high concentration of low(cid:173)income children, are eliminated so that the global sum used in the McClellan amendment becomes a greater sum. Cer(cid:173)tainly, no matter how we slice it, the individual amount distributable under that formula would appear to be greater. The figures are given by States, but the money is not distributed by States. This is the key fallacy which I hope the Senate will carefully scrutinize. The money is not distributed by States but by local educational districts. So the State may, in a global sense, look good, but the State is not the entity that gets the money. The entity that gets the money is the local educational district. When we break that down into local educational districts, according to the formula proposed by the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. McCLELLAN), we find that 600 counties out of some counties in the Nation will receive less in :fiscal year 1975 than in the current fiscal year. This, to me, is the real nail that should be driven into the internment of the Mc(cid:173)Clellan amendment, the point about the populations. We are talking about people, the population of those 600 counties as compared with the population of the other 2,400. That will give us a real meas(cid:173)m\u00b7e of what this means. The 600 counties are disadvantaged. They include the pri(cid:173)mary metropolitan areas of the country. This country is no longer rural. Seventy-five percent of our people live in urban areas. Practically every State has .an important metropolitan area. So those are the very key reasons why such diverse entities as the American Federation of Labor, the National Education Associa(cid:173)tion, the American Federation of Teach(cid:173)ers, and the United Automobile Workers of America, all espouse the committee's formula, because taking everything to(cid:173)gether it did the best justice. In addition, it obeyed and conformed to the tradition which we have established, because of the shifting nature of the formula bases, the tradition of a hold-harmless formula based on the preceding year. Finally-and we shall have more time to debate this, I do not want to take more than the time allotted to me at this mo(cid:173)ment-there is one more critically im(cid:173)portant fact that I should like to point out. It is a very popular sport, Mr. Presi(cid:173)dent, on the floor of the Senate-and I have been here .a considerable time and I have heard it countless times and have seen the game played time and time and time again-to point the finger at New York. Look at ~ew York. Look at what has happened in New York. Look at what New York is getting. When we do that, let us remember that no matter what we do, New York is the State that will always be ahead. Take the McClellan formula or any other formula and New York will still get a lot of money. The McClellan formula gives New York the most of any State. It gives New York ",

Let me assure the gentleman that while we have given specific references of the improvement of train facilities as far as the east and west coasts are concerned, both areas of the country have benefited by this. The improvement in the use of long-haul trucks in permit(cid:173)ting them to be utilized for hauling goods back from the point of origin, where in the past they have not, is certainly of national benefit. It is not restricted to that particular area of the country. There are studies from the National Commission on Pro(cid:173)ductivity working with the Grocery Man(cid:173)ufacturers Association which is working with local legislators to improve produc(cid:173)tivity in the grocery distribution and handling business. It is certainly not pro(cid:173)vincial in its character whatsoever and I suspect they work in the State of Iowa as well as other States. Mr. GROSS. I might as well advise the gentleman from Georgia that my wife has not reported to me that she can trace any benefits back to this Commission in(cid:173)sofar as her shopping at the grocery store is concerned. Mr. ASHLEY. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. GROSS. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio. Has the State of Ohio bene(cid:173)fited too from this organization? Mr. ASHLEY. Yes, I would say so. The Commission has been working with units of local government not just in the State of California or in the State of Ohio but also as a matter of fact on a rather broaa. scale, so I think the ques(cid:173)tion with respect to the Commission's parochial interest is not well taken. Mr. GROSS. Of course when one starts dealing with the bureaucrats he will find that they will say they work for anybody anywhere, any plaice around the world. But let me get down to a case or two with the gentleman from Ohio. What has been accomplished by this Commission in the last few months? How has this outfit lived for the last few months? Have they had money to spend? What have they been doing? Mr. ASHLEY. We know that the legis(cid:173)ation is necessary. Mr. GROSS. No, no. I am talking about their operations late last year and up to this point this year. What have they been living on? Mr. ASHLEY. My understanding is that they have been working in coopera(cid:173)tion with the Cost of Living Council and have been funded in part on the basis of supplementary appropriations. Mr. GROSS. From December 23 to February of 1974 I hear they have been \u00b7 using temporary 60-day appointments, 10 from the staff were detailed Treasury and 10 to the Cost of Living Council because the outfit did not have enough money to run on. What is the story? How has this boondoggle been operating up to this point? Mr. WIDNALL. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. GROSS. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. WIDNALL. Mr. Chairman, I be(cid:173)lieve what the gentleman stated is cor(cid:173)rect. I am not admitting it is a boon(cid:173)doggle because I believe it is not. They did use temporary 60-day appointments and the work has been very effective. Ten of the staff were detailed to Treasury and 10 to the Cost of Living Council from December 23 through February 1974. Mr. GROSS. Where do they get money to operate if they have accomplished anything, and I do not believe they have, in the last few months? Mr. WIDNALL. In February 1974 to the present, the National Commission function as such was phased out. The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen(cid:173)tleman from Iowa has expired. (By unanimous consent, Mr. GRoss was allowed to proceed for 3 additional minutes.) Mr. WIDNALL. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield further, the Office of Productivity was created within the Cost of Living Council under authorities contained in the Economic Stabilization Act. Ten people were assigneq to this office. Temporary assignments were not renewed. Since April 30, the Cost of Liv(cid:173)ing Council has been closing down un(cid:173)der temporary authority. to Mr. GROSS. Yes, so they have been living hand to mouth and what in the world have they accomplished? And with respect to expenditures, no matter who paid the bill, what have they been ac(cid:173)complishing? Mr. WIDNALL. They have not been able to accomplish very much because of the opposition from the gentleman from Iowa and a few others, and because of that the Commission have been living hand to mouth. Mr. GROSS. The point is that they have not accomplished anything. I hear nothing except two or three Members arising from the State of California to claim they have accomplished anything of a tangible nature, and I am not con(cid:173)vinced they have accomplished very much in that State. There is nothing in this report to show any record of accom(cid:173)plishment on the part of the Commis(cid:173)sion. There is no recommendation on the part of any other agency or depart(cid:173)ment of the Government that this out(cid:173)fit ought to be continued. Mr. ROUSSELOT. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. GROSS. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. ROUSSELOT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am happy to report to the gentleman that there are other areas of the country that have benefited from this Commission. I want to show the gentleman a report I hold in my hand that has produced a good resume of their 1973 activity. On page 53 they discuss the work of this Commission with the Chicago Construc(cid:173)tion Coordinating Committee which was set up in the city of Chicago to deal with and wrestle with the problems of in(cid:173)creased productivity in the construction field. They made recommendations to that committee. I can acknowledge the gentleman that the building industry in the city of Chicago has acknowledged that this has been helpful in trying to put a better handle on productivity in the construction industry in Chicago; so that the answer to the gentleman's gues(cid:173)tion is that this was a specific activity. It did not just come into play spon(cid:173)taneously. Mr. GROSS. We have Commissions, Councils, and advisory boards running out of our ears in this Government. Mr. ROUSSELOT. I understand that. Mr. GROSS. Why must we spend $5 million or even $2.5 million more on still another Commission when we have them running out of our ears? We have a Labor Department that ought to be interested in productivity. What in the world are we doing with an(cid:173)other outfit of this kind for the tax(cid:173)payers to pay for and wet nurse? Mr. ROUSSELOT. Will the gentleman yield further? Mr. GROSS. Yes. I yield further the gentleman from California. Mr. ROUSSELOT. I could not agree with the gentleman more. I think there are an awful lot of unnecessary commis(cid:173)sions in this Government. I joined him in the past in opposing continuation of many of these. to to ",
            "804": ".14666 EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS May 14, 1974 Sources of methanol.-The potential or a low temperature storage flask. Methanol, on the other hand, can be blended with gaso(cid:173)line and used in existing automobiles with(cid:173)out the necessity for major modification to the automobile engines. The methanol picture may be summarized as follows: 1. Methanol as an automotive fuel could be helpful in easing the present energy crisis. 2. The most promising source of methanol is coal, and there is more than enough coal on hand to provide the methanol required for this purpose. 3. Very little is being done now by the Fed(cid:173)eral Government to provide funding for re(cid:173)search and development or to otherwise pro(cid:173)mote the use of methanol. 1. Methanol as a /uel.-Methanol is a wide(cid:173)ly-used chemical, with current annual United States production running roughly 1 billion gallons per year. Its properties, handling problems, etc., are the,refore well known. The work done by Reed and Lerner and by others shows that methanol is compatible with gasoline, and can be added to gasoline 1n amounts up to 15 per cent and used in exist(cid:173)ing automobiles without the necessity of modifying the automobile engines. Blends containing more than 15 % methanol are also satisfactory but require a carburetor ad(cid:173)justment. 2. sources of methanol can be grouped into three broad classifications: (a) Natural gas (methane) , ( b) Coal and related substances such as lignite, ( c) Less-developed sources such as wood, sewage, animal wastes, and the like. These sources can be thought of as being available in a time sequence, with methanol available now from natural gas, in the near future from coal, and in the more distant future from wood and waste prod(cid:173)ucts. For the purposes of this analysis, we have concentrated on coal. Natural gas is a petroleum-based product, and thus the use of methanol from this source would not be helpful given the present situation of short(cid:173)ages, embargoes, etc. (However, Dr. Reed, one of the co-authors of the Science article, sug(cid:173)gested that conversion of natural gas to methanol for shipping purposes might be a useful short-term method of obtaining use(cid:173)ful fuel from the Alaskan oil fields before the pipeline is completed.) The advanced methods of obtaining methanol, from wood, from sewage, etc., were not considered useful enough in the near future to warrant analysis. With regard to coal, the adequacy of the supply of methanol from this source is shown by the following rough calculation: The United States consumes roughly 100 billion gallons of gasoline per year in pri(cid:173)vate automobiles. Assume that 10% meth(cid:173)anol were to be used, and that this consump(cid:173)tion rate remained constant. Ten billion gal(cid:173)lons of methanol would then be required. (Dr. Reed regards a 10% methanol mixture as more satisfactory than a 15% mixture.) Ten billion gallons is approximately equal to 60 billion pounds, or 30 million tons of methanol required. Dr. Reed believes that the efficiency of converting coal to methanol would be about 50%. Therefore, in order to obtain 30 million tons of methanol, 60 mil(cid:173)lion tons of coal would be required. Since the Nation now produces 570 million tons of coal per year, only a little over 10% of our coal output would have to be converted to methanol in order to obtain enough meth(cid:173)anol to provide a 10 % mixture for all Amer(cid:173)ican automotive needs. Dr. Reed estimates that it would cost 5.67 cents per gallon to convert coal to methanol, and that the methanol thus formed would be cheaper than gasoline. His data indicate that the gasoline-methanol mixture provides more power than does gasoline alone, al(cid:173)though theoretically the addition of meth(cid:173)anol should cause a reduction in available power. He believes that this discrepancy could be accounted for by the methanol causing the automobile engine to function more efficiently, although he cautions that there are other researchers who disagree with his conclusions on this point. 3. Governmental activity. Federal activity concerning the use of methanol as an auto(cid:173)mobile fuel would appear to be minimal. It would seem that the possibility of using methanol in this manner was not taken seriously until Drs. Reed and Lerner pub(cid:173)lished their article in Science magazine. The National Science Foundation, which has a group looking into the possibilities of vari(cid:173)ous advanced fuels, has now begun to take an interest in methanol, and is going to sponsor several conferences on the subject during the summer. It would seem that methanol is an idea whose time is just be(cid:173)ginning to come. work and limit the volume of goods and serv(cid:173)ices business can sell, regardless of price. We have seen the distortions that stem from controls; we have had shortages where none existed before-shortages which couldn't be blamed on the energy crisis or the Arab oil embargo. The answers to inflation and shortages are reduced government spending and in(cid:173)creased production. Farm prices appear to be coming down as signs point to record produc(cid:173)tion of food and feed grains. Increased out(cid:173)put and productivity can have similar effects thruout the economy. But this will require restraint. Business must limit price increases deliberately, at least until shortages are over(cid:173)come and competition restored. Labor, where there is no effective competition, must always exercise this restraint. Now that we have put our economy back in the hands of the marketplace, we should do what is necessary to keep it there. GOOD RIDDANCE TO CONTROLS HON. ROBERT P. HANRAHAN OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, May 14, 1974 Mr. HANRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, Amer(cid:173)icans have been quite pleased with the discontinuance of the Economic Stabili(cid:173)zation Act. This expired on April 30 to the pleasure of most citizens. I wish to in(cid:173)sert the following article which appeared in the Chicago Tribune for the benefit of my colleagues. [From the Chicago Tribune, May 4, 1974] Goon RIDDANCE TO CONTROLS Few Americans are mourning the passing of the nation's first--and perhaps last--ex(cid:173)perience with peacetime controls on wages and prices. Not many are celebrating, either, because they are busy coping with the \"double-digit inflation,\" which means in(cid:173)flation at a rate of 10 per cent or more and which is, in part, a legacy of the controls. Barely had the Economic Stabilization Act expired before Harry Bridges called his west coast longshoremen out on a brief strike to emphasize their demand for a 30 per cent an hour cost-of-living raise in wages. Major copper producers didn't even wait. They in(cid:173)creased the price for copper cathode by 12 cent to 30 cents a pound, American Express Co. increased its annual credit card fee by $5 and said the new $20 fee will apply to re(cid:173)newal cards expiring in early summer. No doubt other companies and labor unions will seek price increases and wage increases in the weeks ahead. They will ra(cid:173)tionalize their actions by arguing that the controls limited their ability to keep pace with rising costs and prices. As a result the nation will face an additional bulge in post(cid:173)con trol prices and wages. John T. Dunlop, director of the Cost of Living Council, has warned that contrary to the expectation of many adminstration econ(cid:173)omists, inflation in the second half of 1974 will not show much improvement from the first half. If he is right, the inflationary spiral for all of 1974 is likely to exceed the 8 per cent rate set last year. Unless business and labor leaders act \"responsibly\" in a control-free economy, President Nixon told the Chamber of Com(cid:173)merce of the United States, \"the demand for controls will again come up and be reflected in the Congress.\" . The gross national product in real terms dropped nearly 6 per cent in the first quar(cid:173)ter, while inflation by the broadest measure climbed more than 10 per cent. Clearly a continuation of this pattern will lead to a recession that will throw thousands out of SALUTE TO GAYLE T. MARTIN HON. ALPHONZO BELL OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, May 14, 1974 Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday evening, May 23, at Lococo's Restaurant in Manhattan Beach, a testimonial din(cid:173)ner will be held for my friend, Gayle Martin, the city manager of Manhattan Beach. Gayle Martin was born in Alva, Okla., and grew up in western Colorado where he attended grade school and high school. He attended the University of Colorado where he received a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1940. He later attended the University of Michi(cid:173)gan under a Navy postgraduate program studying naval architecture. He received his M.S. degree in public administration from the University of Denver in 1952. Mr. Martin started his professional career as an engineer with the Babcock & Wilcox Co., where he worked until entering the Navy in 1942. He received a direct commission as an ensign and re(cid:173)ported for active duty in September 1942. He served on active duty in a number of assignments until September 1949, when he returned to inactive duty only to be recalled to active duty for the Korean war to serve until June 1952. While on active duty Mr. Martin rose to the rank of lieutenant commander. After his release to inactive duty he re(cid:173)mained active in the Naval Reserve and progressed rapidly in rank with his mili(cid:173)tary career being climaxed by his selec(cid:173)tion as a rear admiral in February 1968. Admiral Martin maintained a very active status in the Naval Reserve until his re(cid:173)tirement on June 30, 1973, culminated 31 years of duty with the NavY. Mr. Martin's career in city manage(cid:173)ment started in Phoenix, Ariz., where he took a 1-year internship in city manage(cid:173)ment in the office of the city manager. His first appointment as a city manager came in November 1952, in Deerfield, Ill. In 1954 he became manager at May(cid:173)wood, Ill., and in November 1956, he was appointed as city manager in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where he has served for the last 1 7 % years. ",
            "854": "14716 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE May 15, 1974 a manufacturer at some time refused to comply with FDA's \"voluntary\" recall request. For this reason, I am today introduc(cid:173)ing legislation which will authorize the Secretary of Health, Education, and Wel(cid:173)fare to halt the sales and distribution of food, drugs, and cosmetics adulterated or misbranded in a manner which pre(cid:173)sents an imminent hazard to the public health and to require their recall or de(cid:173)struction, as may be appropriate. Correspondence that I have had with the Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency on the subject of vinyl chloride is appended. The correspondence follows: U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, Washington, D.C., April 4, 1974. ALEXANDER M. SCHMIDT, M.D., Commissioner, Food and Drug Administra(cid:173)tion, Rockville, Md. DEAR DR. SCHMIDT: I read with interest the Clairol Inc. announcement that it was re(cid:173)call1ng from the nation's store shelves about 100,000 cans of aerosol hair spray, some con(cid:173)taining a chemical recently linked to a rare form of liver cancer. It was reported in the press that the cosmetic concern said that the request for a voluntary recall had come from the Food and Drug Administration fol\u00b7 lowing reports that at least 10 industrial workers exposed to the chemical, vinyl chloride, had developed angiosarcoma. While I applaud the voluntary action taken by Clairol Inc. I am at a loss to understand why the FDA would, in a case where it be(cid:173)lieves the public safety is endangered, rely on a voluntary action and not insist on a mandatory procedure. I should like to be appraised of how that determination, a vol(cid:173)untary as opposed to a mandatory action, was reached and what the considerations were in making that decision in this particular matter. I should also like to know whether any measures have been taken with respect to any other uses of the vinyl chloride chemi(cid:173)cal now linked to liver cancer and if so, what those measures are. Sincerely, EDWARD I. KOCH. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, Rockville, Md., April 18, 1974. Hon. EDWARD I. KOCH, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. DEAR Ma. KocH: Commissioner Schmidt has asked me to thank you for your letter of April 4, 1974 concerniing the Food and Drug Administration's request for a \"Volun(cid:173)tary\" recall of certain aerosol hair sprays manufactured by Clairol Inc. due to the pres(cid:173)ence of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) . we are sending letters to all other manu(cid:173)facturers and major distributors of aerosol cosmetics requesting that they also recall any of their cosmetic products which contain VCM as a propellant. Reviews by our scientists of the available toxicological and epidemiological data indi\u00b7 cated that VCM may be dangerous when ex \u2022 posure is by the inhalation route. Based on these findings we concluded that these areo(cid:173)sol cosmetics which contained VCM as a pro(cid:173)pellant represented a potential health haz(cid:173)ard and therefore should be removed from consumer channels as soon as possible. The only statutory instrument available to the Food and Drug Administration under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to get such products out of commerce is seiz(cid:173)ure. Although seizure is a valuable tool, which does not require any voluntary action on the part of the manufacturer, it does have major limitations. The most significant of these limitations is the time required to im-plement a seizure action. This time-delay .is compounded severalfold in situations, such as this, where numerous lots of products have been distributed nationwide. A separate seiz(cid:173)ure action against each lot of goods in each different locale would be necessary. Much of the defective products would be further dis4 persed before they could be located by the FIOod and Drug Administration and seizure implemented. Recall is usually a much more efficient and practical means for reversing the chain of product distribution. The recalling firm usu(cid:173)ally has readily available all data with re(cid:173)spect to quantity of products manufactured and/or distributed, names and addresses of customers and other pertinent identifying information. A notification to customers to return any defect! ve merchandise can there(cid:173)fore be accomplished in a minimum of time. Recall is especially preferable to seizure situations where potentially hazardous prod\u00b7 ucts are involved and speed in retrieval is all important. We must point out however that the Fed(cid:173)eral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act contains no provisions which authorize this Agency to require or insist that a manufacturer or dis(cid:173)tributor recall any products. Due to the nature of the hazard involved with these aerosol cosmetics, we felt that recall was the most appropriate means of assuring a rapid removal of these products from the market. Clairol Inc. initiated this recall only after we advised them to do so. We were prepared to issue public warnings and institute seizure actions if the firm had not responded fa(cid:173)vorably to our request for recall. We hope these comments are helpful to you in assessing the merits of our decision in this instance to request that these aerosol cosmetics be recalled. Please let us know further assistance. Sincerely yours, ROBERT C. WETHERELL, if we can be of any in Acting Director, Office of Legislative Services. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINXSTRATION, Rockville, Md., April 19, 1974. Hon. EDWARD I. KOCH, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. is DEAR MR. KocH: This is in further response to your April 4 letter regarding the vinyl chloride issue. Commissioner Schmidt signed on April 16, 1974, a. Federaz Register notice which when published in final form wm effectively ban vinyl chloride as an ingredient in drug and cosmetic aerosol ;.>roducts. In a companion Federal Register notice signed by Commlssioner Schmidt on April 15, the Food and Drug Administration re(cid:173)quiring under the authority of the Drug List(cid:173)ing Act of 1972, a list of all human drugs which are being manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded or processed for commercial distribution and which contain vinyl chloride whether or not the vinyl chloride is an active or inactive ingredient, and a list of all human dr-ug products pack(cid:173)aged in vinyl chloride containers with poly(cid:173)vinyl chloride liners. We anticipate that these documents will be published in the Federal Register on April 22 or soon thereafter. Advance copies of these documents are enclosed for your information. We wm keep you apprised o! any further actions we plan to take with respect to this issue. Sincerely yours, ROBERT C. WETHERELL, Acting Director, Office of Legislative Servtce8. A similar letter was sent EPA: U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, Washington, D.C., May 8, 1974. Hon. EDWARD I. KocH, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. DEAR MR. KOCH: Thank you for your let(cid:173)ter of April 4, 1974, concerning EPA action against pesticide products containing vinyl chloride as an aerosol propellant. As you may know, on April 24, I did sus\u00b7 pend the registrations of pesticide products containing vinyl chloride .as a propellant which were registered for indoor. use. The suspension order, which went into effect -im(cid:173)mediately, prohibits the further distribution, sale, or use of the affected products. At the same time, I requested that all existing stocks of these products be recalled. You ask why the issuance of such an or\u00b7 der was delayed, and why the Agency, at least for a. time, sought voluntary action to pre\u00b7 vent further sale of the product. The issu(cid:173)ance of a. suspension order must be predi(cid:173)cated upon a determination that such action is necessary to prevent a.n imminent hazard during the time required for cancellation (Section 6(c) (1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act). At the time of our first news release requesting volun(cid:173)tary recall of products by the manufacturers, data. concerning the extent and duration of the exposure which could result from the use of such aerosol pesticide products was lacking. The other human and experimen(cid:173)tal data available to the Agency linked ex(cid:173)posure to vinyl chloride gas and angiosar(cid:173)coma of the liver only after substantial re(cid:173)peated and continued exposure. The finding of an imminent hazard, then, would have been tenuously based at best. Since that first press announcement on April 17, however, preliminary EPA tests have indicated that during a typical spray of a vinyl chloride-containing aerosol, the user could be exposed to significant levels of the gas. The tests and subsequent calculations further indicated that residues of the gas could remain in an enclosed area for some period of time, albeit at lower levels. The results of these experiments, coupled with additional results from animal tests, made the case for suspension of these products considerably stronger. I should emphasize, though that we are stm uncertain as to the health risks associated with the short term exposure to vinyl chloride gas such as is pro(cid:173)duced by the use of an aerosol pesticide prod\u00b7 uct. As I stated in the suspension order, how(cid:173)ever, based on the newly acquired test results, \"it is prudent to assume that any exposure at these levels will have increased the risk of cancer should the strongly suspected causal relationship between vinyl chloride and cancer be finally confirmed\". I enclose a copy of the order itself, and copies of our two press releases on vinyl chloride actions. As to general action taken by the Agency with respect to vinyl chloride, I established a Task Force on February 14, 1974, under the direction of the Director of the Office of Toxic Substances, to examine the broader issue, including air and effluent emission standards. I enclose a copy of the press release outlining the operation of the Task Force. We are now collecting and monitoring data and other in4 formation which wm enable us to evaluate the need :for further action under the other authorities of the Agency. We appreciate your interest in the vinyl chloride issue, and assure you that we share your concern for the safety of the consumer. Please let me know if I may provide further information.

Well, it isn't that. Since he has at least had some private discussions, but they haven't yet been in the Grand Jury forum, so I have to respect those. HP. I think that is right. P. So that was your suggestion, at least, that we should not do anything on Dean at this point. HP. I think that is right. I think you ought to just let him sit. P. All I have is just information(cid:173)HP. That's right. P. basically from you and from him, but it is information the gravity of which I just can't judge until I see whether it is corroborated. HP. You have to treat that as private, in any event. P. Private, don't I? Yeah. And for that rea(cid:173)son if !\u00b7were to move to do it--so I think we are in the right position and, then, fine. OK-Then I won't expect any more from you today. I won't bother you. HP. No. I am a little concerned about Sen(cid:173)ator Ervin's Committee. They have just, under the agreement Kleindienst worked out with Senator Ervin, have called the Bureau and asked to see the interview statements of Magruder, Porter, Sloan and La.Rue. P. Oh, my (expletive removed}. HP. Ah, and I feel like I am sitting on a powder keg there, but I don't feel like I can dare go to Senator Ervin until I get a definite commitment from Magruder. P. Yeah, yeah. On Magruder, what's wait(cid:173)ing besides the Committee with him? Oh, the deal with the DC jail and-HP. Well that is right and whether or not the Judge is going to clap him in right away, and whether or not the Committee is going to put pressure on him. P. In otherwords, you think-you haven't yet tried to talk to Ervin? HP. No, Sir, and I don't want to until I can tie him down. P. TU you've got him tied? I get it. HP. Well, I've got to be able to say that I am coming out with something public in terms of a charge. P. I see. Right, right. HP. You know, have a valid basis for ask(cid:173)ing him to slow it up. P. OK. Well, in any event, I am glad you thought the statement went well. I worked on it to be sure that it didn't compromise anybody one way or the other and as you noticed too I put the immunity thing. It leaves the ball in your court, but--HP. I noticed. P. But on the other hand, I had to express the view because basically people are going to ask me, what about Mitchell, what about, you know, a lot of people and you know I just can't be in this position. HP. I agree wholeheartedly. P. Lower people are different. But you know, upper people, you know, they might think I am protecting (unintelligible) HP. I agree. P.OK. HP. Alright, Mr. President.

            "954": "14816 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE May 15, 1974 busing orders look like Rube Goldberg handiwork. The only difference is that despite their complexity, the Goldberg drawings made some sense in the end. The same cannot be said for these out(cid:173)landish busing plans. Those who support busing rely heavily on the arguments of social egalitarians that busing will improve the education level of minorities. These days I think that is the chief argument for busing: That there must be busing of schoolchildren so they will all have equal opportunity so far as edu(cid:173)cation is concerned, and that it will ex(cid:173)pedite integration as required by the Brown case. Well, busing has been with us for a decade now. Let us take a look at the re(cid:173)cord. What has busing accomplished? And what has it failed to accomplish? First, let us consider the education pic(cid:173)ture. Proponents of artificial ratios and balances would have us believe that such arrangements will increase\u00b7 the learning ability and the educational achievement of the minority student. Factual evidence now indicates the contrary. As explained in a recent Washington Post article by William Chapman: The old attitudes have been bent by the weight of evidence emerging from many professional studies of the classroom effects of integration. The old education went something like this: 'Blacks get unequal edu(cid:173)cation because their schools are unequal. Given equal access to the tools of education with whites, they will perform like whites. They will learn to read and write more quickly. They will shed old feelings of in(cid:173)feriority and low aspirations.' Each element of the equation is seriously undermined by the studies of the late 1960s. There are rougly a dozen studies of busing and its net effect on several com(cid:173)munities throughout the Nation. The consensus is that busing has not im(cid:173)proved educational skills. In fact, there are a number of instances where it has only served to make things worse. One of the major studies was done in 1972 by that eminent sociologist, David Armor of Harvard. Armor found no con(cid:173)sistent evidence of educational improve(cid:173)ment as a result of busing. As a matter of fact, he found considerable proof of adverse effects upon the students who were bused. Armor's findings were updated in 1973 by Prof. Jeffrey Leech of the Indiana University Law School. Leech confirmed every major point in the original Armor report. Furthermore, Leech states: Thus the most recent sociological evidence fails to confirm a basic premise underlying the rationale of court-ordered busing; i.e., that it will positively affect the academic performance of minority children. Another major report, prepared in 1966 by James S. Coleman, found that school integration, in itself, had very little effect on the academic achievements of blacks or whites. These and other studies show that, contrary to the claims of busing pro(cid:173)ponents, academic progress is not achieved by busing. And what about the other aspects of education? What about extracurricular activities? And for many youngsters, these activities are particularly valuable in their social and psychological devel(cid:173)opment. There is no way a child who at(cid:173)tends school miles away from home can stay after school to participate in group activities or vaJ..uable tutoring sessions. These are very important aspects of education, and they are completely ig(cid:173)nored by the great social organizers in the busing dispute before us. Furthermore--and this is a very im(cid:173)portant point-busing prevents family and community participation in the stu(cid:173)dent's education process. What I mean by that is that I have had all manner of parents who complain that they are unable to participate, at least the way they used to do, by belong(cid:173)ing to parent-teachers organizations and the communication that goes on between parents and teachers in the educational process. This has been changed, and in some cases totally wiped out in the case of some parents, who cannot drive across town to attend these meetings. As a result, all three suffer-the stu(cid:173)dent, his family, and the community. Studies made in the Headstart pre(cid:173)school program found no visible improve(cid:173)ment in the child if the parents were left out. The parents must be involved; the communities must be involved. Stu(cid:173)dents should not look upon the class(cid:173)room part of his education as something strange--something which takes him far away from home--something which does not relate to his neighborhood and fam(cid:173)ily environment. In conclusion, then, as far as educa(cid:173)tional benefits are concerned, busing has been a failure, and in some cases a mis(cid:173)erable failure. Now let us take a look at another mainstay in the pro-busing defense: bus(cid:173)ing will speed integration and smooth racial tension. There have been many major studies on this factor, and the studies show just the opposite from this argument. Both Armor and Leech found that bused pupils had a higher degree of ra(cid:173)cial antagonism than those not bused. Ironically, opPosition to busing is what unites black and white; while busing it(cid:173)self merely increases tension and racial polarization. Flareups in tension-filled schools have caused physical harm and material dam(cid:173)age. Buses have been burned in Pontiac. There has been student violence in Char(cid:173)lotte, N.C. Those are just a couple of examples. There are many all over the United States. There are some in my State of Florida. It certainly is not the way to smooth race relations. I have had teach(cid:173)ers tell me that sometimes it is all they can do in these days of busing simply to maintain order in the classroom. They have a hard time doing that, and teach(cid:173)ing and education have gone out the window. I would venture to say that on this count, as with educational achievement, busing is not the answer. Now I would like to speak to the issue of busing costs, which I think is impor(cid:173)tant. Proponents of widespread busing do not like t.o talk about the price tag for these social game plans, and with good reason. As if the taxpayers did not have enough demands on their dollar, the courts have given them yet another punch in the purse. In Charlotte-Mecklenburg, about $1 million annually has been added to the schools' operating budget. In addition, taxpayers had to sell out $1 % million in capital investment for additional buses. Finally, there is an annual tab of $250,-000 for contracts with the local city bus company in addition to the schoolbuses that have been purchased. In Prince Georges County, estimated costs for forced busing amount to an annual cost of $1,325,000. School officials in Kalamazoo spent $4 million implementing their busing or(cid:173)der-and lost 20 peTcent of their student enrollment, even when they spent that additional money. Taxpayers in California were saddled with astounding financial obligations as a Tesult of widespread desegregation or(cid:173)ders in connection with schoolbusing. For openers, there was an initial out(cid:173)lay of $42 million. Subsequent annual outlays drop to a mere $20 million. The list goes on, but the point is clear: We are financially strapping our taxpay(cid:173)ers and our school districts to pay for what I call the folly of the social plan(cid:173)ners, backed up by court orders. And what about education? Channeled into productive areas, this kind of money would mean a big boost in the educa(cid:173)tional standards of any school district. No wonder the taxpayers around the country, again and again, have been de(cid:173)feating bond issues for school districts. This money should be going where it will really help improve educational ben(cid:173)efits for all children. It should go to teachers' salaries, modern classrooms and equipment, and special remedial programs. I know, too, that the added tax bur(cid:173)dens bear heavily on the retired and the elderly. I hear this time and again from many of my Florida constituents, and I think it's high time we did something about this. Now another aspect of busing costs which should concern all Americans is the energy factor. With the fuel situa(cid:173)tion being what it is, it is inconceivable to me that we can even consider all this busing up and down a school district or throughout a county. In North Carolina, the excess busing burden means an annual waste of at least 1.1 million gallons of gasoline. Oklahoma City's busing plan con(cid:173)sumed 350,460 gallons above normal this year alone. In this area, neighboring Prince Georges County uses about 750,000 gal(cid:173)lons annually to comply with busing orders. And Richmond used some extra gallons of gas this year. This loss of precious fuel is even more tragic when we consider what was hap(cid:173)pening to the rest of the Nation as the buses rolled along. Americans were asked to turn down their thermostats, to cut back on energy-using devices, and con(cid:173)serve in other ways. Fuel for cars, when it was available, required hours of wait-530,000 ",
            "1004": "rl4866; CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE May 15, 1974 . dressing the question of how we deal with a problem that does exist-and there is no question that it does exist. The Senator's own State has suffered from Court-ordered plans. Certainly my State has. I cannot speak for his, but I surely can for mine. The record is re(cid:173)plete with examples of absolute tragedy in the lives of the children of my State. I do not see how I can stand before this body or the people of Tennessee and say I am simply not going to take care of something that is so damaging to the lives of the people of my State. Yet what the Senator from Indiana would ask us to do by voting for his amendment is to refuse to exercise our constitutional responsibility by voting on what we do mean by equality of oppor(cid:173)tunity. If the Senator does not like the Gur(cid:173)ney amendment, let him off er something that will address the problem, but not offer an amendment which would, if adopted, deny Senators the privilege of voting on the Gurney amendment up or down. That is where I find fault with the amendment. We have been on this route too many times. It is about time that the Senate faced up to its responsibility by voting on the merits of the case. Mr. GURNEY. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. PELL). Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I have studied the amendment of the Senator from Indiana. What disturbs me is the emphasis on the words \"de jure.\" I re(cid:173)member the discussion on the Stennis amendment and all the wounds that were opened up then, which I had hoped had been laid to rest, and which would be opened up again by the words \"de jure.\" If it were \"de jure\" and \"de facto,\" it would be different. For that reason I feel compelled vote against the amendment. Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I would be glad to change it to include all segrega(cid:173)tion, but the reason the words \"de jure\" were emphasized is that only de jure seg(cid:173)regation has been dealt with by the courts, or by Congress, as far as that is concerned. Mr. PELL. I think reference to it does open up many wounds that we had hoped were almost healed over. Mr. GURNEY. Mr. President, I would like to point out that in Indianapolis, one of the principal cities of the State of the author of this amendment, the Court plan would take 20,000 students out of Indianapolis and send them into the suburbs, many miles outside the city, at a cost of many millions of dollars. In addition, this Court plan proposes to close down a total of 29 elementary and high schools, all under the Supreme Court plan. This amendment, this sub(cid:173)stitute proposed by the Senator from In(cid:173)diana, will not do anything to stop that business at all. My amendment will stop that business because what it is designed to do is to preserve neighborhood schools and stop massive busing all around Indi(cid:173)anapolis. I say that this is a probusing amend(cid:173)ment. It refuses to allow the Senate to face up to its duty and vote up or down on the question of whether we will have neighborhood schools or will have busing. to I get the message extremely clearly that the Senator from Indiana does not agree with my amendment. However, he has a simple way of expressing himself on that, because he can vote nay on that amendment when it comes up, and allow other Senators to vote as they desire on the amendment yes or no, instead of re(cid:173)sorting to this ploy. I think the Senator from Tennessee used a little better expression when he used the term \"copout.\" \u00b7 However, this kind of amendment, which has no meaning at all, and is en(cid:173)tirely meaningless, is designed to pre(cid:173)vent the Senate from voting for a good, broad antibusing, neighborhood school amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The Senator from Indiana has 5 min(cid:173)utes remaining. Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I have great respect for the Senator from Florida. He has great wisdom. However, I suggest to him that he should confine himself to what has happened in the State of Flor(cid:173)ida, not to what has happened in the State of Indiana. As a matter of fact, I have spent a good deal of time and studied the prob(cid:173)lems of Indiana a little more closely than did my friend the Senator from Florida. I suppose that if I were going to \"cop out,\" as the distinguished Senator from Tennessee calls it, I would vote for the Gurney amendment. That would make many people in Indianapolis happy. That would make the school board happy. They were not opposed to busing when they were busing black children past white schools and white children past black schools. I think that situa(cid:173)tion is bad whether it is in Florida, Ten(cid:173)nessee, or Indiana. My amendment would apply in the in(cid:173)stance of Indianapolis, in the inner city of Indianapolis, the Indianapolis public school system. All my amendment would do would be to instruct the Indianapolis school board to come up with a plan to provide for integrated schools, a plan that uses as small an amount of busing as possible, and to explore and study the situation with respect to providing a plan that would result in adequate, integrated edu(cid:173)cation. Mr. MATHIAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Colby King, Terry Barnett, and Quincy Rogers, a member of the staff of the Judiciary Committee, be granted the privilege of the floor during the debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I think it is rather obvious what the Senator from Tennessee is after, because I have stud(cid:173)ied that constitutional amendment that has been advertised around my State and all over the country as being an antibus(cid:173)ing amendment. It does not even contain the word \"busing.\" It does not contain the word \"transportation.\" It goes back to the old segregation system that we fought a civil war to prohibit. Maybe the Senator from Tennessee can support that as an anti(cid:173)busing constitutional amendment. the However, I cannot accept it. Under his plan, nobody would get equal oppor(cid:173)tunity. The\u00b7 amendment may gain votes for some Senators. Talk about a copout, I am not the one who is copping out. Mr. BROCK. Mr. President, will Senator yield? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen(cid:173)ator from Indiana has 2 minutes remain(cid:173)ing. There is no other time available. Does the Senator from Indiana yield back his time? Mr. BAYH. No; if I have 2 minutes remaining, I will use it. I will use it to suggest that if my voice got a little loud when directed at the Senator from Ten(cid:173)nessee or the Senator from Florida, I hope that they will not interpret that as an assault on their integrity or on their desire to do what they think they are accomplishing. I happen to think that their amend(cid:173)ment is designed not to stop busing, but to give the school boards the tools to take us back 100 years. I do not want separate-but-equal any(cid:173)thing. Mr. GURNEY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Florida. Mr. GURNEY. Mr. President, I cer(cid:173)tainiy did not think that the Senator from Indiana was assaulting\u00b7 my in(cid:173)tegrity. I did think that he was assault(cid:173)ing my amendment. Mr. BAYH. The Senator from Florida is exactly right. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques(cid:173)tion now recurs on the amendm'ent. Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? (Putting the question.) There is not a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were not ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques(cid:173)tion now recurs on the amendment of the Senator from Indiana (Mr. BAYH). Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, a parlia(cid:173)mentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen(cid:173)ator will state it. Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, in the unanimous consent request, was this amendment not located, as far as a vote is concerned, just prior to the vote on the Gurney amendment, to take place at 5 o'clock? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen(cid:173)ator is correct. Mr. GURNEY. Mr. President, as I re(cid:173)call, we attempted to work out a unani(cid:173)mous-consent request. However, I do not think that we ever did. Is that correct? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is advised that there is a unani(cid:173)mous-consent agre\u00b7ement. The question now recurs on the amendment of the Senator from Florida. Who yields time? Mr. ERVIN. Mr. President, I was un(cid:173)der the impression that I was going to be permitted to have some time on my am\u00b7endment at this time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator .from North Carolina that he understands that by previous order the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina will be called up at 4 o'clock. ",
            "1054": "1-!916 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE May 15, 197 4 lunch counters and another barrier to equal(cid:173)ity, symbolic as it was, fell before the on(cid:173).slaught of nonviolent protest. What the Supreme Court had lacked the power to accomplish in the schools was be(cid:173)ing accomplished by King's shock troops in the restaurants and hotels, the public beaches and the bus stations. It was 1961 before it became apparent that the movement for black equality was splitting into two-strains, and that the dis\u00b7 dain for integration-not ta.ken seriously be(cid:173)fore-would one day prove to be a powerful force in black America. The Freedom Riders swept down on the South, with blacks and whites riding buses from town to town, getting off here and there to test the segregated waiting rooms and rest rooms with their \"white\" and \"col(cid:173)ored\" signs. At Anniston, Ala., one afternoon in the spring of 1961, a white mob attacked the bus, set lt afire and slashed its tires. The photograph of the mob's handiwork went around the world. In New York City, that photograph showed up as a. pamphlet with a caption asking: \"Do you really want to integrate this burn(cid:173)ing bus?\" A different version of social revolution was starting to capture the imagination of Northern urban youth who had neither the patience nor background for King's form of love for his enemies. There was Robert F. Williams, a. North Carolina NAACP leader who led a group of armed blacks to chase some Klansmen out of town. Within months, Williams was run out of the country, to Cuba and China, but the notion of stiff resistance was to have another leader in Minister Malcolm X of the Nation of Islam, or Black Muslims. A former convict who had found the teach(cid:173)ings of Islam while in prison, Malcolm X preached a hard line against integration on the street corners of Harlem and soon had a. massive following among young Northerners, slum dwellers and collegians alike, who ques(cid:173)tioned King's posture of nonviolence in the face of attack. The crucial test came in Birmingham in the spring and summer of 1963. King led the civil rights movement into full battle against the resistance of Public Safety Director \"Bull\" Connor. Connor turned fire hoses and police dogs on King's unresisting marches one day in the full view of television cameras. With the powerful impact of that scene on world opinion and with the support of such patri(cid:173)archal figures of the civil rights movement as A. Philip Randolph and Roy Wilkins, King organized a march on Washington to demonstrate the sentiment of \"all decent Americans\" in favor of a. civil rights law that would carry out the sentiments express(cid:173)ed by the Supreme Court nine years before in Brown. Nearly a quarter of a million Americans came to march. They heard one of the most eloquent speeches of its kind: \"I have a dream,\" said King, and the Mall went wild with cheers. It was perhaps the high point of King's career as a spiritual and moral leader, and the high point, too, of the non(cid:173)violent movement. Less than a month later, at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, a bomb went off during Sunday school and four little girls were killed. In an era in which brutality against blacks had been common(cid:173)place, and in which many black churches had been destroyed by bombs, that sickening Sunday stood out in many minds as a psy(cid:173)chological turning point against the non(cid:173)violent movement. By the time the first decade of Brown had ended, there was deep dislllusionment in black America. The noble language of the court had not translated into tangible change. What had seemed so simple had turned out to be profoundly complicated. Brown had exposed the deep hypocrisy of racism and demonstrated that attitudes and behavior were far more difficult to change than most blacks had ever imagined. Rather than share their schools with the blacks who had been denied access, many whites fled the cities for the suburbs, leav(cid:173)ing those cities in a state of decline. The harder blacks tried to strive forward, the stiffer the resistance seemed to become. The major civil rights legislation of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 showed some early promise, but the enduring legacy of racism was not to be so easily overturned by court rulings and laws. Only a few days after passage of the Voting Rights Act, the Los Angeles commu(cid:173)nity of Watts exploded with a new form of urban racial violence. From the ashes of Watts, a new awareness emerged in black America. Malcolm X, who had been assassinated that February, became larger in death than he had been in life. His warning that blacks and whites could never become one nation seemed to have sunk in. Nothing was changing for the black man in the job market, in education or in housing. So Watts set the stage for the urban rebellion-an expression of anger that swept across the cities, an uncontrolla(cid:173)ble wild fire, for the next five years. At each turn, it became clearer that blacks were determined to choose a different course, a. course of their own. Black nation(cid:173)alism among the young became more popu(cid:173)lar than at any time since the movement of Marcus Garvey in the 1920s. By 1967, the goal of integration that had so strongly attracted so many blacks was all but forgotten. \"Black Power\" was the new slogan, replacing \"We Shall Overcome.\" Instead of integrated schools, the inten(cid:173)tion of those who brought the suits in Brown, community schools became the goal. And it was not just schools, but the whole social structure. Many blacks no longer wanted what the white man had. They wanted a world of their own. And young angry voices arose declaring they were ready to fight for it, to die for it. They were called Panthers and Libera.(cid:173)tors, cultural nationalists and political na(cid:173)tionalists. They called on their brothers and sisters to look toward Africa, to think of themselves as part of the Third World, merely trapped in the belly of the Ameri(cid:173)can whale. Even those older blacks who con(cid:173)sidered themselves middle class could not resist the emotional tug of the new ideology so far awQ,y from the language of Brown. Even as the country's attention was fo(cid:173)cused on those dramatic changes, less dramatic changes were occurring elsewhere. Throughout the South and the North, blacks were trying to get the\u00b7ir hands on some of the power that resided within the system. From a. ha.If dozen blacks in the Congress at the time of Brown, the number inched up to 12, then 16, enough to have a caucus of their own and be taken seriously. In Mississippi and Alama.ba, Georgia and Tennessee, blacks in increasing numbers were getting elected to state office. At the time of Brown, you could count all the black elected officials on your fingers. Now there are nearly 3,000, many of them in the Old Confederacy. It is not progress with a capital P, but neither have blacks been standing still. What Brown has done is to expose a series of con(cid:173)tradictions in American society! Thurgood Marshall, the man who argued Brown, is now an associate justice of the Su(cid:173)preme Court. Harry Briggs, one of the fathers for whom he argued, was forced to leave Clarendon County, S.C., for the Bronx, N.Y. More blacks than ever are earning over $15,000 a year, but more blacks than ever are living at the poverty line. The black faces flash across the television screens, giving the news or acting in a com(cid:173)mercial, but less than 3 per cent of television news professionals are black. The antagonists of racial equality rail against the \"liberal\" press for its advocacy of equal rights. Yet, only seven-tenths of one per cent of all the newsroom professionals in the United States today are not white. And so it goes, a little progress here, stub(cid:173)born resistance there; a bright spot, a dark spot, hope, despair. It is impossible now to predict what will be reasonable to say on the 25th or the 40th anniversary of Brown. Only this is certain: Hardly anyone guessed how much America would change, for good or ill, in the 20 yea.rs since that muggy May Monday when the Supreme Court pronounced that separate but equal was not good enough. A COURT THAT DARED THE UNKNOWN [From the Washington Post, May 12, 1974] (By John P. Ma-cKenzie) \"Somewhere, sometime to every principle comes a moment of repose when it has been so often announced, so confidently relied upon, so long continued, that it passes the limits of judicial discretion and disturbance.\" So said John W. Davis, lawyer for a South Carolina school district and courtroom spokesman for the status quo in Southern race relations. He was telling the Supreme Court that whatever it might think the 14th Amendment meant in 1953 and 1954, the jus(cid:173)tices should be guided by the pronounce(cid:173)ments of 1896 and subsequent years approv(cid:173)ing \"separate but equal\" as a constitutional doctrine. When the Supreme Court handed down its famous and unanimous desegregation deci(cid:173)sion of May 17, 1954, there were more causes won and lost than Davis' or that of his op(cid:173)ponent, Thurgood Marshall. Seen across two decades, the decision appears to have been the breakthrough for an entirely new judi(cid:173)cial approach, a major restructuring of Amer(cid:173)ican government. The judicial branch has not been in \"repose\" since then. In the longer view, the rule of Brown v. Board of Education, coming on the heels of decisions opening up state-financed college and professional education to blacks, was an evolutionary, logical next step and noth(cid:173)ing radical. The major new element was that the court had lost its fear of the unknown. Fear of breaking the 1896 precedent of Plessy v. Ferguson was partly rooted in re(cid:173)spect for the past and partly in fear for the future. What social upheavals would deseg(cid:173)regation cause, what violent reactions, what administrative nightmares would the judi(cid:173)ciary be calling down upon itself? OTHER BATTLES Once engaged in the battles over racial justice, the Warren Court looked upon other battlefields with less . awe. The \"political thicket\" appeared more manageable and the justice saw legislative apportionment not as a \"political question\" but as a denial by politicians of the political rights of Amer(cid:173)icans. Looking under the rocks of the crimi(cid:173)nal justice system, the court found viola(cid:173)tions of the constitutional rights of indi(cid:173)viduals and hastened to outlaw them. To the John Davises and others the court had slipped its moorings and was so \"ac(cid:173)tivist\" that a judicial dictatorship seemed imminent. But to a host of other Americans, the court was opening a new avenue of re(cid:173)dress for disadadvantaged and forgotten citizens. Richard M. Nixon, who as vice president haid hailed Brown as the work of \"our great Republican Chief Justice,\" was anxious as President to call a halt to the activism and restore what he called ''strict construction\" of the Constitution. But three of his four appointees ended up voting to uphold federal court judgments against state antiabortion laws. And Chief Justice Warren E. Burger led a charge into the religious arena, pro(cid:173)claiming that the only \"entanglement\" to be feared was government a.id entangling the state and religion. ",

Here I really found myself at a loss. To follow one student's schedule, I had to go from ground floor to second floor for the first class; then down a long, narrow hallway and then down(cid:173)stairs again for the next class. This was the general pattern. Assembly is held in the gym with spectators seated in the balcony(cid:173)reached only by stairs. As I traveled through my day, I found other barriers. Suppose I were downtown and suddenly felt ill? There was a public tele\u00b7 phone nearby-but I could not use it!! I could not get my wheelchair through the narrow door into the booth, nor could I reach either the coin-box or dial. Buying groceries isn't difficult for most people. How about a wheelchair bound per(cid:173)son? At one store, there were self-opening doors which helped me feel competent. What if there had been revolving doors or even the usual 32\" doors separated by an upright divider? I might have gotten through, but I would have had another set of skinned knuckles to show for my effort. Another ob(cid:173)stacle I found in stores which I visited was the placement of many articler. I could not reach high enough to \"buy\" many items; and I could not lean down far enough to pick up others without tumbling headfirst out of the chair. Light switches in many buildings were out of reach; drinking foun(cid:173)tains and bathroom fixtures were definitely not designed for a wheelchair inhabitant. I found that automatic elevator doors (us(cid:173)close in 7 seconds) trapped me when I tried to enter in my wheel~hair. Our post-office can be reached only through the climbing of stairs; many libraries are de(cid:173)signed with impressive stairway entra.nces; aisles in stores and many other public places are so narrow or so crowded that it is difficult to move through them. What if I wanted to watch a football game? Bleacher or grandstand seats are definitely out. After a long and tiresome day, I decided to head for home. Here I had more prob\u00b7 lems. In the parking lot, my car was parked well within the defined parking lines and so was the car next to mine. But, there wasn't enough room allowed between cars for me to wheel myself into position to swing my(cid:173)self into my car. The occupant of the other car noticed my predicament and care.fully backed out so that I had extra room. Even then, it took all my strength and effort to get into the car. Then I learned that even though had a folding wheelchair, many cars are not designed for wheelchairs or vic(cid:173)tims. Many cars a.re-or can be-modified to eliminate the use of foot power for clutch, brake, and gas feed, but since this has just been \"one day on the job\" for me, my car was standard. After a. day like this, I have a much bet(cid:173)ter understanding of the obstacles and frus(cid:173)trations faced by a wheelchair confinee; and hope that in my chosen work, I will be more thoughtful of disabled persons. Today, I have \"walked with my bro';her',, and it's terribly hard to \"walk\" in a wheel(cid:173)chair. ually set to I I ANOTHER \"GUERRILLA ACTION\" AGAINST ISRAEL HON. LESTER L. WOLFF OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, May 15, 1974 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Speaker, another black mark of shame and outrage was written into the history books this morn-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS ing in the Middle East. Another \"guer(cid:173)rilla action,\" another challenge to all decent human instinct. What words can react strongly enough to the mass slaughter of the schoolchildren of Maalot, Israel? What steps can civilized humanity take to eliminate the terror that these beasts have again wrought? T~se events are beyond comprehen(cid:173)sion. Even to accept the label of \"guerrillas\" for the perpetrators is to dignify them. They are butchers-the basest form of humanity. In view of recent history and the con(cid:173)demnation of Israel acceded to by our country in the United Nations, what other course is now open to the United States but for once to take a firm posi(cid:173)tion of moral leadership and outraged indignation? The children of Maalot were in no sense participants in any declared or undeclared war. They were victims of a depraved band who do a disservice to the Palestinian people. So now those na(cid:173)tions who harbor such cutthroats must be put on notice that such acquiescence will no longer be tolerated by the com(cid:173)munity of nations-they will be brought to account. And to those who would seek to repeat such actiOn.s-they must know that retribution from the civilized world will swiftly follow. May 15, 197 4 they have visited such places as the Everglades, Fla.; the Appalachian Moun(cid:173)tains; Isle Royale, Lake Superior; Padre Island, Tex., and parts of Wyoming. The final wilderness trip planned by Scoutmaster Moran is scheduled to get underway on July 5, 1974, in central Wyoming. When they return, Charles Moran will look at his Trailblazer Award, his Golden Arrow Award, and his other memorabilia-with few regrets. Mr. Speaker, although he is stepping aside as scoutmaster and will be suc(cid:173)ceeded by Dr. Joseph D. Schleicher of Lake Bluff, he will remain on the troop committee as executive director of the parents committee. Also, he will continue to operate his electrical business. Mr. Speaker, Charles Moran has gained the respect and genuine affec(cid:173)tion of campers and noncampers of all ages and generations, and is known by all to be a thoughtful, kind, generous, and compassionate human being, as well as devoted husband of the charming and totally supportive June Moran. I am proud to salute Charles Moran for his unselfish and invaluable contribution to the development of over 1,400 scouts, who are a source of strength and pride to our Nation, and I wish him much happiness and good health in the years ahead. LAKE BLUFF HONORS SCOUT(cid:173)MASTER CHARLES MORAN HON. ROBERT McCLORY OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, May 15, 1974 Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Speaker, having served some years ago as scoutmaster of Boy Scout Troop 42 in my home town of Lake Bluff, Ill., I have been particu(cid:173)larly pleased to learn that Saturday, May 18, 1974, has been officially declared \"Charles Moran Day\" in honor of Scout(cid:173)master Charles Moran. Mr. Speaker, for 20 years Charles Moran has been a central :figure of troop 42, of the North Shore Area Coun(cid:173)cil, Boy Scouts of America. During these 20 years, the troop has flourished and membership has grown from 50 scouts to approximately 70 scouts today. Mr. Speaker, Scoutmaster Moran is a lifelong lover of the wilderness. After serving as an Oregon lumberjack, he be(cid:173)came a dealer in-and repairman of major electrical appliances. Today Charles Moran is the proprietor of Moran Appliances in Lake Bluff. Mr. Speaker, in addition to training hundreds of other boys in scouting, Charlie Moran has reared his own two sons, Mike and Terry, in the scouting traditions. During this time, he has ex(cid:173)hibited uncommon imagination, forti(cid:173)tude, unique skills and qualities of wholesomeness in his leadership of scouting. He has shared his experiences with the Boy Scouts, age 11 to 14 years, accompanying them on various wilder(cid:173)ness trips across the country.

GREEN OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, May 15, 1974 Mr. GREEN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the Democratic Caucus today passed a resolution requiring Democrats on the House Rules Committee ti) make in order my amendment to the Oil and Gas Energy Tax Act of 1974. I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this resolution and my amendment which will end the oil and gas depletion allow(cid:173)ance as of January 1, 1974. The Con(cid:173)gress is now one step closer to meaning(cid:173)ful tax reform. In 1974 oil company profits are ex(cid:173)pected to be approximately $9 billion, more than double 1973's record levels. The Ways and Means Committee bill phases out the percent depletion allow(cid:173)ance over 3 years, with no phaseout in 1974, and provides various exemptions and exclusions that would continue for many oil producers until 1979. The bill would impose only a $670 million wind(cid:173)fall profits tax in 1974. My amendment will raise an additional $2.6 billion. Following is the text of the resolution adopted by the Democratic Caucus and my amendment to end the depletion al(cid:173)lowance. RESOLUTION OFFERED BY MR.

U.S. EXPORTS OF COAL AND COKE (Mr. HECHLER of West Virginia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute, to revise and extend his remarks and include extraneous mat(cid:173)ter.) Mr. HECHLER of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, at a time when coal is critically in demand to meet the Nation's energy needs, and the hills of Appalachia are bleeding from the ripping and raping by the strip miners, the United States rapidly increasing its exports of coal. Did you ever hear of anything so crazy as stepping up the exports of coal, at a time when we are suffering more and more damage from strip mining? Listen this statement by the Na(cid:173)tional Coal Association: fio is Total U.S. exports of bituminous coal in the first quarter of 1974 increased 18 percent from shipments in the same period of 1973. ... Japan, the largest consumer of American coal, took 5.7 million tons of U.S. bituminous coal in January-March, 1974; up 31.1 percent from the like period of 1973. The House Interior Committee has just reported out a woefully weak strip mine regulation bill. The strip miners say they have to keep on ripping up our own land because we need the coal. Then why in (expletive deleted) are we shipping coaJ to Japan and Europe, so they can save their own land while we destroy ours? The exporters say this is metallurgical coal used. in steel production. But the president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, Stewart S. Cort, testified on Ap1il 25, 1974, before the House Commit(cid:173)tee on Banking and Currency that the steel industry is hurting because of a severe shortage of metallurgical coal for the manufacture of steel. Mr. Cort stated that \"the supply situation has become critical.\" I urge my colleagues to support my bill, H.R. 11695 which prohibits the export of American coal, except to Canada, from whom we import oil. I am shocked to dis(cid:173)cover that we continue to export coal while continuing to destroy our own land by strip mining. The statement follows: U.S. EXPORTS OF COAL AND COKE Total U.S. exports of bituminous coal in the first quarter of 1974 increased 18 percent from shipments in the same period of 1973, although for the month of March, shipments fell 5.9 percent from the same month a year ago. In January-March 1974, exports of U.S. bituminous coal totaled 10.6 million nert tons, of which 39'1,362 tons were shipped to Can(cid:173)ada and 10.2 million tons went to overseas destinations. Japan, the largest consumer of American coal, took 5.7 million tons of U.S. bituminous coal in January-March 1974, up 31.1 percent from the like period of 1973. Exports to Eu(cid:173)rope were 3.8 million tons in the first quar(cid:173)ter of 1974, compared with 3.4 million tons in January-March 1973. All of the European Community nations, except Belgium-Luxem(cid:173)bourg, took more American coal in January(cid:173)March 1974 than in the corresponding period of the previous year. A total of 542,569 tons of U.S. bituminous coal were also exported to South America in the first quarter of 1974, up slightly from shipments in Janu(cid:173)ary-March 1973. The value of U.S. bituminous coal exports in January-March, including transportation charges to ports of exit, totaled $261.8 mil(cid:173)lion.

FEDERAL EMPLOYEE ADMINISTRA(cid:173)TIVE HEARING RIGHTS GUARAN(cid:173)TEE ACT (Mrs. SCHROEDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute, to revise and extend her remarks and include extraneous matter.) Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, on April 16, 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in Arnett against Kennedy. It is but the latest in a line of cases dealing with the prob(cid:173)lem of termination or suspension of Fed(cid:173)eral employees in the competitive service. These cases are noted primarily for their failure to answer the important and ul(cid:173)timate question whether Federal em(cid:173)ployees have a protected right to their jobs after completing the probationary period, that is, whether they can be ter(cid:173)minated or suspended without a prior hearing on the merits. The opinion in Arnett against Kennedy is similarly ambiguous on the question and offers lit(cid:173)tle hope for a person looking for a clear statement of his rights. The courts are not entirely to blame. The law is unclear because Congress has not acted unequivocally regarding pre(cid:173)termination hearings. There is no statute which clearly mandates executive agen(cid:173)cies to promulgate uniform regulations in the area. The law as it now stands leaves the whole matter of pretermina(cid:173)tion hearings for Federal employees up in the air and opens the door to agency abuse of employees who in good con(cid:173)science criticize agency procedures or dis(cid:173)close agency wrongs and coverups. There are well known cases: for in(cid:173)stance, those of Ernest Fitzgerald and Gordon Rule, employees of the Federal Government who have spoken out, been fired, and eventually won their rights to back pay and reinstatement. These cases, however, have involved employees in difficult fights and drawn out period without pay. Some agencies grant pretermination hearings; but many others do not. In those an employee must suffer without pay while he is waiting to be heard. For sure, our veterans now have a preference right to a hearing before termination, and some Federal employ(cid:173)ees, through contract, have a similar right. Many others, though, are without this fundamental protection. Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I am today introducing a bill called the Fed(cid:173)eral Employee Administrative Hearing Rights Guarantee Act. The purpose of this legislation is to guarantee all em(cid:173)ployees in the competitive service a prompt evidentiary hearing by an impar(cid:173)tial individual prior to the time that removal or suspension without pay is ef(cid:173)fective. The bill declares that certain minimum protections are due such an employee before termination or suspen(cid:173)sion, among them, the right to see the evidence supporting the action and to have a transcript of the proceedings_ I share the opinion of the many unions representing Federal employees who have contacted me--among them the Na(cid:173)tional Treasury Employees Union and the Overseas Education Association-that it is time for congressional action on this problem. As long as Congress continues ",

On page 333, line 20, strike out \"(3)\" and insert in lieu thereof \"(4) \". Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, I again thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking Republican member (Mr. JAVITs) for their cooperation. I want to can attention to the fact that this amendment is cosPonsored by Senators STAFFORD and MATHIAS. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1338, submitted for printing yes(cid:173)terday, for myself, my colleague on the Labor and Public Welfare Committee (Mr. STAFFORD), and the Senator from Maryland (Mr. MATHIAS), to the pend(cid:173)ing measure, 1.539, the proposed Ele(cid:173)mentary and Secondary Education Amendments of 1974. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my thanks to the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Education (Mr. PELL) and the ranking minority member of the committe (Mr. JAVITs) for their able and dedicated leadership on this most complex and far-reaching measure. Mr. President, the amendment I am submitting would add a new subsection to section 524 of the reported bill, which section I authored in committee with, as to various parts, Senators STAFFORD, JAVITS, and RANDOLPH, to make certain improvements in the veterans cost-of(cid:173)instruction program-VCI. Mr. President, the VCI program-a provision I authored in the Higher Edu(cid:173)cation Amendments of 1972-Public Law 92-318-was designed to provide incen(cid:173)tives and supporting funds for colleges and universities to recruit actively re(cid:173)turning veterans and to establish the kinds of special programs and services necessary to assist many veterans in re(cid:173)adjusting to an academic setting. Al(cid:173)though some 1,000 VCI programs have been successfully implemented at many institutions of higher education across the country, the limited funds which the Office of Education has made available, and certain provisions of the law have made it particularly difficult for many colleges to establish programs which meet all the requirements of the law. Consequently, during committee con(cid:173)sideration of s. 1539, I joined with Sena(cid:173)tors RANDOLPH, JAVITS, and STAFFORD in offering various amendments to the VCI ,provision. Section 524 of S. 1539, as . reported, amends the VCI program pro(cid:173)vision-section 420 of the Higher Educa(cid:173)tion Act of 1965-in two basic respects: First, the amendment in the reported bill makes the first-year eligibility require(cid:173)ment slightly less restrictive by providing that in order to be eligible for VCI funds, a school must either have a 10-percent increase in its GI bill trainee enroll(cid:173)ment-which is the present sole eligibility -criterion in terms of veteran enroll(cid:173)ment-or have at least 10 percent of its undergraduate student body composed of GI bill trainees-a new alternative criterion. Second, the amendment in the reported bill would provide for a more equitable funding procedure for eligible schools to increase the amount many smaller qualifying institutions have been receiv(cid:173)ing, by limiting to $135,000 the maximum amount of payments in any fiscal year to any single institution. Funds which become available as a result of this pro(cid:173)vision would then be reapportioned to schools which would otherwise receive a payment of less than $9,000-the esti(cid:173)mated minimum amount needed to open a full-time veterans affairs office on a campus. The reported amendment fur(cid:173)ther establishes a minimum enrollment eligibility of 25 veterans in order to avoid the funding of VCI entitlements which are too small to provide effective serv(cid:173)ices to campus veterans. Finally, the amendment, as reported, provides that not less than 75 percent of the amount of payments received by any institution shall be applied to setting up the special veterans offices, programs, and services required by the law. Current law re(cid:173)quires that only 50 percent of the VCI award be applied to setting up these vet(cid:173)eran's programs. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con(cid:173)sent that the appropriate pages from the committee report, pages 97-99-No. 93-763-be printed in the RECORD at this point: There being no objection, the excerpt . was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: SECTION 524. VETERANS COST OF INSTRUCTION PAYMENT AMENDMENTS Section 524 of the Committee bill proposes a series of amendments to section 420 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended(cid:173)the Veterans-Cost-of-Instruction (VCI) Program provision. This program was de(cid:173)signed to provide incentives and supporting funds for colleges and universities to recruit actively the returning veterans and to estab(cid:173)lish the kinds of special programs and serv(cid:173)ices necessary to _ assist many veterans in readjusting to an academic setting. Para(cid:173)graph (1) of subsection (a) of section 420 would be amended by adding an alternative prerequisite to institutional eligibility based on numbers of GI Bill enrollees. This amend(cid:173)ment has already been adopted by the Senate as section 11 of S. 896, the Education for the Handicapped Amendments of 1973. The law presently requires that a school, to be eligible for a VCI grant, must have in(cid:173)creased the number of its GI Bill trainees (including veterans receiving vocational re(cid:173)habilitation under chapter 31 of title 38, United States Code, and those receiving edu(cid:173)cational assistance under chapter 34 of that title) by 10 percent over the previous aca(cid:173)demic year. Under the amendment, a school could also become eligible if at least 10 per(cid:173)cent of its current undergraduate student body is composed of such GI Bill trainees. The new 10-percent requirement in the amendment would still impose a substantial requirement on an individual institution since the national average GI Bill trainee en(cid:173)rollment for universities, colleges, and com(cid:173)munity colleges is 8.7 percent. Preliminary figures indicate that this new clause will al(cid:173)leviate the inadvertent inequity of the pres(cid:173)ent 10-percent-GI-Bill-trainee-increase re(cid:173)quirement for a number of schools which have already made impressive achievements in enrolling returning veterans. It should be noted that mere numbers of GI Bill trainees would still not be enough to qualify for a VCI grant; under the law, a school must also establish and carry out sig(cid:173)nificant special veterans programs, including a veterans affairs office, a veterans tutorial program, a veterans PREP or college prepa(cid:173)tory program, and a veterans work/study out(cid:173)reach program. These requirements would not be affected by the amendment. A sample of schools in areas with about 25 percent of the Nation's population shows that of 1,296 schools surveyed, only 299, or 23 per cent, increased their GI Bill trainee enrollment in March 1973 by 10 percent over March 1972; 997 schools, or 76 percent, did not meet the 10-percent requirement, al(cid:173)though of this 997, 134, or 13.4 percent, did show some increase in GI Bill trainee en(cid:173)roUment. Section 420(d) would be amended by pro(cid:173)viding a more equitable funding procedure for all eligible schools. The law presently re(cid:173)quires the Commissioner to pay to each in(cid:173)stitution of higher education which has had an application approved under subsec(cid:173)tion ( c) of section 420, the amount to which it is entitled under this section. Any in\u00b7 stitution meeting the requirement of the law is entitled to payments of up to $450 for each of certain categories of veterans en(cid:173)rolled in an undergraduate program on a full-time basis or who have, in prior aca(cid:173)demic years, been enrolled in certain special veterans education programs under the GI Bill. Although VCI programs have been suc(cid:173)cessfully implemented at many institutions of higher education across the country, the limited funds which the Office of Education has m.ade available and certain provisions of the law have made it particularly diffi(cid:173)cult for many smaller colleges to establish programs which meet all the requirements of the law. The funding procedure estab(cid:173)lished by this amendment, which adds a second sentence in subsection (d), would limit to $135,000 the maximum amount of payments 1n any fiscal year to any insti(cid:173)tution, or any branch of such institution lo(cid:173)cated in a community different from that in which its parent institution is located. Re(cid:173)ports received from schools which received VCI funding for this year led to the conclu(cid:173)sion that even large schools with large num(cid:173)bers of veterans would be able to establish, and had, in fact, successfully operated, VCI programs utilizing about $100,000 of their VCI grants. Only 14 schools across the coun(cid:173)try received initial grnnts for academic yeal 1973-1974 of more than $135,000. Section 420 ( d) would be further amended by adding a new third sentence which would provide that, in making payments under sec(cid:173)tion 420 in any fl.seal year, the Commissioner is required to apportion the funds which be(cid:173)come available as a result of the new $135,-000 institutional payment limitation in such a manner as will result, first, in the receipt by each eligible institution of a total pay(cid:173)ment of at least $9,000 (or the amount of its entitlement for that fiscal year, whichever is less) and, then, additional amounts distri(cid:173)buted to all eligible institutions up to the $136,000 maximum.

            "1304": "15166 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE May 16, 1974 of past mistakes. No one can deny that in the past vocational education of young Blacks too often meant a preparation for marginal jobs, Jobs in a rural agricultural economy at the very time that our country was becoming urban and industrialized. Today we must prepare black students for jobs in our nation's total economy-not in a separate economy. Higher education must insure that Blacks are no longer faced with few occupational choices or with left-over jobs. The American economy is changing in many ways which make further demands upon American higher education. With a rapidly changing technology and an ever ex(cid:173)panding knowledge, a student graduating from college today must be prepared to fill several different jobs during the course of his lifetime. Black colleges and universities must meet this need for intermittent continuing educa(cid:173)tion through a person's adult life. The days are past when one might expect to hold only one job, or type of job, during the course of his lifetime-or his early years alone receive all his training. It is long psi.st time for the nation to give substance to this need for continuing edu(cid:173)cation. Our tax policies, our employment laws, and especially our student aid policies are geared almost entirely to a lock-step edu(cid:173)cational process. To be more relevant and responsive, the federal government should grant each individual some form of financial education credit to which he would be en(cid:173)titled throughout his life\u00b7 at a time of his own choosing or need. All of American high(cid:173)er education should make increasing pro(cid:173)visions for our nation's need for continuing and career education. Many black colleges and universities also Wish to fill a special role in the building of a strong and viable black community. The focus of black colleges on black culture and black studies is widely known. And this is good. It creates pride and an essential sense of identity. But we must not overlook other compelling interests. Compensatory educa(cid:173)tion in inner-city elementary and secondary schools and assistance in establishing black community self-help organizations and black enterprises should be important areas of endeavor by black universities and col(cid:173)leges. The greatest challenge to black higher ed(cid:173)ucation, however, has been and remains, the need for increased financial resources. While the nation expects more of black higher education, it has given it only a small frac(cid:173)tion of the resources given to white institu(cid:173)tions of higher education. The financial problems which beset all of American higher education are magnified in black higher edu(cid:173)cation. And we must remember that the spe(cid:173)cial tasks assigned to black higher educa(cid:173)tion, remedial education in particular, are exceedingly costly. There are few financial options open to black higher education. Tuition increases for most black students are unbearable. One re(cid:173)cent survey showed that almost 40% of stu(cid:173)dents in black colleges came from families With less than $4,000 annual income. Many state governments in the South where most black colleges are located, are still reluctant to grant black institutions sufficient funds. Indeed, there are instances where state governments have chosen to locate a new competing college in a com(cid:173)munity rather than strengthening an al(cid:173)ready existing black cone~. Until recently, foundations and corpora(cid:173)tions have seemed oblivious to the imbal(cid:173)ance between gifts to black and to white in(cid:173)stitutions of higher education. Even with the help of v1gorous fundraising drives such as yours here at Virgin1a Union, endowments at black institutions cannot alone acccomp(cid:173)lish what is needed. Thus, when we speak of the survival and growth of black institutions of higher edu(cid:173)cation, we primarily mean ,assistance from the federal government, in terms of both student aid and aid to the institutions themselves. For decades most of the massive federal aid to higher education has ignored the needs of black colleges-and of many small white colleges as well. Federal aid has given little attention to the fact that it costs more for a college to educate a student coming from an educationally deprived background. It has particularly ignored the great back(cid:173)log of needs found in black colleges for faculty, modern facilities, good libraries, curriculum expansion, and for a greater amount of student aid than that needed in colleges serving students from more affluent families. Most of all, federal aid to higher educa(cid:173)tion has discriminated in funding research at the cost of funding teaching. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been poured into academic research with no comparable sub(cid:173)sidies for the teaching of students. Most federal money has been directed to the \"hard\" sciences, which are expensive academic disciplines in terms of faculty and facilities. Traditionally, they have been dis(cid:173)ciplines too expensive for black colleges to fully support. Thus, our black institutions have been denied one immense block of money which has been allocated to higher education. Only in recent years has the federal gov(cid:173)ernment become more sensitive and respon(cid:173)sive to the needs of black institutions of higher education. More money has been made ,available for student aid and student loans. Beginning with the Higher Education Act of 1965, the federal government provided money for undergraduate training. The Ed(cid:173)ucation Amendments of 1972 further in(cid:173)creased the possibilities for student financial assistance creating the new Basic Education Opportunity Grants program to supplement existing student aid programs. Now the BEOG program assures every student who can gain admittance to college some finan(cid:173)cial support, if needed, but not enough. Equally important to black colleges, the federal government program for strength(cid:173)ening developing institutions was established in 1965 to provide the much needed finan(cid:173)to those institutions which cial assistance have been left out of the mainstream of American higher education. Far over one(cid:173)half of the Developing Institutions' funds have gone to black colleges and universities. In the current fiscal 1974 year the Senate Labor-Health, Education and Welfare Ap(cid:173)propriations Subcommittee on which I serve, included $100 million for this essen(cid:173)tial program. Other federal programs have made some grants to construct and develop college li(cid:173)braries and fac111ties. The National Science Foundation has made some money avail(cid:173)able for improved college science programs. Training grants have been made in the health professions. Federal aid for black higher education more than doubled between 1969 and 1972. Virginia Union alone received an increase in federal funds from $1 million in 1970 to three and one-quarter million dollars in the current school year. And as tribute to its potential and excellence, Virginia. Union received one of the largest grants the Devel(cid:173)oping Institutions program made. While black colleges enroll about 2.6 per cent of all college students in the nation, they now receive about 5.5 per cent of fed(cid:173)eral funds. This trend in federal support for develop(cid:173)ing black institutions must continue. We must discourage any slackening of effort. Even middle class parents are now finding it difficult to send their children through college because of the escalating costs of education. But we cannot resolve this prob(cid:173)lem of middle class students at the expense of those students who most need federal student aid assistance. In every instance, we must help most where help is most needed to insure each and every American an equal chance to as(cid:173)pire and achieve. Thomas Wolfe wrote: \"To every man his chance, to every man, regardless of his birth, his shining golden opportunity-to every man the right to live, to work, to be himself, and to become what(cid:173)ever thing his manhood and his vision can combine to make him-this, seeker, is the promise of America.\" You now enter the world for which your families and your university have diligently and devotedly tried to prepare you. You enter life with more hope than any generation of Blacks before you that at long last the promise of America is coming true for blaclt Americans. May you find your shin1ng golden opportunities, may you seize your chances to become whatever your vision and values combine to make. This is the wish we who gather here today have for you. Thank you. PROFILE OF A DISTINGUISHED OLDER AMERICAN Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, May is Older Americans Month, a time when every American should consider the con(cid:173)cerns of our Nation's 20 million citizens 65 yea.rs of age and older. Although we have made considerable progress over the few years toward improving the eco(cid:173)nomic and social conditions of the elderly, much more remains to be done. This month I have proposed a number of legislative solutions to the problems fac(cid:173)ing our elderly citizens, and look for(cid:173)ward to discussing and debating these measures with my colleagues. The theme this year is \"older Ameri(cid:173)cans are a National Resource.\" No where is this more evident than in an excel(cid:173)lent profile of Ray W. Smith, president of the Chicago chapter of the American Association of Retired Persons, which ap(cid:173)peared in the Chicago Sun-Times edition of Monday, May 13, 1974. Mr. Smith is a most enthusiastic and dedicated leader of the 314,000 members of AARP in Illinois. In the Sun-Times article, Mr. Smith discusses many of the concerns of his members, including the level of social se(cid:173)curity benefits and the earnings limita(cid:173)tion. He also points out a number of the association's activities, among them the youth-age alliance, a program that brings together retired person with high school or college students to exchange ideas. I commend the Sun-Times, and re(cid:173)porter David Anderson, for bringing Mr. Smith's story, and AARP's efforts, to the public's attention and request unanimous consent that the article be printed in the RECORD at this time. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD. as follows: OVER 55? HERE'S RECIPE FOR 'YOUTH' (By David Anderson) Ray W.

From a great many points of view--energy, environment, our world trade position-the increasing production and use of soybeans as a meat substitute might make a great deal of sense for the United States. To the degree that it does, then I should think the preservation of arable land for such production should be a matter of high priority. I have said, on several occasions, that the energy crisis may be the best thing that ever happened to us if it makes us realize that our energy and environmental goals are essentially the same. It should, in the proc(cid:173)ess, make us aware of something else as well: that we can't go it alone. The environment(cid:173)alists can't. The people can't. The subur(cid:173)banites can't. The farmers can't. Nobody can. That's basically what I come to say and what the land use effort is all about: we need each other-the farmers, the environ(cid:173)mentalists, the developers, the suburbanites, the city dwellers, all of us. We need to get together to take far better care of all the things we share in common-our earth, our air and water; our cities and our towns; our urban and our rural landscapes. And we need to develop far more open, democratic and effective ways of resolving the sometimes very different, but still deeply interdepend(cid:173)ent, needs and desires that we may not share. I was asked recently what kind of coun(cid:173)try I wanted to see America become by the year 2000. I said that I wanted to see a healthy en(cid:173)vironment in which the human body and the human spirit could live and thrive. But I also wanted to see a diverse environment that would offer Americans far more and better choices. Some people want to live in the city. Some people want to live in a small town. Some people want to live out in re(cid:173)mote and isolated areas. If we can begin to come to grips with the problems of land use, then I think that we can build by the year 2000 an America in which far more people have these choices open to them, and in which these choices are really worth making. MASSACRE AT MAALOT HON. JOSHUA EILBERG OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 16, 1974 Mr. EILBERG. Mr. Speaker, the mas(cid:173)sacre at Maalot, in Israel, is a crime which can only be compared to the worst atrocities committed by the Nazis and it is vital that the United States react properly. There can be no recognition of these people as the legitimate representatives of any group other than a gang of mur(cid:173)derers. Their actions represent nothing but killing for the sake of killing and their only objective can be to cause more death. The United States must take every possible action to force the gover:~n~ents which provide havens for these cr1mm~ls to change their policies. This must in(cid:173)clude the use of economic sanctions if nothing else works. Finally, it is clear that the United Na(cid:173)tions resolution of April 24 which con(cid:173)demned only Israel without even men(cid:173)tioning the murders at Qiryat Shmona EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS was taken as a sign of weakness on the part of the United States by the terror(cid:173)ists. I am supporting the resolution in(cid:173)troduced by the majority leader and the minority leader which calls upon the President to have our ambassador to the United Nations introduce a Security Council resolution condemning the mas(cid:173)sacre in Maalot. But, Ambassador Scali's instructions must also include an order to veto any resolution concerning this situation which does not indict the ter(cid:173)rorists for their acts. \u00b7 The United States must never again even appear to be in the position of sup(cid:173)porting the actions of the Arab terror(cid:173)ists. CONGRESSMAN McCLORY URGES ACTION ON METRIC CONVERSION HON. JOHN B. ANDERSON OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 16, 1974 \u00b7 Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, our colleague from Illinois, Congressman BoB McCLORY, has long been a proponent of programs designed to convert our system of weights and measures to the international metric system. Recently, Mr. McCLORY partic(cid:173)ipated as the luncheon speaker at a metric seminar in New York City spon(cid:173)sored and chaired by my constituent, Kenyon Y. Taylor, president of the Regal-Beloit Corp. of South Beloit, Ill.(cid:173)which is also in my 16th Illinois Con(cid:173)gressional District. Mr. Speaker, American industry is converting rapidly to the metric system, and our Nation alone among the indus(cid:173)trial nations of the world has yet to es(cid:173)tablish an official program of compre(cid:173)hensive and coordinated conversion to a system of metric measurements. Congressman BoB MCCLORY, who took an active part in the recent debates on the floor of this Chamber, in which the House unfortunately refused to suspend the rules and pass the Metric Conver(cid:173)sion Act of 1973, summarized the leg(cid:173)islative situation at the recent metric seminar in New York City. Mr. Speaker, some 200 business and financial representatives were in attend(cid:173)ance at the metric seminar held last Fri(cid:173)day, May 10, at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York City. I am anxious for our colleagues to have the benefit of Congressman BoB McCLORY's timely and pertinent remarks which follow: REMARKS BY CONGRESSMAN ROBERT MCCLORY REGARDING CURRENT METRIC LEGISLATION In coming to you today to report on the status of metric conversion legislation, I probably don't have much better news than is being received in the White House these days regarding the status of Congressional action affecting the President. It is entirely possible that we have underestimated the general opposition to metric legislation. On the other hand, it may be that we-in the Congress of the U.S.-have failed to serve the interests of the people of the Nation by neglecting to provide a practical and work(cid:173)able program for a comprehensive and es(cid:173)sentially voluntary conversion of most seg(cid:173)ments of our society to the metric system of weights and measures. I am sure you are May 16, 1974 all aware of the three-year study conducted by the National Bureau of Standards, under legislation passed by the Congress in 1968. It is quite inaccurate to suggest that this study was slanted or in any way deficient in its analysis of the current situation in the world and in our nation regarding the im(cid:173)pact of the metric system on our economy and our society. The report suggests the ur(cid:173)gent need for adopting some reasonable means for a changeover to the International Metric System. Indeed, the first recommen(cid:173)dation was the simple and straightforward statement that \"the U.S. change to the In(cid:173)ternational Metric System deliberately and carefully.\" Now, along with other recommendations, the report recommended that any change(cid:173)over costs shall \"lie where they fall.\" Indeed, it was stated flatly that this would encour(cid:173)age efficiency and minimize the overall cost to society. The report called for a coordi(cid:173)nated national program. As many of you know, I have endeavored to carry out these recommendations consist(cid:173)ent with the conversion to metric measure(cid:173)ments, which is occurring in this country(cid:173)steadily and rapidly, even-without any legislative mechanism whatever. The great volume of literature on the issue takes account of the rapid movement toward the metric system in our schools, in our in(cid:173)dustry, and in our daily lives. When street signs report automobile speeds and distances in terms of kilometers, when skis, cameras, film, eyeglasses, pharmaceuticals, sporting events, and contents of packages on grocery store shelves are labeled in terms of metric weights and measures, we are well on the road toward a comprehensive changeover to metric measurements. What is truly as(cid:173)tounding is that voices that purport to speak in behalf of millions of Americans in business and labor have made grossly exag(cid:173)gerated estimates of costs and have asserted their special interests in seeking to defeat legislation intended to aid all Americans. It ha.s never been my view that the Federal government should compel conversion to the metric system. On the other hand, it would seem to be one of the most appropriate func(cid:173)tions of the Federal government to provide either the mechanism or the vehicle by which the private and public sectors of our nation might voluntarily-and in an orderly and coordinated and deliberate way-proceed with a comprehensive metric conversion pro(cid:173)gram. My individual position and that of some 25 or so of my colleagues as embodied in H.R. 10720, would have established a metric con(cid:173)version board small in number with rather broad authority to work with advisory groups and private trade associations and others to help coordinate their individual conversion programs. But from the outset-(cid:173)and particularly in some parts of the 1972 legislative proposal-there were provisions for large-scale Federal subsidies, grants and loans and other provisions quite inconsist(cid:173)ent with a voluntary program in which the costs are supposed to \"lie where they fall.\" It may be that a certain amount of the momentum, which developed after the metric study report was issued in July, 1971, was lost during the period-between then and now. During the intervening period, orga(cid:173)nized labor interests--and private interests involving some industry-have developed their own ideas in connection with the form and scope of Federal Government involve(cid:173)ment in the changeover to metric standards. The size of the proposed metric conversion board has been expanded, delays involving development of some kind of comprehensive plan have been embraced by a great many proponents of this legislation, and provisions have been added to require future legislative, as well as executive action in order to imple(cid:173)ment any program whatever. It would be very easy today to lay the entire blame on organized labor for the dis-"

Speaker, I MEMBERS OF TRADE UNIONS SHOULD BE REASONABLE IN NE(cid:173)GOTIATING WAGE INCREASES <Mr. BLACKBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute, to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, it is becoming more and more evident that some members of the construction trades are demanding and receiving some very large wage increases this year. Mr. Speaker, as I recall, the last great surge of inflation in 1970 and 1971, and the thing that finally brought about the imposition of wage and price controls was a similar move in the construction trades industry. Mr. Speaker, I think the country should be reminded that the Members of Con(cid:173)gress, themselves, rejected a wage in(cid:173)crease last year in order to set an ex(cid:173)ample for the rest of the country. Mr. Speaker, unless members of these trade unions wish to force another impo(cid:173)sition of wage and price controls, with the distortions and hardships which in(cid:173)evitably result on our economy, I would urge them to be reasonable in their nego(cid:173)tiations to avoid the creation in our country of those problems that will be brought about by a new imposition of wage and price controls.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the statement be dis(cid:173)pensed with. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. MAHON. Mr. Speaker, it was de(cid:173)termined earlier this year that in light of the energy crisis the Congress would undertake to respond by taking early and decisive action on energy appro(cid:173)priation matters. Instead of having the energy appropriations spread through seven appropriation bills as would have been the normal procedure we would have only one comprehensive energy appropriation bill. We would bring them all together in one package and pass the appropriation prior to the beginning of the fiscal year July 1, 1974, in order that the various agencies and the depart(cid:173)ments of Government might proceed as rapidly and efficiently as possible with these energy programs. Also, by providing these appropria(cid:173)tions in a single bill, rather than in seven bills as would otherwise be the case, we could gain an overview of the thrust of the Federal energy research and devel(cid:173)opment effort. The subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations developed this bill, and they have done an excellent job in the conduct of hearings, the review of budget estimates, and the recommenda(cid:173)tion of funding levels. They have had to increase the speed of their hearings and to work nuch harder and longer, on top of an already crowded schedule, in order to have this bill before you at this early date. The seven subcommittees that devel(cid:173)oped this bill are as follows: The Agri(cid:173)culture, Environmental, and Consumer Protection Subcommittee headed by the gentleman from :Mississippi <Mr. WHIT\u00b7 TEN), the ranking minority member be\u00b7 ing the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. ANDREWS); The HUD, Space, Science, and Vet(cid:173)erans Subcommittee, headed by the gen(cid:173)tleman from Massachusetts <Mr. Bo(cid:173)LAND), the ranking minority member on that subcommittee being the gentleman from California (Mr. TALCOTT); The Interior Subcommittee, headed by the gentlewoman from Washington <Mrs. HANSEN), the ranking minority member being the gentleman from Pennsylvania <Mr. McDADE) ; The Public Works, AEC Subcommittee, headed by the gentleman from Tennes(cid:173)see <Mr. EviNS), the ranking minority member being the gentleman from Wis(cid:173)consin (Mr. DAVIS) ; The State, Justice, Commerce, and Judiciary Subcommittee, headed by the gentleman from New York <Mr. RooNEY), the ranking minority member being the gentleman from Michigan <Mr. CEDERBERG) ; The Transportation Subcommittee, headed by the gentleman from Califor(cid:173)nia <Mr. McFALL), the ranking minority member being the gentleman from Mas-sachusetts <Mr. CONTE); and The Treasury, Postal Service and Gen(cid:173)eral Government Subcommittee, headed ",

Mr. President, I have read with grave concern recent news reports from the Soviet Union that security police have arrested at least 50 Soviet Jews in preparation for President Nixon's visit. The Soviet leaders apparently believe that by making these arrests and in(cid:173)creasing their harassment of individuals they will be able to prevent demonstra(cid:173)tions and appeals to the President by their Jewish citizens who want to emi(cid:173)grate. In\u00b7 addition, security police have arrested and harassed several Jewish scientists, who have been planning a \"scientific seminar\" scheduled to be held in Moscow with foreign scientists, includ(cid:173)ing several Nobel Prize winners, begin(cid:173)ning July 1. The purpose of the \"seminar\" is to help Soviet scientists, who have been fired from their jobs because they applied to emigrate, remain current with scien(cid:173)tific knowledge. The Soviet leaders have made a serious miscalculation. They may succeed in pre-. venting President Nixon and members of his party from seeing any demonstra(cid:173)tions, but, in doing so, they have drawn world attention to the desperate plight of Soviet Jews. They have also cast a shadow over the President's visit. The recent arrests and harassment of Soviet Jews have only intensified the commitment of the American people to help those tens of thousands of human beings who ask only the right to emi(cid:173)grate to the country of their choice-a fundamental human right affirmed more than 25 years ago by the United Nations in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. President Nixon in regrettable remarks at Annapolis may have encour(cid:173)aged Soviet leaders to conclude that the plight of Soviet Jewry is not a concern of the United States. If so, they are wrong. The Soviet leaders should not forget that the Congress has before it both the Stevenson-Jackson amendment to the Export-Import Bank Act and the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Reform Act, and that events in the Soviet Union will have a significant im(cid:173)pact on how the Congress deals with both of these provisions. On the eve of his trip to the Soviet Union, I urge the President to intercede on behalf of those Soviet Jews who have been arrested and harassed in anticipa(cid:173)tion of his visit, and to protest these activities to Soviet leaders. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con(cid:173)sent that the article in today's Washing(cid:173)ton Post by Robert Kaiser, which de(cid:173)scribes in detail the recent arrests and harassment of Soviet Jews, be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Washington Post, June 24, 1974] SOVIET JEWS HARASSED BEFORE VISIT (By Robert G. Kaiser) Moscow, .rune 23.-Most Soviet citizens wUl not be personally affected by this week's Soviet-American summit talks here, but for one small group the visit has already prompted a widespread harassment cam(cid:173)paign. They are the Jewish dissidents who want to emigrate to Israel. According to Jewish sources here, the Jew(cid:173)ish Section of the KGB, or security police, has already arrested at least 50 Jews in various parts of the Soviet Union, all in connection with President Nixon's visit. In some cases the security police have made their arrests quietly. In others they have tracked down Jews in country retreats where they had gone in hopes of avoiding arrest. Some arrests-such as that of engineer Vladimir Slepak-have been violent. The police broke down two doors in Slepak's apartment before taking him away Thurs(cid:173)day morning, according to his son. Slepak had spent 15 days in jail at the time of President Nixon's last visit here in 1972. In Moscow, some prominent \"refusedniks\" (the name those who have been refused permission to emigrate call themselves) are being trailed around town, some by as many a.s four KGB men. The police apparently want to head off any demonstrations by Jewish activists during the Nixon visit, or any other u.nseemingly event. They appear especially concerned \u00b7 about a. scientific \"seminar\" that several Jewish scientists wanted to hold here with distinguished foreign scholars beginning July 1. There have been instances in the past when Jewish activists staged demonstrations to attract the interest of famous visitors which may help explain the police attitude now. The KGB also seems to be upholding an old Russian tradition-far older than the Communist government-by taking preven(cid:173)tive action to avoid disruptions of important events. \"When my father was a. young student in Petersburg before the revolution,\" one of toda.y's Jewish activists recalled recently, \"the Czarist police used to pick them up, with the other Jewish boys, right before Easter. 'We don't want you ruining our Easter,' the pollee warned them.\" Warnings play a. big part in the current crackdown. Several activists-Alexander Voronel, for instance-have been arrested in the morning, lectured all day and released in the evening. Voronel is one of the scientists who was trying to organize the scientific seminar with foreign scholars, including several Nobel Prize winners. The Soviets are hoping to pre(cid:173)vent the meeting from taking place by not issuing visas to the foreigners who have ex(cid:173)pressed interest in the idea, and by arresting or otherwise dissuading the Soviet Jews who planned to take part. The original idea of the seminar was to help scientists who have been fired from their jobs because they applied to emigrate. It would give them an opportunity to present serious papers and meet with competent col(cid:173)leagues. The police have threatened some jews with prosecution for treason if they take part in the seminar, according to Jewish sources. When making these threats, the police re(cid:173)portedly said that treason was possible since the seminar was conceived by enemies of the country. The scientists involved in the seminar, like virtually all the Jews being harassed a.t the moment, have been waiting for months or years for permission to emigrate to Israel. They are among the small but substantial group that the Soviet authorities refuse to let go. One of them is Vitali Rubin, a. scholar whose specialty is Chinese philosophy of the fifth to third centuries B.C. though Soviet officials have repeatedly told American poli(cid:173)ticians and diplomats that only those Jews who had access to state secrets are refused permission to emigrate, Rubin has been wait(cid:173)ing more than two years for an exit visa.. Gen. Shukayev, a. top-ranking official of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, told Rubin's wife, Ina, last week that Rubin's colleagues said his knowledge was unique and could be valuable to the state. His knowledge of Con(cid:173)fucius, the general said might be used for hostile purposes if he left the country. \"It's ridiculous,\" Rubin said in a.n inter(cid:173)view. \"In America there are 20 scholars who know as much as I do about Confucius.\" Rubin and his wife are being followed by four plain-clothesmen. \"Saturday they came to the synagogue with us,\" he said. But other Jews waiting for exit vias, in(cid:173)cluding some prominent ones, are being left alone by the police. It appears that the KGB is mainly concerned with organizers of the seminar a.nd Jews who had earlier staged public protest demonstrations (al(cid:173)though Rubin is in neither category). The refusedniks who have not been appre(cid:173)hended appear to be maintaining their nor(cid:173)mal channels of communication~although the authorities have cut off the telephones of almost every one of them, apparently to prevent conversations with Jewish groups abroad. These Jews listen avidly to foreign radio broadcasts, hoping to hear that news of their arrests and protests is reaching the West, and their own countrymen through Russian(cid:173)language radios from abroad. Several Moscow Jews complained bitterly that the Voice of America pays the least attention to their problems of all the Western radio stations broadcasting to the Soviet Union. \"They are helping their govern(cid:173)ment, and therefore helping our govern(cid:173)ment, too,'' one Jew said of VOA. This activist was partciularly angry about what he felt was a. VOA distortion of a letter released last week by 80 Jews, asking President Nixon not to \"help your partners in the Moscow talks to make our difficult situation here an unbearable one,\" and criticizing the President for failing to help them in the past. This Jew thought the VOA make the letter sound like a request to Nixon not to discuss the Soviet Jews' plight at all. Although most of the refusedniks seem to maintain good spirits, they sometimes waver. Some are afraid of the police. One told the story of Sanya. Lipavsky, a Jewi!h doctor, who parked his car in front of a Jew's apartment house that was being carefully watched by plainclothesmen. When Lipa.vsky left he drove onto a. main Moscow thoroughfare, where his brakes sud(cid:173)denly failed. According to his friends he narrowly averted a serious accident. Later, he discovered that his brake fluid lines had been deliberately cut with pliers. THffiD U.N. CONFERENCE ON THE LAW OF THE SEAS Mr. PELL.

Thus, failure to eventually reach some permanent agreements on offensive weapons could 1n effect reopen the arms race full(cid:173)scale, including defensive missile systems. (The Washington Post reported on Sat(cid:173)urday that an American mission of experts has been sent, unannounced, to the Soviet Union to prepare for a potential limited ban on underground nuclear test firings that could be signed at the Moscow summit con(cid:173)ference. (U.S. officials said that the delegation, now in Moscow, would participate in \"exploratory technical talks\" on what is known as a par(cid:173)tial, or \"threshold\" underground test ban. If no new SALT agreement is reached in time for the Moscow summit meeting, or if there is only a generalized accord in principle on SALT II, the \"threshold\" test ban could serve as the central nuclear weapons accomplish(cid:173)ment at the summit, even though its effect on the nuclear arms race would be limited.) The numerical edge granted the Soviets under the 1972 agreements, was viewed as a. temporary offset to the greater accuracy or. American missiles, the overseas bases for U.S. submarines, and the fact that the U.S. was far ahead in the MIRV technology of put(cid:173)ting several warheads on a single missile and guiding each to a separate target. MIRV stands for multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle, and its develop(cid:173)ment and deployment remain at the heart of the arms race. The United States already has 410 MIRVed Minuteman and 352 Poseidon missiles de(cid:173)ployed out of a planned force of 1,046 MIRVed missiles. The Russian missiles are all of the single(cid:173)warhead variety. But the Soviets are now testing four new replacement misiles with MIRV, and three of them are bigger than existing U.S. mis(cid:173)slles--though not yet as accurate. Thus, con(cid:173)ceivably the U.S.S.R. could outpace the u.s. arsenal in year to come and possibly threaten to knock out all or most of the U.S. Minute(cid:173)man misslles in a surprise attack. Whether the Soviets can achieve the re(cid:173)quired accuracy and reliab11ity to actually pose such a threat is debatable. But the administration is concerned should it even be \"perceived\" that Soviet nuclear forces are more powerful than those of the United States. Because of the indications that the Rus(cid:173)si'a.ns won't settle for less than a. roughly equa.l deployment of Mmv launchers, sources say the levels of an agreement could run close to 1,000 miss1les each. Defense Secretary James R. SchlesingeT has argued thart because the new Soviet re(cid:173)placement missiles are so much biggoo-than U.S. versions, a deal ought to be based heaVi(cid:173)ly on \"throw..;weight\"-which amount of warheads and explosive power a missile can hurl at an opponent--mther than just on number of missiles. The SoViets have ba.lked at this. But the apparent willingness of the Russians to ac(cid:173)cept fewer number of MIRVed misslles than the United Staltes might be a partial ac(cid:173)knowledgement of this argument. Among other concessions the United Sta. tes reportedly is seeking is an increase in the number of allowable U.S. missile-firing sub(cid:173)m.a.rines, and SoViet agreement to llmtt de(cid:173)ployment of their largest new missiles the SS-18. ' If the United Sta. tes can achieve these types of agreements, and keep the overall level of Soviet MIRV deployment below \u00b7that which the United states estimates the So(cid:173)viet Union could deploy over the next five or six years, then some officials at least think such a. pact would \u00b7be justi:fla.ble. Others contend that the overall levels be-~reflects the ing discussed probably amounJt to what the Soviets pl!a.nned to deploy anyway. A MIRV agreement at the 1,000-missile level, could cause some U.S. reductions as well, especially since tbe Navy's new Trident MIRV -firing submarine would join the fleet before \u00b7the end of an extended agreement. This would force retirement of other MIRV missiles rather than the non-MIRVed Po(cid:173)l.a.ris subs as previously planned. The SS-18 is the potential ~replacement for the large SoViet SS-9 missile. It could carry as many as five relatively large MIRVed war(cid:173)heads, according to U.S. estimates, and rthus has long been the weapon of principal con(cid:173)cern if deployed in large numbers. There e.re currently 288 SS-9s and 25 new silos for the SS-18. The missile has been tested roughly 12 to 15 times, sources say, \u00b7but only about six of these reportedly have been with MIRVs. The others ca.rrted single warheads. This hra.s led to some speculation that the SoViet Union may be Willlng to limit deployment of the SS-18 to a single-warhead version. Weapons specialists estimate .that it takes about 20 MIRV flight tests to produce high confidence thwt the system works. There(cid:173)fore, an agreement to restrain a MIRVed SS-18 deployment could probably be monitored by U.S. test-watchers. There is also a probwbility the United States would press to limit the SS-18 deployment to the 25 new silos as replacement for a rela(cid:173)tive number of older SS-9s. Restrictions on the SS-18 would ease some(cid:173)what the threat to Minuteman. But another Soviet missile, the S8-.19, though smaller, also has impressed U.S. specialists. The SS-'19 can carry up \u00b7to six smaller lbut st111 powerful MIRVs. But tMs missile does not yet appear accurate enough 1to knock out silos. 'l'he SS-19, and a similar missile 'known as the SS-17, have both been flight(cid:173)tested almost 20 times now. Experts here \u2022be(cid:173)lieve both will 'be ready for deployment by the end of the year. The SS-18 is expected longer. While the Soviet missile-firing submarine fleet is expanding, sources say the Russians are far behind the United States in developing and deploying sub-launched MI1RV missiles. This explains, they 'believe, why the Soviets have declined to accept U.S. proposals to put limits on the numlber of land-based versus sea-'based ~RIVs. The Soviets, it is e~plained, really have no choice at this point but to deploy their MIRVs on land-based ICBMs. Thus, they re(cid:173)ject efforts to split the total. There is concern that 'the Soviets will use the interim period to solve their subma(cid:173)rine missile problems so as to be in a posi(cid:173)tion to push heavily \u00b7in that area if no permanent agreement is arrived at when the interim laiccord e1q>ires. A new :MiiRV agreement could also raise .problems of verification for the United States. Most officials believe the large SS-18 de(cid:173)ploy;ments could be monitored by U.S. satel(cid:173)lites. Similarly, the new SS-'19---which 1s ex(cid:173)pected to account for the widest deploy(cid:173)ment-uses normal launch methods. This missile's difference from the SS-11 that lt wlll replace is considered by most specialists to be sufficient to permit satell1tes to ac(cid:173)count for necessary silo modifications. The SS-'17, which is also viewed as a re(cid:173)placement for a smaller part of the 1000-mis(cid:173)sile SS-11 foree, could cause some problems since that misstle uses the so-called \"Gold launch\" or \"pop-up\" technique which en(cid:173)ables it to fit more conveniently into the older sUos. This technique pops the missile out of the silo 'before its rocket eniines ignite, saving little st111 to take a room in the silo that normally is needed for exhaust gases to escape. [From the Aviation Week & Space Technology, May 27, 1974] SALT EXTENSION TRADES PoNDERED (By Clarence A. Robinson, Jr.) WASHINGTON .-President Nixon is nearing a decision on proposals by senior advisors to trade key points on nuclear armaments test(cid:173)ing and missile warhead developments .to the Soviets for \u00b7a two-year extension of the pres(cid:173)ent interim strategic arms limitation agree(cid:173)ment (SALT-1). The proposals would tie limits on mul(cid:173)tiple independently targetable reentry ve(cid:173)hicles (MIRVs) to total missile numbers, as the Soviets wish, rather than to \u00b7the throw weight of the missiles, as the U.S. b:as pro(cid:173)posed. They also would establish as part of the SALT undemtandings limitations on war(cid:173)head test explosions based on a concept called thresholding, or limiting warhead size by a measurement of the seismic shock created by underground nuclear testing. This could limit the U.S. to testing war(cid:173)heads smaller than the size believed neces(cid:173)sary to implement new strategic targeting doctrines. The proposals, which Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger is expected to carry to Moscow in advance of President Nixon's planned summit meeting there later this summer, are designed to break the present deadlock in .the Geneva talks. The present SALT agreement expires 1n May, 1977, and under the proposal would be extended to May, 1979. A U.S.-USSR \u00b7bilateral agreement on thresholding would come a.t a time when U.S. representatives the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament are meeting in Geneva seeking to conclude a comprehensive test-ban agreement among 26 nations. But these talks have centered on a. threshold test ban that would permit nuclear tests un(cid:173)derground up to a certain magnitude. THROW WEIGHT LIMrr A number of officials in various agencies believe a limit to the number of MIRVs that each side can have ought to be unacceptable to \u00b7the U. S. if 1t is tied to launchers instead of missile throw weight. Kissinger attempted to gain Soviet agreement to a limit by throw weight when offering earlier to extend the interim agreement two years in a Moscow visit (Aw&sT Apr. 15, p. 14). With the current throw weight of the new missiles developed by the Soviets, they could put a large number of reentry vehicles atop a single booster and still have enough yield in each to counter the U. S. anti-ball1stic misslle defense-the Safeguard system de(cid:173)ployed in the Grand Forks, N.D., Minuteman mtsslle field, a Pentagon ofticia.l explained. He added that, in terms of\u00b7 counter force, the USSR would not achieve any signlficant increase because the ICBMs are already suf(cid:173)ficiently large that accuracy development, while important, Will not greatly enhance the abillty to destroy the U. S. deterrent. \"With or without any increased MIRVtng, both sides already have a significant deterrent,\" he said. to ACCURACY DMPROV~G \u00b7 The Soviets wlll soon have enough guid(cid:173)ance accuracy, as evidenced by their latest test of MIRV's in the Pacific, to provide a significant first-strike capability, one Defense Dept. expert said. He added that a limit to the number of launchers with MIRV's could be a key element and could serve to slow the Soviets down in their development effort. Accuracy in targeting ICBMs is important to developing a first strike ca.pabmty, the otH.cial added, and. it is not taking the Soviets nearly as long to achieve it as many U.S. plan(cid:173)ners believed.

The story of any given prisoner is a tale of personal and family tragedy that would constitute a lengthy drama or documentary by itself. Multiply each case by at least one million, and the scope of the problem can be envisaged. Numerical estimates of prisoners are a constant problem. Often, prisoners are not tried, their families are not notified, and the prisoner is virtually buried alive. In other cases, in which trials are held, transcripts are not available. For example, in China th~ whole picture of political imprisonment, be(cid:173)fore, during, and after the Cultural Revolu(cid:173)tion, is virtually unknown to the outside world. The interested reader might, however, consult with profit the recently issued, widely noted Prisoner of Mao, by Bao Ruowang (Jean Pasqualini) and Rudolph Chelminski, a work described by the publisher as \"an eye(cid:173)witness account of China's Forced Labor Camp System, by one of its few survivors (Bao Ruowang] .\"A twelve-page excerpt from this book appeared in the August 28, 1973, issue of th.is magazine. The situation of the political prisoners in post-Allende Chile, so recently in the head(cid:173)lines, also is not easy to determine exactly. The junta has admitted that 3500 deaths oc(cid:173)curred during the 1973 overthrow of the pro(cid:173)Marxist government. Hard figures are not easily come by, but the former Swedish am(cid:173)bassador to Chile has offered these startling figures: 10,000 to 15,000 killed; 30,000 chil(cid:173)dren orphaned; ... and 200,000 people who have lost their jobs for political reasons. Add to this some 8000 refugees, and we are talk(cid:173)ing less of a coup d'etat than of a holocaust! Somewhat more is known, fortunately, about the outlook in that most youthful of the world's nations, Bangladesh. In 1972 the government issued a retroactive omnibus(cid:173)powers decree aimed at citizens thought to have collaborated with the forces of West Pakistan during Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence. Between 40,000 and 50,000 persons were sentenced to jail under the decree; and though Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has declared amnesty for 30,000 of the pris(cid:173)oners, only 12,000 have so far been released. Some hope glimmers also in Turkey, after a three-year military repression that may have detained a total of 15,000 political pris(cid:173)oners. There, a broad amnesty bill affecting 50,000 criminal and political prisoners has been debated for some time and may or may not be passed this year. These political ma(cid:173)neuverings are, of course, cold comfort to po(cid:173)litical prisoners long since caught up in po(cid:173)lice dragnets and thrown into jail. No glancing account of the political-police mind in actior. can convey in its full reach the terror and despair that such regimes in(cid:173)spire. The following sketches of life under seven representative police regimes may, however, prove indicative: GREECE: THE GENERAL'S COUP The assault on Greek democracy since the colonels' coup of 1967 has been widely pub(cid:173)licized. As the cradle of Western democracy, Greece stands out boldly as a military dic(cid:173)tatorship. The official American role in sup(cid:173)porting Greek totalitarianism is a nagging doubt that repeated denials in Washington and Athens fail to quell. Events have dashed whatever naive hopes existed last autumn that the Greek colonels, under George Papadopoulos, were moving slowly toward democracy. The colonels' coup was succeeded in November 1973 by the gen(cid:173)erals' coup. Free speech and free press are not tolerated in Greece today. The \"amnesty\" of August 1973 proved short-lived, with some prisoners released only to be re-imprisoned, along with ne...-,r victims. As a dread symbol of continued repression, the island concentration camp of Yaros in the Cyclades was re-opened last winter and now holds one hundred to two hundred po-litical inmates. The barren, seven-mile(cid:173)square island, or ... which a concrete military prison alternately hakes in the sun or is buffeted by the chill Aegean winds, was closed in 1969 after a Red Cross team had found conditions there intolerable. Yaros became so infamous af.ter the 1967 coup, when 6,000 \"politicals\" were held on the is(cid:173)land, that even military guards are report(cid:173)edly reluctant to serve there. The main rationale for renewed repres(cid:173)sion was the \"uprising\" of students at Athens Polytechnic College last November. However, it was clear, as tanks roamed the streets, that the students were unarmed. Officials say that thirteen demonstrators were killed, but opponents of the regime believe the num(cid:173)ber was greater. The Greek situation is one of clear-cut political repression, for the re(cid:173)sistance to the Greek militarists has been almost totally ideological. Systematic torture of Greek political pris(cid:173)oners has been well documented. During the brief 1973 thaw, an amnesty released 330 politicals. After the general's coup, the num(cid:173)ber of prisoners rose to at least two hundred, including twenty who were denied freedom last August. Many of those recently jailed have been students rounded up in November in Athens. A crackdown on Salonika students netted another twenty. In February, the Communists were the target, and thirty-five were jailed in one swoop. Now held on Yaros is George Mavros, the liberal leader, and a former aide of Papadopoulos, who now, out of power, may be struck by the irony of this outcome. CZECHOSLOVAKIA: \"NORMALIZATION\" It is not mere rhetoric to suggest that when the Warsaw Pact tanks \u00b7 rolled into Czechoslovakia in August 1968-putting a harsh end to the \"Prague Spring,\" which had sought to give communism a human face(cid:173)the country's entire population of 14 million became political prisoners. Certainly, the \"normalization\" that has taken place since then has amounted to the systematic suppression of a vigorous na(cid:173)tional culture by means of rampant censor(cid:173)ship, tight control, and punitive action. As many as 150 writers, sociologists, historians, and scientists have been directly affected. (At one point, eight Moravian actors were jailed for parodying a Soviet play.) But these intel(cid:173)lectuals do not have to be jailed to be si(cid:173)lenced. By being dropped from the Writers' Union or from university posts and by being reduced to menial work, these potential cul(cid:173)tural leaders are as effectively neutered as if they had been jailed. Gustav Husak, who took over as Czech Communist party leader from Alexander Dub~ek, himself had served eight years in jail in the Fifties. Husak repeatedly said there would be no punitive trials of Dub~ek supporters. Nevertheless, nine political trials were held in Prague and Brno in 1972. Of forty-six persons sentenced for various crimes against the State, only fifteen received sus(cid:173)pended sentences. Amnesty International estimates that there may be three hundred political prisoners. Some emigre leaders, with understandable bias if not documentation, put the number at one thousand. Czech officials are not vol(cid:173)unteering how many politicals are languish(cid:173)ing in the prisons of Bory, Ostrava Opava, Mirov, or Ruzyne. As one Czech told me recently, the only consolation is \"whatever the figure, it is only about 10 percent of what it was in the Fifties.\" The trials of 1972 were considerably more benign than those of the Fifties because of widespread nostalgia for the Dubcek period and disdain for c;ontinuing Soviet presence on Czech soil. The charges mostly concerned the illegal leaflet campaign during the elec(cid:173)tions of November 1971. The subversive leaf(cid:173)lets encouraged people to exercise their con(cid:173)stitutional right to strike names from the Litomeri~e. single list of candidates. Hard-liners wanted sentences of up to fifteen years but \"mod(cid:173)eration\" prevailed, with several defendants getting six-and-one-half-year sentences. A notable victim of the post-Dubcek re(cid:173)pression was a non-Communist journalist, Vladimir Skutina, who was a well-known TV personality during the \"Prague Spring.\" Skutina was arrested in 1969, and again in 1971, on charges of slandering Husak and attacking the Czech-Soviet alliance. Released in April, Skutina is critically ill with a pan(cid:173)creatic infection and a blood clot, and he has suffered a nervous breakdown. At one point he was hospitalized, and his weight dropped to 130 pounds. Skutina's wife was not al(cid:173)lowed to see him for at least nine months during his illness. BRAZIL: \"ORDER AND PROGRESS\" The ten-year-old military government that seized power from the reformer Joao Goulart files the banner of \"Order and Progress\" and amazes the world with its story of Brazil's \"economic miracle.'' Order and progress have been achieved by Draconian methods. The benefits of the country's rapid development go to the few, while poverty proliferates. The repression, jailing, torture, and censorship spew blood and dishonor on whatever gains have been achieved for Brazil's 100 million people. The last fixed estimate of political prison(cid:173)ers, in 1972, was 12,000, but currently it may be anywhere from 500 to 5000. Reuters esti(cid:173)mates the number of victims killed by Brazil's notorious death squads at 1300. At least 210 political prisoners and suspects are known to have died in police custody, most(cid:173)ly under mysterious circumstances. The docu(cid:173)mentation of torture and censorship can only evoke memories of the Nazis. The army has long played a crucial role in Brazilian history, helping to end slavery in 1888 and to depose Emperor Pedro II the following year. But the tight military control that began in 1964 and was further intensi(cid:173)fied in late 1968 is without parallel in the country's history. Countering the repression has been one major force, the Roman Catho(cid:173)lic church, which is increasingly at odds with the regime, and a broad range of other oppo(cid:173)sitionists of varying political hues. In a horrifying document, \"Report on Al(cid:173)legations of Torture in Brazil,\" Amnesty In(cid:173)ternational detailed the findings of a 1972 inquiry. Names of 1081 reported victims and their 472 torturers are listed. Eyewitness ac(cid:173)counts are given. Details of physical, psycho(cid:173)logical, and electronic torture are stated. Brazilian authorities replied by banning from the press all Amnesty International statements on Brazil. (Index magazine, pub(cid:173)lished by Writers and Schol8irs International, has also documented the staggering facts of censorship and press control in Brazil.) Political prisoners in Brazil are mainly trade unionists, peasant leaders, university staff and students, journalists, progressive clergy, and politioians or military men who had supported the democratic regime, which was overthrown in 1964. It has been charged that the cle,rgy, after radical students, have been the major target of oppression and tor(cid:173)ture. Priests have been expelled or refused re-entry after foreign trips. others have been jailed. Some Catholic publications and radio stations have been closed down. An inspirational symbol of church resist(cid:173)ance to the regime is Dom Helder Camara, archbishop of Olinda and Recife, several times a Nobel Prize nominee. The Archiblshop. is not permitted to speak publicly, and the press cannot report his activities. An asBif.st(cid:173)ant of his was killed, apparently by righte:st vigilantes, in 1969. Last year a number of lay workers associated with Dom Helder were jailed and tortured.

            "304": "21006 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE June 25, 197;, too, and this debate will make our task apparent later on this afternoon, I will say to my friend, the gentleman from Iowa, when we present the White House budgetary items in the Treasury, Post Office, and general Government appro(cid:173)priation bill, either easier or more diffi(cid:173)cult, as the case may be. But, in any event, in response to the question asked a moment ago by the gentleman from California <Mr. KETCHUM) , as we know everything is relative. I suggest he look at the le~isla\u00adtive appropriation bill this House passed, on April 4 of this year, and he will find these details on page 8 of the report, where he will see a compilation of the sal(cid:173)aries and expenses we allowed just for the various officers of this House including the Clerk, the Sergeant at Arms, the Doorkeeper, the Postmaster, the Chap(cid:173)lain, the Parliamentarian, the Reporters, the Democratic Steering Committee and Republic conference, and so on. This is an appropriation item already voted on(cid:173)which is over and above what we allow ourselves for our own individual office staif and allowances-and for these of our own purposes, we voted $16.5 million, which is about $200,000 over and above what the President, with all his problems and needs, is asking for the whole White House office staif operation in fiscal year 1975. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. HARRINGTON. Mr. Chairman, I support passage of H.R. 14715, a bill to authorize and limit employment of White House personnel. In one sense, I am reluctant to approve any authorization for the White House staif. I cannot help but wonder if I will be paying the salary of yet another Egil Krogh, John Dean, John Erlichman, Bob Haldeman, and even Tony Ulasciwitz, none of whom in my opinion were among the greatest public officials ever to serve this country. Nevertheless, I am aware that in deal(cid:173)ing with the abuses of the Nixon admin(cid:173)istration, Congress must not place undue restrictions on the office of the\u00b7 Presi(cid:173)dency and future Presidents. Clearly, the President needs competent staif to help him perform his duties. However, H.R. 14715 places needed limitations for the first time on the growth of the Presi(cid:173)dent's office that began almost from its inception and which has accelerattd out of control in the Nixon administration. Under the Nixon administration, the growth of the Executive office of the President has increased almost 400 per(cid:173)cent over the last part of the Johnson administration. While there is nothing inherently wrong with the concept of growth in it(cid:173)self, when in the wrong place and at the wrong rate, uncontrolled growth must be controlled. For at least two reasons the growth of the Executive office must be halted. First, because of President Nixon's highly original but constitu(cid:173)tionally questionable doctrine of execu(cid:173)tive privilege extending over the entire executive staif, each new executive posi(cid:173)tion results in one more policymaking individual refusing any accountability to CollfJress or to the public at large. This extension of secrecy in Government must be stopped today in order that it may be reversed tomorrow. Second, the expan(cid:173)sion of the Executive office staif has led to needless duplication of efforts with the existing Government agencies. H.R. 14715 is not going to end secrecy in the Nixon administration or eliminate duplication between the Executive office and the executive agencies. However, it is a step in the right direction. Through the bill, Congress for the first time au(cid:173)thorizes employment of White House personnel rather than simply leaving White House staffing questions to the appropriation process. In addition, the bill will limit the number of professionals who can work in the White House office. The bill also stops the President from hiding top level executives in ungraded positions not subject to normal Civil Service controls. While the President has long had the authority to hire ungraded employees to enable the hiring of spe(cid:173)cialists, such as groundskeepers and French chefs, not falling within normal civil service classifications, President Nixon has distorted this authority to hire 70 top level officials in ungraded posi(cid:173)tions. Finally, the bill will put a limit on the length of time the White House may detail any single individual from another executive agency to work in the White House. Despite my support for the bill, in many ways I think the bill should go further. While the bill restricts staffing of the White House office, it fails to re(cid:173)strict staffing of the proliferating num(cid:173)ber of councils and miniature bureauc(cid:173)racies within the Executive office of the President. From 1970 to 1972 alone, nine new satellite offices, many of whose func(cid:173)tions previously had been performed by staif assistants, were created in the Ex(cid:173)ecutive office of the President. Some of these offices-such as the Office of Tele(cid:173)communications Policy which apparently attempts to influence the Federal Com(cid:173)munications Commission-seem to have no legitimate function at all. The bill also fails to restrict the num(cid:173)ber of employees who can be detailed from executive agencies to the White House. While the bill does restrict the length of time that such employees may be detailed, it does not restrict the total number of employees who may be so de(cid:173)tailed. Given that in 1971 the Nixon ad(cid:173)ministration acknowledged detailing 273 employees from other agencies to the White House, this is a matter of con(cid:173)siderable concern. In a related matter, the bill does not deal with the problem of what I call \"laundered people.\" The White House must be prevented from placing high level policymakers at the White House on the payrolls of outside executive agencies when these individ(cid:173)uals have never even served a day in the agency from which they are being paid. Another shortcoming of the bill is its failure to take precautions against the possibility of the spending of White House funds for transitional activities after the resignation or impeachment of a President or Vice President. When Vice President Agnew resigned, he remained on the White House payroll sorting out his papers for 6 months. This situation must be prevented from recurring in the future. In fact, while the bill does restrict to some extent the number of staif that the White House can hire, the bill places no restrictions on the type of activities that the White House must fund. Serious con(cid:173)sideration must be given to restricting the White House from using the tax(cid:173)payer's funds for anything other than governmental functions. Certainly, it is questionable as to whether Government funds should be used to defend the Presi(cid:173)dent from his alleged criminal activities. In conclusion, H.R. 14715 is a good bill as far as it goes. But the bill must be kept in perspective as only a begin(cid:173)ning in controlling the expansion of the White House staif; considerably more must be done in the future. Mr. DRINAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment oft'ered by the gentleman from Texas <Mr. PICKLE). Since President Nixon assumed office in 1969, he has carried out an unprece(cid:173)dented expansion of the entire executive branch of Government and the White House Office in particular. The total number of full-time stat! positions in the White House Office more than doubled between 1970 and 1973, rising from 250 to 510. Many of these new positions were created at executive and professional levels. In addition, the President has made increasing use of his blanket au(cid:173)thority to retain experts and consultants to supplement his staif on a temporary basis. Finally, in an effort to circumvent congressional authority to enact person(cid:173)nel appropriations for specific Federal agencies, the President continues to de(cid:173)tail employees of various executive agen(cid:173)cies on to his personal White House staff. At the present time, neither Congress nor the American taxpayer knows exactly who is working for the President and how much they are being paid. Seventy(cid:173)nine full-time members of the White House staff have been exempted from civil service classification by the Presi(cid:173)dent. According to a staif report prepared for the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service under the direction of Con(cid:173)gressman UDALL: The use of the ungraded position is one method for \"hiding\" personnel so that Con(cid:173)gress and the public have no knowledge of what work is being done or by whom. We have all recently borne witness to the tragic consequences of a Presidential stat! which has grown so large that it has lost its sense of accountability to the Congress, the Constitution, and the American people. H.R. 14715, as reported by the committee, places no meaningful restrictions upon the continued expan(cid:173)sion of the White House Office. The Pres(cid:173)ident will have continued authority to hire an unlimited number of outside \"ex(cid:173)perts and consultants\" and to transfer personnel from other executive agencies to his own staff without restraint. The amendment oft'ered by the gen(cid:173)tleman from Texas places reasonable limits on these present sources of abuse. It reduces by 25 the number of high(cid:173)level positions on the White House staff. More importantly, it sets a specific limit on the number of temporary consultants the President can add to his staff and on the nwnber of employees he can transfer from other agencies to the White House staif. I believe that these ",
            "354": "21056 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE June 25, 1974 part of the bargain and all of their municipal sewage projects will be in operation, while many U.S. plants will be still under construc(cid:173)tion. That, one Canadian environmental offi(cid:173)cial says wm be \"like mixing a glass of clean water with a glass of dirty water. You end up with dirty water.\" That dramatic contrast, both Canadian alld U.S. environmental officials agree, illustrates the different ways in which the United States and Canada have followed through on a joint Great Lakes cle.an-up agreement signed with much fanfare by President Nixon and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in April 1972. Under the agreement the two countries committed themselves to having municipal sewage treatment plants for all major cities on the five Great Lakes completed or under way by the end of 1975. And they pledged to cut all Great Lakes pollution, whether from municipal, industrial, agricultural or other sources, in half by 1977. But the U.S., it now appears, badly. lagging is To this, the Christian Science Monitor has added: Right from the outset the Canadians moved aggressively forward on lthe project. By early this year, they had built or modified some 34 treatment fac111ties-including 16 new ones. All told, it is estimated that roughly 75 percent of all Canadian project funds have been met, in some cases with dramatic re(cid:173)sults, as treatment plants have el1m1nated or sharply reduced the flow of pollutants into the lakes. On the U.S. side, meanwhile, the program has been slowed by a wide range of problems, from administrative snafus to red tape to laxness by municipal officials in aggressively going after available federal funds and, ac(cid:173)cording to some Canadian ofHcials, to im(cid:173)poundment by Mr. Nixon of federal water(cid:173)pollution-control funds. The Buffalo Courier-Express, which has been in the forefront of urging a cleanup of the Great Lakes for years(cid:173)and is to be commended by all of us for that leadership, brought this point home to our attention on June 13. That edi(cid:173)torial brought to our attention not only the latest report of the International Joint Commission's Water Quality Board on the failure of the Federal Government to sufficiently honor our commitments, but also on how delays in water-manage(cid:173)ment projects along the Great Lakes con(cid:173)tribute to a worsening of the problem. This excellent editorial follows: IJC's FAMILIAR THEME ON LAKES The latest report from the International Joint Commission's Water Quality Board came down on an old and valid theme: The federal government in Washington is not moving fast enough or with sufficient com(cid:173)mitment to meet the 1975 deadline terms of the Great Lakes cleanup act signed by Pres(cid:173)ident Nixon and Prime Minister Trudeau. We certainly agree (as we have previously) with the IJC's stress on release of funds ap(cid:173)propriated by Congress but which have been partly withheld by the White House. Con(cid:173)gress voted $11-b1llion but President Nixon and his Budget Office have \"impounded\" $6-blllion of that. Although there has been some sign of movement on this general issue(cid:173)Agriculture Secretary Butz recently agreed to \"unfreeze\" $120-mlllion for use oy rural communities on waste and water fac111ties under a program not directly related to the $11-bilUon 1972 clean-waters program ap(cid:173)proved by Congress-it remains entirely un(cid:173)fathomable why the White House continues to balk full implementation of the accord it signed with Canada. Because run-off water (carrying pesticide residues, for one thing) is one of the unre(cid:173)solved problems in the lakes, we also were pleased that the House last week voted a variety of funds for Western New York :flood(cid:173)control and water-management projects, and we hope the Senate wm soon follow. These included $275,000 for work in the Buffalo River drainage area and $135,000 covering planning of the ElUcott Creek diversion channel. Along with Rep. Jack Kemp, R(cid:173)Hamburg, we find it distressing that the state appears to be dragging its feet on its share of the latter project's cost. We've recently noted various reports of gains made in the fight to reverse pollution of Lakes Erie and Ontario and we find that very encouraging, of course. Yet it's a monu(cid:173)mental task. All the lakes have to be con(cid:173)sidered as having a common, interrelated problem requiring treatment on a group(cid:173)therapy basis. When a court permits a firm to continue dumping pollutants into Lake Su(cid:173)perior, for instance, communities along all the other lakes eventually wm be affected to some degree or other. Progress seems to come one small step at a time; we urge our repre(cid:173)sentatives to keep up the good work and the pressure to get all the duly-voted money flowing freely to these badly-needed projects. What these observations boil down to, in my opinion, is showing that there is too much talk on the American side and too little action. Something else has to be done-some(cid:173)thing to specifically provide EPA with separate funding authority-and clear direction and intent on the part of the Congress-to honor these commitments. My bill would do this. If the concern is that a particular treaty obligation to clean up the Great Lakes draws funds away from the rest of the country or the remainder of those areas not emptying into the Great Lakes but yet being in Great Lakes States, then let us maintain the integrity of the gen(cid:173)eral funds and, at the same time, estab(cid:173)lish a new funding source for honoring our international pollution control agree(cid:173)ments-with Canada or any other na(cid:173)tion. My bill would do this. The bill specifically provides that in addition to other funds now being pro(cid:173)vided, the EPA Administrator may make grants from these new funds to any State, municipality, or intermunicipal or interstate agency for the construction of publicly owned treatment works which(cid:173)as determined under regulations pre(cid:173)scribed by the Administrator-are re(cid:173)quired for compliance with any water pollution control agreement between the United States and any other nation. Fed(cid:173)eral participation in these projects(cid:173)since they are constructed in further(cid:173)ance of a Federal treaty obligation(cid:173)would be 100 percent of the costs of con(cid:173)struction. The bill would authorize the level of funds which the Congress has already authorized-but which have not been ex(cid:173)pended-for the past 3 fiscal years-$100 million per fiscal year. The full text of the blll follows: H.R. 15594 Be 1.t enacted. by the Senate ana House of Representatives of the United.

The same attitude which has pervaded this matter to date will most probably characterize the debate on this bill. On April 29-nearly 2 full months ago-I inquired in writing of EPA as to its attitude on the bill which I introduced today and as to the estimated cost of totally honoring our treaty commitment. As of this date, I have not heard word one-written or oral-from EPA on this matter. I cannot help but feel that this is no fault of EPA's, but rather is a problem arising from the administrative policies foisted upon the agency by OMB. I use this opportunity to request of the distinguished chairman of the Commit(cid:173)tee on Public Works, Mr. BLATNIK of Min(cid:173)nesota, that he insist that EPA provide its independent views on this bill and provide the Congress with an accurate estimate of the projected costs of honor(cid:173)ing our treaty obligations. I think the cause of water pollution control on the Great Lakes and through(cid:173)out the Nation would be promoted by holding public hearings on this bill at the earliest possible date. call upon my colleagues-especially those who are members of the Confer(cid:173)ence of Great Lakes Congressmen(cid:173)which is chaired by the chairman of the I ",

KOCH OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, June 25, 1974 Mr. KOCH. Mr. Speaker, I am ap(cid:173)pending material from Prof. Herman Schwartz' article entitled \"A Report on the Costs and Benefits of Electronic Surveillance--1972\" for the information of our colleagues: COST OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE 1969 THE PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT AT(cid:173)TEND THE SOVIET SUMMIT MEE;T(cid:173)ING HON. ANGELO D. RONCALLO 0:' NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, June 25, 1974 Mr. RONCALLO of New York. Mr. Spea.ker, 50 Russian Jews have been arrested, some severely beaten, in antici(cid:173)pation of the President's trip to the U.S.S.R. This trip is not worth the bru(cid:173)talizing it might continue to cause to innocent Russian Jews. It is necessary for each of us to publicly raise our voices in protest at this latest barbaric threat to Soviet Jewry. I have cosponsored a reso(cid:173)lution calling upon President Nixon to intervene on behalf of the 50 arrested Soviet citizens and to forgo the Soviet summit meeting until Russian leaders give their assurance that the President's visit will not be used as an excuse for the persecution of Soviet Jewry. The resolution follows: DRAFT OF RESOLUTION to Whereas we along with all Americans and freedom-loving people throughout the world are outraged over the Soviet Union's arrest in advance of the summit meeting of fifty So(cid:173)viet dissidents involved in the movement to free Soviet Jews, and Whereas many of these persons involved have been severely beaten, harassed, and im(cid:173)prisoned, and Whereas such oppression 1s contrary international moraltty and the sanctity of basic human rights, and Whereas Soviet leaders have consistently stated that political harassment is outside Soviet law, and Whereas no successful detente can be es(cid:173)tablished without assurance of the preserva(cid:173)tion of fundamental human rights which are basic tenets in the American tradition: Therefore be it Resolved, That it is the sense of the Con(cid:173)gress that the President not attend the summit meeting until Soviet leaders provide assurances that this visit wm not be used as an excuse for intensified persecution of these herotc people struggling for basic hu(cid:173)man rights; and be it further Resolved, That it 1s the sense of the Con(cid:173)gress that the President immediately inter-With the arrival of the Nixon administra(cid:173)tion, federal wiretapping and eavesdropping began. It started slowly in 1969, but by 1971 the federal government became the single most extensive eavesdropper. The states did not slack off, however, and as a result 1969 saw a sharp increase in the overall rate of law enforcement surveillance. 1. Federal survelllance. a. Authorizations and installations. The federal government made only 34 ap(cid:173)plications for electronic surveillance au(cid:173)thority, of which 33 were granted and 30 installed. b. Offenses. Authorizations: G, 22; 1 D, 5; 1 H, 0; K, i; 0, 5. Installations: G, 20; D, 4; K, 1; 0, 5. This predominance of gambling-67%(cid:173)with drugs a weak second, has continued and indeed increased, as the summary shows. c. Place. Six of the 30 installations were in New York, and 6 in New Jersey-thus 40% were in just two states, a concentration that is repeated in the state figures. d. People. The Appendix figures indicate that some 4,256 people were overheard, an average of about 147; again the Ad_nin. Off. Rep. is somewhat dlfi'erent, but the differences are not great-an average of 152 and a total of 4,308. What is especially interesting, how(cid:173)ever, are the averages per installation, by offense: G, 101; D, 145; K, N.I.; 0, 332; All, 147. As will appear below, these contrast very sharply with the State averages, which are m.uch lower. e. Conversations. Adding up the conversations reportedly overhead as individually described in the Appendix, we get an overall total of 4:1,929, and an average of 1,446 conversations per in(cid:173)stallation, a few thousand conversations less than the 44,442 total derived from the Admin. Off. Rep. average of 1444.4 for the 30 installations. The breakdown of average number of con(cid:173)versations per installation, by offense, is as follows: . G, 1,512; D, 1,778; K, N.I.; 0, 921; All, 1,446. It will be noted that in 1969 more was overheard on drug installations than on gambling. This pattern shifted radically in future years, without any apparent ex(cid:173)planation. f. Duration. Of the 30 installations, some 20 were less than 20 days-generally, the average period 1 The Admin. Off. Rep. summaries show 23 gambling and 4 drug applications. but this seems wrong, according to the individual statistics in the Append~x. June 25, 197 4 of time, including extensions, has been s:Jme 13 days. However, 3 of the gambling bstalla(cid:173)tions, 1 drug and 2 others were from 20 to 29 days, and 3 installations were from 30 to 59 days. 2. State survelllance. a. Authorizations and installations. By December 31, 1969, some nine states had authorized use of wiretapping, thoug!l Massachusetts did not report any usage in 1969; the ether states were Arizona, Colo(cid:173)rado, Florida, Georgh, Maryland. New .Jer(cid:173)sey, New York and Rhode Island. The:e states obtained 269 authorizatiOI!S and made 260 installations; there were 189 ex ten >ions. Here agsin, the Admin. Off. Rep. has a muc':l lower figure for installations: again this is because the Administrative Office improperly considers installations for which there are no reports of conversations and persons overheard, as not installed. b. Offenses. The relative proportions begin slowly to move toward an lncrea!;e in gambling and a corresponding decrease in the re:;t, particu(cid:173)larly drugs. The 1969 individual Appendix figures show the following: Authorizations: G, 79; D, 85; H, 19: K, 1; 0, 85; All, 269. Installations: G, 78; D, 80; H, 19; K, 1; 0, 82; All, 260. c. Place. Again, New York accounts for the bulk of the interceptions, this time with New Jer(cid:173)sey a distant but clear second: 191 orders were granted in New York and 45 in New Jersey. Within New York, a preponderance in some areas appears again. This time, Queens had 51 orders and some 49 installa(cid:173)tions; Brooklyn and the Bronx dropped to 19 and 23 respectively, from the prior year's 68 and 33, even though the time period was twice as long. Elsewhere, Maryland had 15 orders and installations, Arizona had 8 or(cid:173)ders of which at least 5 were installed, Georgia had 5 orders and at least 2 were in(cid:173)stalled, Colorado and Florida each had 2 or(cid:173)ders and 2 and 1 installed, respectively. and Rhode Island had one. d. Persons. There is a very great disparity between the figures computed from the Appendix and those in the Admin. Off. Rep. The 1971 ACLU Report indicated that some 26,876 people were overheard-this is the difference between the average number of people over(cid:173)heard, multiplied by the total number of installations for all 1969 survemances ( 116 X 271 =31,436) less the federal average mul(cid:173)tiplied by the federal total ( 152 X 30 = 4,560) . But adding up the total of the individual reports in the Appendix produces only 8,590 for some 214 installations, or an average of only 40, not the 112 indicated in the Admin. Off. Rep. Even if the 40 1s extrapolated to all 260, the total is still only 10,400. Tbe 40 figure seems the more plausible, since the 1969 figure was only 25 and, as will be seen below, the 1970 and 1971 state figures from the Appendix are 43 and 34 respectively. and from the Admin. Office, 39 and 33 respec(cid:173)tively. For this reason, the overall average for all installations is not likely to have been I 12, as the Admin. Off. Rep. indicates, but about 50. As a result, the original 1969 state figure in the ACLU report was over(cid:173)stated bv A.bout 16,000. The breakdown of averages of people over-heard per installation by offense is as follows: G, 48; D, 27; H, 16; K, 19; 0, 54. e. Conversations. Here, the Appendix and Admin. Off. figures are close. The Appendix figures show 1213.452 conversations in 228 installations, or an aver(cid:173)age of 555 per installation, broken down by offense as follows: G, 525; D, 405; H, 1,100; K, 21; 0, 615: All, 555. Extrapolating this 550 average to the 260 installations, one arrives at 144,300, or about ",
            "454": "21156 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE June 26, 197 4 Shuman and Rosenau rightly insist, \"It re(cid:173)flects not only major economic trends . . . but all facets of national life-from prosper(cid:173)ity to social unrest to involvement in for(cid:173)-eign affairs\"-producing major sociological .and political changes, including in the phase of downturn \"a strong shift to political con(cid:173)servation.\" Finally, if we accept the Kondratieff .cycle, it conveys the frightening warning that we are only at the beginning of the \"lean years\" and that we must suppose that things will get worse before they get better. To that ex(cid:173)tent the parallels often drawn between 1971 and 1931 are misleading, and so is the con(cid:173)clusion that as things did not turn out as bad when the dollar went off gold as they did when the pound went off gold in 1931, we are out of the wood. On the contrary, the parallel, if there is one, of 1971 is with 1921, when the boom which began in 1896 ran out, and our comparative place in the cycle today is 1924, not 1934. Evidently, there is still time, as governments fiddle and inflation grows, for another Hitler--or worse. The necessary starting point for any con(cid:173)sideration of the present-day economic crisis is the Depression of 1929, not because of any facile comparisons we may be tempted to draw, but because it was the catalyst of the world in which we live. By 1933, when Roose(cid:173)velt succeeded Hoover, it appeared that the capitalist system was on its last legs, and the purpose of the New Deal-no different from the purpose of John Maynard Keynes(cid:173)was to ensure that it did not totter to its fall. The experience of the Depression colored the mental outlook of a whole generation. No one who stood in the breadline was likely to forget it; but neither were the business(cid:173)men, corporation lawyers, and Wall Street financiers who thronged into the Roosevelt Administration. For them, also, it was a traumatic experience. As revisionist historians, such as Williams and Kolka, and Lloyd Gardner in particular, have shown, the international policies of the New Deal were conditioned by the Depression, not only before but during the war years.7 Dean Acheson's statement in November, 1944, to the Congressional Committee on Postwar Economic Policy has been much quoted, but is worth recalllng because it epitomizes so much of American thinking. \"We cannot,\" he said, \"go through another ten years like the ten years at the end of the Twenties and the beginning of the Thirties without having the most far-reaching consequences upon our economic and social system.\" Six years later Truman drove home the same lesson even more directly: \"In 1932, the private enterprise system was close to collapse. There was real danger that the American people might turn to some other system. If we are to win the struggle between freedom and communism. we must be sure that we never let such a depression happen again.\" What such a depression signified in eco(cid:173)nomic terms and the stages by which it de(cid:173)veloped-beginning with the recession in agriculture and primary commodities many months before the Wall Street crash in Octo(cid:173)ber, 1929, signaled the general collapse-we can now see, with a minimum of dogmatism and a maximum of cool factual informa(cid:173)tion, thanks to C. P. Kindleberger. Kindle(cid:173)berger's book is a major achievement. Per(cid:173)haps because its impact was so overwhelm(cid:173)ing, its scale so vast, there has been so far(cid:173)as a.ny teacher searching for an appropriate book for his reading list can testify-no really satisfaGtory history of the Great De(cid:173)pression. Kindleberger fills the gap. His views of the origins of the Depression are franklv eclectic, and he is deliberately cautious about the sort of one-track remedies which are being so freely canvassed today. Even \"with perfect monetary policy,\" he insists, Footnotes at end of article. \"even with anticyclical capital movements, there would have been a depression.\" Sym(cid:173)metry \"may obtain in the scholar's study,\" but \"is hard to find in the real world.\" Kin(cid:173)dleberger's concern is with the real world, or at least with that part of the real world where administrator.;;, Treasury officials, bankers, and the politicians operate. The story Kindleberger unfolds is of a chain reaction which, granting the initial conditions and built-in predispositions of the actors, it was beyond human capacity to halt; and the attentive reader cannot fail to be struck by the number of disturbing parallel'.;; with today. Reading through Kin(cid:173)dleberger I quickly noted no fewer than fif(cid:173)teen points of similarity. Obviously I cannot list, still less discuss, them all. But who, for example, can fall to be impressed by the sim(cid:173)ilarity between Roosevelt's \"America First\" policy when he took the dollar off gold in in 1933 and Nixon's economic nationalism when he took the dollar off gold in 1971? \"This,\" said Lewis Douglas in the first instance, \"is the end of Western civiliza(cid:173)tion\"; Nixon's policy of \"benign neglect,\" Arthur Burns is reported by Henry Brandon to have said, amounted to \"murdering the international monetary system without pro(cid:173)posing to put anything else in its place.\" True, it was followed by the Smithsonian agreement of December 18, 1971, a parallel in its way to the Tripartite Monetary Agree(cid:173)ment of 1936, and the world of international finance heaved a sigh of relief. But where today is the Smithsonian agreement, with its elaborate devices of \"snakes\" and \"crawling pegs,\" to replace the link between the dollar and gold? \"Dead,\" is Tobin's succinct answer. By the time Rolfe and Burtle wrote, in 1973, there were five major currencies float(cid:173)ing independently, and this floating was ac(cid:173)companied by \"a plethora of short-term cap(cid:173)ital controls\" and trade enactments. We do not yet have, quite, the \"headlong stampede to protection and restrictions,\" to the \"beg(cid:173)gar-thy-neighbor tactics in trade and ex(cid:173)change depreciation,\" that Kindleberger describes as characteristic of the 1930s. But for how much longer? Rolfe and Burtle take heart from the fact that the \"horror sce(cid:173)narios\" of\u00b7 \"trade war . . . tariffs and coun(cid:173)tertariffs and a return to the competitive devaluations of the 1930s\" have not \"come to pass.\" The point is that we are not yet at that stage in the cycle. There is plenty of food for thought in Kindleberger's book. In particular, there is food for thought in his conclusion that \"the main lesson of the inter-war years\" is \"that for the world economy to be stabilized, there has to be a stabilizer.\" Before 1931 it was the United Kingdom; after 1945 it was the United States. Today there is none. Mrs. Camps' conclusion Interdependence is that \"the United States, Western Europe, and Japan will in effect share leadership,\" but none wm \"fully ac(cid:173)cept the obligations of that role\" and none \"will be prepared to see any of the others gain the perquisites that go with the obliga(cid:173)tions.\" A discouraging prospect. The alternative, according to Kindleberger, is \"international institutions with real au(cid:173)thority and sovereignty,\" and this I find more discouraging still, in a world in which, as Mrs. Camps puts it, \"the dominant char(cid:173)acteristics\" are \"an increasing concern with domestic problem.s, a more strident em(cid:173)pha.sis on national interest, and a decline in the prestige of international organizations.\" In the 1930S also, \"proposals for embryonic international monetary funds were legion. .... They were uniformly turned down.\" Those who, like Rolfe and Burtle, pin their hope on Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) as the \"base for a future monetary system with(cid:173)out economic warfare\" please take note. Kindleberger's book, for all its merits, does not quite live up to the promise of its title. Its subject is not \"the world in depression.\" in The Management of but, as he himself correctly says, \"the world economy in depression.\" The difference is important. Apart from the usual obligatory references to Hitler, and a passing remark about its effect in stimulating \"fifty revolu(cid:173)tions in Latin America,\" there is little in Kindleberger's book to bring home to the reader the shattering political consequences of the Depression or its global impact.s His a ttl tude is rather like that of a general on a battlefield, unmoved by the carnage and destruction, thinking only of tactics and strategy. It would be a pity if this rather severely technical approach obscured the fact that the Depression was not just an un(cid:173)fortunate economic relapse, but also the solvent of the entire, admittedly fragile, existing international order. It was scarcely an accident of history that the Japanese in(cid:173)vasion of Manchuria, the first major break in the international structure established after 1918, occurred in 1931. Historians too often write as though Hitler, or Saito and Konoye, or Mussolini overthrew the existing status quo. In reality, they sim(cid:173)ply exploited the dislocation the Depression had created. And this also is not without modern connotations. If in 1930 the inter(cid:173)national order re-established after the First World War collapsed under the impact of the slump, by 1970 the new international order created by the United States after 1945 was visibly creaking at the joints. Already in the summer of 1968 one commentator announced that \"money pressure\" was \"forcing detente all over the world.\" 9 With the advent of Nixon the prediction was simply confirmed. The Guam doctrine, announced on July 25, 1969, and the Kissin(cid:173)ger-Nixon visits to Peking and Moscow that followed, may not, as Rolfe and Burtle insist, have meant a \"retreat of American power,\" but they certainly indicated a major shift in world forces, and no one would deny that \"money pressure\"-in other words, a radical change in the economic climate, a downward swing in the Kondratieff cycle-was an opera(cid:173)tive factor. As Henry Brandon puts it, \"Short(cid:173)age of money became one of the most potent American policy makers, just as its abund(cid:173)ance had been a generation earlier.\" The broader effects of the Depression in the advanced industrial countries are too well known to need description; but their impact on existing ideologies was no less shattering. Above all, they drove home the lesson that unemployment on the scale of the 1930s must never be allowed to occur again. The classic remedy of massive deflation was out, and the maintenance of full employment became the central pillar of postwar economic policy, both domestic and international. This preoccupation with full employment was due to the \"gnawing fear\" (as The New York Times put it in 1946) that, once the postwar boom was over, \"the United States might run into something even graver than the Depression of the Thirties,\" with all its incalculable social and political possiblll(cid:173)ties.1o Internationally, it translated into a fear \u2022'whether the American capitalist sys(cid:173)tem could continue to function if most of Europe and Asia should abolish free enter(cid:173)prise,\" a determination \"to increase our outlets abroad for manufactured products,\" and an opposition to high tariffs, exclusive trading blocs, and unfair economic compe(cid:173)tition, which-as Cordell Hull, never tired of insisting-bred the war which broke out in the Far East in 1937, spread to Europe in 1939, and engulfed the United States in 1941. Considering the small part that foreign trade played (and stm plays) in the United States economy, this obsession with foreign markets is easier to explain on psychological than on rational grounds; but Dean Acheson was certainly expressing a prevalent view when he said: You don't have a problem of production. The United States has unlimited creative ",

I do not think the time spent in this debate will be wasted, but I do think it is very important that we pass this bill now-at least within the next 48 hours. Mr. President, if this Nation were pre(cid:173)vented, in effect, by the laws of Congress from paying its just debts to its own citizens and to some nations abroad, this Nation would be put in an indefensible position before the entire world. How would it look for this, the richest Nation on the face of the earth, to re(cid:173)fuse to pay its honest debts because an act of Congress says it can pay no more? Here we are, the richest nation on the face of the earth, and we would, in effect, declare ourselves bankrupt and unable to pay our bills and our debts. Everybody knows our credit is good; it is just that we insist on coming up to the point of saying we are broke and cannot pay our bills and will not honor our debt obligations .. How would it look to our own Govern(cid:173)ment employees, the man that gets out and carries the mail in the hot sun, or any Government worker, a private in the Army or a white collar worker daily reporting on time to do his duty in any Government office, when he cannot be paid because the Congress, in effect, has passed an act to say that we are official(cid:173)ly bankrupt and we refuse to pay our honest obligations? That would be ridic(cid:173)ulous and it would make us look foolish and silly before the world. We have had some very fine men par(cid:173)ticipating in the debate on the bill, one of whom I had the privilege of voting for to be the President of the United States and some of wl:om I will probably have the opportunity to vote for to be Presi(cid:173)dent of the United States in the future. None of those men, whether they be candidates for the highest office in the land or candidates for the Senate, would want this Nation to appear to be ridicu(cid:173)lous and irresponsible before the whole world, friends and enemies alike. I think, Mr. President, that the respon(cid:173)sible thing for us to do now is to agree to this motion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen(cid:173)ator from Alabama. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from Louisi(cid:173)ana, the chairman of the Finance Com(cid:173)mittee, for the motion that he has made, that the pending bill (H.R. 14832) be recommitted to the Finance Committee with instructions forthwith to return the bill to the Senate shorn of the pending amendment. That then would bring back a clean, unamended bill, just exactly as it came to us from the House of Rep(cid:173)resentatives. Mr. President, that is what the Sena(cid:173)tor !rom Alabama has been seeking for the last 8 or 10 days, and this conclu(cid:173)sion would have been available to the Senate and to the proponents of this package at any time. The Senator from Alabama is a strong supporter of tax reduction and tax re(cid:173)form, at the proper time and using the proper vehicle. He does not believe that the time to reduce taxes is at a time when the in(cid:173)flation rate in this country is running somewhere around 13 percent, and he feels that a reduction at this time would only add to the fires of inflation and that it would not be in the public in(cid:173)terest. The very people that the tax package of the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Massachusetts presented to the Senate would, in the judgment of the Senator from Alabama, actually cost the people that it sought to help more than it saved them. So the tax package would not have been in the interest of the taxpayers. Further, the so-called tax reform and tax reduction offered mighty little tax reduction to the average citizen. The bill before us at the present time pro(cid:173)vides for increasing the personal exemp(cid:173)tion from $750 to $800. One of the first pieces of legislation the Senator from Alabama ever intro(cid:173)duced in the Senate was in the year he came to the Senate when the Tax Re(cid:173)form Act of 1969 was under discussion in the Senate. He introduced an amend(cid:173)ment setting the personal exemption at $1,200. At that time it was $600. The $1,200 amendment did not pass, but the Gore amendment did pass, which raised the exemption from the $600 by degrees up to the $750. There is just a little arithmetic on really the wisdom of this tax package, this so-called tax reduction. With the $800 personal exemption, a person in the 70-percent tax bracket would have a saving of 70 percent of that amount for each of his exemptions, which would be $560; whereas the person in the 25-percent tax bracket would have received a tax reduction per exemption of only $200. It would favor or continue to favor the person of large means and large in(cid:173)come. So it does not seem actually that this is a great measure for the taxpayer. The Senator from Alabama has felt all along that this 12-line bill having to do with the debt ceiling and extending the authorization for a temporary debt from the last day of this month or the 1st of July on through March 31 and raising it by $95 billion, that should not be amended here on the Senate floor with these pending amendments, about a pound and a half of amendments, and that is what would have happened the floodgates had been opened to the consideration of all of these amend(cid:173)ments. It is in the public interest that the debt ceiling bill pass as it came to us from the House. The House passed this bill by only a one-vote margin, and if we had to send it back to the House there is no doubt about what they would do with it. So, Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama would certainly want to give careful and sympathetic attention to any tax reform measure when it had the benefit of the recommendations of the Committee on Ways and Means in the House, the recommendations of the Committee on Finance in the Senate, and to present a package that was well-bal(cid:173)anced both as to tax reduction and as to replacement of those taxes, But the distinguished Senators who if sponsored this tax package-by the way, the distinguished Senator from Massa(cid:173)chusetts <Mr. KENNEDY) spoke about a minority of the Senate, in effect, thwart(cid:173)ing the will of the majority. Well, the Senator from Alabama re(cid:173)calls the vote up and down on the Ken(cid:173)nedy package was 33 votes for it and 64 against it. So it does not look like any majority was being thwarted there. On the cloture motion earlier today those advocating cloture, with the im(cid:173)mediate vote or certain vote on the amended tax package, could garner only 48 votes against 50 for it Mr. President, I believe that this bill should pass without amendments, and that is the effect of the motion of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, and I certainly support that motion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques(cid:173)tion is on the motion of the Senator from Louisiana to recommit H.R. 14832. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.

            "554": "21256 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE June 26, 197 4 I from New Hampshire (Mr. CLEVELAND), a member of the committee. Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for yielding me this additional time. There is one bit of legislative history that I would like to establish now. I will address the gentleman from New Jersey <Mr. RoE), who, believe, is knowledgeable about this section of the bill. Under section 8 of the bill there is es(cid:173)tablished a title IX. In the committee report on page 6, there is described some of the examples of the structural eco(cid:173)nomic changes which cause the type of major adjustment problems that we hope to attack through the provisions of this new section, for example, the closing of a Federal installation, and so forth. Without in any way diminishing that list, and it is not meant to be an exclu(cid:173)sive list, I would like to refresh the mem(cid:173)ory of the gentleman from New Jersey. During the committee discussion of this particular section of the bill, we did have some discussion about the type of hardship that is caused in some ski resort areas of the country. Situations where you had not only one bad winter, but where they have had long and prolonged periods of bad winters, 2 and 3 years of poor snowfall, for example. We also had statistic~ before the committee as to the large amount of employment that was involved. In my own State, for example, this would be approximately 2,500. So I wanted to establish as a matter of legislative intent and history that under title IX it will be possible for the grant to be made to a State, and the State in turn could take that money and use it as a revolving fund to make emer(cid:173)gency loans to the areas such as ours in the district of the gentleman from New Jersey and my own district; areas that have been visited with long and pro(cid:173)tracted periods of adverse weather con(cid:173)ditions. Would the gentleman from New Jer(cid:173)sey respond to that Mr. ROE. If the gentleman will yield, I will be glad to respond. The gentleman from New Hampshire is talking about title IX, and it is my understanding that the Secretary will have broad powers where there has been such an economic dislocation so as to cause heavy unemployment, or to cause the economy to be in a downward direc(cid:173)tion, that the Secretary has the preroga(cid:173)tive under title IX. The recollection of the gentleman from New Hampshire is correct. The CHAIRMAN. The time of gentleman has expired. Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT. I yield 1 ad(cid:173)ditional minute to the gentleman from New Hampshire. Mr. CLEVELAND. I thank the gentle(cid:173). man for yielding me the additional time. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to be sure that we are referring to the pilot pro(cid:173)grams under Title IX. Mr. ROE. Yes. Mr. CLEVELAND. And under the pilot program a grant could be made to a State, and if the other requirements were met this could be used as a revolv-the ing fund to make loans to ski areas in trouble and of course not just such areas. This is particularly important, because some of the loans made in a State could then be outside of redevelopment areas, it could thus be anywhere in the State. Mr. ROE. That is my 1,mderstanding. I believe the gentleman is correct. Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT. Mr. Chair(cid:173)man, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Delaware <Mr. nu PoNT). Mr. nu PONT. Mr. Chairman, I hope the gentleman from New Hampshire <Mr. CLEVELAND) and the gentleman from New Jersey <Mr. RoE) will listen to what I have to say, because I believe the point that was just under discussion is an im(cid:173)portant one. I, too, have read the paragraph at the top of page 5 of the committee report. Let me just ask the members of the com(cid:173)mittee. Is it really their intention to use the taxpayers' money to subsidize an in(cid:173)dustry because it has not snowed enough to keep that industry going? Am I right on that? Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. nu PONT. I yield to the gentleman from New Hampshire. Mr. CLEVELAND. I thank the gentle(cid:173)man for yielding. That is our intention. I would like to say this is our intention under the work(cid:173)ing capital loan provision. I might say to the gentleman, and I can only speak with authority for my own district, that in my own district this particular type of industry supports more than 2,500 peo(cid:173)ple and is the economic backbone of cer(cid:173)tain areas, and these are the areas that this legislation is specifically designed to help. This is the type of area that 1s sometimes in the southern part of the Appalachian Mountains referred to as Appalachia. It is a way to get jobs and an economic base into that type of an area and on a year-round basis. That is specifically our intent. Mr. nu PONT. Mr. Chairman, I am sorry that we have come to the point of subsidizing people because it is not snowing. Mr. CLEVELAND. Will the gentleman yield further? Mr. nu PONT. No, I will not yield fur(cid:173)ther. Mr. CLEVELAND. It is not a subsidy; it is a loan. Mr. nu PONT. I understand that, but it is still money being paid by the taxpayer. Mr. Chairman, I should like to call to the attention of the Committee the prob(cid:173)lem of the district I represent. As many of my colleagues probably know who go to Rehoboth Beach in the summertime, we have a beautiful area. But we have had 8 straight weeks of rain. The busi(cid:173)ness in Rehoboth Beach is terrible. Snow(cid:173)cone sales are off substantially. Suntan lotion sales are down because there is no sun. The druggists are suffering. There has not been a bikini bathing suit sold in Rehoboth Beach yet this season. The clothing merchants are having trou(cid:173)ble making ends meet. To some extent that is offset by those stores who sell raincoats, because more raincoats are being purchased. Never-theless, if raincoat sales are up, and bikini sales are down, there is a disloca(cid:173)tion in the economy of the area, and there is a shifting pattern of income from one segment of the economy to another. I would say to the gentleman from New Hampshire that 1f it is appropriate for New Hampshire to get relief because it is not snowing enough, it is appropriate for Delaware to get relief because it is not sunny enough. I would ask that it be made part of the legislative history that it is the Commit(cid:173)tee's intent to make Delaware benefit from the same provisions as New Hamp(cid:173)shire does. \u00b7 Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. nu PONT. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. WRIGHT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I think to the extent that the com(cid:173)munity in Delaware would qualify under the meaning of the law as a depressed area, to the extent that the climate con(cid:173)tributes to the downfall of an industry, I might say if the gentleman represents an area where there are no bikinis being worn and everybody is going around in raincoats, that has got to be a depressing area, whether it is depressed or not. Mr. nu PONT. The most depressing area of all is this bill, which pays people with taxpayers dollars because it is not snowing enough. I appreciate the gentle(cid:173)man's confirming that merchants in Re(cid:173)hoboth Beach are going to be eligible for the same kind of loans as ski tow op(cid:173)erators in New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the re(cid:173)mainder of my time. Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, at this point I should like to yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. BURKE). Mrs. BURKE of California. Mr. Chair(cid:173)man, I wish to voice my strong support for the economic development bill we have before us today. This bill extends the current public works and economic development programs for 2 years and authorizes $510 million for each of the next 2 fiscal years. These programs have, since their es(cid:173)tablishment in 1965, contributed greatly to the balanced economic development of areas with high structural unemploy(cid:173)ment and demonstrated need. The Pub(cid:173)lic Works Subcommittee on Economic Development, of which I am a member, has heard testimony this spring from a wide range of witnesses-including Gov(cid:173)ernors, mayors, Federal, State and local officials, and representatives from Indian tribes-almost uniformly in praise of the purposes of these programs and in sup(cid:173)port of their extension. I believe the broad support of this bill lies in the fact that approved projects are designed to attack the roots of unem(cid:173)ployment through positive industrial de(cid:173)velopment and job creation, rather than 'through lateral income transfer pro(cid:173)grams. The importance of these EDA programs can be demonstrated by the success of the Economic Resources Cor(cid:173)poration in the development of the Watts Industrial Park in Los Angeles. ",
            "604": "21306 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE June 26, 1974 the most remarkable men who found a ca(cid:173)reer in the System. The Federal Reserve has experienced many stormy periods in its history, but the years 1949-51 were undoubtedly among the storm(cid:173)iest. The major issue was the Federal Re(cid:173)serve's struggle to regain its statutory in(cid:173)dependence, especially in its government bond open market operations, against the strong opposition of the Secretary of the Treasury, who was supported by the Presi(cid:173)dent. After a long period of travan, we ap(cid:173)pointed Win in early 1951 and urged the Treasury to appoint Bill Martin to negotiate the basic differences between us and to con(cid:173)tinue their efforts unt11 they had reached a mutually satisfactory agreement. At the time I used the expression of put(cid:173)ting them in a room together, locking the doors, and keeping the key until they were ready to come out. I might say the Treas(cid:173)ury accepted this suggestion with some re(cid:173)luctance because they wanted to start at a lower staff level. These two wonderful men did finally agree, and they came out after a few days--and only a few days--with an agreement which we now refer to as \"The Accord\", which I think is one of the most outstanding documents and achievements in Federal Reserve history. Bill Martin and especially Win Reifier, as architects of the Accord, have never been given full credit for their magnificent achievement. If they had not accomplished what they did, the Federal Reserve would be in a very feeble position to combat in(cid:173)fiation-the lnfiation which we had then as well as the infiation in which we are now. It was fortunllite for the country that Pres(cid:173)ident Truman appointed Bill Martin to suc(cid:173)ceed me as Chairman. He and Win, working harmoniously together, established a new high record of excellence in Federal Reserve performance. I never worked with any one who had a keener and more imaginative mind than Win or knew more about the disciplines in which he had been trained. It was a delight to work with him because he was a genuinely friendly person with complete integrity, a wonderful sense of humor, keen zest for life, and a natural hum1Uty that endeared him to his colleagues. My wife and I were happy to visit Win and Dorothy at their Florida home shortly before Win's death. They were a devoted and in(cid:173)separable couple, and I will always cherish that visit with those dear and. long-time friends as a wonderful time of reminiscence about Washington and good talk about cur(cid:173)rent events. The words of Shelly in memory of his friend John Keats seem appropriate: \"He has outsoared the shadow of our night He is secure, and now can never mourn A heart grown cold, A head grown gray in vain. \"He is made one with nature; there is heard His voice in all her music He is a presence to be felt and known In darkness and in light. \"He is a portion of that loveliness Which once he made more lovely And his works do live after him.\" REMARKS BY C. RICHARD YOUNGDAHL My comments about Win will be made from a slightly different perspective than the previous speaker. I was a junior official, I wouldn't even say officer, in the Federal Re(cid:173)serve at the time that I first came to know him. I knew Win Riefl.er as a friend, human(cid:173)itarian, and nature lover, economist, central banker, massive intellect and analytical genius. One could go on and on. I knew him best at the Board in the early 50's, and I saw all of these qualities and many more dis(cid:173)played in abundance. When Win returned to the System shortly before the Korean War, inflation was the number one economic problem. A huge Fed-eral debt was paralyzing Federal Reserve ef(cid:173)forts to curb bank credit and monetary ex(cid:173)pansion, and the Board had spent a number of fruitless years trying to sell to the country a secondary reserve plan that would have tied up a part of the Federal debt held by the banking system. Win showed a little or no interest in the many variations of these bank reserve plans. He perceived that the problem was far broader; that the Federal debt, when supported in price by the Fed(cid:173)eral Reserve System, constituted instant liquidity no matter who held it. Since the economy was over-liquid the need was to remove the supports on the Government security market. As we've heard, Win played a key role in this effort and in its ultimate negotiation with the Treasury. I would like to recall an incident that hap(cid:173)pened slightly in advance of the time when Win and Chairman Martin got together. It was in the summer of 1950 shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War and just at the time that the Federal Reserve :O.ad the temerity to raise the discount rate-r be(cid:173)lieve it was from 1Y:z to 1% per cent, I for(cid:173)get the exact amount. Immediately the Treasury rushed out and announced refunding terms that were ab(cid:173)solutely completely out of accord with the new level of the discount rate, and Win con(cid:173)ceived the strategy at the time that made it possible for the Fed to proceed with its policies. And that strategy was to buy up all the maturing securities, and I believe there were some $4 billion dollars or more involved, accept the refunding offering which the Treasury was offering, take it all into the Federal Reserve portfolio, and proceed to sell out of the Federal Reserve portfolio at higher interest rates an equivalent amount of other things. '\u00b7 \u00b7~ Now the Treasury accomplished its refund(cid:173)ing, but it was also put on notice by that action that the Fed was no longer a per(cid:173)manent captive of Treasury requirements. Win had developed the open market equiv(cid:173)alent of the pass or run option. The ultimate development of the Treasury(cid:173)Federal Reserve accord in early 1951, with Win as a k.ey negotiator, had its seed in this small element of flexibiUty from Treasury refunding domination that Win was able to devise. But Win's efforts to remove from the econ(cid:173)omy the excess liquidity of the Federal debt did not end with the accord. Freedom to stop supporting Treasury security prices did not automatically bring a free market ln Government securities. The dealer market itself, long dependent on the Fed for guid(cid:173)ance, had to be strengthened and broadened, and this strengthening was slow in develop(cid:173)ing. A Board study of the market functioning in which Win, again, played a dominant role, revealed a vestigial concern by dealers as to Fed Open Market intentions that kept the market in a crippled and dependent condi(cid:173)tion. Win's thesis was that open market activity should be confined to the shortest term sec(cid:173)tor of the market, that part of the market which is the broadest and the nearest to money itself, and in particular the Treasury bills. The market would then be free to find its own relationships without fear of Fed inter(cid:173)vention to impose a yield structure of the Fed's own choosing. The \"bills usually\" doc\u00b7 trine was adopted and followed for years. Even though now repealed in form it is still followed largely in substance. It is hard to imagine what the Government security market and indeed the entire econ(cid:173)omy would be like today if Win's !nsights of the early 50's had not so changed the nature of the Fed's Open Market role. But for me Win was much much more than the brilliant central banker. Win was a. kind and considerate person who brought these qualities into every contact with his associates. In open meetings, small groups, and private discussions, he cared about peo(cid:173)ple as individuals. His towering intellect was never used to overpower but rather to lead and to help a person find the answer him(cid:173)self. I remember with pleasure the many hours I was privileged to spend with him in a small morning group where we looked at the problems of the times. The analytical capacity of the Riefler mind was a marvel to observe. My wife and I treasure the social times we had with Deezie and Win. We remember the home that they fashioned out of two small houses, imaginatively tying them together with a large high-beamed living room that kept the charm of the old and gave utmty to the totality. We remember Win the gardener, Win the grass expert, Win the builder, but most dearly we treasure the memory of Win the friend. REMARKS BY WM. M'CHESNEY MARTIN, JR. Both Cynthia and I appreciate this oppor(cid:173)tunity to be here and pay tribute to Win Riefler. I know he would have enjoyed being here and seeing so many of his good friends and associates. You have heard several com(cid:173)ments on how fortunate we all have \u00b7been to know him and what an inspiration he has been to us all in many ways. Now obviously there is very little I can add to what the previous speakers have said except on a personal basis. It was my good fortune to work with Win Riefler during the time that Tom McCabe has said was the most difficult time in the Federal Reserve's history-and I won't challenge that, although I'm sure it's had many difficult times and. wl:l have many more difficult times. But I give Win Riefler full credit for whatevel\" came out of the Treasury-Federal Reserve-. accord. He was the keystone, and 1t was his. analytical mind and his tolerance and at the same time his wlllingness to compromise the important principle which made that accord possible. I had known him very slightly before that time, and as Assistant. Secretary of the Treasury was given the authority to enter into those negotiations .. and Win was more than responsive but just like rock when it came to the fundamentals. I think that this is a trait t~at we all rec(cid:173)ognize and we admire when it has along with it an ability to be tolerant of other people and tolerant of lesser minds. And I say in no sense of false modesty that Win Riefler's in(cid:173)tellect was infinitely superior to mine, that he had a bigger grasp and a greater grasp of finance and financial activities than I had, and therefore it made it possible for me to(cid:173)enter into my later duties as Chairman o! the Federal Reserve, secure in the knowledge that his view of independence of the Federal Reserve was based on independence within the Government but not independence of the Government, that he fully appreciated the importance of money, and sound money, but at the same time he didn't want money to be our master, he wanted it to be our servant. And in the sense that he was pursuing sound monetary policies, he was pursuing them with an understanding that unless we had sound money we would be servants and not masters of that money. This is some(cid:173)thing that all of us, I think, must recognize. The Federal Reserve System has been blessed with a great many competent people(cid:173)but none more competent or more dedicated than Win Rieft.er, and he rendered a service which is recognized by this group here today and by many more who could not be her& today. And I, as Chairman for a short period of time and working with him, am very glad to testify to the contribution which he made to the work of the Federal Reserve System and to finance in this country. Cynthia and I had the privilege of travel(cid:173)ing with Win on several occasions and every(cid:173)thing that's been said here about him is true. He enjoyed a zest for life. I remembel\" ",
            "654": "21356 EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS June 26, 197 4 it is a sensible compromise between two con(cid:173)fiicting national interests-the need to pro(cid:173)duce fuel at a. reasonable price and the need to preserve the environment. The House should adopt it, and a. conference committee should reconcile 1t with a. blll already passed by the Senate to give the nation its first effective regulation of a practice that is chewing up 1,200 acres of land a week. The bill would require strip miners to re(cid:173)store the land to its \"approximate original contour.\" This goal is technologically and economically feasible in most regions, as some operators already have shown. Restoring the land will increase the cost of coal, but in most cases t~e additional cost ts acceptable. In the fiat plains of Wyoming and Montana, stripped land can be restored for pennies per ton, according to a. recent study by the National Academy of Sciences. Elsewhere, the cost would be higher, exceed(cid:173)ing $1 a. ton in some areas. Even so, strip(cid:173)mined coal wlll still be cheaper than deep(cid:173)mined coal. In areas where restoration is not possible, stripping would have to stop. But the House blll would give the industry three years to shift to seams where reclamation is feasi(cid:173)ble. The unworked areas could remain as a national reserve, awaiting future technology that would make restoration practical. The bill would also protect land owuers who do not own mineral rights to the coal beneath them. The coal companies would have to get the written consent of the sur(cid:173)face owners. All in all, the bill provides the best trade(cid:173)off the nation can make. Both the industry and the environmentalists should stop carp(cid:173)ing and accept it. GRANGE CELEBRATES ANNIVERSARY lOOTH HON. MARVIN L. ESCH OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, June 26, 1974 Mr. ESCH. Mr. Speaker, next month the Plymouth, Mich., Grange will mark the lOOth anniversary of its service to the community. Formed to improve farming conditions and to obtain better roads for getting produce to market, it remains a nonsectarian and nonpoliti(cid:173)cal organization for anyone interested in farming. Modern farming techniques and equip(cid:173)ment have, of course, made very dramatic changes in the methods used on farms in America today. However, the spirit of rugged individualism and dedication to community and family remains a very integral part of farming in Plym0uth. That spirit will be renewed when the resi(cid:173)dents of Plymouth gather next month to mark the beginning of a new cen(cid:173)tury in the history of the Plymouth \u00b7Grange. The Plymouth Observer and Eccentric Tecently recounted the history of the Grange and its role in the community. I include it at this point in the RECORD. GRANGE To MARK 100TH ANNIVERSARY (By Sherry Kahan) PLYMOUTH.-The official big day is not un(cid:173)til July but members of the Plymouth Grange are already making plans for a celebration to honor the 100th anniversary of their farm(cid:173)oriented organization. Chartered in 1874 whEm Plymouth was a quiet island of a few shops and homes en-tirely surrounded by farms, the Grange was formed to improve farming conditions and to obtain better roads for getting produce to market. It was and stlll is a non-sectarian non(cid:173)political organization for anyone interested in farming. Unusual for its time, it gave women the same organization rights as men. Recently a number of Plymouth Grange members gathered in the second story of the building at 273 Union that since 1913 has been the permanent headquarters of the or(cid:173)ganization. They were meeting in a former hay loft for the building was once a stable for the carriage horses of Phil Markham, inventor of the air rifle. Markham once lived in the large house on the corner of Penniman and Union now owned by Jack Wilcox. Purchase price of the stable was $2,500. In those days one. of the attractions of Grange a1Iil.iation was the chance to take part in purchase contracts under which members bought supplies a.t reduced prices. When the word went out that the coal, binde.rs twine, feed or fence posts ordered were due in town, horses were hitched up all over the area. Down to the railroad siding rumbled dozens of wagons to pick up whatever was brought in that day. When Mrs. Louise Spicer Tritton joined the organization 52 years ago she lived six mile~ from town on the Spicer farm at Warren and Napier (now Pilgrim Hills subdivision). The original\u00b7land grant deed signed by President John Quincy Adams for this farm is still in the possession of her sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Norman, who continues to own 10 acres at the site. \"I was 14 when I joined,\" said Mrs. Tritton. \"My parents ate, slept and drank the Grange so it was perfectly natural for me to join too. People did things as a family then.\" Mrs. Mary Flllmore who joined in 1914 re(cid:173)called that the Grange had dinners as well as day meetings in those days, and one of the things talked about was having better roads. \"They've worked hard to get the Canton Center Road paved from Michigan Avenue to Plymouth,\" she said \"and this was done in 1915.\" The original box stalls and hay chute were still in the stable when the Grange took up its new residence. The wood was all brightly varnished possibly because the horses stabled there were considered the pride of the village. In 1932, a fire broke out in the Grange, reported Mrs. Hilda Lunn. It burned a hole up through the second tloor, destroyed rec(cid:173)ords and did enough damage so that the members had to meet in each others' homes until repair work could be completed. The building now has a meeting hall on both floors, a modern kitchen and the depot toilet is long gone. \"The Grange organization has worked hard to bring about such improvements in Amer(cid:173)ican life as rural free delivery, parcel post, the extension service of land grant colleges, rural electrification, pure food laws and so(cid:173)cial security,\" explained Mrs. Lunn who lives at 15854 Marilyn. According to Grange records, the organi(cid:173)zation used to hold a harvest picnic every year. In 1891 it was held on Belle Isle. To help the farm families pass the time in the winter the Grange had literary contests for two winters. In 1912-13, it offered prizes at rural school fairs for farm-oriented work done by the pupils. Reminiscing about Plymouth Mrs. FUl(cid:173)more recollected that the town: once had red brick pavements and street car tracks. \"It was a shame they covered up those bricks,\" she said. Jesse Tritton, a Grange member for-40 years and present Master of the organiza(cid:173)tion, could well be honored as a pioneer commuter. In the 30s he drove dally to a Chevrolet plant in Hamtramck, usually taking Schoolcraft to Davison and then to John R. The trip took about an hour and a half. \"Schoolcraft had two paved lanes and very little traffic,\" he said. His wife remembers that the park in the center of Plymouth once presented a rural picture that would delight Andrew Wyeth or even Norman Rockwell. Along Ann Arbor Trail were hitching posts to which Mrs. Trit(cid:173)ton often hitched her horse and buggy. A tank full of water for horses stood to one side. For a while a bandstand, frequently filled with local musicians, was a part of the park scene. A severe ice storm in March 1922 damaged many of the trees in this park. Saturday night movies were shown on the streets in the center of town from 1915 to about 1920. A large curtain was draped over the area where the S.S. Kresge store is now located. Across the street a projector was set up, with the viewers in between. Mrs. Tritton spent eight years in the one(cid:173)room Hanford School at Hanford and Ridge. This was not because she failed to be pro(cid:173)moted. It was a school taught by one teacher for about 25 to 30 children scattered through eight grades. Transportation was a problem for her when she had to come into town to attend high school, then at Main and Church. The build(cid:173)ing, now Central School, was a 12-grade in(cid:173)stitution for town children. Rural students attended only during their high school years. Not being 14, Mrs. Tritton was unable to obtain a driver's license. \"But just to school and back,\" she said. \"I could only run errands if I had written permission from my parents.\" Most of these Grange oldtimers regret the passing of the rural era they remember. \"When I came in to high school it was ex(cid:173)tremely unusual for me to run into someone I didn't know,\" observed Mrs. Tritton. Mr. Fillmore finds himself getting a little angry now and again at the thought of good farming land now being swallowed up by housing developments. \"Some of those money hogs have rocks in their heads,\" he said. \"There are plenty of places around with sandy soil that could serve their purpose just as well.\" Trying to adapt and build for the future, the Grange two years ago started a Junior Grange for young people between the ages of five and 14. It emphasizes such things as woodworking, a growing project, cookie making, and occasionally some needlecraft. At the present time a member no longer has to be an active farmer, it is open to any(cid:173)one with an interest in farming. \"Anyone who eats ought to be interested in farming,\" concluded Mrs. Tritton.

Mr. Speaker, last week the House passed the 1975 Trans(cid:173)portation Department appropriation, and in so doing approved a $4 million cut in the budget for the alcohol safety action programs--commonly called ASAPs.

Thes~ activities include the inventory, coordmation and dissemination of all nonclassified and nonproprietary gov(cid:173)ernmental scientific and technical infor(cid:173)mation to other countries upon request. It would also establish a mechanism to provide the recipient countries, on a re(cid:173)imbursable basis, with referrals and ac(cid:173)cess to copyrighted and proprietary in(cid:173)formation and consulting services of American firms. While most of us have become pain(cid:173)fully aware that existing technology taken \"off the shelf\" is of little value in meeting the needs of developing nations, it could be adapted or tailored to fit the requirements of these nations should an improved system of coordinating the flow of scientific and technical information be established. We must recognize, however, that the gap between developed and developing countries includes more than simply a matter of providing equipment and services. It also includes a severe short(cid:173)age of education and opportunities in less developed countries, especially in the fields of science and technology. For all too long now, the United States has nearly monopolized its techni,cal ex(cid:173)pertise and scientific information-albeit for a number of good reasons. Neverthe(cid:173)less, we have been the beneficiaries of these advancements while others in the world, many with the wealth, will, and capacity to utilize much of this priceless information, have been forced to watch from the sidelines. While in the short run, the effects of this unintentional pol(cid:173)icy or practice have been \u00b7somewhat neg(cid:173)ligible, the long-term effects will be pro(cid:173)found. Whereas to the extent that other nations are aided, the rest of the world benefits, it follows that to the extent that they are forgotten or neglected, the rest of the world sacrifices. Although the effect of this legislation may not be that less developed coun(cid:173)tries are transformed into modem, in(cid:173)dustrialized societi~es in the U.S. mold, I am convinced that its enactment would help immeasurably in the develop(cid:173)ment and assistance of many of these countries throughout the world. New sys(cid:173)tems are needed to meet new demands, and the number of demands for greater technological improvement has been un(cid:173)precedented in recent years. Never before in the history of this country has there been a greater need for the community of nations to work together on constructive and progressive activities rather than those that con(cid:173)tribute to distrust and con:fiict. This leg(cid:173)islation will allow us to serve that need through a refined communication system among nations as well as an improved coordination and dissemination of Amer(cid:173)ican scientific and technological infor(cid:173)mation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con(cid:173)sent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD as follows: ' s. 3716 A bill to facil1tate the transfer of science and technology and increase cooperation between the United States and other na(cid:173)tions \u00b7through the full utilization of global telecommunication services Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, TITLE I-8HORT TITLE, DECLARATION OF POLICY AND DEFINITIONS SHORT TITLE SEc. 101.

            "754": "21456 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE June 27, 1974 ysis\" may operate to lock a tribe into a range of funding which may be insuf(cid:173)ficient to meet their educational needs. Second, as I understand it, each tribe is given a list of Bureau programs on which they make their judgments con(cid:173)cerning levels of funding. The Johnson(cid:173)O'Malley program apparently is in(cid:173)cluded on such a list despite the fact that in most cases a local school district is the administering agency. By including Johnson-O'Malley as a program subject to \"Band Analysis\" a tribe may give more emphasis to programs it adminis(cid:173)ters directly rather than one that affects the tribe indirectly. The result may be a distortion of Johnson-O'Malley needs since given the choice the tribe would quite naturally support programs that affected the tribe directly. Third, it may be highly inappropriate for a tribal council to determine the needs of a local school district for John(cid:173)son-O'Malley funds, under \"Band Anal(cid:173)ysis\" if that tribal council did not con(cid:173)sult with the local school district and its governing board. In Arizona, I am told that none of the major impact Johnson(cid:173)O'Malley school districts were consulted by tribal councils in setting a priority for the Johnson-O'Malley program for this year's budget. If there is no link be(cid:173)tween the tribal council and the local school district over setting a priority for Johnson-O'M9.lley then one may con(cid:173)clude that the proposed Johnson-O'Mal(cid:173)Iey allocation for fiscal year 1975 does r:ot accurately reflect the need of those affected school districts. On the basis of my own analysis this conclusion would tJeem to be clearly justified. Fourth, by consulting only with the tribal council, \"Band Analysis\" defeats the role of the local JOM parent commit(cid:173)tee in developing, with the local school board, the annual JOM budget request, an objective which many Indian parents have long sought. The State request, which is a combinaton of all local school district requests, is by far more accurate in indicating need than \"Band Analysis\" and more reflective of Indian self-determination. Fifth, I might add that I am not really sure that a tribal council should be in(cid:173)volved at all in setting priorities for Johnson-O'Malley since by doing so it is intervening in the affairs of a local pub(cid:173)lic school district unless, of course, the tribe was holding a JOM contract. It would be even more inappropriate in those cs.ses where the local school board was composed of a majority of Indians. Again, in Arizona two-thirds of the ma(cid:173)jor impact school districts are governed by school boards composed of a major(cid:173)ity of Indians. If \"Band Analysis\" in its \"Operations ignores the local Indian school board, as it apparently has in Arizona, Indian self-determination is eroded. Finally, \"Band Analysis\" is essentially a mechanism or technique to control ex(cid:173)penditures which in its operation may or may not have any relationship to pro(cid:173)gram considerations. Certainly there can be no doubt that in regard to the 1975 JOM budget \"Band Analysis\" fails to appreciate the basic objectives of the .JOM program. Indian education pro-grams like JOM cannot hope to succeed when guided by a budgetary system like \"Band Analysis.\" When a budget system creates a condition that overlooks basic program needs then that program loses its capacity to realize its own objectives; a situation we can hardly tolerate in regard to Indian education. Mr. President, instead of basing the allocation of JOM funds on meeting the costs of increased student enrollment, the 1975 JOM funds are to be allocated on the basis of the relative priority that tribes assign to the JOM program. This explains the inequities which exist in this year's proposed allocation. It hardly seems fair to local school districts and JOM parental committees to have the allocation of Johnson-O'Malley funds determined on a basis other than need. If unlimited funds were available to meet the needs of the Johnson-O'Malley pro(cid:173)gram then perhaps the problem would not be so great, but when JOM funds are limited, as they are, then it is clearly inequitable to allocate funds on any basis other than educational need as those di(cid:173)rectly responsible for educational pro(cid:173)grams see them. If a budget system like ''Band Analysis\" distorts need and ar(cid:173)ranges funding which results in clear inequities, that system should be re(cid:173)placed. But the real loser, of course, is the Indian student. If the Johnson(cid:173)O'Malley 1975 funds are allocated under the present plan then a number of schools are going to find less funds be(cid:173)hind each child to meet their educational programs. The Phoenix area of Arizona, for ex(cid:173)ample, under the proposed 1975 alloca(cid:173)tion will lose $250,000 but will experience a student enrollment increase of over 5,000 students. This would mean that Arizona will realize a loss in per pupil support compared to 1973 and 1974. In 1973 Arizona, under JOM, was provided $204 for each Indian student which dropped to $199 in 1974. Under the 1975 allocation it will drop again to $188-a loss of $16 over 1974 and $22 over 1973. Yet the budget justification argues that the so-called increase in funding will \"permit the various public schools to re(cid:173)turn to fiscal 1973 levels of support per pupil.\" This last discrepancy in the 1975 budget only confirms that the proposed allocation fails to meet its own objec(cid:173)tives. This system makes no sense and I am convinced that the Congress will be mak(cid:173)ing a serious mistake if it approves the allocation of the 1975 JOM budget on the basis of \"Band Analysis.\" In this regard, I have strongly urged the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee to allocate funds on the basis of State need and not \"Band Analysis.\" It is my hope that the Appropriations Committee will review this issue and, if possible, rt::place the \"Band Analysis\" allocation system with one which will be fair, equitable, and based on a realistic view of local-educa(cid:173)tional need and not on the apparent dis(cid:173)tortions created by the \"Band Analysis\" system. Finally, Mr. President, I recognize my responsibility to develop a legislative solution to this problem and I intend to pursue that objective since it is unfair to have the Appropriations Committee assume that burden. Certainly, \"Band Analysis\" as applied to the Johnson(cid:173)O'Malley program raises serious ques(cid:173)tions as to whether the allocation of funds under JOM meets Congressional intent. For the BIA to institute, admin(cid:173)istratively, an allocation system which has never been considered by Congress and which may be at variance with con(cid:173)gressional intentions, is in my mind, a serious error especially in the face of de(cid:173)termined congressional efforts to legis(cid:173)late reforms of the entire Johnson(cid:173)O'Malley program. The discrepancies and inequities which are clearly reflected in the 1975 JOM budget only support the need for review of the JOM program and the need for early reform. In this regard, it makes little sense to establish a new allocation system until Congress has a chance to consider the best ap(cid:173)proach to this problem. The allocation of JOM funds is the prerogative of Con(cid:173)gress and any changes in that system should be determined by Congress and not the Bureau of Indian Affairs. CONCLUSION Mr. President, over the past few years we have experienced great momentum in developing quality Indian education programs and in providing increased re(cid:173)sources to meet the requirements of those programs. Yet, that momentum could be threatened if the \"Band Analy(cid:173)sis\" budgetary system is allowed\u00b7 to op(cid:173)erate the Johnson-O'Malley program. I do not doubt for a minute the sincere motivations of those who urged the use of \"Band Analysis\" in allocating JOM funds. But obviously it just is not work(cid:173)ing. If we permit a system like ''Band Analysis\" to determine levels of support without reference to the actual needs of local educational agencies then the role of Johnson-O'Malley as a major force in Indian education programs will be eroded. This, to me, would be unaccept(cid:173)able, not only to those schools affected by JOM but, more importantly, to our Indian citizens and their dreams for educational attainment. The threat to the educational opportunities for Indian children is real under \"Band Analysis\" and it is for this reason that I find such a system inequitable and clearly inap(cid:173)propriate in meeting the need of those public schools which are on the front line in providing a quality Indian educa(cid:173)tion program. THE GENOCIDE CONVENTION Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, on June 16, 1949, the Genocide Convention was transmitted to the Senate by Presi(cid:173)dent Truman who urged that it be ratified. Every administration since 1949 has supported the Genocide Convention. Most recently, President Nixon urged the Senate \"to consider anew this important convention and to grant its advice and consent to ratification.'' Such action, said the President, \"will demonstrate unequivocally our country's desire to participate in the building of interna(cid:173)tional order based on law and justice.\" Despite this continuing bipartisan sup(cid:173)port for the convention, the Senate has responded neither favorably nor with due ",
            "804": "21506 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE June 27, 197 4 to students, he concluded that cooperative education lapwelds theory from the class(cid:173)room with practice on the job. Cooperative education creates a weld that is much stronger than the buttwelding of a college degree followed by employment, the two touching at only one line of contact. For five years now the Office of Education has been administering a small program of grants in support of cooperative education. We have observed the various successful working operations of cooperative educa(cid:173)tion-and we have learned a lot about it. We have learned that cooperative educa(cid:173)tion is based on the principle that well-edu(cid:173)cated, mature individuals will develop more effectively through an educational pattern which, at periodic intervals, places them in a world beyond the campus. Through these controlled and structured experiences, which are most often paid positions in business and industry, and the public employer sector, the students bring an enrichment to the class(cid:173)room and the employer which enhances their total development. We have learned that, for students, the alteration of work and study provides a ca(cid:173)reer education that enhances personal growth and development, lends relevance to curriculum, and teaches skills in human re(cid:173)lations through experiences in the adult world. It makes higher education financially possible for many students because of their earnings on job assignments in their coop(cid:173)erative education work periods. It is for these reasons that Dr. Peter Muir(cid:173)head recently said that \"Cooperative educa(cid:173)tion may become the major breakthrough of the 1970's for students, for faculty involve(cid:173)ment, for institutions of higher education, and for employers.\" \u00b7 The Federal government has inaugurated and established a program for furthering the national expansion of cooperative education. The Higher Education Act provides for an expenditure of $10,750,000 this year and next year in support of cooperative education. Requests for grants to establish or expand cooperative education have come from hun(cid:173)dreds of community colleges, colleges and universities-both public and private-from all of the fifty states. The expansion of cooperative education, With the support of the Federal government, ls regarded by many educational leaders as the single most important development in higher education today. In June, 1972, there were 350 institutions of higher education offering cooperative education opportunities for students. In June, 1973, there were 566 colleges, universities, and community colleges offering programs of cooperative education in a Wide diversity of curricula. Currently, in May, 1974, there are more 800 institutions of higher educating offering cooperative edu(cid:173)-cation programs serving over 180,000 stu(cid:173)dents. This is ten times the number of students ln these programs fifteen years ago. Given -continuing Congressional funding of the co(cid:173)operative education legislation, there is a prospect that 500,000 students Will be in co(cid:173)\u00b7operative education programs by 1980. It is this growth in cooperative education that has led the U.S. Office of Education to give support to the National Commission's effort to organize a series of Regional Em(cid:173)ployer Institutes. This Detroit Institute to(cid:173)day begins the process of informing em(cid:173)ployers about the increasing availability of students in cooperative education programs. For it is essential to say that the further expansion of cooperative education-its pro(cid:173)jected growth-is dependent upon increas(cid:173)ing employer knowledge about the cost-ben(cid:173)efit experience that employers have had in hiring cooperative education students. The Office of Education realizes that ade(cid:173)quate data on cost-benefit employer experi(cid:173)ence would have important usefulness toed(cid:173)ucators as a tool to enable them to provide employers with answers to their question: What is the effect on \"the bottom line\" figure for our business if we employ coop(cid:173)erative education students? There are existing only two examples of the needed cost-benefit informwtion. Xerox has made an internal study which reveals(cid:173)and I quote-\"Xerox has made very sub(cid:173)stantial savings in its personnel recruitment costs through employing cooperative educa(cid:173)tion students.\" A second study was made by South Central Bell of nine years of their employer experiences, and they found-and I quote-\"The Study revealed that the cost of employing and retaining each Co-op grad(cid:173)uate was 40% less expensive than employing and retaining a regular college graduate.\" It is the prospect of uncovering useful data of this kind that has led the Office of Education to make two grants this year aimed at persuading leading corporations to undertake internal studies of their own cost(cid:173)benefit experience in that employers cooper(cid:173)ate and support these useful investigations. Business and industry will find it worth(cid:173)while to appraise their experience. The pre(cid:173)liminary studies show that there is an un(cid:173)recognized dollar return to employers who hire cooperative education students. But there is a further dimension of coop(cid:173)erative education that should be of interest to employers as taxpayers and as citizens. We all know that many institutions of higher education have catastrophic financial prob(cid:173)lems. \u2022 Because of financial distress, 37 colleges closed last year. The College Entrance Examination Board has recently stated that the cost of higher education to a student in the coming year will be 9.4% greater than last year-and 36% more than it was four years ago. Meeting the costs of a college education is a problem that more and more American fam1lies are finding more difficult each year. The educational institutions, like business and industry, are beset by an inflation that is officially announced in the latest report as running at an annual rate of 14.5%. To com(cid:173)pound the difficulty, education budgets and programs for federally-funded support of higher education are all established and based on estimates that are, in general, made two years ago-and thereby there is a further lag behind the pace of inflation. Within this context, it is useful to con(cid:173)sider the economic position of the coopera(cid:173)tive education student. At Northeastern University, the largest cooperative educa(cid:173)tion institution, with 16,000 full-time stu(cid:173)dents, the average student earnings for the 26 weeks the student expends in his two job periods are $3,350 this year. With a small amount of assistance from his family or a small loan of $400 to $700 a year, the student is able to meet his col(cid:173)lege education costs. Total student-earned income in jobs the cooperative education program Northeastern University is $37,000,000 year. Cooperative education is a way of drawing into the economy the productivity of. stu(cid:173)dents to meet the ever-mounting costs of higher education-and have this produc(cid:173)tivity be a part of an organized educational program. In Congress, both Republicans and Dem(cid:173)ocrats have joined in the bi-partisan intro(cid:173)duction and enactment of legislation by Congress supporting cooperative education legislation. Cooperative education is a response to the realization that industry and education need to work together on pressing problems of education. In recent years educational leaders of black institutions have begun to see the possibilities of cooperative education pro(cid:173)grams. in at this Ten years ago there were no black colleges offering cooperative education programs. Now there are more than fifty. More than three-fourths of the black institutions of higher education have been currently ap(cid:173)plying to the U.S. Office of Education for grants to establish and expand programs of cooperative education. Ten years ago there was only one com \u2022 munity college offering its students the op(cid:173)portunity of a cooperative education pro(cid:173)gram. As a consequence of Congress estab(cid:173)lishing a national public policy to favor and assist the expansion of cooperative educa(cid:173)tion, there are now several hundred commu(cid:173)nity and junior colleges that have started coope\u00b7rative education programs. For exam(cid:173)ple, there are now 20 community colleges in Michigan, 43 community colleges in Califor(cid:173)nia, and nine community colleges in Wash(cid:173)ington that have programs of cooperative education. Ten years ago there were 19 state institu(cid:173)tions of higher education that had coopera(cid:173)tive education programs, almost entirely in the fields of engineering and science. Now there are more than two hundred. These additional institutions of higher education have received grants from the U.S. Office of Education that encouraged them and en(cid:173)abled them to undertake to establish co(cid:173)operative education. In the fall of 1973, there were 640 institutions of higher education that requested OE support for co-oping programs. It would seem likely that with continuing adequate Federal support for this educa(cid:173)tional program, that Within five years there will be at least 1,000 institutions of higher education offering cooperative education programs. It is of use to state candidly that achiev(cid:173)ing change in higher education is fraught with difficulty. It requires tenacity. It re(cid:173)quires a strategy of reinforcing success. It requires that the educational innovation is seen to have advantages from many differ(cid:173)ent viewpoints-and that this becomes ob(cid:173)vious to many by inspection of the process and the consequences for the students and society. Plato said, \"What is honored in a country is cultivated there.\" European travelers to America in the early 19th century gave many accounts of how in America \"All honest call(cid:173)ings are honorable,\" as Toqueville reported. The respect for hard work was widespread, and the American definition of a gentleman was to be found in his answer to the ques(cid:173)\u00b7tion, \"What do you do?\" and not to the ques(cid:173)tion of \"Who are you?\" America was built by a people in a hurry. They built it using a work ethic. It is obvi(cid:173)ous that the influence of such a system of values creates a highly productive economy. Town and country have competed with each other in industrious pursuits, machines invented, new lines of communication estab(cid:173)lished, the frontiers reached and passed. The universal and sincere faith that Americans have had in the power of education is one of the most remarkable feartures of America. A great part of our strength has been that the effort made in America to spread use(cid:173)ful education is truly prodigious. Historically, work has held a position of honor in America. We take this for granted, but European travelers to America in the 19th century did not. They were astonished at what they saw. Work was honored and the educated man was looked upon With suspi(cid:173)cion. Historically, liberal arts education has been thought of as a practical and useful ed(cid:173)ucation-which is an error. Work has not been part of our concept of the process of education. Therefore, the meaning of a work and study program is not easlly seen by us. Aristotle said, \"The most difficult problem in the philosophy of education is the rela(cid:173)tionship between theory and practice.\" ",

Kleindienst to be Attorney Gen(cid:173)eral of the United States. SEc. 4. A copy of this resolution shall be transmitted to the Special Prosecutor as an answer to his request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the present consideration of the resolution? There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr. President, I shall not object, of course, to this resolution. But it might be useful to focus again on a point that I sought to make several da:vs ago when I inserted in the RECORD that letter from the President of the United States in which he declined to provide to the House Judiciary Com(cid:173)mittee, in response to a subpena, cer(cid:173)tain documents under the claim of Ex(cid:173)ecutive privilege. It is often said by some in Congress and some in the press, that there is no such thing as Executive privilege; that the President has no right to withhold anything from the scrutiny and exami(cid:173)nation of Congress. As we move to adopt this particular resolution, I suggest it is noteworthy that the legislative branch of Govern(cid:173)ment, the Senate in this case, claims a privilege as against the other branches with respect to the documents under con(cid:173)trol of the Senate, the minutes of a meet(cid:173)ing of a committee of the Senate, for ex(cid:173)ample. Rule XXX of the Senate, to which the distinguished majority whip has referred, stakes out a claim of privilege on the part of Senate and specifically prohibits any Member or employee of the Senate from producing any Senate documents except by consent of the Senate. I do not believe it is timely or appro(cid:173)priate to make any judgment at this time with respect to the existence or scope of executive privilege. But it is ap-propriate, I suggest, to take note of the fact that the legislative branch, as well as the executive branch, now and over the years, has asserted the claim of privilege. The resolution we are about to adopt makes it very precise that no court, no ordinary court, can require the Senate to produce evidence or documents except by the consent of the Senate. Ordinarily, the Senate does give that consent, but there have been occasions when the Sen(cid:173)ate has not. The judicial branch also maintains a privilege concerning its own delibera(cid:173)tions. Before the Supreme Court decides cases, it has secret meetings of its mem(cid:173)bers and discusses privately and can(cid:173)didly, among the members, how they will decide the case. The minutes and the proceedings of those secret meetings of the Justices of the Supreme Court are available to no one. If the House Judiciary Committee were ever to investigate, for purposes of im(cid:173)peachment, a Justice of the Supreme Court and sought to subpena the minutes or proceedings of those secret delibera(cid:173)tions of the Justices of the Supreme Court, I wonder what the response of that coequal branch of the Government would be. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President, I should like to add my own footnote to what the distinguished assistant Republican leader has said. The point we should keep in mind in all this discussion concerning the exec(cid:173)utive branch is this: Is there privilege? Does the Executive, does the legislative branch, does the judicial branch have au(cid:173)thority, under the Constitution, to claim privilege when it comes to withholding evidence that bears upon the possible commission of a crime? I have never doubted that some form of executive privilege exists. But where there is evidence bearing upon possible criminality, I seriously doubt that the doctrine of executive privilege can be in(cid:173)voked by any body of the Government. So long as that evidence is relevant, so long as it bears upon the commission of a crime, so long as it does not involve the vital national security interests of this country, I doubt that any claim of executive privilege can validly be made by any branch of the Government. Second, I also want to call attention to the fact that the House Judiciary Com(cid:173)mittee, in conducting an impeachment inquiry, is engaged in carrying out one of the highest constitutional functions mandated by the Constitution and in(cid:173)cumbent upon any branch of the Gov(cid:173)ernment. It is the constitutional duty of that committee to seek all relevant evi(cid:173)dence bearing upon possible impeach(cid:173)able offenses. I think it is the duty of the President of the United States-as the Chief Ex(cid:173)ecutive of this country and as the officer who has the responsibility. under the Constitution, to take care that the laws are faithfully executed-to respond to the House Judiciary Committee's legiti(cid:173)mate requests for any relevant evidence bearing upon the possible commission of a crime or bearing upon any possible im-peachable offenses. If the doctrine of ex(cid:173)ecutive privilege can validly be invoked against the House Judiciary Committee in its legitimate and constitutional func(cid:173)tion of seekng all information so that it can make an objective and fair and rea(cid:173)soned judgment as to whether or not im(cid:173)peachable offenses exist, then indeed any President, by simply invoking the so(cid:173)called doctrine of executive privilege, can stop all such inquiry and bring it to a halt. In that way, he could nullify or negate the clause of the Constitution which provides for impeachment of the Chief Executive of this country. While I do not at this moment attempt to take any position with respect to spe(cid:173)cific requests on the part of the House Judiciary Committee, I do not think that a parallel can be drawn in respect to the House Judiciary Committee's constitu(cid:173)tional function in this regard as against the rule that governs the submission of documents, and so forth, and the requir(cid:173)ing of information on the part of Sen(cid:173)ate employees such as that embraced in the resolution I have submitted on behalf of Mr. EASTLAND. Nor would I, as a Sen(cid:173)ator, ever defend the Senate, nor do I think any Senator would defend the Sen(cid:173)ate, nor do I think the Senate as an in(cid:173)stitution would interpose the Senate rule, in resistance to the submission of valid, relevant evidence in the possession of the Senate, if that evidence llore upon the possible commission of a crime. Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I yield. Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. He has given the Senate very helpful leadership in this regard. He is absolutely 100 percent right with respect to executive privilege. I have in my hand a copy of the Con(cid:173)stitution of the United States, and there is not one word in the Constitution about executive privilege. Indeed, one eminent historian has said that it was 1958 before the term was ever used. Raoul Berger, who is probably the most eminent expert in the world in this field, has argued that executive privilege is simply a matter of expedience. That makes sense. The Senator from Michigan has made a good point. We should not be able to take from the President of the United States any papers that may disclose na(cid:173)tional security matters of secrets of that kind. But this is a matter of convenience, a matter of commonsense, a matter of logic, not of absolute constitutional right. On the other hand, the House of Rep(cid:173)resentatives has a constitutional re(cid:173)sponsibility with respect to impeach(cid:173)ment. It is very clear in the Constitution. So for us to permit the Executive to in(cid:173)terpose some new motion of executive privilege to frustrate the proper role of Congress to investigate, as we must do in order to fulfill our obligations, seems to me to be unconstitutional, unwise, and improper. Mr. President, one of the most vital functions that the Senate and the House have is the function of investigation, and by the President using this notion of executive privilege, that function has been frustrated and frustrated badly.

            "904": "21606 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE June 27, 197 4 the gentleman is certainly justified in calling this to our attention, let me say that obviously if there is no laboratory accreditation program, if there is no such a thing, then these 11 positions the gen(cid:173)tleman is talking about that are in(cid:173)cluded in the bill for this purpose will certainly not be needed. As far as I am concerned, that will be the intention of this Committee, that is, that these posi(cid:173)tions should not then be filled, and that the funds, of course, appropriated for them should not be used until the reg(cid:173)ulations can show that they are needed. Mr. STEIGER of Wisconsin. I very much appreciate the response of the Chairman on that question. Mr. MICHEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 minutes. Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, in view of the number of people who are on the floor here, rather than continuing to talk to ourselves, it might very well serve a purpose to simply extend our remarks at this point in the RECORD. But I do not believe that would be altogether appropriate. As the gentleman from Pennsylvania <Mr. FLooD) indicated, during the course of his remarks, he will be making a rather extensive extension of his remarks on certain specific items, as will this Mem(cid:173)ber and, I am sure, other members of the subcommittee. We have over 300 line items and to go over them item by item in detail I think would unduly take up the time of the Committee of the Whole. But if I might, I should like to address myself to some of the highlights, and several items that I am somewhat concerned about. Mr. GROSS. Mr. Chairman, will gentleman yield? Mr. MICHEL. I yield to my dear friend, the gentleman from Iowa. Mr. GROSS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. This is a bill which in all of its rami(cid:173)fications, as I understand the statement of the gentleman from Pennsylvania <Mr. FLooD), entails the spending of about $121 billion. Would the gentleman suggest we get 5 or 10 more Members to add to the 15 or 20 now on the House floor? That is about all a quorum call will produce under the bobtailed procedure that we have indulged ourselves in this phony quorum call procedure in the Committee of the Whole. Mr. MICHEL. I am not all that en(cid:173)thralled with my own voice, I will say to the gentleman from Iowa. We will try to make our case just as briefly as we can here. There is no question but what the real nitty-gritty of the debate will follow dur(cid:173)ing the course of reading the bill when there will be amendments offered. And the gentleman will, of course, I hope, op(cid:173)pose those to increase the bill, as I will, and he might very well be supporting some of those amendments that will be offered to cut the bill. Mr. GROSS. If my friend, the gentle(cid:173)man from Illinois, will yield further, if he feels at any time that he needs more companionship, I will be glad to try to provide it. the Mr. MICHEL. I appreciate the gentle(cid:173)man's cooperative attitude. In this case it would be very cooperative if we could simply move ahead with discussion of the bill referring, as I said, to several of the highlights. Mr. HALEY. Mr. Chairman, I make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The CHAffiMAN. Evidently a quorum is not present. The Chair announces that he will va(cid:173)cate proceedings under the call when a quorum of the Committee appears. Members will record their presence by electronic device. The call was taken by electronic de-vice. QUORUM CALL VACATED its busi(cid:173)The CHAIRMAN. 101 Members have appeared. A quorum of the Committee of the Whole is present. Pursuant to rule XXIII, clause 2, further proceedings un(cid:173)der the call shall be considered as vacated. The Committee will resume ness. The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. MICHEL) had been recognized and at the time of the point of order had 8 minutes remaining. Mr. MICHEL. Mr. Chairman, as I was about to say when we were interrupted by the suggestion of the absence of a quorum, there are a great many de(cid:173)ferred items that will not show up in this bill, budgeted at $4.6 billion, and these items Members will find displayed on page 6 of our report. So, as our chair(cid:173)man has indicated to the Members, we bring to the floor a bill of $32.8 billion without $4.6 billion of deferred items, which suggests that if we have no in(cid:173)crease in the future on these deferred items we would have something in the neighborhood of $37 to $38 billion of ap(cid:173)propriated funds here to add to the $92.5 billion of trust funds. My concern is the fact that we show a figure here of $386 million under the budget. This has got to be-and the chairman and I would have some differ(cid:173)ence as to how it would be character(cid:173)ized-for all inJt.ents and purposes a phony cut in the bill. It comes to the floor, as I said, showing a net reduction of $386 million below the President's budget, but the Members should be aware that the figure is achieved through a reduction of more than $878 million in estimates for public assist(cid:173)ance. In other words, if the administra(cid:173)tion's estimates are right and the com(cid:173)mittee's estimates are wrong, the bill will be considerably above the President's budget-and the word \"estimates\" is very critical here and important. Public assistance is not controllable by congressional action. By law the Fed(cid:173)eral Government must pay its share of any legitimate welfare costs incurred by the States. In the end we will have to appropriate the necessary amount cover those legitimate costs. If the ad(cid:173)ministration has overestimated them, the budget authority will revert to the Treasury. If the committee has under(cid:173)estimated them, we will have to provide a supplemental appropriation. to I see the gentleman from Iowa out here in front of me, who makes the point time and time again on the floor of this House, opposed to bringing in supple(cid:173)mental requests. This, of course, is one of those things that I would have to predict will happen on this particular item. The question is, who is more right here or more wrong about the estimates? For years both the administration and the Congress have accepted the estimates of the 50 States which are made consid(cid:173)erably in advance of the fiscal year. As the committee report notes, for 11 years in a row these State estimates were vastly underestimated and the Congress had to vote supplementals for those years. The fiscal year 1973 was a stand(cid:173)off year. The original estimates were reasonably accurate; however, the ad(cid:173)ministration requested and the Congress passed a supplemental which prgved to be unnecessary. In the fiscal year 1974, for the first time the pendulum swung the other way and the estimates were vastly overstated. As a result, the administration recom(cid:173)mended a rescission, a significant one, better than three-quarters of a billion dollars; but we in the Congress re(cid:173)scinded $1,188 million. Mr. Chairman, I am concerned that in the fiscal year 1974 the rescission was too sharp. HEW has already had to bor(cid:173)row over $100 million from their fiscal year 1975 appropriation,. which is not accounted for in our committee esti(cid:173)mates. Second, the fiscal year 1974 estimates are based on the November 1973 State estimates, reduced by the administration by more than $500 million. The May 1974 State estimates are nearly $700 million higher than the State requests. If these State estimates are more cor(cid:173)rect than the House estimates, there could be a deficit of more than $1.5 bil(cid:173)lion. There is no certainty as to who is right about this thing. It is reasonably clear, however, that even if the trend is down, as it was in fiscal year 1974, our commit(cid:173)tee has cut too much. Members should assume that there is a due bill waiting in the wings in the form of a SUIPPlemen(cid:173)tal for public assistance which will al(cid:173)most certainly wipe out the margin shown in our committee report as being below the President's budget. That is the point I want to make, that we do not get carried away and think that we are in such good shape that when these amendments are offered-in one item to increase public service employ(cid:173)ment by $300 million-we take the opti(cid:173)mistic view that all is well, because it is not all well. It is pretty bad and we ought to face up to the music. The supplemental security income item, which shows an increase here of $2.6 billion over last year in the bill now to a brings that item up total of $4.8 billion. In this fiscal year we will have 5 mil(cid:173)lion beneficiaries of this particular pro(cid:173)gram. ",
            "954": "21656 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE June 27, 197 4 businessman to file an appeal on a cita(cid:173)tion and/or penalty. The law currentlY requires him to file such notice within 15 days after receipt of citation. Because of the limited access to engineering coun(cid:173)seling and legal advice in many areas of our country, on which a businessman might base a decision on whether or not to appeal a citation, I believe this time limit should be extended to 30 days. This extension would not adversely affect the concept of the law, but it would allow the businessman a little more time in which to make what could be a most important decision. I know that many of my colleagues are aware that there are areas in the law that require review and possible reform. The Select Labor Subcommittee over(cid:173)sight hearings on OSHA currently being conducted are a testimony to this recog(cid:173)nition of problem areas in the law. How(cid:173)ever, the reform efforts of this Congress must proceed at a pace that will satisfy the businessmen of this Nation that we are in earnest about seeking fair changes that will encourage voluntary compli(cid:173)ance. In my own congressional district, onsite consultation is viewed as a top priority in the small business sector. A recent questionnaire survey I conducted on OSHA indicated overwhelming sup(cid:173)port for the onsite consultation idea. This amendment does not eviscerate the law. It seeks to strengthen the law by encouraging a more favorable atti(cid:173)tude-a receptivity-in an economic sector that employs most of the workers covered under the law. We cannot ignore the rights of American workers for a safe and healthful working environment. But also, we cannot ignore the legitimate needs of the small businessmen of this Nation who support the concepts of the law but who are having trouble in under(cid:173)standing the exact application of the law to their individual businesses. These businessmen are not seeking to escape their responsibilities to their workers(cid:173)they are trying to find out exactly what these responsibilities are and how they can go about implementing safety and health programs. We need to meet small business halfway in this effort. Onsite consultation is one of the keys to greater understanding, and ultimatelY accept(cid:173)ance, of the needs to promote a safe and healthy work environment. I urge my colleagues to support this worthy and very much needed amend(cid:173)ment to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Mr. MAYNE. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Mrs. GREEN of Oregon. I yield to the gentleman from Iowa. Mr. MAYNE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the distinguished member of the House Se(cid:173)lect Subcommittee on Labor from Wis(cid:173)consin <Mr. STEIGER), and thank my good friend, the gentlewoman from Ore(cid:173)gon <Mrs. GREEN), for her generosity and graciousness in yielding me this time. In the last Congress, I appeared before the House Select Subcommittee on Labor in its oversight hearings with regard to the Occupational Safety and Health Act and its administration, and testified with regard to the folly of strict application of the act and the regulations which had promulgated to the small farmer and small business. Some of the regulations since have been modified, having been proved to be impractical if not ridiculous, but there is still further need for revi(cid:173)sion of the regulations toward more com(cid:173)monsense approaches. However, the greatest folly still re(cid:173)mains in the act and any strict applica(cid:173)tion of it-the fact that the law provides for mandatory fines and penalties upon the Occupational Safety and Health Ad(cid:173)ministration inspector first coming upon the jobsite and finding conditions which he determines are not in strict con(cid:173)formity with the prescribed standards. It is difficult enough for the giant cor(cid:173)poration to keep up with the many laws and regulations affecting its operations, including OSHA, but at least through its corporate network it has some chance of keeping informed and making the requi(cid:173)site modifications in its plants and work rules so as to be compatible with the latest rulings in Washington or the re(cid:173)gional OSHA office. But how is a small farmer or the entrepreneur of a small family business to keep track of these complex regulations and rulings? I must confess my amazement that farmers and independent businesses are able to keep up as well as they do with the myriad regulations affecting them, but surely it can be no real surprise to find that the \"word\" does not always get around, or that small store owner, the dirt farmer, the family doctor or corner druggist, or the owner-operator of the rural gasoline station may be somewhat confused on just how a complicated reg(cid:173)ulation designed for larger operations might be applied in his particular situ(cid:173)ation. These employers do not wish to main(cid:173)tain unsafe conditions, but they are often not really aware that their working con(cid:173)ditions might somehow be considered hazardous to the health and safety of their employees. Once they are apprised fully of where allegedly dangerous con(cid:173)ditions exist and how those conditions might be improved to meet the standards promulgated for their type of operation, I believe you will find most of these em(cid:173)ployers willing to do what they can to make the changes sought. But they have found they cannot under the law ask the Federal OSHA inspector to look over their plant or operation and advise them where they might be deficient so that they can com(cid:173)ply with the law and regulations, for it appears the law requires a mandatory fine to be imposed, as well as other action which often would impose hardship as well as inconvenience upon the employer, whenever an inspector determines that the site does not perfectly meet the uni(cid:173)form standards set in Washington. As I stated in the hearings in the last Congress, there is an urgent need to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act to permit employers to ask the OSHA inspector to come to the site and advise just where conditions are sub(cid:173)standard and how the employer might correct the conditions, without rwming the risk of being subjected to mandatory penalties on that first visit. Onsite con(cid:173)sultation should be expressly authorized for in the act and in the regulations. If, after having been informed that the worksite is unsafe or unhealthy, the employer does not make any good-faith effort to bring the worksite up to stand(cid:173)ard within a reasonable period of time, then imposition of sanctions might be considered in order to bring about com(cid:173)pliance-but not before then. The intent of the act after all was not to see how much could be collected in fines, or to harass employers and drive them out of business, but to obtain, basically through education and coopera(cid:173)tion, the improved conditions necessary to assure that employees are not unnec(cid:173)essarily subjected to hazards to health and safety which could have been avoided by use of reasonable care and precautions on the part of the employer. I have introduced or cosponsored legis(cid:173)lation in the last Congress and again in this Congress which would amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act to provide for onsite consultation and ad(cid:173)vice. It is ridiculous and intolerable for inspectors to be required to issue cita(cid:173)tions when violations are found on the first visit, especially for small firms and farmers which cannot afford to hire their own ORHA compliance specialists. I am grateful that the Select Subcom(cid:173)mittee on Labor has been holding over(cid:173)sight hearings this spring in which it has considered these and other amendments, but must regret that the subcommittee has not yet reported such urgently need(cid:173)ed amendments for early enactment. In the meantime, however, at least 21 States presently provide onsite consul(cid:173)tation as part of their OSHA-approved State plan. The amendment proposed by the Member from Wisconsin (Mr. STEIGER) would appropriate an addi(cid:173)tional $5 million to the OSHA for grants to States for the provision of onsite con(cid:173)sultative services to assist employers in meeting their OSHA requirements, thus providing incentive to the rest of the States to join in providing onsite con(cid:173)sultation as part of their respective State plans. There appears to be ample authority in sections 2Hc) and 7(c) (1) of the Oc(cid:173)cupational Safety and Health Act to carry out such a program through State plans. Until such time as we are able to achieve enactment of an amendment to the act specifically providing for onsite consultation, whether by Federal OSHA or State OSHA inspectors-an amend(cid:173)ment I would urge be given top priority by the leadership of the Education and Labor Committee and by the House leadershiP-the Steiger amendment to the present bill will provide urgently needed interim relief making it possible to \u00b7continue efforts to enhance safety in the workplace. I respectfully request all in this House to support this amendment. Mr. FINDLEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, this amendment ob(cid:173)viously is worth while. I think it is a good one. It is good because it recognizes the problem but, in my opinion, it does not solve the problem. \u2022. ",

Almost immediately, a treaty providing for American annexa(cid:173)tion was \"negotiated\" with the new gov(cid:173)ernment, but that treaty was withdrawn from Senate consideration by President Grover Cleveland just after he took of(cid:173)fice. President Cleveland then sent a spe(cid:173)cial envoy, the Honorable James H. Blount, to investigate the circumstances surrounding the so-called \"revolution\" which overthrew the monarchy, Mr. Blount, a longtime Georgia Congress(cid:173)man and former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, flatly con(cid:173)cluded that the revolution was the result of a conspiracy between the U.S. Minis(cid:173)ter to Hawaii and revolutionary non(cid:173)Hawaiian leaders in Hawaii. In an official communication to the Congress about the affair, President Cleveland himself stated that-But for the lawless occupation of Hono(cid:173)lulu under false pretenses by the United States Forces. . . . \u00b7 Hawaii would have remained a king(cid:173)dom under Queen Liliuokalani. The legislation which my colleague and I introduced today is to correct this historic wrongdoing. H.R. 15666 is the product of months and months of open, sometimes difficult efforts on the part of an organization known as Aboriginal Lands of Hawaiian Ancestry. The acronym for that name brings new meaning to the word \"ALOHA.\" From the crucible of hearings on the various islands in Hawaii, discussions within the organization's leadership and member(cid:173)ship, came legislation which would pro(cid:173)vide a degree of compensation to the descendants of the native Hawaiians for the lands of which they were deprived so long ago. The bill calls for the creation of an independent corporation to manage the amounts to be paid by the Federal Gov(cid:173)ernment, $100 million annually for 10 years for a total of $1 billion. There 1s also a provision giving the corporation first rights on any land in Hawaii de(cid:173)clared to be excess of its use by the Fed(cid:173)eral Government. It is unfortunate that there is no prac(cid:173)tical way, in effect, to return the land to the Hawaiians. The sad fact is that there are only about 6,000 square miles in the entire State of Hawaii, compared with about 570,000 square miles in Alaska. Thus, there can be no large-scale return of land in settlement of these claims, as there was in the case of the Alask\u00b7a Native Claims. In fact, the land returned to the Alaska Natives by itself is equal to about 10 times the total area of Hawaii. That is why the bill being introduced today fo(cid:173)cuses on money damages. Mr. Speaker, I well realize-and the Hawaiian people realize-that this legis(cid:173)lation will not be easy to enact. It in(cid:173)volves a large amount of money, and ts intended to redress a grievance which most Americans probably do not yet even know occurred. It is my hope, however, that the bill being introduced today will serve as a vehicle for discussion, a way to facts which more than justify this legis(cid:173)focus public attention on the historical lation. The members of ALOHA, and the members of the Hawaii congressional delegation, will be very active in educat(cid:173)ing all Americans to the justness of the cause represented by the bill. I trust that early hearings will be pos(cid:173)sible to further raise the public consci(cid:173)ousness on this matter. In this connection I wish to congra(cid:173)tulate Mr. Kekoa Kaapu, president of ALOHA Association, Mrs. Louisa Rice, its founder and director and members of the board of directors, who have been in Washington for nearly a week on a special mission which they have accom(cid:173)plished beyond all expectations.

(Mr. STEELMAN) is recognized for 5 min(cid:173)utes. Mr. STEELMAN. Mr. Speaker, quite possibly one of the most telling votes of the 93d Congress was cast yesterday when the Democrats withheld from the American people the opportunity for public debate and a vote on the Commit(cid:173)tee Reform Amendments of 1974. The vote to table the appeal of the Speaker's ruling against bringing the Committee Reform Resolution before the Rules Committee not only demonstrated the Democrat's opposition to reform but, even worse, their disregard for the pub(cid:173)lic's right to know. The very act of hiding reform of Con(cid:173)gress from the public and not allowing their representatives to publicly comment or vote on this proposal is the very rea(cid:173)son that the confidence of the public is reaching an all-time low. And what has been our response? While many felt forming a bipartisan Reform Committee was a sincere response to public concern with the legislative branch, the Demo(cid:173)cratic leadership's attempt to bury their very positive report-delivered after 14 months of extensive hearings and com(cid:173)promise-is evidence that this was obvi(cid:173)ously part of a charade. Apparently, the Democratic leadership is satisfied with the state of affairs in the House that has led to this level of public disdain. Mr. Speaker, once again ironclad party discipline, special interests, and power politics have denied the public the right to know and denied this House the op(cid:173)portunity to function effectively. As President John Kennedy said \"Some(cid:173)times party loyalty asks too much.\" This was definitely one of those times. It is most unfortunate that many Democrats ostensibly so committed to reform have blindly followed this path. Mr. Speaker, this is not only a ques(cid:173)tion of committee reform but of reform in general and openness in the legislative process. The day is long gone when the Congress can hide their activities in Washington from constituents. How much lower must the confidence level sink before there will be a response by the Democratic leadership. Apparently condemnation of their administration of the House by 80 percent of the citizenry is not enough. But, it is for me and every Member of this body who goes door to door listening to the concerns of their constituents. They want a change. They deserve a change. And no rationalization citing parliamentary procedure is going to fool them. They know what this vote meant. Mr. Speaker, the people deserve better. CRISIS IN THE AMERICAN DAffiY INDUSTRY-A CALL FOR ACTION The SPEAKER. Under a previous or(cid:173)der of the House, the gentleman from. ",
            "1104": "21806 cans are much less secure now than would have otherwise been the case. And to the extent we are less secure be(cid:173)cause of increasing Soviet military capa(cid:173)bilities it means that our own extensive expenditures for national defense may well have to reflect substantial compen(cid:173)satory increases in the years ahead. Thus not only have we provided the Soviet Union with the means to keep pace with us militarily and done so on credit pro(cid:173)vided at the expense of American con(cid:173)sumers and industry, but we then must allocate more of our taxpayers money for national defense in order to meet the new challenges of our adversaries. The time has obviously come to bring in a halt to this insane if not suicidal process. The House of Representatives has acted through the passage of the Trade Reform Act last December to cur(cid:173)tail the subsidization of the Soviet system as long as they remain a rigid totalitarian regime. It is now time for the adminis(cid:173)tration to recognize the clear wishes of the vast majority of the American people and bring to a halt the long series of dangerous concessionary agreements that have characterized our negotiations with the Soviet Union. Let us have genuinely mutual agreements limit the arms r9.ce, but we must terminate our well(cid:173)disguised foreign aid program to our principal adversary in the world today. to STREET LESSONS HON. HENRY HELSTOSKI OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 27, 1974 Mr. HELSTOSKI. Mr. Speaker, as a result of a variety of incidents over the past few years, many people unfortu(cid:173)nately have come to view policemen as unenlightened, uneducated, and insensi(cid:173)tive. However, as Dr. George L. Kirk(cid:173)ham, assistant professor of the School of Criminology of Florida State University recently found out, no point of view could be further from the truth. In an effort to see what life as a police(cid:173)man was really like, Dr. Kirkham joined the Jacksonville-Duval County, Fla., force, after an intense period of physical and academic training. Dr. Kirkham subsequently wrote: Night after night, I came home with a sense of satisfaction and contribution society that I have never known 1n any other job. to The story of George Kirkham is a powerful one. Not only is it the story of one man's prejudices, but it is an over(cid:173)powering tribute to the honesty, bravery, and perseverance which characterize the dally performance of thousands of police-men throughout the country. Mr. Speaker, an excellent article by Pr. Kirkham concerning his experience and entitled \"A Professor's 'Street Les(cid:173)sons'\" appeared recently in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin. An adapta(cid:173)tion of Dr. Kirkham's article was pub(cid:173)lished recently by the American Mercury magazine. Jn view of the fact that his EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS story is extremely moving and highly relevant to each of our constituencies, I would now like to take this opportunity to share this material with my col(cid:173)leagues: A PROFESSOR'S \"STREET LEssoNs\" (By Dr. George L. Kirkham) As policemen have come under increasing criticism in recent years, I cannot help but wonder how many times they have clenched their teeth and wished they could expose the critics to some of the harsh rea.Ut1es of police work. Members of the academic community, in(cid:173)cluding myself, a criminologist, have been quick to find fault with the police. We have fashioned a stereotype which ignores the good and focuses on the isolated and the bad: the brutal cop, the racist cop, the grafting cop, the discourteous cop. What we do not see, however, is the image of thousands of dedicated men and women struggling against almost impossible odds to preserve our society and everything in it which we cherish. For some time, first as a student and later as a professor, I found myself troubled by the fact that most of the critics haven't themselves been policemen. This was pointed up when some of my students-many of them former policemen-would respond to my fre(cid:173)quently critical lectures on the police with the argument that I could not possibly en(cid:173)dure what a police officer has to endure. I decided to take up this challenge and work as a policeman myself, as a means of establishing once and for all the accuracy of what I and other criminologists had been saying about the pollee all along. My plan-which meant becoming a full(cid:173)time policemen for four months in the sum(cid:173)mer, and a part-time one during the aca(cid:173)demic year when my teaching duties re(cid:173)sumed-not surprisingly brought skepticism from family, friends and colleagues. After all, at age 31 I had a family and an established career. A student recommended that I apply at the consolidated, 800-man force of Jacksonville(cid:173)Duva.l County, Florida, an especially pro(cid:173)gressive department. I followed up the idea, since Jacksonville, with half a million resi(cid:173)dents, impressed me as a city experiencing many of the major social problems .of our time: crime and delinquency, racial unrest, poverty, and mental illness. It is a diverse city, and one with a fairly typical inner-city slum area and black ghetto. It seemed a good place to experience the stresses and strains of today's city policeman. POLICE DEPARTMENT AGREES The leadership of the police department was receptive. I made it clear that I did not want to be merely an observer, but a. fully sworn, fulltime (although unpaid) member of the department for some months. I also said I wanted to spend most of this time working as a uniformed patrolman in those inner city beats most characterized by vio(cid:173)lence, poverty, social unrest and crime. They agreed to my plan, with the stipula(cid:173)tion that I would first have to meet all the requirements that any other police applicant would. They also stipulated, and agreed, that for the sake of morale 1n the depart(cid:173)ment, every officer must know tn advance who I was an4 what I was doing. The experlm.ent began with the required 280 hours or police academy training. For 4 months, 4 hours each evening, I attended the academy, along with 35 younger class(cid:173)mates. At first I stood out as a.n oddity ln the class, but with tlme I was accepted by the group. When graduation came, I was indistin(cid:173)guishable !rom other officers in every re(cid:173)spect, including my .88 revolver, badge and uniform. I June 28, 1974 I had always suspected that police officers greatly exaggerate the amount of verbal dis(cid:173)respect and physical abuse to which they are subjected in the line of duty. During my first few hours as a street officer, that bub(cid:173)ble was burst. As a college professor, I had grown accus(cid:173)tomed to being treated with respect. I some(cid:173)how assumed that this would carry over into my new role as a policeman. I was, after all, a. representative of the law, identifiable to all by the badge and uniform I wore as some(cid:173)one dedi ca. ted to the protection of society. Surely that would entitle me to a. measure of cooperation. I quickly found that my badge and uni(cid:173)form, rather than serving to shield me from such things as disrespect and violence, only acted as a magnet which drew me toward many individuals who hated what I repre(cid:173)sented. Several hours into my first evening on the streets, my partner and I were dispatched to a bar to handle a disturbance complaint. Inside, we encountered a large and boister(cid:173)ous drunk who was arguing with the bar(cid:173)tender and refusing to leave. As someone with considerable experience as a. correctional counselor and mental health worker, I hastened to take charge of the situation. \"Excuse me, Sir,\" I smiled pleas(cid:173)antly at the drunk, \"but I wonder if I could ask you to step outside and talk with me for just a minute?\" The man stared at me through bloodshot eyes in disbelief for a second, raising one hand to scratch the stub(cid:173)ble of several days growth of beard. Then suddenly, he swung at me, missing my face and striking me on the right shoulder. I couldn't believe it. What had I done to provoke such a. reaction? Before I could re(cid:173)cover from my startled condition, he swung again-this time tearing my whistle chain from a shoulder epaulet. After a brief struggle, we had the still shouting, cursing man locked in the back of our cruiser. I stood there, breathing heav(cid:173)ily with my hair in my eyes as I surveyed the damage to my new uniform and looked in bewilderment at my partner, who only smiled and clapped me affectionately on the back. \"Something is very wrong,\" remember thinking 1o myself in the front seat as we headed for jail. I had used the same kind of gentle, rapport-building approach with countless offenders in prison and probation settings. It had always worked so well there. What was so different about being a. police(cid:173)man? I ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCE In the days and weeks which followed, I was to learn the answer to this question the hard way. As a. professor, I had sought to convey to students the idea that it is a mistake to impose authority, to make deci(cid:173)sions for other people, or rely upon com(cid:173)mands to accomplish something. As a police officer myself, I was forced time and again to do just that. For the first time in my life, I encountered individuals who interpreted kindness as weakness, as an invitation to disrespect or violence. I encountered men, women, and children who, in fear, despera(cid:173)tion, or excitment, looked to the person be(cid:173)hind my uniform for guidance, control, and direction. As one who had always condemned the exercise of authority, the acceptance of myself as an unavoidable symbol of author(cid:173)ity came as a. bitter lesson. I found that there was a world of differ(cid:173)individuals 1:n ence between encountering mental health or correctional settings and facing them as the patrolman must-when they are violent, hysterical, desperate. When I put the uniform on, I lost the luxury of sitting in an office, calmly discussing with a rapist or armed robber the problems which had led him into trouble with the law. Such offenders had seemed so harmless in the ",
            "1154": "21856 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE July 1, 197 4 the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court transmitted to the Congress on April22, 1974. The Clerk read as follows: H.R. 15461 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of .RepTesentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That, not withstanding the provisions of sections 3771 and 3772 of title 18 of the United States Code, the effective date of the proposed amendments to the Federal Rules of Crim(cid:173)inal Procedure which are embraced by the order entered by the United States Supreme Court on April and which were transmitted to the Congress by the Chief Justice on April 22, 1974, is post(cid:173)poned until August 1, 1975. 22, 1974, The SPEAKER. Is a second demanded? Mr. SMITH of New York. Mr. Speaker, I demand a second. The SPEAKER. Without objection, a second will be considered as ordered. There was no objection. The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Missouri <Mr. HUNGATE), will be recog(cid:173)nized for 20 minutes, and the gentleman from New York <Mr. SMITH), will be rec(cid:173)ognized for 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes from Missouri. the gentleman GENERAL LEAVE Mr. HUNGATE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on this bill, H.R. 15461. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from\u00b7 Missouri? There was no objection. Mr. HUNGATE. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 15461, the bill now before the House, comes to the floor with the unanimous endorsement of the Committee on the Judiciary. This bill postpones the effec(cid:173)tive date of certain amendments to the Federal Ruies of Criminal Procedure from August 1, 1974, to August 1, 1975. The Federal Rules of Criminal Pro(cid:173)cedure, as the name suggests, are the ruies that govern Federal criminal trials. These rules apply not only to the trial itself, but they also apply to matters and procedures taking place before trial(cid:173)such as issuing an arrest warrant-and after trial--such as sentencing. There are presently 63 ruies. The procedure for amending the rules is set forth in sections 3771 and 3772, title 18 of the United States Code. Briefly, these statutes require that the Supreme Court report changes in the ruies to the Congress after the start of a reguiar session, but not later than May 1. Changes become effective 90 days later, all laws in conflict being of no further force or effect. Acting pursuant to this statutory au(cid:173)thority, the Supreme Court 'transmitted certain proposed amendments to Con(cid:173)gress on April 22, 1974. These proposed amendments will take effect Aug'USit 1, 1974, unless legislation to the contrary is enacted. The proposed amendments make changes in 10 existing rules and add 3 new rules. Thus, in quantitative terms, the Supreme Court proposes to change nearly 20 percent of the present ruies, a significant change. The proposed. amendments are signifi(cid:173)cant for another reason-they affect controversial areas of criminal law and procedure. All segments of the legal pro(cid:173)fession were invited to comment upon the proposed amendments-judges, pros(cid:173)ecutors, defense counsel, law professors, and professional organizations and agencies. The overwhelming majority of replies from these segments were critical of the proposed amendments and sug(cid:173)gested changes in them. Only four of the proposed amendments escaped criticism. Several organizations and individuals asked to be heard on the proposed amendments. It became quite apparent that 90 days was not enough time to do justice to what the Supreme Court had sent over. Some of the proposed amendments had been under consideration for over 4% years. What takes 4% years to write deserves more than 90 days to review. H.R. 15461, by delaying the effective date for 1 year, gives Congress ample addi(cid:173)tional time to study carefuily the pro(cid:173)posed amendments. The wisdom of post(cid:173)ponement has been supported by such \u00b7diverse groups as the Department of Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union. I urge a favorable vote on H.R. 15461. Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. HUNGATE. I would be glad to yield to the gentleman from Iowa. Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman does this mean a delay of justice? Mr. HUNGATE. I wouid respond to the gentleman from Iowa that what is jus(cid:173)tice is a question, as the gentleman knows, that frequently arises in the courts, and sometimes receives a s~tis\u00adfactory answer, because what is justice to one may not be justice to another. We are concerned here with ruies that have been in existence for some time, I will tell the gentleman from Iowa. With the number of people who have contacted us wishing to express their views and have a voice in this before it becomes effective, we think it only fair to give them a chance to be heard before the committee. Mr. GROSS. We are reminded so fre(cid:173)quently, as the gentleman well knows, on the House floor when the lawyers are working up some kind of legislation, of that old adage \"Justice delayed is jus(cid:173)tice denied.\" I just wonder if this in(cid:173)ability to absorb in the 90 days what has been recommended is delaying justice in any way, shape, or form? Mr. HUNGATE. I appreciate the gen(cid:173)tleman's concern. We are hopeful on the committee that this delay will affect jus(cid:173)tice as time affects good wine. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New York. Mr. Speaker, rise in support of H.R. 15461 and wish to fully associate myself with the re(cid:173)marks of the chairman of the Subcom(cid:173)mittee on Criminal Justice. I The proposed amendments, sent to us on April 22 by the Chief Justice, make significant changes in the Rules of Crim(cid:173)inal Procedur' Because of the impor(cid:173)tance of som\\.. of those changes, I be(cid:173)lieve that both Houses of Congress shouid have ample time to consider them. Al(cid:173)though I believe we should act promptly, a maximum 1-year delay in the operation of the automatic effective date, pursuant to sections 3771 and 3772 of title 18 of the United States Code, seems reason(cid:173)able. Attorney General Saxbe strongly rec(cid:173)ommends this 1-year delay in these amendments. In a letter of June 17, 1974, he informed the Judiciary Committee he was offering objection on behalf of 90 of the 94 U.S. attorneys. The Attorney General specifically objects to the amendments to rules 4 and 9 regarding arrest warrants, and rule 16 regarding discovery motions. These objections point up the fact that, while these amendments purportedly affect only \"rules of procedure,\" in fact they have significant effect on the operations of the offices of the U.S. Attorneys and the operations of all the Federal law en(cid:173)forcement agencies. The amendment proposed to ruie 16 for example wouid require that a Fed(cid:173)eral prosecutor, before a trial, make known to the defendant and his attor(cid:173)neys the names and addresses of all the witnessess whose testimony will be used in the upcoming trial. As the Attorney General points out, in the prosecution of members of organized crime, witnesses are sometimes in the protective custody of the United States. Is it wise to require the Justice Department to disclose where that witness is being hidden? Whether it is or not, is a question, along with other questions raised by these amendments, which can only be answered after careful and comprehen(cid:173)sive consideration by the Congress. As the committee report points out, these amendments to the Criminal Rules of Procedure have been under consider(cid:173)ation by the Judicial Conference for 4% years. I urge all my colleagues to sup(cid:173)port this bill which gives us a maximum of 1 year to consider these amendments. Mr. RODINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 15461, a bill to delay the effective date of certain amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Unless this bill is enacted, these amend(cid:173)ments, which were promuigated by the Supreme Court on April 22, 1974, will automatically go into effect next August. 1. H.R. 15461 will merely postpone their effective date for 1 year to August 1, 1975. This bill is bipartisan. It is sponsored by all nine members of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Criminal Justice. The bill comes to the floor fav(cid:173)orably endorsed by a unanimous Judi(cid:173)ciary Committee. Equally important, the goal of this bill is endorsed by diverse segments of the legal profession-for example, the Department of Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union.

The Associated Press ran a story on Peace of Mind on its national wire. Fourteen Governors have contacted the office of Governor Briscoe for infor(cid:173)mation on how their States could aid and publicize this program. The people of Peace of Mind saw first hand the tragedy of alienation between parents and chil(cid:173)dren and decided that if no one else would do something, they woUld. They did and they are providing a first class, much needed service to the Nation, paying for it through their own pocketbooks and their own State taxes. There is very little bureaucracy or for(cid:173)mal organization to Peace of Mind. Vol(cid:173)unteers work when they can and the phone bills are\u00b7 paid when they can be paid. But surely in this time when our citizens are questioning the institutions of government, lack of formal organiza(cid:173)tion or bureaucracy is not a sufficient reason to withhold a $100,000 grant for such a humane and deserving project. On the contrary, I hope you will agree with me that it is quite a good reason to approve a grant. Yet the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has just informed Governor Briscoe that the grant application to fund this program has been disapproved by the Office of Youth Development because the appli(cid:173)cation was not properly prepared and because it had not received adequate at(cid:173)tention from the public and because the program is not tied to any other official units of Government. I know over 2, 700 people in 47 States who would not think much of that conclusion and I can tell you that I do not either. I sincerely hope that if this legislation we are consider(cid:173)ing today is finally established and Health, Education, and Welfare is given authority to carry out its provision, those in charge will recognize initiative andre(cid:173)ward such a dedicated group of people with their support, both morally and financially. The volunteers of Operation Peace of Mind need money to pay their phone bills and we have turned them down be(cid:173)cause their application was not properly done. I recognize the need within a bu(cid:173)reaucracy for standardization, but I hope that humanity and human need still have a place within the same bureaucracy. I want to add my support to the measure we are considering today and at the same time I want to ask the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to re(cid:173)consider his decision to refuse funding to Operation Peace of Mind. It would reassure a lot of disappointed people that their government is aware and informed and human and it would also keep a great program in business. The CHAffiMAN.

Had we wished to we could have annihilated Russia.\" Instead we now sell her wheat, sub(cid:173)sidized by the American taxpayers. We did our best to defend a free people in South Korea and South Vietnam. As our present envoy to South Vietnam, Ambassador Graham A. Martin, said in a re(cid:173)cent interview: \"Many Americans have for(cid:173)gotten that our real emotional involvement in Indo-China affairs began in 1954, with a characteristic American humanitarian re(cid:173)sponse when we helped move almost a mil(cid:173)lion-mostly Catholic-VietnameEe from North to the South.

Our present commitment arises from an even more characteristic American trait(cid:173)our determination and pride that we finish what we set out to do. And in this case, it is to leave Vietnam economically viable, mili(cid:173)tarily capable of defending itself with its own manpower, and its people free to choose their own government and their own lead(cid:173)ers.

Germany and Japan, and to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy, were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other blilions of debts ....

Let us pray for our leaders in the present difficulties and thank God from the bottom of our hearts that you and I enjoy independence not only on July 4th, but on every day of the year. If it were not for that you could not have written your letter. FRENCH NUCLEAR AID TO IRAN HON. BILL GUNTER OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, July 1, 1974 Mr. GUNTER. Mr. Speaker, last week I issued a statement expressing my con(cid:173)cern over the proposed United States(cid:173)Egyptian nuclear cooperation agreement promised by the President and my fears that this agreement would open the door for nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. I was troubled to learn some days ago that my fears were justified and that France has just concluded a trade agree(cid:173)ment with Iran that includes provisions for the latter's purchase of five nuclear reactors. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS This agreement follows hard on the heels of a statement by the Shah indi(cid:173)cating that Iran is about to embark upon a program for the development of nu(cid:173)clear weapons. When asked during a re(cid:173)cent interview with a French news mag(cid:173)azine whether he thought that Iran would someday possess nuclear weapons, the Washington Post, June 24, 1974, re(cid:173)ports the Shah's reply as: Without any doubt, and sooner than one would think. Now, despite the avowed intention of the Shah to go ahead with an atomic weapons program, France is going to sell Iran nuclear reactors which will have the capacity to produce more than enough plutonium than is necessary for an atomic bomb. Plutonium, which is a by(cid:173)product of the reactor's fission reaction, is the basic building block of the atomic bomb, without which the technical prob(cid:173)lems in nuclear weapons construction are almost insurmountable for most nations. Without strict safeguards, it is possible for any country, like India, to divert suf(cid:173)ficient quantities of plutonium for con(cid:173)struction of an atomic device. Yet the Washington Post, June 6, 1974, reports that past French reactor sales have not had inspection safeguards which would prevent diversion of plu(cid:173)tonium. Furthermore, France is not even a signatory of the nuclear nonprolifera(cid:173)tion treaty. Mr. Speaker, we must all be gravely concerned about the spread of nuclear weapons and their horrible potential for destruction. With President Nixon's re(cid:173)cent promise of nuclear cooperation with Egypt, we are on the verge of opening the door to the spread of nuclear tech(cid:173)nology throughout the area. France has not been hesitant in following our lead and offering her atomic expertise to Iran. Other countries, like the Soviet Union, may soon follow suit and provide their client states with high-prestige and even higher risk nuclear facilities. This new form of competition between the powers-currying favor with oil(cid:173)producing nations by selling them nu(cid:173)clear capability-must be stopped before it escalates into a grim new version of the arms race. The only way to stop this spiral is by seeing that the atom is kept out of the area. I commend the following article to my colleagues and other readers of the RECORD who are concerned about the dangers of nuclear proliferation: [From the Washington Post, June 27, 1974] FRANCE GETS $4 BILLION IN IRAN TRADE PARIS, June 27.-France achieved an eco(cid:173)nomic coup today in completing a long-term trading agreement with Iran valued at over $4 billion. Iran is to deposit $1 billion with the Bank of France as advance payment for major in(cid:173)dustrial projects--including five nuclear power stations and technological assistance(cid:173)to cost between $4 and $5 billion over 10 years. The shah of Iran and President Valery Gis(cid:173)card d'Estaing, after three days of talks, set the seal on the biggest-ever economic agree(cid:173)ment between an oil-producing country and a European industrialized power. Shah Mohamed Raza Pahlnui told a press conference: \"We are prepared to join with France in July 1, 197 4 building a petrochemical industry and go all the way in handling oil-from the well to the gasoline pump,\" he said. He added that there was an immense field of cooperation between Iran and France to be explored and developed. The French and Iranian finance ministers signed a detailed agreement for the construc(cid:173)tion of five nuclear power plants in Iran. French Finance Minister Jean-Pierre Four(cid:173)cade said payments by Iran would be made in installments over three years, starting later this year. After the initial deposit of $1 bil(cid:173)lion, the first payment would probably be about 300 million dollars. The deal will help France out of its balance of payments deficit, expected this year to be more than $6 billion. In addition to building the nuclear power plants, the French will supply uranium, in(cid:173)dustrial equipment and gas pipelines, Four(cid:173)cade said. The power plants, each of 1,000 megawatt capacity, are to be completed by 1985. . France will also assist in the creation of a nuclear research center in Iran and the train(cid:173)ing of nuclear scientists. [Past French reactor sales have not car(cid:173)ried requirements for inspections that would preclude use of the fuel for bombs.) Asked about the question of nuclear weap(cid:173)ons, the shah replied: \"For a long time, more than five years now, we have declared that we would be ready to turn our area into a non-nuclear zone-that is, an area where no nuclear weapons should be used or stored, and we stick to this policy.\" He denied having granted an interview to a French magazine which quoted him as say(cid:173)ing that Iran would possess atomic weaoons \"sooner than the world thinks.\" \u00b7 He said he had told a group of French journailsts in Tehran before coming to France that if every little country tried to get atomic weapons \"we will have to think it over-but I hope this will never happen.\" The shah also said today that \"all oil com(cid:173)panies should be nationalized.\" Explaining the French deal, he declared. \"When we were in a weak position and asked Europe for aid, we received it. If now the European countries have some difficulties with their balance of payments it is only natural for Iran, which has achieved a strong position to do what it can.\" THE 18TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE POZNAN WORKERS REVOLT HON. JOHN J. ROONEY OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, July 1, 1974 Mr. ROONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, in the present reported warm(cid:173)ing of the international environment that exists between the United States and the Soviet Union it is, I feel, wise to maintain the point of view that the Soviet Union is still a totalitarian state with a vast system of slave colonies in Eastern Europe. In this vast empire ex(cid:173)ists millions upon millions of people who still yearn fo\u00b7r freedom and who are will(cid:173)ing to bat,tle their oppressive Red Com(cid:173)munist governments to get it. Among these heroic peoples of East(cid:173)ern Europe, a special place belongs to the workers of Poznan, Poland, who on June 28, 1956, revolted puppet atheistic Communist masters in a bold attempt for freedom and self-de(cid:173)termination.

Rev. Ralph E. Haugh has only been at Pender for a short period of time, coming to us from the Highland Park United Methodist Church in Richmond. He was born in Maryland, grew up in Pennsylvania but came to Virginia in 1939 to attend Randolph Macon Men's College at Ashland, Va., and has re(cid:173)mained in our State since that time. After graduating from Randolph Macon, he took his theological training at Emory University in Atlanta, Ga.,and has been a minister since 1946, a period of 28 years. We at Pender Church hope that Rev.

I believe that Vice President GERALD FORD is SUCh a man. But what is the best way to achieve such a goal? I think that the country must experience a national reconcilia(cid:173)tion. And I believe this concurrent resol(cid:173)ution will help us achieve such a recon(cid:173)ciliation. The concurrent resolution would make it the sense of Congress that if President Richard M.

This concurrent resolution would have no legal or binding effect. It would be an advisory opinion issued by the Con(cid:173)gress of the United States. It would be an expression of Congress on how we, as a nation, should proceed in the event of a Presidential resignation. Some will argue that such a congres(cid:173)sional action is unjustified.

REP.

However, the fundamental reason why the indemnity is necessary is that there is not yet enough experience on which to base a firm judgment on the likelihood of the indemnity ever being utilized. Expert opinion holds this indemnity almost certainly will never be utilized. If this opinion eventually is proven correct, then there surely is no Government subsidy involved here, and in fact power reactor operators have been paying for pro(cid:173)tection above that which is necessary.\" H.R. REP. No. 883, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1965). 115 The relationship between the liability mechanism and insurance protection, on the one hand, and the rate of technological ad(cid:173)vance, on the other, has apparently not been the subject of serious study by economists. See G. FmLDS, THE INFLUENCE OF INSURANCE ON TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ( 1969) (George Washington University Program of Policy Studies in Science and Technology, Staff Discussion Paper 405) . The lack of in(cid:173)terest in this subject probably reflects the apparent uniqueness of nuclear power tech(cid:173)nology (within the private enterprise sec(cid:173)tor), which has produced an overnight quantum jump in potential liab111ty in an area in which relatively little risk experi(cid:173)ence is available. 11e In a recent nuclear power licensing pro(cid:173)ceeding before the AEC, the parties entered into a stipulation which shows that Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company will pay an annual premium of 250,000 dollars for its 95 million dollar public liability insurance and an annual fee of 73,500 dollars for its 465 million dollar AEC indemnity contract.

Although he seems to recognize that \"at least a fraction of the vast social costs of a nuclear incident\" is internalized by Price-Anderson, he does not discern that this fraction is so small that the element of therapeutic deterrence is almost wholly eliminated, a fact that is obvious since the net effect of Price-Anderson is to encourage (if not subsidize) nuclear power rather than to deter it.

STATEMENT BY SENATOR MONDALE I am pleased to co-sponsor the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. NELSON), and to urge its adoption. This issue facing us today-nuclear power plant safety-is of enormous importance to the future welfare of tens of millions of Americans, and to the future of our national energy policy. The nuclear power generating capacity of this country is on the verge of explosive growth, much O\u00b7f which will occur in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Although today nuclear reactors provide only about 6% of the nation's electricity, the Atomic Energy Commission projects that, if cur(cid:173)rent plans and projections are met, this figure wm rise to about 20% by 1980 and about 60% by the year 2000. Put in a different perspective, there are now about 42 nuclear reactors operating in the United States, currently producing elec(cid:173)tricity for the nation. By the mid-1980's, if current projections are met, it is likely that the AEC will be processing each year about as many applications as the entire current nuclear generating capacity in the United States at the present time. In this context, the Price-Anderson Act is of central importance. Orig~nally enacted in 1957, the Act would be modified and ex(cid:173)tended, under the committee-reported bill, for ten additional years, until August 1, 1987. The committee bill would leave in place the present $560 million limit on liability set by the original Price-Anderson Act, subject to a gradual increase\u00b7 in that limit, and a gradual phasing out of formal governmental indemnity as the number of nuclear reactors in operation increases. I believe that while, as a general approach, the committee bill is preferB.ible to the pres(cid:173)ent Price-Anderson Act, there is now no pressing need to extend the act for as long a period as the committee has recommended. Indeed, I believe that there are compe111ng considerations for a shorter extension, which will be of no harm to the planning of the nuclear power industry wh1le at the same time allowing the Congress to evaluate both our long-term national energy policy and a long-awaited study on nuclear reactor safety. The two-year extension and modUlcat\\.on of Price-Anderson as proposed in the amend(cid:173)ment by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Nelson), w111 protect the le(cid:173)gitimate interests of the nuclear power in(cid:173)dustry and will not cause disruptions in the planning of nuclear fac111ties. Proof of this is ava1lable from the statements of the pro(cid:173)ponents of the ten-year extension. For example, Congressman Melvin Price, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, in the Congressional Record of June 13, stated that: \"There is a common misconception that since the Price-Anderson Act will not expire until 1977, there is no need for immediate action. This is not the case. Since the lead(cid:173)times for construction permits for nuclear powerplants range from 2 to 4 years, de(cid:173)pending on a number of factors, uncertainty on extension of the Price-Anderson Act un(cid:173)til mid-1975 could create a significant dis(cid:173)rupti>on in ut111ty planning.\" And the Joint Committee, in its report on this legislation stated that: The Price-Anderson Act applies only to licenses issued prior to August, 1977. Nu(cid:173)clear power plants now in the planning and design phases would not receive construc(cid:173)tion permits until about 1977-1978. Thus there is uncertainty as to whether these plants would receive protection in the form of Government indemnity. Reactor manu(cid:173)facturers and architect-engineers are already requiring escape clauses in their contracts to permit cancellation in the event some form of protection from unlimited potential lia(cid:173)bility is not provided. Action is required soon to prevent disruption in ut111ty plans for nuclear power. In other words, proponents of this meas(cid:173)ure argue that there is a maximum four(cid:173)year lead time before the granting of a con(cid:173)struction permit for a nuclear power plant fac111ty, at which time the protection of the Price-Anderson Act becomes operative. They further argue that we in the Congress must provide this four year lead-time in order not to impair the orderly growth of the nuclear power industry. The amendment of the Senator from Wis(cid:173)consin (Mr. Nelson) would do precisely that. By extending the Act until August 1, 1979, the amendment would allow us to further examine the implications of the Price-An(cid:173)derson Act next year, both in the light of our developing national energy policy, and the conclusions of the so-called Reactor Safety Study, which will shortly be issued in draft form. and which shoUld shed new light on the safety of nuclear power plant faclli(cid:173)ties. The Congress could then make a con(cid:173)sidered judgment by mid-1975 on the form and length of any long-term extension of the Act as might be required. In the interim, the nuclear power industry would be able to continue its planning unhampered, safe in the knowledge that the Act will continue until mid-1979, or more than the four year lead time which the proponents of this meas(cid:173)ure claim ts necessary.

Chisholm Davis, Ga. Diggs Gray to committee amendment was So the agreed to. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, first I would like compliment the chairmen and the com(cid:173)mittee on the fine job they have done on this difficult legislation. I take this time to ask the chairman of the committee to clarify a matter that has to do with possible conflict between two sections of the bill. On page 7 of the bill there is a provision that limits a candidate and members of his immediate family to an expenditure of $25,000, and immediate family is defined in the law to include spouse, brother, sister, child, parent, and so forth; however, in the sec(cid:173)tion we have been talking about earlier, on page 2 of the bill we have a limit on contributions to $1,000. Is it the chairman's intention that the limit on the candidate's family expendi(cid:173)ture of $25,000 is the controlling section as far as members of a candidate's imme(cid:173)diate family are concerned? Mr. HAYS. That is the intent. That is the controlling section, and if the mem(cid:173)bers of the immediate family pool their resources to give $25,000, that is it. But, it does not say that any one of them can give, if there were five in a family, one can give and the others are limited to $1,000 apiece. It is a pooling affair. Mr. BINGHAM. man. $21,000 I thank the chair-The CHAIRMAN. Are there additional eligible amendments to title II? Are there committee amendments to title III? Are there eligible amendments to title IV? COMMITTEE AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. HAYS Mr. HAYS Mr. Chairman, I offer a committee amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Committee amendment offered by Mr. HAYs: Page 79, line 14, Insert \"(1)\" im(cid:173)mediately after \"(b) \". Page 79, line 15, strike out \"407,\". Page 79, immediately after line 16, insert the following: (2) The amendment made by section 407 shall apply with respect to taxable years beginning after December 81, 1971. Mr. HAYS. Mr. Chairman, this is a clarifying amendment to an amendment we had in the bill on the tax return, where there is no income. All this does is make it apply to any taxable year after the calendar year 1971, which is this tax(cid:173)able year. Therefore, it is just to wipe out the slate totally which we intended to wipe out. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the committee amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio <Mr. HAYS). The committee amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. FRENZEL Mr. FRENZEL. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. FRENZEL: Page 53, strike line 17 and all that follows down through page 61, line 4. Page 61, line 6, strike out \"407\" and insert in lieu thereof \"406\". Page 61, line 15, strike out \"408\" and insert in lieu thereof \"407\".

Page 79, line 15, strike out \"408, and 409\" and insert in lieu thereof \"and 408\". Mr. FRENZEL (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with and that it be printed in the RECORD. The CHAffiMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Min(cid:173)nesota? There was no objection. Mr. FRENZEL. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is very simple in intent. It strikes from the bill the provision that provides for Federal financing of na(cid:173)tional party nominating conventions. The bill, as it is before us, provides that the party conventions will be financed out of the public Treasury in the amount of $2 million for each of the major par(cid:173)ties. In addition, it provides that either party may spend in excess of the $2 mil(cid:173)lion which they receive from the tax(cid:173)payers' funds. Mr. Chairman, it is my strongly held belief that the Federal Government has no business controlling national party nominating conventions; that it should neither tell the parties of this country how much they can spend, nor should it give them any amount of money to spend. Financing can only lead to con(cid:173)trol, and we do not need Government control 9f either of our two fine parties. Mr. Chairman, this is a fundamental philosophical point. The parties belong to the people. The parties have been free of the Government. Here, unless we adopt my amendment, we are now at(cid:173)taching them to the bureaucracy. vve would be making them a part of the offi(cid:173)cial Government establishment. VVe would be, in fact, nationalizing the political parties of this great coun(cid:173)try. Therefore, I believe that it is abso(cid:173)lutely essential that this portion be stricken from the bill. I hope the Committee will support my amendment, Mr. Chairman. Mr. BRADEMAS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman, we all now know that Presidential nominating conventions, even as our Presidential primary elec-\u00b7 tions, are an essential part of the process of electing an American President, as im(cid:173)portant in their own way as is the gen(cid:173)eral election in the fall. I would point out, in urging rejection of this amendment, that we already have public financing of national Presidential nominating conventions in this country because most of the money that finances these conventions comes from tax deduc(cid:173)tions for advertising, deductions that are taken by various business and labor groups for advertisements published in the convention programs that are dis(cid:173)tributed at the convention. So the pres(cid:173)ent system is one whereby all of the tax(cid:173)payers in the country involuntarily pay, through the tax deduction route, for the holding of conventions. However, under the language in the committee bill, only those taxpayers who voluntarily participate in the dollar check-off participate in supporting the public financing of our two national nominating conventions. A second point I would like to make, Mr. Chairman, is that the provision in the committee bill for the public financ(cid:173)ing of Presidential nominating conven(cid:173)tions is the recommendation of the Bi(cid:173)partisan Commission on Convention Fi(cid:173)nancing. This is not a partisan matter. The third point I would like to make, Mr. Chairmar~, is that utilization of pub(cid:173)lic financing is voluntary on the part of the political parties. A political party is not mandated to receive public funds from the dollar check-off system, and if it does not wish to do so, it can use up to $2 million in private funds to finance its convention. Mr. Chairm&.n, it seems to me that if we retain the language in the committee bill, both with respect to Presidential nominating conventions and Presiden(cid:173)tial primaries, we shall be filling out the initiative that Congress undertook in 1972 in providing that, beginning in 1976, we shall have public financing of Presi(cid:173)dential general elections. Surely, the events which are plaguing and afflicting all of the people of the United States now, Democrats and Re(cid:173)publicans and Independents, in respect of the events associated with the 1972 ",

When Senator Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) introduced his bill, S. 3079, in favor of restoration of November 11th, he said: \"The meaning of November 11 has been engrained in the American spirit as a time of rededication to the principles of freedom and peace. More than any other group, our veterans should be honored in the year of our Bicentennial. As the Bicentennial serves to remind us of America's rich heritage, November 11 symbolizes America's tribute to all men who have served and fought to preserve that heritage. It will be a fitting tribute to America's \\eterans if we accom(cid:173)plish the restoration of November 11 as \"National Veterans' Day\" in time to correct the historicz.l record before we begin the Bicentennial celebration. \"Mr. Chairman, I respectfully urge the S'.lbcommittee to act favorably on S. 3079, and thereby return to the American vet(cid:173)eran the traditional day of National honor, and to the American people a Nati .. na: symbol of our dedication to tbe cause of freedom. Such a course of action will meet with wide(cid:173)spread approval of the Americd-n veteran and the American people.\" Since many veterans have evolved since, and before the original, November 11th date was designated it behooves all veterans' organizations to work to have Veterans Day reinstated on November 11 now, for if more time passes, there may not be many who will know the history of the importance of that date-the sacrifices made-the lives lost-tbe tragedies of a war. November 11, Veterans Day, a date that has grown to symbolize the ending, regardless of the date, of all wars in which our country has engaged in. National Junior Vice Commander. Lours F. ZARUBA, NFB AND THE NAC HON. EARL F. LANDGREBE OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, August 8, 1974 Mr. LANDGREBE. Mr. Speaker, next Monday, August 12, there will be a meet(cid:173)ing between representatives of the Na(cid:173)tional Federation of the Blind, an or(cid:173)ganization of 50,000 blind persons, and the National Accreditation Council, a body which receives money from the Federal Government for the purpose of accrediting sheltered workshops for the blind. The NFB has been trying to arrange such a meeting for months, and finally they have succeeded. I would like to include in the RECORD at this point an essay documenting some of the abuses that the NFB has been maintaining the NAC is guilty of: NAC UNMASKED--THE KE>TTNER CASE (By Joyce Hoffa) It is not surprising that the Minneapolis Society for the Blind is accredited by NAC. As a matter of fact, the Society's disgraceful behavior in the Kettner Case merely bears out the Federation's contention that the agencies NAC accredits are among the worst of the lot. NAC would like the world to believe that its standards have some relevance to the nature of programs for the blind. To hear NAC tell it, one would assume that attain(cid:173)ment of accreditation means something(cid:173)that accreditation provides assurance to the EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS is blind and to the public at large that the agency in question operates a quality \"pro(cid:173)fessional\" program-that its entire perform(cid:173)ance has been carefully scrutinized by the best available exoerts in the field and has presumably measured up. How then, does one resolve such a clear disparity between the virtuous characteris(cid:173)tics NAC alleges can be expected of an agency which has won its coveted accreditation and the despicable behavior exhibited by the Minneapolis Society. For we are not here dealing with matters of opinion, or philos(cid:173)ophy, or procedure, or semantics, or differing constituencies, or too small a meeting room, or any of the 101 other considerations by which NAC customarily weasels away from the issues. The Kettner travesty did occur. The documentation does exist. The Minne(cid:173)apolis Society is accredited. The Society did knowingly and intentionally play fast and loose with minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Society did certify Kettner as incapable of standard competitive productivity. Kettner competitively productive. Do NAC standards really condone such behav(cid:173)ior? Do they prohibit it? Do they say nothing about it? Or are the standards themselves merely window dressing on the whole facade -with accredition having nothing really at all to do with the kind of service an agency gives-being instead a function of money, power, and prestige? Or did NAC simply make a colossal mistake in accrediting the Society? Were its \"experts\" incapable of analyzing productivity records? Or did they not dig deep enough-looking only at those things Society officials wanted to show them? Did they not bother to talk to workers in the shop? Or did they talk only with those hand(cid:173)picked workers brought to them by Society officials? Or perhaps were Society officials designated to be on the on-site visit teams slated to review the \"experts'\" agencies? If so, now that it knows the facts, will NAC Withdraw its accreditation? Or Will NAC re(cid:173)fuse to acknowledge that Kettner occurred? Let us examine NAC's position for surely even NAC cannot stand idly by in this case. NAC's standards regarding minimum wage payments in sheltered workshops are woe(cid:173)fully inadequate. Paltry as they are, the Min(cid:173)neapolis Society fails to meet them. NAC begins by defining a sheltered workshop as \"a non-profit organization, public or volun(cid:173)tary, operated for the purposes of providing work training and employment to blind per(cid:173)sons who are unable to meet the require(cid:173)ments of regular competitive employment, or for whom such employment is not avail(cid:173)able.\" (As a sidelight, notice the use of the word \"voluntary.\" Presumably this is meant tore(cid:173)fer to shops which are more commonly re(cid:173)ferred to as \"private.\" \"Public,\" one can understand, but \"private'' [rightly or wrongly) carries a connota-tion of for the benefit of someone or something other than public. Hence NAC's euphemistic skill comes to the fore, and we have the substitution of \"voluntary\" shop for \"private\" shop.) NAC's definition employs the field's stand(cid:173)ard rhetoric. Shops are designed for those who are \"unable to meet the requirements of regular competitive employment.\" If NAC had stopped there, one could have only minimal quarrel with its definition of the purpose of the sheltered shop. But NAC also envisions the sheltered shop as a fitting place for the blind person who is competitively employable, but for whom \"such employ(cid:173)ment is not available.\" One cannot help but wonder if \"such employment is not avail(cid:173)able\" because as in Kettner's case and in the Sterner Company's words, \"no one ever asked before.\" _No, NAC's definition of the sheltered shop makes it far too easy for the lazy agency to August 8, 197 4 2.10: use the shop as a convenient dumping ground. After all, a status twenty-six closure (federal rehab jargon) is a status twenty(cid:173)six-that is, the state rehabilitation agency gets the same federal credit (\"status twenty(cid:173)six: closed employed\") for a pla.cement in the sheltered shop as for the best imaginable job in private industry. The state agency gets credit; the federal statistics get credit; the sheltered shop gets credit; and only the blind worker gets shortchanged and left out in the cold-often at less than the minimum wage. NAC officials would like to have it gen(cid:173)erally believed that NAC standards require sheltered shops to pay the federal minimum wage. Indeed, on numerous occasions their public statements have attempted to leave this implication: Direct question to Alexander Handel on the floor of the 1971 National Federation of the Blind Convention: \"There is no require(cid:173)ment of NAC standards, is there Mr. Handel, that you have to have minimum wage?\" Mr. HANDEL. \"You have to conform to the Federal Minimum Wage and Hour Law.\" Question. \"Are you saying that NAC will not accredit or will withdraw accreditation from any sheltered workshop which doesn't pay its blind workers a minimum wage?\" Mr. HANDEL. \"You didn't understand me correctly. I said that the standards do call for conformance with the wage and hour law.\" Former NAC President, Peter Salmon, also found it distasteful to admit that NAC does not require minimum wage payment. His evasion technique was to quote out of con(cid:173)text the Comstac Report, page 296, standard \"The workshop pays wage rates com(cid:173)mensurate with those paid for similar types and amounts of work by local commercial and industrial establishments maintaining approved labor standards.\" He naturally omitted any reference to standard 2.9.1 which makes it clear that pay(cid:173)ment of wages below the minimum wage is specifically approved: \"Where applicable, the workshop has certificates, from the Wage and Hours Division, U.S. Department of Labor, and from the appropriate state agency au(cid:173)thorizing client wages less than the statutory minimum.\" In other words, when the whole of what NAC says about workshop wages is examined in context, it is seen that NAC does not pro(cid:173)hibit payment of subminimum wages. It merely requires a certain amount of paper work before subminimum payment is al(cid:173)lowed. To NAC's credit, however, it must be point(cid:173)ed out that standards 2.10 through 2.10.6 at least attempt (if somewhat vaguely) to re(cid:173)quire the shop to make an honest, good faith effort to determine the worker's productivity in comparison to similar types of work per(cid:173)formed in non-sheltered situations. In view of NAC's dubious ethical behavior in so many instances and in view of the Widespread re(cid:173)ports of workshop abuse of wage rate ex(cid:173)emption procedures, the question must be raised as to whether standards 2.10 through their application deal so inade(cid:173)quately with the problem because of sheer ineptness on the part of tbe standard writers and appliers or whether there was, indeed, a conscious attempt to leave l'Jopholes. In any case, the Minneapulis Society's be(cid:173)havior is in cl~ar violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and in violation of NAC's public statements that it requires adherence to the provisions of that Act. NAC has re(cid:173)peatedly asked for documentation of com(cid:173)plaints against its \u00b7procedures and against its accredited agencies. It has chosen to ignore voluminous documentation presented it. Naturally NAC does not admit that it ignores such documentation. Rather, it uses the curious device of redefining the word \"docu(cid:173)mentation\" to meet its own narrow specifica(cid:173)tions. Here, however, is documentation that N.AC must face. It cannot redefine Lawrence 2.10.6 and ",
            "304": "27624 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE August 9, 197 4 State University, University of Missouri, and University of Nebraska) UNIVERSITY OF MID-AMERICA To BRING NEW OFF-CAMPUS PROGRAMS TO THE MmWEST KANSAS CITY, Mo.-Five midwestern state universities announced here Monday that they will cooperate to develop a new re(cid:173)gional educational institution to be known as the University of Mid-America. At an afternoon news conference, chief executives of the University of Missouri, the University of Kansas, Kansas State Univer(cid:173)sity, Iowa State University and the Univer(cid:173)sity of Nebraska announced that the Uni\u00b7 versity of Mid-America (UMA) would be(cid:173)come a new regional \"open learning\" uni(cid:173)versity which makes college-level courses a vallable to people in their homes. UMA, which will be managed as a joint project by the five-university consortium, Will coordinate development of open learn(cid:173)ing educational systems in the Midwest, while it designs and produces multimedia courses that will be available for use in the region and around the nation. The five university presidents will serve as members of the UMA Board of Trustees, the chief policy-making body, while other policy guidance wm be provided by an Academic Council of five faculty members from each participating university and a National Council of Advisors of laymen and educators from the Midwest region and the nation. UMA was formally incorporated under the laws of Nebraska last Friday in Lincoln, Nebraska. At an organizational meeting Monday, the trustees elected James McCain, president of Kansas State University, as chairman of the board and named C. Brice Ratchford, presi(cid:173)dent of the University of Missouri, as vice chairman. D. B. Varner, president of the University of Nebraska, was elected president of UMA, and Jack McBride, executive director of the Uni(cid:173)versity of Nebraska's S-U-N (State University of Nebraska) Project, was elected UMA ex(cid:173)ecutive vice president. Ronald J. Turner was elected secretary and William H. Eberle treasurer. At S-U-N, Turner is the assistant to the director and Eberle is director of busi(cid:173)ness and finance. McCain, speaking for the UMA Board of Trustees, said that in the S-U-N Project the University of Nebraska has established a pro(cid:173)gram of potential national significance in \"open learning,\" the descriptive phrase for new efforts to provide college-level educa(cid:173)tional opportunities to people in their homes. McCain said all the communications media, including television, radio, telephone systems and eventually perhaps computers and satel(cid:173)lites, wm be combined by UMA with print materials and audio tape cassettes as part of packaged courses. s-U-N's open learning research efforts over the past months have been funded by the National Institute of Education (NIE), the new research arm of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. This fall, S-U-N with UMA support Will return to NIE, seeking multiple year funding on behalf of the unique regional university. Ratchford said that in the initial phases of UMA development, courses will be produced for UMA through a subcontract relationship with the University of Nebraska and S-U-N, while the several universities provide leader(cid:173)ship for development of delivery systems Which can provide postsecondary learning opportlinities from border to border in each state. Varner, whose leadership was instrumental in creation of UMA, said he believed the five state universities were creating a unique new institution in American postsecondary edu(cid:173)cation. Leadership for UMA development, he noted, will be a joint enterprise by the faculty and staffs of the several institutions involved. \"The creation of UMA marks an important first in cooperative rf:gional educational en(cid:173)deavors,\" said Varner. \"I believe it may lead to other successful ventures in sharing of resources and expertise across state bound(cid:173)aries.\" All five institutions are members of the Mid-America State Universities Association (MASUA), a regional association of the five schools and the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University. McCain said the MASUA schools had pro(cid:173)vided the leadership for UMA planning dur(cid:173)ing the past several months. As a next stage of development, he said, the MASUA schools will act as catalysts to develop plans for de(cid:173)livery systems involving all segments of post(cid:173)secondary education in each state. \"This is a significant date in the history of higher education in the Midwest and in the nation,\" said McCain. \"We see this project as a way to expand the important resources of the MASUA universities to serve people froll}. all walks of life and at all ages.\" Also attending the news conference were Chancellor Archie Dykes of the University of Kansas and Assistant Vice President Edwin c. Lewis of Iowa State University, who at(cid:173)tended on behalf of Iowa State President w. Robert Parks. UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA, Lincoln, Nebr., July 22, 1974. Senator ROMAN HRUSKA, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.O. DEAR SENATOR HRUSKA: We were delighted to have the opportunity to visit with you on July 5th and brief you on the S-U-N project. There continues to be every evidence and this model regional open learning develop(cid:173)ment is potentially highly significant to higher education in the Midwest \u2022 and, in(cid:173)deed, nationally. The $2 million the Office of Education, the National Institute of Edu(cid:173)cation and private foundations have pro(cid:173)vided these past three and a half years has enabled this new educational concept to be extensively researched and developed. With operations planned to begin next January, indications are that this important experi(cid:173)ment in higher education wm prove highly successful. I am pleased also to be able to give you the advance news that our regional post(cid:173)secondary educational consortium is a reality. On July 29th, a news conference wm be held in Kansas City to announce the formal in(cid:173)corporation of the University of Mid-Amer(cid:173)ica. This new and significant educational compact will be a non-profit corporation formed to pool the resources of seven major state universities in five midwestern states, and will be responsible for the design and development of open learning courses em(cid:173)ploying a new instructional design concept and a variety of educational technologies. UMA could, indeed, be this country's answer to the British Open University. The initial incorporators of the University of Mid-America will be the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, University of Missouri, Iowa State University and the University of Nebraska. The University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University, it is believed, will very shortly join the com(cid:173)pact and pool their resources as well. His(cid:173)torically, these seven institutions comprise the Mid-America State Universities Associa(cid:173)tion; thus, the impetus for initial incorpo(cid:173)ration. However, the bylaws and articles of incorporation of the University of Mid(cid:173)America will indicate that other states and educational institutions will be encouraged to join in this important educational endeavor. Specifically, we are initially thinking of the contiguous states of Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota and Montana. Initial contacts with major universities in the surrounding states indicate a high degree of interest. The new open learning courees are being so des-lgna.ted as to allow their ready export and use in these as well as other states. This most important national experiment has been carefully nurtured and supported by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. NIE officials are well aware of the potential importance of the 8-U-N/UMA de(cid:173)velopment as a significant improvement to higher education in this country. Pending the successful completion of certain work assignments during calendar 1974, it has been the joint plan of NIE staff and our(cid:173)selves to seek a five year funding plan to al(cid:173)low full demonstration of the regional open learning model and development toward ultimate self -sufficiency. With this project so carefully laid, it was with great concern that we learned of the potential reduction in budget for the Na(cid:173)tional Institute of Education. This is mos~ unfortunate and should represent a serious concern to all senators and representatives of the Midwest and Great Plains states. We would hope that you would so advise Mem(cid:173)bers of Congress as to both the importance of this major educational development and the potential dangers of inadequate appro(cid:173)priations. The exact impact of the reduction of the NIE request on the University of Mid(cid:173)America is not at this time clear. With in(cid:173)adequate funding for NIE, it could create important problems for the future develop(cid:173)ment of this model regional open learning system. It is my impression we could limp along with a vastly reduced scope and serv(cid:173)ice, but the full and exciting potential of the University of Mid-America and the opportu(cid:173)nity to systematically improve higher edu(cid:173)cation could suffer irreparable damage. I wanted to provide you with this latest in(cid:173)formation, with the hope that you might share it with your colleagues. I am sending a similar letter to Congressman Thone that he might discuss the problem with members of the House. The presidents of the other University of Mid-America institutions share my concern, and join me in urging your every assistance. Yours truly, D. B. VARNER, President. IMMUNITY AND AMNESTY Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, as they have always done in times of tran(cid:173)sition, especially sudden transitions under unhappy circumstances, the American people and Congress are united today in support of our new Pres(cid:173)ident, Gerald Ford. With his long ex(cid:173)perience as a leading Member of Con(cid:173)gress, President Ford is uniquely quali(cid:173)fied to work in mutual trust and har(cid:173)mony with the Congress, and in so doing to restore unity and confidence in gov(cid:173)ernment to the American people. As we offer our assistance to a new President, it is no less appropriate that we offer our best wishes to the departing President, Richard Nixon, along with an expression of appreciation for his con(cid:173)tributions to world peace. As was evident. in his speech last night, that is what he hopes to be remembered for. And as one who opposed his Vietnam policy but later came to admire and support his creative and successful initiatives for(cid:173)peace in relations with the Soviet Union and China and in the Middle East, I believe that hope will be realized. More than any other President since World War II, Mr. Nixon has grasped and acted upon the preeminent necessity of the post-war era. As he enunciated it in his fine speech of last June 5 at Annapolis: ",
            "354": "27674 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE August 12, 197 4 However, notice of injury and claim forms must be submitted for review and adjudication by the Secretary of Labor before payment is certified to the U.S. Treasury. Consequently, the employee often suffers a delay in income. This fact was borne out vividly by a special Gen(cid:173)eral Accounting Office report which noted that the delay averaged between 49 to 70 days. In addition to causing difficult administrative problems for the Secretary of Labor and the employing agencies, such a delay creates severe economic hardship on the injured em(cid:173)ployee and his or her family. To remedy this situation, the bill au(cid:173)thorizes the employing agency to con(cid:173)tinue payment of an employee's pay where the employee files a claim under the act related to a traumatic injury, and provides that the pay shall con(cid:173)tinue, unless the claim controverted, for a period of up to 45 days. In the event a claim is controverted, the employee may utilize either accumulated sick leave, an(cid:173)nualleave, or have an adjustment made to regular pay as an overpayment in ac(cid:173)cordance with existing law. The intent of this \"continuation of pay\" provision is not to increase the amount of net income for the period im(cid:173)mediately following the :filing of a claim related to work-connected traumatic in(cid:173)jury, but to eliminate interruptions in the cash flow for the employee. Any amounts received under this provision would be subject to the same deductions, withholdings, and taxes that such pay(cid:173)ments would have incurred had the em(cid:173)ployee been receiving his or her regular salary or wages. JOB RETENTION RIGHTS A second key provision assures Federal employees, including those of the United States Postal Service, who are injured on the job and receiving disability compen(cid:173)sation, that during their period of dis(cid:173)ability they will incur no loss of benefits which they would have received absent the injury or disease. It permits an in(cid:173)jured employee to return to his former or equivalent position if he recovers within 1 year from the date compensa(cid:173)tion begins, or 1 year from recurrence of that same injury or disease. For those employees whose disability extends be(cid:173)yond 1 year, the employing agency or department is to grant priority in em(cid:173)ployment to the injured worker. EXPANSION OF SERVICES AND FACILITIES The bill will also permit injured em(cid:173)ployees a choice of private physicians and medical facilities, as well as the con(cid:173)tinued use of the available Federal facil(cid:173)ities. This freedom of choice is in accord(cid:173)ance with the recommendations of the National Commission on State Work(cid:173)men's Compensation Laws. Under exist(cid:173)ing law, an injured worker is required to make use of available U.S. facilities such as the Public Health Service, and Veter(cid:173)ans' Administration hospitals for medi(cid:173)cal services; private physicians desig(cid:173)nated by the Secretary may be used only if the Government fac1lities are not oth(cid:173)erwise available. The act's definitions of \"physicians\" and \"medical, surgical, and hospital services and supplies\" have been ex-panded to include dentists, clinical psy(cid:173)chologists, optometrists, podiatrists, and, to a limited extent, chiropractors. These \u2022 additional categories are a rec(cid:173)ognition of the need for specialized pro(cid:173)fessional services which should be avail(cid:173)able directly to the disabled worker. Cur(cid:173)rently, such services are available only through referral by a treating or super(cid:173)vising medical doctor. A similar provi(cid:173)sion covering clinical psychologists and optometrists has been enacted into law (P.L. 93-363) in connection with the Federal employee benefits program. This expansion of medical services is a recognition that injured workers de(cid:173)sire a wider range of medical treatment, and that Federal employees' compensa(cid:173)tion should allow such choice. COMPENSATION FOR PROSTHETIC DEVICES Under existing law, no compensation is generally paid with respect to loss of personal property due to accident, re(cid:173)gardless of the fact that the accident re(cid:173)sulted in personal injury. Nonreimburs(cid:173)able personal property has included such items as artificial limbs and other prosthetic devices. The bill would amend the definition of the term \"injury\" to include damage to or destruction of medical braces, ar(cid:173)tificial limbs, and other prosthetic de(cid:173)vices. It will require the Government to compensate injured employees for dam(cid:173)age to artificial appliances or prosthetic devices, as well as for any time lost while such device or appliance is being replaced or repaired. A prosthetic device would be considered a part of the body for all intents and purposes of this act, and the Secretary would be required to reimburse an employee for the loss or damage to such device if caused by an employment-related incident or series of incidents. BENEFITS TO SURVIVING SPOUSE The bill will also reallocate benefits to surviving spouses by increasing their share generally by 5 percent. The present benefit ceiling of 75 percent of the de(cid:173)ceased employee's earning is maintained; that is, the existing maximum a family may receive in the aggregate is un(cid:173)changed. The amendment will increase the benefits for a widow or widower with(cid:173)out eligible dependent children from 45 to 50 percent. If the surviving spouse has a dependent child, the widow's or wid(cid:173)ower's share will be increased from 40 to 45 percent, with an addiitonal 15 per(cid:173)cent for each child up to a combined maximum total of 75 percent. I believe that the additional benefits provided by this bill will alleviate some of the existing inadequacies now being accorded to surviving spouses. However, I would like to call attention to a recom(cid:173)mendation of the National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws which urges that a widow or widower receive 66% percent of the weekly wage of the deceased. As the National Commission pointed out: Work-related deaths account for less than one percent of all workmen's compensa.tlon claims and less than 10 percent of all bene(cid:173)fits. As the ultimate tragedy, work-related death deserves full compensation. The infre(cid:173)quency of death claims permits payment of substantial death benefits at a relatively small cost in the total budget of a modern workmen's compensation program. According to the latest Department of Labor statistics, FECA benefits amounted to approximately $250 million. If the maximum aggregate family ceiling of 75 percent were retained, the cost of imple(cid:173)menting the National Commission's rec(cid:173)ommendation would represent just a 3.8-percent increase over the total FECA payments. Currently,. there are 4,100 surviving spouses without eligible children who are collecting FECA benefits. There are also 700 spouses, each with one eligible child, and 500 spouses each with two or more children whose benefits would be in(cid:173)creased by such a change. The average case is now receiving $4,418 per year. Based on the latest average wage base-$9,400-of all such claimants, the actual proportion of com(cid:173)pensation received is only 47.5 percent of the decreased employee's wages. With the adoption of the National Commis(cid:173)sion's recommendation the average pay(cid:173)ment would be increased by $1,650 to $6,068 per year. I would hope that the Department of Labor will seriously consider the feasi(cid:173)bility of such an adjustment. COVERAGE OF FEDERAL JURORS The act has been amended so that coverage will include all otherwise eli(cid:173)gible Federal employees who are dis(cid:173)abled or killed while serving as Federal grand or petit jurors. It is the intent of this provision to apply coverage on the same basis as if the juror were an em(cid:173)ployee on a special mission as part of his Federal employment. The Department of Labor has rejected all such claims for compensation :filed by Federal jurors regardless of their regular employment on the basis that Federal jurors do not come within the present statutory definition of Federal em(cid:173)ployees. We believe that the existing sit(cid:173)uation is unfair to those who are per(cid:173)forming such a vital and important civic duty. Furthermore, the committee rec(cid:173)ognizes and concurs with the resolution of the Judicial Conference of the United States, adopted March 1974, which calls for the coverage of all persons serving as Federal jurors. I would urge that such action be considered in conjunction with the matter of Federal juror compensa(cid:173)tion now being studied by the Senate Judiciary Committee. VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION H.R. 13871 will permit the Secretary of Labor to continue the compensation rate without reduction as an inducement for partially disabled workers to enter into approved programs of rehabilitation so that they may eventually return to work and leave the compensation rolls. Present law requires a reduction in compensa(cid:173)tion when a Federal employee's disabntty changes from total to partial. This prac(cid:173)tice works a hardship on those workers who are enrolled, or who would like to enroll, in a vocational rehabilitation pro(cid:173)gram. I am hopeful that the bill will be used in a manner which promotes the concept of vocational rehabilitation to the maximum extent possible. ",

In 1971, tuberculosis, nephritis, intestinal diseases, prematurity, and syphilis were not included among the 10 largest killers. Instead, there was a higher percentage of deaths related to heart disease, cancer, stroke and other conditions which had not previously been on the list which are chronic conditions associated with old age. Some might say that this evidence indicates that we are losing ground. But the observer who sees a glass half full rather than half empty knows that we have made real and substantial progress in overcoming premature death. In fact, communicable and infectious diseases whose very names were once sufficient to evoke terror-diphtheria, typhoid, typhus, smallpox-are now all but forgotten. In the not too distant future, we may well be able to add ru(cid:173)bella, measles, and polio to that list. Just over 20 years ago polio was one of the most dreaded diseases. Since then polio has been almost totally eliminated. In 1972, there were fewer than 40 new cases of polio reported in America. There is no reason to believe that other disease(cid:173)control programs will not be equally ef(cid:173)fective. The opportunity of accomplishing this goal is presented to us by this bill. It would provide Federal assistance in sup(cid:173)porting public health activities which each State may choose in its effort to accomplish its own most important health objectives, under title I, the health revenue sharing authorization. Titles II, III, IV, and V would promote health saving and assuring activities. Assistance to family planning activities, under title II, would encourage services to assure proper family size at the ap(cid:173)propriate time. Assistance in avoiding the problems related to unwanted children will be provided. As an original sponsor of the family planning legislation, I am particularly pleased with the committee's extension and improvement of this vital law. The case of unwanted children whose families could not afford to support them was poignantly presented to me when, as a very junior Congressman, I was forced by an aircraft malfunction to make an unplanned stop in Calcutta, India. There the frightening experience of losing an aircraft engine in flight was overshadow(cid:173)ed by the horror of seeing emaciated children dying in the gutter. It was this cultural shock which prompted me to of(cid:173)fer the Matsunaga family planning amendment to Public Law 480, the Food for Peace Act. The activities carried out under this amendment have helped India to reduce its booming population growth. We can be grateful that the United States has never suffered from such ex(cid:173)treme overpopulation. We have been spared the indignity of public death of our children, but many American fami(cid:173)lies are unable to provide proper care and nutrition to their unwanted children. It is the relief of these families-and of the children themselves-that title II is intended to provide. Similarly, title III, the community mental health centers program, is an effort to reduce pain by preventing it. We now know that mental public health activities can successfully reduce the in(cid:173)cidence of mental disease, or failing the reduction of incidence, at least lessen the duration and intensity. In addition tore(cid:173)ducing the pain of mental illness--and this is an immeasurable benefit-we al(cid:173)ready know that the community mental health centers programs are effective in the reduction of the amount of expensive mental health hospitalization which the States must provide and the patients must endure. Indeed, like family plan(cid:173)ning, the community mental health pro(cid:173)gram is among the most humane pro(cid:173)vided by Congress. The Health Revenue Sharing and Health Services Act of 1974 is truly a commendable legislative effort-one which we, who vote to approve, will be able to list among our accomplishments with justifiable pride. Mr. DELLUMS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Health Services Act. Title II of this measure authorizes an extension of the Family Planning Serv(cid:173)ices and Population Research Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-572). Last year, prior to the passage of the Health Programs Ex(cid:173)tensions Act, I introduced H.R. 6021-along with 46 cosponsors-to extend family planning services and population research programs through fiscal year 1978. Earlier this year I testified before the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, and I wish to commend the members of that committee for their fine work as exemplified in tl:.tis bill. All of us agree that it is a fundamen(cid:173)tal human right to decide whether or not to bear or beget a child. The family planning services programs of the Fed(cid:173)eral Government provides the means by which all people-regardless of income(cid:173)may exercise this right. Furthermore, I have not heard anyone condemn either the quality or the cost of family plan(cid:173)ning services provided under title X of the Public Health Service Act. Members of the committee-and indeed a great many of our colleagues-recognize that these programs provide an excellent and needed service and that they should be continued. No one contends that the family plan(cid:173)ning project grants are ineffective, too costly or unnecessary. But earlier this year, the Nixon administration proposed an immediate halt to the growth of the program through project grants. HEW announced its intention to finance ex(cid:173)pansion through title IV-A-social serv(cid:173)ices-and title XIX-medicaid-and to phase out project grants to the maxi(cid:173)mum possible extent in the near future. This shift, from a health to a welfare orientation, carried with it considerable implications in terms of eligibility for family p~anning services, in terms of standards of care for family planning, and in terms of freedom from coercion, actual or implied. I believe that had the Department's initiative been allowed to succeed, it would have done irreparable harm to what has been up to now a popular, effective program broadly ac(cid:173)cepted and utilized by low-income women and men. I support the continuation and expan(cid:173)sion of the authorization for family plan(cid:173)ning services project grants because I believe this is the best mechanism for the provision of such services. It was on this crucial point that I was in very basic and strong disagreement with the Nixon administration. I am glad that they de(cid:173)cided to listen, and to-finally--support this legislation. Medicaid and title IV -A programs are undesirable as primary vehicles for the provision of family planning services to women who are poor: These are programs in which eligibility is very narrowly defined. These are programs over which we Members of Congress have very little control. They make no pretense of having na(cid:173)tional standards of medical care. They are national only in the sense that they are made up of an aggregate of 50 welfare programs each having 50 varying State criteria for eligibility and quite different State standards of care. They are administered, for the most part, by State welfare agencies, some of which are not exactly known for their high level of concern for the health and well-being of low-i:qcome women or for their progressive policies with regard to such women and their personal pri(cid:173)vacy. I do not believe that State wel(cid:173)fare agencies which staged midnight \"man in the house\" raids and have been known to threaten or actually force women off welfare rolls, can be trusted totally to insure voluntarism as a basic principle in the conduct of birth control programs. Even if they are, I am. sure that prospective patients would be leery of the intentions of these agencies and reluctant to participate in family plan(cid:173)ning programs sponsored by public as(cid:173)sistance agencies. Furthermore, I fear that the suspicions of those who cry \"genocide\" would all too soon be rein(cid:173)forced if family planning services become too closely associated with these and other welfare programs. It is imperative from my viewpoint, that strong Federal direction and supervision be present in these programs at all times. Let me also point out that there is unanimous agreement that medicaid is an extremely expensive and ineffective program which has failed specifically to provide preventive health services. Many physicians refuse to treat medicaid(cid:173)eligible patients, and the relatively few that do generally have incredibly busy practices with little time to give each patient. Women who are poor and must rely on medicaid for their health care needs are neither as knowledgeable nor can they afford to be as demanding of their physicians as can the average middle(cid:173)class woman. Medicaid physicians canal(cid:173)ways refuse services to any recipient if they so choose. We saw what happened in Aiken, S.C., when medicaid women re(cid:173)fused to be bullied into sterilization. When the physicians who insisted on sterilization as a condition of their pro(cid:173)viding prenatal and obstetrical care to medicaid patients were condemned for their behavior, they simply refused to provide services to medicaid patients. The result, according to the Medical Tribune, ",

Und~ this election, the maXimum amount deductible generally wm be normal cost under the plan less the amount needed to amorti~e over 10 years (principal plus interest) the decrease in plan liabilities as a result of the plan amendment. However, if a plan is fully fund(cid:173)ed without regard to the collectively bar(cid:173)gained decrease in Uab111ties, no deduction is to be allowed. If a plan elects this provision, the amounts deductible in future years for contributions to the plan will be decreased (pursuant to regulations) by the amount re(cid:173)quired for a 10-year amortization of the collectively bargained decrease in liabilities. A special rule is provided With respect to plans of regulated public utilities doing business in 40 States and furnishing certain telephone or other communications services which are rate regulated. (This rule also applies to plans of other companies which are members of a controlled group that in(cid:173)cludes such a public utility doing business in 40 States.) Under this provision, if the Secretary of the Treasury finds that the plan is a. collectively bargained plan, the rules described above for deductions Where there have been decreases in Ua\u2022bllities on account of plan amendments would apply to decreases in plan 11ab111ttes as a result of an increase in benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. Effective dates In the case of new plans, the funding pro(cid:173)visions are to apply to the first full plan year beginning after the date of enactment of the bill. For example, if a plan was established on October 1, 1974, but its plan year is a calendar year, the new provisions are to apply to the plan year beginnine: January 1. 1975. Generally, in the case of plans existing on January 1, 1974, the new funding provisions are to become applicable for plan years beginning after December 31, 1975. In the case of collectively bargained plans (both single employer and multiemployer plans) existing on January 1, 1974, the effective date would be delayed until the termination of the contract existing on January 1, 1974, but not later than plan years beginning after December 31, 1980. Where an employer has plans which involve both collective bargain(cid:173)ing unit employees and other employees, the effective dates applicable to collectively bar(cid:173)gained plans are to govern if (on January 1, 1974) at least 25 percent of the plan partici(cid:173)pants are members of the employee unit cov(cid:173)ered by the collectively bargained agreement. (This is described more fully in connection with the effective dates for participation.) Where a qualified plan does not meet the funding requirements of existing law because of vesting or participation requirements made appl1cable by the substitute and where the funding requirements of the conference substitute do not become applicable until a later time than the vesting or participation requirements, then to the extent that failure to meet the funding requirements of existing law is attributable to these new vesting or participation requirements, no plan is to be disqualified in this interim period-on the grounds of underfunding. The effective date for the rules with respect to maximum deduction limits is the same as the effective date for the funding rules generally. \u00b7 V. FIDUCIARY RESPONSmiLITY (SECS. 401-414 AND 2003 OF THE BILL AND SEC. 4975 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE) HCYUSe bflZ and Senate amendment The House bill generally includes rules governing the responsib111ty of plan fiduci(cid:173)aries only in the labor provisions of the bill (title I). The labor provisions establish rules governing the basic responsibiUties of plan as \"prohibited transactions.\" (Present law under the Internal Revenue Code has similar prohibited transaction rules, which were unchanged by the House bill.) Under the Hou~e blll, all plan fiduciaries must act with respect to the plan, in ac(cid:173)cordance 'with a \"prudent man\" rule. In ad(cid:173)dition, plan fiduciaries generally must diver(cid:173)sify plan investments (With certain excep(cid:173)tions for profit-sharing plans, etc., that invest in employer securities) and must act for the exclusive benefit of the plan participants and beneficiaries. The House bill also pro(cid:173)vides that all plans must be in writing, that plan assets generally are to be held in trust, and that trustees generally are to have the exclusive authority to manage and control plan assets. However, asset management in certain circumstances may be delegated to qualified investment managers. The bill also provides that plan trustees may allocate their responsibiUties if the plan so provides and that in this event generally only the persons to whom responsib111ties have been allocated would be liable for a surcharge. Under the House bill, fiduciaries generally are prohibited from dealing on behalf of a plan with persons known to be parties-in(cid:173)interest unless the dealings are for adequate consideration. Also, the blll generally pro(cid:173)hibits fiduciaries from dealing with plan assets for their own accounts, receiving con(cid:173)sidera.tion from other parties dealing with the plan in a transaction involving the plan, or acting in a transaction involving the plan on behalf of a person who is adverse to the plan. Under the House bill, a fiduciary is to be personally liable for losses to the plan result(cid:173)ing from violations of the fiduciary responsi(cid:173)bllity rules. Th\u00b7e Senate amendment includes rules gov(cid:173)erning fiduciary responsib111ty in both the la(cid:173)bor and tax provisions. The labor provisions of the amendment, as in the case of the House blll, deal with the basic responsibility of fidu(cid:173)ciaries, plan administrators, and structure; also and these provisions would establish certain transactions as prohibited transac(cid:173)tions. Fiduciaries (and parties-in-interest) are to be personally liable under the labor provisions for losses sustained by a plan that result from a violation of these rules. The tax provisions of the amendment also establish prohibited transaction rules (which are nearly identical to the rules in the labor provision) which are to be enforced through an excise tax on parties-in-interest. The Senate amendment rules governing the basic responsibil1ties of plan fiduciaries (e.g., acting with prudence and for the exclusive benefit of participants and benefi(cid:173)ciaries) are similar to the rules of the House bill. W~th respect to plan administration, the amendment does not require plan assets generally to be held in trust nor does it require that assets be administered by trust(cid:173)ees. The amendment would, however, deem plan assets to be held in trust. Also, the Senate amendment does not include provi(cid:173)sions similar to those of the House bill with respect to allocation of responsib111ties among trustees. Under both the labor and tax provisions of the Senate admendment, plan fiduciaries generally are prohibited from engaging in specified transactions with parties-in-inter(cid:173)est whether or not these transactions are for adequate consideration. However, the amend(cid:173)ment provides for administrative variances from these prohibitions if certain conditions are met, and also would provide statutory ex(cid:173)emptions for, e.g., paying reasonable com(cid:173)pensation to parties-in-interest for services rendered to the plan which are necessary for the plan's operation. The amendment also would prohibit a fiduciary from dealing with the plan assets on his own account, receiving consideration from other parties dealing with the plan, and acting on behalf of a person adverse to the plan. Fiduciary responsibility rules, in general The conference substitute establishes rules governing the conduct of plan fiduciaries un(cid:173)der the labor laws (title I) and also estab(cid:173)lishes rules governing the conduct of dis(cid:173)qualified persons (who are generally the same people as \"parties in interest\" under the labor provisions) with respect to the plan under the tax laws (title II). This divi(cid:173)sion corresponds to the basic difference in focus of the two departments. The labor law provisions apply rules and remedies similar to those under traditional trust law to govern the conduct of fiduciaries. The tax law pro(cid:173)visions apply a.n excise tax on disqualified persons who violate the new prohibited transaction rules; this is similar to the ap(cid:173)proach taken under the present rules against self-dealing that apply to private founda(cid:173)tions. The labor provisions deal with the struc(cid:173)ture of plan administration, provide general standards of conduct for fiduciaries, and make certain specific transactions \"prohib(cid:173)ited transactions\" which plan fiduciaries are not to engage in. The tax provisions in(cid:173)clude only the prohibited transaction rules and apply only to disqualifled persons, not fiduciaries (unless the fiduciary is otherwise a disqualified person and the transaction in(cid:173)volved him, or the fiduciary benefited from the transaction). To the maximum extent possible, the prohibited transaction rules are identical in the labor and tax provisions, so they will apply in the same manner to the same transaction. (However, there are some differences, such as not prohibiting under the tax law an act to which the tax sanc(cid:173)tion cannot appropriately apply.) Coverage of the labor provisions The labor fiduciary respons1b111ty rules generally apply to all employee benefit plans (both retirement plans and welfare plans) in or affecting interstate commerce. The usual exceptions for government plans. church plans (which do not elect to have the participation, vesting, funding, and in\u00b7 surance rules apply), workmen's compensa(cid:173)tion plans, and nonresident alien plans ap(cid:173)ply here as well as to the other parts of the labor provisions. In addition, the labor fidu(cid:173)ciary rules do not apply to an unfunded plan primarily devoted to providing deferred compensation for a select group of man(cid:173)agement or highly compensated employees. For example, if a \"phantom stock\" or \"shad(cid:173)ow stock\" plan were to be established solely for the omcers of a corporation, it would not be covered by the labor fiduciary rules. Also, a deferred compensation arrangement solely for retiring partners (under sec. 736 of the Internal Revenue Code) is to be ex(cid:173)empt from the fiduciary respons1b11ity rules. Additionally, the fiduciary responsibility rules do not apply to a so-called excess benefit plan which is unfunded. Since mutual funds are regulated by the Investment Company Act of 1940 and, since (under the Internal Revenue Code) mutual funds must be broadly held, it is not con(cid:173)sidered necessary to apply the fiduciary rules to mutual funds merely because plans invest in their shares. Therefore, the substitute provides that the mere investment by a plan 1n the shares of a mutual fund 1s not to be suftlcient to cause the assets of the fund to be considered the assets of the plan. (How(cid:173)ever, a plan's assets will include the shares of a mutual fund held by the plan.) The substitute also provides that a mu(cid:173)tual fund is not to be considered a fiduc1ary or a party-in-interest merely because a plan invests in its shares, except that the mutual fund may be a fiduciary or party-in-interest if it acts in connection with a plan covering the employees of the investment company, ,. \u2022' .

MORE CANCER DEATHS FROM INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS? HON. DAVID R. OBEY OF WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, August 12, 1974 Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, the follow(cid:173)ing article from this morning's Wash(cid:173)ington Post tells about what is happen(cid:173)ing in a small community in Maryland which may be a result of our ignorance of the effect of industrial chemicals on hu(cid:173)man health. The article also gives us an excellent example of the human cost which can result from the kind of indis(cid:173)criminate budget slashing which the Office of Management and Budget en(cid:173)gaged in during the last administration. Of the 120 permanent residents of the Little Elk Valley in Maryland, 1 out of 6 has died since 1967. The pri(cid:173)mary factor in this high death rate is cancer. People in the community have been contracting cancer at more than seven times the rate of other commu(cid:173)nities in the United States. A prime sus(cid:173)pect in this excessive number of cancer deaths is a local chemical plant. Although Congress established an agency in 1971 called the National Insti(cid:173)tute of Occupational Safety and Health to investigate such health problems, the article concludes with a description of how inadequate the NIOSH efforts have been in this particular situation. This is of little surprise to those of us on the Appropriations Committee who have been concerned about the inade(cid:173)quate staffing and underfunding of this agency for some time. Only last year OMB forced a staff cut of 96 positions or almost one-sixth of the entire staff of this agency, which by all accounts was already critically understaffed. The cut was made in blatant disregard to lan(cid:173)guage in both the House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports di(cid:173)recting that no cut be made. The Director of NIOSH summed up what was happening to his agency when he was quoted by The New York Times on March 6 of this year as saying: NIOSH is not expanding it is shrinking. It is getting the proverbial meat axe. Our pres(cid:173)ent Laboratory space isn't even adequate for any kind of research. It ls substandard. We have been frozen on hirings for most of our existence and we are losing key staff right and left because we don't have the grade point to promote them. I don't think NIOSH is a viable organization at this time. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS So, it is little wonder that the Federal Government cannot respond to the crit(cid:173)ical problem of the people of Little Elk Valley. This year the House Appropriations Committee Increased the funding for NIOSH by almost 25 percent over the President's request and directed the ad(cid:173)ministration to increase the number of positions in the agency by 135. This money should have a major impact on the capacity of the agency to investi(cid:173)gate such hazards as the one in Mary(cid:173)land, but there are many problems such as adequate Laboratory and office space and sufficient grade point to hire quali(cid:173)fied staff which will continue to be road(cid:173)blocks. Clearly, we are never going to have the kind of research effort that is needed in this area until the White House, the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare all come to understand that the cost of our ignorance in this area is human lives and that study of the health implications of industrial chemi(cid:173)cals like those in the Little Elk Valley deserves a much higher priority than it has received in the past. The article follows: [From the Washington Post, Aug. 12, 1974] CANCER, DEATH RATES FOUND HIGH IN MARYLAND VALLEY (By Blll Richards) PROVIDENCE, MD.-No one is quite sure why, but for the past few years the people of the Little Elk Valley here have been dying off at an alarming rate. Since 1967, 20 of the 120 people who have lived here for more than two years have died, according to a study of the Little Elk's popu(cid:173)lation by a local doctor. The ages of those who died range from 5 to 70. That figure puts the death rate for the valley about 2.2 times ahead of the rest of surrounding Cecll County, in the northern corner of the state. More ominous, Dr. Pietro U. Capurro's tabulation shows that at least eight of those deaths, and possibly more, have been from cancer, making the cancer death rate here seven times the rest of the county's 53,000 residents. The county's cancer rate is above average for rural areas in the U.S., according to statisticians from the National Cancer Institute. Suspicion concerning the valley's un(cid:173)usually high death and cancer levels has been compounded by several types of cancers identified here by Capurro, a 49-year-old pathologist and director of the laboratory at Union Hospital in nearby Elkton. The cancers-lymphomas, leukemia and pancreas cancer-have all been linked in the past in various studies and bV medical re(cid:173)searchers to exposure to certain indus trial chemicals. Exposure to certain industrial chemicals can lead to cancer that possibly may not ap(cid:173)pear for 10 or more years, according to Na\u00b7 tiona! Cancer Institute specialists. All of the cancer victims described in Ca(cid:173)purro's report lived within a mile of the Little Elk Valley's only industrial plant-The Gal(cid:173)axy Chemical Company, which has been re(cid:173)processing chemicals here since 1961. Paul J. Mraz, the president of Galaxy, de(cid:173)scribed Capurro's findings as \"unsubstan(cid:173)tiated\" and \"nothing new\" during a short telephone interview recently. Mraz declined to comment further on the doctor's report or allow a reporter to tour the plant and conduct a lengthier in-person in(cid:173)terview, \"I can't make any further comment on the advice of my attorney,\" he said. During the last four years a number or residents including Capurro, who lived in August 12, 1974 the valley for four years until 1972, com(cid:173)plained that chemical fumes from the plant had made them ill. Samples of the air around the Galaxy plant, taken by investigators for the Mary(cid:173)land bureau of air quality control after com(cid:173)plaints in 1970 and 1971, showed the presence of about 25 chemicals in the valley's air and water that were foreign to the area but that matched a list of chemicals handled by the plant, according to Carl York, head of the bureau's compliance section. One of the chemicals repeatedly identified in the samples, York said, was benzene, a substance that Mraz recently acknowledged his firm had handled in the past and that he said is stlll being reprocessed at the plant. Dr. Herman Kraybill, scientific coordina(cid:173)tor for environmental carcinogens (cancer(cid:173)causing substances) at The National Cancer Institute, said benzene is strongly suspected by researchers of being linked to leukemia in some persons exposed to the chemical. Carbon tetrachloride, which Kraybill said has been found to produce liver tumors in laboratory rats, mice and hamsters, was found in other samples taken in the valley by Capurro. The laboratory results with car(cid:173)bon tetrachloride, Kraybill said, \"raises a high index of suspicion as to its human po(cid:173)tential.\" Mraz recently told a reporter that his firm handled carbon tetrachloride for only one or two weeks in the late 1960s and does not handle the chemical anymore. York said that some other chemicals dis(cid:173)covered in the valley were so exotic that they could not be adequately identified and their toxicity was not known by researchers. Neither Capurro nor any other researcher has specifically linked the chemicals found in the valley with the cancer deaths there. ca(cid:173)purro, however, said the findings show a strong need for more testing of the plant and the valley's past and present residents. Capurro says he has performed his own tests on air and water samples as well as on blood samples from persons living near the plant. \"I can't say that the deaths in the valley from cancer were the result of specific expo(cid:173)sure to chemical fumes,\" he said. \"But there have been a lot of chemicals in that valley's air and water and the blood of those people we tested,\" he said, \"and some of those chemicals cause cancer. And we know there are a lot more malignancies there than you would expect. \"If you're in a room where everyone is scratched and there's a lion in there too, then you've got to suspect the lion.\" Capurro is not alone in his belief that something is wrong medically in the valley. State and federal investigators who have been there said that the physical condition of a number of res:idents there is unusual. \"We know ther.e's something up there in the valley that's not right, some sort of a health problem,\" said York of the state bureau of air quality control. \"What we don't know is whether it's coming from Galaxy.\" York worked for eight months in 1967 and 1968 as an engineer for Galaxy at the Little Elk Valley plant and is now responsible for inspecting it and conducting air sampling in the valley. He said that until 1971 the company dumped residues from its reprocessing opera(cid:173)ation into an open air evaporation pit behind the plant. Among the substances put into the pit, he said, was the residue from the benzene re-processing operation. \"We know that benzene was dumped into that pit,\" said York, \"and there were several other chemicals we suspected were carcino(cid:173)gens. But the whole thing was such a gunky mess that it's questionable whether the com(cid:173)pany even knew what it was evaporating in there.\" Leonard Madison, an ex-foreman at the plant who died recently, and a second former supervisor who asked not to be identified, ' ",

If a country hold(cid:173)ing an offshore island can claim a 200-mile economic zone around it, !or instance, then the whole of the Mediterranean and Carib(cid:173)bean Seas and about half the Pacific Ocean become subject to national claims. To make the deep seabed a \"common heritage,\" more(cid:173)over is to impose new controls there as well. The~e would reduce the existing :reedom of private or national entrepreneurs in order to spread the expected mineral benefl ts to states not in a position to exploit them themselves. This drive to write new rules !or the sea results from the world's growing hunger !or the sea's resources, from the increasing so(cid:173)phistication of the technology with which to exploit these resources, and from the grow(cid:173)ing likelihood that nations striving for them wlll take arms if law is not first applied. Unsurprisingly, it is those nations with long coastlines plentiful resources near their coasts (both in the water and under the seabed) and advanced technology which are in the strongest position to get what they want from the high seas. More than any other country, the United States has all three. But this does not mean it can go it alone. With its great navy and its global political role, the United States needs the right of continued, politically uncluttered through the various in terna tiona! stra1 ts which would fall within one or another state's territorial waters under a 12-mile territorial-sea rule. This is a major goal for the American negotiators at Caracas. Fishing is a knotty problem. Japanese and Russian \"distant-water\" fleets have grossly overfished haddock and salmon stocks, for example, off the American coast. But the United States has been reluctant to invoke a 200-mile economic zone because its own tuna and shrimp fleets fish within 200 miles of other nations' shores. Washington is now ready to accept the 200-mile concept but it wishes to keep some fisheries open to its tuna and shrimp fleets and, most important, to ensure that effective conservation and re(cid:173)source management measures are adopted all around. As to a deep-seabed international regime to extract minerals for the \"common heritage,\" the United States would have the new au(cid:173)thority to simply license the exploiters and distribute the licensing revenues. But the Chinese, seeking a Third World leadership role, would arm the authority with the power to do the exploiting itself. American fishing, gas and oil, min1ng and maritime operators naturally have a strong commercial interest in any new international rules of the sea, just as the U.S .. government has a strong diplomatic and miUtary inter(cid:173)est. These interests, complex and sometimes contradictory, are all reflected in the Amer(cid:173)ican proposals at Caracas. Some mining and fishing groups have persuaded Congress to draft legislation that would, if enacted, pre(cid:173)empt international decisions on crucial is(cid:173)sues. Wisely, Congress has not acted on this legislation. The United States as much as any nation, needs the cooperation of others on the high seas. It can hardly expect to get such cooperation-indeed, its example wlll only breed conflict--if it acts alone. THE INTERNATIONAL LAW OF THE SEA CONFERENCE Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Third International Law of the Sea Con(cid:173)ference has been underway this summer in caracas, Venezuela, to update ocean law, essentially unchanged in 350 years. United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim delivered an opening speech which underscored the purpose of this conference-The need to reach a balance which enables us to exploit the riches of the sea while pre(cid:173)serving the interests of all ... We must try to ensure that the new law of the sea will en(cid:173)dure as the foundation of man's uses of the sea. Mr. President, I would like to report to my colleagues on progress to date at the conference which will draw to a close on August 29 after a 10-week session. Ambassador John R. Stevenson, Spe(cid:173)cial Representative of the President, has headed the U.S. delegation with John Norton Moore serving as Deputy Special Representative. Included in the Ameri(cid:173)can delegation are 13 alternates, 16 Sen(cid:173)ators and Members of the House, 6 ed(cid:173)ucators, 10 congressional staff members, 20 official advisers and a group of ex(cid:173)perts on petroleum, hard minerals, in(cid:173)ternational law, marine environment, fisheries, marine science and maritime industries. The opening days of the conference were primarily devoted to organization and procedure. The conference general committee designated three committees to handle issues under consideration: Committee !--seabed regime; commit(cid:173)tee 2-economic zone and all other agen(cid:173)da items not assigned to committees 1 and 3; and committee 3-pollution and research. The plenary session was as(cid:173)signed topics of peaceful uses of the ocean and universal participation in the Law of the Sea Treaty. All committees have considered first, regional arrange(cid:173)ments; second, responsibility and liabil(cid:173)ity for damage to the marine environ(cid:173)ment; third, settlement of disputes; and fourth, peaceful uses of the ocean. The conference established complex rules of procedure whereby a gentle(cid:173)men's agreement rather than a vote has been predominantly operative. Rules permit deferment of voting on substan(cid:173)tive matters until all possible efforts at compromise have been used. General debate, which began on June 28, has addressed a range of issues: ttr(cid:173)ritorial seas, transit through interna(cid:173)tional straits, protection of the marine environment, compulsory settlement of disputes and creation of an international regime for nondiscriminatory licensing and exploration of the deep seabed. Particular attention has been focused on consideration of a 200-mile economic zone owing to substantial fisheries inter(cid:173)est here in the United States. The eco(cid:173)nomic zone being discussed in Caracas would extend coastal State control of ma(cid:173)rine and mineral resources within and beneath adjacent waters, while guaran(cid:173)teeing freedom of navigation and allow(cid:173)ing foreign fleets certain rights to fish within coastal waters. While supporting this 200-mile economic zone, the U.S. delegation has called for compulsory third party settlement of disputes. This has elicited objection from several coun-\u00b7 tries and is now being debated. The 200-mile coastal State control would replace the traditional 3-mile limit established in the 17th century and sub(cid:173)sequent delineation of a contiguous 12-mile resource zone established in more recent years. Present depletion of various species of fish coupled with inadequate and ineffective international agreements to conserve and manage threatened fish stocks has prompted legislation, such as Senator MAGNUSON's bill, S. 1988, to ad\u00b7 dress the problem on an interim basis by declaring a 200-mile resource zone. Meanwhile, Mr. President, the eco(cid:173)nomic zone concept has emerged as the preeminent and pivotal issue before the Caracas conference and until an agree(cid:173)ment is reached, debate on other policies will not proceed expeditiously. Ambassador Stevenson has also stressed passage of military vessels and aircraft through and over international straits as an issue of major concern. Not only unimpeded transit but nondiscre(cid:173)tionary transit is essential to insure un(cid:173)restricted passage in terms of ship type(cid:173)submarine, supertanker, nuclear pow(cid:173)ered-and destination of cargo. Currently however, debate on these urgent issues has not produced the sub(cid:173)stantive results anticipated. The licens(cid:173)ing aspect of the seabed question has stalemated in committee 1. Committee 2, discussing the economic zone, may com(cid:173)plete this session with only a comparative table, not significantly different from the Seabed Committee's report avail(cid:173)able at the beginning of the conference. Scientific research, handled in committee 3, may not only be subjected to regula(cid:173)tion inside national jurisdiction, but out(cid:173)side as well. Ambassador Stevenson has expressed several misgivings concerning the pres(cid:173)ent tum of discussions. Canada, Chile, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Mauritius, Mexico, New Zealand, and Norway have proposed that articles be drafted as a framework for discussion of archipelagic state's rights, territorial sea, economic zones and the continental staff. Ambas(cid:173)sador Stevenson, however, holds that these proposed articles are too general for use as negotiable items. \u00b7 High seas freedom, particularly ger(cid:173)mane to the question of passage through international straits, has not been clearly preserved in proposals under considera(cid:173)tion, according to Ambass,ador Stevenson. In addition, the Ambassador expressed reservations concerning the lack of com(cid:173)pulsory dispute settlement provisions and absence of state duties insuring conser(cid:173)vation and full utilization of fish stocks. Freedom of the seas has been funda(cid:173)mental to international law since the Dutch jurist Grotius established the principle in 1609. That principle however, derived from Grotius' view of a limitless expanse which \"can be neither seized nor enclosed,\" is not viable in a world of dis(cid:173)parate interests seeking to exploit the ocean wealth. The major issues of re(cid:173)sources, rights, and responsibilities im(cid:173)mediately concern the nations of the world, and the Law of the Sea Conference is seeking to update ocean law to accom(cid:173)modate current and future world needs. Substantive progress in this direction, however, does not seem readily forth(cid:173)coming. While the final Law of the Sea Treaty should receive our close attention and hopefully provide a step forward in an international approach to global needs, the self-interests of the United States in vital issues of ocean policy must not be ignored in our efforts to achieve international agreement.

            "754": "28074 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE August 13, 1974 tn the late nineteen-:flfties that the recon(cid:173)struction period was over, 1t turned out to be extremely hM\"d to end the deficits. One reason was that the United States was reluc(cid:173)tant to give up its role as leader of the non(cid:173)Communist world. The 20th century had ac(cid:173)quired the blUing, at least in the United States, as \"the American century.\" Both the Korean and Vietnam wars s1gnlfled American determination to carry the \"free-world's bm-(cid:173)dens\"-the equivalent of B;r1ta.1n's \"White(cid:173)man's burden\" a century earlier. America's persistent payments deficits were not due solely to its military actions and economic aid programs. Of growing impor(cid:173)tance, as the deficits went on yeM\" after year, was the overvaluation of the United states dollar in relation to gold and to other currencies. This hurt American exports and made imports, as well as travel and foreign investment, cheaper for Americans. So the migration of American business ovet\"seas went on apace, with corporations using abun(cid:173)dant and overvalued dollars to buy up for(cid:173)eign assets, start branches and subsidiaries abroad, hire foreign labor and use other foreign resources to increase their world(cid:173)wide profits. Foreigners, in the midst of the dollar pros(cid:173)perity, where schizoid about the trend. :Many, especla.lly those in close partnership wlth the Americans, welcomed the growth that United States. capital, technology and managerla.l know-how helped bring. But there was increasing concern in Europe about the 1nftation that the dollar 1nftow was also helping to breed. And there was growing opposition to :the \"American chal(cid:173)lenge\" of economic and political domtnance-(cid:173)and about the recklessness of American mW(cid:173)tary policy. Vietnam particularly strained the political bonds between the United States and its European allles. It also sealed the doom of the postwar world monetary sys(cid:173)tem that had been buUt on a strong dollar and :flxed exchange rates between the dollar. gold and all other currencies. For Vietnam accelerated the outflow of dollars from the United States and, even more damaging, in(cid:173)creased domestic 1nftat1on. President Lyndon B. Johnson unleashed inflation at home by his unwlllingness to ask Congress either for a tax increase to pay for the Vietnam war or to cut his Great Society programs to make room for the war in the Federal budget. President Nixon inherited the inflation(cid:173)and eventually made it worse. After a year of trying to stop it by tight money alone. Mr. Nixon brought the country a ~recession. Find(cid:173)ing rising unemployment politically intoler(cid:173)able-especially with the 1972 Congressional elections looming-he switched to a highly expansive fiscal and monetary policy aimed at restoring full employment. For political reasons, he announced-few politicians had ever made it so explicit-\"! am now a Keymeslan.\" Under Nixonian management, the U.S. bal-ance-of-payments deficit worsened. Dollars poured out of the country, and on Aug. 16, 1971, as part of the \"New Economic Polley,\" Mr. NiXon slammed shut the gold window, refusing to pay out any more gold to foreign claimants in exchange for their surplus dol(cid:173)lars. Nevertheless, overvalued dollars con(cid:173)tinued to gush out as expectations of what would once have been unthinkable-a dollar devaluation-grew. Finally, on Dec. 18, 1971, at an extraordinary monetary conference at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, held amld the trappings and relics of the greatest achievement of American technology, the dollar was devalued by 8 per cent. The object of the Smithsonian conference, from the American standpoint, was to de(cid:173)value the dollar enough to produce equi(cid:173)llbrium, or, 1f possible, a big surplus, in the American balance of payments. This would, it was hoped, restore American economic powe!\" and prestige; it should also save their dollar standard,\" with the United States as kingpin of the world monetary system. For this rea(cid:173)son the Nixon Administration was, somewhat paradoxically, eager not to \"devalue the dol(cid:173)lar\" om.clally, but to make other Govern(cid:173)ments upvalue their currencies. Logically, there would seem to be no dif(cid:173)ference between devaluing one currency and upvaluing others in relation to it-and in(cid:173)deed there is virtually none. However, there was one important d11ference. The dollar had been regarded as the :flxed star of the world monetary system, the star around which all the other national currencies revolved. For the dollar to change its own value-to be devalued in relation to other currencies and to gold-would symbolize a radical change in the conception of the world monetary or(cid:173)der, like the Copernican revolution in which the earth was no longer seen as the unchang(cid:173)ing center of the universe. After the Smithsonian devaluation of the dollar, no matter how much the Americans might insist that the dollar was stm the fixed center of the world monetary system, the skeptics would go on saying, like GalUeo, \"But it does move.\" And in fact, after the Smithsonian agreement, United States om.(cid:173)cials themselves gradually accepted the new concept of a movable dollar. The Smithsonian agreement-the \"great(cid:173)est monetary agreement in the history of the world,\" Mr. Nixon called it-was sup(cid:173)posed to be a one-shot realignment of ex(cid:173)change rates that would preserve the fixed(cid:173)exchange-rate system created at Bretton Woods, N.H., in 1944. However, the Smith(cid:173)sonian agreement failed to hit on a rate structure that would restore monetary sta(cid:173)b111ty. With inflation raging at differential rates, that was doubtless impossible. The Nixon Administration, in any case made vir(cid:173)tually no e1fort to defend the Smithsonian exchange rates. It practiced the doctrine of \"benign neglect,\" smug in the belle! that for(cid:173)eigners had no alternative to taking in more dollars unless they would be willing to fur(cid:173)ther increase the value of their own curren(cid:173)cies, Which the United States stUl wanted them to do. The impact of devaluation on inflation caught Washington and most economists' by surprise, American economists tend to minimize the importance of foreign trade to the United States, since exports or 1m(cid:173)ports constitute less than 5 per cent of this country's gross national product. But the dollar devaluation, combined with expan(cid:173)sive fiscal and monetary policy, 1ntens1fted inflationary pressures which price controls could barely suppress. Devaluation spurred domestic inflation in the United States, certainly 1n the short run, by raising the dollar prices here of internationally traded goods, not only those of imports entering the United States but also, and more im(cid:173)portant, those of all exportable American goods as well. Many American products sud(cid:173)denly looked like a terrific bargain to for(cid:173)eigners, and they rushed to buy-beef in Chicago, oil in Baton Rouge and paintings at Sotheby Parke-Bernet Galleries in New Yor~. The impact on prices was dramatic. As Randall Hinshaw of Claremont Gradu(cid:173)ate School has found, the e1fect of devalua(cid:173)tion was immediate on primary products, such as food and raw materials, but more gradual on the prices of manufactured goods such as automobiles and tractors, especially under then existing price con(cid:173)trols. However, as the prices of such basic internationally traded raw-material \"in(cid:173)puts\" as iron and steel, copper, aluminum, zinc, lead and plastics have risen, so have the prices of autos, tractors and other man(cid:173)ufactured goods. And when price controls were lifted, the prices of industrial goods soared. Ironically, the devaluation of the dollar lnltially had a perverse e1fect on the United States balance of trade and payments. Economists had expected some lag, but it lasted longer than it was supposed to. Indeed, the dollar outflow quickened. The reason was the devaluation increased the dollar price of imports more than it re(cid:173)duced the volume of imports, especially as the American economy was expanding more rapidly and sucking 1n more imports. Simultaneously, devaluation cut the dol(cid:173)lar price of American exports, causing for(cid:173)eign demand for cheaper American goods to boom; but the United States imposed export controls on soybeans and other agri(cid:173)cultural goods, restricting the rise of its earnings abroad. Even more important, booming demand at home restricted the growth of United States exports. Hence the American trade position worsened in 1972, and dollars continued to flow over(cid:173)seas to cover the payments gap. The basic United States blunder was to think it could run a devaluation of the dollar without first slowing the economy. It did just ,the reverse-coupling devaluation with strong fiscal and monetary stimulus. The fixed-exchange-rate system could not survive the continuing dollar outflow. In early 1973, there was a second dollar devalua(cid:173)tion, amounting .to 10 per cent, following a dramatic around-the-world :fllght by Under secretary of the Treasury Paul Volcker. But instead of calming the foreign-exchange mar(cid:173)kets, it rolled them further. And in late 'February and early March, dollars began to flood into West Germany because the mark looked like the safest port in a storm. The German central 'bank took in over $3-blllion a day, paying out marks to all comers in a vain attempt to keep the mark's exchange rate from rising. After dishing out more than $10--blllion worth of marks, German monetary omcials finally grew frightened of inflation and threw in the. sponge. They stopped defending the fixed exchange rate \u2022between the dollar and the mark; so the mark floated upward, and the dollar floated downward. The Bretton Woods fixed-rate system was dead; the whole world monetary system was afloat. But 1nftation was anything but dead. The loss of respect for the dollar, the key currency of the world monetary system, \u00b7brought on a flight from al\u00b7l currencies into anything precious and scarce that would hold its value in a time of monetary crisis-gold, sUver, platinum and many other commodi(cid:173)ties. Overnight it seemed as though the Club of Rome's long-range forecasts of the ex(cid:173)haustion of world resources were coming true in a rush, !Wlth soaring prices the fever gauge of commodity shortages. !Accidents of nature fed the commodity in(cid:173)flation. One of the weirdest was the disap(cid:173)pearance of anchovies o1f the coast of Peru. Why this happened is still unclear. One theory is that the cause was the 1972-73 in(cid:173)vasion of a warm-water current called El Nino, which upset the ecology of the cold(cid:173)water Humboldt Current, drastically reduc(cid:173)ing the supply of plankton and other nu(cid:173)trients in which the anchovies feed. Most marine biologists doubt this, pointing out that El Nino comes roughly every seven years-it had last arrived in 1957 and 1962-but had not earlier \u2022seriously damaged the anchovy stock. Did an influx of predators eat the spawn? Were the young :flsh blown into hostUe waters? Nobody really knows. What(cid:173)ever the explanation, as \u00a5organ Guaranty Bank economists correctly stressed, Peru's anchovy catch fell from more than 10 mil(cid:173)lion tons to 2 million tons in 1973, wiping out a critical part of the world's :flshmeal supply, which is used to feed livestock. Bad growing weather for cereals, the !allure of much of the Soviet crop, the massive Soviet-American wheat deal-a key element in detente-exacerbated the commodlty in(cid:173)flation. But the over-an inflationary trend ",

In a strictly competitive sense, Ameri(cid:173)can industry and labor risk grave dangers if they do not thoroughly familiarize themselves with the nature of Soviet in(cid:173)dustry and the potential role our export policies may play in the future. On their own, the Marxist managers have never been able to produce nearly as effectively as the free nations because of their fail(cid:173)ure to provide proper incentives to stim(cid:173)ulate either ingenuity or industriousness. But by transferring the fruits of Ameri(cid:173)can creativity to the Soviet Union, we provide the rulers of the Kremlin with the capability of maintaining their mili(cid:173)tary-industrial complex at a level of pro(cid:173)duction which they could not attain within their own system. In the course of the debate today on the floor, each Mem(cid:173)ber of this body must ask whether he can honestly say to himself and the con(cid:173)stituents he represents that it is in the interest of the United States to either bail out the Soviet Union from their eco(cid:173)nomic ineptitude or to modernize their facilities which pose a direct threat to our own national security. The Soviet Union poses a potentially serious economic threat to the United States because of the nature of their . political system. While they have been enthusiastically accepting the benefits which our free enterprise system has made available, they have not reflected any disposition to increase the liberty of the people within their own country. As such they have maintained rigid ideo(cid:173)logical views of management and labor. Just as they suppress any political dis(cid:173)sidents in their country, so also they re(cid:173)fuse to consider workers as anything more than an economic resource. Whether they use the estimated 1 mil(cid:173)lion political prisoners directly in the Soviet factories or other Soviet citizens, the economic tsars in the Kremlin pro(cid:173)vide a kind of compensatio:1 that can only be characterized as slave labor. Conse(cid:173)quently when we transfer entire produc(cid:173)tive processes to the Communists, such as the Kama River truck plant nearing completion, we may find our own ma(cid:173)chines producing competitive products at a lower cost because of the drastic wage differential between our two countries. American workers, as with free workers throughout the world, are much more productive than those simply working for the benefit of the state. But since productivity is integrally related to the machinery which workers use, this effi(cid:173)ciency may be used against us when joined with a labor pool that survives at a subsistence level. The machinery we , supply the Russians may prove our un(cid:173)doing in future sales in international markets and therefore reduce our ex(cid:173)ports which will lead to a loss of Ameri(cid:173)can jobs. Probably an even greater danger to the United States than the potential competition of the Soviet Union is the use to which their newly acquired pro(cid:173)ductive processes may be directed. Al(cid:173)though we have had some additional cordial contact with the Soviet leaders and negotiated several agreements con-say that we shall not trade with any of the Soviet blo~ countries. It changes pol(cid:173)icy to say that we shall use our trade as a weapon in economic warfare and make that an expressed, open policy .. If the Members think this is not going to affect trade for agriculture and every(cid:173)thing else, they do not understand the complexities and interactions of trade. Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that we vote this down and give this matter the study and respect for the good of the Union which it deserves. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recog(cid:173)nizes the gentleman from Georgia <Mr. BLACKBURN) for 45 seconds. Mr. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I just want to address myself to one issue raised by the gentleman from Iowa <Mr. GRoss) as to whether agriculture is in(cid:173)cluded with respect to that committee. That particular committee is only in(cid:173)tended to concern itself with the export of technology and capital goods. That would not involve agricultural technology at all. My amendment Gontinues the existing language, which is a protection we voted for on behalf of the American farmer two years ago, and one which I think most of the people from the farm States are con-. cerned about. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recog(cid:173)nizes the gentleman from Ohio <Mr. ASHLEY) for 1 Y2 minutes to close debate. Mr. ASHLEY. Mr. Chairman, I cannot imagine a more deliberate affront that could be rendered by this body to Presi(cid:173)dent Ford than to adopt this amend(cid:173)ment. The President committed himself last night to continuing the foreign policy of the United States, a foreign policy which, under President Nixon, has engendered great pride, both in this country and throughout the world. If this amendment is adopted, what it is saying to the Communist countries is that it is no longer United States policy to trade with Poland, Yugoslavia, Czech(cid:173)oslovakia, Romania, and the Soviet Un(cid:173)ion. There will be no trade with these countries. That is what this amendment says. On page 2, line 6, it says-(1) in paragraph (1) thereof striking out 'countries with which we have diplomatic or trading relations, except those countries with which such trade has been determined by the President to be against the national in(cid:173)terest' and inserting 'market economy coun(cid:173)tries and friendly nations-except nonmar(cid:173)ket economy countries'. This is a deliberate slap at the Presi(cid:173)dent of the United States, and I should think that those who support it should be ashamed of themselves. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BLACKBURN) as a sub(cid:173)stitute for the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by the gentleman from California <Mr. HANNA). The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the noes ap(cid:173)peared to have it. RECORDED VOTE Mr. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The vote was taken by electronic de-cerning the limitation of armaments, the fact remains that the U.S.S.R. and her allies continue to represent the only significant threat to our own national security in the world today. In recogni(cid:173)tion of that threat, the House has just passed last week the largest defense budget in our history. The Communist leaders, whether in Moscow, Peking or elsewhere, have never abandoned their own ideals or aspirations which clash directly in almost all important respects with our own basic commitments. There(cid:173)fore, to provide the nearly unlimited flow of technological assistance to the Soviet Union, which is what our trade policy has degenerated into, we build up the very nation which directly threatens us. The direction the Soviet rulers con(cid:173)tinue to push their economy in is obvious in several recent reports. The Christian Science Monitor on July 24, 1974 pointed out that even-Pravda disclosed that the output of con(cid:173)sumer goods in some of the largest enter(cid:173)prises of Ukrainian heavy industry amounted to less than one percent of the total. Where the Soviets are directing their industry is evident in their continually escalating military spending and unlike the United States they do not have to allocate as much of their defense budget to manpower. The August 5, 1974 edition of Newsweek reports that the military budget of the Soviet Union will steadily rise to $93 billion by 1975 while that of the United States is expected to be ap(cid:173)proximately $86 billion that same year. The report notes-The bulk of. the Soviet increase will go to replace existing ICBM's and to develop a new generation of missiles for future use. Those new missiles can only be re(cid:173)garded as threatening our own security. Yet without the passage of this legisla(cid:173)tion we will continue to export to the Soviet Union precision ball bearing grinding machines, computer technology and other ingredients that are vit~l in the production of modern weapons of war. If we had had the restrictions con(cid:173)tained in the National Protection Act several years ago we probably now would not have to be spending as much money as we are now on our national defense. But by transferring military technologi(cid:173)cal assistance through alleged peaceful trade, we have contributed to the Soviet development of MIRV's and thereby necessitated greater outlays by ourselves to counter a growing Soviet strategic threat. The Soviet consumer has not benefited from this trade policy and ob-. viously the American taxpayer and bor(cid:173)rower have suffered as well. With the passage of this legislation we can and must bring an abrupt halt to this inde\u00b7 fensible export policy. <By unanimous consent Mr. FoLEY yielded his time to Mr. HANNA.) The CHAIRMAN.

            "954": "28274 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE August 14, 197 4 thls tion to closing charges, and attempt to pro(cid:173)tect individual borrowers from having to pay more for a particular service than 1s generally customary in the local area in(cid:173)volved. The committee believes thSit practice should be continued and that pro(cid:173)cedures should be developed to provide help(cid:173)ful information about such charges to pro(cid:173)spective borrowers along the lines discussed above in connection with information on borrowing costs. It is the committee's intent that the study and recommendations on settlement costs cover not only Government-assisted mort(cid:173)gage transactions but also all residential real estate tTansactions, with particular ref(cid:173)erence to those transactions involving single(cid:173)family homes where the unsophisticated pur(cid:173)chaser or seller 1s often unfamiliar with the complex detaUs of transferring real estate title. It 1s hoped that a thorough study will be made toward developing a simplified method of locally controlled recording and guaranteeing of real estate titles to speed up and reduce the costs of title transfers. Senator Brock argues that the statutory language means that the Congress simply intended that FHA and VA continue their existing administrative practice of reviewing particular transactions to ensure that the closing charges are reasonable and customary for the local area involved. This interpreta(cid:173)tion cannot possibly be sustained by a care(cid:173)ful reading of the statute and the legislative history. First, it is obvious that the phrase \"prescribe standards governing the amounts of settlement costs allowable\" contemplates the issuance of regulations to limit settle(cid:173)ment costs. \"Prescribing standards\" goes well beyond HUD's or VA's present practice of reviewing partircular transactions to ensure that they are \"reasonl8ible and customary\". Second, if all Congress intended was to au(cid:173)thorize HUD and VA to continue their exist(cid:173)ing administrative practice to review particu(cid:173)lar transactions to ensure that closing charges were reaso!liable and customary, why did Congress pass section 701 (a) at all? Senator Brock himself acknowledges in his April 29 letter that this practice does not require specific statutory aUJthoriza.tion. Third, the Committee Reports of both the Senate and House clearly indicate th8.t Con(cid:173)gress intended that standards be prescribed and that HUD and VA continue their exist(cid:173)ing practice of reviewing particular trans(cid:173)actions to ensure charges were reasonable and customary. The first paragraph of the Sena.te Report talks about the leg1alation directing HUD and VA to prescribe standards. The fifth paragraph refers to the existing practice of HUD and VA with respect tore(cid:173)viewing particular transactions to ensure that charges were generally customary in the local area involved, and expresses the Com(cid:173)mittee's wish that these practices be con(cid:173)tinued. If the Committee only intended the fifth paragraph of its Report to apply, as Senator Brock contends, then what is the purpose of the first paragraph indicating that HUD and VA are directed to prescribe standards? B. The Brock bill does not respond to all of the recomendations of the HUD-VA study 3164, Senator Brock contends that his bill, S. is \"directly responsive to all of the recommendations for Federal legislative ac(cid:173)tion to reduce settlement costs contained in the 1972 HUD-VA Report.\" (Italic by Senator Brock) Actually, the HUD-VA Report did not make any recommendations for additional Federal legislation. Instead, the Report contained a number of proposals for administrative implementation under the authority of Section 701 as well as other authorities. The first recommendation of the Report was the establishment of maximum allowable settlement costs for identifiable housing market areas by HUD and v A. This authority would be repealed by the Brock b1ll. Thus, it is not correct to say .that the Brock bill responds to all of the recom(cid:173)mendations in the HUD-VA report. The recommendations of the HUD-VA study are as follows: A. Immediate action at the Federal level 1. HUD and VA wUI establish maximum allowable charges for all individual settle(cid:173)ment cost items paid by both the buyer and seller, except loan discount payments and costs fixed by State and local statutes, for identifiable housing market areas. Govern(cid:173)ment insurance or guarantee will not be is(cid:173)sued in any case in which charges exceed any one of the maximums. 2. Other Proposals Designed To Reduce and Standardize Settlement Costs. (a) HUD and VA will require the use of a single uniform settlement statement for all HUD and VA insured or guaranteed trans(cid:173)actions (except loans on mobile homes). This statement will separately itemize buyer and seller costs in order to provide full disclosure and assure that costs reported were actually incurred. Sworn a.tndavits and certifications will be obtained indicating that each party participating in the transaction or his repre(cid:173)sentative has not received or paid a fee not explicitly authorized by HUD or VA. The statement will also reflect such infor(cid:173)mation as will insure that the homebuyer shall have been afforded the maximum econ(cid:173)omies obtainable through reissue rates for title insurance. (b) HUD and VA wlll require that buyers and sellers receive detailed estimates of prob(cid:173)able individual settlement costs which are ap(cid:173)plicable to the transaction. If title insurance is to be used, a further explanation wlll be required informing the buyer that the mortgagee's title insurance policy protects the lender's interest and an owner's policy, which protects the buyer's interest 1s available at an additional cost. (c) The HUD Office of Audit will under(cid:173)take an audit of selected mortgagees with a view toward providing additional data needed to establish appropriate limits on lender's origination fees and validating data concern(cid:173)ing such fees. ' '(d) HUD and VA wlll require that initial deposits in the mortgagee's escrow account should be collected so that when the tax blll is paid, only 1/12 of the estimated annual tax bill remains in the escrow account; pro(cid:173)vided that monthly payment to the mortga(cid:173)gee includes an amount for real estate taxes which represents 1/12 of the annual tax. Both agencies further intend to keep all escrow de(cid:173)posits at a minimum. (e) HUD and VA will continue to prohibit mortgagees from charging the buyer a fee for the preparation of Truth-in-Lending statements and recommend that the Con(cid:173)gress enact legislation prohibiting all fees for the preparation of disclosure statements. (f) It is proposed that a federally spon(cid:173)sored, computerized land parcel recording system be authorized and funded in selected jurisdictions throughout the country, with a view toward the development of a uniform nationwide system which wUI simplify pro:. cedures and result in reduced costs. II. REASONS WHY THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE CLOS~G COSTS SHOULD BE RETAINED A. Additional hearings needed Congress should not make a final decision on the question of regul1ating closing charges until it holds additional hearings on the sub(cid:173)ject and on alternative methods for reducing excessive closing charges. There are three principal approaches for dealing with the closing cost probl~m. These are: Disclosure and anti-kickback (Brock blll, S. 3164) only. (1) (Proxmire ( 2) Direct regulation of charges ( Proxmire bill, s. 2288) (3) Requiring lenders to pay. blll, s. 3232) . The Committee has not really heard from consumer representatives or independent ex(cid:173)perts with respect to the closing cost issue or to the alternative methods for reducing excessive charges. Only two witnesses on the consumer side testified before the Commit(cid:173)tee, and their testimony was delivered on short notice and buried in the general testi(cid:173)mony taken on the omnibus 1973 housing bill. Recent testimony before the House Banking Committee indicates that con(cid:173)sumer organizations may be shifting their position in favor of requiring the lender to pay closing charges as an alterna(cid:173)tive to price regulation. The Senate Banking Committee should obtain the benefit of these views before it makes a final decision on the price regulation issue. B. Authority needed as a club in the closet Until Congress does make a final decision on the best method for reducing closing charges, the existing regulatory authority under Section 701 should be kept on the books as an effective deterrent. The prema(cid:173)ture repeal of this authority can weaken the incentive of the States to reform closing cost practices and can encourage those who provide settlement services to increase their charges. If the mere retention of Section 701 has no deterrent value, then why is the real estate settlement industry so anxious for its immediate repeal? The industry itself has testified that HUD has no immediate inten(cid:173)tion of limiting closing costs by regulation. What harm would be done if the authority is retained on the books for another few months while Congress holds hearings and gives further consideration to the matter? m. WHY THE BROCK BILL SHOULD BE DEFEATED IF SECTION 10 (C) IS RETAINED If Section 10 (c) of the Brock bill is re(cid:173)tained, the benefits to consumers from the disclosure and other provisions of the bill would be overwhelmingly offset by the in(cid:173)crease in closing charges which would be triggered by the premature repeal of HUD's regulatory authority. One method for testing the validity of fuis judgment is to look at who supports and who opposes the Brock bill. During recent hearings held by the House Banking Committee, 18 representatives of bar associations, title insurance companies, realtors, mo~ge lenders, and other pro(cid:173)viders of settlement services testified. All 18 supported the Stephens blll which is quite similar to the Brock bill. On the other hand, 7 consumer spokesmen or independent e\u00b7x(cid:173)perts testified on the closing cost issue. Not one of the seven supported the approach taken by the Stephens b111. If the Brock(cid:173)Stephens bill confers such great benefits on consumers, why have consumer organiza(cid:173)tions not come forward to support this bill? As a practical matter, consumers would gain very little from the Brock bill. Most of the disclosure provisions in the bill are al(cid:173)ready included in a bill passed by the Sen(cid:173)ate last year, the Fair Credit Billing Act, S. 2101. Moreover, many of the reforms pro(cid:173)posed could be carried out administratively by HUD and other Federal housing agencies. In its Report on Settlement Costs, HUD and VA have already announced their intentions to administratively implement almost all of the reforms in the Brock bill with respect to FHA-VA transactions. Similar regulations with respect to conventional mortgage trans(cid:173)actions could and undoubtedly would be is(cid:173)sued by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corpora(cid:173)tion, and the Federal National Mortgage As(cid:173)sociation. Thus, the benefits to consumers in the Brock blll are largely cosmetic and would ",
            "1004": "28324 ber once represented about 200 people, to(cid:173)day each board member must speak for ap(cid:173)proximately 3,000 constitutents. The variation around this mean is wide, and in cities such as New York and Los An(cid:173)geles, each trustee must translate the will of literally millions of his fellow laymen. In general, school board members are now but a minuscule group relative to the size of their constituency, students, and staff. Their abllity to sense and articulate the values and desires of their constituents, and translate them into policy, has correspondingly dwindled. DEPOLITICIZATION, BUREAUCRATIZATION, AND UNIONIZATION Turn-of-the-century governmental re(cid:173)formers believed strongly that political ma(cid:173)chines, bossism, and local corruption were caused by an excess of democracy. By per(cid:173)mitting cities to be organized on the basis of subunits and wards, unscrupulous poli(cid:173)ticians had too many opportunities to rise to power. The answer was to centralize many governmental functions into city wide sys(cid:173)tems. Thus the reformers hoped to attract higher caliber public servants by increasing the visibility, responsibility, and honor at(cid:173)tached to public service. In large measure, for municipal services, these reform efforts were successful. Education in particular was to be insulated from partisan politics. Ward school districts gave way to centralized city school boards that were held separate from city councils, the mayor's office, or other bodies of gen(cid:173)eral government. Schools were to have their own special government outside the sphere of politics. Further, separate election procedures and qualifications were established for school board members. In many places, school trustee candidates were prohibited from running as members of a political party. Fur(cid:173)thermore, school board elections were moved to \"off years\" and \"off months\" so as not to coincide with other elections. In addition, school boards were given their own taxing power, presumably free from even the slight(cid:173)est taint of partisanship. THE BUSINESS MODEL To ensure further that schools were not tied to petty political wheeling and dealing, reformers advocated the appointment of \"professional\" school managers, trained ex(cid:173)perts in the operation of schools. Schools were to model themselves after businesses. All decisions were to be based on expert managerial judgment, and managers were to meet criteria of efficiency and productivity. Once they had evolved broad \"corporate strategy,\" school board members wert:. not supposed to interfere in the running of schools any more than a group of stock(cid:173)holders or business board members would think of telling a plant foreman or manager how to fix a broken machine. The new ideol(cid:173)ogy drew a line between policy setting and administration, and laymen were not to cross over into the sacred, politically sanitized realm of professional school administration. As enrollment increased, the idea of a cadre of trained professional school adminis(cid:173)trators was attractive for several reasons. The growth of cities combined with the elimina(cid:173)tion of many small, ward-based city districts, meant that school board members could no longer act as executive officers. Control prob(cid:173)lems had simply begun to exceed their man(cid:173)agerial grasp, and it made good sense for professionals to run the school in accord with board-established policies. EXPANSION OF STAFF As numbers of students increased, num(cid:173)bers of teachers, counselors, and other em(cid:173)ployees increased as well. Such expanded staffs demanded, in turn, more school ad(cid:173)ministrators. Thus, there began to evolve a EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS bureaucracy of school professionals whos~ ostensible function was to translate board(cid:173)determined policy into the details of educa(cid:173)tional practice. One outcome was the inter(cid:173)position of several layers between school board members and the classroom teacher. Such bureaucratic entities include, for ex(cid:173)ample the superintendent of schools, his immediate staff, and assorted other \"central office\" personnel concerned with accounting, supplies, curriculum coordination and per(cid:173)sonnel matters. On individual school sites, the administrative hierarchy may consist of a principal and several intermediaries above the level of teachers and students. ALIENATION OF TEACHERS Bureaucracy and bigness have not only re(cid:173)duced the potency of public policy makers, but also severely curtailed teachers' feelings of efficacy. As school systeins grew and came under the dominance of expert managers, teachers lost their ab111ty to communicate freely with their employers, school trustees or even with the superintendent and his staff. In most schools, the principal was still available to teachers, but his power had be(cid:173)come so severely eroded that he was seldom able to comply with a teacher's request or resolve grievances. The frustration was heightened as city schools became more pop(cid:173)ulated by children from low income house(cid:173)holds and minority groups whose back(cid:173)grounds and values were frequently at odds with those of middle-class teachers. Under such circumstances, teacher alienation be(cid:173)came more real and more intense. Who would hear the teacher's voice? How could teachers begin to participate in the decisions that affected them so immediately? The answer was \"unions,\" or unions under a different name. By banding together. threatening to withhold their services and to engage in collective bargaining, teachers became a potent force. Public sector bargain(cid:173)ing is frequently 1llegal, and almost no(cid:173)where are teachers granted the statutory authority to strike. Nevertheless, teachers do bargain and, on occasion, strike. The out(cid:173)come has frequently been complicated by sets of contracts that specify working con(cid:173)ditions, transfer procedures, pay, hours of work and classroom duties. Whereas they were once relatively voiceless vassals, teach(cid:173)ers' organizational spokesmen frequently are as powerful now as a district's professional administrators. A big city board could not conceivably enact and implement a new policy without the consent of teacher spokes(cid:173)men. In effect, teachers have been accorded veto power over school board policy making. The rise in \"teacher power\" occurred after World War II, when many middle class citi(cid:173)zens were moving from cities to suburbs, and minorities in the cities had not yet achieved a high degree of political awareness. Con(cid:173)sequently, a political power vacuum was cre(cid:173)ated into which teachers moved. Their as(cid:173)cendancy was aided by the very reforms that in an earlier era had beeri designed to limit citizen participation and to improve the schools. PUBLIC'S DWINDLING VOICE By the beginning of the 1960's, with the efforts at depoliticization, the growth of ad(cid:173)ministrative bureaucracies, and the escala(cid:173)tion of teacher power, the public's ability to express its wlll regarding school policy had become badly diminished. What difference has it made that lay decision makers now have substantially less authority than they once had? Answers are difficult. There are so few indicators of how schools are performing that it is hard to know if they are doing a better or worse job today than previously. The absence of base(cid:173)line indicators and a commonly accepted measure is itself symptomatic of the prob(cid:173)lem. Professional educators have steadfastly resisted means by which school productivity could be measured. Teachers and adminis-August 14, 197 4 trators have rightly recognized that the measurement of school outputs would be a strong lever by which lay policy makers could recapture control of school operation. SCHOOLS IN MONOPOLIES School costs provide one of the few avail(cid:173)able measures of citizens impotence in policy setting. In private sector bargaining, both sides realize that if a wage settlement is so high as to render a manufactured product uncompetitive, it will cost management profits and labor jobs. No such market pres(cid:173)sures exist in public sector bargaining. Schools are in effect monopolies whose cus(cid:173)tomers are guaranteed by compulsory at(cid:173)tendance laws. Consequently, educational personnel costs have incxeased faster than overall economic growth and faster than comparable occupations. Moreover, as sug(cid:173)gested earlier, few if any gains in productiv(cid:173)ity have accompanied such salary increases. UNIFORMITY AND STANDARDIZATION An additional price of depoliticization ap(cid:173)pears to halve been uniformity. Under the aegis of professionals, teachers and adminis(cid:173)trators, schools have become standardized to a remarkable, some say oppressive, degree. Seldom do schools admit to the real diversity of tastes and values among their clients. If a large body of technical knowledge existed to support the rigid prescription of professional behavior, then the exclusion of lay voices regarding the nature of schooling might be better justified. However, in the absence of such scientific underpinnings for schooling, it would seem more reasonable, and ultimately more productive, to permit wider choice in the styles, modes of opera(cid:173)tion, and instructional strategies of schools. The promotion of conflict appears to be another consequence of the erosion of lay control. Parents' and other citizens' inability to make their wishes heard provides an in(cid:173)centive to aggregate demands until com(cid:173)plaints are sufficiently loud and pressing to be heard. Moreover, because individual teach(cid:173)ers and administrators frequently have no power to alter the situation, it may be neces(cid:173)sary to escalate the demand all the way to the school board in order to have it acted upon. Small wonder that the media increas(cid:173)ingly portray parents petitioning and picket(cid:173)ing board members. Citizens fear that they will go unnoticed otherwise. WHAT CAN BE DONE? Though by no means a revolution, there is a substantial hint of reform in the air. Many of these change efforts show promise of taking root and appear worthy of careful scrutiny by policy makers. These changes are characterized by two basic features. First, an effort has been made to reduce the size or redefine the basic management unit of schooling so as to restore personal contact and clarify who is responsible for what. Sec(cid:173)ond, lay participation has been increased either by injecting an element of the market place into school decisions or by enlarging the number of citizens who determine how schools should be operated. Examples of such reforms are to be found in every region of the United States. Because space does not permit a detailed descrip(cid:173)tion of each, we will concentraJte on two of the more interesting illustrations: a. \"Voucher\" e~periment in Alum Rock, Cali(cid:173)fornia and School Site Governance in Florida.

The Chair now recognizes the gentle(cid:173)man from Texas (Mr. PATMAN) . (Mr. \u00b7PATMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present to the House this con(cid:173)ference report which represents a great victory for the House conferees. There were some 21 meetings of the conferees on this bill over the past month attempt(cid:173)ing to do the difficult job of reconciling some 370 items in disagreement. The conference report contains the new community development block grant program, a new housing assistance pro(cid:173)gram, increase in the FHA mortgage limits, liberalizing of FHA downpayment requirements, strengthening of our rural housing programs, additional funding for the 701 planning program, and liberaliz(cid:173)ing of the real estate lending authorities of Federal savings and loan associations and national banks. Mr. Speaker, the conference on this bill, as I have previously stated, was a long and difficult one. I would like to commend all of the House conferees for their patience and persistence in seeking to develop a bill which would meet with the approval of the House. I believe that this housing and com(cid:173)munity development bill is one of the finest housing bills that has been pre(cid:173)sented to the House, and I would, at this point, yield such time as he may con(cid:173)sume to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr .. BARRETT), the chairman of the Housing Subcommittee, to explain the major provisions of the conference report. Mr. BARRETT. Mr. Speaker, the con(cid:173)ference report on S. 3066, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, is the result of a long series of meetings held by House and Senate con(cid:173)ferees over the past several weeks on a most important and far-reaching bill. Although both the House-and Senate(cid:173)passed bills dealt with similar HUD pro(cid:173)grams, there were in fact great differ(cid:173)ences in approach between the two bills. The conferees dealt with more than 300 substantive differences between the two bills, and I believe that the resolution of these differences was as fair and equi(cid:173)table to both Houses as was humanly possible. In this statement, I would like to out(cid:173)line the major areas of difference be(cid:173)tween the House and Senate bills and briefly explain how these issues were resolved. TITLE I-cO:MMUNITY DEVELOPMENT Both the Senate and House bills con(cid:173)solidated a number of HUD categorical programs providing community develop(cid:173)ment assistance to large and small com(cid:173)munities\u00b7 throughout the country. Both bills established a system of grant en(cid:173)titlements-the Senate bill generally through a \"hold-harmless\" approach, under which communities would have been assured of a certain level of funding annually; the House bill through a rela(cid:173)tively complex formula-based on popu(cid:173)lation poverty counted twice, and hous(cid:173)ing ov~rcrowding-accompanied by hold(cid:173)harmless provisions generally similar to the Senate bill. The conferees accepted the House ap .. proach with a modification in the treat(cid:173)ment of the \"model cities\" component of the \"hold-harmless provisions. Under the conference bill, model cities grant recipients will receive a declining per(cid:173)\u00b7centage-80, 60, and 40 percent-of their average annual grant under the model cities program for a 3-year period fol(cid:173)lowing completion of the community's fifth action year. Th9 conferees believe that this resolution of the model cities issue is fair both to the 147 model cities communities and to the many communi(cid:173)ties throughout the country which must be assured reasonable access to commu(cid:173)nity development funds. Both the Senate and House bills con(cid:173)tained provisions designed to assure that communities would utilize block grant funds to address high priority national goals and objectives. Although the spe(cid:173)cific provisions of the two bills differed in significant ways, the thrust of both bills was clearly to channel community development funds toward long-estab(cid:173)lished and identified national goals. The conference report merged these differing provisions to clarify this intent. Each community applying for block grant funds must-First, identify its community develop(cid:173)ment needs and objectives in accordance with areawide development planning and national urban growth policy; Second, formulate a program of ac(cid:173)tivities to meet those needs, together with estimated costs and general lo(cid:173)cation of such activities; and Third, submit a housing assistance plan (surveying the housing needs of lower-income persons, specifying the number of units or persons to be assisted including the proportion of new, reha(cid:173)bilitated, or existing units, and indicat(cid:173)ing the general location of housing for lower-income persons; and Fourth, describe a program of activi(cid:173)ties designed to eliminate or prevent slums, blight, and deterioration where such conditions or needs exist; and to provide improved community facilities and supporting health, social and simi(cid:173)lar services where necessary and appro(cid:173)priate. The Senate bill authorized $2.8 billion in fiscal year 1975 and $3.3 billion in fiscal year 1975, $2.65 billion in fiscal year 1976, and $2.95 billion in fiscal year 1977, with additional special transition grants of $100 million annually for the above fiscal years. The conference bill authorizes $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1975, $2.95 billion in fiscal year 1976, and $2.95 billion in fiscal year 1977, with special transition grants of $50 million annually for the first 2 fiscal years and $100 million for the third fiscal year. The conferees believe that these au(cid:173)thorization amounts are reasonable and necessary to continue and expand com(cid:173)munity development activities through(cid:173)out the country.

I com(cid:173)mend her for her efforts. Mr. HARSHA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman for accept(cid:173)ing the amendment. I would like to close by saying here that most Federal projects are required to file such statements, and I see no rea(cid:173)son why these public mass transporta(cid:173)tion projects should not be controlled by the National Environmental Policy Act. Ms. ABZUG. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike out the last word. Ms. ABZUG. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend Mr. HARSHA for bringing this amendment to strike out section 506, the provision exempting projects funded under this act from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and which directs the Secretary of Transportation to assume those func(cid:173)tions. I also want to compliment the chairman of my committee, Mr. BLATNIK, for accepting this amendment. This is the amendment that was originally made by me in committee and was defeate~. It is also the subject of supplemental v1ews in the report accompanying this legisla(cid:173)tion signed by myself together with my colleagues Messrs HOWARD, RoE, VANDER VEEN, and TRAXLER. I include those SUP(cid:173)plemental views to indicate the reasons I originally brought this amendment and why myself and my colleagues support this amendment: SUPPLEMENTAL VIEWS OF REPRESENTATIVES .ABZUG, HOWARD, ROE, VANDERVEEN, TRAXLER Section 506 of the proposed legislation in(cid:173)cludes a provision exempting projects funded under the Act from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, includ(cid:173)ing the preparation and circulation of en(cid:173)vironmental impact statements on major actions significantly affecting the environ(cid:173)ment. Instead, Section. 506(b) directs the !Secretary of Transportation to assure that certain environmental, economic, and social effects of the project have been considered. This approach is unnecessary, unwise, un(cid:173)workable, and a dangerous precedent for the Committee to set. . It is unnecessary because no case can be made that environmental impact statements have caused delays in the implementation of the program. According to the records of the Council on Environmental Quality, which is given the responsibllity to oversee implementation of the Act, the total number of actions to which UMTA has filed impact statements in the last 4Y:z years is nine. That comes out to 2 impact statements a year. That is hardly an administrative burden, and in fact raises a question about whether or not UMTA is really meeting its responsi(cid:173)blllties under the Act to any significant degree. Some have argued that NEPA has delayed UMTA projects. To the degree this is true, it seems to us the problem lies not with impact statements, but with internal administrative delays blamed on alleged en(cid:173)vironmental reviews that the public never sees. The answer to this is improved internal procedures, and perhaps an investigation by this Committee into what is really the cause of these delays. Exempting the program from the major external review of environmental impacts available to the public does not seem a well-directed response by this Com(cid:173)mittee. The approach is unwise because it ignores the value of open review with agencies and the public of alternative transit plans and prograins available to localities throughout the country. The debate over how to provide for future transit needs is really just begin(cid:173)ning in many cities. Among the options most have to consider are use of existing rail sys(cid:173)teins, new rail systems, bus routes, expanded bus service, and other special services. The decision among these alternatives is one in which the public should have a say. Thus, it is the spirit of our proposed legislation to take the decision away from Washington and the vagaries of the Office of Management and Budget and to put it where it belongs with the people. The NEPA process, includ(cid:173)ing the use of environmental impact state(cid:173)ments, can be a useful tool in doing this. If we exempt these projects from NEPA, we have in effect chosen to replace what by law is required to be a straightforward consider(cid:173)ation of alternatives with a set of slick pro(cid:173)motional displays put together for presenta(cid:173)tion to the community by the proponents of one system over another. The approach is unworkable because it seeks to substitute a vague procedure of ad(cid:173)ministrative findings of environmental ef(cid:173)fects by the Secretary of Transportation for the well-established and widely understood requirements of NEPA. Several hundred court cases have in the past four years made reasonably clear what is required in an im(cid:173)pact statement, and the process is evolving and maturing into an important new tool for the public to use to hold accountable their public officials. To substitute the sub(cid:173)jective and vague language of Section 506 (a) and (b) for this set of well-established standards simply means we will need to spend the next five years litigating what the Con(cid:173)gress meant for the Secretary to do. Finally, the approach is a dangerous prece(cid:173)dent. There has not yet been a broad exemp(cid:173)tion from NEPA like this applied to any public works program by this or any other Committee of the Congress. Even at the height of the energy crisis, cooler heads pre(cid:173)vailed and NEP A reviews, while modified to take account of emergency measures re(cid:173)quired, were kept intact. To write this ex(cid:173)emption for a program that sorely needs the kind of public overview of alternatives that NEPA requires seems particularly inappro(cid:173)priate. It is the foot in the door for the exemption of environmental reviews of other public worlcs projects. Before long we could well see this precedent applied to highways, water resource projects, sewer programs, and every other major construction program funded by the Federal government. Transportation plans must be made with an eye to the future and must be rigorously scrutinized as to the impact of a system on all elements of a community's socio-economic and environmental needs. To exempt the projects under this bill from NEPA will seriously weaken the entire transportation planning process. This is a serious flaw in an otherwise landmark piece of legislation(cid:173)a significant first step in the history of public mass transportation. Agreed to supplemental views: B'ELLA S. ABZUG, JAMES J. HOWARD. ROBERT A. ROE. RICHARD F. VANDERVEEN. BOB TRAXLER. Mr. STUDDS. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. ABZUG. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. STUDDS. I appreciate the gentle(cid:173)woman's yielding. Mr. Chairman, I fully support this amendment. At the same time, I think that the record ought to reflect that this Member is not-and I suspect a great many other Members are not-at all happy with the lack of expeditious con(cid:173)sideration of the environmental impact requirements by the Department of Transportation, particularly by UMT A. Mass transit projects are in and of them(cid:173)selves environmental pluses. It is ironic and, I think, unfortunate that in many cases-and in Massachusetts we have a glaring example of this-efforts positive(cid:173)ly to improve the environment have been delayed in the very process of attempt(cid:173)ing to assess their environmental im(cid:173)pact. I fully support the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio, and I am delighted that he offered it. I think it would be a serious mistake in this or any other major piece of legislation to over(cid:173)ride the National Environmental Policy Act. At the same time, this Member wants to go on record as strongly de(cid:173)siring that the Urban Mass Transit Ad(cid:173)ministration proceed with a good deal more speed than it has in the past in ex(cid:173)pediting projects which are designed pos(cid:173)itively, explicitly, in and of themselves, to improve the environment of this Nation.

            "1154": "28474 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE August 15, 197 .q. that group is probably affected dispro(cid:173)portionately. Furthermore, a cashout only of SSI recipients would create situa(cid:173)tions in which they are ineligible for food stamps even though others with higher incomes remain eligible. Such a cashout would also create serious admin(cid:173)istrative difficulties in cases where the SSI recipient lives in a household with others who may be eligible for food stamps. Such cases might e\u00b7ven include many husband and wife situations. These problems led me to conclude, reluctantly, that as long as there is a food stamp program there will be serious problems inherent in mandatory cash(cid:173)out only of SSI recipients. Thus, I am proposing instead that SSI be considered in the same fashion as any other income for purposes of determining food stamp eligibility. An exception would be made under my language in the bill, however, to allow those SSI recipients who are depending on food stamps at the time of enactment and who receive them based solely on their SSI eligibility rather than their income to retain the auto(cid:173)matic food stamp eligibility of their household. This arrangement would pre(cid:173)vent about one-fourth of the SSI recipi(cid:173)ents from losing their eligibility for food stamps, while still establishing the prin(cid:173)ciple that food stamp eligibility should be determined based solely on income, regardless of source. My bill also incorporates other nec(cid:173)essary changes to the Food Stamp Act, proposed by the administration, which will affect some SSI recipients. These changes classify groups of unrelated in(cid:173)dividuals living together as economic units under the food stamp definition of \"households\" in accordance with a re(cid:173)cent Supreme Court ruling, restore cer(cid:173)tain provisions which were in the Food Stamp Act at one time, but have been delete,9. and make clear that SSI recipi(cid:173)ents in the five cashout States, who are now categorically ineligible for food stamps, would become eligible for food stamps if their incomes warrant, under the terms of the bill. Section 6 of the bill would reduce from 6 months to 2 months the time art elderly couple must live apart before they are each considered eligible individuals for the purpose of receiving supplemental security income benefits. In the interest of saving bureaucrats the work of deter(cid:173)mining whether a couple has actually separated, present law simply requires that they be paid as if they were living together for the first 6 months that they maintain separate residences. Each per(cid:173)son thus receives 25 percent less than the amount which would be available to \"eli(cid:173)gible individuals,\" even though each may have to bear the expenses of an in(cid:173)dividual household. It is certainly true that administra(cid:173)tive difficulties would arise from a re(cid:173)quirement that the Social Security Ad(cid:173)ministration constantly determine whether couples who have just moved apart have actually changed their living patterns. It is also true that such a re(cid:173)quirement might in itself cause tempo(cid:173)rary aberrations in these living patterns, which could abuse the program and com(cid:173)plicate the administrative task further. However, the present 6-month \"penalty period\" is definitely excessive. Two months is long enough to make the ad(cid:173)ministrative task easier and to discour(cid:173)age abuses of the program. The present inadequacy of the legal safeguards surrounding use in the SSI program of \"representative payees,\" to which benefits are paid on behalf of some SSI recipients is addressed by the next two sectiops of the bill. Section 7 modifies the inflexible statu(cid:173)tory requirement that any disabled re(cid:173)cipient who, in addition to any other infirmities, may also suffer from alco(cid:173)holism or drug addiction, must have his SSI payments made through a repre(cid:173)sentative payee. It amends that provi(cid:173)sion to allow for a waiver of this re(cid:173)quirement when the SSI recipient is re(cid:173)ceiving rehabilitation treatment and when the chief medical or supervisory officer of the treatment facility certifies in writing that direct payment to the re(cid:173)cipient would have therapeutic value to him or her and that there is substantial reason to believe that the recipient would not misuse the SSI payments. This change is necessary to assist rehabilita(cid:173)tion facilities in achieving full rehabili(cid:173)tation of their patients. Present law also gives the Secretary the authority to require a representative payee for any SSI recipient, whenever he deems it appropriate. A glaring legal de(cid:173)ficiency of the present program is the lack of any provision for the recipient to appeal the designation of a repre(cid:173)sentative payee, or the choice of any spe(cid:173)cific payee. My legislation, in section 8, would remedy that deficiency. Section 9 of the bill would put into SSI law the same deadlines for action on approval of applications which were re(cid:173)quired under the welfare programs re(cid:173)placed by SSI. It does not seem unrea(cid:173)sonable to require the Social Security Administration to meet the same dead(cid:173)lines that the States and counties learned to live with. My provision also adds a requirement that decisions on presump(cid:173)tive eligibility for benefits, on the basis of disability, be made within 20 days of application. These deadlines apply, of course, from the time the application is completed and filed. Another section of the bill which deals w~th the legal rights of SSI recipients is section 10. Any actual determination made by the Secretary of Health, Educa(cid:173)tion, and Welfare, after a hearing under the SSI program, would be made subject to judicial review in the same manner and to the same extent as the corre(cid:173)sponding determinations made by the Secretary under the. social se.curity program. Section 11 of the bill clears up a minor problem in the definition of income for the purpose of calculating SSI benefits. It makes clear that grants, scholarships, and fellowships received to pay for books, supplies, services, and other expenses re(cid:173)lated solely to attendance in an educa(cid:173)tional institution may not be counted as income and thus deducted from the SSI benefit. Section 12 of the bill amends the so(cid:173)cial services provisions of the Social Security Act, to insure that individuals whose social services benefits are re.: duced or cut off will have the oppor-tunity for a fair hearing. It simply rec(cid:173)ognizes that the changeover to SSI has caused distortions and changes in the assistance offered through other pro(cid:173)grams, and insures that affected individ(cid:173)uals will have the opportunity to state their cases. The proposed authority is similar to that which is already included in the supplemental security income pro(cid:173)gram itself. The last section of my bill deals with a problem of particular importance to my Ohio constituents, although there cer(cid:173)tainly must be many aged, blind, and dis(cid:173)abled persons in other States who are af(cid:173)fected by the same problem. As I men(cid:173)tioned in my testimony last month, the prohibition in present law of SSI pay(cid:173)ments to inmates of public institutions, unless the institutions meet medicaid standards, is certainly having a dispro(cid:173)portionate effect upon Ohio. In the first few months, there were many State-licensed but privately con(cid:173)trolled institutions that had been under the impression that they were being classified as public, and they were re(cid:173)ceiving different signals from the dis(cid:173)trict and national social security offices. Although this mixup apparently has been cleared up, there are still charges at the State level that the public institu(cid:173)tions prohibition is being applied un(cid:173)necessarily broadly and discriminatorily. Probably the most widespread effect of the provision in Ohio, however, is its elimination from SSI of about 1,500 resi(cid:173)dents of the 54 of Ohio's 66 county homes which presently do not meet medicaid standards. Many of these fa(cid:173)cilities are primarily residential, and I believe that serious questions can be raised about applying the public institu(cid:173)tions prohibition to them. While the pro(cid:173)hibition is logical when applied to in(cid:173)mates of institutions which it is the clear responsibility of State or local govern(cid:173)ments to provide, such as prisons, the rationale is less clear with respect to residential facilities, which do not have to be provided. The effect of the pro(cid:173)hibition in such cases is to force govern(cid:173)ments, which assume the extra burden of providing them, either to turn away welfare level individuals most in need of their services or to meet medicaid re(cid:173)quirements which they would not be forced to meet for the SSI purposes of their residents if they were privately operated. While the best answer for public med(cid:173)ical facilities is certainly to upgrade these facilities to medicaid standards, medicaid standards are not necessarily fitting or feasible for all primarily resi(cid:173)dential facilities. In many cases these facilities have been considered to pro(cid:173)vide an adequate residence and place of general care for elderly people. In some areas, especially rural areas, the situa(cid:173)tion is further complicated by the lack of sufficient alternative facilities of this type. The bill would deal with these public institutions problems in two ways. First, it would state that any institution that was considered to be nonpublic for pur(cid:173)poses of prohibition on welfare pay(cid:173)ments to inmates of public institutions under prior law, as of the last day it was in effect--last December 31-which ",

Mr. President, David Broder's Sunday column in the Washington Post is a reminder that there were many men and women of great in(cid:173)tegrity and capability who worked in the Nixon administration-people who really devoted themselves heart and soul serving the country. As we make this transition from one administration to another, we would do well not to lose sight of this fact. Broder suggests that what these outstanding public servants need now is compassion, not stigma. I concur heartily with this evaluation, but I would add that they also deserve our thanks. I ask unanimous consent that David Broder's column be printed the to in RECORD. There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: THE \"NIXON PEOPLE\" (By David S. Broder) This has been a grim week for many people in Washington, but particularly for those men and women who worked in Richard Nixon's White House during the past five years. Some were still there on Monday, when the President belatedly admitted that he had kept from them, and from his lawyers and from his congressional defenders and from the American people, the full truth about his involvement in the Watergate cover-up. These men and women looked ruin in the face right along with him, and felt the added pain of betrayal. Others were working elsewhere--some of them having left the President's service by their own choice and some of them having been driven out by others who, 1n their arro(cid:173)gance, had convinced Mr. Nixon that the ex(cid:173)iles were not \"team players\" by the peculiar standards of fitness those formerly mighty presidential aides chose to define. Wherever they were and however they had come there, last week these men and women shared a common burden-the knowledge that for the rest of their lives, they would always be identified as \"Nixon people.\" For them, there is a special irony in the title of Carl Bernstein's and Bob Woodward's fine best-seller about the Watergate case. \"All the President's Men.\" They know-if no one else does-that it was only a handful of the President's men and none of the President's women who were responsible for the scheme that brought their administra(cid:173)tion to ruin. And they know, with a special poignance that no outsider can fully share, that it need not have been. \"What I still can't understand,\" said a pres(cid:173)idential aide seated in a West Wing office at mid-week, \"was how such stupidity and such superb accomplishment could exist side by side for so long.\" Those who were still working for Mr. Nixon this week, when the roof caved in on their last hopes that the evidence might somehow exonerate him, face problems 1n the future as difficult as the task of rationalizing the past. \"Face it,\" one of them said, \"this ad(cid:173)dress is not exactly the best reference to give your prospective employer.\" But those who covered the White House during the years of Richard Nixon know that there was as much devotion and dedication to public service in that building as there has been in past administrations. And the his(cid:173)torical record would be more than incom(cid:173)plete-it would be grossly distorted-if those guilty of the grossest arrogance and abuse of power in the Nixon White House were al(cid:173)lowed to stain the reputations of those who set a far different standard for themselves. Any reporter who worked there could do what I have done just these past few min(cid:173)utes: jot down on a piece of paper the names of those he admires for their work for Mr. Nixon and the country. The problem is that any list is partial and prejudiced-and there is a danger that those omitted may be damaged unwittingly by the implication that somehow they are less de(cid:173)serving of praise. But let me take that risk and enter the blanket disclaimer that those mentioned here are exemplars of many more who served their country well in the Nixon White House. One thinks of those like Bob Ellsworth and John Sears, who joined the Nixon cause in the mid-1960s, when there were more risks than rewards in doing so, and were rewarded for their loyalty by being exiled early from the White House by men who were not their moral or intellectual peers. One thinks of Bryce Harlow and Mel Laird and Herb Klein and Bob Finch and John Davies and Jim Keogh and John Whitaker. friends and associates of Mr. Nixon long be(cid:173)fore his White House days, who somehow were elbowed away from infiuence in the Oval Office. One thinks of the congressional liaison staff, of Bill Timmons and Ken BeLieu, and Dick Cook and Gene Cowen, of Blll Gifford and Max Friedersdorf and Tom Korologos, men who earned the respect of the lawmak(cid:173)ers with whom they worked, despite their constant uphill battle for recognition with(cid:173)in their organization. One thinks of the domestic policy staffs from Pat Moynihan and Steve Hess and John Price through Ken Cole and Ed Harper and Lew Engman. One thinks of the writers, like Lee Hueb(cid:173)ner and Ray Price, and the lawyers, like Len Garment and Fred Buzhardt, and of politi(cid:173)cians, like Harry Dent and Bill Baroody and Jerry Jones and Anne Armstrong-who put in every bit of their effort and ability, but did not park their consciences at the door. One thinks of Jerry Warren, suffering with few complaints in the no-man's-land of the war between the press corps and the Presi(cid:173)dent, but unfailingly courteous and patient in his own dealings. He and many others not mentioned here deserve far better than they got. They worked their hearts out for the President, and it is sympathy-not a stigma-they are entitled to now. KIDNEY DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE(cid:173)IV Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, there will be much discussion in the coming weeks about national health insurance. I believe in the need for a national health insurance program, and I also believe that we should not delay in adopting one. At the same time, we must not ignore \u2022 ",

He also is the chairman of the Senate Public Works Committee which has a very legitimate concern about dredge policy. Frankly, Mr. President, it is my opinion that the moratorium was prob(cid:173)ably not properly placed in an appropria(cid:173)tion bill in the first place, but, because it was, it is necessary to deal with this in this manner until the dredge study is completed. I would like to say here and now that in discussing this with my chairman, Senator STENNIS of Missis(cid:173)sippi, he and I both recognize that there is an area of confusion as to the proper roles in determining policy, on the one hand, of the use of such dredges, and the necessity of keeping the mechanical operation safe and efficient and practical for the hopper dredges. I am hopeful that when this Corps of Engineers' report is finished the policy question can be fully aired and dis(cid:173)cussed on the subject of where these dredges are best utilized by the Senate Public Works Committee. I think the Senate Public Works Committee is the proper forum for this kind of discussion. In talking with Senator RANDOLPH, he and I have no difference of opinion as to the basic commitment that we have to\u00b7 keep these dredges in safe operational condition. We do not want to endanger the lives of men. We also believe together, as we have discussed this privately and also in committee, that these hopper dredges represent an economic invest(cid:173)ment of the people of this country and, therefore, they should be utilized on a basis of economic practicality that will bring the taxpayer a good return on their investment. But here again I think basically we should delineate between the mechanical operation and the policy question of under what conditions and at what times and in what places they might best operate. In the meantime, I personally feel the question is best resolved by the language we have in this report and, hopefully, by the clarification I have offered for the RECORD today. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for yielding the floor, and I yield the floor back to him. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen(cid:173)ator from Mississippi is recognized. Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much for his remarks, and I especially thank him for his con(cid:173)tribution to this question about the hop(cid:173)per dredges and their availability where they are needed. I know last year when we were having the floods in the Lower Mississippi Valley, these hopper dredges saved our lives, so to speak, by keeping the channels open. We intended in no way to discredit or downgrade the study that is being made with reference to what would be the best course in the future. Our position is that we must have something now, and we . want these hopper dredges to be avail(cid:173)able. I thank the Senator from West Vir(cid:173)ginia for his helpful attitude. Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for just a moment? Mr. STENNIS. Yes, I yield. Mr. HATFIELD. I would just like to underscore what the Senator from Mis(cid:173)sissippi has stated, because he cites one of the most important examples of how the hopper dredge can respond to an emergency as compared to a pipeline dredge under private contracts which would have to go out on a bid basis. In some instances, it could take 90 days for bid process, whereas the hopper dredge can respond immediately where we have shoaling following storms. When we had the floods in the Mississippi River area, if it had not been for the possibility of transferring immediately hopper dredges into the Mississippi area, those ports could not have been maintained. Therefore, I think it is fundamental to understand that not only does the hop(cid:173)per dredge operate on the bar and out(cid:173)side the bar, but it can, under emer(cid:173)gency circumstances, operate inside the bar, and it must be free to do that. This has been part of the difficulty we have had in trying to define the language of the moratorium. Mr. STENNIS. again. Mr. President, I have certain remarks here that were formally made by the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. CooK) who had a very valid interest in this bill. He contributed to it on the floor. One of the actions of the conference was a matter that he did not approve of, and we regret that, of course, but we cannot avoid it. He has remarks that he wanted make, if he could have been here on the floor this afternoon, but he sent them to me to voice his objections, particularly to one item in this report, and I ask unan(cid:173)imous consent, Mr. President, that the remarks of the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. COOK) be included in the RECORD at this point. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. thank the Senator to I STATEMENT BY SENATOR COOK Unfortunately, I am necessarily absent during the Senate's consideration of House Report No. 93-1274, the conference report accompanying H.R. 15155, making appro(cid:173)priations for public works and power devel(cid:173)opment and for other purposes. Had I been present today, I would have been able to explain in detail why I would be compelled to vote nay on this report. I do request my remarks be included in the RECORD at this time. I would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the Public Works Subcommit(cid:173)tee of the Senate Appropriations Committee for his gracious consideration of the many water resource development projects in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I know he and his staff have worked very hard to resolve the many problems as they relate to projects in the commonwealth. I am especially grateful for the chairman's assistance in deleting funds for the Red River Lake project in Powell County, Ken(cid:173)tucky, from the Senate's version of H.R. 15155. However, I regret the determination of the conference committee to include $500,-000 for continued construction of the project. I remain convinced the construction of the lake is neither in the best interest of my State or the Nation. I realize my col(cid:173)leagues do not normally involve themselves in disputes that are of strictly local in(cid:173)terest and take the lead from the Senator whose area is most directly affected. How(cid:173)ever, I believe the Red River Lake project warrants further scrutiny so the record will be clear. Upon my return next week I will address in detail the inherent problems as(cid:173)sociated with damming Red River. Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, I do not know of any further requests. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the Public Works Appropriations Sub(cid:173)committee <Mr. STENNIS) a question concerning funding for a project that is contained in this bill. As the chairman knows, there is pend(cid:173)ing litigation involving Locks and Dams No. 26 on the Upper Mississippi River. This bill contains a $22 million appro(cid:173)priation for the project. Is it not correct that the language of the conference re(cid:173)port is not intended to affect that litiga(cid:173)tion or have any bearing whatsoever on the merits of that case? Mr. STENNIS. The Senator is correct. Mr. NELSON. I thank the Senator. Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, as far as I know, this covers the matters that are up for discussion. The rollcall votes on this matter have been overwhelming, Mr. President. In other words, the bill passed the Senate in its original form by a vote of 78 to 17. The House had passed the bill by a vote of 374 to 21, and the House established and approved the conference report by a vote of 376 to 12. So in view of this, and this being a unanimous report by the conferees, I do not think it is necessary for us, as man(cid:173)agers of the bill, to ask for a rollcall vote, unless someone else wishes to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques(cid:173)tion is on agreeing to the conference report. The conference report was agreed to. Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, I make a motion to reconsider. Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques(cid:173)tion is on agreeing to the motion to table. The motion was agreed to. Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate cer(cid:173)tain amendments which are in disagree(cid:173)ment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the amendments in disagree(cid:173)ment. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Resolved, That the House recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the Sen(cid:173)ate numbered 1 to the aforesaid bill and concur therein with an amendment as fol(cid:173)lows: In lieu of the sum named in said amend(cid:173)ment, insert: \"$1,411,960,000\".

            "54": "34348 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE October 8, 1974 Mr. BAKER, and Mr. White, who is the assistant to Mr. BAKER in this matter. They were pretty much aroused, and they came before our committee and we listened to them all at length. What we did, Mr. President, was put our heads together, and we came out with what we considered to be a balanced compromise. What did we do? We set out criteria and we spelled it all out. We said that if that licensee complied with those criteria in a comparative hearing, he was entitled to a presumption in his favor that he had served the public in(cid:173)terest and that the license should be renewed. That is what we did for the industry, and that was going quite a distance, be(cid:173)cause in that particular instance, we overruled, more or less, the WHDH case in Boston, channel 5 in Boston and cleared up other rulings. That was the one thing that had disturbed the indus(cid:173)try for a long, long time. At the same time, we left the license duration not to exceed 3 years, which is the present law. We came out with that kind of bill. We gave the licensee a presumption in order to assure the stability of the indus(cid:173)try, which was the important point. At the same time, we left it at 3 years. Why? Why did we leave it at 3 years? That is the question. Because this is an amendment now pending on this desk that has a multitude of Senators who are sponsoring it, and there will be a lot more who will come here, possibly, and vote for it, I think that this position ought to be made clear. We left it at 3 years because, in the past, one of the ways that the public ever got any relief was through a petition to deny. A petition to deny is filed at re(cid:173)newal time. If we make it 5 years instead of 3 years, what we are doing is stretch(cid:173)ing out the period so that the voice of the public cannot be heard within 3 years. We have to wait 5 years. That is the reason we did it. The Senator from Tennessee (Mr. BAKER) and I agreed on this compromise. I said throughout that hearing that we would never have a good bill until we made both sides unhappy, and that is exactly what we did. If, today, on the floor of the Senate, we want one side to throw their hats in the air in a glee(cid:173)ful exhibition, that is one thing, and allow the other side to shed crocodile tears, we can begin to change the bill that was reported out of committee. I have no personal interest in this matter. My job and Senator BAKER's job was to serve the public interest, and that is precisely what we tried to do. That is precisely what we tried to do, and that is what we have done. I am asking the Senate today to adopt the recommendation of the committee and allow us to go to conference and iron out any differences that might exist between the Senate version and the House version. If we begin to change and extend the period, we shall have very precious little or nothing to talk about when we go to conference. I tell the Senators, we may not hear from our constituents today, but the time w1II come when we wm hear from our constituents, because I am afraid that if we go too far in creating au(cid:173)tonomy, it is going to be rather difficult. Not too long ago, we had a program on TV, something to do with innocence, where there was shown an offensive scene in a girls' reformatory. I understand that ABC is going to put on another thing, outrageous, which has to do with the molestation of a teenager by a science teacher. If we want to keep this industry within the realm of responsibility, and I am not anti-industry and they know it, let us work out an assurance that if they do a good job in the public interest, at least they have a plus for renewal, as against blue-sky competitive applica(cid:173)tions. At the same time, I beg my col(cid:173)leagues-! beg my colleagues today-do not remove the voice of the public. Do not remove the voice of the public and compel it to wait 5 years before it can make a complaint. Mr. President, after 9 days of hearings, and 2 days of committee deliberation in open executive session, the Commerce Committee is reporting an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 12993, the House-passed broadcast license re(cid:173)newal bill. The committee heard over 100 wit(cid:173)nesses, including Members of Congress, the Director of the Office of Telecommu(cid:173)nications Policy, the Department of Jus(cid:173)tice, the Chairman of the FCC, repre(cid:173)sentatives of several citizens groups, representatives of minority groups, representatives of the broadcasting in(cid:173)dustry, a representative of the AFL-CIO, representatives of religious groups, and many others. Testimony ranged from the view that no legislation was necessary to support of the House-passed bill. Everyone, how(cid:173)ever, supported the principle that tpe public's interest is paramount, and what(cid:173)ever Congress decides to do should rest on that consideration alone. It was generally agreed that the broad(cid:173)cast licensee who conscientiously serves the public should have some reasonable assurance his license will be renewed. At the same time a licensee who had not ful-. filled his commitment the public should have his application for license renewal denied. I believe the legislation which the com(cid:173)mittee has reported affirms the necessity that broadcast licensees have stability in the public interest. It also affirms the necessity for the competitive spur which inheres in the Communications Act. As reported it would do the following: First. Direct the FCC to establish by rule procedures for broadcast licensees to follow throughout the terms of their li(cid:173)censes to ascertain the problems, needs, and interests of the residents of their service areas for purposes of program service. These rules could prescribe differently for different classes of broadcast stations. Second. Direct the FCC at renewal time, in determining whether the public interest had been served, to consider: Whether the licensee during the preced(cid:173)ing license term followed the applicable ascertainment procedures; whether the licensee in its program service substan-to tially met the ascertained problems, needs, and interests of his service area; and whether, during the preceding li(cid:173)cense term, the operation of the station was not otherwise characterized by seri(cid:173)ous deficiencies. If the Commission deter(cid:173)mines that the licensee has satisfied the requirements of clauses (1), (2), and (3), a presumption shall be established that the public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by such re(cid:173)newal. In a comparative renewal proceeding this presumption, of course, would give way to other compelling factors. In other words a licensee is in no sense of the word given a license in perpetuity. Third. Require the Commission to con(cid:173)duct a study to determine how it might expedite the elimination of those regu(cid:173)lations of broadcast licensees required by the Communications Act which do not serve the public interest, and to make annual reports thereon, including any recommendations for legislation, to the Commerce Committees of the House and Senate. Fourth. Direct the FCC to complete docket 18110-multiple ownershiP-bY December 31, 1974. Mr. President, I believe this bill will further the larger and more effective use of radio and television by clarifying the broadcast license renewal standards and procedures in order to better inform broadcast licensees and their challengers of what is required under the public interest standard of the Communications Act. It will also better inform the listen(cid:173)ing and viewing public of what it may rightfully expect from those who are given the privilege of using the airwaves. Licensees who have received broad(cid:173)cast licenses and operated stations in ac(cid:173)cordance with Commission rules, regu(cid:173)lations, and policies such as in cross(cid:173)ownership, integration of management and ownership, should not find these fac(cid:173)tors injected into the renewal proceeding unless there has been a change of cir(cid:173)cumstances or a failure to comply or an abuse of the policy or rule. Under this legislation challenges are entitled to file competing applications at renewal time. Section 309(e) \u00b7of the Communications Act provides for a full hearing. Under those circumstances therefore the in(cid:173)cumbent and a challenger are afforded an opportunity to submit all relevant data as to all applications and challenge any data that is submitted. After all the evidence is submitted and the hearings completed, the Commission will make a judgment as to whether incumbent has satisfied the criteria established by this legislation. If a finding is in the affirma(cid:173)tive then a presumption is made on be(cid:173)half of the existing licensee. This is a plus of major significance in the renewal proceeding. However, the FCC must take into ac(cid:173)count those factors which have a bear(cid:173)ing on the public interest even though they are unrelated to program service or operation and consider them alongside the presumption. Thus, for example, to the extent the FCC has flexibility to deal with media concentration in a unique case, which ",

Also, in deal(cid:173)ing with spedfic sectors in which price pres(cid:173)sures are particularly virulent, efforts will have to be concentrated on food, energy, construction, medical care and primary in(cid:173)dustrial capa.city. The Council, however, will not be a wage and price control agency. Controls do not stop infiation; they did not \u00b7do so the last time around nor even in World War II when prices increased despite severe rationing. Indeed, controls can make inflation worse. They often create shortages, hamper in(cid:173)creased production, stifie growth and cause unemployment. Ultimately, they can cause the fixer and black marketeer to fiourish while decent citizens confront empty shelves and long waiting lines. NATIONAL COMMISSION ON PRODUCTIVITY Increased productivity-working smarter to increase the total economic output of our work force and equipment--is a vital com(cid:173)ponent of the drive to increase production. This long-term goal wUl be pursued by a re(cid:173)vitalized National Commission on Produc(cid:173)tivity. The Commission will also extend and deepen the drive to increase productivity in government--Federal, state and local. It is important that government set a good ex(cid:173)ample of leadership in this effort, and we may be sure that there is no shortage of opportunity for productivity in the opera(cid:173)tions of government. The rest of its effort will be in the private sector, with primary emphasis on meaningful programs at the plant level. Special attention will be devoted to food, transportation, construction and health-services. EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE Increases in unemployment have raised the Nation's unemployment rate to 5.8 percent in September. During this period of high infia(cid:173)tion and unemployment, there is a need for Federal standby authority with minimal in(cid:173)fiationay impact, which will help alleviate the impact of unemployment should unem(cid:173)ployment rates rise. Such action is necessary to help alleviate unemployment problems in areas most affected and to assure that the impact of infiation does not unduly burden those workers least able to bear the costs. The National Employment Assistance Act of 1974 would respond to these needs by au(cid:173)thorizing, during the next 18-month period two programs which would begin to operate should the national unemployment rate aver(cid:173)age 6 percent or more for 3 months: (1) A temporary program of income re(cid:173)placement known as the Special Unemploy(cid:173)ment Assistance Program for experienced unemployed workers in areas of high un(cid:173)employment who have exhausted all other unemployment compensation or who are not eligible for such compensation; and (2) A program of employment projects for these same areas, known as the Community Improvement Program. While the primary purpose of the two pro(cid:173)grams is to alleviate the hardships of un. employment upon individuals, it will also alleviate the adverse impact on those local economies hardest hit by unemployment. The unemployment assistance benefits serve to cushion the effects of protracted un(cid:173)employment by providing additional income replacement to workers who have either ex(cid:173)hausted their regular unemployment com(cid:173)pensation benefits or to individuals with a demonstrated labor force attachment not otherwise eligible for unemployment insur(cid:173)ance benefits. Not only does this replace lost income, but it provides workers with the time and opportunity to look for work con(cid:173)sistent with their skills and experience. The table below shows funds and services now available under Unemployment Com(cid:173)pensation laws and the Comprehensive Em-ployment and Training Act (CETA). It also indicates how much would become available over' a twelve month period for current un\u00b7 employment programs, and for the two new proposed programs, at average national un(cid:173)employment levels of 6 percent and 6.5 per(cid:173)cent. Title II of the National Employment Assistance Act would make a further $1 bll(cid:173)lion available 1f national unemployment ex(cid:173)ceeded 7 percent on average for three months or more.

Jobs provided by these projects help to cushion the loss of income due to unemployment, while enabling State and local governments to provide their cit(cid:173)izens with a socially useful product. Because projects under this program will be generated in and geared to areas with high unemployment in which there exists a sub(cid:173)stantial amount of available manpower, there should be little or no adverse impact on the regular labor market. There is a limit of $7,000 a year for jobs authorized by this pro(cid:173)gram and therefore the average wages will be considerably less than those earned in the private sector. Most workers will obtain pri(cid:173)vate jobs as the economy grows. The added cost of Community Improve(cid:173)ment Projects may be offset somewhat by reduced demand for food stamps and welfare payments, and by some increase in tax re(cid:173)ceipts from employees in these projects. Basic funding provisions of the National Employment Assistance Act Funds for both the Special Unemployment Assistance Program and the Community Im(cid:173)provement Program become available when the national unemployment rate reaches 6.0 percent on average for three consecutive months. For the Special Unemployment As(cid:173)sistance Program, such funds as are neces(cid:173)sary are authorized if unemployment 1s above this level. For Community Improvement Pro(cid:173)gram, successive increments of funds are authorized 1f the national unemployment level reaches, for three consecutive months an average of: 6.0 percent--$500 m11lion dollars author(cid:173)ized; 6.5 percent--another $750 m1111on dollars authorized; and 7.0 percent-an additional one billion dol(cid:173)lars authorized. When the national unemployment rate re(cid:173)cedes below these respective levels for three consecutive months on average, Federal funds for new projects will cease. Eighty percent of the available funds for Community Improvement Projects w111 be distributed by formula among eligible ap(cid:173)plicants based on (1) the relative number of unemployed residing 1n areas of substan-tial unemployment within their jurisdictions, and (2) the severity of unemployment; 20 percent would be expended at the discretion of the Secretary, principally to finance proj(cid:173)ects in areas which become eligible after the formula distribution is made. The local labor market area-and balance of State-unemployment rates determine the communities in which both programs will b~ operating. Both programs are directed to those areas in which unemployment is high(cid:173)est. Both programs come into effect in a labor market area, with a population of 250,-000 or more, when it has an unemployment rate equal to or in excess of 6.5 percent for three months on average. The balance of each State not included in such areas will con(cid:173)stitute a single area in which the programs will become effective subject to the same un(cid:173)employment rate criterion. When the local unemployment level recedes below 6.5 per(cid:173)cent on average for three consecutive months no new individuals become eligible and no new projects may be started. Special unemployment assistance program This new temporary unemployment assist(cid:173)ance program will be separate from but sup(cid:173)plemental to the existing Federal-State Un(cid:173)employment Insurance (UI) System, and is designed to extend coverage to experienced persons in the labor force who have exhaust(cid:173)ed their UI benefits or are otherwise ineli(cid:173)gible for such benefits. The program would be operated through agreements with the States. All experienced members of the work(cid:173)force will be eligible for benefits as follows: They must have last worked in a labor market area (or balance of State area) with substantial unemployment. Benefits will be governed by benefit pro(cid:173)visions of each State UI law. Individuals who had exhausted their bene(cid:173)fits under State UI programs will be eligible for a maximum of 13 weeks benefits. Individuals who were not previously eli(cid:173)gible for State UI benefits wm be eligible for a maximum of 26 weeks provided that they have attachment to labor force as required by the relevant State UI law. Benefits for UI ineligibles wlll generally be the amount that would be payable as com(cid:173)puted under State law if all work was per(cid:173)formed for covered employers. No new beneficiaries would be eligible after June 30, 1976. Community improvement program New program is structured so that as the national employment rate rises, more money is available for community improvement projects. Projects are limited to areas eligible for the Special Unemployment Assistance Pro(cid:173)gram. Eligible applicants are prime sponsors un(cid:173)der the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, in areas that qualify. Projects may be with State or local govern(cid:173)ment agencies. Each Community Improvement project is limited to 6 months duration. '\"Not more than 10 percent of a sponsor's funds may be used for administrative costs, supplies, material, and equipment. Individuals eligible for employment on these projects are those who have exhausted their benefits under the Special Unemploy(cid:173)ment Assistance Program. Wages paid project employees must be at least the minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act, or the State or local minimum wage, whichever is higher; how(cid:173)ever, in no case may the wage exceed an an(cid:173)nual rate of $7,000. State or local govern(cid:173)ments may not supplement wages with their own funds. Prohibitions against poEtical activities and discrimination apply to the program. The Community Improvement Program will provide funding for projects such as conser(cid:173)vation, maintenance, or restoration of nat-",

It took us 6 years to win the fight for openness in California, but the result has been healthy and reassuring to the public. The vast majority of our fellow citizens want to see mandatory open meetings, not only here in Congress but in their State legislatures, and in Federal agency meetings. Aside from legitimate instances of national security or protec(cid:173)tion of specific legal rights of individ(cid:173)uals, there is no excuse at all for carry(cid:173)ing on the people's business behind closed doors. The amendment offered by Mr. GuN(cid:173)TER and Mr. BROWN is simply a recogni(cid:173)tion of the need to restore public trust in our institutions by opening up our deliberations. protects individual rights and national security concerns by allowing closed meetings on these topics. But it also protects the public's right to know what we are doing on their behalf, and in their name. There is far too much secrecy in this town, and in this Government. Today we have the opportunity to do some(cid:173)thing about it, and set our own House straight. We can do that by voting for this amendment, and showing that we have nothing to hide from the people who have sent us here. Mr. MOSS. Mr. Chairman, I opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I do not think it is nec(cid:173)essary for me to lay my credentials on the line for openness in Government and I do not intend to, but this amendment, while well intentioned by its sponsors in my judgment is the fashioning of a straitjacket and the providing of more ways of closing meetings than opening t~em. I have had a fair amount of expe(cid:173)rience both in chairing committees and in dealing with matters of disclosure and ~ondisclosure of information to the pub(cid:173)he. I served in the same body as the dis(cid:173)tinguished gentleman who preceded me in this well, and during my service in the California Legislature we had no closed meetings. I do not know what happened after I left, some 16 years later, when. he became a member of that body, that It ha.d closed meetings. But I have been voting here in this House for the reforms that were true reforms that made committee meetings open. a~d we now operate in our Committee on Inter(cid:173)s~ate ~nd Foreign Commerce most of the time Just as a matter of course with the committee being open. I ~o not think anyone wants to close meetmgs, but the invitations here to close. them are certainly numerous. In chairing the Subcommittee on Com(cid:173)merce and Finance of the Committee on Intersta.te and Foreign Commerce, where I have had the jurisdiction over the Fed(cid:173)eral Trade Commission and the Federal Product Safety Commission and the Se(cid:173)curities and Exchange Commission, un(cid:173)der (E) (2), and (3), I can well imagine that I would have a confronta(cid:173)tion on almost every occasion by some(cid:173)one who would want to protect the so(cid:173).called trade secrets. It (1), It is interesting what we here in this country call trade secrets. We all know how sensitive the petroleum industry is to trade secrets. Material they may even file with the governments of the Prov(cid:173)inces of Canada and make widely avail(cid:173)able to all persons there, that same ma(cid:173)terial is carefully foreclosed from public availability in the United States, because it is a trade secret. A trade secret can have to do with any cost figure or esti(cid:173)mate of production, or almost anything one can think of can be called a trade secret. So as I look at this proposed change in the rules of the House, to the sponsors I say their intentions are noble, their words are confusing, they could have said in far fewer sentences much more with greater impact, and this amend(cid:173)ment out of all charity ought to be de(cid:173)feated. Mr. GUNTER. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. MOSS. Yes, I will be happy to yield first to the gentleman from Ohio, who first requested, and then tO the gen(cid:173)tleman from Florida. Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for the gentleman from California. I serve on the Commit(cid:173)tee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce with the gentleman. I know the gentle(cid:173)man from California conducts reason(cid:173)able, rational, and thorough hearings when he prepares legislation for markup. What we are trying to do is provide an opportunity for committees such as ours and the subcommittee such as his to exercise judgment in this regard. If the committee in the work of markup de(cid:173)cides there is no danger in its delibera(cid:173)tions of exposing trade secrets or no danger of getting itself involved in a regulatory case when it is not proper to do so, then it is perfectly reasonable for the committee to determine that its meeting be an open meeting. This is ex(cid:173)actly what we are trying to accomplish. Mr. MOSS. Mr. Chairman, let me say to the gentleman, as I said earlier, I have had a great deal of experience in chairing committees, investigating com(cid:173)mittees. We have one rUle of this House that says where a person feels that his reputation might be injured, he may re(cid:173)quest an executive session. I recall on occasion after occasion where the insistence upon that right of the individual appearing before the in(cid:173)vestigative committee was made either personally or by his counsel and then we held our hearing. The CHAffiMAN. The time of the gen(cid:173)tleman from California has expired. Mr. ECKHARDT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. MOSS. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if the gentleman from Texas would yield for one moment? Mr. ECKHARDT. I yield to the gentle(cid:173)man from California. Mr. MOSS. I merely wanted to com(cid:173)plete what I had to say. Under the rule then we\u00b7 took the testimony in executive session after the committee had reviewed it and then we were able to release it. This kind of abuse is invited by the lan(cid:173)guage of this legislation. I urge its defeat . said Mr. ECKHARDT. Mr. Chairman, the problem that this amendment addresses itself to is one that the gentleman froni Florida (Mr. FASCELL) the gentleman from Washington (Mr. FoLEY) and other Members of the House worked on for maybe 6 months. What we were trying to do was achieve maximum openness in meetings; but at the same time recognize certain limitations with respect to one kind of meeting' the markup session. What we ultimately decided is that a hearing ought to be open completely with the narrowest of exceptions, because a hearing produces the evidence that comes before the Congress, that the peo(cid:173)ple of the United States are entitled also to know about, in order to determine why we made our decision and on what facts. There is not any excuse for closing a hearing for anything, except in narrow areas like that of national security. If there is a trade secret involved, the wit(cid:173)ness does not have to disclose it in the hearing. He can say he has a trade secret. Ordinarily nobody would push him on the point. If he insisted, he might even have the right to refuse to reveal it. Mr. !CHORD. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. ECKHARDT. Yes, surely. Mr. !CHORD. The gentleman there is only one place---Mr. ECKHARDT. I am getting to two others. . Mr. !CHORD. Does the gentleman not agree with the gentleman from Califor(cid:173)nia (Mr. Moss) that w~ are going to sub(cid:173)ject a person to ridicule by this process? Mr. ECKHARDT. If the gentleman will permit me, those are the other two points. There is one point on national security, one that recognizes that whole(cid:173)some provision that was put into our rules in order to meet the old problem of the Dies Committee when persons were being investigated for alleged personal matters, and aprobrium resulted from their merely being called and interro(cid:173)gated in public as to whether they were Communists. Our rules say that hearings that would subject a person to aprobrium may be closed. The third exception is with re(cid:173)spect to typical housekeeping matters within the House. What this does is en(cid:173)large the possibility of opening a hear(cid:173)ing to another very broad exception. It says that a hearing may be closed if it will disclose information relating to trade secrets or financial or commercial information pertaining specifically to a given person, or the information is re(cid:173)quired to be kept secret in order to pre(cid:173)vent undue injury to the competitive po(cid:173)sition of such person. So, what we are doing is giving the committee a right to close the hearing in a case which the present rules wm not permit the committee to close the hear(cid:173)ing. The whole argument 'for openness was that no matter how much the com(cid:173)mittee wants to close the hearing, the committee should not be permitted to ex(cid:173)clude the people of the United States from knowing what Congress was acting upon. It just passes my understanding that men can get in this well and say that: this amendment is for openness, that it 'increases openness, when in fact, as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. FASCELL), ",

Although I would guess that the bulk of the students in the group live no more than 20 to 25 miles from Philadelphia, there were some who have never been there, not even to see such hallowed American spots as Independence Hall or the Liberty Bell(cid:173)a result, in many instances, of the pathology of fear surrounding the \"city.\" Possibly this experience, while not minimizing urban problems, made some more aware of the cultural and educational possibilities in(cid:173)herent in urban life. Please be assured that the above com(cid:173)ments are my own. I enjoyed Close-Up im(cid:173)mensely, I believe the students did, and I'm certainly going to make every effort to get letters off to the Congressmen who influence your appropriations. I think your program is fine and deserving of every pos(cid:173)sible support. Sincerely, MILDRED COLLIER. NEWTOWN SQUARE, PA., May 20,1973. CLOSE-UP Washington, D.C. DEAR CLOSE-UP: I have discovered your questionnaire is not among the possessions I arrived home with, so I am hoping this letter will cover the points. You have taken a great concept and made it a working reality-you are to be con(cid:173)gratulated. In this the teachers of Delaware County agree. Any criticism that you heard was not aimed at the fundamental struc(cid:173)ture-that was accepted one hundred per(cid:173)cent. It was merely trivial complaints or de(cid:173)tails of personal disagreements. Perhaps I can best express my feelings about the program by saying that when Gloria and Heidi and Mary Beth and Shirley and I stand up in our Assembly Tuesday morning to tell about CLOSE-UP, we will do it with pride. We are proud of what we learned of the group we were associated with. I believe that is the highest compliment I can pay to any person or group. I assume your questionnaire asked about what was most/least valuable, etc. To me as a teacher the experience of being with other Social Studies teachers in a stimulating, human environment was a unique oppor(cid:173)tunity which I made the most of-I have a grasp of their philosophies, problems, solu(cid:173)tions, that I could not have obtained else(cid:173)where. Personally I learned little from the semi(cid:173)nars that was new-but that was surely not the case for all faculty members. To me, standing in the Watergate hearing room was the experience of a lifetime and I would never have been there without CLOSE-UP. So do not assume that all faculty which do not appear at all seminars are \"free-load(cid:173)ing\"-they are perhaps finding their own ways of experiencing the politics of Wash(cid:173)ington and are very appreciative of the op(cid:173)portunity to do so. Having carefully considered and discussed your format, I conclude that I could not im(cid:173)prove upon it (which is an unusual state(cid:173)ment for me to make.) On a more personal level-it was great talking-Ronnie-Dixie-John. The fac111-ties of the 360-acre Charles Ellis School and my services are available any time. In friendship, MARTHA B. BARRETT. DELAWARE COUNTY BOARD OF ASSISTANCE, Chester, Pa., June 4,1973. Mr. STEPEN A. JANGER, Director of Special Pro!}f'ams, Close Up, Wash(cid:173)ington, D.C. DEAR STEVE, I want to express to you my sincere appreciation for being responsive to my proposal to bring Close Up to Delaware County and for the tremendous week that we had learning about our democracy. From our initial discussion you were aware of the risk since we are a small county with only twenty-nine public, private, and parochial schools but you stm came. This decision to come reflects the purpose of Close Up which is to go wherever there is a commu(cid:173)nity which wants its students and teachers to participate in a truly great learning ex(cid:173)perience. Words cannot express the iinmense hap(cid:173)piness which I saw on the faces of the students and teachers. Despite the demand(cid:173)ing but worthwhile and exciting schedule, the majority of students and teachers wanted an(cid:173)other week (at the minimum) to learn more about their government and to exchange ideas with the speakers, the Close Up staff, and other students. Since our return, I have learned that students have already met to plan an agenda for their involvement in local government. During this week, I saw students and teachers with difierent interests, opinions, and aptitudes come in contact with one an(cid:173)other and, to the best of my knowledge, really get along. Indicative of the cohesive(cid:173)ness of the students is that they are planning a picnic. I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to your fine staff for their re(cid:173)sponsiveness and interest on behalf of the students and teachers. Watching your very capable program director, Margery Kraus, with her enthusiasm and energy despite her pregnancy of seven months really gave me a personal lift because I sometimes felt tired. Let me conclude by again expressing my sincere appreciation. Close Up 1s a great and needed program designed to give young people and teachers a learning experience which they wlll never forget.-Certainly 1 won't. Continued success.

Mr. Speaker, yes(cid:173)terday's article in the Washington Post concerning the cancellation of my ap(cid:173)pearance as the speaker at the annual dinner of the Georgetown University Alwnni Association in St. Louis has prompted many colleagues to inquire into the circumstances. Accordingly I am placing in the RECORD here below both the article itself, and the relevant correspondence as it appeared in the st. Louis Post Dispatch following the cancellation: [From the Washington Post, October 7, 1974] SYMINGTON TALK INVITATION WITHDRAWN (By Martin Well) An invitation for Rep. James w. Syming(cid:173)ton ( (D-Mo.) to speak at a dinner of George(cid:173)town University alumni was withdrawn after objections from antiabortion groups. Symington had been invited by repre(cid:173)sentatives of the university's St. Louts alumni club to speak at the 23d annual John Carroll awards banquet, to be held in St. Louis on Oct. 19. The St. Louis club withdrew the invitation in August after receiving protests that ap(cid:173)peared to center on the abortion issue, a Washington-based omcial of the university's alumni association said last night. Named for the university's founder, the banquet honors distinguished alumni, and is held annually in various cities through(cid:173)out the nation under joint sponsorship of the local alumni club and the university's national alumni association. Abortion proved a major issue during Symington's successful campaign last sum(cid:173)mer for renomination to the house seat he has held since 1969. Both Symington and his opponent, John P. Doyle, professed a personal abhorrence of abortion, but Symington spoke frequently about the complex legal issues involved and during the campaign last summer said, \"I believe abortion ought to be confined to cases of rape and incest and danger to the health and well-being of the mother.\" He came under strong attack from anti-abortion groups. In cancelling the invitation to Symington, the local alumni club acted independently of both the university and the national alumni association, said Joseph K. Dowley, director of programs for the national group. \"The way they felt was if they had pick(cid:173)eters, or any unpleasantness outside, it would detract from the whole program,\" he said. \"Although other people in other capaci\u00b7 ties might have decided a difierent way, we weren't out there and don't know the dif(cid:173)ficulties that faced them ... \" he added. Dowley said that the invitation was with(cid:173)drawn not to stop free discourse, but to prevent any incident from detracting from the dinner's purpose-to honor five distin(cid:173)guished alumni. He described the university itself as hav(cid:173)ing a quite liberal speaker's policy, under which students have heard from \"everybody from Abby Hoffman to you name it.\" About 300 to 350 persons are expected to attend the banquet. Symington has been re(cid:173)placed as the main speaker by the Rev. Edward O'Donnell, editor of a Catholic news \u2022 paper in St. Louis. In response to the cancellation of the in(cid:173)vitation Symington, who could not be reach(cid:173)ed last night, reportedly expressed concern over the abll1ty of pickets to prevent a con(cid:173)gressman from speaking and college alumni from listening. He was said to have suggested that a uni(cid:173)versity and its alumni should be \"among the last to succumb to such tyranny.'1 Georgetown is a Jesuit-sponsored institu(cid:173)tion with about 50,000 alumni. Symington, an Episcopalian and a resident of the st. Louis area, is a graduate of Yale College and co(cid:173)lumbia University Law School. [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Sept.5,1974] PRo LIFE, ANTI IDEAs: ANTI-ABORTIONISTS DoN'T WANT To LET CoNGRESSMAN SPEAK (Representative James W.

SYMINGTON: On Saturday even(cid:173)ing, Oct. 19, 1974, the Georgetown University Alumnae Association will hold its annual John Carroll Awards Banquet at the Stouffer Riverfront Inn in St. Louis. This affair, which is the highlight of our annual three-day meeting, wlll be attended by approximately 175 persons from throughout the United States and by 250 persons from the St. Louis area. This 1s an invitation to ask that you address us as our principal speaker. I realize that that evening is just 17 days before the election and that your time will be at a premium; however, I ask that you fav(cid:173)orably consider our invitation because of the local and national nature of our assemblage.

            "254": "34548 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE October 9, 197 4 Armed Forces: Progress, Problems, and Prospects,\" reported the following: The quality of volunteers, as measured by the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) has generally improved since fiscal year 1970. There has been a steady but modest decline in enlistees with above average AFQT scores, a moderate increase in those with average scores, and--of most importance-a steady decrease in enlistees with below average scores. As measured by educational attainment, however, modest declines in proportions of Army and Navy enlistees that had completed high school were experienced in fiscal 1973, principally because of large accession needs. Among \"true\" volunteers-those freely choos(cid:173)ing m111tary service and not influenced by the draft-the proportion of Army high school graduates dropped from almost 60 percent ln fiscal 1972 to under 50 percent early in fiscal 1973. While neither of these indicators, standardized test scores or levels of edu(cid:173)cation, directly relate to job performance, they are significant in one respect-that is, they both indicate a deficiency in the number of volunteers with \"above aver(cid:173)age\" intelligence. It is these \"above aver(cid:173)age\" volunteers that are needed to fill the \"qualitative\" manpower requirements of our volunteer system. Certainly it is encouraging that there is a decrease in the number of below(cid:173)average scores among enlistees, but the decrease in above-average scores is equally discouraging. These are the men and women most readily trained to be(cid:173)come the highly qualified technician needed to maintain the proper mainten(cid:173)ance and functioning of the sophisti(cid:173)cated weaponry and support equipment of our age. It is a waste of the taxpayers' money to spend billions of dollars on research and development of new weapons, if we are unwilling to establish programs to meet the \"qualitative'' manpower re(cid:173)quirements necessary to operate this weaponry. Furthermore, \"qualitative\" recruits are needed to fill key leadership positions. The new infantry tactics place even more responsibility on today's combat leader. The new theme, \"follow me, do as I do,\" can only be properly executed by a \"qual(cid:173)itative\" leader who knows exactly what he is doing. The emerging trends indicate that the present recruiting programs will prob(cid:173)ably be unable to fill the necessary quota of \"qualitative'' volunteers. What is needed are new programs, programs which would recruit better educated, technically qualified, civilian trained Americans to help fill the void in \"quali(cid:173)tative\" manpower requirements. So there is no misunderstanding of my intentions, however, let me :first say that these remarks are in no way meant to downgrade the existing volunteer sys(cid:173)tem. The All Volunteer Armed Force is, and can continue to be, a viable and practical alternative to the bonds of con(cid:173)scription. However, we must not let our(cid:173)selves be lured into a false sense of se(cid:173)curity. In any program, especially one of this nature, there is always room for improvement. So it is today, in this vein, that I in-troduce a bill creating programs and in(cid:173)centives which will provide additional motivation for high-caliber, prospective enlistees. Since the All Volunteer Forces Quality and Incentive Act of 1974 is both lengthy and complicated, I would like to brie:fly highlight the important aspects of this significant proposal. Ti tie I of the bill would establish tech(cid:173)nical service academies for enlisted men. Essentially, these would be 2-year junior colleges for leadership and technical training, patterned after our present service academies for officers. Nomina(cid:173)tions and appointments to these tech(cid:173)nical service academies would be made, as nearly as possible, in the same manner as appointments are made to present military academies. While attending an academy, a stu(cid:173)dent would be eligible for pay benefits, which would increase according to the number of months spent at the academy. During his second or senior year, a stu(cid:173)dent would receive one-half the amount of the pay grade E-3. Fields of study would include electron(cid:173)ics, aviation mechanics, nuclear energy, space sciences, marine engineering, and any other field as determined by the needs of the military department con(cid:173)cerned. Upon graduation from the academy as E-..4's, trainees would then serve a 4-year active duty obligation. Title II of the bill calls for the estab(cid:173)lishment of a Reserve Enlisted Training Corps-RETC-at selected existing voca(cid:173)tional institutions, enabling graduates of these schools to enter the Armed Forces at higher enlisted grades. The RETC program, which is designed as a parallel to the ROTC program, would offer enlist(cid:173)ment iricentives in the form of payments of $75 per month to each student enrolled in the program. Furthermore, full tuition scholarships would be available for students demon(cid:173)strating outstanding leadership and learning potential. Upon graduation, stu(cid:173)dents under the regular RETC program would serve an active duty obligation of 2 years, while students participating in the scholarship program would serve 4 years on active duty. The RETC program is designed to pro(cid:173)duce technically trained men of the kind and quality needed by specialized units of the Armed Forces. Title III would establish the Armed Forces critical speciality scholarship pro(cid:173)gram. This program would essentially be an expansion of the current Armed Forces health professions scholarship program to include critical skills other than in the health professions. This pro(cid:173)gram would be \"open\" for any area deemed critical by the Secretary of De(cid:173)fense, with both enlisted men and officers being eligible for participation. Title IV would increase the present GI bill to include tuition costs, as computed on a national average. Participants in this program would earn one \"academic\" year for each year served on active duty, with a maximum of 4 academic years per participant. In conclusion, let me reemphasize that the present recruiting programs are not ful:tllling the necessary \"qualitative\" manpower quotas. The future success of an all volunteer armed force depends on our willingness to take innovative actions as problems arise. The bill I introduce today is an attempt to take a significant and legitimate step in filling the \"quali(cid:173)tative\" gap in our all volunteer Armed Force. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in full in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD as follows: ' s. 4110 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this Act may be cited as the \"All Volunteer Armed Forces Quality and Incentive Act of 1974\".

Small farmers who cannot sustain the farm family without additional land or without supplementary income from non(cid:173)agricultural activities; 3. The landless, some of whom migrate to larger towns and cities for off-season tem(cid:173)porary employment. Altogether, these categories contain some 700 million individuals. We do not now have all the information we need to identify the \u00b7different grcups in individual countries. We are, therefore, collaborating with the Food and Agriculture Organization on the develop(cid:173)ment of a better data base and on obtaining a better understanding of the present and potential levels of productivity of individuals in each category. You will recall that we stated that a reasonable overall productivity improvement objective was to increase production on the 100 mlllion farms, with areas of less than 5 hectares, so that by 1985 their output would \u00b7be growing by 5% per year, a rate more than double that of the 1960s. It is clearly an ambitious goal, but one whose achievement is made more urgent by the continuing food shortage in the developing world. The Bank is determined to pursue this goal. But I should stress that what the Bank does is much less important that what gov(cid:173)ernments do to deal with these issues. Prog(cid:173)ress will only be possible if the countries themselves are willing to make strong com(cid:173)mitments to pursue agricultural strategies directed toward the promotion of new in(cid:173)come and employment opportunities for the poorest groups. This will involve commit(cid:173)ment to effective land reform, assurance of adequate credit at reasonable cost, and re(cid:173)assessment of pricing, taxation, and subsidy policies which discriminate against the rural areas. We are prepared to work closely with governments that wish to take such actions. Already we see evidence that the objective of a 5% per annum increase in production can be realized. In the past year, we assisted in financing 51 rural development projects in 42 countries involving a total investment of almost $2 billion. These projects are expected to benefit directly at least 12 mtllion indi(cid:173)viduals. They should generate increases in production of more than 5% per annum for the beneficiaries whose present incomes aver(cid:173)age less than $75 per capita. During the next five years our lending to agriculture should double, supporting proj(cid:173)ects whose total costs will approximate $15 billion and whose direct benefits should ex(cid:173)tend to 100 million rural poor. We expect the economic returns on these investments to exceed 15%. They would be similar to the following five projects which were approved by the Bank's Board of Direc(cid:173)tors in a single two-week period this summer. A $10.7 million credit for agricultural de(cid:173)velopment in the southern region of the Sudan which will provide a higher standard of nutrition for some 50,000 farm families through expanded food crops; will assist an additional 13,000 farm families through new cash crops; and will benefit roughly half the region's t6tal population of three million people through improved, disease-free live(cid:173)stock. An $8 million credit for a comprehensive rural development project in Upper Volta, covering extension services, small-farmer credit, improved water resources, and greater access to health facilities; a project calcu(cid:173)lated, in all, to benefit some 360,000 individ(cid:173)uals, 7% of the country's total population in over 10% of the country's cultivated land area. A $21.5 million credit for a broadly based livestock development program in Kenya, in(cid:173)cluding provisions designed to assist tradi(cid:173)tional nomadic herders; to improve 10 milllon acres of communal rangeland; and to expand wildlife areas in order to lessen the conflict are under for food and water between wildlife and cat(cid:173)tle. The program will enhance the incomes of 140,000 rural inhabitants. An $8 million credit for an integrated rural development project in Mali providing farm inputs and equipment; an expanded func(cid:173)tional literacy program; improved medical and veterinary facilities; and an agricultural research program. The program wtll reach over 100,000 farm families-some one million individuals~with agricultural services that are projected to triple their per capita incomes. A $30 million credit for a comprehensive dairy development project in India, provid(cid:173)ing for an increase in production of a million tons of milk a year, as well as for 100,000 heifers; and organizing small cattle owners into 1800 dairy cooperatives which will di(cid:173)rectly benefit some 450,000 farm families-2% million individuals-the majority of whom own holdings less than two hectares in size, or are landless. The economic return of the project is estimated at more than 30% on the capital invested. Last month the Board approved: A $10 million credit for a rural develop(cid:173)ment project in one of the poorest regions in Tanzania to enhance the productivity, in(cid:173)comes and living standards of some 250,000 people-roughly half the entire rural popu(cid:173)lation of the area-through improvements in agricultural practices and infrastructure investments for 135 newly-established vil(cid:173)lages. The project aims at doubling the per capita incomes of the villagers over a twelve(cid:173)year period. Many more similar projects preparation. For example: A project in the three northern states of Nigeria providing for the construction of 3500 kilometers of low-cost farm-to-market roads, 250 earth dams, 480 rural water supply ponds, and new marketing and credit serv(cid:173)ices. It is designed to benefit 226,000 rural families-over one and one-half million people-by raising incomes substantially above their present level of $40 per capita per year. A project in one of the poorest regions of Northeastern Brazil to raise the productivity of 33,000 farms (which support 200,000 peo(cid:173)ple) by increasing the number of extension agents; establishing demonstration farm plots; and introducing improved credit, mar(cid:173)keting, health, and education facilities. A project in India's drought-prone areas which cover 250,000 square miles, and in which 66 million people live. It alms to di(cid:173)versify their production into activities less dependent on rainfall. The project includes minor irrigation works, watershed manage(cid:173)ment, improved crop production methods, sheep and dairy development, credit facilities (especially to smallholders) , applied research, and farmer training programs. A population of over one m111ion w111 have their incomes increased as a direct result of the project. One hundred thousand man-years of addi(cid:173)tional employment will be generated. Perhaps the most comprehensive project we are working on is an effort to assist the Government of Mexico in its nationwide program of rural development. It is designed to reach the lowest income groups, and would involve a total investment of $1.2 billion over a four-year period. The program grew out of the Government's realization that al(cid:173)thoUgh the nation had achieved, over the last three decades, the highest sustained growth in agricultural production in Latin America, rural poverty appeared to have worsened in many regions throughout the country: especially in semi-arid zones. The economy had been unable to provide the growing rural population with productive employment. The thrust of the new program is to pro(cid:173)vide productive investments in low-income rural areas through small-scale irrigation, rainfed crop production, fruit and vegetable growing, and rural industries. These will ?e supported by associated investments m labor-intensive feeder road construction, water and soil conservation projects, and support services for the implementation of the Mexican land reform program. There will be provision, too, for social infrastruc(cid:173)ture, such as rural schools, water supply, health facilities, and electrification. This is, in fact, the most complex program with which the Bank has ever been associated. It is true that the risks of failure are greater in rural development projects than in some of our more traditional investments. Complicated problems of technology, orga(cid:173)nization, land tenure, and human motiva(cid:173)tion remain to be resolved. And yet for the first time we are beginning to see sub(cid:173)stantial income and employment benefits within the reach of very large numbers of the rural poor, along with high economic returns to the national economy. What is common to all these efforts within the Bank is an increased emphasis on in(cid:173)novative project design directed toward rais(cid:173)ing the productivity of the absolute poor, and toward helping them become greater participants in their country's progress. It is clear that development efforts of the past, both by governments and by the Bank, have simply not made an adequate contribution to the welfare of this huge and growing group. We must make sure that the unprec(cid:173)edented combination of events which is pres(cid:173)ently disturbing the world's economy-to which I now want to turn--does not distract our attention from this fundamental task. Ill. RECENT ECONOMIC EVENTS While the economic changes of the past year have been massive, the fact is that no one can see clearly yet either their extent or their duration. In such circumstances, projections of the future are bound to be uncertain. But they must be made if we are to initiate the long lead-time actions re(cid:173)quired to minimize the adverse effects of the changes, particularly those which are so seriously affecting many of the developing nations. In this section I want to review the scope 'and interrelated nature of these events, with particular emphasis on worldwide in(cid:173)flation; changes in the prices of petroleum and other commodities; and the impact of these changes on the outlook for economic growth in the developed nations (which constitute the principal export markets of the developing countries). This discussion wlll be followed by a review of the effects of these events on the growth prospects and capital requirements of the developing coun(cid:173)tries through the remaining years of this decade. Inflation in the developed nations There has, of course, been a significant acceleration in the rate of inflation in the developed nations. It began before the rise in the prices of petroleum and other primary commodities, and it is only partially ex(cid:173)plained by them.

The index also reflects changes in exchange rates. International prices, which had risen only 6% in the decade prior to 1968-less than 1% per year-have risen at an annual rate of nearly 10% in the five years since. The annual rate of inflation will surely decline from the 1974 level of 14% but could well average more than 7% for the period 1976-80. ",

They just arbitrarilY said, 'Now it is $11 a barrel,' and that was blackmail, Senator.\" I said, \"I am glad to hear you say that, Mr. President\"-and I do not often get to say \"Mr. President\"-! said, \"I was glad to hear you say that.\" I said, \"Let me ask you a question. You have come to us and you say to us now the new oil we are drilling for in this country we should be able to sell at $11 a barrel.\" I said, \"If it is outrageous for them to sell it at $11 a barrel, how come it is not outrageous for you to sell it at $11 a barrel?\" He said, [Laughter.] I said, \"I am not sure I understand that.\" He said, \"Competition.\" He said, \"If they are selling at $11 a barrel, we have got to sell at $11 a barrel.\" I said, \"Wait a minute. We have been telling the American people here we are not exporting oil. With whom are we competing? All the oil in the world you can produce America will buy. You can(cid:173)not produce too much for us to buy, so where is the competition?\" Now they come along and they say if HoLLINGs-by the way, Senator HoL(cid:173)LINGS, no one called me. I guess they thought I was beyond the pale. They do not even talk to me anymore. They call you and they say, \"HoLLINGS, if you are not going to let us own that deep(cid:173)water port then we are going to take our ball and we are going to go home.\" In the name of America, God bless Amer(cid:173)ica. Well, I think it is about time we showed the American people that we have got just a little bit of gumption.-! see no down side in not letting the oil companies be able to own these ports. \"Senator, market forces.\" (Mr. And, if a year from now no ports are built, assuming this passes, I will com(cid:173)mit to this body, not that it means a thing, that I will introduce an amend-. ment that says, \"OK, oil companies can build them,\" because the rationale being used here, is that they will not get built if we do not let the oil companies do it. I am saying let us test it. I appreciate being able to take so much time. I hope, for a change, we stand up and say, \"Not this time.\" The PRESIDING OFFICER HELMS). Who yields time? Mr. HOLLINGS. How much time do we have left, Mr. President? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen(cid:173)ator has 24 minutes remaining. Mr. MOSS. Just 5 minutes. Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield to the Sena(cid:173)tor from Utah. Mr. MOSS. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for yielding to me. Mr. President, I rise in support of the proposed amendment. This is a common(cid:173)sense piece of legislation whose need is clear. The Commerce Committee's hearing record documents in ample detail the anticompetitive dangers of allowing oil companies to own deepwater ports. The joint report succinctly describes these risks to competition and consequent po(cid:173)tential losses to consumers. Therefore, I shall not take up the Sen(cid:173)ate's time with a recitation of facts which have been set down with great eloquence and detail on the public rec(cid:173)ord by the Senator from South Carolina. Every Senator knows that putting the oil companies' hand on the deepwater port spigot means tightening the majors' stranglehold on the industry. The bill itself acknowledges that deep(cid:173)water ports in oil company hands are a threat to competition, by giving a pref(cid:173)erence to non-oil licensees. I ask the Senate not to stick its head in the sand and hide from the oil companies on this issue. The time has long since come when the U.S. Senate should say to \"big oil,\" \"enough.\" Some might argue that, despite anti(cid:173)competitive dangers, oil company owner(cid:173)ship must be allowed because only the oil companies will have the capital to bear the risk, construct, and maintain such facilities. To so argue would be to capitulate to blackmail. To so argue is to permit a further accretion of power in hands already too strong. The necessity of oil company ownership is a contention not borne out by the record. Others might argue that adequate pro(cid:173)tection of the public interest is secured by the preference the bill grants to non(cid:173)oil company licensees. To so argue is to acknowledge the problem but evade our responsibility to solve it. Similarly, to rely on prelicensing anti(cid:173)trust review' by executive agencies to pro(cid:173)tect the public interest is to avoid a forthright solution. None of us is blind to the influence the major oil companies hold in the councils and decisions of the Government. Why should we pretend, when facing this crucial problem,that the Federal agencies will be immune from pressures in making their antitrust de(cid:173)cisions? No one who has so much as read a newspaper the last few years would be(cid:173)lieve such a thing. To so pretend is to slough off to an(cid:173)other part of the Government, with a hope and a whistle, our responsibility to promote the public welfare. I am tired of seeing the Congress give away its powers in such a fashion. I hope that, by now, my colleagues are as well. They can show it by voting to adopt this amendment. The Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Delaware, our col(cid:173)leagues, have so eloquently stated the case that there is not much I can add. to emphasize But the thing I wanted and underline, which has been stated well by both of my colleagues, is this matter of integration that we already suffer from the oil industry. The Senator from Delaware was kind enough to mention the fact that this has been bothering me for a long time in my efforts as a consumer advocate, as chair(cid:173)man of the Consumers Subcommittee. As we looked into this oil picture, we found out that the same companies are exploring for, drilling for, producing oil and transporting it to refineries, refining it and transporting it again to the retail outlets, and selling it at the retail out(cid:173)lets, and then we find it is controlled from the very ground right to the end, and the element of competition is gone. Now, the one thing that our whole economic structure in this country is built on, and the reason we say we have the best kind of economic structure, is competition, and competition is what enables us to get the lowest price for the consumer, on the one hand, and to re(cid:173)quire efficiencies and all kinds of im(cid:173)provements along the way by the pro(cid:173)ducers and the sellers in order to deliver at the lower price. That is what we would be giving up here. I think the Senator from Delaware said it very eloquently. We already have concentration, why should we add one more facet to it, permitting the oil com(cid:173)panies to own or control the deepwater ports? If we are going to have any oppor(cid:173)tunity in this country to bring petroleum prices down or back in range of con(cid:173)sumer interests, we must do it through this competition factor. Therefore, I agree with my colleagues, both of whom have stated this so eloquently, that it is time we restored a measure of competition in this industry, at least in this facet, and also to show the people of our country, the people of the United States, that we do not simply sit back and let the oil companies go their way, the big integrated oil companies. Now, of course, they will continue to utilize this means of delivering oil to us. The bill itself recognizes that there is this element possibly of preference be(cid:173)cause it sets out the A, B, C listing and puts them finally down into the C cate(cid:173)gory. I think that is an admission that there is this element of monopoly that would intrude into the delivery of oil that is imported into this country. Therefore, I strongly support the amendment that has been offered. I ",
            "404": "34698 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE October 9, 197 4 to the exercise of new authority but rather \"a new approach to the responsiblllties we already have.\" Frankly, the purpose of this letter is ask you how such a rationale for the crea(cid:173)tion of .a. land use office within EPA and the promulgation of indirect source regulations can be rationalized in view of Congress's vote on June 11 to defeat the land use bill. It would seem to me that if EPA assumes for itself under the \"indirect source\" regulations the authority to review building plans for roads, schools, shopping centers, airports, of(cid:173)fice buildings, and parking, educational, re(cid:173)tail, commercial and industrial facilities, with the further power to reject plans or compel modifications in . building projects constructed by either private enterprise or state and loc\u00b7al governments, with the further corollary that, if the product cannot be changed to meet EPA obje\u00b7ctives, it will sim(cid:173)ply not be allowed to be bull t-EPA is pro(cid:173)ceeding in clear defiance of Congressional intent conce\u00b7rning land use planning imposed at the federal level in light of the June 11 vote. I am aware of the requirements set forth in the Clean Air Act of 1970, but I am also wondering if the promulgation of these new regulations does not exceed the author(cid:173)ity given EPA in that Act. I am sure that you can appreciate eco(cid:173)nomic dislocation that could be caused by writing and enforcing these new regulations. If builders do not meet the standards, they will have to modify their design or forego building altogether and they will be subject to fines of up to $1,000 a day from the start of construction. It seems to me that the end result could be a slowing down of construc(cid:173)tion in a period of severe unemployment in the building trades, a gradual coilSitriction of urban, rural and suburban development, and the making of construction planning far more difficult, protracted and expensive. To cite you but one example, a downtown park(cid:173)ing garage complex in Indianapolis that has the joint support of private developers and the City's Capitol Improvement Board, with a projected capacity of 2,000 cars, has been placed in serious jeopardy by the implica(cid:173)tions of Mr. Mayo's visit the other day, and his remarks have caused grea.t consternation, which, beginning as a ripple, will undoubt(cid:173)edly become a tidal wave if the Indianapolis community once again gets the idea that EPA authorities out of Chicago are coming in to Indianapolis and coercing local private developers and civic authorities into their preconceived notions about what is good fo:t the City and what is not. I realize how difficult these problems are and how caught you sometimes become be(cid:173)tween conflicting forces, but if there is any response you could make to me on the gen(cid:173)eral subject, and any specific answer you could make to my inquiry about what EPA's authority for promulgating these regulations is, I would be most grateful. With warmest personal regards and best wishes to you in the fine job you are doing under great pressure, I am Sincerely yours, WILLIAM H. HUDNUT III, Memoer of Congress. U.S. ENvmoNMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, Washington, D.C., September 11,1974. Hon. WILLIAM H. HUDNUT III, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. DEAR BILL: In your letter of August 15, 1974, you expressed concern that EPA's in(cid:173)fluence over land use is expanding to an ex(cid:173)tent which is both undesirable and unau(cid:173)thorized by Congress. Your concern is based upon two recent actions taken by the Agency, the promulgation of new indirect source re(cid:173)view regulations and the creation of a new land use office. I can appreciate your concern over the role of a Federal agency in . issues of land use which I fully agree are best addressed by local communities with full public partici(cid:173)pation. However, I would point out first that the new indirect source review regulations are necessary to meet the congressional con(cid:173)cerns expressed in passage of the Clean Air Act; and second, that this Agency fully re(cid:173)spects the primacy of State and local govern(cid:173)ment in planning for future land use. The Agency's activities in these areas are designed to further the achievement of existing man(cid:173)dates in what I trust is a more responsive manner. The Clean Air Act contemplates that much of the reduction in auto-related pollution necessary to attain and maintain national standards can be accomplished through di(cid:173)rect controls on auto emissions (Title II). implementation of Title II will While the certainly help reduce ambient levels of auto(cid:173)related pollutants, EPA has found that this program will be insufficient to insure either attainment or indefinite maintenance of standards. Indeed, Congress f<;>resaw the need for con(cid:173)trols to supplement source emission limita(cid:173)tions in Section 110 of the Clean Air Act by specifically including \"transportation and land use controls\" as mechanism which may be necessary to insure attainment and main(cid:173)tenance of health standards. New indirect sources as defined in the re(cid:173)view regulations have sufficient automotive trip-inducing capacity to create enough con(cid:173)gestion to cause localized violations of the Federal health standards. By law there must be a meohanism to prevent or otherwise con(cid:173)dition construction of such sources to in(cid:173)sure that health standards are not violated. As the preamble to the indirect source review regulations indicates, EPA expects that by using improved traffic fiow design, augmenting mass transit availability or oth(cid:173)erwise eliminating or modifying those design features which cause short-term violations of health standards, most facilities subject to the regulations will meet the require(cid:173)ments. Although the regulations are con(cid:173)cerned solely with the potential violation of ambient air quality standards, the types of changes in facility design intended to satisfy air quality requirements are almost always consistent with the achievement of other desirable effects such as customer conven(cid:173)ience and more rapid traffic fiow both in and around the proposed facility. We understand, however, that the regula(cid:173)tions could pose significant problems and costs to developers if the regulations are not fully understood and extensive project time delays are incurred. If decisionmakers, both public and private, are fully apprised of de(cid:173)sign and location considerations necessary to meet air quality standards well in ad(cid:173)vance of the permit procedure, project fi(cid:173)nancing, and plans for construction, then these regulations would be most cost-ef(cid:173)fective. We are making every effort to mini(cid:173)mize these unnecessary costs in implement(cid:173)ing the regulations. Our Office of Air and Waste Management is working with developer groups throughout the country, holding workshops, and testing the review procedures prior to the January 1 effective date. Preliminary research indicates that while the cost of design changes necessitated by the review requirements in most instances will be minimal, financial institutions un(cid:173)familiar with the new requirements may unnecessarily delay financing of question(cid:173)able projects. Therefore, we are also plan(cid:173)ning to hold workshops for mortgage bank(cid:173)ers' associations and other investment groups. Considerations of the impacts of these in(cid:173)direct source regulations as well as other regulations promulgated by the Agency prompted me to establish a new land use office within the Office of the Administra(cid:173)tor. The office, which wlll only be three or four people, will seek a fuller understanding of the impacts of the Agency's programs on State and local decision-making and will work toward making these governments the chief actors in achieving the requirements of the Clean Air Act. It will not be assum(cid:173)ing any new authority in land use but rather will be working with State and local gov(cid:173)ernments and our program offices to develop workable approaches. I hope this adequately addresses your con(cid:173)cerns. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me. Sincerely yours, RUSSELL E. TRAIN, Administrator. Mr. FRASER. Mr. Chairman, I believe it is worth noting that the legislation now before us reduces by $5 million the amount originally appropriated for the special food service programs for chi!(cid:173). dren. This program, which falls under the child nutrition section of title IV, coordinates nationwide meal distribution at day-care and summer feeding proj(cid:173)ects, along with various Head Start pro(cid:173)grams which were incorporated into it in January 1974. Originally, the conferees on H.R. 15472, which Mr. Nixon vetoed on Au(cid:173)gust 8, had allocated $30 million for the special food service programs. That amount has been cut to $25 million, thereby prohibiting expansion into new projects and even placing many exist(cid:173)ing ones in jeopardy. Furthermore, the present bill's increase of $9 million over last year's appro(cid:173)priation is deceptive, since most of the additional funds will be spent toward meeting the raise in the maximum reim(cid:173)bursement rate for program outlets which went into effect on July 1. Infla(cid:173)tion, then, not additional meal services, will be the recipient of the present increase. The Minnesota example serves to illus(cid:173)trate these points. The Department of Agriculture has informed the Minnesota program that their initial funding esti(cid:173)mate for the State for fiscal year 1975 is $660,842. This is little more than half of the State agency's actual estimate of operating costs for the year, which amounted $1,225,031. Furthermore, the Minnesota program director notes that the agency \"allows no expansion of the progra.m and does not include the $111,581 to cover approvable applications from sponsors who did not participate in the program last fiscal year, nor does it provide for potential sponsors who have not yet made application.\" Current participants in Minnesota are concerned at the budget deficiencies that will arise if the State is forced to spread its meager allotment among all of the existing pro(cid:173)grams by reimbursing sponsors at a rate far below the maximum permitted rate in this time of astronomical food prices. For a detailed analysis of the inade(cid:173)quacy of the funds now available and the administrative flaws in the present sys(cid:173)tem, refer my colleagues to Senator HUMPHREY'S statement in the April 24 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD urging a generous appropriation for this program when the original bill was debated. Mr. Chairman, I urgently hope that to I ",

            "504": "34798 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE October 9, 1974 by Fifi. Efforts to clean up and restore basic services in the more urban areas have begun. It is urgent to improve environmental sani(cid:173)tation and fac111tate early resumption of reg(cid:173)ular commercial and industrial activities. Much of this work will be done without Government of Honduras or external sup(cid:173)port. It will be done by the people of Hon(cid:173)duras. Indeed, the struggle to reestablish prior patterns of production has already started in many areas, although many peo(cid:173)ple remain dependent on relief supplies to exist. The need for emergency food supplies continues, perhaps for an average of 75,000 displaced people for, as yet, an undetermined period, but probably for at least six months. By that time, it is hoped that rehabilitation efforts will be well under way. Rehab111ta(cid:173)tion stm will imply large requirements for basic food grains, oils and supplements un(cid:173)til harvests of the next plantings are com(cid:173)pleted. Nationally, as many as 40,0QO families will need outside sources of food to survive, and very few of these have any resources to command already scarce food supplies. Avail(cid:173)able stocks of food wm not be sufficient and significant imports are seen as necessary. Basic hand implements are also necessary, along with needs, to enable small farmers to start once again their precarious existence. However basic food may be to survival, medicine and shelter are also required. Work on housing wm, of necessity, be done to a large extent on a self-help basis, much of it with salvaged materials. An estimated 5,000 to 10,000 fam111es will require assistance in obtaining construction materials in varyng quantities. While local governmental and private institutions have some of the techni(cid:173)cal and organizational sk1lls required, Hon(cid:173)duran financial resources are not sufficient for the Job at hand. The central government budget, even with inflationary credit financ(cid:173)ing, cannot increase financial resources to correspond with the problem. For the immediate future, while the emer(cid:173)gency phase continues, U.S. support for sup(cid:173)plementing Honduran and other resources for food, temporary housing, medicine, hand(cid:173)tools and other relief activities would be highly useful. The Country Team will be submitting proposals shortly for considera-tion. \u2022 V. REHABU.ITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION NEEDS The paramount problem facing Honduras is how to revive agriculture production in the shortest amount of time while providing for the tens of thousands of directly affected victi~s. Increased production w111 be re(cid:173)quired from unaffected areas (or supplies from out.side Honduras) to dampen the cer(cid:173)tain inflationary effect of the losses. The foreign exchange loss wm intensify an al(cid:173)ready critical balance-of-payments deficit. Tax revenues will fall at a time when the Government of Honduras was attempting to fund a vigorous development program. Pro(cid:173)duction losses signal rising unemployment and further losses in family income. Dam(cid:173)aged roads, bridges, and railroad tracks have to be rebuilt to allow the fiow of goods from outside the region and to transport crops that were not destroyed. The lead must come from government leadership. The coopera(cid:173)tion of the public sector with private initia(cid:173)tive will ultimately decide the success or failure of any rehab111tation and reconstruc(cid:173)tion efforts. External support from multi(cid:173)lateral and bilateral assistance can only sup(cid:173)plement the main efforts of the country 1tselt. VI. INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK TO SUPPORT GOVERNMENT OF HONDURAS SELF-HELP A. Self-help measures by the government of Honduras The Chief of State and key ministers made clear their recognition of the importance of clear evidence of continued self-help efforts by the Government of Honduras. Contem-plated are special tax measures as well as developing strategies for trade-otis between its Five-Year Development Plan and reha(cid:173)bilitation and reconstruction needs. It is clear that continued private investment in agriculture wlll have to be stimulated. The Government of Honduras will seek to identify exports that can be expanded rapidly to help to make up for foreign ex(cid:173)change losses. A basic problem is the rela(cid:173)tively short-term one of bolstering the coun(cid:173)try's foreign exchange position for the next two years. An early decision by the Honduras Government on this problem is vital, and this is recognized by the Government. It is mobilizing its talents and resources, and at the same time, is moving to secure private sector support for the very difficult recon(cid:173)struction effort. B. External assistance 1. U.S. Role Even before Hurricane Fifi, Honduras was, economically, among the three least devel(cid:173)oped countries in the Western Hemisphere. Its government had outlined a five-year na(cid:173)tional development program toward which objectives significant AID grant and loan as(cid:173)sistance has been committed. In the after(cid:173)math of the disaster, the role of U.S. assist(cid:173)ance will depend on such considerations as the country's needs for reconstruction, what the Honduras Government is doing, what other international agencies are doing and plan to do, and what could be done with existing assistance programs. Regarding the latter, we have already initiated examina(cid:173)tions with Honduran officials. Further AID assistance, beyond emer(cid:173)gency relief, should be mainly addressed to the rural sector and its poor, because it is there where the main damage and hardships were sustained. Our response should be as rapid as possible and should be quick dis(cid:173)bursing in order to obtain maximum con(cid:173)comitant balance-of-payments results. Projects financed should clearly not be competitive With those likely to interest other financial agencies. 2. Others New capital resources will assuredly be avaUable from the World Bank, the Inter(cid:173)Ainerican Development Bank, the Central American Bank for Ecdnomic Integration and the International Monetary Fund. Indeed, an IMF standby loan was in the preliminary stages of negotiation when Fifi hit. The other institutions, on the basis of preliminary discussions with the Honduras Government, have already announced a willingness to reprogram existing loans and provide new infusions of capital funds. These will be used both for rehabilitation of the infrastructure originally financed by them and reconstruction efforts, including a response to the critical balance-of-payments requirements. The Organization of American States, the United Nations family of technical agencies, as well as American and international voluntary agencies are in a position to pro(cid:173)vide technical assistance to Honduras Gov(cid:173)ernment action agencies to design and carry out short-term impact projects. In addi(cid:173)tion, the UN's Economic Commission for Latin America and the Central American Institute for Business Administration's reconstruction planning unit wlll join forces to aid the Planning Council chart Honduras' reconstruction efforts. In summary, a large variety of external assistance sources is available to assist Hon(cid:173)duras. A challenge to the Government as well as the various agencies will be the proper orchestration of efforts to assure maximum and timely effectiveness. 3. Coordination The proposals of the Government of Honduras already made to insure early in(cid:173)volvement of the international lending in-stitutions, both in assessing disaster damage and in helping the Government to plan its reconstruction effort, will exert a positive effect on future coordination. Meetings with the Minister of Finance, involving the inter(cid:173)national agencies, including AID, were held \u2022this week in Washington and follow-up sessions are planned to be held shortly in Honduras. The Honduras Government's initiative in creating a multilateral frame(cid:173)work is commendable. Continuation of COPEN's Office of Coordination of External Aid into the re(cid:173)construction phase would provide con(cid:173)tinuity. As an alternative, the office could also be made part of the National Planning Council. The Government's recent creation of a National Economic and Social Council could provide the vital national umbrella mechanism for coordinating public and private sector activities. AID will work closely with the IMF, IBRD, !DB and CABEI under a variety of possible reconstruction programs. WHY WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF EVERYTHING <Mr. CONYERS asked and was given permission to extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and to include ex(cid:173)traneous matter.) Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, President Ford's economic address to the Congress demonstrated once again that his ad(cid:173)ministration, like the Nixon administra(cid:173)tion, does not begin to appreciate the causes and complexity of our economic problems. Inflation continues to soar at the same time we are rushing headlong into depression. Yet the President con(cid:173)tinues to rely on voluntary restraint and minor adjustments in our tax structure(cid:173)approaches which will be wholly inade(cid:173)quate even with full cooperation from the Congress and the American people. Our economy requires more than minor adjustments. Instead, it requires radical surgery, based on the recognition that the domestic economy is bound inextrica(cid:173)bly to our international policies. We are now paying the price for decades of mlli(cid:173)tarism abroad and monopoly capitalism at home. As long as these policies persist, the causes of inflation and potential de(cid:173)pression will remain. The understanding missing in President Ford's address is provided by Mr. Sidney Lens, a proliflc author on both domestic and interna\u00b7 tiona! affairs. His article, which appeared in the October issue of the Progressive, follows: RUNNING OUT OF EVERYTHING (By Sidney Lens) Comedian Frank Darling says, \"The way to get prices up is to tell you there's a shortage. There's a shortage of gas, a short(cid:173)age of wheat, a shortage of paper-and the greatest shortage of all is the shortage of truth.\" One can hardly argue with this re(cid:173)flective observation. The National Association of Manufac(cid:173)turers, not celebrated for its sense of humor, last year distributed a poster that read: \"Yes, we have no bananas, steaks, eggs, blue jeans, candles, gas, tennis balls, freezers, wheat, leaJther, air oor .. ditioners, fuel on, pa(cid:173)jaxnas, floor covering, sardines, chicken, paper, hot water bottles. . . .\" The poster added a touch of whimsy to an increasingly unfunny problem. The men who did Richard Nixon's eco(cid:173)nomic thinking-Herbert Stein, Earl Butz, William Simon-were telling us a year ago that 1f we would let prices find their true higher level on the free market, we would ",

Russia bought Amer(cid:173)ican wheat in 1972 with American money. Russia borrowed the money at subsidized interest rates to purchase the wheat from the United States. We know that that cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars and we know it cost the con(cid:173)sumers many more hundreds of millions of dollars. I studied the settlement made by the State Department of the Russian lend(cid:173)lease debt, which was $2.1 billion, the total debt. The State Department nego(cid:173)tiators settled that debt at 3 cents on the dollar, plus another 24 cents provided Russia was given most-favored-nation treatment, and provided-and pro(cid:173)vided-Russia is given additional Export(cid:173)Import Bank taxpayer-subsidized credits. It is my intention when the conference report is called up today to speak at some length on this subject. I shall object to any unanimous-consent agreement in regard to it. I think the time has come to give con(cid:173)sideration to the American taxpayer. I think the time has come to call a halt to the use of the huge borrowings of the Federal Government. The more the Federal Government goes into the money market, the higher the interest rates inevitably will become. The Export(cid:173)Import Bank has to go out and borrow. this money. It has been borrowing the money at a higher percentage, and then it turns that money over to Russia at a relatively low interest rate. We know what the wage earner has to pay for interest today. The wage earner, if he or she wants to borrow money for a home, an automobile, or what have you, pays an interest rate of 12 or 14 percent, or perhaps higher. Yet this money is turned over to Russia at an interest rate of around 6 or 7 percent. I shall resist this legislation. I expect to talk at some length when it is called up today. I again ask the leadership to protect me if the Senator from Virginia happens not to be in the Chamber at the time the legislation is called up. I shall make every effort to be in the Chamber throughout the day, but if I am not here I hope my rights will be protected. Mr. President, I yield Lack the re(cid:173)mainder of my time. ORDER OF BUSINESS The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ALLEN). At this time, in accordance with the previous order, the Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator from Iowa (Mr. CLARK) for not to exceed 15 minutes. THE CURRENT OIL PRICE SITUATION Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, the oil crisis is back in the headlines. In recent appearances before the United Nations, President Ford and Secretary Kissinger emphasized the serious consequences of continued high oil prices. It was a matter of serious concern at the economic siun(cid:173)mit meeting. And in the past few we\u00b7eks a number of meetings in Washington and elsewhere have dramatized the re-newed concern of the oil importing na(cid:173)tions-rich and poor-over the serious(cid:173)ness of the situation. A year ago, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries shut off their oil exports, we were worried that we would not have enough oil to keep our economy going, and our major concern was to get the OPEC nations to start sell(cid:173)ing us oil again. It is now clear that the reopening of the oil spigot by the Arab nations has not ended the crisis brought on by the actions taken in the past year by OPEC. It may now be worse than ever. Recent meetings of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and others have made clear the concerns that, un(cid:173)less something is done to change the situation, the economies of their country and almost every other oil importing na(cid:173)tion are in serious trouble. According to some observers, it wil.lbe as bad or worse than the Great Depression of the 1930's. The high oil prices currently being com(cid:173)manded by the OPEC nations threaten to bring about economic and political chaos throughout the world by creating serious !nft.ationary pressures, by destroying what is left of the interna(cid:173)tional monetary system, by creating seri(cid:173)ous recessions or depressions in the devel(cid:173)oped nations which import oil, and by absolutely devastating the economies of the developing nations. The gravity of the situation must be understood by political leaders every(cid:173)where, because they all have a stake in what is happening. Inflation, recessions, depressions and the political, perhaps military, turmoil they bring will not be limited to a few nations. They will se(cid:173)verely damage all nations, including those who currently control the world's oil production. The immediate cause of this turmoil is the quadrupling of oil prices by the OPEC nations in recent years. This means that oil importing nations will spend $100 billion for foreign oil in 1974-5 times as much as they spent in 1972. The most obvious and immediately painful domestic manifestation of this development is inflation and all that it implies. Higher oil prices have meant reduced real incomes for nearly every(cid:173)one the United States, with espe(cid:173)cially serious consequences for those with already low incomes. They have been a major factor in the 5 percent fall in real earnings for the average worker last year. Additionally, the impact of high oil prices continues to spread through the economy, since oil is used in the pro-\u00b7 duction or distribution of almost every component of gross national product. However, as serious as this is, it is only the beginning of the problem. The high price of oil is also generating unemployment and recessions. Since the oil is :Jei::lg imported, raising its price has exactly the same effect on the level of economic activity as a tax increase. It causes unemployment by taking money out of the economy, in the same way a tax increase can cause unemployment. High oil prices, therefore, have the double-barrelled effect of simultaneously causing inflation and unemployment. Coupled with the restrictive monetary and fiscal policy brought on by inflation, this should be sufficient to cause serious recessions in many countries. This dual impact of high oil prices was one of the major concerns expressed by many of the pa:ticipants at the economic summit conference. Prospects for the developing nations are even worse. They will spend $15 bil(cid:173)lion to import oil this year, versus only $5 billion in 1972. This $10 billion differ(cid:173)ence exceeds all the foreign aid received by these countries last year. Thus, the impact of higher prices is worse than if all their foreign aid had been cut off. If we add to that the unusually high cost of food, we can see the impending disas(cid:173)ter. On top of these internal problems. there is the impact of higher oil prices on the international monetary system and on the world trade in general. We learned recently that our balance of pay(cid:173)ments ran a deficit of $2.74 billion in the second quarter of this year. Oil import-. ing countries are now running an oil deficit of $100 \"!)illion annually, and the total deficit over the next decade may reach $1 trillion. How can this deficit be paid for? It seems impossible\u00b7 that ex(cid:173)ports can be increased enough to com(cid:173)pensate for this. If the oil importing na(cid:173)tions simply increase their exports to each other, it will have no effect at all on their net balance of payments deficit, put there is the danger that a trade war will be generated by each country's try(cid:173)ing to save itself by itself. And the OPEC nations will not import enough from their oil customers to make much of a dent in this $100 billion. The most obvious solution to this would appear to be lower oil prices, and there can be little disagreement that this would help. But how much, if any, reduction in the price of imported oil is it reasonable to expect? Even a drop of $2 or $3 a barrel, which may well be the most we can realistically hope for. will still result in a continued massive oil deficit or balance of trade deficit. This is an extremely unstable situa(cid:173)tion. These huge deficits cannot con(cid:173)tinue indefinitely, but there is no guar(cid:173)antee that whatever changes do occur will result in a higher degree of economic stability or equity. To many people, worldwide economic and political chaos is inevitable, unless rapid and dramatic steps are taken to resolve these diffi(cid:173)culties. There are, however, many re(cid:173)sponsible and well informed individuals who do not accept this forecast. They be(cid:173)lieve that, while the situation is serious, with many consequences, very unpleas(cid:173)ant consequences, economic ruin is not likely. It is argued that the dislocations caused by high oil prices are so painful principally because they occurred so rapidly. If the increase had occurred gradually over a 10-year period, the world's economy would have adjusted to those changes without much diffi(cid:173)culty. At least, many would so argue. It will take a few years to adjust to the sudden increase, but the adjustment will be made, in large measure as a result of natural economic forces-the interac(cid:173)tion of supply and demand. High oil prices will lower oil imports and con(cid:173)sumption and provide great incentives for conservation, exploration for new oil, and the search for alternative sources of energy. It is impossible to do much in i~1 ",

The Commission on Government Ef(cid:173)ficiency could be the most important study group established by the Federal Government in more than a decade, and I hope for speedy action and wide sup(cid:173)port for the bill. I ask unanimous consent that a por(cid:173)tion of chapter V, \"Restoring Market Ef(cid:173)ficiency and Dealing With International Commodity Problems,\" from the Joint Economic Committee's interim report on inflation, be inserted in the REcoRD at the close of my remarks. There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: V. RESTORING MARKET EFFICIENCY AND DEAL \u2022 ING WITH INTERNATIONAL COMMODl'l'Y PROBLEMS Governments exist to serve the interests of their people. Economic systems must meet the same test. When consumers, workers and businessmen alike are subjected to serious inflation because of structural distortions in the economy, such distortions must be !removed. To do otherwise creates doubt about the abil1ty of the economy to respond to the needs of the people. There is abundant evidence that struc(cid:173)tural distortions are a major contributing factor to our current economic problems. These distortions exist in both the public and private sectors. They hamper the free flow of goods and services both domestically and internationally, restrict and in some cases totally eliminate competition, impose high costs on the consumer and the average businessman, and retard technological prog(cid:173)ress. While It 1s not possible to measure precisely the additional cost imposed on consumers by structural distortions, esti(cid:173)mates run into billions of dollars annually. OMNIBUS LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN COMPETITION This chapter discusses a number of spe(cid:173)cific structural problems requiring attention, especially in the energy and agriculture sec(cid:173)tors. It is scarcely possible, however, for us to review all the myriad reform needed. Special machinery must be set up, not only to identify these reforms, but to insure that the administrative and legislative action necessary to implement these reforms is not delayed. In the public sector, Federal policies, reg(cid:173)ulations, subsidies, import quotas, tariffs and price supports pose innumerable ob(cid:173)stacles to a smoothly running market econ(cid:173)omy. For example because of Interstate Commerce Commission [ICC] regulations, a truck, after carrying goods from one city to another, may be required to return empty. Partly a.s a. result of other ICC rules, railroad cars travel about 50 percent of their mileage with no freight. Costly building codes need to be eliminated and could be if the proposed National Institute for Building Sciences were funded. Federal bailouts of large corporations with financial difficulties discourage efficient business practices. Gov(cid:173)ernment procurement practices encourage waste and increase costs. Federal subsidy pro(cid:173)grams, inluding tax subsidies, were estimated to have cost more than $63 billion in 1970 and have almost certainly grown appreciably since then. In the private sector, industrial concentra(cid:173)tion, collusive practices, administered prices, exorbitant profits and anticompetitive be(cid:173)havior must bear a large part of the respon(cid:173)sib111ty for the current inflation. The price increases in the industries where there Is a high degree of concentration have been steep. Wholesale prices arose in the past 12 months by the following amounts: fuels and related products and power, 67 percent; chemicals and allied products, 43 percent; rubber and plastic products, 27 percent; metals and metal products, 39 percent; machinery and equipment, 18 percent. Individual industries within these commodity groupings, such as petroleum, coal, and steel raised their prices at even higher rates. Artificial barriers to employment-age, sex, and race discrimination, excessive formal ed(cid:173)ucation requirements, difficulties in obtain(cid:173)ing union membership-also push up costs in the private sector. Many of these prac(cid:173)tices are already illegal under Federal law, but some laws may need strengthening and there certainly needs to be more adequate en(cid:173)forcement. There is a connection between concentra(cid:173)tions of economic power and government laws and regulations which subsidize inefficient operations and interfere with competition. Structural problems in the public sector and those in the private sector are related. More(cid:173)over, concentrations of economic power, to(cid:173)gether with the misuse of political power, have frustrated most efforts to enforce the antitrust laws. A Commission should be appointed jointly by Congress and the President to recommend comprehensive legislation to eliminate both governmental and private barriers to an effi(cid:173)cient market economy. In making its leglsla\u00b7 tive recommendation the Commission should carefully consider the eliminat:on, retention or modlfica tion of: Federal subsidies. Production quotas and marketing orders. Price supports. Excess stockpiles. Prevailing wage determinations. Excessive or inept regulation of transporta(cid:173)tion and communication. Import quotas and voluntary agreements to curtail imports. Retatl price maintenance, and other simllar governmental impediments to economic em(cid:173)ciency. The Commission should also consider the strengthening of private competition through actions such as: Divestiture and reorganization. Improved antitrust laws and administra(cid:173)tion, including the transfer of enforcement responsib111ty to an independent agency. Removal of artificial barriers to employ(cid:173)ment. The Commission should also consider the provision of adjustment assistance for groups of workers severely affected by the transition to a more competitive economy. The Commission should report within 6 months of its establishment. In appointing the Commission, the President and the con(cid:173)gressional leadership should make an ad(cid:173)vance commitment to introduce the Commis(cid:173)sion's recommendations in Congress immedi\u00b7 ately in the form of omnibus legislation am.d to give it prompt consideration. By Mr. JAVITS: S. 4119. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to raise the total amount which may be expended for cer(cid:173)tain social services, and to provide for the reallotment of funds which would otherwise not be used. Referred to the Committee on Finance. Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I intro(cid:173)duce the Emergency Social Services Amendments of 1974, a bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act, to in(cid:173)crease the availability of social services for the poor and others during the pe(cid:173)riod of projected economic hardship. This measure is a special emergency authority designed to increase the avail-ability of social services for the poor and others who could otherwise fall into the \"poor\" or \"near poor\" category or face other hardships as a result of in(cid:173)flation and other elements of the eco(cid:173)nomic crisis by-Increasing the social services ceiling, set nationally at $2.5 billion, to $4.0 btl(cid:173)lion during each of the fiscal years 1975 and 1976; and Providing for redistribution of social services funds from States that do not use their allocations to States which re(cid:173)quire and can effectively use more funds than allocated, to meet the special needs of their citizens. Mr. President, following upon his earlier statements that he would meet the problems of those hardest hit by inflation and any down-tum \"with compassion,\" President Ford, as the fifth point in his economic address to the Congress this past Tuestday, stressed: \"Helping the casualties.\" But his program to do so-while great in spirit-is inadequate in provision. During this period of economic crises-which the President des\u00b7cribes as ending with the Bicentennial, thus through fiscal year 1976-the poor and others in need are going to be hit by what one economist has called \"stag(cid:173)flation,\" high unemployment coupled with high inflation. To meet the first of these enemies of the poor, the President has proposed an expanded program of unemployment benefits and a new Community Improve(cid:173)ment Corps, providing public service employment. The administration's unemployment program is clearly inadequate in terms of the amounts of funds to be available(cid:173)an aggregate of $2.2 billion for about 300,000 jobs-using a cost of $7,000 per annum-if unemployment reaches a level of 7 percent nationally-for 3 consecutive months-compared with $4.0 billion for 500,000 public service jobs(cid:173)using a cost of $8,000 per annum-at 6 percent national unemployment which I have proposed, with 14 cosponsors, in S. 2993, the Emergency Energy Employ(cid:173)ment Assistance Act of 1974. The admin(cid:173)istration's plan is also questionable in that it would be administered through a new program insufficiently tied to the very successful mechanism of State and local prime sponsorship established under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973. Moreover, it is only a 1-year authority, although the crisis, in the President's own words, is likely to last for 2 fiscal years. But be that as it may-and I shall fight to insure that it is not \"as it may,\" but as it \"should be\"-joblessness is only one of the hardships that the \"casual(cid:173)ties\" are facing and will face. The second is inflation itself, as Presi(cid:173)dent Ford noted in his address to the Congress: Now, I know that low-income and middle(cid:173)Income Americans have been hardest hit by Inflation. Their budgets are most vulnerable because a l\u00b7arger part of their income goes for the highly infiated costs of food, fuel and medical care. To address this situation-which was considered so heavily by the HEW panel ",

It ought to be apparent to Mr. Rosen-feld and to Mr. Glazer, whom he quotes, that if the a.ssimilationist ideology is under strain, it is reality which has strained it. The \"current wave of ethnic feeling\" has not caused the weakening of the \"com(cid:173)mon American glue,\" but is a symptom at it, and serves as well to demonstrate that the apparent strength of the \"glue\" in the past was partly illusion. I can agree with Mr. Rosenfeld that the public schools have a respons1b111ty to \"in-culcate a full understanding of the child's American heritage.\" But I must quickly add that when a country is estwblished by Euro(cid:173)pean settlers on the land of indigenous residents, built through the work of slaves imported from Africa, and then populated and developed by immigrants from all over the world, its \"inheritance\" is precisely that of world history and culture. The only er\u00b7 ror of the \"wave which carried bilingual(cid:173)ism into public policy\" is the notion that the cultural heritage of one group belong only to that group and that they alone should be taught it. Certainly in this day when everyone is making obligatory bows to \"interdependence,\" it's odd that anyone should still feel that America has either a heritage or a destiny that can be separated from that of the rest of the world. BARBARA J. FIELDs. A TEACHER'S VIEW WASHINGTON. I read with some dismay Mr. Rosenfeld's piOUS defense of the exploitation Of the minority by the majority. As a born Spanish speaker, who has studied the development of languages, the cultural and historical growth of federalism in these United States, and at-tempted to teach standard English or Spanish to children ravaged by their early years of schooling in the Southwest, I state with some authority that his concerns are baseless. The Indian, Spanish and French cultures and languages ante-date the rise of English in this country. Yet, for many years the state governments have been waging a war against these languages and cultures only a little less harsh than that waged against blacks here, and Jews in Germany.

Mr. President, recently an article by Mr. Stephen S. Rosenfeld appeared in the Washington Post en-titled \"Bilingualism and the Melting Pot.\" As a cosponsor of S. 2552 and S. 2553, both of which dealt with the sub-t. d ject of bilingual educa 1on, an were eventually incorporated into Public Law 93-380, I was concerned that the opin-ions of such a widely read columnist will go unchallenged. Fortunately, this has not happened. In today's edition of the Washington Post, a number of letters to the editor appeared challenging the opinion of Mr. Rosenfeld. In the interest of apprising those throughout the Nation who read the original article but who do not have access to the rebuttals printed in the washington Post, I request unanimous consent that they be printed in the REc-ORD. They are most worthy of the dis-tribution such action will provide. There being no objection, the letters were Ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as fOllOWS: .

Mr. TALMADGE. Indeed not. In fact, several of the Conferees felt \u00b7that i\u00b7t would be de(cid:173)sirable for the Commission to require report(cid:173)ing on the time of each \u2022trade made as soon as it is practical for the exchanges to provide this information. The Conferees made this section discretionary, in keeping with many other provisions of the bill. It was our feel(cid:173)ing that we were not the ultimate experts on commodity futures .trading and tha.t we should give the maximum amount of dis(cid:173)cretion possible to the Commissioners, who wlll be true experts. It is expected and hoped th91t the Commission will require whatever information that is necessary to allow \u00b7the Commission to do an adequate job of pollcing abuses.

I would like to ask my distin(cid:173)guished friend and Chairman of the Agri(cid:173)culture Committee a clarifying question on the nature of .the new Commission and its relationship \u00b7to .the Department of Agricul(cid:173)ture. As I understand Section 101 of the Act and the Report of the Conferees, the estab(cid:173)Ushment of liaison offices by the Commission and the Depar.tment of Agriculture simply takes note of the importance of agricultural commodities and the knowledge of the De(cid:173)partment of these commodities. Am I cor(cid:173)rect, Mr. Chairman, that the liaison agreed. to by the Conferees is primarlly an informa(cid:173)tional one and in no way affects the inde(cid:173)pendence of the Commission? Mr. TALMADGE. Yes, \u00b7the Senator is quite correct in his understanding of the liaison provision. Mr. CLARK. Am I also correct, Mr. Chair(cid:173)man, in stating that nothing in the Act pro(cid:173)hibits the Commission from establishing simllar liaison offices with other government agencies? Mr. TALMADGE. The Senator is correct. There is nothing at all to prohibit the Commission from establishing similar liaison offices wi\u00b7th other agencies. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, the con(cid:173)ference report now before the Senate is dit!erent from the original bill passed by this body more in form than in sub(cid:173)stance. The major dit!erence that the com(cid:173)mittee on conference was faced with was between a part-time commission con(cid:173)nected with the Department of Agricul(cid:173)ture as provided in the House bill and a full-time, five-member, independent commission as provided in the Senate bill. The conferees agreed upon the Commission as provided in the Senate bill with a provision that liaison offices be established between the Commission and the Department of Agriculture. Mr. President, I fully support the con(cid:173)ference report and hope that it will be unanimously endorsed by this body but would again like to reiterate the state(cid:173)ment I made during Senate debate on this measure by expressing my hope that the new Commission we are creat(cid:173)ing does not become \"an over-regulatory\" agency. Mr. President, the commodity futures markets can be an important tool for producers and primary users of agricul(cid:173)tural commodities and other raw mate(cid:173)rials.

            "754": "35048 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE October 10, 197 4 I I believe that we must at least take one modest step to provide jobs now. Those out of work and their families frankly cannot wait until a new authori(cid:173)zation and long and extended hearings take place. They cannot wait until the Spring of 1975 to provide at least a minimum level of new public service jobs or public serv(cid:173)ice job opportunities. I think we have to recognize that one of the most difficult periods for the unemployed is in the winter months. Some may suggest that our $500 mil(cid:173)lion proposed, to add 71,000 public em(cid:173)ployment opportunities, may be, as has been said, just gilding the lily. In other words, it does not really get at the big problem. But I remind my colleagues that this is at the exact level which was proposed by President Ford to Congress 2 days ago. I ask my colleagues has the Presi(cid:173)dent ever been accused of lily-gilding? I do not think so. The point is that these jobs will help '11,000 families this winter when the help will be most needed. Some may argue that the added $500 million would be inflationary. I ask my colleagues is it more inflationary to spend nearly the same amount of money to take care of these families on welfare? Obviously, our economy is much better off if we can put at least a small portion of the unemployed to useful, constructive public work. think the people of the country are really kind of tired of our empty promises, and this is exactly what the President's public employment proposal will be at least until next spring, unless we can act, and act promptly. All of the available public service job funding will provide approximately 160,-000 jobs this winter; that is, everything that has been appropriated thus far by all of the actions of Congress. This will go down to about 130,000 jobs next spring when unemployment, hopefully, is ex(cid:173)pected to be going in the opposite direc(cid:173)tion. Our proposal will add 71,000 jobs im(cid:173)mediately, 14,000 of which will go direct(cid:173)ly to areas with unemployment rates of 6.5 percent or worse. Mr. President, to put this proposal in proper perspective, I would point out that the 71,000 jobs we propose to offer account for less than 20 of the jobs lost in the 4 short weeks in September. This is a minimal, modest proposal, and it is essential, absolutely essential. I would like to note that I discussed the urgent need for an expanded public service employment program this morn(cid:173)ing with Dr. Arthur Burns, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, as he testified before the Joint Economic Committee to(cid:173)day. I specifically asked him if he would support immediate addition to the Na(cid:173)tion's public service job program of about $500 million, an addition that would re(cid:173)sult in the creation of 71,000 jobs now. Mr. President, I am pleased to report that Dr. Burns, who is considered to be a rather conservative man and a prudent man, fully endorsed the immediate fund(cid:173)ing of such a public service jobs program. No one in this country is more con-I cerned about inflation in our economy than Dr. Burns, and no one, I believe, has given us more lectures on the subject and more constructive advice. Given his endorsement of the Hum(cid:173)phrey-Javits proposal, I feel that every Senator can be assured of the responsible and prudent nature of the measure be(cid:173)fore us. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing this modest but urgently needed response to the cry of despair from the rapidly growing legions of the unemployed. Let me read into the RECORD the testi(cid:173)mony of this morning's exchange before the Joint Economic Committee between Dr. Arthur Burns and myself. I asked Dr. Burns, \"Would you agree, in view of the rising unemployment, up 700,000 since January, and projected to rise to 800,000 or 900,000 by Christmas, that this is the time to set in motion the machinery for public service employment at an expanded rate?\" Prior to this, by the way, I had dis(cid:173)cussed with, had mentioned to, Dr. Burns, the amendment that Senator JAVITS and I now have before the Senate. Dr. Burns said, \"I agree with that, yes.\" In earlier testimony he said, \"First, I am delighted that the President has seen fit to recommend a new public service program to the Congress and, second, if I were doing it personally I would have recommended a slightly larger figure.\" Now, Mr. President, what this amend(cid:173)ment does is to take President Ford's proposal and bring it here today. We know what the problem is, we know the number of unemployed, we know that since the last action of Congress 400,000 more unemployed have been added to the long list. It proposes, in other words, to try to do something to meet the current situatioo. I also have a letter from the National League of Cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors supporting this measure and noting that it is certainly consistent with President Ford's funding recommenda(cid:173)tion as stated in his message to Congress earlier this week. I ask unanimous consent that that let(cid:173)ter be printed in the REcoRD. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: OCTOBER 10, 1974. Hon. HUBERT H. HUMPHREY, Executive Vtce President, National League of Cities. JOHN J. GUNTHER, Executive Director, U.S. Conference of Mayors. U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR HUMPHREY: Qn behalf Of the nation's cities, we endorse your amend(cid:173)ment to the FY 75 Supplemental Appropria(cid:173)tion increasing funds for Titles I and ll of CET A by $500 million. While this is certainly consistent with President Ford's funding rec(cid:173)ommendation as stated in his message Congress earlier this week, it is also justifled by the ever-increasing unemployment in our cities. Unless immediate additional sources of funds for public service jobs are made available, local governments wlll not be able to meet their responsibllities to the unem(cid:173)ployed. We support your efforts and urge the Sen(cid:173)ate to adopt your proposal. Sincerely, ALLEN E. PRITCHARD, Jr., to Mr. HUMPHREY. I also ask unani(cid:173)mous consent, Mr. President, that the letter that was circulated by Senator JAVITS and myself to our colleagues in the Senate explaining in more detail title I and title II of the comprehensive man(cid:173)power training program, the Compre(cid:173)hensive Employment and Training Act, be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: U.S. SENATE, Washington, D.C., October 10, 1974. DEAR COLLEAGUE: When the Supplemental Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1975 comes to the fioor, we intend to offer an amend(cid:173)ment to add an aggregate of $500 million to the bill for public service employment pro(cid:173)grams under the Comprehensive Employ(cid:173)ment and Training Act of 1973 (CETA). No funds are presently included in the Supple(cid:173)mental for this purpose. Our amendment consists of the following: $400 m1llion for approximately 57,000 transitional public service jobs (at the Com(cid:173)mittee's estimate of $7,000 per annum per job) to be provided by some 400 State and local governmental prime sponsors under title I of CETA. (As passed by the Senate, the HEW-Labor appropriations bill for fiscal year 1975, now in Conference with the House, authorizes $1,505,000,000 for title I, of which $155,000,000 is intended by the Senate to provide approximately 22,000 pub(cid:173)lic service jobs. The House provided $1,680,-000,000 for title I, which funds prime spon(cid:173)sors may use at their discretion for public service jobs or job training.) $100 million for approximately 14,000 transitional public service employment op(cid:173)portunities for areas of \"substantial unem(cid:173)ployment\" (areas having an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent for more than three con(cid:173)secutive months) under title II of the Act, (Under the HEW-Labor Appropriations, as passed by the Senate, $400,000,000 would be available for approximately 57,000 jobs; the House bill provided $350,000,000, the amount of the Administration's request, for approxi(cid:173)mately 50,000 jobs.) We consider these additional funds to be crucial in Ugh t of the increase in the na(cid:173)tional unemployment rate from 5.4 per(cid:173)cent in August with 4.9 persons unemployed, to 5.8 percent in September with 5.4 mill1on unemployment. Many experts, economists, and offi.cials in the Administration have pre(cid:173)dicted levels even higher, perhaps even as high as 6.0 percent, by the end of the year. Combined with our request, carried over fiscal year 1974 funds for public service em(cid:173)ployment, and those that would be available under the Senate version of the HEW-Labor Appropriations b111, an aggregate of about $1.5 b111ion for aproximately 226,000 public service job opportunties could be provided in this fiscal year. Yet that amount would reach only about 5.6 percent of the 5.4 mlllion currently un(cid:173)employed. Experience under the public employment program (\"PEP\") conducted under the Emergency Employment Act of 1971, and more recently through the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973, dem(cid:173)onstrates that transitional public service em(cid:173)ployment programs can provide meaningful, not \"dead-end\" employment for the unem(cid:173)ployed, and meet real, not \"make-work\" pub(cid:173)He servtce needs; most crucially, testimony before the Subcommittee on Employment, Poverty and Migratory Labor indicates that appropriated funds can be translated into worthwhile jobs within thirty days of alloca(cid:173)tion. This amendment will be otrered as a modi(cid:173)ftcation to our original Amendment# 1957 to the Supplemental Appropriations Act (see attached). ",

LOUVAIN DECLARATION: WORLD CONFERENCE ON RELIGION AND PEACE Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, this summer the Second World Conference on Religion and Peace met at the Univer(cid:173)sity of Leuven;Louvain in Belgium. I be(cid:173)lieve my colleagues will be interested in the final declarataion of that Conference, adopted on September 3 of this year, and 'I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the declara(cid:173)tion was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: THE LOUVAIN DECLARATION 1 \"I WALK ON THORNS, BUT FIRMLY, AS AMONG FLOWERS\" The Second World Conference on Religion :and Peace, meeting at the University o! Leuven/Louvain 1n the summer of 1974,longs \u00b7to speak directly to all the religious commu(cid:173)_nities of our troubled planet. Buddhists, Christians, Confucianists, Hin(cid:173)<dus, Jains, Jews, Muslims, Shintoists, Sikhs, 1 Adopted by the Second World Conference on Religion and Peace on September 8, 1974, .at Louvain (Leuven), Belgium. Zoroastrians and still others, we have sought here to listen to the spirit within our varied and venerable religious traditions. Whatever our religion, we know that we are one with the whole of humanity and that all of its problems are our problems. Our faith com(cid:173)pels us to search for effective, viable solutions.\u00b7 We have faced together the enormity of the perils presently threatening the human spe(cid:173)cies and its home. We have looked hard at the massive evidence of the political, eco(cid:173)nomic, social and cultural offenses against humanity that are inherent in the growing world disorder. We have grappled with the towering issues that our societies must re(cid:173)solve in order to bring about peace, justice and an ennobling quality of life for every person and every people. Drawing upon the inexhaustible resources of our several spiri(cid:173)tual heritages, we have experienced together the truth expressed by one of the poets in our midst: \"I walk on thorns, but firmly, as among flowers.\" Our debt to the historic First World Con(cid:173)ference on Religion and Peace, held in Kyoto, Japan, in 1970, is very great and gratefully acknowledged. High standards for the min(cid:173)istry of peace and justice in all religions and lands were set forth at Kyoto, and here in Louvain, we have been able to go forward because of their guidance. Of all the things learned at Kyoto, none has marked us more deeply than the discovery that the integrity of the commitment of each to his own reli(cid:173)gious tradition permits, indeed nurtures, lov(cid:173)ing respect for the prayer and faithfulness of others. We have contemplated together the inalienable dignity of every human being, as it is affirmed by each of our traditions. We rejoice that through the profound ex(cid:173)periences of conferences like these, and multi-lateral dialogues undertaken by official religious institutions, the long era of pride(cid:173)ful, and even prejudiced, isolation of the religions of humanity is, we hope, now gone forever. We are resolved henceforth to serve humanity together each in the way most in keeping with the convictions of his spiritual family and local circumstances. WAR CANNOT BE AVOIDED: IT CAN ONLY BE OVERCOME Peace can no longer be regarded as an ideal which may be cherished or discarded at wm. It is a practical and immediate neces(cid:173)sity arising out of the present situation where men have acquired such immense power that they are now in a position to conquer the stars or to annihilate themselves completely .along with the globe they live on. We therefore dedicate ourselves to work together for the total abolition of war. We plead with all people of faith and good will to recognize that there is no future for humanity if worldwide nuclear war is simply postponed or temporarily avoided. The deli(cid:173)cate \"balance of terror\" has given the super(cid:173)powers, and all other nations with them, nothing more than a reprive-a little time to concert action to end the nuclear arms race. We urge that the religions of the world mount every possible pressure on the nuclear weapon governments to halt the proliferation of destructive nuclear armament and to roll back all existing nuclear weaponry until the stockpiles of nuclear devices have been safety dismantled and destroyed. We also ask religious bodies to press other govern(cid:173)ments now capable of initiating nuclear weapons programs to renounce any such undertaking. In the four years since our Kyoto Con(cid:173)ference, we confess that we have not known how to mobilize religious people so that they might contribute effectively to the preven(cid:173)tion of even limited local or civil wars. Bangladesh, the Middle East, Northern Ire(cid:173)land, the Southern Ph111ppines, Southern Africa, Cyprus and Indochina are among those places where the conflicting forces, including the political decisionmakers, are largely composed of members of our various religious communities. With utmost grief we recognize that the Indochina War was not ended by the Paris Peace Agreements of January 1973, and that another hundred thousand Indochinese lives have been lost since that disappointing \"peace\" was declared. We understand and re(cid:173)spect the Vietnamese Buddhist campaign cry: \"Don't shoot your own brother.\" Wherever wars are now going on, we ex(cid:173)press our deep sorrow over the suffering of all who are involved even as we call upon them and their governments to seek alternative solutions through negotiation, mediation or arbitration, as well as to strive for impera(cid:173)tive political, economic, social, cultural and moral change by means more appropriate to their respect for life and their vision of human destiny. Whatever conscientious religious people decide in respect to the use of violence, we urge religious leaders everywhere to work ceaselessly for the reduction of the level of violence in all social struggles, in the first instance, with the final elimination of vio(cid:173)lence in favor of peaceful solutions as their firm objective. To respond to violence with violence without first seeking to eliminate its cause is to embark upon the course of unending escalation. Conscientious objectors to all kllling and all wars have lately arisen in increasing num(cid:173)bers in most of our religious traditions. We ask the official organizations of all religions to respect their witness as a prophetic sign that ultimately mankind must indeed end war, or war will end mankind. Religion should so interpret conscientious objectors to govern(cid:173)ment, insisting on the recognition of their rights. LIBERATION PLUS DEVELOPMENT= PEACE Peace is a supreme value for all religions, a state of personal and social existence that, according to all prophets and teachers, is fa.r more than mere absence of conflict. The world without war envisaged by our seers is warless because of its health, its wholeness, its intrinsic justice, its at-one-ness with the universe. Therefore, those who truly seek the peace of the nations should begin with the rigorous spiritual disciplines that bring peace in their own hearts, peace in their families, peace in their cities, and peace with the natural world. Such peace is not possible for men and women unless they learn to master themselves, sublimate their combative ener(cid:173)gies into productive channels, refuse to accept enslavement in any form, and freely offer themselves in the service of their fellow(cid:173)men and their eternal lord. We have come to see human liberation, economic development and world peace as a dynamic triangular process. People liberat(cid:173)ing themselves become capable of helping others become free. A truly free people con(cid:173)stitutes a productive and cooperative so(cid:173)ciety rather than an exploitative and dom(cid:173)ineering overlord among their neighborhood. All the inhabitants of the globe today need to progress toward such basic liberation, such genuine self-development, such a harmoni(cid:173)ous and peaceful world order. Tyrannical systems, elitist ruling groups and some transnational economic enterprises-whether private or governmental-prevent multitudes of people from participating in the shaping of their own future. We encourage every re(cid:173)ligion to arouse its people to seek resolutely their own integrated liberation and devel(cid:173)opment, and that of their fellow human beings, near and far. With special insistence we turn to those religious communities that are numerous among the aftluent and power(cid:173)ful nations, requesting that they act boldly to end every form of domination among the African, Asian and Latin American peoples whether by their governments or their eco(cid:173)nomic and cultural institutions. We press religious people to condemn profiteering by ",
            "854": "35148 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE October 10, 1971, funds to be raised from the dollar check(cid:173)off fund of individual tax contributions. This important amendment was defeated in the House and was not included in the final version of the bill agreed upon by the House and Senate conferees. One of the most important provisions of the legislation before us is the crea(cid:173)tion of a strong and independent Fed(cid:173)eral Elections Commission which will oversee all Federal elections and be em(cid:173)powered to enforce the new law by sub(cid:173)penaing witnesses, conducting investi(cid:173)gations of campaign abuses, and by bringing civil suits to court. Of monumental importance in reform(cid:173)ing the election process are the campaign spending limitations and contribution limitations included in the bill. The pro(cid:173)visions of the Federal Election Campaign Act amendments achieve new and real(cid:173)istic limits to campaign spending. Reasonable restrictions on individual and group contributions to congressional or Presidential candidates limit individ(cid:173)ual contributions to $1,000 per candidate in the primary and in the general elec(cid:173)tion with an aggregate limitation of $25,000 to all candidates and political committees during a 2-year period. An organization is prohibited from contributing more than $5,000 to any one candidate for Federal office in the primary election and also in the general election. Congress cannot take full credit for these essential campaign reforms. Or(cid:173)ganizations such as Common Cause, the Center for Public Financing, and the National Committee for an Effective Congress were major catalysts in con(cid:173)vincing Congress of the urgency of these measures. The Federal Election Campaign Act amendments are designed to fortify the very roots of our democratic system(cid:173)our electora1 process. I hope this re(cid:173)form therapy will be effective. Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this conference report. Through the enactment of these Fed(cid:173)eral Election Campaign Act amend(cid:173)ments, we can help bring about funda(cid:173)mental improvements in the way in which America chooses its elected lead(cid:173)ership. I especially want to commend the House conferees who did such an excel(cid:173)lent job in representing the position of the House while working toward a strong reform bill that can become law this year. Mr. Speaker, with respect to the issue of public financing for congressional campaigns, which constituted one of the major points of controversy between the two bodies, I want to thank our conferees for their successful advocacy of the House position. I believe it would be premature, to say the least, for the law to provide public financing for all Federal election campaigns, when we have not yet had any actual experience with public financing. We at least owe the American taxpayer the consideration of evaluating the re(cid:173)sults from the public financing of Presi(cid:173)dential campaigns, which this bill man(cid:173)dates, before we begin to charge him for all Federal campaign costs. This only makes sense, Mr. Speaker, and I am relieved that the House position has been retained in this very important respect. Let public financing achieve in practice the lofty goals which its advocates fore(cid:173)cast, before extending it to all Federal campaigns. Mr. Speaker, this legislation will give a real boost to the public's right to know in the campaign area with its admirable plugging of several old loopholes in the financial disclosure provision of the Fed(cid:173)eral Election Campaign Act. Campaign finances will be even more completely open to public inspection than at present so that the voter may examine the fi(cid:173)nancial aspects of a candidate's support. The disclosure provisions of this confer(cid:173)ence report will insure that much more information than is now required will be fully avallable for public scrutiny and assessment. However, the measure has two egre(cid:173)gious defects. First, it fails to require ac(cid:173)countability with regard to labor orga(cid:173)nizations and other political action groups regarding individual contribu(cid:173)tions-and in such cases, it does not re(cid:173)quire the identity of persons making con(cid:173)tributions, and fails to designate the can(cid:173)didates whom the various contributors desire to support. It leaves those decisions up to the labor leaders-or organizations' officers. Second, the measure fails to measure in terms of campaign contributions the extensive services provided in the form of campaign workers, and telephone teams, and such personal services as are regularly provided by labor organiza(cid:173)tions in support of. their favorite candi(cid:173)dates. These defects should have been cor(cid:173)rected and, in any event, should be the subject of further legislation at an early date. Mr. MATSUNAGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference re(cid:173)port to accompany S. 3044, the proposed Federal Election Act Amendments of 1974. The legislation before the House today represents literally years of work by many dedicated people both in and out of Congress. It is our best and most con(cid:173)structive response to the terrible abuses of Watergate. I congratulate the gentle(cid:173)man from Ohio <Mr. HAYS) and the other hard-working members of his committee, for the fine job they did on this land(cid:173)mark bill. In my judgment, S. 3044 represents a major step forward. While I regret that public financing was not extended to House and Senate election, I believe the legislation before us today will lay the groundwork for public financing of all Federal elections. The conference report provides for a strong and independent commission to oversee all Federal elections and the Fed(cid:173)erallaws pertaining to them. It also pro(cid:173)vides for reasonable limits on both cam(cid:173)paign contributions and campaign spend(cid:173)ing. This is certainly a welcome new change in our election laws. Most significantly, by adoption of the pending conference report and final pas(cid:173)sage of the bill, S. 3044, we will have insured that Presidential campaigns will not be dependent on huge gifts of money. from special interest .groups or individ-uals. We will have eliminated a major weakness in our elections which led to Watergate. No one can seriously doubt that the passage of the pending Federal Elections Campaign Act amendments will help re(cid:173)store the faith of the American people in their Government, a faith which has, perhaps, been strained more by the events of the past 2 years than at any other time in our history, We will, by passage of this act, restore the seriously damaged linkage between the electorate and elected public officials. The bill is by no means a panacea for our election ills, but it certainly is the right medicine at this crucial moment for an ailing system. I urge the adoption of the conference report. Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, I move the previous question on the conference re(cid:173)port. The previous question was ordered. The SPEAKER. The question is on the conference report. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes ap(cid:173)peared to have it. RECORDED VOTE Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered.

Have we never heard of shyster lawyers convincing these poor in(cid:173)dividuals they got a tremendous deal, when the lawYer is going to get a piece of the action? I do not blame the Indians for think(cid:173)ing they were \"etting some remunera(cid:173)tion and they they had not given up their claim to the land. ask that we pass this bill. I ask that we reject any amendment to this bill as it applies to these Indians. Give them the land and with it their pride. Mr. TAYLOR of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the dis(cid:173)tinguished gentleman from Washington (Mr. MEEDS). Mr. Chairman, will yield? Mr. MEEDS. I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. TAYLOR of North Carolina. In response to a statement made just now by the gentleman from California, let me state there are about 250 Indians living on the 518 acres, but they also have in addition to the reservation some 2,540 acres which is in an entirely dif~ ferent location. They also Have the right to use the land for traditional uses, that is, for grazing, hunting, fishing, bury(cid:173)ing the dead and their burial grounds, 250,000 acres which is part of the Grand Canyon National Park and no one pro(cid:173)poses to take this right away from them. We intend to let them have these tra~ ditional rights. If we are setting a precedent let it be that justice is done-Mr. MEEDS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to address myself to one aspect of this matter at this time, that is what the Havasupai gave up and what they thought they were giving up in the ac(cid:173)ceptance of the award of the Indian Claims Commission. The gentleman from Washington (Mr. FoLEY) is absolutely correct. In 1946, when the Indian Claims Commission Act was passed, it was an effort to give money for land and, therefore, the Claims Com(cid:173)mission was prevented from giving the Havasupai Indians this land as an award. They, however, relying upon a 1942 Interior Department decision and opinion. felt that their title was not ex(cid:173)tinguished; but even at that, in their dealings with the people who passed the act under which they took the money for their claim at 50 cents an acre, they depended upon those people to pass special legislation for them which would give them their land. Everyone who had dealt with this matter and who has looked at the record will find very clearly that the intention of Senator FANNIN from the other body and all the other people who worked on that matter at that time clearly intended to come in with special legislation which gave the Havasupai some land, because this could not be done by the Indian Claims Com(cid:173)mission. Therefore, the Havasupai took their claim. But what did they do with it? They refused to accept at 50 cents an acre the money which is covered by the land we are here talking about, out of a claim for 2,500,000 acres that they had. They have refused to accept the money for years now, and that ought to be very clear evidence of their intent that they never intended to lose the title to this land. The record of the hearings in the other body, the record of the markup is very clear that, as soon as that claim was settled and paid, it was the intention of the sponsors of the leg(cid:173)islation on the other side to come in with such legislation giving the Hava(cid:173)supai title to the land we are here talk(cid:173)ing about; land which, incidentally, they have lived on for over 1,000 years; land which they have treated better than most conservationists would treat it; land which is their home. That is the real crux of this contro(cid:173)versy. It is not whether there is a dete(cid:173)rioration of park values; it is human values, the values of these peoples' home. Mr. STEIGER of Arizona. Mr. Chair(cid:173)man, I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Chairman and attentive col(cid:173)leagues, I agree with whoever it was-! think the gentleman from Oregon-who said that this matter is going to be de(cid:173)cided mostly by people who have not heard the discussion, but I think the rec(cid:173)ord at least ought to have a few of the bottom-line facts in which I am afraid have been ignored up to now. What we are talking about here is changing title to 459 Indians, title that is now in the National Park Service and National Forest Service, and putting it in trust for this tribe. Now, those Mem(cid:173)bers who are not blessed with very tight connections to the Sierra Club will not understand the sheer horror of this statement. But, they have got to under(cid:173)stand that there are people-and they are unique people-the environmental activists-! have a friend on this side who calls them the \"Green Bigots,\" which I think is patently unfair and I want the record to show that. They are not bigoted just things green, they are bigoted about prac\u00b7tically everything. I would like to make the equation, the impossible position this particular bill puts them in, and one frankly which I really delight in. The great number of these environmental activists are people who have a difficult time spelling \"can(cid:173)yon,\" for example or certainly \"Hava(cid:173)supai,\" but they profess a great love for mankind and certainly great concern for the future. But, here they are, willing to deny 459 impoverished people title land be(cid:173)cause the transfer of the title from one agency to a secretarial trust offends them. So, the human values are aban(cid:173)doned and the crocodile tears are found only for the administrative transfer. I will tell tne Members that there is no magic Forest Service administration and none in the Park Service adminis(cid:173)tration. My friend from Oregon told us there were 40 million acres of forest in jeopardy as a result of these 459 avari(cid:173)cious, land-maddened people. That is not sophistry; that is just baloney. There is no other tribe in the United States that qualifies for this par(cid:173)ticular situation. They have had the use of these lands continuously from a period prior to the time of the granting of the to forest permit, and of course hundreds of years prior to the time of the granting of the award by the Court of Claims. As a matter of fact, if there were a tribe somewhere in this country-and there is not-that had a Forest Service permit and that had only 518 liveable acres to live on, and were starving to death, and we could help them by trans(cid:173)ferring the land to that tribe, I wcmld lead the fight to do that, because I do not see any jeopardy at all in trying to help people with a simple administrative transfer. The fact is, not one single acre is in jeopardy. What is in jeopardy is the prerogatives of the Forest Service, the prerogative of the Park Service. If any(cid:173)body is in jeopardy here, it is the innate greed and innate blind parochial self(cid:173)interest of the departments and bureau(cid:173)crats. I will only tell the Members that if they do not want to give these Indians the land, do not be seduced by the false statements that were made by the Sierra Club people going around today talking about a HUD plan that is really a State plan, that has already been refused by the Indians, by the July 28 resolution. Do not deny them the land because of the false statement of the Sierra Club, because you think they will jeopardize 48 million acres. That is not a fact. If you do not want to give them the land be(cid:173)cause you do not like Indians, that is one thing, and in that instance you would be truthful to your convictions. There is an obsession here that really ought to upset you, but I do not think it does. At any rate, the Sierra Club once again has been proven wrong. Those people who would defend the bureaucratic prerogatives at the expense of human values are really out of reach with the times. Mr. RHODES. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. STEIGER of Arizona. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. RHODES. Would that land be held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior? Mr. STEIGER of Arizona. This land would be held in trust, and the Secretary is mandated in the legislation to approve any plan for any change in the use of the land. Mr. RHODES. So a tramway, or any device like that, would have to be adopted by the Secretary of the Interior. In other words, this is not in the control of the State of Arizona or the tribe itself. The Secretary of the Interior would have the last word and he would be bound by the legislative record that is being made here tonight. I agree with what has been said earlier, I do not want any tramways, or anything unsightly. Mr. DELLENBACK. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. STEIGER of Arizona. I yield the gentleman. Mr. DELLENBACK. The gentleman in the well knows that it is hazardous for almost anyone to trade verbal barbs with him, and I do not intend to get into that particular kind of controversy. While I quite often do not agree with many of the stances taken by many of the people who on occasion lobby us, and while I to ",
            "954": "35248 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE October 10, 1974 with respect to applications (for payment or reconsideration) and requests (for hearings or Appeals Council review) made, and claims approved, on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. COMBATING INFLATION <Mr. ROUSH asked and was given per(cid:173)mission to extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and to include ex(cid:173)traneous matter.) Mr. ROUSH. Mr. Speaker, I am today introducing a concurrent resolution im(cid:173)plementing President Ford's request be(cid:173)fore Congress for a target spending limit to help combat inflation. This concurrent resolution would establish a traget for budget outlays for fiscal 1975 in the amount of $300 bil(cid:173)lion, the amount proposed by the Presi(cid:173)dent. I believe that this is a realistic goal to aim toward since the Congress has already in its completed actions to date reduced the President's estimated budget outlays by $1.5 billion. I believe this resolution is clearly consonant. with the expressed will of the\u00b7 Congress when we passed the Con(cid:173)gressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. That legislation actually provides for a congressionally determined spending target to be voted on a yearly basis. By passing this con(cid:173)current resolution we simply acknowl(cid:173)edge the fact that although the new procedures envisioned by that legisla(cid:173)tion are not effective until 1976, the intent of Congress is to henceforth set budget targets and to try to keep budget outlays within those targets. Asking for the target spending limit President Ford promised that when Congress agreed to set a spending target he would submit a package of budget deferrals and rescissionn to meet this goal that-He would do the tough job of designating for Congressional action . . . those areas which I believe can and must be reduced. These Will be hard choices, but no federal agency, including the Defense Department, Will be untouchable. After the President makes these pro(cid:173)proposals it will then be up to the Con(cid:173)gress to review these budget deferrals and rescission requests, once again in the spirit of the new reform legislation we passed this year. The power of the purse is ours alone in the Congress. That authority carries a heavy responsibility. I have opposed any ceilings or targets for spending which were not initiated by the Con(cid:173)gress and which did not provide for congressional determination of any cuts to be made. If a target is to be set, and it is needed, let us do it for ourselves responsibly. Finally, this concurrent resolution while not a binding agreement, certainly funds could be obligated beyond this proposed target ceiling if necessary, is a restraint and a guideline, a goal toward which we can direct ourselves. Passage of this resolution puts the Congress on record as willing and anxious to reduce the inflationary pressures by Federal spending. ~utting SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM (Mr. MADDEN asked and was given permission to extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and to include ex(cid:173)traneous matter.) Mr. MADDEN. Mr. Speaker, while the Congress seems to be in a reform mood and there are so many stories about the actuarial unsoundness of the social se(cid:173)curity program, we might well cause an in-depth study into the need for reform in the social security system. Many persons, Mr. Speaker, rely on their social security checks, unfortu(cid:173)nately, as their entire retirement income. If the demagogs in our body who for po(cid:173)litical reasons continuously seek to raise the amount of the benefits without pro(cid:173)viding the wherewithal to finance them, the \"trust fund\" could well go bankrupt and create a shambles of the entire system. I am attaching hereto, Mr. Speaker, an editorial opinion which appeared in the August 19 issue o.f Business Insurance, entitled \"Now Let's Reform Social Secu(cid:173)rity.\" This editorial first appeared in the August 12 issue of Pensions and In(cid:173)vestments and I think it should be read by all Members as well as the general public. The editorial follows: Now LET's REFORM SOCIAL SECURITY it has Now that Congress has almost finished its work on reform legislation for the private pension system, we believe it's time it got down to another major problem: reforming the Social Security system. In its new pension reform legislation, the Congress has demanded fiscal responsibility of the private pension system, yet shown little or no such responsibility With the Social Security system. It has greatly in(cid:173)creased the system's benefits, without in(cid:173)creasing the taxes to pay for them. According to one recent estimate, by 1990 the average worker and his employer will each be paying $2,070.45 into the system each year, but the system will be paying out $20 billion more in benefits than it takes in. And even these figures are based on ob(cid:173)solete assumptions, so the picture is probably far worse. According to the Wall Street Jour(cid:173)nal, deficits on the order of $20 billion a year could arrive by 1980. Meanwhile, treasury department figures show that the unfunded liabiltty of the Social Security system is already $2.1 trillion. Will Congress insist that this be funded over 30 years or 40 years as it insists companies fund their pension funds' liabilities? What does Social Security have to do with the private pension system? First, as the extent of the troubles of the system grow, the government could well eye the assets of the private pension system as a source of a much needed transfusion of new assets. Some well informed authorities in the private pension system feel that absorp(cid:173)tion of the private system by Social Security is perhaps less than 10 years away. Second, if action is taken to put the Social Security system back on a sound financial footing, the taxes willt certainly have to rise. This will be an added drain on the corporate treasury. The longer \u00b7this is delayed, the greater will be the drain. At the same time, Social Security benefits will have to be held steady or even cut back, so that the private system's benefits will have to carry the load of keeping pace with in(cid:173)fiatio . There is no doubt that putting Social Secu(cid:173)rity back on a sound financial basis Will hurt the company and the employe through higher contributions. But it is infinitely prefer111ble to absorption of the private system by the government. As we have pointed out in the past, the costs will rise even more if the private sys(cid:173)tem is swallowed up by the Social Security system. Government bureaucracies are no(cid:173)toriously inefil.clent compared with private enterprise, and this will certainly be true in the administration of pension assets. Further, the Social Security system, at least as presently regulated, can't invest in corporate securities, or even treasury bills. It thus misses a chance to grow with the economy, or to earn higher returns. Companies will have no control over in(cid:173)creases in benefits which they now negotiate with their employes. And they will have no say in the timing of the payments into the system. We believe that the pension industry-that is, pension fund trustees, administrators, managers and actuaries--can act to prevent the demise of the private pension system. The industry can first of all publicize the disastrous financial condition of the Social Security system to members of the private pension system, and explain what it means to the average worker. The workers should be told that the Social Security system at present is a giant chain letter which must get more expensive if it is not to break down sometime in the future, since there Will be fewer workers to carry the loa.d. Those who wm still be working in 1990 should be gravely concerned. This warning could be achieved through corporate com(cid:173)munications programs and public relations efforts such as speeches at well-reported con(cid:173)ferences. Further, the industry brought a great deal of pressure to bear in Washington in an effort to influence the shape of the pension reform legislation. A simtlar effort should be mounted to in(cid:173)fluence Congress to take a new look at the Social Security system-from its objectives to its methods and its future. Congress should be exposed to the work of actuaries such as Geoffrey Calvert, a consulting actu(cid:173)ary in British Columbia, Robert Kaplan of Carnegie-Mellon University and Roman Weil of the University of Chicago. These men have exposed the Social Security system and the dangers it is presenting. Getting a member of Congress to vote against a Social Security increase is like ask(cid:173)ing for a vote against motherhood. Many members of Congress seem to think that such a vote would jeopardize their political fu(cid:173)tures. But this can be overcome if the industry can make a sufficient number of workers concerned about the condition of the system and how it could affect them. When the workers realize that if the com(cid:173)pany's private pension plan is absorbed by government system, their benefits at some stage will have to be reduced to a level lower then they now expect, Congress will hear about it. If action is taken immediately to better fund the system, taxes will have to rise by 50 or 75 percent, according to Kaplan and Well. But that much medicine now is better than a lot more later. And it would probably al(cid:173)low a reserve to be bullt up. This reserve could be invested in higher-return invest(cid:173)ments than the flower bonds, and the return might eventually lower costs. We believe reform of the Social Security system is an urgent rna tter deserving the attention and efforts of all who are inter(cid:173)ested in preserving the private pension sys(cid:173)tem. We also belleve that united effort on the par:t of a.ll on lines suggested above wlll be effective 1n influencing Congress to ca.n-y out that reform. Let's not leave it until it is too ",
            "1004": "35298 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE October 11, 197 4, also include the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam. American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands in the allocation of formula grant funds (80 percent of the appropriated grant funds). The current law defines \"States\" for the purpose of allocating formula grant funds as \"the several States of the United States and the District of Columbia.\" As a result, awards to Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa and the Virgin IslandS have come from the 20 percent (discretionary) alloca\u00b7 tion of grant funds. The net effect has been to limit the opportunity to fund additional worthy State and local government projects that may have had a substantial impact on improved personnel administration. In addition, we will need to provide for grants to Indian tribes and the Trust Territory of the Pacifl.c Islands from the 20 percent alloca\u00b7 tion of discretionary grant funds should they become eligible recipients under the IPA as we have proposed. Financially, the proposed bill would pro(cid:173)vide, for the first time, full coverage under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act to In(cid:173)dian tribes and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. These governmental entities would have the opportunity to obtain bene(cid:173)fits which are now only available to State and local governments and the territories and possessions of the United States. These bene(cid:173)fits include: grants-in-aid to strenghten per(cid:173)sonnel management systems and to train employes; direct participation in Federal training programs; comprehensive technical assistance to strengthen personnel systems; and participation in intergovernmental mo(cid:173)bility assignments. IPA assistance could be used by Indian tribes and the Trust Territory to improve their ab111ty to plan and manage programs for economic, educational and social devel(cid:173)opment. The Office of Management and Budget advises that there would be no objection from the standpoint of the Administration's program to the submission of this proposal. A similar letter is being sent to the Speak(cid:173)er of the House. By Direction of the Commission: Sincerely yours, ROBERT E. HAMPTON, Chairman. By Mr. HUMPHREY: s. 4136. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to provide tax relief to low-and middle-income tax(cid:173)payers and to increase revenues from other tax sources. Referred to the Com(cid:173)mittee on Finance. <Mr. HUMPHREY'S remarks on the in(cid:173)troduction of the Tax Equity Act of 1974 are printed later in today's REcoRD.) By Mr. HANSEN: S. 4137. A bill to amend part B of title XI of the Social Security Act, Profes(cid:173)sional Standards Review, to provide for the review of dental services by dentists. Referred to the Committee on Finance. Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, the American Dental Association have a rightful interest in the Professional Standards Review Organizations proce(cid:173)dures under terms of the Social Security Act. Because of that interest and concern, I am introducing legislation today ad(cid:173)dressed to that problem. Representatives of the American Den(cid:173)tal Association testified before the Sen(cid:173)ate Finance Committee that while the law establishing Professional Standards Review Organizations applies to \"health care services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part\" under the Social Security Act, it excludes members of the dental profession from any mean(cid:173)ingful participation in the program. The concern of the association is ser(cid:173)ious and substantive since a significant number of its members are providing several hundreds of millions of dollars in dental services under title V, XIX, and XVIII. With respect to institutional services, inpatient hospital admissions for dental care are well over a million per year. Additionally, as my colleagues know, the law contemplates and permits ex(cid:173)pansion of PSROs to ambulatory services which eventually will involve all of the Nation's 100,000 practicing dentists in the PSRO program. The direct effect upon the dental pro(cid:173)fession would increase manifold if any of the major pending national health insurance bills should be enacted since all of them have a tie-in with the PSRO provisions of title XI. It does not seem reasonable or sensible that the dental profession should be subjected to this highly complicated and exacting \"peer\" review system without having any representation in its devel(cid:173)opment, operation, and adjudicatory functions. The report of the Senate Finance Committee on the original PSRO bill clearly indicates an intent that only dentists should review the work of den(cid:173)tists, but unfortunately this was not carried over into the language of the law. In order to remedy this problem, the ADA has proposed a suggested amend(cid:173)ment which would provide: First, that in order to be approved a PSRO would be required to have a formal arrange(cid:173)ment with dentists in a given area that is coextensive in all respects with the requirements relating to medical serv(cid:173)ices; second, that dentists be appointed to the statewide councils and the nation(cid:173)al council; and third, that dentists be in(cid:173)cluded in the limitation of liability sec(cid:173)tion of the law. Mr. President, I am introducing the proposed amendment because it is essen(cid:173)tialif dentists are to be required to meet the requirements of the law. The American Dental Association's 115th annual session will be held here in Washington during the week of Novem(cid:173)ber 10-13, at which more than 20,000 dentists and their families will be in attendance. I am pleased to introduced this pro(cid:173)posed amendment to PSRO language to provide for the review of dental services by dentists and I urge its timely consideration.

A b111 to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to extend the time for the submission of certain studies and recommendations to the Congress. Re(cid:173)ferred to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. Mr. BEALL. Mr. President, I am send(cid:173)ing to the desk legislation that would amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to extend the time for the submission of certain studies and recommendations of the Federal Council on the Aging to the Congress. In Public Law 93-29 which was signed into law on May 3, 1973, the 15 member Federal Council on the Aging was estab(cid:173)lished to advise the President, the Con(cid:173)gress, the Secretary of Health, Educa(cid:173)tion, and Welfare, and the Commissioner on Aging on matters relating to or af(cid:173)fecting the well-being of our Nation's senior citizens. In addition to its general oversight responsibilities, the Federal Council on the Aging was mandated by the law to conduct a series of special studies which are to be submitted to the President and/or Congress within a specific time span. Two of these studies were to be com(cid:173)pleted \"no later than 18 months after enactment of this act.\" However, the nominees for the Federal Council on the Aging were not submitted to the Sen(cid:173)ate until March 27, 1974. Senate con(cid:173)firmation occurred on June 5 and the Council members were sworn in on June 25. The first meeting of the Coun(cid:173)cil occurred in August and they have been confronted by a number of matters that have required their immediate at(cid:173)tention. Thus it will not be possible for them to complete the studies on the in(cid:173)terrelationship of benefit programs for the elderly and the impact of taxes on the elderly by November 3, 1974. Mr. President, the legislation I am sending to the desk would amend sec(cid:173)tion 205 (g) and 205 (h) to extend the due date for these reports from Novem(cid:173)ber 3, 1974, to December 1, 1975. Mr. President, I am delighted to be joined in cosponsoring this legislation by my distinguished colleagues Senators BIBLE, BROCK, BROOKE, DOMENICI, DOMI\u2022 NICK, EAGLETON, FONG, HANSEN, JAVITS, Moss, PERCY, SCHWEIKER, TAFT, and WILLIAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con(cid:173)sent that section 205(g) and section 205 (h) of Public Law 93-29, the text of S. 4138, and the letter from Secretary Weinberger transmitting this proposed legislation to the Congress be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my re(cid:173)marks. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in .the RECORD, as follows: \"(g) The Council shall undertake a study of the interrelationships of benefit programs for the elderly operated by Federal, State, and local government agencies. Following the completion or this study, but no later than eighteen months after enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to Congress recommendations for bringing about greater uniformity o! ellgib1Uty standards, and for el1mlnat1ng the negative impact that one program's standards may have on another. \"(h) The Council shall undertake a study of the combined impact of all taxes on the elderly-including but not limited to income, property, sales, social security taxes.

Mr. President, on Oc(cid:173)tober the American University hosted a symposium on world food and population, entitled \"To Nourish Hu(cid:173)manity.\" Under the directi\u00b7On of Dr. Darrell Randall, director, International Administration for World Human Needs, the American University, and cochaired by Dr. Howard R. Cottam, visiting pro(cid:173)fessor, the American University, 60 ex(cid:173)perts and concerned individuals gath(cid:173)ered to give their views on the world food crisis and what they hoped would be ac(cid:173)complished at the World Food Confer(cid:173)ence in Rome, November 5-16. These opinions represented a variety of back(cid:173)ground and expertise. Today we are faced with food short(cid:173)ages and an increasing number of people who are malnourished or starving. Each week the world must feed 1.4 million more people. And each week the cost of increasing worldwide agricultural pro(cid:173)duction becomes greater and the re(cid:173)sources needed to do this become more scarce. In an increasingly interdepend(cid:173)ent world, international solutions must be developed to deal with these problems. The World Food Conference provides an opportunity to do this. The American University has per(cid:173)formed a great public service in focusing attention on this problem and thereby better informing all of us. I commend the summary proceedings to my col(cid:173)leagues. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the REc(cid:173)ORD. There being no objection, the sum(cid:173)mary proceedings were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: To NOURISH !iUMANrrY (Summary proceedings of a Symposium on World Food and Population, the American University Campus, Oct. 7-8, 1974) INTRODUCTION With increasing clarity there 1s a global focus on the modalities of nourishing hu(cid:173)manity. The theme and format of this sym(cid:173)posi urn \"To Nourish Human! ty\" reflects the purpose and the agenda of the forthcoming World Food Conference: To increase food production where there are scarcities, to im(cid:173)prove nutrition of the neediest and to pro(cid:173)vide food security for everyone. The Plan of Action of the recent World Population Conference emphasized nutrition and de(cid:173)velopment. The crux of the world food problem is lim(cid:173)ited resources unevenly accessible to a bur(cid:173)geoning population in a world divided by jealously guarded sovereign rights and boundaries. Notwithstanding decades of con(cid:173)certed effort there are more malnourished people than ever before, nearly a ha.lf-blllion by conservative criteria. Something is out of focus. Governments will debate and decide on appropriate action in 'November on the basis of an agreed assessment of the world food situation. Americar. University arranged this Symposium to a.nalyze the U.S. role \"To Nourish Humanity.\" Sixty concerned and in(cid:173)formed professionals presented addresses in four plenary sessions, ten panels and one technical presentation. More than 500 indi(cid:173)viduals registered for the Symposium and many participated actively in discussion and debate. In a welcoming address to the Symposium participants, Dean Morris W. H. Collins, Jr., of the College of Public Affairs of The Ameri(cid:173)can University, declared that a modern uni(cid:173)versity can not sit idly by while millions o1 persons starve. \"A university, with all its vi(cid:173)tality and resources,\" he says, \"has much to contribute toward answers to world prob(cid:173)lems. We intend to work with others in the intellectual field with technical assistance ... Our School is called a School of Inter(cid:173)national Service and we make no apologies for that name. A university in a modern so(cid:173)ciety has a service role to play.\" In order that the Symposium presenta(cid:173)tions-and reaction inspired among other Symposium participants-might be widely shared before the World Food Conference next month, this summary of proceedings has been compiled by a group of experienced rapporteurs and quickly, if modestly, reproduced. As would be the case in any such selective process, one might argue the validity of some Symposium themes identified as highlights here. Our purpose, however, was not to pro(cid:173)duce a definitive record of proceedings but to carry one step further, now, the process of debate and dialogue so vital to formulating U.S. policy responsive to the global chal(cid:173)lenge of nourishing humanity.

            "1104": "35398 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE October 11, 1974 STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY SEc. 2. (a) The Congress, recognizing the profound impact of science and technology on society, and the interrelations of scien(cid:173)tific, technological, economic, social, political, and institutional factors, hereby finds that--( 1) Federal funding for science and tech(cid:173)nology represents an investment in the fu(cid:173)ture, which is indispensable to sustained na(cid:173)tional progress; (2) the manpower pool of scientists and engineers constitutes an invaluable national resource which should be utilized to the maximum extent possible at all times; (3) the scientific and technological ca(cid:173)pabilities within the United States, if prop(cid:173)erly applied and directed, could effectively assist in improving the quality of life and in anticipating and resolving many critical and emerging national problems; (4) strong participation by State and local governments is essential to the successful solution of many civilian problems, and in developing programs for the application of science and technology to civilian needs and to setting civilian research and development activities priorities; (5) the maintenance and strengthening of diversified scientific and technological ca(cid:173)pabilities in government, industry and the universities, and the encouragement of in(cid:173)dependent initiatives based on such capabil(cid:173)ities, are essential to the most effective use of science and technology in resolving critical and emerging national problems; ( 6) a more systematic approach is needed to identify critical and emerging national problems and to analyze, plan, and coordinate Federal science and technology programs, policies, and activities intended to contrib(cid:173)ute to the resolution of such problems; and (7) the effectiveness of scientific and tech(cid:173)nological contributions to improvements in the quality of life and the resolution of crit(cid:173)ical and emerging national problems depends on the maintenance of a strong base of knowledge in science and advanced tech(cid:173)nology together with a resource of highly qualified scientists and engineers. (b) The Congress declares that it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal Government to take appropriate measures directed toward achieving the fol(cid:173)lowing goals-( 1) there must be a continuing Federal investment in science and technology ade(cid:173)quate to the needs of the Nation; (2) the level of this investment must be adjusted annually with regard to particular needs and opportunities and the prevalent economic situation; (3) the Federal investment in science and technology must be allocated annually among the priority needs of the Nation, including the need to maintain the Nation's strength in basic research and education in science and engineering; (4) scientists, engineers, and technicians must have continuing opportunities for so(cid:173)cially useful employment in positions com(cid:173)mensurate with their professional, technical capabilities; and (5) the National capab111ties for techno(cid:173)logical planning and policy formulation must be strengthened. (c) Therefore, it is declared to be the pur(cid:173)pose of this Act to promote the effective application of science and technology to the furtherance of national goals by-(1) establishing a Council of Advisers on Science and Technology in the Executive Office of the President to provide a source of scientific ad technological analysis and judg(cid:173)ment to the President; ( 2) establishing an Intergovernmental Science and Technology Advisory Committee to foster the application of science ann. tech(cid:173)nology to State and regional needs; (3) establishing an Interagency Federal Coordinating Committee on Science and 'l\u00b7echnology to coordinate agency research and development efforts; and (4) having the President submit an annual Science and Technology Report to the Congress. TITLE I-COUNCIL OF ADVISERS ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ESTABLISHMENT OF COUNCIL SEc. 101. (a) There is established in the Executive Office of the President a Council of Advisers on Science and Technology (here(cid:173)inafter referred to as the \"Council\"). The Council shall be composed of three Members who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate from among individuals who, by rea(cid:173)son of their training, experience, and attain(cid:173)ments, are exceptionally qualified to analyze and interpret scientific and technological developments; to appraise and recommend programs, policies, and activities of the Fed(cid:173)eral Government in the light of the policy declared in section 2; and are sensitive to the economic, social, esthetic, and cultural needs and interests of the Nation. (b) The President shall dseignate one of the members of the Council as Chairman and one as Vice Chairman, who shall act as Chairman in the absence of the Chairman. (c) Members of the Council shall serve full time and the Chairman of the Council shall be compensated at the rate provided for level II of the Executive Schedule (5 U.S.C. 5313). The other members of the Council shall be compensated at the rate provided for level IV of the Executive Schedule (5 u.s.c. 5315). (d) The Council may employ such officers and employees as may be necessary to carry out its functions under this Act.

Following that, we will take upS. 3838, debt obligations confer(cid:173)ence report. There may be one or two other items to be called up by unanimous consent.

Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, how long is it planned to go today? How much longer today? Mr. O'NEILL. Until the legislation I just mentioned has been finished. There are these Ways and Means conference reports, and I understand from the act(cid:173)ing chairman that they are noncontro(cid:173)versial. When we get through with those, we will take up S. 3838, which is debt obligations. If there are any unanimous-consent requests or something of that nature, there is a possibility that they may be brought up. Then we will have 1-minute ",

            "1254": "35548 50 per cent over the last school year. We all know how little a 1974 dollar will buy. Inflation is eating away at our school budgets. One study shows that from 1969 to 1974: \u00b7 There has been a serious erosion of goods and services available through Federnl fund(cid:173)ing for elementary and secondary education programs. Despite the increases by this Congress, inflation is corroding our school pro(cid:173)grams. Spending is not keeping pace with rising costs. So on the one hand, we are saying that we recognize these new and broader needs; we recognize the need to replenish and upgrade our existing programs. But, by underfunding education, we are say(cid:173)ing, we only care so much. There is another reason why I make my plea today for adequate funding for education. The education picture has changed. Enrollments are steadily drop(cid:173)ping, especially on our elementary and secondary schools. USOE says that in 1975, K-12 enrollment will be 49.2 mil(cid:173)lion, down from 49.7 in 1974 and 51.3 in 1970. In 1980, elementary and secondary enrollment is expected to be 45.7 million. We have an abundance of teachers which means that those we hire are the best. Additionally, when teachers have fewer students and more time to teach, they are better teachers. Instruction is in(cid:173)creasingly becoming more innovative, more individualized, more tuned to the individual needs of every student. Now, with the slowdown in enrollment and the excess of teachers, we have an excellent opportunity to provide better education. Teachers are by their nature imaginative and energetic. They have many inner resources. But they cannot \"fight it alone.\" They must have the help that only the Federal Government can pro(cid:173)vide. They must have the funds to back up their ideas. . I particularly want to address several programs that I believe to be important to our teachers. ESEA TITLE I This program, which provides funds to schools for programs for educationally and economically deprived children, reached 6 million children in 13,900 of our roughly 16,000 school districts last year. Under the new formula, some ex(cid:173)perts say we will only reach 70 percent of the eligible schoolchildren. Thus, with(cid:173)o~t inflation, an appropriation of $1.9 billion would probably not meet our needs. ESEA II AND NDEA In Instructional materials and equipment are the backbones of instruction. These two programs provide basic tools for learning in classrooms, libraries, media centers, guidance centers, and learning resource centers. A recent U.S. Offi.ce of Education study concluded: The need for larger quantities of equip(cid:173)ment and xnaterials in schools appears to be almost universal. The American Library Association re(cid:173)ports that in 14 States, including some of the largest and most populous, more than half the elementary schools still lack libraries. And the National Audio-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS Visual Association reports that the cost of raw materials for A-V products and the cost of paper for printed products has climbed steeply this year for many reasons including the soaring rise in the cost of oil, petrochemicals, plastics and transportation. ' A recent survey of all States, con(cid:173)ducted by the North Carolina Depart(cid:173)ment of Public Instruction, reveals that local schools need $125 million for NDEA III and $160 million for ESEA II in fiscal year 1975. Contrast these real needs with the sums in H.R. 16900: [In millions) Fiscal Fiscal year 1975 year----------1974, Bud-H.R. Roybal(cid:173)actual get 16900 Needed veysey ESEA II_ ___ _ NDEA Ill_ __ _ 90.2 28.5 90.2 28.5 90.2 15.0 160.1 125.6 +5 +O -----------------It is easy to see that H.R. 16900 takes us no closer to the needs of our local schools, and the Roybal-Veysey amend-ment makes only a very slight improve-ment in the right direction. In Michigan during fiscal year 1974, our schools received a total of $1,260,000 for NDEA III. However, the State re-ceived requests from local school districts throughout the State of $5,511,784 for NDEA III funding. In response to this clear need in my State, H.R. 16900 would provide Michigan with only $663,340-enough to SUpply Only 12 percent Of the amount applied for. H.R. 16900 is saying \"no\" to the 88 percent which will have to be turned down. BILINGUAL AND HANDICAPPED In recent years the courts have told us that we must provide full educational opportunities to all students including bilingual and handicapped ~hildren. I \":'ould hope that we could act out of prin(cid:173)Ciple, not be pushed into it by a court order. Finally, in 1974, we must show wUh our dollars that we will not neglect our handicapped and bilingual students. No .longer must we let these students dron out of school because school is not for them. No longer must we put them in classes totally unsuited for their needs. No longer can we leave them out of the educa~~on picture. The cost of educating our bilmgual and handicapped students could well run into the billions. But good education programs for these, \"the for(cid:173)gotten,\" is probably even a better invest(cid:173)m~nt than other education expenditures. Given the chance, the students can be(cid:173)come self-sufficient, productive members of society. Giving our schools the money they need is not only a humanitarian act but an economic one. ADULT EDUCATION Studies presented to Congress show that 57 million adults over age 16 have not completed high school and are not \u00b7 enrolled in school. We must give them an opportunity, and again it is cost-effective. The gains they make in educational achievement, earning power and tax rev(cid:173)enue return to the Federal Government are compelling arguments for providing sumcient funds for this program. October 11, 1974 IMPACT AID The administration has proposed that $340.3 million be appropriated for this program. Despite frequent criticism of the program's failings, I believe it essen(cid:173)tial and sound and I have said so re(cid:173)peatedly. It affects more than school districts. The Federal Gov~rn\u00adment owns more than one-third of the land area of the United States and over 50 percent in five States. If we cut im(cid:173)pact aid, we are asking localities to bear the burden their Government has im(cid:173)posed on them. We are giving local gov-ernments the go-ahead to raise local property taxes. This I cannot buy. 4 000 ESEA m This program has been a shining example of what the Federal Govern(cid:173)ment can do. It has stimulated school systems to establish and conduct inno(cid:173)vative instructional programs. It has helped create career guidance and coun-seling programs. It has encouraged teachers and administrators to develop novel and model ways of finding solu(cid:173)tions to our educational problems. Many say it is a m~el of Federal, State, and local cooperation for the improvement of school curricula. We cannot afford curtail or call to a halt these advances Administration recommends we continu~ at last year's levels. The committee has cut the program by $21 million. Such a cut is in direct contradiction to the goals of Federal support for innovation. to FEW MORE DOLLARS FOR OUR CHILDREN Mr. Speaker, for 6 years, we have seen education shunted about in the Federal bureau~racy. For 6 years, we have seen educatiOn given the back Seat. For 6 years, we have seen Federal dollars for education withheld, impounded and re(cid:173)jected. For 6 years, we have seen our schoolchildren suffering. I submit that this year we must make a new start. We must say to our schools that we care. And I submit that, in a bill in which we are giving thousands of our hard-earned tax dollars to an unindicted co-conspira(cid:173)tor who abused democracy more than any President known in American his(cid:173)tory, we can spare a few more dollars for our children. PRODUCTION AND PRODUCERS ARE THE ANSWER TO INFLATION(cid:173)RIDDEN COUNTRY HON. BILL ALEXANDER OF ARKANSAS IN THE HOUS:J;l; OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, October 10, 1974 Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. Speaker, in the last few weeks, I have talked myself blue in the face in an effort to counteract the powerful interest groups who oppose the expansion of rice production in this coun(cid:173)try. These people do not seem to be con(cid:173)cerned with feeding a hungry world or a hungry America. At this point, I would like to share with my colleagues a letter from one of my constituents which perhaps states the point better than I ever can: ",
            "1304": "35598 EXTENSIONS OF R\u00a3MARKS October 11, 1974 By adopting the so-called Hansen plan, instead of the original Boiling-Martin committee reform bill, the House has once again ducked the issue of true com(cid:173)mittee reform. With a couple of excep(cid:173)tions, the changes are cosmetic-an elec(cid:173)tion year gesture to make our constitu(cid:173)ents think Congress is reforming itself. Frankly, the Boiling-Martin proposal itself fell far short of the kind of major overhaul the House needs. Even this plan did nothing about non-germane amend(cid:173)ments, conflict-of-interest voting, curb(cid:173)ing the powers of conference committees, or the elimination of the idiotic schedul(cid:173)ing procedures that the House struggles under. But the Boiling-Martin report did make a start toward meaningful reorga(cid:173)nization of the committee structure along logical jurisdictional boundaries. It would have consolidated energy juris(cid:173)diction now scattered among at least 94 committees and subcommittees of the two Houses. The Boiling-Martin plan limited Members to a single committee assignment; it split Education and Labor, abolished the Post Office Committee, and made other similar changes. About the only worthwhile part of this so-called reform package which survived in the Hansen substitute is the require ment to give the minority party adequate staffing and elimination of proxy voting. Unfortunately, there's no assurrance even these modest reforms will be im(cid:173)plemented when Congress reconvenes in 1975. I recall that the 1970 Legislative Reor(cid:173)ganization Act provided for minority staffing. But when the new Congress con(cid:173)vened the following year the Democrats simply went into caucus and changed the decision back to the old way. . . _ ex(cid:173)actly the same kind of high-handed tac(cid:173)tics that resulted in the adoption of the Hansen substitute. I hope the people of this country are watching closely the action of the House on this matter. After a lot of grumbling and complaining by the general public, the House sent out a bipartisan commit(cid:173)tee, under the leadership of two of our most distinguished Members, DICK BoLL(cid:173)ING and DAVE MARTIN, to conduct a year(cid:173)long study that cost a million dollars. A thoughtful and carefully worked-out plan for committee reorganization re(cid:173)sulted. But when the committee reported its findings, the Democrats went into cau(cid:173)cus. Behind closed doors and by a secret vote, they killed the Boiling-Martin plan and instead set up the so-called Hansen committee-not a committee of the House, but a committee of the Demo(cid:173)cratic Caucus, to write a watered-down version. Adopting this plan this week, the House has reverted to the worst traditions o:t the past and turned its back again on the need for meaningful congressional reform. What a \"copout.\" SPENDING PROGRAMS HON. ELWOOD HILLIS OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, October 11, 1974 Mr. HILLIS. Mr. Speaker, at a time when the Federal Government needs to seriously review its spending programs, I would like to share with my colleagues the following editorial which appeared in the Anderson Herald: STOP FOREIGN AID When anyone advocates elimination of foreign aid, the cries and howls of liberals can be heard from coast to coast. Rarely, if ever, do they comNorth with any facts or figures justifying our foreign give(cid:173)aways. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently issued a report that should be dis(cid:173)heartening to every American. The commit(cid:173)tee has recommended an authorization 0'! $2.5 b1llion for certain economic, military assistance and credit sales programs. That amount is only part of $8.5 billion in total foreign aid proposed for the current fiscal year. Americans have grown numb to such figures over the years. When individual items in the proposal are studied, however, they could prompt a few hard questions. One proposal calls for $15 milllon in Amer(cid:173)ican tax dollars for outright m111tary assist(cid:173)ance to African nations. What value do we receive from $11.3 million in military aid to Ethiopia, or $70,000 to Ghana, or $100,-000 in arms to Liberia? How in the name of common sense can we justify $50,000 to Mall, $860,000 to Morocco, or $300,000 to Zaire. The $300,000 to Zaire is equivalent to the total income tax paid by 200 middle-income fami(cid:173)lies. In piecemeal fashion the American tax(cid:173)payers have become saddled with providing an annual allowance for more than 100 countries. It has been proposed that taxpay(cid:173)ers provide in economic or mmtary aid this year, $2.2 million to Upper Volta, $17.2 mil(cid:173)lion to Afghanistan, $7 million to Nepal, and $232 million to Turkey. If that isn't enough to dampen anyone's spirits, through the Peace Corps we will spend $66,000 in Fiji, $452,000 to Swazi(cid:173)land, and $181,000 in Oman. How did this lunacy get started? Federal aid simply got to be a habit, according to the committee, and it has now become a \"near-addictive habit.\" \"At present,\" the committee observes, \"the far-flung network of U.S. military assistance, advisory groups, military missions, and mili(cid:173)tary groups gives bureaucratic momentum to the perpetuation of an, extensive program the rationale for which each year has be(cid:173)come increasingly dubious. Through this bureaucracy, the U.S. continues-almost habitually-to dispense hundreds of milllons of dollars of weapons in pursuit of such vaguely defined goals as 'stability,' 'balance, \u2022 and the 'maintenance of friendly relations.' Yet in the committee's view, there is little evidence that such general purposes have ac(cid:173)tually been served by this massive and often indiscriminate program.'' On the contrary, milltary aid, the commit(cid:173)tee concludes, \"not only escalates the de(cid:173)structive potential of international conflict but also enhances the relative power of the military within those societies and thereby creates undesirable tendencies away from the democratic processes which the programs in its origins, was intended to defeat.\" It seems that what the committee is say(cid:173)ing in all that fancy language is nothing more than that we are pouring our money down the drain in more than 100 countries because Congress does not have the guts to stop the bureaucracies, set its collective foot down and deny the money to \"enhance the relative power of the mllitary within those societies.'' Regardless of how sorry we might feel for some of the other nations of the world, it is pure stupidity for the United States to bankrupt itself, or weaken itself to the point it can be destroyed by others, for the sake of being the \"good guy\" by giving away our money, military equipment and resources. After all, welfare should begin at home and the American taxpayers are in dire circum(cid:173)stances. The committee did recommend a three(cid:173)year phase-out of general military aid. Now is the time for every taxpayer in the country to let the congressmen and senators know that foreign aid must be stopped-and stopped now-if our nation is to survive. If the committee's recommendation sticks, American taxpayers could get a break in time. Until such a recommendation passes the Con(cid:173)gress, however, the drain continues. S. 3838, THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND USURY CEILING LEGISLATION HON. JOHN H. ROUSSELOT OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, October 11, 1974 Mr. ROUSSELOT. Mr. Speaker, I sup(cid:173)port the conference report on S. 3838, the debt obligations and usury ceiling legis(cid:173)lation. I believe this legislation is a fair com(cid:173)promise in resolving the differences be(cid:173)tween the House-and Senate-passed versions of this legislation. Title I of the bill is substantially the same as the legislation which passed the House relating to the regulation of the issuing and sale of variable rate notes. Title II and title III of the conference report were incorporated in the Senate(cid:173)passed version and were accepted by the House conferees only after careful con(cid:173)sideration. Both of these provisions are intended to correct situations in specific States, and they are both of a temporary nature-expire July 1, 1977, or sooner if action is taken at the State level to over(cid:173)ride these exemptions. As one who has repeatedly stood before this body and argued for States' rights, I can assure you that I would not be supporting these provisions if I thought they in any way preempted State controls that could be quickly corrected at the State level if that State so desired. I am convinced that the States involved do want this im(cid:173)mediate relief, and only in order to give them time to correct it themselves through the State process. TITLE n-INTEREST RATE AMENDMENTS REGARD(cid:173)ING STATE USURY CEILINGS ON BUSINESS LOANS In today's money market, insured banks and savings and loan associations in Tennessee, Arkansas, and Montana are virtually unable to make business and commercial loans because of State statu(cid:173)tory and constitutional restraints which ",
            "1354": "35648 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE October 15, 1974 ago by Christopher Columbus with a gi(cid:173)gantic parade on our great street-State Street. Over 750,000 people viewed the parade which was televised over WGN for 1% hours. Our esteemed colleague, the distin(cid:173)guished chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Hon. PETER W. RODINO, JR., was guest Of honor at the great event. Each year, Chicago celebrates Colum(cid:173)bus Day with a series of specially planned events culminating in the spectacular parade on State Street. The theme for this year's parade was \"Italian Contri(cid:173)butions to Medicine.\" The parade not only honored Christopher Columbus as father of all immigrants, but it also em(cid:173)phasized the spirit of achievement and com'Qined efforts of all ethnic groups which have made our city and Nation great. The voyage of Christopher Columbus marked one of history's most challenging and rewarding explorations. He opened this continent to the migration of settlers who created an enduring nation and the United States of America still carries forth his spirit of exploration as part of its national heritage. Americans of the 20th century strive to follow the vision and unshakeable faith of Christopher Columbus by seek(cid:173)ing to discover a \"New World\" of peace and cooperation. Monday's Columbus Day celebration began with a Concelebrated Mass at Our Lady of Pompeii Church at 9 a.m., Aux(cid:173)iliary Bishop Alfred L. Abramowicz, D.D. presided; and the concelebrants included Rev. Msgr. Edward Pellicore; Rev. Paul J. Asciolla, C.S.; Rev. Angelo Calandra, C.S.; Rev. Lawrence Cozzi, C.S.; Rev. August Fecci, C.S.; Rev. Angelo Garbin; Rev. Leonard H. Mattei; and the homily was given by Rev. Gino Dalpiaz. Special wreath-laying ceremonies took place at 11 a.m. at the Columbus Statue in Vernon Park, and at 3 p.m., following the parade, the Order of Sons of Italy in America laid a wreath at the Colum(cid:173)bus Statue in Grant Park. The main event of our celebration, Chicago's great Columbus Day Parade, began at 1 p.m. on State Street and some 60 floats depicting the theme of the parade along with 80 marching units participated. Authentic native costumes of Italy were worn by women and child(cid:173)ren in the parade, in addition to the vari(cid:173)ous school bands, corps of marchers, and drum and bugle corps which also par(cid:173)ticipated. Christopher Columbus, the father of all immigrants, was portrayed by Joe Livingston, 1121 North Karlov, in Chicago. Chairman PETER RODINO, as the guest of honor, along with Hon. Richard J. Daley, mayor of Chicago; Hon. Dan Walker, Governor of nlinois; Rudolph Leone, parade grand marshal; Pasquale M. DeMarco, the parade's 1974 general chairman\u00b7 Anthony J. Fornelli, honorary parade co-chairman; Dr. ,Alvaro V. Bel(cid:173)tran!, Chicago's consul general of Italy; and many other political dignitaries, civic leaders, members of the judiciary, businessmen from the community, and labor leaders kicked off the parade. Each year the Joint Civic Committee of Italian Americans, comprised of more than 40 Italo-American civic organiza(cid:173)tions in the Chicagoland area, sponsors the Columbus Day parade and other re(cid:173)lated activities. Many local groups co(cid:173)operate with the Joint Civic Committee in this communitywide tribute to Colum(cid:173)bus, and both Anthony Sorrentino, con(cid:173)sultant, and Dr. Frank Pellegrini, execu(cid:173)tive director of the Joint Civic Commit(cid:173)tee of Italian Americans, have helped to coordinate the various activities for many years. One of the highlights of Chicago's Columbus Day celebration is the selec(cid:173)tion of the queen of the parade. This year, Mary Jane De Rosa, 2817 North Moody, of Chicago, was chosen to reign as queen of the Columbus Day parade. Judged on her beauty, poise, and per(cid:173)sonality, Mary Jane De Rosa, as winner of the Columbus Day Queen Contest, won a round trip to Italy from Alitalia Airlines, a round trip to Las Vegas, a trophy, a bouquet of roses, and $100 from D:~;. DeMarco, the parade's general chair(cid:173)man. She will also make TV appearances on the \"Louis Farina Show\" and the \"Mary Jane Hayes Program\" in Chicago. The members of the queen's court were Kathleen A. Ingallinera, 3452 North Not(cid:173)tingham, Chicago; Tina Spitzzeri, 845 North St. Louis, Chicago; Diane Lizzio, 5940 South Kolmar, Chicago; and Cara Mia Cipolla, 3220 Techny Road, North(cid:173)brook, Ill. Judges for the final Columbus Day Queen Contest were Fred Mazzei, chair(cid:173)man; Hon. Philip Romiti, judge of Cook County Circuit Court; Hon. John D'Arco, Jr., Illinois State representative; Mr. Steve Fiorentino, assistant to the vice president of Banco di Roma; Miss Adri(cid:173)enne Levatino, research analyst; Mrs. Theresa Petrone; Mr. Carmen Fanzone, player for the Chicago Cubs; and Mr. Don Case, president of D.A.C. Enter(cid:173)prises. A \"Festa del Moda\" was held this year on October 6. This is a fashion show held annually in conjunction with Columbus Day festivities. More than 150 persons participated in the show and wore tradi(cid:173)tional handmade costumes representing the culture native to various areas of the Italian peninsula. Dr. Mary Ellen Bat(cid:173)inich, chairman, and her authentic Ital(cid:173)ian costumes subcommittee can be proud of their contribution to the success and beauty of our Columbus Day pageantry. Lawrence Spallitta and the float person(cid:173)nel subcommittee members can also be proud of their outstanding contribution to the parade.

            "1404": "35698 log.ical effec\u00b7t, the spreading among the popu\u00b7 lation at large of that disregard of long(cid:173)-range views and exclusive concern with im(cid:173)mediate advantages which already dominate public policy. It is no accident that inflationary policies .are generally advocated by those who want more government control-though, unfortu(cid:173)nately, not by them alone. The increased dependence of the ind\u2022ividual upon govern(cid:173)ment which infiation produces and the de(cid:173)mand for more government action to which this leads may for the socialist be an argu(cid:173)ment in its favor. Those who wish to pre(cid:173)serve freedom should recognize, however, that inflation is probably the most important single factor in that v-icious circle wherein one kind of government action makes more and more government control necessary. FaT this reason, all those who wish to stop the drift toward increasing government control should concentrate their efforts on monetary policy. There is perhaps nothing more dis(cid:173)heartening than the fac\u00b7t that there are st111 so many inte111gent and informed people who in most other respects wm defend freedom and yet are induced by the immediate bene(cid:173)fl. ts of an expansionist policy to support what, in the long run, must destroy the foundations of a free socriety. WHILE GOVERNMENT FOOD STATIS(cid:173)TICS RISE, YOUR FOOD PRICES SKYROCKET HON. WAYNE OWENS OF UTAH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, October 15, 1974 Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, our Ameri(cid:173)can republic has :~aced national emer(cid:173)gencies before. War, natural catas(cid:173)trophes, and economic upheavals are not strangers to the American people. To them the spirit of sacrifice is not new. When necessary, when pressed upon by nature, they are enobled by. their willingness to sacrifice. But today, we face a grave trial. Be(cid:173)fore us we see the horrible specter of inflation grown rampant. Allowing in(cid:173)flation is a tax without legislation, a tax without representation, an oppression to the poor. It cannot be allowed to exist unaddressed. Our situation is made more grave, unlike other times of emergency, because we also face a crisis of spirit. In 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt came before this body in times no less vexa(cid:173)tious and declared that we have ''noth(cid:173)ing to fear but fear itself.\" I believe those words. We need that kind of lead(cid:173)ership today. It is a quality of leadership to call for sacrifice, but the responsibility of Gov(cid:173)ernment is to insure that it is fairly dis(cid:173)tributed, that all will share the burden. It is to this leadership the people turn for resolution so that economic crisis does not become a .crisis of the spirit, a sacrifice of the many for the few. The time for experimentation is passed. There is no more time to trifle with the expectations and confidences of the American people. They can, and they must be told that the remedy is not easy, the causes are not singular, the recov(cid:173)ery process not without sacrifice. They must also be told what the process is, and why the end is not in doubt. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS It makes little sense to ask the con(cid:173)sumer for less consumption when the market already makes no exception for its limitations of their demands. The American consumer buys fewer cars, and the price goes up, he turns down his thermostat, and he pays more to make up for what he did not use. He buyes fewer clothes, gives up his vacation, and drives less, but prices continue to go up. My purpose today is not to discuss the whole problem, but to focus upon the most fundamental element, the cost of food. You have to eat. It is inescapable. The economics of consumption are not complex. Consumers are paying more and farmers are getting less. And the Gover(cid:173)ment tells us that we spent 14 percent more for food this summer than we did last summer; 14 percent is bad enough, but it certainly seems to hurt more than 14 percent. It is the increasing price of food and our inability to deal effectively with these costs that is probably the largest single source of frustration for the American consumer. It is in how we spend our food dollar, or what we cannot buy with our food dollar, that is one of the cruelest punishments of inflation. The average American wage earner pays about 20 percent of his income for food. For the older American, it is over 30 percent of his income. The individual has already been fed his diet of austerity. It is evi(cid:173)dent that \"tight money\" or \"fiscal re(cid:173)straint\" alone is not a satisfactory solu(cid:173)tion to this problem. Nor can the problem be dismissed alone by the cold calculus of demand over supply. A meaningful discussion of problem and resolution must include an understanding of the data employed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tells us that prices for food at home have in(cid:173)creased percent during the year beginning in July 1973 and ending this past summer. I believe that this figure represents a serious distortion of what is really happening to the American diet and obscures real problems in our food distribution and marketing system. Basically, the food price index of the Consumer Price Index is based on the increase of cost in about 100 selected food items. Each item is weighted in relation to its importance in the American diet. A tottering system, based upon 1961 eat(cid:173)ing habits, the BLS idea has not been updated to reflect changes in our eating habits. For example, meats are weighted heavily in the BLS system, and meat prices are down 9.6 percent over the last year. So this holds the index down. But at the same time, Americans are eat(cid:173)ing less meat; 6 percent less beef than last year, and nearly 20 percent less pork from 1971 levels. It also happens that pork is generally eaten more than beef by: the less affluent members of our so(cid:173)ciety. So it is not coincidental that we are eating less meat and more beans. Meat prices have decreased 9.6 percent, but dried beans have increased 300 percent. So while the Government tells us that it is only costing us 14 percent more, we know that it is costing us more than that. Salt Lake City is not one of the cities sampled by the BLS. We have been in(cid:173)formed, however, that Salt Lake City is 14 October 15, 197 4 one of the four most expensive cities for food in the United States. An indepen(cid:173)dent study has been done in a large dis(cid:173)count grocery store, comparing June 8, 1973, retail prices with the shelf prices of September 16, indicates that something is very wrong. Common brand name foods that are typical of the aver(cid:173)age American's eating habits were selected. The 1973 products were picked first, on the basis of diet, and then a comparison was made with this Septem(cid:173)ber's prices. 1974.

I ask unanimous consent that two members of my personal stat! be on the floor during the ceremony today, and their names will be supplied to the Ser-geant at Arms. . The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD subsequently said: Mr. President, I also overlooked four cloakroom arttendants on each side. I ask unanimous consent that they be granted the privilege of the floor during the ceremony today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. Presi(cid:173)dent, I have been put in the position of making these requests, but I have done so in fairness to all. We have to keep in mind that Members of the House of Representatives-and they number only 435-also will have the privilege of this floor today. So I suggest that we not proceed with any further unanimous-consent re(cid:173)quests that persons be allowed the privilege of the floor. The walls will be stacked several persons deep when the Members of the House arrive. I just make this announcement in the hope that there will be no requests for aids or clerks to Senators. I would not have asked for two for myself-I never have an aid on the floor, except for a few minutes at a time-but in this instance I did ask for two, because the distinguished Repub(cid:173)lican leader asked for two, and he is entitled to two. Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD subsequently said: Mr. President, I am almost at the point of apologizing for continuing to ask for additional persons on the floor today, because so many Members of the House will be on the Senate floor. How(cid:173)ever, I ask that instead of two mem(cid:173)bers of my staff, only one be on the floor, and that as a substitute for the other one, MJ;. Bob Dove, who is an assistant parliamentarian \u00b7and who is very diligent, always very courteous, and most helpful to all Senators, be given the privilege of the floor during the cere(cid:173)mony.

Mr. President, a term of 6 years in the U.S. Senate of!ers great opportunity for an individual to serve his country, his State, and his fel(cid:173)low man. To be chosen' by one's fellow citi~ens to represent them in this body is in itself a high honor and no small achievement. My senior colleague from Kentucky, Mr. CooK, is completing his tenure. Sen(cid:173)ator CooK has served the people of Ken(cid:173)tucky well, as those of you who have served with him know. He has diligently applied himself to the problems and is(cid:173)sues that have confronted Congress. It is no sur:prise to me that Senator CooK's work here has been recognized and ac(cid:173)knowledged in many places. Although we are from different par(cid:173)ties, our friendship long predates his en(cid:173)try into the U.S Senate. I observed his performance in the State legislature in Kentucky and his subsequent duty as county judge of our largest county, Jef(cid:173)ferson. Senator CooK devoted many years working for the betterment of the State prior to entering the U.S. Senate. That service was extended and expanded during his membership here. I feel I would be remiss, if I did not here publicly acknowledge the tremen(cid:173)dous assistance that my senior colleague and his stat! have extended to me as a new Member of this body during the past 2 years, and I want to express my ap(cid:173)preciation for that help and cooperation, and extend to him and to his family my best wishes in whatever new endeavors he undertakes.

The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro(cid:173)ceeded to call the roll. Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD.

Most of the prepara(cid:173)tion and training has been occurring on the job. Today, there are approximately 150 nurse practitioners who have been prepared through VA-university based programs.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be stated by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 467) relating to agrt(cid:173)cultural credit and the current Uquldity problem facing agricultural borrowers that threatens the vtiablllty of agriculture, rural communities, and the national economy. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to its consideraition. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, this is a sense oif the Senate resolution approv:ed unanimously by the Committee on Ag~\u00adculture and Forestry, which calls on the Government lending agencies and private lenders to give every consideration to the credit needs of agriculture during these critical times. Notwithstanding the fact that this is a committee resolution, I ask unanimous consent that the names of the distin(cid:173)guished Senator from Oklahoma BARTLETT) and the distinguished Sena(cid:173)tor from Florida (Mr. CHILES) be added as cosponsors. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (Mr. FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS MUST RESPOND POSI(cid:173)TIVELY TO THWART AN AGRICULTURAL CRED(cid:173)IT DISASTER Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, at my in(cid:173)stance, the Senate Committee on Agri(cid:173)culture and Forestry unanimously re(cid:173)ported ,senate Resolution 467 which deals with the increasingly serious credit crunch in which many of the Nation's farmers now find themselves. There is no need for me to recount in any detail on the serious economic conditions which now prevail in Ala(cid:173)bama and generally in America. But the rapidly increasing unemployment rate and many other f aotors are grim remind(cid:173)ers of the terrible Depression of the 1930's. I would, however, remind the Senat.e that prior to that general economic col(cid:173)lapse, our farm economy fell apar,t. Due to a lack of liquidity there were whole(cid:173)sale foreclosures on farmers. That same specter is raising its ugly head today. Since 1971, in response to Government urging for all-out food production, farm(cid:173)ers expanded their borrowing by 60 per(cid:173)cent. This was in order to purchase the essential inputs which are vital in food production. Much of this debt was incur(cid:173)red at record high interest rates. Farmers were able to take these credit risks because of record demand for their food and fiber and resulting good prices. But all of that has changed. In the past 2 years the livestock, Poul(cid:173)try, antl dairy segments of our farm econ(cid:173)omy have been decimated by higher costs of production; market disruptions and drastically lower prices. Markets for cotton have been depressed because American families, in their at(cid:173)tempts to fight in:flation, have sharply reduced their clothing budgets. In addition, many crop farmers have had a variety of disasters which made their labor and investment a cataclysmic mockery. In spite of generally high grain prices, many farmers lost everything. As a result of this, farmers are being forced to assume even greater debts in order to refinance their pending obliga(cid:173)tions and many others are simply going out of business. Although I have not been able to find any statistics on this, my mail and per(cid:173)sonal contracts with constituents make me certain that the number of farm bankruptcies ls increasing rapidly. The loss of these farmers to the sys(cid:173)tem is a direct threat to the need for IUY increased food production for America and the world. This production base must be strong if we are to meet the double(cid:173)barreled problems of inflation and re(cid:173)cession. Further. the agriculture economy lies, at the heart of the viability of small communities. We are already aware that many rural banks have reduced their lending significantly and some have closed their doors for good. The financial liquidity of the family farm must be preserved if we are to as(cid:173)sure adequate food supplies at fair and reasonable prices. As a result of this desperate situation, the Committee on Agriculture and For(cid:173)estry has resolved that agricultural lend(cid:173)ers immediately respond to the credit needs of agriculture. Chairman TALMADGE has resolved that immediately after the first of the year, the Committee will re(cid:173)examine the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 in order to insure a fair return to the farmers. But unless agricultural lenders do their part now, those efforts will be too late. Therefore, all of those institutions which farmers rely on for credit must use every means possible to assure agri(cid:173)cultural solvency-this includes the mer(cid:173)chants who sell vital inputs for farming. Further, the Farmers Home Adminis(cid:173)tration must fully implement all lend(cid:173)ing authority in law, including the Emergency Livestock Credit Act of 1974 and other disaster aid programs. The Farm Credit Administration must use its good offices to the fullest extent possible to insure that adequate credit is made available to farmers. Finally, the Federal Reserve Board must fully support those commercial banks which represent the largest source of farm production credit. Mr. President, I can understand that in these troubled economic times, many lenders might feel it wiser to restrict their loan activities sharply. But farmers continue to exist almost solely on the basis of huge annual loans which are essential to the production of food in this country. Any wavering in support for this credit system by any of the vital in(cid:173)stitutions involved will certainly produce famine abroad and much higher food prices at home. This is not to mention the disruption of farm families and rural communities. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has just completed the week-long exer(cid:173)cise of its annual Outlook Conference. In my mind it was more of a back look con(cid:173)ference, reflecting on what a good year last year was instead of the impending problems which any casual observer can foresee for the coming year in the entire food and fiber sector. If we cannot rely on the Department of Agriculture for this information, then it seems to me that it is incumbent upon Congress to come to some determination of how the problem of financial liquidity will affect the farmers themselves, the economy of rural areas and the American housewife. I intend to undertake a personal sur(cid:173)vey in my own State of Alabama, con(cid:173)versing with farmers, bankers, and mer(cid:173)chants wherever I can find them. ",
            "104": "1 41122 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE December 19, 197 4 have to disapprove such a reorganization plan by joint resolution within 60 days, and if the President vetoes this joint resolution, the Congress could override the veto by a two-thirds vote in both Houses. If the reorganization plan should be defeated, Mr. President, then the Com(cid:173)munity Services Administration would continue as an independent agency in the executive branch thereafter. Under a provision I first originated and advocated in conference, the vote on the resolution would be guaranteed in both Houses, under the Reorganization Act procedures in chapter 9 of title V, United States Code. The bill further provides new legis(cid:173)lative authority for Head Start with a new nationwide allocation formula for funding Follow Through and Native American programs in HEW. And al(cid:173)though I would have much preferred the 80-percent Federal, 20-percent across(cid:173)the-board local share of costs for CAP's whic~ was contained in the Senate bill, the bill as reported from conference re(cid:173)tains this 80/20 cost share for the first year for CAP's receiving under $300,000. In the second year, this would be re(cid:173)duced to 75/25, and in the third year, 70/30. Importantly, the Director may approve in excess of these amounts if he determines, in accordance with objective regulations, that this would be appro-priate. \u2022 The bill as passed by the Senate also contained a provision I authored, in sec(cid:173)tion 1102 (d) of the new title XI, which earmarked, out of all funds allocated for research, demonstration, and pilot projects, 25 percent of these funds to be made available for Community Action programs to carry out such projects. This was designed to give these CAP agen(cid:173)cies some versatile funds with which they could implement new designs and di(cid:173)rections in antipoverty programs. The conference agreement concerns the thrust of this provision by requir(cid:173)ing that the CSA Director be given due. consideration to CAP's requests for re(cid:173)search and demonstration funding. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAMS Mr. President, in addition to Com(cid:173)munity Action, Head Start, and Follow Through, I particularly am gratified that a number of important programs would be continued by this measure. DESIGN AND PLANNING ASSISTANCE Community-based design and plan(cid:173)ning organizations would continue receive financial assistance for technical assistance and professional architectural and related services. This is a special pro(cid:173)vision-section 226-which I authored in the Economic Opportunity Amend(cid:173)ments of 1972, Public Law 92-424. to CONSUMER ACTION AND COOPERATIVE PROGRAMS This program was designed t.o aid low(cid:173)income individuals and groups in en(cid:173)forcing consumer rights, and to protect such individuals and groups against un(cid:173)fair or discriminatory trade and com(cid:173)mercial practices by providing assistance with the development and operation of consumer action, advocacy, and coopera(cid:173)tive programs, credit resources develop(cid:173)ment programs, consumer protection, and education programs. These pro(cid:173)grams-under section 228 which I also authored in Public Law 92-424-will also be continued under the committee bill. SENIOR OPPORTUNITIES AND SERVICES This program is designed to meet some of the special, unmet needs of elderly persons, particularly health, employ(cid:173)ment, housing, consumer, and welfare. RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION In addition to seeking information con(cid:173)cerning the causes of poverty, research activities provide for the development of workable models and innovative pro(cid:173)grams that help Federal, State, and local agencies to meet the needs of the poor. MIGRANT AND SEASONAL FARMWORKERS The conference agreement provides that the Director shall coordinate pro(cid:173)grams for migrant and seasonal farm(cid:173)workers with other Federal programs designed to assist or serve such farm(cid:173)workers. Additionally, the Director is re(cid:173)quired to give special consideration to any public or priv\u00b5,te nonprofit agency which has previously received assistance for the provision of services for migrant and other seasonally employed farm(cid:173)workers and their families. go unnoticed by one very large group of people-the tens of millions of poor peo(cid:173)ple, who would have no measure of re(cid:173)lief at all, if these programs did not exist. The antipoverty program does not, Mr. President, come anywhere near meeting all our concerns and all our \u00b7 responsibilities toward helping poor per(cid:173)sons improve their lives and opportun(cid:173)ities. But it is an important symbol of our resolution to continue to fight-and hopefully win-the war on poverty, and I believe we are morally obliged to keep it going-to keep faith with the poor(cid:173)by passing this reasonable measure. In truth, we should be doing much, much more. I urge adoption of the conference re(cid:173)port and pray that the President, in the spirit which should animate this season, will sign this bill as a fair and hopeful compromise measure. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further discussion? Mr. JAVITS. I yield back the remain(cid:173)der of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques(cid:173)tion is on agreeing to the conference re(cid:173)port. CHILDREN WITH LIMITED ENGLISH-SPEAKING ABILITY Importantly, the conference report provides that, in administering Head Start and Follow Through programs, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare do all he can to meet the special needs of Indian and migrant children, and the joint explanatory statement stresses that the Secretary shall be espe(cid:173)cially sensitive to the needs of children with limited English-speaking ability in order to enhance the effect of these pro(cid:173)grams on these children. I was glad that these matters were resolved as I proposed in the conference. EMERGENCY ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM I was pleased that the bulk of the Senate amendment establishing an em\u00b7ergency energy conservation program t.o lessen the impact of the high cost of energy for low-income individuals was retained in the conference report. The conference agreement requires the Di(cid:173)rector of the Community Services Ad(cid:173)ministration to consult with the Admin(cid:173)istrator of the Federal Energy Agency and other appropriate departments and agencies prior to establishing the proce(cid:173)dures to carry out the purposes of this program. CONCLUSION Mr. President, in closing I would like to stress that the poverty programs dis(cid:173)cussed above, and others contained in the reported bill, have demonstrated their effectiveness in helping to meet the needs of the poor. In \"An Analysis of the Economic Impact of a Community Ac(cid:173)tion Agency,\" prepared by the Techni(cid:173)cal ;\\ssistance Division of the California State Office of Economic Opportunity the introduction states-' Because bad news makes news, the posi(cid:173)tive and vital contributions made by Com(cid:173)munity Action Agencies may have been lost or have gone virtually unnoticed. I can assure you, Mr. President, the contribution of poverty programs do not SENATE RESOLUTION 468-EX-PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE DISAPPROVING THE RE(cid:173)CENT STEEL PRICE INCREASE Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send to the desk a Senate resolution and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr. CHILES). The resolution will be stated. The legislative clerk read as follows: Whereas United States Steel has an(cid:173)nounced price increases averaging 8 to 10% on two thirds of steel items produced by the Company. Whereas steel prices of major companies including U.S. Steel were increased by an average of 23 % last spring. Whereas U.S. Steel has indicated it will persist in these price increases even though it has not yet given President Ford the jus(cid:173)tification for these price increases that he has requested. Whereas for the first nine months of 1974 U.S. Steel's profits increased by 109.4% over the first nine months of 1973. Whereas an increase in the price of steel will have a deleterious effect on the already sagging auto and construction industries. Whereas an increase in the price of steel will place upward pressure on many con(cid:173)sumer prices: Now, therefore, be it Resolved,. That the Council on Wage and Price Stability be requested t,o hold hearings on both the price increase announced by U.S. Steel and price increases that have been put into effect by other steel producers since July 1, 1974. Be it Resolved, That the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission be re(cid:173)quested to investigate the steel industry to determine whether the industry is guilty of violations of Antitrust Laws; be it therefore Resolved, That U.S. Steel specifically and the remainder of the Steel industry gener(cid:173)ally be notified that it is the strong deSire of the U.S. Senate that no increase in the price of steel be put into effect until the rec(cid:173)ommended. hearings of the Council on Wage and Price Stab111ty have been held and the Council's report has been made; and, finally, be it Resolved, That the President use the full ",

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENAT;E December 19, 1974 ning programs, and for other purposes, hav(cid:173)ing met, after full and free conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there \"bjection to the consideration of the con(cid:173)ference report? There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the report. (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the CONGRES(cid:173)SIONAL RECORD of today). Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am particularly pleased to report that the conferees met and agreed upon what I believe to be an excellent bill. This leg(cid:173)islation will authorize the establishment of local and State agencies for the de(cid:173)velopment of comprehensive health plans under national guidelines to be de(cid:173)veloped by the Secretary of Health, Edu(cid:173)cation, and Welfare. This legislation au(cid:173)thorizes the creation of health systems agencies, which will encompass the en(cid:173)tire United States. In addition, it pro(cid:173)vides funds for the implementation of plans developed by the agencies, and the continuation of meritorious health de(cid:173)velopment projects currently being funded under existing authorities, such as the regional medical programs. It also provides for continuation of Federal as(cid:173)sistance for the construction of out(cid:173)patient facilities with an emphasis on medically underserved areas and mod(cid:173)ernization of existing inpatient facilities. The special project grant program is ear(cid:173)marked to assist urban hospitals in meet(cid:173)ing life safety and accreditation stand-ards. \u00b7 \u00b7 The amount of $1.13 billion is author:(cid:173)ized for a 3-year period. Although this authorization is somewhat higher than the Senate bill which went into confer(cid:173)ence, I believe the additional expendi(cid:173)tures are justified. They are due primar(cid:173)ily to increased authority for continu(cid:173)ation of the construction program and the creation of five centers for health planning, to be in operation by June 1976. In addition, an experimental State(cid:173)operated program of health service rate regulation under Federal guidelines is included in this legislation. The most compelling reason for our immediate action on S. 2994 rests with the strong potential for enactment of some form of national health insurance in the near future. In all of the hearings that have been held on national health insurance and through the volumes of material that have been written on the subject, considerable stress has been given to benefit packages and the finan(cid:173)cial mechanisms for supporting such a program. Such a focus has been appro(cid:173)priate, since they are major elements in any program: However, a major out(cid:173)growth of this stress has been an increas(cid:173)ing concern for physical and human re(cid:173)sources. Specifically, will there be enough resources, appropriate to the needs, and distributed in a manner so as to effec(cid:173)tively meet the demand that will be gen(cid:173)erated through a national health insur(cid:173)ance program? This concern leads into the question of planning and the need for an effective planning base if we are to successfully implement national health insurance. Up to this point, adequate attention has not been given to this very real question. However, we can change that situation today within the context of this bill. Quite frankly, S. 2994 gives us the ca(cid:173)pacity to implement a comprehensive planning base throughout the United States. Even more important, though, is that this can be done with a time interval that provides an opportunity to plan for national health insurance. What exactly does this bill do as far as the planning for national health in-. surance is concerned? First of all, it will support the creation of a system of regional health planning agencies throughout the country. This is contrasted with the existing situation under the comprehensive health plan(cid:173)ning program where only 75 percent of the population is covered by an areawide health planning agency. The areas cur(cid:173)rently not covered are largely rural, but under s. 2994 they would now have the opportunity to participate in regional health planning. Second. The bill would provide the fi(cid:173)nancial resources necessary to employ both the number and types of staff nec(cid:173)essary to tackle the planning issues posed by national health insurance. Under S. 2994 regional health planning agencies ho.ve a minimum professional staff of 10 compared with the average of 4 under existing comprehensive health planning program. Third. S. 2994 targets the planning ac(cid:173)tivities on the personal service needs of the population and the manpower and facilities necessary to meet the needs. Finally, the bill fosters the creation of regional decisionmaking bodies encom(cid:173)passing providers, consumers, educators, payors, and local elected officials who in conjunction with appropriately educated professional staff can make planning and resource allocation recommendations which will go a long way toward insuring an effective implementation of a national health insurance program on a local level. There is a second important reason for the Senate to move positively on this bill today. The concepts expressed in S. 2994 have \u00b7been under discussion for a num(cid:173)ber of years. We are aware that the administration over 1 % years ago pro(cid:173)posed the termination of regional medi(cid:173)cal programs and Hill-Burton. The Congress responded by calling for a sim(cid:173)ple 1-year extension of the existing pro(cid:173)grams, with the expressed intent of studying the programs under considera-\u00b7 tion. I believe that this was a sound move on the part of the Congress. While this action permitted us to carry out this essential review, it also had an adverse effect on the programs themselves. The 1-year extension was a signal to many that the Congress was going to make some significant changes in the near fu(cid:173)ture. This lack of stability made it diffi(cid:173)cult for many programs to maintain and/or hire the high-quality personnel necessary to carry out program responsi(cid:173)bilities. In other cases, it was hard to get communities to develop quality proposals which were responsive \u00b7 to community needs since the future support of such efforts was clearly uncertain. The study the Congress authorized has been completed. We have heard from many people and have incorporated their ideas into our own analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the exist(cid:173)ing programs. The end result is a bill which significantly enhances our ability to deal with planning, implementation, and construction in a coordinated and effective fashion. The time for action is now and there is no reason to delay the implementa(cid:173)tion of the concepts expressed in S. 2994. To do so would mean that the Senate would be avoiding its responsibility and obligation to insure that programs are enacted which will benefit the total pop(cid:173)ulation. Furthermore, nonaction by the Senate will only perpetuate the uncer(cid:173)tainty and instability that now faces 56 State comprehensive health planning agencies, 218 areawide comprehensive health planning agencies, 53 regional medical programs, 56 State Hill-Burton agencies, 17 experimental health services delivery systems, and their respective , constituencies. A third rationale for immediate action linked to the authority for develop(cid:173)is ment activities . .AJ3 is well known, the re(cid:173)gional medical programs have served as a vehicle for the development of a num(cid:173)ber of initiatives both on State and re(cid:173)gional level. While many of the activities were consistent with community needsr, a large number of the projects were re\u00b7 search projects tied to the interests of medical school faculty. This bill gives us the capacity to benefit from the strengths of the regional medical pro(cid:173)grams experience by supporting devel(cid:173)opmental projects which are responsive to the priorities set forth in a regional agency's short-term priorities plan. More importantly though this provision will allow communities to positively at(cid:173)tack resource deficiencies that they all face in some form. Of even greater sig(cid:173)nificance though is that the authority gives real meaning and substance to the planning that will be taking place.. In many parts of the country, under the existing comprehensive health planning program, planning agencies have been frustrated by their inability to get their planning priorities implemented in a vi(cid:173)able format. There has been no man(cid:173)dated link between the planning under comprehensive health planning and the development under regional medical programs. S. 2994 rectifies this very con(cid:173)dition. Furthermore, if we think back to the earlier discussion about the ties between national health insurance and planning and resource needs, we see the real promise this provision holds. \u00b7 Another reason for an immediate de(cid:173)cision on this bill rests on the question of need for facilities and services. For a number of years this country has wrestled with the problem of how to get facilities and services into areas where they are needed. To a large extent, we have been successful, as witnessed by the Hill-Burton program. Increasingly, ",

They're the domestic Kremlinologists of American eco(cid:173)nomics. The reasons for the secrecy aren't sinister. It's supposed to discourage sharp traders from cashing in on the information, but the rumors, tips, speculation and purportedly inside dope swirling about the Fed would seem to have exactly the opposite effect from the one intended. However that may be, the nation's pros(cid:173)perity is still hugely affected by 11 guys who nobody has ever heard of, operating as a committee that everybody is ignorant of. Congress can struggle to balance the budget and the fruits of its fiscal responsibility can be canceled out by policy decisions that aren't even announced until three months after they're made. In this clandestine nonsense Burns is but following the ancient traditions of his orga(cid:173)nization. He isn't the first man to orches(cid:173)trate disaster in a closet. History teaches us that the same kind of secretive, well-inten(cid:173)tioned madness brought on the massive bank closings of 1932-33 and the recessionary col(cid:173)lapse of 1937 which prolonged the Great Depression another dreary, unnecessary four years. Even now it's suspected-nobody outside the Fed can know for sure-that our mone(cid:173)tary policies have been turned around 180 degrees, that the Fed is building the founda(cid:173)tions of a new inflationary rush. It's possible that if the Fed made its decisions out in the open they'd still make the same mistakes, but, since\u00b7 the citizenry must pay the conse(cid:173)quences, the least the Ped can do is to go public and thereby give the rest of us fair warnin:;. in the strategy sessions. Our sources say the President is willing to use United States military power as a last resort to prevent the oil cartel from causing disastrous economic and political dislocations in the West.\" Such frightening and threatening speculation by the President is demoralizing, especially keeping in mind his continual failure to act against the price gouging on the part of the major oil companies and his repeated failure to spark any anti-trust action a,gainst the major oil companies. Also in the Anderson column of last week is the following statement. \"Just as the United States didn't try to stop the Soviet Union from invading Czechoslovakia, Kis(cid:173)singer believes the Soviet wouldn't likely risk a nuclear war with the United States over Mid East oil.\" The analogy between the So(cid:173)viet Union going in to Czechoslovakia and the United States taking over an independ(cid:173)ent, sovereign Arab country is at best absurd. The relationship between the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact nations is completely dif(cid:173)ferent than the relationship of the United States and the Arab bloc countries. Given the Russian interest in Middle East oil and Russian Naval superiority in the Medite:t:(cid:173)ranean and ground troop concentration along its borders with Iran and Turkey, it's ridiculous to think the soviet Union would sit idly by while the United States sent Ma(cid:173)rines in to take over Arabian oil fields. Americans should be aware of these subtle attempts to manuever public opinion into hating \"Arab types\" which would be the first step in preparing the public to accept a hos(cid:173)tile situation in the Middle East in which the United States could be one of the bellig(cid:173)erent nations involved in the conflict. THE MIDDLE EAST Mr. ABOUREZK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD an editorial written by Rob(cid:173)ert Martin, editor of the University of South Dakota newspaper, Volante. Mr. Martin's editorial view manifests a great deal more rationality on the Mid(cid:173)dle East question than exists in many sources of opinion today. There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the University of South Dakota news(cid:173)paper, Volante, S. Dak., Nov. 19, 1974) PUBLIC OPINION MANEUVERED To ACCEPT WAR There has been growing speculation on the part of military and political leaders that it may become a necessity to effect a military takeover of oil fields under the sovererign control of Arab nations if the oil \"price gouge\" continues to affect our \"vital in(cid:173)terests,\" as they state. This change in attitude by political and military leaders has been accompanied by the derrogatory characterization of Arabs as big, greedy, money-hungry slobs. As an ex(cid:173)ample of this, this week's political cartoon was especially selected to help emphasize the point. Also, witness over the past few week's cartoons in Time Magazine showing much the same stereotype of an Arab taking a b:i.te out of the world with the caption stating, \"Arab burger.\" In a recent column Jack Anderson stated that the \"repercussions of Western countries being economically ruined by the price of oil would affect the vital interests of the United States. The use of the term vital in~rests is ominous. For it is understood that the United States will go to war, if necessary, to protect its vital interests.\" According to An(cid:173)derson, one top policymaker compared the oil gouge by Arab nations to Pearl Harbor.

Maybe even worse, when the minerals collect in runoff water in toxic concentrations, they destroy fish and plant life wherever these waters flow. Unfortunately there have been no specific and detailed analyses of what it costs to correct this particular impact of surface min(cid:173)ing. Removing sediment from streams--or preventing it from going there in the first place-have been viewed as integral parts of land reclamation, and it has been assumed that the cost of reclamation covers the cost of coping with sedimentation as well. This is probably a safe assumption if the reclamation is really first-rate. If it is not then specific actions must be taken to pre(cid:173)vent erosion and remove sediment from mine water, and those actions cost money. Since the reclamation analyzed and recommended in this article is of high quality and in(cid:173)cludes a high degree of concern for these problems, no separate cost will be assessed for control of sedimentation. DIMINISHED RECREATIONAL VALUE One cost of surface mining that is fre(cid:173)quently forgotten is the diminished recrea(cid:173)tional value of disfigured land and polluted water. Hunters, campers, hikers, :fishermen, and swimmers spend money in pursuit of their sports, and this expenditure is lost or greatly diminished when areas are ravaged by surface mining. A study pubUshed in 1968 by the Bureau of Sports Fisheries and Wildlife in the Depart(cid:173)ment of the Interior stated that approxi(cid:173)mately 3.2 million acres of land had been surface-mined (for all minerals, not just coal) in the U.S. from the beginning of min(cid:173)ing through 1967. Two million of these acres (or about two-thirds) were fish and wildlife habitat damaged by the mining. The study then estimated that, if there were \"minimal or basic reclamation that would control silt, sediment, and acid pollution\" on these 2 mil(cid:173)lion acres, two changes would occur: the number of man-days of use of the land by sportsmen would increase from 7 .5 million to 40 million per year, and the recreational value of the land would therefore increase from $10 million to $58 million per year. In other words, reclaiming 2 million acres of fish and game habitat would give a pay(cid:173)off (in terms of increased use by sportsmen) of $48 million per year, or $24 per acre per year. Or, worded still another way, whenever an acre of surface-mined fish and game habi(cid:173)tat is unreclaimed, it costs society $24 per year in terms of its diminished recreational value. How do we translate these figures into a per-ton cost for surface-mined coal? Taking it step by step: (1) We have already shown earlier in this article that an estimated 1.5 million acres will have to be stripped to obtain the 12 billion tons of surface-mined coal projected for the period 1970-2000. On the basis of past experience, this would mean that roughly two-thirds of this acreage, or 1 million acres, would be fish and game habitat. (2) More thari just the 1 million acres of habitat will be affected by the stripping how(cid:173)ever, since use of adjacent land is also often impaired. The Bureau of Sports Fisheries and Wildlife has reported that for every acre of land distributed in Appalac'hia iby surface mining, use of an additional 1.25 acres has been impaired-denied to hunters, campers, hikers, and fishermen because of highwalls, piles of mine refuse, and tearing up of the landscape by machinery and trucks. So the surface mining of 1 million acres of fish and game habitat during the 30-year period would result in the impairment of an esti(cid:173)mated total of 2.25 mill1on acres. (3) If each unreclaimed acre of habitat costs society $24 per year in reduced recre(cid:173)ational use, the total cost of 2.25 million im(cid:173)paired acres would be $54 million ( $24 times 2.25 million) for each year these acres are being mined or are not yet reclaimed after mining is completed. (4) The next question is: How many years, on the average, will these surface-mined acres be out of commission as far as hunters and fishermen are concerned? Harry Perry estimates that an average of three to five years elapses from the time mining begins until reclamation can be started. But this is only the beginning. Some time is required to do the reclamation itself, although con(cid:173)current reclamation-reclaiming as you go during the mining operation-is more and more common. Even more significant, a long period of time must pass before the ecologi(cid:173)cal balance is restored so that fish and game are again available to sportsmen. Many things must happen, and some take longer than others. Fish populations must be re(cid:173)plenished by introducing native species into the streams or ponds. There must be a re(cid:173)growth of ground cover dense enough to attract native animals back to the mined areas-and this means time to grow bushes and small trees as well as grass. These things do not happen quickly. Willard M. Spaulding, Jr., deputy regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, estimates that after first-rate reclamation work has been com(cid:173)pleted, it still takes an additional ten years, on the average, to develop an ecosystem that will allow sportsmen to harvest fish and game. Thomas Flynn of the Division of En(cid:173)vironment, Bureau of Mines, confirms this estimate. On the basis of this testimony, we assume in our analysis that it takes a total of fifteen years, on the average, to surface-mine habi(cid:173)tat land, to do first-class reclamation, and then to restore the fish and animal popula(cid:173)tions so that sportsmen will again find the mined areas attractive. We are now ready to calculate the per-ton social cost that results from the diminished recreational value of fish and game habitat. Remember that the total loss of recreational value has been estimated to be $54 million for each year the 2.25 million surface-mined acres were not available to sportsmen. If we multiply this $54-million annual cost by fifteen years (the average out-of-commis(cid:173)sion\" time) , the result is a total cost of $810 million, or $0.0676 per ton for the 12 billion tons of surface-mined coal projected for the period 1970-2000. LOSS OF POTENTIAL PRODUCTION In calculating the loss of potential pro(cid:173)duction due to accidents in surface mining, the method used is the same as that used for deep mining. First, the loss will be calcu(cid:173)lated for nonfatal disabling accidents. Item ( 1) . Number of nonfatal disabling accidents predicted for surface mines be(cid:173)tween 1970-2000. Bureau of Mines figures for 1971 show that there were 25.86 nonfatal dis(cid:173)abling accidents per million man-hours in surface mines. The Bureau of Mines also re(cid:173)ported that in 1971 the average productivity in surface mining was approximately 4.5 tons per man-hour. At that rate it would take 2.667 billion (or 2,667 million) man-hours to mine the 12 billion\u00b7 tons of surface-mined coal projected for that period. The number of nonfatal disabling acci(cid:173)dents would therefore be 2,667 tmes 25.86, or 68,970. For ease in calculation this number will be rounded to 69,000. Thus, item (1) in the formula is 69,000. Item (2). The average number of days lost from work per accident is 52. Item (3). The average daily earnings coal mining are $47. Calculation of the formula in the box on page 24. If the total cost of $168,000,000 is divided by the 12 billion tons of coal projected to be surface-mined during the 1970-2000 period, we find that the average loss of earnings due to nonfatal disabling accidents in surface mines would be $0.014 per ton of coal mined is as shown in (at 1973 wage rates) . As was true for deep mining, this estimate can be used as a meas(cid:173)ure of the loss of potential production caused by such accidents. The loss of earnings from fatal accidents is calculated as follows: Item (1), Number of fatal accidents pre(cid:173)dicted for surface mines between 1970-2000. Bureau of Mines figures for 1971 show 0.45 fatal accidents per million man-hours.17 Since surface mining 12 billion tons of coal will require 2,667 million man-hours, the total number of fatal accidents would be 2,667 times 0.4\u00b75, or 1,200. Item (1) in the fraction is 1,200. Item (2). The average number of days lost or charged per fatal accident is 6,000. Item (3). The average daily earnings in coal mining are $4 7. Calculation of the formula is as shown in the box on page 24. If the total cost of $338,400,000 is divided by the 12 billion tons of coal projected to be surface-mined during the 1970-2000 period, we find that the average loss of earnings due to fatal accidents in surface mines would be $0.028 per ton of coal mined (at 1973 wage rates). This loss of earnings can be used to measure the loss of potential production due to fatal accidents. The combined loss of potential production (as measured by lost earnings) in surface mines during the 1970-2000 period is as follows: Due to nonfatal $0.014 per ton. Due to fatal accidents, $0.028 per ton. Total loss of potential production due to accidents in surface mines $0.042 per ton. The estimated social costs of surface(cid:173)mined coal are summarized in Table 3. They add up to $1.003 per ton, or a total of $12.033 billion for the 12 billion tons projected to be deep-mined during the period 1970-2000. accidents, disabling EFFECT ON COST AND PRICE\u00b7 How much would the cost of producing coal increase if the social costs were added? It is impossible to answer this question, for the simple reason that it is impossible to get any authoritative information as to what production costs are in the coal industry. Coal companies consider production costs to be confidential information, and the Bureau of Mines does not gather data on the subject. We can, however, indicate what the effect would be if social costs were added to aver(cid:173)age selling price, an increase of roughly 9 percent in the price of deep-mined coal and an almost 18 percent increase for surface(cid:173)mined coal. Even here, we are limited by the data available. The calculations are based on average U.S. selling price (F.O.B. the mine) during 1972, the latest year for which aver(cid:173)age figures are available from the Bureau of Mines. Domestic coal prices have subse(cid:173)quently skyrocketed; Harry Perry reports prices as high as $25 to $35 a ton for low(cid:173)sulfur coal during early 1974. Of course, as selling prices rise, the burden of paying social costs becomes relatively less. If deep(cid:173)mined coal is selling for $9.70 per ton, as in 1972, and you add $0.88 in social costs, the price increase is 9 percent. If the selling price goes up to $35 per ton, however, adding the $0.88 will up the price by only about 2 per(cid:173)cent. A WORD OF CAUTION The various costs are not completely in(cid:173)dependent of each other, as we have em(cid:173)phasized several times. For example, effec(cid:173)tive backfilling of deep mines to prevent subsidence would also affect the amount of acid mine drainage from those mines. Ade(cid:173)quate reclamation of a strip-mined area would reduce the acid mine drainage, the sedimentation, and the loss of income from recreation. To make a proper analysis of these interrelationships would require more cost data and an extremely detailed and ",

            "404": "41422 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE December 19, 197 4 This Member has sought to protect the rights of those who have been in opposi(cid:173)tion at all times. As a matter of fact, I regret very much that tha~ pict_ure, which was taken in a very privat.e l~ttle gathering to which I had been invited and to which I went out of court~sy ~e\u00adcause I had been invited by the mmonty staff, portends to show anything other than a simple courtesy on my part to be with the Members of the minority be(cid:173)cause they had asked after w~ had c?n(cid:173)cluded with the hearings. It is nothing more. To read anything in that, an~\u00adthing beyond that, is absolutely unfair and dishonest. Mr. MARTIN of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentle(cid:173)man from Illinois (Mr. McCLORY). Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to speak in support of the rule and a~so say that I share the regret of the chair(cid:173)man that his picture was used, and I think it gave the wrong impression. I am happy the gentleman gave a:n ex(cid:173)planation, and I want to concur m the explanation he made. I would also like to say that the <?o~\u00admittee on Rules has been very fair m granting the 6-hour rule. As a matter of fact, although my colleagues on the other side of the aisle requested an 1-h?ur rule, they are getting the 4 hours which they requested for themselves, becaus~ the rule provides 2 hours to the chairman of the committee and 2 hours to the gen(cid:173)tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KASTEN(cid:173)MEIER). So there are 4 hours provide~ to my colleagues on that side of the aisl~. It seems to me that it is eminently fair that distribution of time has been made as it has been made. I think we should recall that this in(cid:173)vestigation by the House c_ommittee on the Judiciary has been gomg on for 4 months and that we have carried on a thorough and complete investigation. We have had access to FBI reports. We ha:ve examined a vast amount of material which is contained in a large volume which is available to the Members. Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to com(cid:173)mend the chairman of the committee and my colleague, the ranking min~rity member, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUTCHINSON) for the kind of thor(cid:173)oughgoing investigation which has been carried on to illuminate and inform the Members so they can vote intelligently on this subject today. It seems to me that we have a very compelte record available to us. I want to support the appraisal of the nominee that has been made by my col(cid:173)league, the ranking member of the Com(cid:173)mittee on Rules, and I wish to state that I am hopeful that we can get on to the general debate on this subject, and that we may vote to confirm the nominee. I might say that the plans for the swearing-in are not unlike the plans which were made with respect to the other Vice Presidential nominee, Gerald R. Ford, when he was confirmed as Vice President. It seems to me the leadership is the one that has made these plans; it is not the mombers of the committee who have made the plans as to what is going to follow the vote here today. Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Califor(cid:173)nia (Mr. WALDIE). Mr. WALDIE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Speaker and not the unyield(cid:173)ing gentleman from New York (Mr. DE(cid:173)LANEY) for the 5 minutes that were just yielded to me. I want also to suggest that it is precisely that type of attitude on the part of the gentleman from New York, in denying an opportunity to fully debate and to fully examine the facts of tliis nomination, that causes the nomi(cid:173)nation to be viewed with suspicion by many. Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. WALDIE. No, I wili not yield. Mr. Speaker, I ask for regular order. I am not going to yield to the gentleman. I suggest the gentleman can do as he re(cid:173)quired of me--make a point of order of no quorum if he wants some time. Mr. Speaker, I am taking this 5 min(cid:173)utes because there is not sufficient time during general debate, although I am with those Members who appreciate that we have extended the time for debate from 4 hours to 6 hours. Even so, there are those members on this committee who are asking for addi(cid:173)tional time, and they are entitled to it. So the best way we can get time is to use part of this hour on the rule to speak to the issues that we will not be able to address in general debate. One of the problems with the debate and with this issue is this: We have had given to us as of last night a volume con(cid:173)sisting of almost 1,400 pages of hearings of the Committee on the Judiciary. I am fairly familiar with these pages, as are most of the members of the committee, but I dare say that hardly any other Members of the House are familiar with the hearings which the Committee on the Judiciary held. Although I found some objection in terms of the scope of those hearings, they still are quite in(cid:173)structive as to the particular holdings of the nominee and as to the potential use by the nominee of his private wealth contrary to public interest, as well as the actual use of that private wealth. Mr. Speaker, it is very difficult to ex(cid:173)amine Mr. Rockefeller in terms of his concepts of wealth and my concept of wealth. For example, when one ques(cid:173)tions him about the use of $22 million of his f ami}y's money to purchase the office of Governor-and I use that term advisedly-there is not a soul in the world, I am sure, who believes Nelson Rockefeller could have been elected without his family coming up with $20 million-Plus. The nominee does not per(cid:173)ceive $20 million as being a great sum of money. Now, that really is not good for the system. It has little to do with whether wealthy people should be denied access to public office. The question is: Should access to public office be made equally accessible to poor people as well as it was wealthy people? With a Rockefeller in the picture, it is not equally accessible. The nominee says that was an abuse in the past that no longer will occur be(cid:173)cause New York has passed laws pre(cid:173)venting that and the Federal Govern(cid:173)ment has passed laws preventing that. I then asked the nominee: \"Do you agree that was an abuse at the time it was being exercised by you?\" And the nominee said, \"Well, legal.\" I said, \"That really was not the ques(cid:173)tion. Was it ethical? Was it an ethical use of your private wealth?\" The nominee said that he equated that particular issue of morality with legality. And then the most incredulous testi(cid:173)mony of all contained in this record came when I asked the nominee if his testimony before our committee was testimony of direct recollection or if his testimony was testimony of reconstruc(cid:173)tion. He said it was all reconstruction. There was no direct recollection in his testi(cid:173)mony. I said, \"This committee has just been through an episode of listening to one of the most famous voices in this land, the former President of the United States, on tape, advising his staff people how to testify before congressional committees under oath or before courts; and the way to testify, the former President of the United States, Mr. Nixon, said, was to say, 'You don't recall.' \" Reconstruct or reconstruction, no di(cid:173)rect recollection. Those are precisely the words the nominee used before our com(cid:173)mittee. I am suggesting to the House that if the Members have an opportunity to read this record, they will find and conclude as I have, and as did many of the 12 members constituting the majority of the Democrats on that committee, that the nominee, charitably, was less than candid before our committee. It just simply is not correct, as the nominee says, that the loans he made were, in fact, loans. It was apparent, and the nominee admitted, that he made gifts to these individuals prior to their obtaining public employment and subse(cid:173)quent to their leaving public employ(cid:173)ment. But he made \"loans\" in the inter(cid:173)vening intervals between obtaining pub(cid:173)lic employment and ending public em(cid:173)ployment. Moneys given by the nominee to these officials were denominated as loans, loans not containing any interest or bearing any collateral, and loans in(cid:173)evitably forgiven when the nominee left public office so that they could be con(cid:173)verted into a gift without violating a statute of New York. The SPEAKER. The time of the gen(cid:173)tleman from California has expired. Mr. MARTIN of Nebraska. Mr. Speak(cid:173)er. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California <Mr. WIGGINS). Mr. WIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I request the attention of the gentleman from New York <Mr. DELANEY), a member of the Committee on Rules. The division of time under this rule is fairly unique, 2 hours being granted the chairman of the Committee on the Judi-",
            "454": "41472 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE December 19, 197 4 Committee on the Judiciary about the troublesome gifts and loans that have been alluded to in the report and by many Members who have spoken before me. I think these loans and gifts were most unfortunate, to say the least. We have not had any conversation about the con(cid:173)sequences or any other facts or about what may have fiowed following the loans and the gifts. Therefore, I will address myself to any of those Members who are here and who are on the Committee on the Judiciary in order to ask about matters that have not been discussed before. I will address these questions to any Member who wishes to respond. No. 1 : As a consequence of making these loans and gifts, was there any evi(cid:173)dence before the committee concerning resulting undue infiuence or resulting im(cid:173)proper acts or resulting improper deci(cid:173)sions or resulting unjust enrichments? I noticed with interest that the gentle(cid:173)man from California (Mr. ROUSSELOT) mentioned that there had been a charter issued to a bank in China which the Rockefellers had an interest in, but I have had no other information in this regard. So I wonder if any member of the Committee on the Judiciary could en(cid:173)lighten me concerning these matters. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. EVANS of Colorado. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. SARBANES. Of course, the Gov(cid:173)ernor and Dr. Ronan deny that there was any undue infiuence involved with the loans and the gifts. So we have received their denials. Dr. Ronan was, of course, in the posi(cid:173)tion of making enormously important decisions, including the decision leading to the renegotiation of the Triborough Authority bonds at a higher interest rate for the bondholders in order to permit authority funds to be used for mass transit purposes. That negotiation ap(cid:173)parently took place at a meeting involv(cid:173)ing Governor Rockefeller, David Rocke(cid:173)feller, and Dr. Ronan. There is a public interest justification given for 'that de(cid:173)cision. That decision has been attacked and criticized, as well. All I can say to the gentleman is that this is where we are; that is where we are left. But we do have the undisputed fact as to the parties who were involved, and we know now what has been revealed from the loans and gifts as to the nature of the relationship between the Governor and Dr. Ronan. Mr. EVANS of Colorado. Mr. Chair(cid:173)man, this is the question I wish to ask: Was there any information that came to the committee's attention showing that as a result of these gifts and loans, any enri'chment fiowed back to the nomi(cid:173)nee or to his family? Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. EVANS of Colorado. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Chairman, I asked that specific question of both Nelson Rockefeller and Mr. Dilworth, as well as others, and we understood there was no single instance where the use of the Rockefeller political infiuence was em(cid:173)ployed to enrich in any way either Nelson Rockefeller or any member of the family. In addition, there is no evidence that Nelson Rockefeller or his family was en(cid:173)riched in any way by any loans or gifts made by Mr. Rockefeller. Mr. EVANS of Colorado. Mr. Chair(cid:173)man, I have conversed briefiy with the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee on this question prior to this, so I will address the same questions to him that I have to the other members. Has any evidence come before the com(cid:173)mittee as to enrichment which fiowed to the nominee or to his family, or have there been any improper acts fiowing from these gifts or loans which were alluded to? Mr. RODINO. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield, throughout the ex(cid:173)tensive investigation, and during the course of the interrogation, there has been no such indication and there has been no such evidence. As a matter of fact, I might state that I specifically inquired of Dr. Ronan re(cid:173)garding some of these items. I did so because of my interest in the State of New Jersey regarding matters that Dr. Ronan might be involved in as chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. As a consequence of my in(cid:173)terrogation, I was satisfied that Dr. Ronan was not enriched, nor was the nominee enriched as a result, in any way. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair now rec(cid:173)ognizes the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUTCHINSON) . Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio <Mr. AsHBROOK) . Mr. ASHBROOK.. Mr. Chairman, I op(cid:173)pose the confirmation of Nelson A. Rock(cid:173)efeller as Vice President, or for that mat(cid:173)ter, for anything. I cannot help but recall the Broadway critic who once wrote, after viewing opening night on the Great White Way, \"A creeping paralysis set in which turned out to be the plot.\" In my view, there has been nothing short of paralysis in the Congress and in the news media in the Rockefeller matter. It amounts to a crass double standard in which most legislators and reporters have fall en over themselves in heaping hosannas on the nominee. It can be ar(cid:173)gued that time spent on the Rockefeller hearings constitute adequate study. Time should not be confused with depth. Because of this paralysis, the nomina(cid:173)tion of Nelson Rockefeller has not re(cid:173)ceived the type of minute attention that the cases of former President Nixon and former Vice President Agnew received. I should think that this body would have learned something from these past sev(cid:173)eral years. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be the case. I ask all of my colleagues: Have the necessary questions been asked and sat(cid:173)isfactorily answered by this nominee? Has this body had an opportunity to con(cid:173)scientiously and unhurriedly study the record of the hearings on this nomina(cid:173)tion? Further, has the standard applied by the press and the Congress to Nixon, Ag(cid:173)new, Harnsworth. and Carswell been ap-plied to Mr. Rockefeller? No, because of this paralysis of will, the former Gov(cid:173)ernor of New York has been subjected to a totally different standard. As a part of this paralysis, an easy out, a wealth herring has been created. Many proponents make it sound like those who oppose Mr. Rockefeller apply a wealth test. This is not so. His wealth has clearly raised questions over misuse of that wealth and power which has come from that wealth but I do not, nor do many opponents I have heard, apply a wealth test to the nominee. I think it important to maintain the same standard for Nelson Rockefeller as maintained for others. That standard is not being maintained , because of a strange paralysis of will. In closing, I wish to ask my fellow Re(cid:173)publican colleagues, do you plan to vote for a man who as Governor was an advo(cid:173)cate of those same liberal policies-big government spending, bigger welfare schemes, and other liberal nostrums(cid:173)that have led this country to its present economic mess? The Republican Party has repeatedly rejected Rockefeller. Pub(cid:173)lic support for his nomination is lacking. I particularly reject the Republican at(cid:173)titude of quote-If President Ford wants him, we should support him-unquote. This set of blinders on my Republican friends led our party to near disaster in the sordid Watergate affair and should not be repeated here as a test of loyalty. At a time the American people are weary of politics, polticians, and pas.t failures of both parties, we should be holding out some bright new hope in this rare opportunity afforded by the 25th amendment. There is no hope for change in a Nelson Rockefeller. He represents the type of spending and taxing politi(cid:173)cian we should have had enough of. A legislative paralysis has precluded a real study of the nominee. It is one of the reasons for the decline in respect for this great body. I urge a \"No\" vote. Many issues liave never really been studied. One issue is the military draft. Nelson Rockefeller was No. 10 on his lo(cid:173)cal draft board but was appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt to a newly created Government post. Was the draft just one more thing that applied to average Americans but not to Nelson Rockefeller? Another issue that has received little attention is Rockefeller and Chase Man(cid:173)hattan Bank involvement in the World Trade Center in New York City. The New York State government is paying $16 mil(cid:173)lion a year in rent for space in that building while other previously built State buildings are sitting partially or totally empty. Is there a confiict of in(cid:173)terest in this matter? I do not know but the possibility has not been investigated. A third area where numerous ques(cid:173)tions remain is the case of L. Judson Morhouse. Senator HELMS has pointed out a' number of inconsistencies and dis(cid:173)crepancies in this whole case and in how Nelson Rockefeller related it. Has Nel(cid:173)son\u00b7 Rockefeller candidly related the Morhouse story? Has this issue been dealt with fully and accurately? Another area deals with American sov(cid:173)ereignty and vital American interests. His views on American participation in ",

            "604": "41622 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE December 20, 197 4 is been noted in programs where the defend(cid:173)ant's alleged criminality related to a specific social problem such as prostitution or heroin addiction. Of course, in the ab(cid:173)sence ot a .provision allowing the tolling of the speedy trial time limits, prosecutors would never agree to such diversion programs. Without such a provision the defendant could automatically obtain a dismissal of charges if prosecution were held in abey(cid:173)ance for a period of time in excess of the time limits set out in section 3161 (b) and (c). This section of S. 754 differs from its counterpart in S. 895. It now requires that exclusion for diversion only be allowed where deferral of prosecution is conducted \"with approval of the court.\" This assures that the court will be in(cid:173)volved in the decision to divert and that the procedure wlll not be used by prosecu(cid:173)tors and defense counsel to avoid the speedy trial time limits. Absence or Unavallablllty Subparagraph 3161 (h) (3) provides for ex(cid:173)clusion of time during which the defendant or an essential witness is absent or un(cid:173)available. Therefore, a fugitive defendant with an outstanding indictment cannot deduct from his 60 days the time during which he avoids prosecution. At the sugges(cid:173)tion of Senator Thurmond and Mr. Reznook, S. 754 was drafted so that it follows the language of the American Bar Association Speedy Trial Standards in defining the terms \"absence\" and \"unavailability.\" Fur(cid:173)thermore, the term \"unavailable\" means that if the defendant is located in another jurisdiction and ls not res~ting extradition and the attorney for the Government has exercised due dlllgence, the reasonable de(cid:173)lay related to the administrative operation the extradition system would also be excluded. This subsection has been amended by the Committee to include the absence of an essential witness, as well as the absence of the defendant, as one of the periods of delay wthich are exempted from the time limits. The necessity of including essential witnesses in this exclusion was pointed out by testi(cid:173)mony of the Justice Department before the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. The subsection as now constructed would remedy the situation in which an essential government witness becomes unavailable on the 59th day after indictment. Under the provisions contained in S. 754 as introduced, the case would be dismissed on the 60th day. This problem is especially acute when expert witnesses are involved because their presence is often required in different courts on the same day. This problem is resolved by the subsection 1n that an \"absent\" or \"unavailable\" witness 1s treated in the same manner as an \"absent\" or \"unavailable\" defendant. By an \"essential witness\" the Committee means a wl<tness so essentiai to the proceeding that continua(cid:173)tion without the witness would either be impossible or would likely result in a mis(cid:173)carriage of justice. For example, a chemist who has identified narcotics in the defend(cid:173)ant's possession would be an \"essential wit(cid:173)ness\" within the meaning of this subsection. ot Mental Incompetence Hearings Subparagraph 3161 (h) ( 4) of the b111 as reported deals with the exclusion of periods of time during which the defendant ls men(cid:173)tally incompete\u00b7nt to stand trial. Re\u00b7ference is made to the exclusion of periods of time relating to examination for mental incom(cid:173)petency in subparagraph 3161 (h) (1) (A) as a \"proceeding concerning the defendant\". That provision provides for the exclusion of time consumed in competency hearings and a rea(cid:173)sonable number of hospital days actually consumed by physicians in mental examina(cid:173)tion. However, once the defendant is deter(cid:173)mined incompetent the only consideration 1s his return to competency. The length of time required for him to do so obviously should not be the basis of a speedy trial claim under the bill. Therefore, a separate exclusion has been added to subsection 3161 (h). Narcotic Addict Rehabmtation Act Proceedings Subparagraph 3161(h)(5) of s. 754 deals with the exclusion of periods of time during which the defendant is under examination or treatment pending trial pursuant to the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966 (NARA). Reference ls made to the exclusion of periods of time relating to examination for addiction pursuant to NARA in subpara(cid:173)graph 3161(h) (1) (A) as a \"proceeding con(cid:173)cerning the defendant.\" That provision pro(cid:173)vides for the exclusion of time actually con(cid:173)sumed in hearings on the issue of addiction and a reasonable number of hospital days actually consumed by physicians in physical examination. However, once the defendant is determined to be an addict and falls within the eligib111ty provision of NARA, he is cov(cid:173)ered by that act and speedy trial ls much less relevant. Therefore a separate exclusion has been added to subsection 3161(h). Reindlctment After Dismissal Subparagraph 3161 (h) (6) provides for the case where the Government decides for one reason or another to dismiss charges on its own motion and to then recommence prose(cid:173)cution. Under this provision only the period of time during which the prosecution has actually been halted ls excluded from the 60-day time limits. Therefore, under 3161(h) (6) when the Government dismisses charges only the time between when the Government dis(cid:173)misses charges to when it reindicts is ex(cid:173)cluded from the 60-day time limits. For ex(cid:173)ample, 1f the Government decides 50 days after indictment to dismiss charges against the defendant then waits six months and reindlcts the defendant for the same offense the Government only has 10 days in which to be ready for trial. Joinder of Codefendants Subparagraph 3161 (h) (7) provides for the exclusion of time from the time limits where the defendant is joined for trial with a co(cid:173)defendant who was arrested or indicted after the defendant. The purpose of the provision ls to make sure that S. 754 does not alter the present rules on severence of codefend(cid:173)ants by forcing the Government to prosecute the first defendant separately or to be sub(cid:173)ject to a speedy trial dismissal motion under section 3162. The committee amended this provision, which appeared as 3161(c) (5) in the bill as introduced, to make it absolutely clear that Congress did not intend to alter the tradi(cid:173)tional rules of severance. According to the Justice Department, the original provision would have required the Government to show good cause for not granting a severance. This is contrary to present law which places the burden on the defendant who seeks the sev(cid:173)erance. The new provision deletes any refer(cid:173)ence to burdens of proof or \"good cause\" and simply refers to codefendants as to whom \"no motion for severance has been granted.\" \"Ends of Justice\" Continuance Subparagraph 3161 (h) (8) ls the heart of the speedy trial scheme created by S. 754. It allows for the necessary flexibll1ty to make 90 day trials a realistic goal within seven years of enactment. The provision represents considerable re(cid:173)vision by the committee. The original provi(cid:173)sions of S. 895 dealing With general contin(cid:173)uances, set a dual standard for continu(cid:173)ances---in some cases continuances would have been permitted for \"good cause\" and in some cases to meet the \"ends of justice.\" The original provisions also only allowed seven day continuances for \"good cause.\" The Department of Justice as well as many other commentators and witnesses found the provisions unnecessarily complicated and confusing. Therefore the committee consoli(cid:173)dated all of the continuance provisions into one provision, 3161(h) (8) of the bill as re(cid:173)ported. The new provision eliminates the words \"good cause\" and simply adopts the stiffer \"ends of justice\" standard-a. standard which was used in the original b111 for those situa(cid:173)tions which could not fall within the \"good cause\" continuance provisions. \"Ends of jws(cid:173)tice\" is the standard found in section 3651 of title 18 of the United States Code in refer(cid:173)ence to suspension of sentence and the grant(cid:173)ing of probation. In essence, the new pro(cid:173)vision allows a judge to grant a continuance only where he finds the \"ends of justice\" outweigh the best interest of the public and the best interest of the defendant in speedy trial. This means that in each case where a continuance is requested, and the factual situation does not fall within 3161(h) (1) through (7), the judge must determine be(cid:173)fore granting the continuance that society's interest in meeting the \"ends of justice\" out(cid:173)weighs the interest of the defendant and of society in achieving speedy trial. Further(cid:173)more the judge must set out in writing his reasons for believing that in granting the continuance he strikes the proper balance between these two societal interests. Although it is intended that continuances under 3161 (h) (8) should be given only in unusual cases, it is anticipated that the pro(cid:173)vision will be necessary in many protracted and complicated Federal prosecutions, that ls antitrust cases, and complicated organized crime conspiracy cases. However, the Com(cid:173)mittee has rejected a blanket exception for these cases and opted for a case-by-case approach (see p. 44). Each time such a con(cid:173)tinuance ls granted in a complicated case the judge wm still have to weigh the right of society and the defendant to a speedy trial against the \"ends of justice.\" For example, although a case like the alleged conspiracy involving the so-called \"Watergate case\" might normally be subject to a continuance under this provision because of its complex(cid:173)ity, society's interest in a speedy trial in ligl:tt of the then upcoming election might have outweighed that consideration. Of course, another option open to the judge in that case, were S. 754 the law, would have been to sever the burglary charges from the con(cid:173)spiracy case, and of course a continuance would not have been appropriate in the sim(cid:173)ple burglary case. The original \"ends of justice\" proviSlion contained in S. 754 was vague even when con(cid:173)strued in light of the accompanying legis(cid:173)lative hiistory. Therefore, upon the sugges(cid:173)tion of Senators Hruska and McClellan and the Justice Department, subsection 3161 (h) ( 8) has been redrafted to reflect the Commit(cid:173)tee's clear intention that the determina.t1on of whether or not to grant .an exclusion ls to be Vii'a a balancing test. Before establishing a special, more lenient set of limits, a. court would have to determine that the \"ends of justice\" outweigh the defendant's and so(cid:173)ciety's interest in speedy trial. Also, the sec(cid:173)tion as amended by the Committee sets out, in the statutory language, the specific fac(cid:173)tors which a judge should consider when weighing these interests. 'Ibis is designed to give the courts the maxlmum degree of guid(cid:173)ance in interpreting this critical provision. The new provision suggests three factors judge may consider in determining whether to grant a request for a special set of limits. First, ~t would be appropriate if the judge determines that failure to do so would make \"continuation of such proceed(cid:173)ing impossible, or result 11n a miscarriage of justice\". For example, the following circum(cid:173)stances would be sufficient to warrant the granting of an \"ends of justice\" extension: where the judge trying the case, the attor(cid:173)ney for the Government, defense counsel, the defendant or \u00b7an essential witness is 111 or un(cid:173)aible to continue, or the defense counsel has been permitted by the court to resign from wh~ch a ",

Membership on these subcommittees also permits me to serve on the conference committees which re(cid:173)solve appropriation differences between House and Senate bills, and which have much to do with the substance of these bills as they are signed into law. Com(cid:173)mittee work is demanding, but in my judgment the time is well spent. All of my committee assignments, especially the work of the Appropriations Com(cid:173)mittee, give me a chance to look out for the interests of Mississippians in the for(cid:173)mulation of national programs, I am pleased to have the opportunity to serve on these committees. CONCLUSION The year 1974 has been one of crisis-(cid:173)in our national domestic affairs, in the economic situation of our Nation and of the world, and in certain international tensions between various nations. We can be proud, however, at the way the United States has responded. Our con(cid:173)stitutional processes stood up under what has perhaps been the most severe test in our history. Our people and our Govern(cid:173)ment have joined in a realistic appraisal of the Nation's economic situation and the actions and sacrifices that are going to be necessary to stabilize the economy and slow inflation. Our problems are not as great as those of most industrial na(cid:173)tions of the world, but they are going to require unity and determination to over(cid:173)come them. I believe we can rise to this crisis, as we have to so many over the 200 years of our history. We must be greateful for what we have---that we are strong nation, that we are unified, and that we are at peace. There is much work ahead in 1975. I dedicate myself to it, strengthened by the trust and confidence extended to me by the people of Mississippi. I am grate(cid:173)ful to you for your loyalty. I look for(cid:173)ward to receiving your suggestions and constructive criticism, and to doing my utmost on your behalf. a THE SPECIAL TRADE REPRESENTATIVE Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I heard some views which I hope is not true. If so, it dismays me very much. I believe it my duty to report it, because the re(cid:173)ports I hear seem to be sufficiently ac(cid:173)curate that it would be worth discussing. It seems that the Special Trade Rep(cid:173)resentative, Mr. William Eberle, who worked diligently and zealously to pass the trade bill, has been given notice that he is fired as of next week. Mr. President, apparently the reason this happened was that the senior Sena(cid:173)tor from Louisiana <Mr. LONG) offered an amendment to the trade bill to pro(cid:173)vide that the Special Trade Representa(cid:173)tive should have the pay of the cabinet level. The amendment was entirely my idea, and I believe in it 100 percent, that -position, being very important and more 'Significant than some of the cabinet po(cid:173)sitions, in my judgment. Mr. President, I think I know some(cid:173)thing about what the pay of a job should be. When we established the pay for all those jobs about 26 years ago I was the manager of the top pay bill. I recall all the jealousies and the various quarrels about who should be paid more than who because it might affect the dignity of their jobs. I suppose that the Senator from Louisiana, as well as each legisla(cid:173)tor, could understand the problems in(cid:173)volved in saying whether someone should receive cabinet level pay or someone should receive lower level pay. It was also my feeling that the people who would be working the next level below the Special Trade Representative ought to be at the ambassadorial level because they would be dealing with am(cid:173)bassadors from other nations in negoti(cid:173)ating the trade agreements. Mr. President, I was aware that Mr. Roy Ash, the director of OMB, did not like this. Mr. Bill Simon, the Secretary of the Treasury, did not like this. But I did what I thought was right, and the Committee on Finance thought I was right, and the House conferees thought I was right. That is why that is in the law. Mr. Eberle followed the orders of his bosses repeatedly, stating to us that he was not for the amendment, he was not asking for it, he did not seek it, he did not want it, but at the same time, as a good soldier seeking to pass a piece of legislation for this administration, Mr. Eberle expected to live with a number of amendments that he was not advocating in order to get for this administration what it was seeking. It may be that President Ford, Mr. Si(cid:173)mon, Mr. Ash, Mr. Dent, and Mr. Kis(cid:173)singer might feel that Mr. Eberle was campaigning for a raise. He was not. That man is serving at a financial sacri(cid:173)fice even if he does receive Cabinet level pay. But, Mr. President, the Special Trade Representative is working for Congress as much as he is working for the President. It is different from the average Cabinet officer. The Special Trade Representative is serving in a somewhat unusual capacity. The power to regulate foreign trade, to fix tariffs and quotas, and to deal with unfair trade practices is in the Congress. This function is not in the executive branch. The only way that the executive branch gets into it is that the President has appointing authority and we usually call upon the President to make the ap(cid:173)pointment. Under the Constitution the appointing authority is not in the Con(cid:173)gress and the question would then be: Who makes the appointment unless the Congress is to make the appointment? We have 100 Senators and 435 Congress(cid:173)men. That is really all the President has to do with the job of Special Trade Repre(cid:173)sentative. He is not supposed to be a flunky for the President. This Senator more or less resented the idea that a White House aide, like Mr. Flanigan, or a Director of OMB, or a second or third level echelon adminis\u00b7tration person, would feel that he could order around, and give commands to, someone who, in the last analysis, was an agent of the Congress. All the President did was to appoint him. At least, that is how I looked upon it under my theory of this organization. I will be disappointed, Mr. President, if Mr. Eberle is to be dismissed because he is suspected of failing to do everything he could to keep his job from having the dignity which the Congress thought it should have. The fact is he did, in my judgment, exactly what he should have done. He said he was not supporting it, he was not asking for it, he did not ex(cid:173)pect it, and he wanted it known that the administration was opposed to the eleva(cid:173)tion of the position. If that is to be done, Mr. President, we expect to take a very good look at who(cid:173)ever the President sends down here to replace Mr. Eberle. We expect to look at his credentials very carefully, very thoroughly, and we may want to amend that law before we confirm that man as special trade repre(cid:173)sentative, to make it clear that man is not working for the President; he is working for the Congress. This is an authority and a power that is put in the Congress under the Consti(cid:173)tution. We have delegated that to the President, but not so somebody in the State Department could command the man around, especially some second or third-level functionary over there, and not so somebody in the Treasury Depart(cid:173)ment could command the man around, and not so someone in the White House(cid:173)a Mr. Flanigan or a Mr. Ash, or whoever it might be, some of them unknown to me and unknown to the Congress in gen(cid:173)eral--could command a man who, in the last analysis, was supposed to be repre(cid:173)senting us. As I say, Mr. President, if that is how it is to be it is a very grave disappoint(cid:173)ment to this Senator, and I believe it will be to the Congress. I regret to say I fear it would put the President's negotiations off on a very poor start if, when the Senate and the House felt the job should have that dignity, a man who served in a very fine fashion, and for whom we came to complete respect, confidence, and admiration, were to be fired for the reason that we thought enough of the position and not enough of the man that we thought the job com(cid:173)manded the higher pay. I have seen many things happen in Government about which I have been dis(cid:173)appointed, sometimes things that caused me to think less of some people. But I must say, Mr. President, that this would be an extreme case in that regard. The President can do what he wants to do about the matter. I should like to remind the President, Mr. Simon, Mr. Ash, and that group that not all the power exists in the executive branch. Some of it exists here.

Some of this aid can go to assist the youth of Portugal. The Universities are still for(cid:173)mally closed; but education continues in informal classes and in the homes of profes(cid:173)sors. 15,000 Portuguese students lack proper classrooms; and countless more lack the books and libraries they need for liberal edu(cid:173)cation. After nearly half-a-century of repres(cid:173)sive rule, these students must have the tools of education. These are the tools that can bring the ideas of Western education and democracy to a population starved of free thought and free expression for more than three generations. Let it not be said that Portugal's experi(cid:173)ment was jeopardized because the United States did not support efforts by Portuguese democrats to follow the ideals we have ex(cid:173)pressed for more than two centuries. Here, too, we must understand new forces in the outside world, and new commitments that go beyond the politics and preoccupations of the past. HUMAN RIGHTS Our responsibilities towards Portugal re(cid:173)flect our need to reassert traditional Ameri(cid:173)can concern for human rights-so often neglected in recent years. This means limit(cid:173)ing the power of the CIA, so that never again will we bear the strain of thwarting the will of a people, or of helping to bring down an elected government. Professor Plank has been particularly courageous in opposing what we did in Chile-and his inspiration must light the way for American actions. Concern for human rights means a vigor(cid:173)ous American effort in Cyprus, to help the refugees and move the parties towards agree(cid:173)ment and the restoration of the sovereignty and integrity of that troubled island. Concern for human rights means meeting our shared responsibilities for feeding man(cid:173)kind, for aiding efforts to limit population growth, to further education and human development, and to save lives wasted by disease. But most important, concern for human rights means recognizing the enduring, basic importance of each man and woman. It means tempering the demands of power with compassion. And it means accepting that the worth of the United States in the world will finally be measured by our willingness to hear and heed the cries of the oppressed, the weak, and the poor. RELATING FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC POLrrICS There is one further lesson about America's relations with the outside world that I bring home from my trip to Europe and the Middle East. It is that the demands of foreign policy and those of domestic policy are now inter(cid:173)twined as never before. We can no longer talk of foreign policy as an arena subject far removed from the lives of individual Americans-far removed from this univer(cid:173)sity campus. There is now growing conflict between many demands of our domestic economy, and the demands of international economic life-conflicts that we face every day on Capitol Hill. What are these conflicts? Many Americans want to limit exports of food in order to keep prices down-but we must also export food to pay for oil imports, and to meet commitments to nations that must import food to live. We want to protect American workers against unfair foreign competition-but we must also beware of setting off a wave of retallation that could bring on worldwide depression. We want to help solve inflation by import(cid:173)ing more goods from abroad-but we must also pay our way in the world, and beware of exporting our inflation. We want to encourage some on-country investments in the United States-but we must also be concerned with the impact these investments will have on our domestic econ(cid:173)omy, and on the needs of other nations. The Congress-against my opposition(cid:173)voted to require that a major share of our oil imports are carried in U.S. ships-but we must also face potential retaliation from other countries, and a loss of confidence in U.S. lead.ership. And some Americans want to reduce our role in helping the world's developing coun(cid:173)tries-but if we do so, we must also face the rise of human tragedy in those same coun(cid:173)tries, and the defeat of efforts to secure their cooperation on oil and other raw materials. These and other daily conflicts between foreign and domestic policy must be resolved. But that cannot be done by a Secretary of State, or Commerce, or the Treasury-how(cid:173)ever able, experienced, and wise these people may be. None of them has the scope in his responsibilities for fitting all the pieces of the international puzzle together. More im(cid:173)portant, none of them can combine factors of domestic and international life, and make the hard decisions about competing demands. As I have learned from my years in Wash(cid:173)ington, these choices cannot be made with(cid:173)out effective, committed leadership from the President-working with Congress and with the American people, themselves. Within the Administration, only he has the purview and the political mandate to weave together the strands of domestic and foreign economic policy. Only he can bring to the American people the tough choices that we must face, and seek our participation in the difficult process. We can and must take part, making our constructive suggestions and understanding the impact of the outside world on our dally lives. For this is the final and most critical lesson that I bring home from Europe and the Middle East: that the basic decisions about America's future in the outside world must be made right here, in the cities and towns of America. You, too, as university students, are vitally involved. This is your nation(cid:173)your future-your responsibility. I have no doubt that you and other young Americans will be equal to this challenge-to this op(cid:173)portunity for helping to build America and a more peaceful, just and humane world for all mankind. POLL: MAJORITY AGAINST CPA-ACA BILL Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, an interest(cid:173)ing article from the New York City En(cid:173)quirer of October 17, has just come to my attention. This publication evidently set forth the pro and con arguments on the now mori(cid:173)bund Agency for Consumer Advocacy(cid:173)alias Consumer Protection Agency-bill, by two very able advocates, the distin(cid:173)guished Senators from Connecticut <Mr. RIBICOFF) and New York (Mr. BUCKLEY). A poll of its readership was apparently then taken on the subject. The result vindicates what was said about this bill, S. 707, in our minority' views. Namely, that the ACA is a bad idea whose time has come and gone. A ma(cid:173)jority of this publication's readership is opposed to this concept. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con(cid:173)sent that this article be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: RESULTS OF ENQUmER READER PoLL-F'IFTY(cid:173)THREE PERCENT AGAINST FEDERAL CONSUMER AGENCY A federal Consumer Protection Agency is not needed. say a narrow majority of readers responding to an Enquirer opinion poll. Latest results of the poll, which appeared in our Sept. 15 issue, show that of 957 bal(cid:173)lots cast, 513, or 53.6 percent, were \"no\" votes to the question: \"Does the U.S. need a Con(cid:173)sumer Protection Agency?\" The remaining 444 ballots, or 46.4 percent, were \"yes\" votes. The Enquirer takes no sides in its opin(cid:173)ion polls. But we do present the opposing viewpoints of authorities. U.S. Sen.

Mr. President, I have read with interest the recent speech by Congressman DAVID R. OBEY before the Society for Occupational and Environ(cid:173)mental Health. Congressman OBEY, in his role as a member of the House Labor(cid:173)HEW Appropriations Subcommittee, a knowledgeable and active supporter of worker rights to an occupational en(cid:173)vironment free from hazardous exposure toxic or pathogenic chemicals. The administration has never adequately funded or staffed the Government's pro(cid:173)grams for research on occupational car(cid:173)cinogens or other potentially hazardous industrially used substances, and yet seemingly every week we hear that an(cid:173)other chemical is causing illness or death among our working men and women. is going to fall the Congress again to insist, through its oversight and legislative functions, that the workers, entitlement to a safe and healthful workplace be upheld. I recommend this speech for the reading of the Members of this body, and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: It to ADDRESS OF C'ONGRESSMAN DAVID R. OBEY BEFORE THE SOCIETY FOR OCCUPATIONAL & ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH, WASHINGTON, D.C. rrhank you for inviting me here today. I want~d to come because you are an im(cid:173)portant group of people and you are dealing with an important problem. What bothers m~ very much is that not many people know it. You are dealing with-and investigaiting(cid:173)many facets of one simple fact: That the hu(cid:173)man organism is being silently and subtly bombarded with an exploding variety of en(cid:173)vironmental changes-most of them syn(cid:173)thetic and largely untested, which may have serious long-term physical consequences for all of us. Oh, I know that many Americans are vaguely aware that smog causes health prob(cid:173)lems, that there may be some health problem with asbestos. Some of them have just last month noticed reports about potential car(cid:173)cinogens being found in some communities' water supply. More have probably heard about some vague problem being associated with vinyl chloride. But mostly these bits of information are-to most Americans-a se(cid:173)ries o!f unrelated messages, of uncertain im(cid:173)portance. The problem is that you know, but most of them don't: That the mortality rate for men 1n this country has actually been increasing for over ten years now; That a steadily Increasing portion of Americans of all ages, of both sexes-those ",

            "854": "41872 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE December 20, 1974 the facts of his accomplish(cid:173)far with ments. As a senior Member of the House, he served throughout the 1960's as chair(cid:173)man of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, before assuming the position he holds today as chairman of the Govern(cid:173)ment Operations Committee. In his cur(cid:173)rent capacity he monitors Federal ex(cid:173)penditures with the object of insuring their compliance with congressional in(cid:173)tent; and no one, to my knowledge, could handle that supreme authority with greater skill nor greater certainty than he. In his former position with the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, CHET HOLIFIELD was required to deal with awe(cid:173)some national security problems, which he did with great skill and expertise. Also concerned for the public health, as well as for the national security, he was re(cid:173)sponsible in 1957 for investigations into the hazardous effects of radiation on hu(cid:173)man life, with the object of imposing stronger safety standards in the produc(cid:173)tion of nuclear devices. He has been in the forefront on every piece of legislation affecting the well(cid:173)being of every American for the past 30 years. He has been a devoted and dedi(cid:173)cated public servant contributing his tal(cid:173)ents in drafting some of the finest legis(cid:173)lation ever enacted in the area of consumer protection. The record of Cli:ET HOLIFIELD is one of outstanding performance and out(cid:173)standing recognition. On all problems of importance he has responded with the alacrity of a man who is the willing servant of public duty, and always with that same resourcefulness which never seems to fail him. He has served his district and his country with equal intensity and devo(cid:173)tion, and his record is one of hard work and deep concern. Mrs. Annunzio joins me in extending our sincerest best wishes to CHET and to his lovely wife, and we wish for them continued good health and many, many more fruitful years during their retire(cid:173)ment. I am sorry to see him leave and he will be missed in his House-the House of Representatives. Mr. VEYSEY. Mr. Speaker, before I came to the Congress in 1970, I had learned to know and respect CHET HOLI(cid:173)FIELD as one of California's most capable Congressmen. During my tenure in the state assembly, we found numerous oc(cid:173)casions to seek his assistance, and he graciously and willingly responded to our requests. Now after 32 years CHET HOLIFIELD has decided to step aside. During his tenure in the House of Representatives, many Federal programs have been shaped by his extensive activities to improve Gov(cid:173)ernment and make it more responsive to the people. As chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy he has played an active role in developing en(cid:173)ergy legislation. His position on Govern(cid:173)ment procurement is well documented. He served as chairman of a blue ribbon panel in 1969 seeking ways to improve Federal procurement procedures. His ef(cid:173)forts to eliminate waste and duplication are seemingly endless. As chairman of the Committee on Gov(cid:173)ernment Operations, he has fought a continuing war against the evergrowing burden of paperwork in Federal agencies. In fact, he sponsored a bill to require an authoritative study to identify means to reduce the volume of paperwork. The House has already enacted the measure, and it has been referred to a Senate committee. He was one of the first to champion environmental legislation, and during his entire career, he has supported more than 200 environmental and conserva(cid:173)tion laws. As dean of the California dele(cid:173)gation he was in a unique position to guide significant legislation through guidance, the laws to combat California's air and water pollution problems likely would not have been approved by the Congress during the late 1960's. The outstanding characteristics of Congressman HoLIFIELD's career are hard work, dedication, integrity, and leader(cid:173)ship. His absence will leave a void in the ranks of the California delegation as well as in the House. His un:fiagging in(cid:173)terest and dedication to public service will be sorely missed in the coming years. We commend him for an outstanding job, and we trust that he will enjoy the same degree of success in retirement as\\ he pursues personal goals. In addition, our best wishes go to Cam, the lovable and dedicated wife of CHET HOLIFIELD. She has served so capably as the \"first lady\" of the California delegS1tion, and we all love and respect her. Mr. BROOKS. Mr. Speaker, for the past 22 years I have had the very great and distinct pleasure of serving on the Government Operations Committee with our distinguished chairman, CHET HOLI(cid:173)FIELD. Although many Members of Con(cid:173)gress have served long and outstanding careers, few have risen to such a high position of respect and esteem among fell ow Members as CHET HOLIFIELD. Chairman HOLIFIELD's congressional career spans one of the most exciting periods in our history-in which our Na(cid:173)tion moved into the atomic age. Without question, CHET HOLIFIELD will be remem(cid:173)bered as the Congressman who did more for the peaceful use of nuclear energy than any of his contemporaries. As a member of the Government Op(cid:173)erations Committee since its creation in 1949, Chairman HOLIFIELD has had a pro(cid:173)found impact on the structure of our National Government. The establish(cid:173)ment of three of our major Depart(cid:173)ments of Government-HEW, HUD, and DOT-reflect his creative leadership. His work as chairman of the Government Operations Committee has greatly en(cid:173)riched our national history and will con(cid:173)tinue to be felt throughout the Federal Government for years to come. In his 32 years of service in the U.S. House of Representatives, CHET HoLI(cid:173)FIELD has set a high standard of achieve(cid:173)ment and excellence for our country. He has worked hard at building a moral en(cid:173)vironment in which man's full potential can be realized in dignity and honor. He is recognized throughout our Nation for his compassion and understanding. His public and private acts always reflect good government, good citizenship and human brotherhood. ts in I can understand why, after 32 years~ he now chooses to take a little time for himself and his family. He has earned it. So has his lovely wife, cam, who has been so helpful to him throughout his distinguished career. When CHET HOLIFmLD retires at the end of this session, I will greatly miss his presence in the Congress and on the Government Operations Committee. He is a great American and I deeply value his warm friendship, his wise counsel, and his intense dedication to better government. Mr. ANDERSON of California. Mr. Speaker, a giant of the Congress, indeed the Nation, has decided to leave public service and enter a well-deserved retire(cid:173)ment. Congressman CHET HOLIFIELD, the chairman of the Government Operations Committee, the chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, and the dean of the California delegation, stepping down after 32 years of dedi(cid:173)cated and devoted service to this Nation. And over those years, the list of achieve(cid:173)ments is virtually endless-but at the top of the list, one would have to place his efforts toward the peaceful use of nu(cid:173)clear energy, and his leadership modernizing the Government. Not only has CHET HOLIFIELD been a national leader, he has been an inter(cid:173)national leader, recognized around the world as an expert on nuclear energy. Since 1955, he has served\u00b7 on the U.S. Delegation to the International Confer(cid:173)ence on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic En(cid:173)ergy. At international conferences held from 1957 through 1970, he has been in(cid:173)strumental in efforts to use nuclear power in a safe, efficient method for the good of mankind. In the Congress, his leadership on the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy has led to many Sidvances in the field of en(cid:173)ergy derived from atomic power. And these Sidvances could effectively serve the energy needs of future generations. In addition, as the chairman of the Government Operations Committee, CHET has worked for an efficient, respon(cid:173)sive Government that meets the needs of the people it serves. As a businessman, engaged in the manufacture and selling of men's apparel, CHET has used these commonsense business techniques to bring economy to the Government. Mr. Speaker, this Congress will not be the same without CHET HOLIFIELD, and the kind of caliber he brought to the Nation will be missed. Mrs. Anderson joins me in wishing CHET and his lovely wife Cam the very best in their retirement, and we hope that they will continue to be active in the community, sharing their years of experience with a grateful Nation. Mr. CEDERBERG. Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to imagine a session of Congress without our friend and colleague, CHET HOLIFIELD. In this political arena where new faces and names are a way of life every 2 years, CHET HOLIFIELD'S familiar face had become a welcomed and ac(cid:173)cepted fixture. The examples of his distinguished serv(cid:173)ice are so numerous that it is impossible to do justice to his outstanding 32-year congressional career. He has made enor-",

In January, 1972, a New York County grand jury reported that this was ad(cid:173)ministered \"in an incredibly chaotic man(cid:173)ner\" and just two years later, the then State Welfare Inspector General, Gorge F. Berlinger, charged that more than. $1-billion had been paid to such purveyors with virtually no veri(cid:173)fication. He estimated that 30 percent of such bills were overcharges or fictitious charges for 1:1erices not rendered. Many inspectors say that some of the loot filters back to operators of nursing homes. Two medical technicians who asked not to be identified said they had been told by one Brooklyn owner that they did not actually have to perform the tests for which they would hill Medicaid. A kickback was implied. A state inspector reported that one lot of X-rays taken in a nursing home by a. thriving radiology firm turned out to 'be Uleglble. An(cid:173)other recalled such phenomena as 244 b1lls for foot treatments at 1a home with 245 pa(cid:173)tients. Complaints to the authorities frequently allege that patients do not receive rthe $28.50 a month of personal spending money allowed them by Social Security. Especially with the senile, It ts common for nursing-home administrators to cash Social Security checks for patients. The Liberty House Nursing Home in Brooklyn, which was closed la.st year e.r.ter being described as \"a shocking horror,\" was alleged to have withheld $46,750 in such funds. Illegal extra charges for laundry and other services paid for by Medicaid a.re reiported to be common, and in many homes the patients are expected to tip for help in the bath. Nepotism is a traditional and often legal way of improving earnings. Families a.re em(cid:173)ployed throughout the business, often in one another's homes, and the salaries add up. An official cited one home on Sta.ten Isls.nd, where one partner gets $26,000 as administra(cid:173)tor and another $32,000 as purchasing agent, with no visible qualification for the job. The maverick operator said administrators sometimes bought \u00b7their jobs, and recovered the purchase price from llle151Sl charges for services, tips from \u00b7concerned relatives of pa(cid:173)tients, 1and moonlighting. A problem for inspectors is that adminis(cid:173)trators and other key employes are often not around when they call. This is in fact given as an explanation for the long-standing policy of giving operators several weeks' no(cid:173)tice of inspections. A employe active in a union of nursing(cid:173)home workers said a clean-up usually was ordered the day before inspection. A state official agreed and added that often staff would be expanded then to meet require(cid:173)ments. But he added that the inspections nevertheless did improve conditions, at least for the time being. LENGTHY LITIGATION \"We go on the assumption thia.t nursing homes have rights, as well as individuals,\" said Alan Saperstein, a Federal overseer for Medicaid in this region. \"We give the Institu(cid:173)tions a fair chance to con-ect their deficien(cid:173)cies. Further, nursing homes have veTy good counsel.\" A state official said it would take three to five of Utigation to close down a home that was a flagrant viola.tor. This has seldom hap(cid:173)pened, even where criminal fraud was alleged, life for many patients, with handicraft and social programs. Under state regulation, most have therapy programs. Television and tran(cid:173)quilizers, however, appear to be the most used forms of care. A -Queens physician, defending the quality of nursin~ homes, said that many patients are senile and not at all subjects for social programs. Many, however, are alert when they enter the homes and do respond to the cli(cid:173)mate of the institution, according to other observers. \"Nur.sing homes are not primarily a place for rehabilitation,\" the physician said, \"but rather storage bins for our old and Infirm . The patients are not there because unscru(cid:173)pulous nursing homes a.re out soliciting, but because we as people are only too willing to relieve ourselves of any burden, be they mother. father or uncle.\" [From the New York Times, Oct. 8, 1G74] NURSING HOMES USE A VARIETY OF FISCAL RUSES To LIFT PROFITS ABOVE THE PERCENT ALLOWED BY LAW 10 (By John L. Hess) For more than 20 years, local, state and Federal authorities have sought to limit the profits of nursing homes and to keep them in the hands of small and presumably dedi(cid:173)cated owners. Government agencies have had no more success in this than in eliminating the perennial scandals of neglect and fraud that the authorities say have stained the industry. New York State bars corporations from op(cid:173)erating nursing homes, but nearly all are owned by corporations and leased to opera(cid:173)tors, at least nominally-which makes the arrangement technically legal. More than 90 per cent of their income comes from Med(cid:173)icaid, which, under law, allows them only a.bout 10 per cent return on Investment. According to officials who monitor the op(cid:173)eration of the homes, blue-chip stocks go begging at earnings of 20 per cent and more, but a lively buyers' market exists in owner(cid:173)ships of nursing homes. This market, and other data, tend to confirm published esti(cid:173)mates that the true earnings may run from 20 to 40 per cent. INVESTORS EAGER The administrator of an independent nursing home in suburban New Jersey says he gets half a dozen letters a week from New York specialist brokers, importuning him to sell the place to one of their Investors. But shares may also be marketed in small part(cid:173)nerships, denoted In beds. During a two-month investigation by The New York Times, interviews with scores of witnesses and the records of a dozen govern(cid:173)ment agencies revealed how the extra profits are ma.de: by sales, leases and subleases to obtain higher rents and depreciation; by \u00b7 nepotism and payroll padding; by kickbacks from suppliers; by falsification of costs, and by the withholding from patients of services paid for by Medicaid. None of this is new. Only the numbers have changed, as support for the indigent aged patient passed in 1967 from local welfare departments to Medicaid. It paid $559-mll(cid:173)Uon to nursing homes In New York State alone last year. Two-thirds of this went to proprietary, or privately operated, homes and most of the rest to voluntary, or phllanthropic institu(cid:173)tions. The Federal government pays half the bill, and the state and localities each pay one-quarter. A perusal of files going back 20 years pro(cid:173)duces a. dreary litany of scandals, denunci(cid:173)ations and allegations, nearly all of which eventually faded with little result. ONE MAJOR INQUIRY In the late nineteen-fifties, for example, night raids by the C'ity Department of Inves(cid:173)tigations revealed that a number of homes had left their patients virtually abandoned: as in the King Manor chain still operating in Western New York. One reason, officials say, is that until re(cid:173)cently there was no place to send the pa(cid:173)tients. Following the Medicaid building 1boom, there are now some empty beds, and the state is no longer granting licenses for new projects in this airea. But it has been blocked for two years by court injunctions In its effort to close some of the scores of noncon(cid:173)forming homes. The courts have ruled that a. license to run a nursing home, once granted, is a property right that may not be removed without due . process\u00b7. Due process sometimes seems inter(cid:173)minaible in nursing home cases. In most legal proceedings, ea.ch side must pay its own costs, !8.lthough the winner may, in certain cases, recover from the loser. It does not work that way for the nursing-home industry. Medicaid pays the legal and auditing ex(cid:173)penses of nursing homes, and while no over(cid:173)all figures were available, a state auditor said that it would \u00b7be reasonable to estimate that the industry here paid its lawyers and ac(cid:173)counts $1-million a year. STATE HAS FEW AUDITORS Officials last year proposed to post a ce111ng on such expenditures and argued that when a nursing home was found at fault, the op(cid:173)erator should pay his own legal bills. But counsel for the State Department of Heal.th held that this woud be found a denial of due process. By contrast, the department's staff ls lim(cid:173)ited by a budget set by legislators, some of whom double as lay lawyers for the nursing(cid:173)home Industry. Like other trade associations and labor unions, the industry also con(cid:173)tributes to political campaign funds through political action committees and private donations. In a spot check of 58 nursing homes, state auditors recently found $4.6-million in over(cid:173)charges, ranging from phony bills to family ca.rs, tuition fees, vacation travel and even a yacht. But there are only 16 auditors and one full~time lawyer to cover reimbursement claims of 1,600 medical fac111ties in the staff. Their problem is aggravated by the in(cid:173)credible complexity of ownership patterns 1n the industry. According to a state official who has been studying the problem, the most sophisticated real-estate transactions and subcontracting deals are used to increase depreciation, conceal profits and avoid taxes. An effort to narrow these loopholes may be made at the next session of Legislature .. PLACEMENT OF PATIENTS A patient and acknowledged inequity In the cost-.plus system is the wide range of ca.re provided. 'r.heoretically, all Medicaid patients are equal. They are paupers, defined as hav(cid:173)ing no more than $1,600 in savings. But some go to $26-a-day hovels and some to relatively grand quarters at up to $75 a day. Operators said candidly that welfare offi(cid:173)cials send the dispossessed to the cheapest homes available. Costlier homes have waiting lists of more fortunate clients. In some cases, children, who are no longer legally obliged to support their parents, pay bribes to get them in. Often, such clients enter as private pa(cid:173)tients at premium rates and switch to Medic(cid:173)aid when their savings are exhausted. In the city, blacks occupy only 15 per cent of the beds, although they represent a much larger proportion of the poor. Among homes visited during this investigation, it appeared that the proportion of blacks declined as conditions improved, and two of the best(cid:173)equipped places seemed to have only one or two blacks each. But even the new and costly nursing homes arouse complaints of neglect. At one $46-a(cid:173)day home in Manhattan, a nurse said, \"They come in a little sick, and they go down, down.'' Neighborhood volunteers have brightened ",
            "954": "41972 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE lJecember 2u, 19 7 4 bureaucracy reluctant to enter a state with(cid:173)out authorization and the other with General Townsend. A typical skirmish in the latter battle broke out when Townsend refused to au(cid:173)thorize a request for stethoscopes and other sorely needed medical supplies. According to one person who saw the requisition order, the General scribbled in the margin: \"If they have to listen to a heart beat they can darn well go down on their knees and pull their ears to the patient's chest.\" Flood sent a.n Army truck to pick up the supplies anyway, only to have the National Guardsmen refuse to release them. The truck came back empty, and an incensed Flood put in a call to Gov(cid:173)ernor Shapp. An observer recalled his words: \"If you won't give us the supplies we'll blast the plaice open.\" The medical supplies were handed out. Another skirmish: on Wednesday the Gen(cid:173)eral ordered the National Guard troops out of the valley. On Friday Flood not only had them back but had arranged to have several companies of Army reservists reassigned to Wilkes-Barre for their summer training. And another: the General ordered a halt to the emergency federal food shipments that were being distributed to tens of thousands of flood victims at the local akport. A call from Flood, and the Department of Agriculture reinstated the shipments under the pretext of \"supporting the federal effort.\" And so the local battle with Townsend went. Meanwhile, on the federal level, Flood con(cid:173)tinued to perform like a circus impresario calling out one more remarkable act after another. On the second night o{ the flood, a fire started in downtown Wilkes-Barre and threatened to spread throughout the cen(cid:173)tral city. Burning office buildings were sur(cid:173)rounded by several feet of water, making it impossible for fire trucks to move in. This was the sort of challenge that seemed to delight Flood. Reasoning that the nearest analogy to his problem was a fire at sea, Flood located a Coast Guard fireboat in New Jersey and then found a C-130 transport i.n Boston. An Air Force general was awakened at 2: 00 A.M. by a strange, theatrical voice. After cracking sev(cid:173)eral jokes, Flood identified himself as \"the vice-chairman of defense appropriations. My spies tell me you have a C-130 on the line there.\" When the plane arrived in Wilkes-Barre with the fireboat, two flatbed trucks from the Tobyhanna Army Depot 3 rushed the boat to the flooded city, where it steamed off and put out the fire, just a few hours after it had begun. Flood was exhilarated. At sixty-eight he was working twenty-two hours a day and seemed to be getting stronger as he went along. Throughout the crisis he continued to dress extravagantly in purple and brown Edwardian suits, his moustache carefully waxed. Harried bureaucrats from assorted federal agencies, summoned to Wilkes-Barre by Flood, waited outside his \"command post\" to be received. \"Why, you must have crystal balls,\" Flood snapped at one official who had just given a detailed accounting of the damage. \"Those are the very questions I was going to ask you to look into.\" Flood listened for a mo(cid:173)ment more as the man launched into a new set of statistics. \"Okay, that's enough. Pull the curtain down.\" The man kept talking. \"Curtain down!\" Flood shouted. \"When an act's good, get out in time.\" s The Tobyhanna Army Depot was just a shooting range until Flood took an interest in the installation. The Army had decided to shut it down when the vice-chairman of defense appropriations persuaded the Penta(cid:173)gon to transform it into the principal East Coast base for overhauls of communications equipment. Enter another man from the General Serv(cid:173)ices Administration. When he flubbed his lines, Flood barked, \"I'm getting food flown here. I'm getting medicine and personnel. Now I want germicides from you. I want soap tonight!\" The tongue-tied GSA man mum(cid:173)bled a commitment as Flood waved him off the stage. \"That's it. Good show, enough for one show.\" The next official opened the door as Flood muttered: \"A bureaucrat's a bureaucrat until you do something about it.\" ARM-TW \u00b5;TING In a sense Flood had been rehearsing for his role in the Great Deluge ever since he entered Congress in 1944. In that year the Eleventh Congressional District was suffer(cid:173)ing an even greater disaster than the waters that would drown it twenty-eight years later. For decades, coal mining had been the sole industry in northeastern Pennsylvania, an area that holds the only major deposits of anthracite coal in the country. During World War I, more trains came into Wilkes-Barre than into any other city except Chicago. Each year 100,000 men tolled in the mines to pro(cid:173)duce 100 mlllion tons of coal for a seemingly limitless market. By the end of World War II, however, anthracite was no longer competi(cid:173)tive with bituminous coal, which is easier to mine, nor with liquid and gaseous fuels. To(cid:173)day, the demand for anthracite has all but disappeared save one loyal but increasingly reluctant customer, the U.S. Army. In 1960 Flood discovered that it was tech(cid:173)nica.llY possible to convert the U.S. Army's 8,000 coke-burning barracks furnaces in West Germany to anthracite use. Granted, anthra(cid:173)cite coal was not being used anywhere else in the world: it was expensive to buy, even more expensive to ship across the Atlantic from Wilkes-Barre, and particularly expen(cid:173)sive to hire more than 1,000 men needed to stoke the furnaces. Nevertheless, the furnaces were converted. By the late 1960s, even the Army began to flinch at the annual cost of the favor to Flood. Budget officials estimated that the Army could save over $20 million a year by reconverting the furnaces to oil. Moreover, there were no longer enough people willing to work in the Wilkes-Barre mines, and the companies were falling behind in their ship(cid:173)ments. They had even resorted to lobbying with immigration officials to let them import German miners. Year after year, the Army has attempted to get Congress to appropriate funds for the reconversion, and each year the proposal has died in the Defense Appropria(cid:173)tions Subcommittee, of which Dan Flood is vice-chairman. At lunch in the House dining room, Flood eagerly admitted to his role in the matter: \"Hell, yes, I stopped it.\" Other Congressmen seated at adjoining tables looked up with smiles. \"I did it by twisting arms and ham(cid:173)mering heads. I'd break a few arms if I had to.\" \"Why does the Army let you do it?\" Flood was asked. \"They can't be blamed,\" he said sym(cid:173)pathetically. \"After all, here's Flood, a nice fellow, and he's got a great reputation for being for defense appropriations-bang, bang, bang, and all that. Jesus Christ, sup(cid:173)pose you were one these goddamn generals or secretaries or deputy secretaries. What areyou going to do? Jeopar\u00a3).1ze the Army materiel command with a son of a bitch like that for a couple of million dollars, for a couple of tons of coal? ---.\" ' Flood is like a barroom civics teacher, de-\u2022 Last year, in the wake of the energy crisis, Flood managed to write Into law a measure prohibiting conversion of the fur(cid:173)naces. A despairing Army budget official re(cid:173)marked, \"Now he's made it so we could get put in jail for trying to convert those furnaces.\" lighting ln relating how he pressures the system to respond to his district's needs. \"It just so happens that I get a.long with most of the members of the subcommittee [Defense Appropriations] . I do a lot for them, and I'm also chairman of the Labor Health, Education, and Welfare Subcommittee. For the first time in history the HEW bill is bigger than Defense. Here I am, identified with three-fourths of the whole federal budget. You can imagine what that means. You get to be known, and while you don't threaten anyone-they are very understand(cid:173)ing people and very human-it's this sort of thing, you see. It's very technical and I use all of these opportunities, advantages, seniority, and all of this stuff for the purpose of helping whatever is left of the goddamn anthracite coal industry.\" Almost every year Jack Anderson devotes a column to \"Dapper Dan Flood.\" He writes of the 100 free flights Flood took on Con(cid:173)tinental Airlines when his law firm was put on the airline's retainer, or of the time Flood obtained a large defense contract for Medico Industries, which Anderson maintained had connections with the Mafia. One column charged Flood with pressuring HEW to award a $500,000 contract to an unqualified Wilkes(cid:173)Barre firm. Flood's approach to answering such charges is generally the same. \"That wasn't the first time I've twisted some arms for someone back home,\" he said. \"I've done it hundreds of times. In fact, I did it fifteen times today already.\" THE BENEVOLENT DICTATOR The Wyoming valley had been declared a federal disaster area once before, in the 1950s, when the death of the coal-mining industry had lifted the unemployment rate to 19 percent. There were no major roads into the district, the closest fully equipped hospital was in Philadelphia, and the area was split into twenty-two competing and inefficient municipalities. Yet by 1972 the valley had achieved a com(cid:173)plete recovery. When the floodwaters came in June, unemployment had dropped to the national average as a diversified industrial base offered more and more jobs and a hope(cid:173)ful future. There is no mystery behind the recovery. On every facet of it rests the signa(cid:173)ture of Dan Flood. On more than one occasion, truckers driv(cid:173)ing down Interstate 83 have been startled by the sudden appearance of a white Cadillac convertible bearing down on them. In it are Mr. and Mrs. Dan Flood, on their way to Wilkes-Barre. A parakeet called Tony is in a cage on the floor, Cocoa the dachshund sits on Mrs. Flood's lap, and a goldfish in a bowl rests between the Congressman's legs. \"Overtake that truck,\" Flood ordt!rs his aide, and, as the Cadillac accelerates, he leans out the window and shakes his fist at the driver: \"You bastard, you're going too fast! The bastard doesn't know that I built this highway.\" As Flood tells it, he was serving on another appropriations subcommittee, which had jurisdiction over the Bureau of Public Roads, when the planners sought funding for a major north-south interstate highway link(cid:173)ing Montreal to New Orleans. \"Well, that won't do me any good,\" Flood said after looking at the plans, which called for the road to pass far to the west of his district. \"Why?\" one planner asked. \"I'm from Wllkes-Ba\u00b7rre,\" Flood replied. Three weeks later, a new plan called for the highway to pass through Wilkes-Barre. \"The chairman of the subcommittee, John Rooney, was an usher at my wedding,\" Flood ex(cid:173)plained. In the decade after World War II, about the only new jobs created 1n Flood's cl1str1cts came as a result of his efforts----particularly through a series of federal area redevelop(cid:173)ment programs for which he claims primary responsibility.

            "1004": "42022 EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS December 20, 1974 of the economic summit meetings in Sep(cid:173)tember, insisted that the administration was mistaken in labeling inflation \"the No. 1 economic problem,\" rather than recession. But even the gloom-a.nd-doomers didn't pin(cid:173)point the spectacular collapse of the auto industry and the fa.st rise in unemployment. The prospect of the moment is for a. fourth consecutive decline in real Gross National Product for the three months ending Dec. 31-perhaps by 6 or 7 per cent. Unemploy(cid:173)ment is likely to pass 7 per cent early in 1975, and rise to at least 8 per cent by mid(cid:173)year, according to Arthur M. Okun, former chairman of the Council of Economic Ad(cid:173)visers under Lyndon Johnson. That's scary enough. But unless the Presi(cid:173)dent and the Congress come up with a vig(cid:173)orous anti-recession program that conscious(cid:173)ly ta.gs inflation as the No. 2 economic worry, economists like Okun see the economy con(cid:173)tinuing to go downhlll all through 1975, with \"double-digit\" unemployment rates. Okun says that such a possibility may be only one in four, but that's enough of a chance to demand insurance against it. What can be done? A beefed-up public service jobs program, and expanded unem(cid:173)ployment insurance package is already being generated on Capitol Hill and will become part of the administration program. But beyond that, many liberal and con(cid:173)servative economists have come to believe that a hefty tax cut has become an absolute necessity. Former assistant budget director Maurice Mann, now president of the San Francisco Home Loan bank boa.rd, has an intriguing idea built around \"a. negative tax surcharge.\" This would be a one-time reduc(cid:173)tion in personal income tax liab111ties to be enacted before next April 15. For example, if the \"negative tax surcharge\" were 10 per cent, a taxpayer owing $5,000 to Uncle Sam next April would lop $500 off his blll. Okun would try to direct a tax cut more specifically to lower income groups. Alto(cid:173)gether, he would push for a cut of a.bout $15 billion in the government tax-take. Judging from pa.st performance, such a program would be hard for President Ford and conservative advisers like Treasury Sec(cid:173)retary Wllliam E. Simon and CEA Chairman Alan Greenspan to swallow. Logically, they would have to abandon their firm position against any kind of direct intervention in wage and price decisions. But time is growing short. That's the mes(cid:173)sage that thoughtful Europeans-who once devoted all their concern to battling infla(cid:173)tion-have been trying to convey to high officials here. West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, on his recent visit here, urged President Ford and Mr. Simon to follow the lead of his country, which is cutting taxes, increasing public expenditure, and supplying a new tax credit to spur private investment. (The normally super-cautious Germans Will have a budget deficit of their own in the $20 billion range next year) . it looks now, the U.S. economy-the most important in the world-Will be the most depressed of all of the 14 nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 1975. There is a question, says a. recent OECD report, \"whether the rest of the OECD could enjoy a sustaineq expansion of activity along(cid:173)side such a weak picture for the United States.\" Translated, that means that unless Mr. Ford comes up with a bold program next month, there may be not only a protracted and serious recession here, but in the entire Western World. As [From the OU Daily, Dec. 4, 1974] STn.L NEEDED BUT LACKING: NATIONAL POLICY (By Keith Fanshier) We have talked in these columns so much of a. U.S. energy policy and the urgent need to evolve and formulate a. comprehensive, 'cohesive program, that the subject may seem time-worn, but it cannot be allowed to drop. Looking at the subject in the perspective of what has taken place in key, important industry meetings late this year, the issue is more critical than ever. It is the industry's, and the government's, prime responsibility, and it is the public's imperative need for security and safety in its daily life and living. The energy crisis persists, despite the un(cid:173)willingness in many quarters of government and public to concede it. The fact that for the moment it is not immediately pressuring the public is really a fact somewhat un(cid:173)fortunate for working out a Wise, appropriate formulation for creating such a policy, and implementing its early working. Time continues to run, and a.ccompllsh(cid:173)ment of this front, overall, is slow and sadly halting. True, some things of importance are in process of being worked out, but the broad, over-all, needed entity as a. whole of a character required to do the job remains missing. Increased supply of hydrocarbon energy is the basic needed element in the issue. Un(cid:173)fortunately, it remains a slow process, as the passing of years, since the energy problem began to take shape, testify. Meanwhile, ef(cid:173)forts a.re being made, and they are good ones, to moderate the rates of demand. But this should be regarded for what it is-as a secondary a.nd supplemental phase of the total problem and its solution. Together, then, we need wise, effective programs of stimulating supply, strengthened and aided by a correlative, simultaneous ac(cid:173)tivity of limiting demand. If these two facets both prove productive in their progress, the broad, fundamental result will be a most constructive one and they together wlll set the nation far along the course it must pursue to render it secure against serious danger in this unsettled world. But a sound policy is the heart and central factor in the whole matter. At this moment, it is unhappy but true that there is no as(cid:173)surance when an appropriate policy, strong and appropriate for the critical need, will be forthcoming. Certainly a look at Washington today is not such as to stimulate encour(cid:173)aging feelings on the subjects. So the public and the nation are st111 wait(cid:173)ing for a strong, appropriate national energy policy. The industry, too, inasmuch as much of its normal force and strength are now subject to government control, is likewise forced to await determinations which can come only from this same government. It is unfortunate that many of these legal requirements are of a nature aimed at a viable, workable policy program, but are without the cohesion, the organization, the workab111ty required by the nature of things to do the needed job and attain a momentum of force which would automatically bulld up added power as it proceeded, and thus achieve efficiency and operating productivity. Thus under proper, able leadership and executive talent, working on a. sound plan, this country could have a real national en(cid:173)ergy policy for the world to see and admire. When you say we have the worst form of government in the world, you have to add immediately: \"--except all the others.\" our government with all its faults can organize to do this great and basic job. OU and gas men generally-the people of all energy in(cid:173)dustries, should bring every force to bear upon the public, so that this public in turn, shall demand that government produce a fundamental program and policy that will command respect and begin to get needed results. It will be good for the nation, it will contribute to betterment of world conditions and it Will certainly help to sustain the position of our country for world leadership in this difficult national and international situation. Needed: and soon. rational, national energy policy, HON. CHET HOLIFIELD HON. DON EDWARDS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 19, 1974 I I Mr. EDWARDS of California. Mr. Speaker, I speak on this occasion with a great sense of poignancy, because, after many years of service to our coun(cid:173)try in the House of Representatives, the dean of the California delegation, CHET HOLIFIELD, is retiring. All of us in Con(cid:173)gress and indeed all of the people of our country are losing the privilege of having the immense skill and devotion of this :fine public servant as a Member of this body in the important years ahead. Within a few days of my coming to the House in early 1963, quickly learned to seek the counsel of CHET HOLIFIELD. I readily appreciated the high respect in which he was held by his colleagues, and so I wasted no time in trying to learn from this distinguished man. Mr. HOLI(cid:173)FIELD shared his expertise with me gra(cid:173)ciously and wlllingly. There was never a problem I could not take to him for guidance. think it accurate to state that the California delegation, the largest in the House, under the leadership of Dean HOLIFIELD has worked harmoniously and enthusiastically for the best interests of our State. Time after time Dean HOLI(cid:173)FIELD would call the delegation into emergency session to find the solution to an acute problem facing California. That we were successful in many instances is a great credit to our dean. Others will speak of CHET HOLIFIELD's accomplishments. They are major and impressive. He always fought for pro(cid:173)grams to help the poor and the elderly. His devotion to individual rights, due process, and privacy is a special star in his crown. It is not possible to talk about CHET HOLIFIELD without paying tribute to his partner of many years, our friend and his beloved wife, Cam. Cam made it pos(cid:173)sible for CHET to reach the highest pin(cid:173)nacles of achievement with her steady and loving support, with her warm un(cid:173)derstanding of the huge problems he faced, and her bravery and cheerfulness in times of disappointment and tragedy.

            "1054": "42072 WILLIAM E. TIMMONS, \"A JOB WELL DONE\" HON. ELFORD A. CEDERBERG OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, December 18, 1974 Mr. CEDERBERG. Mr. Speaker, the true stature and mark of any individual can usually best be judged as to how one serves and reacts under pressure and difficult, demanding situations. For 6 years, William E. Timmons, as Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs, has literally existed in a \"pressure cooker.\" Even under normal, routine cir(cid:173)cumstances his was a difficult assignment in maintaining liaison between the Con(cid:173)gress and the White House. We all are aware of the tremendous additional bur(cid:173)dens of that job in the past several months. But, Bill Timmons performed magnificently-without question, \"a job well done.\" As Bill now prepares to leave the White House and his service to our country, I am honored to join with so many other Members in expressing appreciation for his outstanding work and to wish him even greater success and happiness in the years ahead. It has been my distinct pleasure to know Bill personally for the nearly 15 years since he first came to Washington, D.C., as administrative assistant for then newly elected Congressman WILLIAM BROCK, now U.S. Senator BROCK, from Tennessee. Bill Timmons was a natural(cid:173)a great personality and with an ex(cid:173)tremely keen mind and sharpness. He joined the White House congres(cid:173)sional liaison staff in January 1969, and quickly rose to the top spot in directing the administration's vital contact with the Congress. He was a great spokesman for the White House in his representa(cid:173)tion of the administration's positions on vital legislative issue. In my 22 years in Congress and deal(cid:173)ing with six different administrations, I can attest that the professionalism of the White House congressional office was never higher or finer than that of Bill Timmons' group. I do not know Bill's future plans as he leaves this White House leadership role, but I am positive that whatever his en(cid:173)deavors he shall be highly successful. He has proved to be a man of great dedi(cid:173)cation and integrity. He has given his country the very best and for this, we are grateful. I w'ish him the greatest possible future success, happiness and good health in the years ahead. EQUIPMENT LEASING-THE IN(cid:173)VESTMENT TAX CREDIT GONE WILD HON. ,CHARLES A. VANIK OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, December 20, 1974 Mr. VANIK. Mr. Speaker, the current issue of Fortune magazine carries an im-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS pressive 27-page advertisement on the rapidly expanding equipment leasing in(cid:173)dustry. This industry, which is expand(cid:173)ing at an annual rate of 15 to 20 percent is almost entirely a creature of our ta~ laws. Presently, we give a 7-percent invest(cid:173)ment tax credit on the purchase of new industrial equipment. Many companies whose tax payments are already low find that they cannot us~ the credit to the fullest extent. Through a leasing ar(cid:173)rangement, they can convey this tax benefit to a financial institution-such as a commercial bank-in return for favorable financing. The bank buys the equipment, qualifies for the tax credit, and then turns around and leases the equipment to the original company at a cost below that of financing an out(cid:173)right purchase. Everybody's happy ex(cid:173)cept the U.S. Treasury, which suffers a loss. The Fortune advertisement reveals the absurd extent to which this practice has grown. Among other things, the Ameri(cid:173)can taxpayer is subsidizing: The leasing of two portable $20,000 handball courts for the largest swim and tennis club in Northern California\u00b7 A potato chip cooker for a food ~om\u00adpany in Utah; Furniture and fixtures-everything from kitchen sinks and carpeting to beds bar stools, and chairs-for several na~ tional motel chains; Electric golf cars to country clubs; Horses and cattle to U.S. investor syn(cid:173)dicates; and, . Elephants, zebras, lions, amusement rides and concession stand equipment for a commercial park in Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, this advertisement pro(cid:173)vides vivid testimony to what happens when a tax subsidy gets out of hand. Congress never envisioned the open mar(cid:173)ket exchange of tax benefits that the practice of equipment leasing represents. It is time we carefully reviewed this area to see how effective the investment tax credit actually has been in stimulating needed investment in our economy. I suspect the answers are not encouraging for the tax avoider. WAGE-PRiCE CONTROLS PLUS JOBS NOW HON. ROBERT L. LEGGETT OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, Decem_ber 20, 1974 Mr. LEGGETI. Mr. Speaker, it is ap(cid:173)parent that recession and unemployment may well have moved ahead of inflation as our major economic worry. Unem(cid:173)ployment at 6.5 percent in November is projected to reach 7 or 8 percent by mid-1975. Moreover, some economists are say(cid:173)ing it may reach double-digit levels if we do not move firmly in the next year. We must face the agonizing dllemma of deal(cid:173)ing with a rapidly deepening recession without abandoning the fight against in(cid:173)flation. December 2'0, 19 7 4 ~rthermore, many of One widely accepted remedy for our unemployment problem is a public or emergency jobs program. This is an ap(cid:173)proach that finds little opposition, and Just yesterday we approved a conference r~p?rt o:a a bill that would authorize $2.5 billion for public service jobs, with the House having originally authorized $2 billion and the Senate $4 billion. We must recognize that programs at these levels, however laudable, may not h~ve much effect on the unemployment :picture. According to a recent article m the Los Angeles Times by Robert J. Samuelson, even a $4 billion annual pro(cid:173)gram would provide only 500,000 jobs, less than 1 percent of employment versus our current 6.5 percent unemployment. these jobs may disappear by \"displacement\" if State and local governments use the money to hire people they would have hired anyWay with their own funds. Mr. Samuelson says more than 50 percent of the jobs created may be lost this way. . Economi~ts such as Otto Eckstein be(cid:173)lleve that Jobs programs of 4 or 5 times the\u00b7 level we approved, together with a tax cut of at least $15 billion, would be necessary to have a real impact on un(cid:173)e~ployment. This brings us face to face with the fundamental question of wheth-. er we can really curb inflation without a lengthy period of relatively high un(cid:173)employment. Milton Friedman thinks those proposed by Otto ~c~stem. would, after an initial decline m m~ation, push us back up to 15 per(cid:173)cent mflation within 2 years. It is analysis of this sort that leads me ~o conclude that wage-price controls are rn~scap~ble. If we are to continue to fight mflation while at the same time undertaking the jobs and tax measures needed to reduce unemployment, we must have a comprehensive program of wage-price-interest-profit controls. It is for this reason that I am introducing to(cid:173)gether with Congressmen Moss and PAT(cid:173)MAN legislation which would mandate wa:ge-price ~ntrols. I think this measure is m lme 'Yith th~ decision taken by the Kansas City Democratic mini-conven(cid:173)tion and the House Democratic Caucus to ~ove forcefully to deal with our eco(cid:173)nomic problems. Bob Samuelson's thought-provoking article on public jobs programs and the economy follows: measu~es like PuBLIC PROGRAM No JOBS FOR ECONOMY PANACEA (By Robert J. Samuelson) _As the White House and Congress grapple with the double infirmity of inflation and recession, only one widely-suggested remedy seems to -command anything like universal support: public service jobs. Almost every other proposal-wage-price controls, a tax increase, spending cuts, a tax reduction-has its own powerful camp of critics. But virtually no one i's against public service jobs. Even President Ford, cautioning against executive gloom about the economy may agree to support a larger public servic~ job program than he originally proposed. This consensus appears to represent llttle more than common sense. With the unemployment rate (6.5% in November) at its highest level since 1961 public service job proposals have an irresist~ Ible popular appeal. For the last month, the White House and Congress have been strug(cid:173)gling less to assure that new legislation passes ",

With(cid:173)in 60 days following such a certification, either house of Congress could nullify the authorization by voting its disapproval. The funds authorized for Diego Garcia were later deleted from the military construction ap(cid:173)propriations bill, but the President was given the option of seeking a new authorization in the next Congress if he deemed it in the U.S. national interest. State Department Authorization (P.L. 93-as 126, approved October 18, 1973 )-Another congressional protest over the manner in which this Administration handled U.S. in(cid:173)volvement in the Indochina War is embodied in P.L. 93-126. It requires prior congressional authorization for use on or after August 15, 1973, of any funds \"heretofore or hereafter appropriated\" to finance the involvement of U.S. armed forces in hostilities in, over or froin off the shores of North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia. Congress also barred the use of funds \"heretofore or here(cid:173)after appropriated\" for aid to North Vietnam unless specifically authorized by Congress. The two prohibitions were approved amendments to this year's State Department Authorization Act which authorizes $682 mil(cid:173)lion for fiscal 1974. In an attempt to curb the practice of rewarding campaign contribu(cid:173)tors with top diplomatic posts in other coun(cid:173)tries, Congress required in this legislation that any person nominated by the President for ambassador or minister must disclose at the time of his nomination all political con(cid:173)tributions and those of his immediate family for the period from the first day of the fourth calendar year preceding the year of the nomination and ending on the date of his nomination. USIA Authorization (P.L. 93-168, approved November 29, 1973)--Congress cleared an au(cid:173)thorization of $215,614,000 for the U.S. In(cid:173)formation Agency in fl.seal 1974 after a Presi(cid:173)dential veto of a similar b111 (S. 1317) on October 23. The original bill contained an access-to-information clause, directed at ex(cid:173)panding congressional access to USIA docu(cid:173)ments. The provision would have required a cutoff of funds for the USIA if the agency failed to respond within 35 days to a written request of either the House Foreign Affairs or the Senate Foreign Relations Committees for documents or other information relating to the agency. In vetoing this bill the Presi(cid:173)dent claimed that the access-to-information provision was an unconstitutional encroach(cid:173)ment on executive prerogatives. The new b111 bars the use of any appropriation for pro(cid:173)grams not yet authorized or any appropria(cid:173)tions above the amount authorized, but makes this provision non-applicable to funds subsequently authorized or to funds made available through the fl.seal 1974 continuing funding resolution. State Department-United States Informa(cid:173)tion Agency Fiscal 1975 Authorization (P.L. 93-475, approved October 26, 1974)-For Fis(cid:173)cal Year 1975, Congress authorized an expen(cid:173)diture of $741,901,000 for the State Depart(cid:173)ment's operations and programs and $239,-538,000 for the United States Information Agency. The figure for the State Department is $62,129,000 less than the Administration requested. In response to increased terrorist activities against foreign service personnel, Congress authorized the payment of a gratu(cid:173)ity to the surviving dependent of any For(cid:173)eign Service employee killed in the line of duty in the amount of one year's salary of the deceased. This provision was made retro(cid:173)active to January 1, 1973 and would be appli(cid:173)cable to the six persons who died under those circumstances between January 1, 1973 and August 1974. Included in this legislation is $40,000,000 to aid in the resettlement of Jews emigrating from the Soviet Union. This ac-represents a continuation of U.S. policy dur(cid:173)ing the past two years, when $86,500,000 was appropriated for this purpose. The authorization Act also repeals the Formosa Resolution of 1955 which authorized the President to send U.S. Forces to the de(cid:173)fense of Formosa, the Pescadores and related territory in the area. This provision was seen as an indication of congressional efforts to place limits on U.S. commitments abroad. Another provision requires that nominees for ambassadorial posts must have listed in the Congressional Record reports on political con(cid:173)tributions they have made, in order to try to separate political considerations from such appointments. Finally, it was declared the sense of Congress that U.S. civilian and mili(cid:173)tary personnel overseas be reduced and that a five-year plan on future U.S. aid to South Vietnam be submitted to Congress for con(cid:173)sideration. Israel Emergency Assistance (P.L. 93-199, approved December 26, 1973)-In order to assist Israel to replace military equipment used during the recent Mideast war between Israel and the Arab states, Congress voted $2.2 billion in aid. The assistance authoriza(cid:173)tion was attached to the Foreign Aid Ap(cid:173)propriations \u00b7Act for fl.seal 1974, and agreed to after the House rejected an effect to cut from the blll $20 million in military credit sales for Saudi Arabia. The purpose of the emergency assistance measure is to help maintain a military balance necessary for the achievement of peace in the Middle East through authoriz1.Iig funds in emergency se(cid:173)curity assistance to Israel. The legislation places certain restrictions on the use of as(cid:173)sistance in excess of $1.5 billion. Prior to the obligation or expenditure of such assistance the President will be required to make a determination that the aid is needed, and he must report to the Congress at least 20 days prior to the date on which funds are obligated. Congress also authorize\"d the Presi(cid:173)dent to use such sums as may be necessary from the amounts authorized in the bill, for payment of the U.S. share of the expense of the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East. The legislation directs the Sec(cid:173)retary of Defense to conduct a study of the 1973 Arab-Israeli conflict to ascertain the effectiveness of the foreign military assist(cid:173)ance program as it related to the Mideast conflict and to report to Congress no later than December 31, 1974. The President is au(cid:173)thorized, at any time prior to June 30, 1974, to release Israel from its contractual liabil(cid:173)ity to pay for defense articles and services purchased or financed under the Foreign Military Sales Act during the period from October 6, 1973 through June 30, 1974 and to apply the funds approved in this Act to those contracts. Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty (P.L. 93-129, approved October 1, 1973)-For fl.seal 1974, Congress authorized appropriations of $50,209,000 for operation of Radio Free Eu(cid:173)rope and Radio Liberty. The Act creates a new seven-member Board for International Broadcasting to make grants to the sta(cid:173)tions and to oversee their operations, a duty previously performed by the Department of State. The Board had been recommended by a nresidential commission set up to study alternative methods of financing the two radio systems. Coast Guard Authorizations. Fiscal 1974 (P.L. 93-65, approved July 9, 1973)-For Fis(cid:173)cal Year 1974 Congress authorized appropri(cid:173)ations for the Coast Guard totaling $109,-239,000 for procurement and renovation of vessels, for aircraft, and for construction. A maximum number of active duty personnel was set at 37,607. The authorization provides $23,979,000 for the procurement and reno(cid:173)v,ation of vessels and $75,260,000 for con(cid:173)struction. In addition, there are special au(cid:173)thorizations of $3,000,000 for the procure(cid:173)ment of a long range search and rescue heli-International Development Association (P.L. 93-373, approved August 14, 1974)-An expenditure of $1.5 billion over a four year period was approved by Congress as the United States' fourth contribution to the In(cid:173)ternational Development Association. The agency is a branch of the World Bank that makes long-term loans with little or no in(cid:173)terest to the poorest developing nations for programs in transportation, education, agri(cid:173)culture, and industrial areas. In a formula worked out in 1973, the United States contri(cid:173)bution was reduced from 40 percent to 3311.i percent of the entire fund. In addition to the general authorization, the legislation in(cid:173)structs the U.S. Governor to the Association to vote against loans to countries develop(cid:173)ing nuclear devices unless they are parties to the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Wea.pons Treaty. This provision was included as a re(cid:173)sponse to a nuclear explosion by India in June, 1974. copter and $7,000,000 for payments to bridge owners for alteration of railroad and public highway bridges to permit navigation. Coast Guard Authorizations, Fiscal 1975 (PL. 93-430, approved October 1, 1974)-Fis(cid:173)cal Year 1975 authorizations for the Coast Guard include $22,676,000 for the procure(cid:173)ment and renovation of vessels, including pollution control equipment for Coast Guard vessels; $17,793,000 for procurement of eight medium-range search aircraft; and $74,731,-000 for construction and development of in(cid:173)stanations and facilitiee. Maximum active duty strength was raised from 37,607 37,748. The Act also directs the Secretary of the Coast Guard to cooperate with the Sec(cid:173)retaries of Commerce, State, Defense, and the Treasury, and with the Attorney General in conducting a study of methods of enforcing fishery management jurisdiction in U.S. wa(cid:173)ters, including the possible extension of U.S. jurisdiction. The methods to be studied in(cid:173)clude, but are not limited to, the use of satel(cid:173)lites, remo,te sensing, vessels, aircraft, radar, and devices implanted on the sea.floor. to Asian Development Bank Authorizations (P.L. 93-537, approved December 22, 1974)(cid:173)Congress passed legislation authorizing $362 million over a three year period for the capi(cid:173)tal replenishment of the Asian Development Bank. The purpose of the Bank is to invest funds contributed by wealthy nations in Asia and the West in the economic development of the poorer nations of Asia. Forty-one na(cid:173)tions are official members of the Bank, 17 of which are donors to the capital pool-now totaling $2.8 billion. The funds authorized by the House are part of the replenishment ef(cid:173)fort underway by donor nations since 1972. Unlike the practice in other lending institu(cid:173)tions, the United States is not the principal contributor. To date, the most money has been contributed by Japan, followed by India and Australia, and then the U.S. The largest recipient nations have been, in order, South Korea, Philippines, Pakistan, Malaysia, and Thailand. The types of projects in which funds have been invested include electric power, industry, transportation and com(cid:173)munications, and agriculture. This legisla(cid:173)tion restores the U.S. voting power to seven(cid:173)teen percent, the same as Japan's, and repre(cid:173)sents the first U.S. contribution since the Bank was founded in 1966. United Nations Peacekeeping Forces (H.R. 16982 passed the House November 18, 1974)(cid:173)The House passed and sent to the Senate leg(cid:173)islation authorizing funds for the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Middle East and Cyprus for fl.seal 1975. A total of $4.8 million was allocated for the United Nations Force in Cyprus, and a total\u00b7 of not more than 28.89 percent of the cost of the United Nations Disengagement Observor Force and the Emergency Force in the Middle East was authorized for the operations in that area.

There are many things that could be said of THAD DULSKI in summing up his fine career. He served his constituents and his district in the highest tradition. He served his State and was ever mind(cid:173)ful of New York's unique needs. And he served his country-as an individual Member of Congress, and as chairman of the Post Office and Civil Service Com(cid:173)mittee. The Federal workers of America have much for which to thank THAD Dul.SKI. He reorganized the antiquated Post Of(cid:173)fice into the improved and streamlined postal service. He has improved the re(cid:173)tirement and health benefits systems for civil servants. He has completely re(cid:173)formed the salary and pay raise mechan(cid:173)ism of the civil service. His improvemenrts to the civil service and postal service have benefited every American.

His devotioIJ. to the freedom of all people has served as a beacon to those who still must fight for personal and po(cid:173)litical freedom.

His unfailing courtesy and attention to the needs of the Members earned him steady promotion until he became Door(cid:173)keeper of the House, a title which in no way reflects the importance of his office, and where he supervised more than 300 employees with an annual payroll of more than $1.3 million per year.

Mr. Speaker, CHET HOLI(cid:173)FIELD, dean of California's congressional delegation, is, to the regret of his col(cid:173)leagues and the public, retiring from Congress after 32 years of outstanding public service; a term never exceeded by any California member since our State was admitted to the Union in 1850. It is a well-earned retirement for an out(cid:173)standing, much respected, and much loved man. During his tenure in this House, par(cid:173)ticularly as chairman of the Government Operations Committee, he has made im(cid:173)mensely significant contributions to American Government. As a result of his successful labors, our Government has become more effective, and efficient in innumerable ways. Having served with him for 22 years, I know, admire, and respect him far be(cid:173)yond the limited powers of words describe. Under his direction, legislation was de(cid:173)veloped and enacted into law creating several new Federal energy organiza(cid:173)tions. These include the Federal Energy Administration, Energy Research arid Development Administration, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and an Energy Resources Council. He authored the Fed(cid:173)eral Property and Administrative Serv(cid:173)ices Act, which created the General Serv(cid:173)ices Administration, to give central di(cid:173)rection to Government procurement and property management. Later, he devel(cid:173)oped legislation for a comprehensive, systematic review of Government pro(cid:173)curement practices; the Commission on Government Procurement. As a result of his initiatives, proce(cid:173)dures have been simplified to expedite smaller Federal purchases, saving tax(cid:173)payers $100 million annually. He is re(cid:173)sponsible for establishing the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, carrying with it potential savings to taxpayers of billions of dollars. Without his efforts, we would have not obtained improved amendments to the Freedom of Information Act. Under his chairmanship, the Federal Advisory Committee Act was enacted, requiring Federal advisory committees to be pub(cid:173)licly identified and minutes of their pro(cid:173)ceedings be made publicly available. As a result the public is entitled to know who advises Government and how much advice is given. CHET.'s work on legisla-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS tion to insure an individual's rights of privacy in handling Government records is another landmark in civil liberties legislation. This alone is a monument to his legislative record. His work on the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy on which he has served since its inception in 1946, is an out(cid:173)standing accomplishment in and of itself. He has always insisted on civilian con(cid:173)trol of the atom, vigorous research into its peaceful uses and international agree(cid:173)ments aimed at bringing benefits to all mankind. In addition to serving on the Hoover Commission, he managed legislation creating two Cabinet-level departments; Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. CHET'S awards are as numerous as his accomplishments. These include three honorary degrees; the coveted Congres(cid:173)sional Distinguished Service Awards of the American Political Science Associa(cid:173)tion and the Henry DeWolf Smyth Nu(cid:173)clear Statesman Award. Throughout his career he has battled for civil liberties and civil rights with courage, consistency, and energy. Among his many successful endeavors in this field was authorship of the bill establish(cid:173)ing the Cabinet Committee on Opportu(cid:173)nities for the Spanish-speaking people within the Office of the President. It wotild be a simple matter to list more such accomplishments on behalf of our country, and to continue indefinitely without exhausting his credits. Yet, it is CHET'S personal qualities which have enabled him to do so much on behalf of us all. We all are aware of his warmth, compassion and dedication to public service. His personal character has been noted by everyone in this House. His private life has always been exemplary; we all know him to be an ideal husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. I know that as he and his lovely wife, Cam, leave us for what I know will be a long and fruitful retirement, they will know they carry with them the deepest affection and respect of every Member of this House and of every American. We are all the richer for his efforts and all the poorer for his retirement. ANDREY AVINOFF, ARTIST HON. LESLIE C. ARENDS OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES Friday, December 20, 1974 Mr. ARENDS. Mr. Speaker, in the last decade we have seen greater official rec(cid:173)ognition of art and art forms and the individual contributions of native born and naturalized American artists. A good friend and a patron of the arts in Pittsburgh, George R. Hann, has called my attention to the credo of one such artist-the late Dr. Andrey Avinoff-who came to the United States from the So(cid:173)viet Union in 1917 and whose work has been widely acclaimed. For the benefit of those who admired Dr. Avinoff's painting, as well as others in the art world, I am glad to include his credo herewith: December 2'0, 19 7 4 ANDREY AVINOFF: HIS ARTISTIC CREDO Ever since I can remember I have loved drawing and painting. At the age of four years I drew a mountainous landscape, the like of which I have not since equalled, if the satisfaction and pride which I felt at that time are to be accepted as criterions. The quite startling understanding of distance and significance which those receding mountain peaks, each topped by a fine eagle, gave to me was one of the important experiences in my, until then, level existence. This proved to be but a first happening, in a. chain of ad(cid:173)ventures, which seem to have put me in di(cid:173)rect contact with an unexpected variety of artistic sources. Many of the unaccountable incidents and vicissitudes, which came to me in subsequent years, had no \u00b7apparent con(cid:173)nection with art, and yet from them I have \u00b7 been permitted tO build a delibe;ate and not unfounded point of view, which, taken to(cid:173)gether with a conscientious attempt to se(cid:173)cure technical freedom, have resulted in my present attitude towards aesthetics and to(cid:173)wards art. It is the contact with many cycles and sources which leads me to believe in the desirability of a diversity of style, by which the artist may more fully reflect his own im(cid:173)pulse and his understanding of the ten(cid:173)dencies characterizing various artistic tradi(cid:173)tions. I always consider butterflies as my main instructors in Art. Since childhood I have made paintings of them, endeavoring to re(cid:173)produce every shade of their color, and every minute detail of pattern. Naturally, my eye has been trained to notice the slightest vari\u00b7ations in this respect. The question of ornamental value of the butterfly's wings attracted me as one of the mo.st fascinating problems connected with my fravorite branch of entomology. Together with systematic and biological investigations, I regard as most instructive the study of the laws of color and the patte.rn variations and interconnec(cid:173)tions exhibited by the butterfly wings, which after all, represent the unique phenomenon ln nature of a rigid, flat and ornamented .mrface, stretched onto veins. This surface is devoid of any marked structural irregu(cid:173)larity. The study of each pattern infinitely varies though manifestly subject to certain laws of balance, symmetry, ornamental rep(cid:173)etitions in the very intricaite striation, pe(cid:173)culiar ocellation and elaborate border de(cid:173)signs-and discloses wonderfully 1lluminat(cid:173)ing material on decoration as pure crystal(cid:173)lization of natural ornament, independent of any epoch or national taste. Perhaps one of the most instructive features of the color(cid:173)ing of butterflys' and moths' wings, is not so much how the colors are matched, as in what proportion of relative areas, equal or inter(cid:173)rupted, they are combined. The elements of quality and quantity are here equally signifi(cid:173)cant. One can find, on these winged jewels, examples of dynamic symmetries, \"construc(cid:173)ti veisms,\" \"suprematism,\" so much spoken about now-a-days, and a great deal more besides, never dreamed by any modernist(cid:173)prophet. I decidedly consider a close and thorough(cid:173)ly systematic study of color rotations and pattern variations of lepidopera, most valu(cid:173)able guide for developing a sense of color composition and a feeling for harmonious and natural ornamentation. Besides the scientific interest and gra.t1\u00b7 fication which I derived from entomology, I feel myself immeasurably indebted in my work as an artist, to the winged creatures that received from the ancient Greeks the fitting name of Psyche. Voyaging about the world brought me in contact again, at a mature age, with the magic and charm of Asia.tic art. It was a true inspiration to admire the glories of India-Buddhist, Hindu and Mahometan(cid:173)the phantasmagorical temples of South In(cid:173)dia, the grace and abstract perfection of Mogul art, the fascinating mystery and pro-"
