Steele) The oil indus try has stockpiled enough oil to get the country almost through February--even if all refineries were shut down tomorrow and if homeewners and business would not turn back their thermostats. As of Dec. 21, the supply of home heating: oil, kerosene and other distillate fuels stored. by oil companies totaled 203 million barrelsup 23 percent over the 165 million barrels. on hand one year earlier. That is enough fuel oil to last for 58 days. (or to Feb. 17) , according to estimates madeby the America-n Petroleum Institute (API) .. an industry trade organization. The estimates are based on demand figures calculated by the U. S. Bureau of Mines. For this time of year, the 203 millionbarrel supply (there are 42 gallons in a barrel) represents, in terms of volume, one or the largest stockplles of distillate !uel oil in. the nation's history. This is the situation in the wake of a series. of statements by the Federal government. urging homeowners and businesses alike to. turn back their thermostats or else risk living. and working in homes and otnces without: heat. In a nationwide television address last Nov_ 25, President Nixon first stressed the need for allocating ~uel oil, saying the government. planned to reduce supplies to industry by 10. percent, to homeowners by 15 percent and tocommercial establishments by 25 percent. \"For the average American family,\" the President sald, \"this cutback in heating o11 does not mean severe discomfort for anyone, but it wUl mean that everyone should lower the thermostat ... by six degrees below its. normal setting.\" The goal was to achieve a national daytim&. average of 68 degrees. The President warned .. \"Those who taU to adopt such a cutback risk running out of fuel be!bre the winterisover.\" A fact sheet, distributed by the WhiteHouse before that speech, estimated\u00b7 that the. shortage of dtstmate fuel oil would ave~ about 900,000 barrels a day during the comIng winter months. That was an increase of 100 percent over the projected shortage reported a little more than two weeks earller in another White House fact sheet, when the shortage was placed at 450,000 barrels a day.

The answer is obvious. This is economic discrimination of the worst sort. And I might add that any of my colleagues shortsighted enough vote against my amendment because it would have an adverse impact on one or two projects in their State may find that they are sowing the seeds of destructive public policy in the future as good projects in their State go by the boards while less justifiable programs are pursued. Some may argue that my amendment would adversely affect projects authorized many years ago as part of a system of water resource projects, thus adversely affecting an entire program. Or it may be possible to point to communities that have relied on a previously authorized project, to their detriment if the project is not constructed. That is exactly why I have left it up to the executive branch agencies to make the decision as to whether or not to apply the new discount rate of older projects. This will permit the flexibility needed to take account of mitigating circumstances. Finally let me point out that the death of an ineflicien t project does not mean that a particular erosion or flood control problem can never be resolved. There are many ways to skin a cat. There are all sorts of solutions to individual ftood control problems. Some of them may be less costly and have a lesser impact on the environment than a project authorized 5 or 10 years ago. My amendment would focus attention on these alternative solutions. Before I conclude I want to make it clear that my amendment articulates and represents the administration's position on the subject. In order to drive this point home I would like to quote from a news release put out by the Water Resources Council last August announcing the new planning criteria for the Nation's water resources. These criteria include the discount rate formula implemented by my amendment--the formula that the Senate Public Works Committee has attempted to nullify through the language contained in section 65 of the bill. Here is what the President said about the new standards, including the new discount formula: The Principles and Standards \". . . represent the culmination of several years review by the Water Resources Council to develop improved planning criteria to achieve our goal of wise use of the Nation's water and related land resources with full consideration to the protection of our environment. I commend the Water Resources Counc11 for accomplishing such a difficult task.\" Secretary of the Interior Morton had this to say about the new discount rate formula: It is felt that the discount rate provision will foster the planning of better programs and projects for a given level of Federal investment.

Mr. Speaker, at a time when Alexander Solzhenitsyn's brilliant new work on Soviet concentration camps has focused world attention on the repressive practices of the Soviet Union over the years, it is especially appropriate to remember the valiant and hardworking people of the Ukraine who have been struggling against these policies for over half a century. For most of the\u00b7 past 300 years the Ukraine has been submerged in the massive Russian state and for most of those years, the Ukrainian people battled valiantly against czars and later Communists in an effort to win the inalienable rights of people everywhere, namely personal and political freedom. For just one bright, shining moment, when czarist authority was first smashed in 1917 the Ukrainian people were able to gain their freedom and create their own state. That interlude began on January 22, 1918, and ended 5 short years later, when Bolshevik occupation finally took over. Today, 56 years later, Ukrainians are still in political and intellectual bondage. Their brief taste of independence evaporated all too quickly. But even though the independent State of the Ukraine is only a memory today, the spirit of freedom stlll burns brightly in the minds and hearts of all Ukrainian people everywhere. In this era of detente with the Soviet Union, we must never forget that the leaders in the Kremlin are still suppressing the legitimate hopes and aspirations of the Ukrainian people for freedom and self-determination. Yet this suppression has merely served to strengthen the spirit and the resolve of the people of the Ukraine. And it is this brave spirit which we commemorate today, on the anniversary of Ukrainian independence, and which we deeply believe will eventually bring the Ukraine back into the world community again as a free and independent state.

            "454": "REMARKS BY Gov. DOLPH BRISCOE Thank you for a kind and generous introduction. I know of no other place where I feel more at home than I do with you. For a great number of years I have worked closely with you and I know personally the great contribution the men and women of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station have made to the progress of Texas. Working with your partners-the Texas Agricultural Extension Service-the many lasting benefits of research have been carried to the people of this State, and as a result of these efforts, all Texans have enjoyed a more abundant life. President Williams, I would like to thank you, Dean H. 0. Kunkel, Directors Mlller and Hutchinson and the many dedicated members of this university staff both here and in the field for our favorable position in agriculture. Of course, many of you hold joint teaching appointments and I express appre \u2022 elation also to those dedicated teachers who are training the young men and women who will lead agriculture and home economics in the future. Dr. Wllliams, in my opinion the land grant university concept of teaching, research and extension is one of America's great achievements. I hope that the high priorities given to agriculture and rural life in the past will be accelerated in the future. You are assured of my continued support for your efforts. You are aware that one of the goals of my ad.ministration is to make Texas Number One in Agriculture, not only in volume of sales but in profits to the farmers and ranchers of this State. If we achieve this goal then we all must accelerate our efforts. I believe no one could be engaged in a more exciting career than in today's dynamic agriculture. Agriculture is really the great hope of our country. Not only does it feed and clothe our people but agriculture has become the one tool with which we can compete most efficiently in foreign markets. Dean Kunkel, in his annual report message, said \"an agronomist can no longer be concerned only with producing the seed, but he has to be part of the team concerned with the disposal of the straw.\" Yes, the agronomist has to be a team member. You are developing a team approach and I congratulate you on the strides you are making. The fourteen designated research and extension centers, one of which is located in my home town of Uvalde, provide truly effective multidisciplinary task forces, dedicating their efforts toward solution to the problems of the areas in which they are located. The conduct of research by the station is organized into projects which outline objectives. This provides for necessary coordination to insure that the most important priority problems are being investigated and prevents costly and unnecessary duplication. The Research and Extension Centers and dynamic area development programs such as B.E.T., B.I.G., P.E.P., South Plains, E1 Paso, Rolllng Plains and the new one just recently organized at Uvalde can continue to make Texas agriculture a leading economic and social base for a more prosperous Texas. After all, the principle measure of research success is the impact that research has had on the economy and well being of the people of the State. No one would deny that Texas agriculture and its associated supplying, processing a.nd distributing industries have been transformed. dramatically in recent years. And agricultural research has been the basis for every change--the new varieties of cotton, rice, vegetables and grain sorghums, the modern fertilization practices, the new equipment and processes, the new management and cultural practices, the new livestock rations and feeding systems. As only one measure of value of agricultural research ",

Comment: Again, how relevant ~ a 1969 evaluation to a. Report issued 1n March 1978? An evaluation of Project B conducted for OEO by an outside firm in November 1970 indicated that staff attorneys \"were heavlly involved in community organizing, often at the expense of their caseloads\". Community organizing 1s an activity which ts central to such law reform activities as grassroots lobbying. To lbe sure, 1n October 1971 someone found that only 4 out of 8 law reform units required 'by the nationa.l Office were operational. But by what yardstick was GAO able to determine that 8 would not have ibeen excessive? Not only is the question of the propriety of law reform begged, but the question of how much is enough. Besides, 1f it is possl!ble that 4 vigorous and activist units could accomplish more than 8 mediocre ones, ought not a judgment on the effectiveness of law ll'eform to focus on the quaJ.ity and extent of the activity of the 4 units? No description of Project B's l&w reform activity ts provided, and so the issue is resolved mechanically by the number of law reform units in operation. 3. Project C: \"The grantee's 1970 self-evaluation report stated that a substantial, effective and organized law reform program was lacking. The grantee's executive director reported in Ma.y and August 1971 that the law reform unit was in a state of flux and not able to produce as much as had been anticipated.\" \u00b7 (a) a. self-evaluation can either exaggerate law reform activity to win praise or underestimate it to win dollars and (lb) self-evaJ.ua.tions conducted ln 1970 and in August 1971 could hardly lbe expected to be current as of March 1978, the date of the GAO Report. In December 1972, OEO had an evaJ.ua.tion of a. signlfl.cant portion of Project C performed by an outside evaluator who found that fully one fourth of the attorney staff (8 out of 12 attorneys') were devoting themselves full-time to law reform, with a caseload of approximately 45 C'UlTent open cases. In addition the project was active in organiZing the local Welfare Rights Organization and was serving as house counsel for the National Tenants Union. These latter activities are characteristic of projects which are activist and law-reform oriented. 4. Project D: \"A grantee official informed us that the project had not been involved in any significant law reform activities.\" Comment: Here again there is no reference to a mutually agreed upon criterion of what constitutes \"significant\" law reform activity, and there is no indication GAO used any additional informa.tdon, such as an OEO evaluation, a.s a check on the grantee official's opinion. It happens that a.n OEO evaluation conducted in November 1970 agrees with what GAO was told: there was little or no law reform. The reason given by OEO's evaluators is that the director wished to run his program like a. regular law office with service to indigent cltents being the top priority. The GAO Report concedes that each of the three remaining programs was adequately involved i.n law reform, and this judgment is borne out by self evaluations and by evaluations conducted by outsiders for OEO. Project E, the Legal Services Program's second largest, was not only adequately involved in law reform. but heavUy involved, so heavily that the Project was recently the subJect of an article 1n a national journal of opinion faulting it for excessive involvement.

            "854": "39, p. 23, App. -)40 The Board has fatled to inquire into an area of ratemaking which petitioners specifically placed in issue an4 which the Board itself has perceived as critical. Taxing petitioners with falling to supply an \"evidentiary basis\" for their position (73-7-39, p. 22, App. -) is as much beside the point as noting that they did not make \"studies\" {Tr. 645), or that their witness never held a management position with an airline. (Tr. 700) a. The Board has given three other reasons for its lack of concern about dilution in this case: (a) \"the fact that some passengers may have paid too much because others paid too little could not support a finding of unjust enrichment to the carriers to make amends or restitution\" (73-7-39, p. 23, App. -); (b) \"it would be plainly inequitable for the Board to refuse retroactively to recognize the dilution resulting from the charging of discount fares which had become embedded in the fare structure over a period of many years through the filing of tariffs which the Board had allowed to become effective\" (73-7-39, p. 24, App. -); and (c) Order 69-9-68 \"had the effect of decreasing the actual dilution.'' (73-7-39, p. 24, App. -) But none of these points is persuasive. The issue at hand is not whether the carriers were \"unjustly enriched\" but whether the fares in question were \"just and reasonable.\" And the fact that full-fare passengers were called upon to pay too much in order to subs1d1ze diluted-yield passengers is very much a part of that issue. Moreover, the contention that \"some passengers may have paid too much because others paid too little\" is overly simplistic. The ratema.king problem under discussion here is not that discount fares were too low in some absolute sense, but that the carriers added excess capacity in order to carry diluted-yield traffic at a reduced profit margin. This invariably results in higher costs, lower returns, and, under the Board's cost-plus approach to ratemaking, fare increases. If capacity had been controlled by means of appropriate standards, fares could have been lower throughout the system. And if reasonable load factor and dilution adjustments are made now, it may well appear that discount-fare passengers did not in fact pay \"too little\" during the period in question. The problem, in other words, is not merely one of discrimination, but one of excess as well. The Board recognized as much in Order 72-12-18. The short answer to the Board's contention with respect to \"retroactivity\" is, again, that the statutory provisions allowing for judicial review place the carriers on notice that fare increases may ultimately be found unreasonable. There is no \"inequity\" in such a finding. Finally, it is irrelevant whether or not the October 1969 fares may have reflected some minor improvements on those that prevailed previously. The fares in question here are the responsiblllty of the Board and carriers. They assert that these fares can be reconciled with the statutory provisions governing \"justness and reasonableness.\" Whether the previous fares were a \"hodgepodge\" or not (I.D., p. 34, App. -), they cannot legitimize subsequent fares which cannot withstand scrutiny on their own. Moreover, it is especially inappropriate to point to earlier fares for justification when the Board and carriers had devised a ratemaking system which e1fect1vely precluded judicial review. The Board has sought to excuse the carriers on the basis of its poor ratemaklng performance in the past and the carriers \u2022 poor financial performance under the October 1969 fa.res. This is consistent with neither the. statute nor the Board's duties to the public.

            "904": "Last fall, Amtrak, which is supposed to entice people back to the pleasures of railroad travel, began to set up a computerized, national telephone reservation system of the kind the airlines have used for years. The system's capacity seemed sufficient for five years. Then, on November 19, the President proclaimed the energy crisis, gasoline and jet fuel supplies seemed threatened, people took to the ralls, and, what with the Christmas holidays, the new reservation system was jammed by the sudden, overwhelming demand for seats. As a result, it still can be somewhat annoying to reserve an Amtrak railroad ticket. And that pretty wellillustra.tes our passenger train dilemma. Amtrak, with the help of airline and travel agency experts, seems to have done a good, slow, difllcult but conscientious job of keeping ran travel from going the way of the stage coach. From 1945 until Amtrak was Ia.unched in May 1971, the railroads ha.d steadily lost 15 per cent of their passengers every year. Now they are regaining 11 per cent every year. This is due to a number of visible improvements. Amtrak, first of all, consolidated the passenger runs across the country to a bare minimum. Some cities, such as Cleveland, are not served by passenger trains at all. Next Amtrak began to improve the cars. Oniy half of the existing 3,000 cars were considered salvageable. The other half are being refurbished at the ra.te of first 48 and lately 70 cars a month. New diesel locomotives have been put in service or ordered. The ChicagoSt. Louis run has a whole new train, made in France. Personnel has been retrained. There is now a nationwide timetable. Many cities have downtown ticket offices and some have had their railroad stations cleaned and repainted. Three new stations--at Jacksonville, Fla., Springfield, Mass., and Cincinnati, Ohio-have been built. There has even been some modest innovation. Some of the long distance trains have passenger representatives to help make people comfortable and some, like the Montrealer, include recreation cars that offer games and movies and have a piano player along for entertainment. The Interstate Commerce Commission, furthermore, is about to issue new customer service standards for passenger railroads that will insist on proper luggage handling, a !air reservation system and punctual performance. Under the new rulings, railroads can be fined tor being late. But like the new reservation system, all these gains are likely to be overwhelmed by the new demand on railroad travel created by the energy crisis. There is not enough eqUlpm.ent to handle a. sudden increase in passengers. It will take years to build additional cars and locomotives, particularly since Amtrak rightly insists on new, up-todate des1~ and engineering rather t-han reordering obsolete models. The refurbishing program can, of course, be accelerated. But there is ~ yet little incentive and less money to get the railroads ready for the new pas-",

From there he went to Berkeley, majored in economics, joined a fraternity, and quit after eighteen months because it had a white clause. He also during this time became friends with the Hallinans, Peter Franck, and Arjay Lenske. After graduating from Berkeley, he went to Ha-stings Law School in San Francisco. \"Being a lawyer seemed to me to be the slickest capitalistic rip-off and professional position one could get, and it seemed I could placate my conscience, to the extent that I had a conscience, by occasionally doing things with the law that one couldn't do in other professions. I had wanted to be a lawyer for a long time, to make a lot of money, get an elite position, and protect the hell out of tt for the rest of my life. \"But the more I got into the law, the more I realized what a morass it was, that the poor and people of color were treated differently, and that it really hadn't changed that much from feudalistic times in England.\" In law school he first met Joe Rhine, the son of union organizers who were active in the labor movement from the thirties through the fifties.

Mr. President, I expect to vote for the kind of excess profits tax that would work, and would not keep us from getting energy for the American people at a time when they need it desperately. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, what we are really doing if we approve this bill is playing a gigantic con game on the American public, because it is not constitutional, it will not work, and it is not a tax, and I do not think the President. on his worst day, could conceivably sign this bill. Nevertheless, I think we ought to recognize who we are putting a burden on with this bill. That is, the local gasoline station owners and it will bankrupt them. They cannot live under it. Think of a situation where the President sets the price at the retail level, and then the fllling station operator follows the price the President sets. Then along come a bunch of customers and complain that the price he charged, based upon what the President set, gives him an excess profit, so they go up to the Renegotiation Board, which has the authority under the law to decide that in fact, after using all these guidelines I read into the RECORD, he is charging an excess amount. So then they haul him before the Renegotiation Board, with maybe 10 complaints or 50 complaints, and now he has got to pay back money. There is no way in the world, under the free enterprise system, for any retailer to survive under this provision. The Senator from Washington and the Senator from Maine both know it is a bad provision. They will both say so. They both voted against it. Yet they want to stick by the provision because they say that is all they can get out of the conference. Now let us look at the argument that there are a bunch of urgent things in here. I just called WILBUR MILLS and talked with him at home, and I asked him about whether, if something happened at this conference and they did not come back with any agreement, he considered it important that we have some unemployment compensation act provision such as is in this blll, or better.

Simon offer a refreshing and long-awaited change from the chaos and false steps of previous so-called \"energy czars\" and \"advisers.\" I feel that H.R. 11793, by setting a 2-year authorization period for the FEA, puts a sensible limit on the lifespan of our emergency energy regulatory apparatus. Provision is made in the bill for Presidential recommendations for either continuance or other disposition of the functions assembled under the aegis of the Federal Energy Administrator. I feel that one lesson that we ought to have ~earned by the experience of the last year Is that regular and frequent reviews of our energy policymaking procedures and goals are a necessity if we are not again to be caught as fiat-footed as we were by the Arab boycott. Mr. Chairman, I am aware that some Members are alarmed by what they characterize as the sweeping breadth of power which has been deputized to the FEA by this legislation. I think it important to point out--as is already evident from the workings of the present Federal Energy Office-that the President already possesses the powers that it is feared will so strengthen the Executive Office. Last spring Congress renewed the Economic Stabilization Act, under which the President has since authorized the creation of the Federal Energy Office and assembled various energy functions. I favor passage of H.R. 11793 because it will enhance congressional control over the new FEA. If this bill becomes law, all the principal officers of the FEA will necessarily have to be confirmed by the Senate. Further, congressional approval will be mandated at the end of 2 years for any further energy regulation and policymaking vehicle. The interim period will have afforded all of us in this body and in the other House the opportunity to appraise the benefits and drawbacks of this agency. At that point, we will be able to act on information our own senses have gathered. Despite my endorsement of this legislation, I am troubled in particular by one aspect of this bill and its near relation, the conference report on the Energy Emergency Act <S. 2589). Neither piece of legislation takes, to my mind, a firm enough stand upon perhaps the most crucial issue raised by the national energy crisis. Quite simply, where are our national priorities? Do they lie with some ill-conceived, vague entity-the marketplace-or do they have their foundation in the wellbeing of our people? It seems to me that the most dangerous and insidious issue amidst this whole energy debate is the view, quite openly stated and restated by top administration figures, including Mr. Simon, that 1f prices go high enough demand will eventually mesh with supply and presto, no more shortages. This philosophy seems to me to ignore the fact that energy-whether it be used to heat homes, carry people to work or school or run factories--is not some imaginary commodity in an economics textbook.

            "204": "what has been used as alleged proof that the crisis was contrived by the oil companies. In fact, there was nothing sudden about it. Fifteen years ago a presidential commission warned that demand would soon outpace supply unless countermeasures were taken, but the report was ignored, as were the increasingly .frequent and increasingly urgent warnings by experts in industry and the universities. The present Administration is now being berated for not having foreseen the crisis, and while it is true that it could have done more, it has a better record in this respect than all of its predecessors. By April 1973, it had progressed from general warnings to submitting 18 specific proposals to Congress, including reevaluation of the price controls on gas and oil. But Congress ignored the proposals; by March 1974 it had acted on only one of them (the Alaska pipeline bill), and that only a.fter the Arab oil embargo, wate\u00b7rgating away precious months. A look through the trade journals of the petroleum industry and of the electric utilities for the last few years will soon dispel any suspicions that the arrival of the energy crisis was sudden. The warnings from industry (but not its PR departments) and from the universities were frequent and urgent. But nobody listened. There were other warnings, too. The long lines of cars now waiting their turn at the gas pumps in some metropolitan areas were commonplace in Denver, Colo., and Portland, Ore., in the summer of 1973. To say that the energy crisis erupted suddenly is like looking at a man who has fallen to his death from a skyscraper and saying \"How strange! The man was in perfectly good health when he fell past the fifth floor, and now all of a sudden he is dead.\" But, of course, energy production in the .United States is not dead, and that is another point that is overlooked in the \"why so sudden\" question placed at the door of the oil companies. Block-long lines at gas pumps do not start only when all the gas is gone; they ' start when the supply is down by as little as 10 percent. The cross-over point from enough to insufficient is indeed a \"sudden\" one. It so happened that the Arab embargo made that point appear dramatically in the fal~ of 1973; but without the embargo that point would have been reached a little later anyway. The present shortage is more serious than was foreseen by government spokesmen immediately after the Arab embargo, when it was pointed out that direct imports of Arab crude amounted only to 5 percent of total U.S. consumption. When imports of refined products and other dislocations were considered, the forecast quickly rose to between 17 per cent and 21 per cent. Moreover, this represented only the immediate shortage for the present winter. The real crunch will very likely appear as a gasoline shortage in the spring of this year, since refineries were ordered to produce 15 to 20 per cent more heating oil at the expense of gasoline during the winter. The usual latitude for changes in the fraction of gasoline production is only 5 per cent, and this disruption may show up as an additional factor in the shortage. When demand goes up this spring and summer, a refinery capacity shortage of some two million barrels per day (b/d) will probably show up as well. On the other hand, the embargo proved far less effective than anticipated, partly thanks to the oil companies who switched deliveries from non-Arab countries to Holland and the United States and delivered Arab oil to \"Arab-friendly\" countries, often by radio message to tankers already bound for a different destination. More important, the considerable waste of energy, engendered by its artificial cheapness through price controls, will cushion the increasing crunch as this waste is progressively eliminated. There is quite a way to go before ",

The simplest device that might serve to introduce an element of collective judgment into the exercise of executive power may be the one by which the executive in a parliamentary system is controlled. That is the device of dismissal of a government through a parliamentary vote of \"no confidence,\" which could be added to the American system by a simple constitutional amendment. This provision would have both a direct and an indirect effect. The direct effect would be to make possible the removal of a President who, though not guilty of the provable \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" that are the basis for impeachment, has lost the capacity to lead and inspire and unify the countryin short, the capacity to govern. On more than one occasion in the past, a President whose effectiveness had been destroyed through incompetence, gross negligence, egregious errors in foreign or domestic policy, or crimes and misdemeanors committed by those who had intimately shared his confidence and acted in his name, has remained in office until the end of his allotted four years-and nothing could be done about it. No other democratic government leaves itself so vulnerable.

It would be just another commit\u00b7 tee assignment for a member-just another chore, another burden-and not one of his most important committee assignments. Third, the amendment would preclude the development of long-term personal relations with members of the new committee and the other standing commit\u00b7 tees whose legislative work would have to be coordinated with the new budget committee. The Finance Committee has a long his\u00b7 tory, and the Appropriations Committee has a history which goes back deep into the roots of this institution. They both have great stature. The members of these committees, because of their seniority on such committees, generally, not only have great stature within the committee structure but also within the Senate. If we are going to set up a committee now that rotates its membership, its mem\u00b7 bers will be deprived of the opportunity to gain valuable experience and would not be as dedicated in their service to that committee, because of that fact, nor be able to accumulate the expertise in their field, which all members of other committees are able to gain with long and continuous service. I am afraid that they will not then have the prestige that will enable them to act with the kind of comity that will be needed between the budget committee and the Appropriations and Finance Committees, if we are going to make this legislation work. The members of the Appropriations and Finance and other committees may otherwise view those who will be work\u00b7 ing on the Budget Committee as ju.st messing into the business of the Appro\u00b7 priations and Finance and other com\u00b7 mittees. It will damage chances of favorable implementation of this act, once it becomes law. Finally, I do not believe we should veer away from the normal procedure governing the service on standing com\u00b7 mi ttees in this body. If this is really going to be a major standing committee, then it should stand on an equal basis with all other such standing committees, and its members should understand that.

We are all accustomed to having our egos trampled, of course, but that does not mean we should do honor to the tramplers. Archer Fullingim, though, is a far cry from your standard, run-of-the-mill ego-trampler. For 22 years now, Archer has been putting out a little weekly paper in a little town named Kountze, and there probably has not been a year when he could not count almost as many libel suits as paid advertisers. That does not mean he is irresponsible or unfriendly or anything; he just believes in getting things off his chest and letting you know whose newspaper it is you are reading. That the Kountze News belongs to Archer is a fact nobody has ever seen fit to challenge. He turns it out every Tuesday on a cranky, wheezY old flatbed press that looks like something Gutenberg improved on, talking to it and tinkering with it till it agrees to meet him halfway. In the process, that old press gets two things from Archer that no Texas politician in the last 22 years has been able to get: flattery and compromise. In between his various cantankerous campaigns and crusades, Archer has found time for his other interests as well. He is a yarn-spinner and shirt-cuff raconteur without par, and he makes something called Mayhaw Jelly that you would swear was a collaborative effort between Mother Nature and Sardi's. Archer has also fallen in love with the pine bogs and backwoods of the Big Thicket Wilderness, and he will tell you with a straight face that he can talk to the trees. And you cannot help but believe him. He looks like he probably can, tall and angular and all, about as gnarled and ageless as some king cypress hidden off in a timeless corner of the thicket wilds. At any rate, Archer has decided to quit the newspaper business. That is probably going to make the world safer for a lot ",
            "954": "Total costs for the whole program could run as high as $360 million per year, according to Vogely, if fuel prices reverted to levels when there was no embargo. If prices sta-yed high, government costs would be lower because private buyers would be competin;s for the fuel. \"Our position is that Project Independence must be defined as a program and not an idea. Interior is going to play a very major role in this,\" Vogely added. According to Robert Shatz, a former aerospace engineer working under Simon at the Federal Energy Office, there are now \"seven or eight\" different scenarios under study. Shatz' office, picking the best elements from each, expects to deliver a final draft of Project Independence to Simon within three months. Shatz said he has a task force studying various subsidy proposals, but has no firm estimate on how much such a program would cost taxpayers. Even if it cost $10 billion a year, he pointed out, the only alternative would be to buy increasingly larger volume of imported fuel at \"several times\" that cost. The big numbers now being uttered around Washington have amazed some industry experts, men who have watched the coal industry languish for years. \"There are going to be large winners and big losers in this. The political forces now working in this thing are enormous,\" said one man involved in the decision-making. Some of the potential \"winners,\" however, are not so sure. \"Up to now, all I am getting from the government is rhetoric,\" complains Carl E. Bagge, who as president of the Natio~al Coal Association is the coal industry's chief lobbyist. Bagge admits that one of the reasons federal subsidies are needed now that the coal industry, over the years, has contributed very little toward research and development. But coal, he argues, has been the \"redheaded stepchild of the energy business,\" the chief victim of government tax breaks favoring oil and pollution controls. \"Only five of the top 15 guys (coal companies) made a profit in 1973,\" he asserts. The continuing slump in coal development also has been reflected by a lack of interest in the nation's mining schools. There were only 200 mining engineers graduated last year, according to Bagge, \"a drop in the bucket\" compared with demands envisioned by Project Independence. \"If we ever get going, the industry would gobble up these guys overnight.\" Then there is the identity crisis the coal industry has. Of the top 10 coal production companies, the biggest is owned by a copper company, two are owned by steel companies, three are owned by oil companies and the rest are controlled by diversified conglomerates with interests far beyond the coal industry. Major newcomers to the industry, now competing for coal lands in the West, include several more oil companies, gas companies and giants from the electric utility industry. \"In a way, it's mind-boggling to ask us to move together,\" Bagge adds. \"All this stuff that the public is being mesmerized with now. Liquefaction and gasification. You're not going to solve the problem by throwing billions into coal research and development overnight. Behind all of that there has to be an economically viable industry.\" Bagge's solution is to have Congress pass a package of legislation guaranteeing coal's long-term stature as the nation's \"mother fuel.\" Included would be permission for widescale strip mining in the West and a longterm relaxation of air pollution controls that inhibit the burning of coal by electric utilities in the East. So far, despite vigorous verbal pressure from Simon and other government officials, even utilities that can burn coal have re-",

            "1154": "Fourth, contrary to the premature obituaries being offered, public financing is not a nail in the coffin of the two-party system in America. It will not diminish in any substantial way the role of political parties in the Nation. To the extent that public funds go to candidates themselves instead of to the parties, the Senate bill simply reflects the existing reality of campaign spending, in which the role of the candidate is and must be paramount. Congress settled this issue in 1967 and ratified it again in 1971, and that is where it rests today. In two of its provisions, moreover, the Senate bill specifically enhances the parties' role: By conferring independent spending authority on party committees at the National and State level, over and above the candidates' own spending limits, the bill establishes a specific role for the parties in their own right, free of the candidates' control. And, by prohibiting expenditures over $1,000 by a candidate for President unless the expenditure has the approval of the party's national committee, the bill guarantees a substantial supporting role for the parties in the national campaigns. On balance, therefore, far from damaging the parties, the prospects are good that public :financing will in fact be a useful counterbalance to the forces driving the two-party system apart and splintering modern politics. Realistically, public financing by itself is not a lever strong enough to rejuvenate the political parties in America. But if that is the direction in which the larger political and social forces now at work are moving, then public financing will contribute significantly to the goal. ",

Green Thumb meant a new life to him. It gave him independence in himself that he had never been able to express before. He was so proud of his work, his men, and the job that they were Cl.oing together. He enjoyed the respons llity of his paper work and this gave hini self confidence when he realized that he could do it and was doing a good job. It was the first time in his life that his job was something special and people looked up to him for supervision. He was most proud that he was chosen to be foreman and he enjoyed working with his crew of men and they were so special to him. He was an intelligent and alert man and Green, Thumb gave him a chance to prove this to himself and others. After working with the Green Thumb Project it was the first time he had been completely out of debt: He was able to save toward fixing up their home {which they had lived in for over 40 years). He and some of his sons were able to lay cement sidewalks all around their home and this was something that they had wanted for some time. They were able to buy some nice new modern chairs for their living room and at the time of his passing plans were being made by\u00b7 he and his wife to carpet and wallpaper some of the rooms in their home. Christmas of 1972 was the first time that he and his wife were able to save enough tnoney so that they could give ChriStmas presents to ALL of their family. What a thrill it was for them to give five dollar bills to each of their children and their spou-ses (J.6 total), silver dollars to each grandchild total), and silver dollars to each great grandchild ( 6 total) . December 20, 1972, our parents celebrated their 50th Wedding Anniversary. Daddy had saved the money and for Mother's ann!ver\u00b7 sary gift gave her 'fifty dollars.

He was able to save some from each of his checks and had a sizeable savings account for the first time in his lii'e. He felt this was. a very good insurance to have this saved for a rainy day .. It was a big load lifted from his and his Wife's shoulders when they knew that there was a regular income check coming in each month. Our father was a kind and gentle man who had been poor and hard working all of his life. It was only after he started with the Green Thumb Project and had the financial load lifted that he had time to sit and visit with his friends and loved ones and enjoy life. . It made him so proud when he could go wlth friends or family and show them some of the accomplishments that he and his crew of Green Thumbers had accomplished.

What a wonderful program for older men to work in who would otherwise think they had no meaning, place, or purpose in life.

'It must be extremely serious.' \"But, he said he doesn't feel the constitutional statement that the President can only be impeached and convicted for 'treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdeme.anors' means that impeachable offenses are limited to 'crimes.' \"'We feel it extends to serious abuses and offenses against the system of government in the United States of America,' Jenner said. \"Impeachment is an inquiry, not a trial, he told the students. 'It is a political function given solely to the House and . . . (by implication) gives the right to exercise any power to obtain information the House feels necessary to carry out the inquiry.' \" 'This is a Grand Inquiry, with a capital G and I,' Jenner said.

I not only object to his improper remarks in violation of our instructions and the Committee's rules, but also the fact that he has missed important committee meetings and Republican caucuses, apparently because he was out of the city making speeches.

            "104": "The Food for Peace program must be drastically restructured in South Vietnam and Cambodia to prevent its continued use by the Administration for \"security considerations\" in both countries. The Ti tie I sales program should be sharply reduced, if not suspended, in conjunction with a general suspension of nonhumanitarian U.S. aid to any party in South Vietnam who fails to act in accordance with the provisions of the Paris Agreement. Until peace is restored in South Vietnam and Cambodia the United States will find itself being relied upon to ship huge amounts of grains and other commodities to Indochina while shortages and rising prices prevail at home. The Food for Peace program has no country-by-country ceilings. There is nothing to prevent the Administration from diverting huge amounts of PL 480 commodities from other parts of the world to Indochina this next year, as they did in fiscal year 1974. It is imperative that Congress impose a ceiling on the total amount of Food for Peace commodities that may be obligated for South Vietnam and Cambodia during the next fiscal year. The refugees, the unemployed and the under-employed who most need the PL 480 foodstuffs do not have the money with which to buy them. The free-market system in South Vietnam today is not functioning efficiently and is not distributing PL 480 commodities to those in need. In South Vietnam today there is actually an excess of rice in the Thieu government's warehouses and open talk of exporting as much as 50,-000 metric tons. A rather sizeable pipeline of undelivered commodities exists. This results in part from the Administration's rush to get the maximum number of agreements signed before the July 1 prohibition on common defense use of PL 480-generated currencies became effective. When all parties in Indochina begin to act in accordance with the provisions of the Paris Agreement, Congress should re-examine the Title I program in South Vietnam and Cambodia in an attempt to determine if the Title I program is the best way to distribute PL 480 commodities to those in need. The advent of peace and the subsequent return of the refugees to their homes and farm lands should within a. year put both South Vietnam and Cambodia on the road to self-sufficiency in terms of foodstuffs and thus will free limited PL 480 commodities for use in other areas of the world where the demand is caused by a calamity of nature, rather than by a political conflict. To meet the immediate needs of South Vietnam's and Cambodia's people the Title II grant program should be increased and some mechanism developed utilizing voluntary agencies and multilateral organizations, that will distribute the commodities to those most in need, especially refugees. But this program need by of only short duration, for soon after they leave the refugee and \"resettlement\" camps and return to their homes the refugees will again become productive members of the society and will start providing their own food. The world is experiencing a severe food shortage in the less-developed countries.

That program turned out hundreds of thousands of doctors, lawyers, and specialized professionals who\u00b7 have returned the investment made in them many times over in their contributions to society in general and through their increased earning power in particular. The second argument is as simple as the size of the overbloated military buctg .. et for the coming fiscal year. Secretary of Defense Schlesinger admitted in front of two separate congressional committees that the military budget requests were padded to the tune of between $2 and $5 billion in an effort to stave off the threat of increased unemployment and a possible recession. Not only is that bad military strategy, Mr. President, that is bad economics. We have an inflation problem, and military spending is among the most inflationary kinds of spending there is. It must be obvious to anyone with an elementary understanding of economics and an appreciation for what the World War II GI program accomplished that the money would be much better invested in the education and training of our young veterans. Rather than pouring our dollars into wasteful arms projects, we should be arming the Vietnam veteran with a diploma or vocational training. That is the kind of investment in America that we can see grow and produce results that will match our internal economic strength against our military might. Mr. President, it is almost exactly 1 year to the day since I introduced the first set of GI bill amendments in the 93d Congress.

The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee led by Senator HARTKE has come forth with their own very worthy bill. We have all worked hard and we are now close to passing landmark legislation that could finally bring justice to millions of young veterans who have known nothing but neglect and injustice since their time of service. It would be unfair and highly irregular for the House to expect the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee to meet in conference over an omnibus GI bill when the full Senate has only acted on the 2-year extension. It would be unfair to over a quarter of a million young veterans to tie up the simple 2-year extension provided by S. 3398 in a mangle of parliamentary bickering and political logrolling.

And he said that one problem in dealing with him was that every point he makes is accompanied by a story, and that latter is so. P. He probably foxed him. Well, then maybe all I'll do w1 th Petersen-he said that he'd give me 12 hours notice With regard to the Magruder thing and I think I want that. H. Yeah. P. Bill doesn't know how procedure works---E. Let me tell you what that procedure is. Wilson explained that to us too. He said that where a man goes in on an information and pleads guilty in this District, it is customary for the judge to interrogate if he Wishes to. And also for there to be filed a statement of the case-ah-in the nature of information. Now the information which they wm file instead of indictment names the co-conspirators in the conspiracy charge who are not indicted. E. That does not mean that you won't be indicted later. It means for the purpose of that information which is then filed, you are not indicted. And so this is a list of people who in a description of a conspiracy pattern are co-conspirators. His analysis of the pros and cons of this are that for the prosecutor to come forward and say, \"If you will suspend these birds, I will name them in the list of co-conspirators,\" gets the prosecutor off a. difficult political hook because when the judge asks, \"Were there any other co-conspirators and so on?\" He says, \"Well, they have already been suspended-ah, and may be indicted.\" We reserve the right to indict them but we are going to have them before the Grand Jury. R. So, are they going to help a bit? E. Well, it doesn't help us. It helps the prosecutor with his problem. On the other hand, he says, there is a certain negative in it. From a political standpoint for the Ad\u00b7 ministration in that the question will arise, \"Well, why weren't their names on there if they're co-conspirators?\" P. Right. E. Somebody's covered up. R. Yes. H. That's worse than putting them on the list. E. Yeah, and so, he said-R. I don't know, John. And let me go back for just a moment on this procedure. The information is filed by the prosecutor himself, without a Grand Jury action? H. Yeah. ",

Our position of support for the countries of OPEP, although it is costly to us, is based on the assurance that they will make common cause in our struggles, as the American chancellors did recently in Washington, when a badly informed group of North Americ\u2022an workers opposed the aspirations of peoples that have made possible-to a lesser or greater extent-the wellbeing they enjoy. This same feeling of solidarity compelled the Foreign Ministers of La tin America to proclaim in Bogota, in Tlatelolco and in Washington, their support to the Republic of Panama in its struggle to\u00b7 reconquer its full sovereignty over the Canal Zone, and to negotiate with the United States a fairer Canal Treaty. I wholeheartedly support the proposition made by President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela in his Inaugural Address when he stated: \"it would be a great homage to the Fathers of Latin American Independence that this Panamanian claim could be achieved and celebrated on the next 7th of December, when we shall commemorate the 150th Anniversary of the Congress of Panama\". In this struggle, since 1950, Mr. Jose Figueres, the former President, has stood out more than anybody else. Costa Rica and the developing countries recognize that it was he who started the struggle for fair international prices, with his letter of that year to the FAO Conference in New Delhi. The struggle has already taken a worldwide turn. Oil producers joined under OPEP and have shown their strength. Bauxite producers joined in Conakry and a struggle has started to organize and to improve international conditions and prices of aluminum. Next came coffee, cacao and sugar. In New York, the countries of the third world managed to ca.ll a Special Meeting of the UNO to set up the bases for a fairer international economy. The Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of the States, proposed by the President of Mexico, Lie. Luis Echeverria, continues to be our goal. Ex-President Jose Figueres must continue in that struggle. As soon as I set up my Government, I will ask him to give a few more years to Costa Rica and to the world, in the struggle for an international system for justice and social improvement, the only basis on which worldwide peace can be built. As the Representative of the President of the Republic of Costa Rica, and by his own worth, Ex-President Figueres will be able to carry forward, at world forums and conferences, a banner that he has carried, witl1 foresight and valor, for a quarter of a century. The society of the future, the shaping of which will be a permanent effort of my Government, cannot be based on national efforts that will only serve a few, or that will consolidate unfair social systems. We have a long way to go to attain a harmonious development: man, land, capital and culture must go hand in hand, or the inequalities of growth will inevitably bring the explosions of change. It is not fair that, in the Costa Rica of today, there should be a palace alongside of a shock. This is an invitation to those who have nothing, to take justice into their own hands. Costa Rica has no right to have palaces, nor is it fair that those who have a fortune through the efforts of all, should make aggressive ostentation of their opulence. The entire political and fiscal system of the Nation must be aimed at having accumulated income reinvested so as to create more work and more wealth, and to pave the way ",

Let us remember that the global figures taken here, by eliminating the two gifted provisions-parts B and C-relating to incentives to the States to do better in education and the unusually high concentration of lowincome children, are eliminated so that the global sum used in the McClellan amendment becomes a greater sum. Certainly, no matter how we slice it, the individual amount distributable under that formula would appear to be greater. The figures are given by States, but the money is not distributed by States. This is the key fallacy which I hope the Senate will carefully scrutinize. The money is not distributed by States but by local educational districts. So the State may, in a global sense, look good, but the State is not the entity that gets the money. The entity that gets the money is the local educational district. When we break that down into local educational districts, according to the formula proposed by the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. McCLELLAN), we find that 600 counties out of some counties in the Nation will receive less in :fiscal year 1975 than in the current fiscal year. This, to me, is the real nail that should be driven into the internment of the McClellan amendment, the point about the populations. We are talking about people, the population of those 600 counties as compared with the population of the other 2,400. That will give us a real measm\u00b7e of what this means. The 600 counties are disadvantaged. They include the primary metropolitan areas of the country. This country is no longer rural. Seventy-five percent of our people live in urban areas. Practically every State has .an important metropolitan area. So those are the very key reasons why such diverse entities as the American Federation of Labor, the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and the United Automobile Workers of America, all espouse the committee's formula, because taking everything together it did the best justice. In addition, it obeyed and conformed to the tradition which we have established, because of the shifting nature of the formula bases, the tradition of a hold-harmless formula based on the preceding year. Finally-and we shall have more time to debate this, I do not want to take more than the time allotted to me at this moment-there is one more critically important fact that I should like to point out. It is a very popular sport, Mr. President, on the floor of the Senate-and I have been here .a considerable time and I have heard it countless times and have seen the game played time and time and time again-to point the finger at New York. Look at ~ew York. Look at what has happened in New York. Look at what New York is getting. When we do that, let us remember that no matter what we do, New York is the State that will always be ahead. Take the McClellan formula or any other formula and New York will still get a lot of money. The McClellan formula gives New York the most of any State. It gives New York ",

Mr. Speaker, on Thursday evening, May 23, at Lococo's Restaurant in Manhattan Beach, a testimonial dinner will be held for my friend, Gayle Martin, the city manager of Manhattan Beach. Gayle Martin was born in Alva, Okla., and grew up in western Colorado where he attended grade school and high school. He attended the University of Colorado where he received a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1940. He later attended the University of Michigan under a Navy postgraduate program studying naval architecture. He received his M.S. degree in public administration from the University of Denver in 1952. Mr. Martin started his professional career as an engineer with the Babcock & Wilcox Co., where he worked until entering the Navy in 1942. He received a direct commission as an ensign and reported for active duty in September 1942. He served on active duty in a number of assignments until September 1949, when he returned to inactive duty only to be recalled to active duty for the Korean war to serve until June 1952. While on active duty Mr. Martin rose to the rank of lieutenant commander. After his release to inactive duty he remained active in the Naval Reserve and progressed rapidly in rank with his military career being climaxed by his selection as a rear admiral in February 1968. Admiral Martin maintained a very active status in the Naval Reserve until his retirement on June 30, 1973, culminated 31 years of duty with the NavY. Mr. Martin's career in city management started in Phoenix, Ariz., where he took a 1-year internship in city management in the office of the city manager. His first appointment as a city manager came in November 1952, in Deerfield, Ill. In 1954 he became manager at Maywood, Ill., and in November 1956, he was appointed as city manager in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where he has served for the last 1 7 % years. ",
            "854": "DEAR MR. KOCH: Thank you for your letter of April 4, 1974, concerning EPA action against pesticide products containing vinyl chloride as an aerosol propellant. As you may know, on April 24, I did sus\u00b7 pend the registrations of pesticide products containing vinyl chloride .as a propellant which were registered for indoor. use. The suspension order, which went into effect -immediately, prohibits the further distribution, sale, or use of the affected products. At the same time, I requested that all existing stocks of these products be recalled. You ask why the issuance of such an or\u00b7 der was delayed, and why the Agency, at least for a. time, sought voluntary action to pre\u00b7 vent further sale of the product. The issuance of a. suspension order must be predicated upon a determination that such action is necessary to prevent a.n imminent hazard during the time required for cancellation (Section 6(c) (1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act). At the time of our first news release requesting voluntary recall of products by the manufacturers, data. concerning the extent and duration of the exposure which could result from the use of such aerosol pesticide products was lacking. The other human and experimental data available to the Agency linked exposure to vinyl chloride gas and angiosarcoma of the liver only after substantial repeated and continued exposure. The finding of an imminent hazard, then, would have been tenuously based at best. Since that first press announcement on April 17, however, preliminary EPA tests have indicated that during a typical spray of a vinyl chloride-containing aerosol, the user could be exposed to significant levels of the gas. The tests and subsequent calculations further indicated that residues of the gas could remain in an enclosed area for some period of time, albeit at lower levels. The results of these experiments, coupled with additional results from animal tests, made the case for suspension of these products considerably stronger. I should emphasize, though that we are stm uncertain as to the health risks associated with the short term exposure to vinyl chloride gas such as is produced by the use of an aerosol pesticide prod\u00b7 uct. As I stated in the suspension order, however, based on the newly acquired test results, \"it is prudent to assume that any exposure at these levels will have increased the risk of cancer should the strongly suspected causal relationship between vinyl chloride and cancer be finally confirmed\". I enclose a copy of the order itself, and copies of our two press releases on vinyl chloride actions. As to general action taken by the Agency with respect to vinyl chloride, I established a Task Force on February 14, 1974, under the direction of the Director of the Office of Toxic Substances, to examine the broader issue, including air and effluent emission standards. I enclose a copy of the press release outlining the operation of the Task Force. We are now collecting and monitoring data and other in4 formation which wm enable us to evaluate the need :for further action under the other authorities of the Agency. We appreciate your interest in the vinyl chloride issue, and assure you that we share your concern for the safety of the consumer. Please let me know if I may provide further information.

Mr. Speaker, on April 16, 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in Arnett against Kennedy. It is but the latest in a line of cases dealing with the problem of termination or suspension of Federal employees in the competitive service. These cases are noted primarily for their failure to answer the important and ultimate question whether Federal employees have a protected right to their jobs after completing the probationary period, that is, whether they can be terminated or suspended without a prior hearing on the merits. The opinion in Arnett against Kennedy is similarly ambiguous on the question and offers little hope for a person looking for a clear statement of his rights. The courts are not entirely to blame. The law is unclear because Congress has not acted unequivocally regarding pretermination hearings. There is no statute which clearly mandates executive agencies to promulgate uniform regulations in the area. The law as it now stands leaves the whole matter of pretermination hearings for Federal employees up in the air and opens the door to agency abuse of employees who in good conscience criticize agency procedures or disclose agency wrongs and coverups. There are well known cases: for instance, those of Ernest Fitzgerald and Gordon Rule, employees of the Federal Government who have spoken out, been fired, and eventually won their rights to back pay and reinstatement. These cases, however, have involved employees in difficult fights and drawn out period without pay. Some agencies grant pretermination hearings; but many others do not. In those an employee must suffer without pay while he is waiting to be heard. For sure, our veterans now have a preference right to a hearing before termination, and some Federal employees, through contract, have a similar right. Many others, though, are without this fundamental protection. Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I am today introducing a bill called the Federal Employee Administrative Hearing Rights Guarantee Act. The purpose of this legislation is to guarantee all employees in the competitive service a prompt evidentiary hearing by an impartial individual prior to the time that removal or suspension without pay is effective. The bill declares that certain minimum protections are due such an employee before termination or suspension, among them, the right to see the evidence supporting the action and to have a transcript of the proceedings_ I share the opinion of the many unions representing Federal employees who have contacted me--among them the National Treasury Employees Union and the Overseas Education Association-that it is time for congressional action on this problem.

Under the amendment, a school could also become eligible if at least 10 percent of its current undergraduate student body is composed of such GI Bill trainees. The new 10-percent requirement in the amendment would still impose a substantial requirement on an individual institution since the national average GI Bill trainee enrollment for universities, colleges, and community colleges is 8.7 percent. Preliminary figures indicate that this new clause will alleviate the inadvertent inequity of the present 10-percent-GI-Bill-trainee-increase requirement for a number of schools which have already made impressive achievements in enrolling returning veterans. It should be noted that mere numbers of GI Bill trainees would still not be enough to qualify for a VCI grant; under the law, a school must also establish and carry out significant special veterans programs, including a veterans affairs office, a veterans tutorial program, a veterans PREP or college prepatory program, and a veterans work/study outreach program. These requirements would not be affected by the amendment. A sample of schools in areas with about 25 percent of the Nation's population shows that of 1,296 schools surveyed, only 299, or 23 per cent, increased their GI Bill trainee enrollment in March 1973 by 10 percent over March 1972; 997 schools, or 76 percent, did not meet the 10-percent requirement, although of this 997, 134, or 13.4 percent, did show some increase in GI Bill trainee enroUment. Section 420(d) would be amended by providing a more equitable funding procedure for all eligible schools. The law presently requires the Commissioner to pay to each institution of higher education which has had an application approved under subsection ( c) of section 420, the amount to which it is entitled under this section. Any in\u00b7 stitution meeting the requirement of the law is entitled to payments of up to $450 for each of certain categories of veterans enrolled in an undergraduate program on a full-time basis or who have, in prior academic years, been enrolled in certain special veterans education programs under the GI Bill. Although VCI programs have been successfully implemented at many institutions of higher education across the country, the limited funds which the Office of Education has m.ade available and certain provisions of the law have made it particularly difficult for many smaller colleges to establish programs which meet all the requirements of the law. The funding procedure established by this amendment, which adds a second sentence in subsection (d), would limit to $135,000 the maximum amount of payments 1n any fiscal year to any institution, or any branch of such institution located in a community different from that in which its parent institution is located. Reports received from schools which received VCI funding for this year led to the conclusion that even large schools with large numbers of veterans would be able to establish, and had, in fact, successfully operated, VCI programs utilizing about $100,000 of their VCI grants. Only 14 schools across the country received initial grnnts for academic yeal 1973-1974 of more than $135,000. Section 420 ( d) would be further amended by adding a new third sentence which would provide that, in making payments under section 420 in any fl.seal year, the Commissioner is required to apportion the funds which become available as a result of the new $135,-000 institutional payment limitation in such a manner as will result, first, in the receipt by each eligible institution of a total payment of at least $9,000 (or the amount of its entitlement for that fiscal year, whichever is less) and, then, additional amounts distributed to all eligible institutions up to the $136,000 maximum.

It is quite inaccurate to suggest that this study was slanted or in any way deficient in its analysis of the current situation in the world and in our nation regarding the impact of the metric system on our economy and our society. The report suggests the urgent need for adopting some reasonable means for a changeover to the International Metric System. Indeed, the first recommendation was the simple and straightforward statement that \"the U.S. change to the International Metric System deliberately and carefully.\" Now, along with other recommendations, the report recommended that any changeover costs shall \"lie where they fall.\" Indeed, it was stated flatly that this would encourage efficiency and minimize the overall cost to society. The report called for a coordinated national program. As many of you know, I have endeavored to carry out these recommendations consistent with the conversion to metric measurements, which is occurring in this countrysteadily and rapidly, even-without any legislative mechanism whatever. The great volume of literature on the issue takes account of the rapid movement toward the metric system in our schools, in our industry, and in our daily lives. When street signs report automobile speeds and distances in terms of kilometers, when skis, cameras, film, eyeglasses, pharmaceuticals, sporting events, and contents of packages on grocery store shelves are labeled in terms of metric weights and measures, we are well on the road toward a comprehensive changeover to metric measurements. What is truly astounding is that voices that purport to speak in behalf of millions of Americans in business and labor have made grossly exaggerated estimates of costs and have asserted their special interests in seeking to defeat legislation intended to aid all Americans. It ha.s never been my view that the Federal government should compel conversion to the metric system. On the other hand, it would seem to be one of the most appropriate functions of the Federal government to provide either the mechanism or the vehicle by which the private and public sectors of our nation might voluntarily-and in an orderly and coordinated and deliberate way-proceed with a comprehensive metric conversion program. My individual position and that of some 25 or so of my colleagues as embodied in H.R. 10720, would have established a metric conversion board small in number with rather broad authority to work with advisory groups and private trade associations and others to help coordinate their individual conversion programs. But from the outset-and particularly in some parts of the 1972 legislative proposal-there were provisions for large-scale Federal subsidies, grants and loans and other provisions quite inconsistent with a voluntary program in which the costs are supposed to \"lie where they fall.\" It may be that a certain amount of the momentum, which developed after the metric study report was issued in July, 1971, was lost during the period-between then and now. During the intervening period, organized labor interests--and private interests involving some industry-have developed their own ideas in connection with the form and scope of Federal Government involvement in the changeover to metric standards. The size of the proposed metric conversion board has been expanded, delays involving development of some kind of comprehensive plan have been embraced by a great many proponents of this legislation, and provisions have been added to require future legislative, as well as executive action in order to implement any program whatever. It would be very easy today to lay the entire blame on organized labor for the dis-"

Instead of having the energy appropriations spread through seven appropriation bills as would have been the normal procedure we would have only one comprehensive energy appropriation bill. We would bring them all together in one package and pass the appropriation prior to the beginning of the fiscal year July 1, 1974, in order that the various agencies and the departments of Government might proceed as rapidly and efficiently as possible with these energy programs.

But the tight military control that began in 1964 and was further intensified in late 1968 is without parallel in the country's history. Countering the repression has been one major force, the Roman Catholic church, which is increasingly at odds with the regime, and a broad range of other oppositionists of varying political hues. In a horrifying document, \"Report on Allegations of Torture in Brazil,\" Amnesty International detailed the findings of a 1972 inquiry. Names of 1081 reported victims and their 472 torturers are listed. Eyewitness accounts are given. Details of physical, psychological, and electronic torture are stated. Brazilian authorities replied by banning from the press all Amnesty International statements on Brazil. (Index magazine, published by Writers and Schol8irs International, has also documented the staggering facts of censorship and press control in Brazil.) Political prisoners in Brazil are mainly trade unionists, peasant leaders, university staff and students, journalists, progressive clergy, and politioians or military men who had supported the democratic regime, which was overthrown in 1964. It has been charged that the cle,rgy, after radical students, have been the major target of oppression and torture. Priests have been expelled or refused re-entry after foreign trips. others have been jailed. Some Catholic publications and radio stations have been closed down. An inspirational symbol of church resistance to the regime is Dom Helder Camara, archbishop of Olinda and Recife, several times a Nobel Prize nominee. The Archiblshop. is not permitted to speak publicly, and the press cannot report his activities. An asBif.stant of his was killed, apparently by righte:st vigilantes, in 1969. Last year a number of lay workers associated with Dom Helder were jailed and tortured.

However, 3 of the gambling bstallations, 1 drug and 2 others were from 20 to 29 days, and 3 installations were from 30 to 59 days. 2. State survelllance. a. Authorizations and installations. By December 31, 1969, some nine states had authorized use of wiretapping, thoug!l Massachusetts did not report any usage in 1969; the ether states were Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgh, Maryland. New .Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. The:e states obtained 269 authorizatiOI!S and made 260 installations; there were 189 ex ten >ions. Here agsin, the Admin. Off. Rep. has a muc':l lower figure for installations: again this is because the Administrative Office improperly considers installations for which there are no reports of conversations and persons overheard, as not installed. b. Offenses. The relative proportions begin slowly to move toward an lncrea!;e in gambling and a corresponding decrease in the re:;t, particularly drugs. The 1969 individual Appendix figures show the following: Authorizations: G, 79; D, 85; H, 19: K, 1; 0, 85; All, 269. Installations: G, 78; D, 80; H, 19; K, 1; 0, 82; All, 260. c. Place. Again, New York accounts for the bulk of the interceptions, this time with New Jersey a distant but clear second: 191 orders were granted in New York and 45 in New Jersey. Within New York, a preponderance in some areas appears again. This time, Queens had 51 orders and some 49 installations; Brooklyn and the Bronx dropped to 19 and 23 respectively, from the prior year's 68 and 33, even though the time period was twice as long. Elsewhere, Maryland had 15 orders and installations, Arizona had 8 orders of which at least 5 were installed, Georgia had 5 orders and at least 2 were installed, Colorado and Florida each had 2 orders and 2 and 1 installed, respectively. and Rhode Island had one. d. Persons. There is a very great disparity between the figures computed from the Appendix and those in the Admin. Off. Rep. The 1971 ACLU Report indicated that some 26,876 people were overheard-this is the difference between the average number of people overheard, multiplied by the total number of installations for all 1969 survemances ( 116 X 271 =31,436) less the federal average multiplied by the federal total ( 152 X 30 = 4,560) . But adding up the total of the individual reports in the Appendix produces only 8,590 for some 214 installations, or an average of only 40, not the 112 indicated in the Admin. Off. Rep. Even if the 40 1s extrapolated to all 260, the total is still only 10,400. Tbe 40 figure seems the more plausible, since the 1969 figure was only 25 and, as will be seen below, the 1970 and 1971 state figures from the Appendix are 43 and 34 respectively. and from the Admin. Office, 39 and 33 respectively. For this reason, the overall average for all installations is not likely to have been I 12, as the Admin. Off. Rep. indicates, but about 50. As a result, the original 1969 state figure in the ACLU report was overstated bv A.bout 16,000. The breakdown of averages of people over-heard per installation by offense is as follows: G, 48; D, 27; H, 16; K, 19; 0, 54. e. Conversations. Here, the Appendix and Admin. Off. figures are close. The Appendix figures show 1213.452 conversations in 228 installations, or an average of 555 per installation, broken down by offense as follows: G, 525; D, 405; H, 1,100; K, 21; 0, 615: All, 555.

            "454": "but, as he himself correctly says, \"the world economy in depression.\" The difference is important. Apart from the usual obligatory references to Hitler, and a passing remark about its effect in stimulating \"fifty revolutions in Latin America,\" there is little in Kindleberger's book to bring home to the reader the shattering political consequences of the Depression or its global impact.s His a ttl tude is rather like that of a general on a battlefield, unmoved by the carnage and destruction, thinking only of tactics and strategy. It would be a pity if this rather severely technical approach obscured the fact that the Depression was not just an unfortunate economic relapse, but also the solvent of the entire, admittedly fragile, existing international order. It was scarcely an accident of history that the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the first major break in the international structure established after 1918, occurred in 1931. Historians too often write as though Hitler, or Saito and Konoye, or Mussolini overthrew the existing status quo. In reality, they simply exploited the dislocation the Depression had created. And this also is not without modern connotations. If in 1930 the international order re-established after the First World War collapsed under the impact of the slump, by 1970 the new international order created by the United States after 1945 was visibly creaking at the joints. Already in the summer of 1968 one commentator announced that \"money pressure\" was \"forcing detente all over the world.\" 9 With the advent of Nixon the prediction was simply confirmed. The Guam doctrine, announced on July 25, 1969, and the Kissinger-Nixon visits to Peking and Moscow that followed, may not, as Rolfe and Burtle insist, have meant a \"retreat of American power,\" but they certainly indicated a major shift in world forces, and no one would deny that \"money pressure\"-in other words, a radical change in the economic climate, a downward swing in the Kondratieff cycle-was an operative factor. As Henry Brandon puts it, \"Shortage of money became one of the most potent American policy makers, just as its abundance had been a generation earlier.\" The broader effects of the Depression in the advanced industrial countries are too well known to need description; but their impact on existing ideologies was no less shattering. Above all, they drove home the lesson that unemployment on the scale of the 1930s must never be allowed to occur again. The classic remedy of massive deflation was out, and the maintenance of full employment became the central pillar of postwar economic policy, both domestic and international. This preoccupation with full employment was due to the \"gnawing fear\" (as The New York Times put it in 1946) that, once the postwar boom was over, \"the United States might run into something even graver than the Depression of the Thirties,\" with all its incalculable social and political possiblllties.1o Internationally, it translated into a fear \u2022'whether the American capitalist system could continue to function if most of Europe and Asia should abolish free enterprise,\" a determination \"to increase our outlets abroad for manufactured products,\" and an opposition to high tariffs, exclusive trading blocs, and unfair economic competition, which-as Cordell Hull, never tired of insisting-bred the war which broke out in the Far East in 1937, spread to Europe in 1939, and engulfed the United States in 1941. Considering the small part that foreign trade played (and stm plays) in the United States economy, this obsession with foreign markets is easier to explain on psychological than on rational grounds; but Dean Acheson was certainly expressing a prevalent view when he said: You don't have a problem of production.

These programs have, since their establishment in 1965, contributed greatly to the balanced economic development of areas with high structural unemployment and demonstrated need. The Public Works Subcommittee on Economic Development, of which I am a member, has heard testimony this spring from a wide range of witnesses-including Governors, mayors, Federal, State and local officials, and representatives from Indian tribes-almost uniformly in praise of the purposes of these programs and in support of their extension. I believe the broad support of this bill lies in the fact that approved projects are designed to attack the roots of unemployment through positive industrial development and job creation, rather than 'through lateral income transfer programs. The importance of these EDA programs can be demonstrated by the success of the Economic Resources Corporation in the development of the Watts Industrial Park in Los Angeles. ",

I know he would have enjoyed being here and seeing so many of his good friends and associates. You have heard several comments on how fortunate we all have \u00b7been to know him and what an inspiration he has been to us all in many ways. Now obviously there is very little I can add to what the previous speakers have said except on a personal basis. It was my good fortune to work with Win Riefler during the time that Tom McCabe has said was the most difficult time in the Federal Reserve's history-and I won't challenge that, although I'm sure it's had many difficult times and. wl:l have many more difficult times. But I give Win Riefler full credit for whatevel\" came out of the Treasury-Federal Reserve-. accord.

And in the sense that he was pursuing sound monetary policies, he was pursuing them with an understanding that unless we had sound money we would be servants and not masters of that money. This is something that all of us, I think, must recognize. The Federal Reserve System has been blessed with a great many competent peoplebut none more competent or more dedicated than Win Rieft.er, and he rendered a service which is recognized by this group here today and by many more who could not be her& today.

            "854": "peachable offenses. If the doctrine of executive privilege can validly be invoked against the House Judiciary Committee in its legitimate and constitutional function of seekng all information so that it can make an objective and fair and reasoned judgment as to whether or not impeachable offenses exist, then indeed any President, by simply invoking the socalled doctrine of executive privilege, can stop all such inquiry and bring it to a halt. In that way, he could nullify or negate the clause of the Constitution which provides for impeachment of the Chief Executive of this country. While I do not at this moment attempt to take any position with respect to specific requests on the part of the House Judiciary Committee, I do not think that a parallel can be drawn in respect to the House Judiciary Committee's constitutional function in this regard as against the rule that governs the submission of documents, and so forth, and the requiring of information on the part of Senate employees such as that embraced in the resolution I have submitted on behalf of Mr. EASTLAND. Nor would I, as a Senator, ever defend the Senate, nor do I think any Senator would defend the Senate, nor do I think the Senate as an institution would interpose the Senate rule, in resistance to the submission of valid, relevant evidence in the possession of the Senate, if that evidence llore upon the possible commission of a crime. Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I yield. Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. He has given the Senate very helpful leadership in this regard. He is absolutely 100 percent right with respect to executive privilege. I have in my hand a copy of the Constitution of the United States, and there is not one word in the Constitution about executive privilege. Indeed, one eminent historian has said that it was 1958 before the term was ever used. Raoul Berger, who is probably the most eminent expert in the world in this field, has argued that executive privilege is simply a matter of expedience. That makes sense. The Senator from Michigan has made a good point. We should not be able to take from the President of the United States any papers that may disclose national security matters of secrets of that kind. But this is a matter of convenience, a matter of commonsense, a matter of logic, not of absolute constitutional right. On the other hand, the House of Representatives has a constitutional responsibility with respect to impeachment. It is very clear in the Constitution. So for us to permit the Executive to interpose some new motion of executive privilege to frustrate the proper role of Congress to investigate, as we must do in order to fulfill our obligations, seems to me to be unconstitutional, unwise, and improper. Mr. President, one of the most vital functions that the Senate and the House have is the function of investigation, and by the President using this notion of executive privilege, that function has been frustrated and frustrated badly.

This, of course, is one of those things that I would have to predict will happen on this particular item. The question is, who is more right here or more wrong about the estimates? For years both the administration and the Congress have accepted the estimates of the 50 States which are made considerably in advance of the fiscal year. As the committee report notes, for 11 years in a row these State estimates were vastly underestimated and the Congress had to vote supplementals for those years. The fiscal year 1973 was a standoff year. The original estimates were reasonably accurate; however, the administration requested and the Congress passed a supplemental which prgved to be unnecessary. In the fiscal year 1974, for the first time the pendulum swung the other way and the estimates were vastly overstated. As a result, the administration recommended a rescission, a significant one, better than three-quarters of a billion dollars; but we in the Congress rescinded $1,188 million. Mr. Chairman, I am concerned that in the fiscal year 1974 the rescission was too sharp. HEW has already had to borrow over $100 million from their fiscal year 1975 appropriation,. which is not accounted for in our committee estimates. Second, the fiscal year 1974 estimates are based on the November 1973 State estimates, reduced by the administration by more than $500 million. The May 1974 State estimates are nearly $700 million higher than the State requests. If these State estimates are more correct than the House estimates, there could be a deficit of more than $1.5 billion. There is no certainty as to who is right about this thing. It is reasonably clear, however, that even if the trend is down, as it was in fiscal year 1974, our committee has cut too much. Members should assume that there is a due bill waiting in the wings in the form of a SUIPPlemental for public assistance which will almost certainly wipe out the margin shown in our committee report as being below the President's budget. That is the point I want to make, that we do not get carried away and think that we are in such good shape that when these amendments are offered-in one item to increase public service employment by $300 million-we take the optimistic view that all is well, because it is not all well. It is pretty bad and we ought to face up to the music.

Although I believe we should act promptly, a maximum 1-year delay in the operation of the automatic effective date, pursuant to sections 3771 and 3772 of title 18 of the United States Code, seems reasonable. Attorney General Saxbe strongly recommends this 1-year delay in these amendments. In a letter of June 17, 1974, he informed the Judiciary Committee he was offering objection on behalf of 90 of the 94 U.S. attorneys. The Attorney General specifically objects to the amendments to rules 4 and 9 regarding arrest warrants, and rule 16 regarding discovery motions.

Is it wise to require the Justice Department to disclose where that witness is being hidden? Whether it is or not, is a question, along with other questions raised by these amendments, which can only be answered after careful and comprehensive consideration by the Congress.

I believe that while, as a general approach, the committee bill is preferB.ible to the present Price-Anderson Act, there is now no pressing need to extend the act for as long a period as the committee has recommended. Indeed, I believe that there are compe111ng considerations for a shorter extension, which will be of no harm to the planning of the nuclear power industry wh1le at the same time allowing the Congress to evaluate both our long-term national energy policy and a long-awaited study on nuclear reactor safety. The two-year extension and modUlcat\\.on of Price-Anderson as proposed in the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Nelson), w111 protect the legitimate interests of the nuclear power industry and will not cause disruptions in the planning of nuclear fac111ties. Proof of this is ava1lable from the statements of the proponents of the ten-year extension. For example, Congressman Melvin Price, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, in the Congressional Record of June 13, stated that: \"There is a common misconception that since the Price-Anderson Act will not expire until 1977, there is no need for immediate action. This is not the case. Since the leadtimes for construction permits for nuclear powerplants range from 2 to 4 years, depending on a number of factors, uncertainty on extension of the Price-Anderson Act until mid-1975 could create a significant disrupti>on in ut111ty planning.\" And the Joint Committee, in its report on this legislation stated that: The Price-Anderson Act applies only to licenses issued prior to August, 1977. Nuclear power plants now in the planning and design phases would not receive construction permits until about 1977-1978. Thus there is uncertainty as to whether these plants would receive protection in the form of Government indemnity. Reactor manufacturers and architect-engineers are already requiring escape clauses in their contracts to permit cancellation in the event some form of protection from unlimited potential liability is not provided. Action is required soon to prevent disruption in ut111ty plans for nuclear power. In other words, proponents of this measure argue that there is a maximum fouryear lead time before the granting of a construction permit for a nuclear power plant fac111ty, at which time the protection of the Price-Anderson Act becomes operative. They further argue that we in the Congress must provide this four year lead-time in order not to impair the orderly growth of the nuclear power industry. The amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Nelson) would do precisely that. By extending the Act until August 1, 1979, the amendment would allow us to further examine the implications of the Price-Anderson Act next year, both in the light of our developing national energy policy, and the conclusions of the so-called Reactor Safety Study, which will shortly be issued in draft form. and which shoUld shed new light on the safety of nuclear power plant facllities. The Congress could then make a considered judgment by mid-1975 on the form and length of any long-term extension of the Act as might be required. In the interim, the nuclear power industry would be able to continue its planning unhampered, safe in the knowledge that the Act will continue until mid-1979, or more than the four year lead time which the proponents of this measure claim ts necessary.

The parties belong to the people. The parties have been free of the Government. Here, unless we adopt my amendment, we are now attaching them to the bureaucracy. vve would be making them a part of the official Government establishment. VVe would be, in fact, nationalizing the political parties of this great country. Therefore, I believe that it is absolutely essential that this portion be stricken from the bill. I hope the Committee will support my amendment, Mr. Chairman. Mr. BRADEMAS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman, we all now know that Presidential nominating conventions, even as our Presidential primary elec-\u00b7 tions, are an essential part of the process of electing an American President, as important in their own way as is the general election in the fall. I would point out, in urging rejection of this amendment, that we already have public financing of national Presidential nominating conventions in this country because most of the money that finances these conventions comes from tax deductions for advertising, deductions that are taken by various business and labor groups for advertisements published in the convention programs that are distributed at the convention. So the present system is one whereby all of the taxpayers in the country involuntarily pay, through the tax deduction route, for the holding of conventions. However, under the language in the committee bill, only those taxpayers who voluntarily participate in the dollar check-off participate in supporting the public financing of our two national nominating conventions. A second point I would like to make, Mr. Chairman, is that the provision in the committee bill for the public financing of Presidential nominating conventions is the recommendation of the Bipartisan Commission on Convention Financing. This is not a partisan matter. The third point I would like to make, Mr. Chairmar~, is that utilization of public financing is voluntary on the part of the political parties. A political party is not mandated to receive public funds from the dollar check-off system, and if it does not wish to do so, it can use up to $2 million in private funds to finance its convention. Mr. Chairm&.n, it seems to me that if we retain the language in the committee bill, both with respect to Presidential nominating conventions and Presidential primaries, we shall be filling out the initiative that Congress undertook in 1972 in providing that, beginning in 1976, we shall have public financing of Presidential general elections. Surely, the events which are plaguing and afflicting all of the people of the United States now, Democrats and Republicans and Independents, in respect of the events associated with the 1972 ",

With his long experience as a leading Member of Congress, President Ford is uniquely qualified to work in mutual trust and harmony with the Congress, and in so doing to restore unity and confidence in government to the American people. As we offer our assistance to a new President, it is no less appropriate that we offer our best wishes to the departing President, Richard Nixon, along with an expression of appreciation for his contributions to world peace. As was evident. in his speech last night, that is what he hopes to be remembered for. And as one who opposed his Vietnam policy but later came to admire and support his creative and successful initiatives forpeace in relations with the Soviet Union and China and in the Middle East, I believe that hope will be realized.

It was on this crucial point that I was in very basic and strong disagreement with the Nixon administration. I am glad that they decided to listen, and to-finally--support this legislation. Medicaid and title IV -A programs are undesirable as primary vehicles for the provision of family planning services to women who are poor: These are programs in which eligibility is very narrowly defined. These are programs over which we Members of Congress have very little control. They make no pretense of having national standards of medical care. They are national only in the sense that they are made up of an aggregate of 50 welfare programs each having 50 varying State criteria for eligibility and quite different State standards of care. They are administered, for the most part, by State welfare agencies, some of which are not exactly known for their high level of concern for the health and well-being of low-i:qcome women or for their progressive policies with regard to such women and their personal privacy. I do not believe that State welfare agencies which staged midnight \"man in the house\" raids and have been known to threaten or actually force women off welfare rolls, can be trusted totally to insure voluntarism as a basic principle in the conduct of birth control programs. Even if they are, I am. sure that prospective patients would be leery of the intentions of these agencies and reluctant to participate in family planning programs sponsored by public assistance agencies. Furthermore, I fear that the suspicions of those who cry \"genocide\" would all too soon be reinforced if family planning services become too closely associated with these and other welfare programs. It is imperative from my viewpoint, that strong Federal direction and supervision be present in these programs at all times. Let me also point out that there is unanimous agreement that medicaid is an extremely expensive and ineffective program which has failed specifically to provide preventive health services. Many physicians refuse to treat medicaideligible patients, and the relatively few that do generally have incredibly busy practices with little time to give each patient. Women who are poor and must rely on medicaid for their health care needs are neither as knowledgeable nor can they afford to be as demanding of their physicians as can the average middleclass woman. Medicaid physicians canalways refuse services to any recipient if they so choose. We saw what happened in Aiken, S.C., when medicaid women refused to be bullied into sterilization. When the physicians who insisted on sterilization as a condition of their providing prenatal and obstetrical care to medicaid patients were condemned for their behavior, they simply refused to provide services to medicaid patients.

Meanwhile, Mr. President, the economic zone concept has emerged as the preeminent and pivotal issue before the Caracas conference and until an agreement is reached, debate on other policies will not proceed expeditiously. Ambassador Stevenson has also stressed passage of military vessels and aircraft through and over international straits as an issue of major concern. Not only unimpeded transit but nondiscretionary transit is essential to insure unrestricted passage in terms of ship typesubmarine, supertanker, nuclear powered-and destination of cargo. Currently however, debate on these urgent issues has not produced the substantive results anticipated. The licensing aspect of the seabed question has stalemated in committee 1. Committee 2, discussing the economic zone, may complete this session with only a comparative table, not significantly different from the Seabed Committee's report available at the beginning of the conference. Scientific research, handled in committee 3, may not only be subjected to regulation inside national jurisdiction, but outside as well. Ambassador Stevenson has expressed several misgivings concerning the present tum of discussions. Canada, Chile, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Mauritius, Mexico, New Zealand, and Norway have proposed that articles be drafted as a framework for discussion of archipelagic state's rights, territorial sea, economic zones and the continental staff. Ambassador Stevenson, however, holds that these proposed articles are too general for use as negotiable items. \u00b7 High seas freedom, particularly germane to the question of passage through international straits, has not been clearly preserved in proposals under consideration, according to Ambass,ador Stevenson. In addition, the Ambassador expressed reservations concerning the lack of compulsory dispute settlement provisions and absence of state duties insuring conservation and full utilization of fish stocks. Freedom of the seas has been fundamental to international law since the Dutch jurist Grotius established the principle in 1609. That principle however, derived from Grotius' view of a limitless expanse which \"can be neither seized nor enclosed,\" is not viable in a world of disparate interests seeking to exploit the ocean wealth. The major issues of resources, rights, and responsibilities immediately concern the nations of the world, and the Law of the Sea Conference is seeking to update ocean law to accommodate current and future world needs. Substantive progress in this direction, however, does not seem readily forthcoming. While the final Law of the Sea Treaty should receive our close attention and hopefully provide a step forward in an international approach to global needs, the self-interests of the United States in vital issues of ocean policy must not be ignored in our efforts to achieve international agreement.

            "754": "States balance of trade and payments. Economists had expected some lag, but it lasted longer than it was supposed to. Indeed, the dollar outflow quickened. The reason was the devaluation increased the dollar price of imports more than it reduced the volume of imports, especially as the American economy was expanding more rapidly and sucking 1n more imports. Simultaneously, devaluation cut the dollar price of American exports, causing foreign demand for cheaper American goods to boom; but the United States imposed export controls on soybeans and other agricultural goods, restricting the rise of its earnings abroad. Even more important, booming demand at home restricted the growth of United States exports. Hence the American trade position worsened in 1972, and dollars continued to flow overseas to cover the payments gap. The basic United States blunder was to think it could run a devaluation of the dollar without first slowing the economy. It did just ,the reverse-coupling devaluation with strong fiscal and monetary stimulus. The fixed-exchange-rate system could not survive the continuing dollar outflow. In early 1973, there was a second dollar devaluation, amounting .to 10 per cent, following a dramatic around-the-world :fllght by Under secretary of the Treasury Paul Volcker. But instead of calming the foreign-exchange markets, it rolled them further. And in late 'February and early March, dollars began to flood into West Germany because the mark looked like the safest port in a storm. The German central 'bank took in over $3-blllion a day, paying out marks to all comers in a vain attempt to keep the mark's exchange rate from rising. After dishing out more than $10--blllion worth of marks, German monetary omcials finally grew frightened of inflation and threw in the. sponge. They stopped defending the fixed exchange rate \u2022between the dollar and the mark; so the mark floated upward, and the dollar floated downward. The Bretton Woods fixed-rate system was dead; the whole world monetary system was afloat. But 1nftation was anything but dead. The loss of respect for the dollar, the key currency of the world monetary system, \u00b7brought on a flight from al\u00b7l currencies into anything precious and scarce that would hold its value in a time of monetary crisis-gold, sUver, platinum and many other commodities. Overnight it seemed as though the Club of Rome's long-range forecasts of the exhaustion of world resources were coming true in a rush, !Wlth soaring prices the fever gauge of commodity shortages. !Accidents of nature fed the commodity inflation. One of the weirdest was the disappearance of anchovies o1f the coast of Peru. Why this happened is still unclear. One theory is that the cause was the 1972-73 invasion of a warm-water current called El Nino, which upset the ecology of the coldwater Humboldt Current, drastically reducing the supply of plankton and other nutrients in which the anchovies feed. Most marine biologists doubt this, pointing out that El Nino comes roughly every seven years-it had last arrived in 1957 and 1962-but had not earlier \u2022seriously damaged the anchovy stock. Did an influx of predators eat the spawn? Were the young :flsh blown into hostUe waters? Nobody really knows. Whatever the explanation, as \u00a5organ Guaranty Bank economists correctly stressed, Peru's anchovy catch fell from more than 10 million tons to 2 million tons in 1973, wiping out a critical part of the world's :flshmeal supply, which is used to feed livestock. Bad growing weather for cereals, the !allure of much of the Soviet crop, the massive Soviet-American wheat deal-a key element in detente-exacerbated the commodlty inflation.

One method for testing the validity of fuis judgment is to look at who supports and who opposes the Brock bill. During recent hearings held by the House Banking Committee, 18 representatives of bar associations, title insurance companies, realtors, mo~ge lenders, and other providers of settlement services testified. All 18 supported the Stephens blll which is quite similar to the Brock bill. On the other hand, 7 consumer spokesmen or independent e\u00b7xperts testified on the closing cost issue.

Th9 conferees believe that this resolution of the model cities issue is fair both to the 147 model cities communities and to the many communities throughout the country which must be assured reasonable access to community development funds.

Although the specific provisions of the two bills differed in significant ways, the thrust of both bills was clearly to channel community development funds toward long-established and identified national goals. The conference report merged these differing provisions to clarify this intent. Each community applying for block grant funds must-First, identify its community development needs and objectives in accordance with areawide development planning and national urban growth policy; Second, formulate a program of activities to meet those needs, together with estimated costs and general location of such activities; and Third, submit a housing assistance plan (surveying the housing needs of lower-income persons, specifying the number of units or persons to be assisted including the proportion of new, rehabilitated, or existing units, and indicating the general location of housing for lower-income persons; and Fourth, describe a program of activities designed to eliminate or prevent slums, blight, and deterioration where such conditions or needs exist; and to provide improved community facilities and supporting health, social and similar services where necessary and appropriate.

It simply recognizes that the changeover to SSI has caused distortions and changes in the assistance offered through other programs, and insures that affected individuals will have the opportunity to state their cases. The proposed authority is similar to that which is already included in the supplemental security income program itself. The last section of my bill deals with a problem of particular importance to my Ohio constituents, although there certainly must be many aged, blind, and disabled persons in other States who are affected by the same problem. As I mentioned in my testimony last month, the prohibition in present law of SSI payments to inmates of public institutions, unless the institutions meet medicaid standards, is certainly having a disproportionate effect upon Ohio. In the first few months, there were many State-licensed but privately controlled institutions that had been under the impression that they were being classified as public, and they were receiving different signals from the district and national social security offices. Although this mixup apparently has been cleared up, there are still charges at the State level that the public institutions prohibition is being applied unnecessarily broadly and discriminatorily. Probably the most widespread effect of the provision in Ohio, however, is its elimination from SSI of about 1,500 residents of the 54 of Ohio's 66 county homes which presently do not meet medicaid standards. Many of these facilities are primarily residential, and I believe that serious questions can be raised about applying the public institutions prohibition to them. While the prohibition is logical when applied to inmates of institutions which it is the clear responsibility of State or local governments to provide, such as prisons, the rationale is less clear with respect to residential facilities, which do not have to be provided. The effect of the prohibition in such cases is to force governments, which assume the extra burden of providing them, either to turn away welfare level individuals most in need of their services or to meet medicaid requirements which they would not be forced to meet for the SSI purposes of their residents if they were privately operated. While the best answer for public medical facilities is certainly to upgrade these facilities to medicaid standards, medicaid standards are not necessarily fitting or feasible for all primarily residential facilities. In many cases these facilities have been considered to provide an adequate residence and place of general care for elderly people. In some areas, especially rural areas, the situation is further complicated by the lack of sufficient alternative facilities of this type. The bill would deal with these public institutions problems in two ways. First, it would state that any institution that was considered to be nonpublic for purposes of prohibition on welfare payments to inmates of public institutions under prior law, as of the last day it was in effect--last December 31-which ",

In a comparative renewal proceeding this presumption, of course, would give way to other compelling factors. In other words a licensee is in no sense of the word given a license in perpetuity. Third. Require the Commission to conduct a study to determine how it might expedite the elimination of those regulations of broadcast licensees required by the Communications Act which do not serve the public interest, and to make annual reports thereon, including any recommendations for legislation, to the Commerce Committees of the House and Senate. Fourth. Direct the FCC to complete docket 18110-multiple ownershiP-bY December 31, 1974. Mr. President, I believe this bill will further the larger and more effective use of radio and television by clarifying the broadcast license renewal standards and procedures in order to better inform broadcast licensees and their challengers of what is required under the public interest standard of the Communications Act. It will also better inform the listening and viewing public of what it may rightfully expect from those who are given the privilege of using the airwaves. Licensees who have received broadcast licenses and operated stations in accordance with Commission rules, regulations, and policies such as in crossownership, integration of management and ownership, should not find these factors injected into the renewal proceeding unless there has been a change of circumstances or a failure to comply or an abuse of the policy or rule. Under this legislation challenges are entitled to file competing applications at renewal time. Section 309(e) \u00b7of the Communications Act provides for a full hearing. Under those circumstances therefore the incumbent and a challenger are afforded an opportunity to submit all relevant data as to all applications and challenge any data that is submitted. After all the evidence is submitted and the hearings completed, the Commission will make a judgment as to whether incumbent has satisfied the criteria established by this legislation. If a finding is in the affirmative then a presumption is made on behalf of the existing licensee. This is a plus of major significance in the renewal proceeding. However, the FCC must take into account those factors which have a bearing on the public interest even though they are unrelated to program service or operation and consider them alongside the presumption. Thus, for example, to the extent the FCC has flexibility to deal with media concentration in a unique case, which ",

Mr. Chairman, the problem that this amendment addresses itself to is one that the gentleman froni Florida (Mr. FASCELL) the gentleman from Washington (Mr. FoLEY) and other Members of the House worked on for maybe 6 months. What we were trying to do was achieve maximum openness in meetings; but at the same time recognize certain limitations with respect to one kind of meeting' the markup session. What we ultimately decided is that a hearing ought to be open completely with the narrowest of exceptions, because a hearing produces the evidence that comes before the Congress, that the people of the United States are entitled also to know about, in order to determine why we made our decision and on what facts. There is not any excuse for closing a hearing for anything, except in narrow areas like that of national security. If there is a trade secret involved, the witness does not have to disclose it in the hearing. He can say he has a trade secret. Ordinarily nobody would push him on the point. If he insisted, he might even have the right to refuse to reveal it. Mr. !CHORD. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. ECKHARDT. Yes, surely. Mr. !CHORD. The gentleman there is only one place---Mr. ECKHARDT. I am getting to two others. . Mr. !CHORD. Does the gentleman not agree with the gentleman from California (Mr. Moss) that w~ are going to subject a person to ridicule by this process? Mr. ECKHARDT. If the gentleman will permit me, those are the other two points. There is one point on national security, one that recognizes that wholesome provision that was put into our rules in order to meet the old problem of the Dies Committee when persons were being investigated for alleged personal matters, and aprobrium resulted from their merely being called and interrogated in public as to whether they were Communists. Our rules say that hearings that would subject a person to aprobrium may be closed. The third exception is with respect to typical housekeeping matters within the House. What this does is enlarge the possibility of opening a hearing to another very broad exception. It says that a hearing may be closed if it will disclose information relating to trade secrets or financial or commercial information pertaining specifically to a given person, or the information is required to be kept secret in order to prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such person. So, what we are doing is giving the committee a right to close the hearing in a case which the present rules wm not permit the committee to close the hearing. The whole argument 'for openness was that no matter how much the committee wants to close the hearing, the committee should not be permitted to exclude the people of the United States from knowing what Congress was acting upon. It just passes my understanding that men can get in this well and say that: this amendment is for openness, that it 'increases openness, when in fact, as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. FASCELL), ",

To so pretend is to slough off to another part of the Government, with a hope and a whistle, our responsibility to promote the public welfare. I am tired of seeing the Congress give away its powers in such a fashion. I hope that, by now, my colleagues are as well. They can show it by voting to adopt this amendment. The Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Delaware, our colleagues, have so eloquently stated the case that there is not much I can add. to emphasize But the thing I wanted and underline, which has been stated well by both of my colleagues, is this matter of integration that we already suffer from the oil industry. The Senator from Delaware was kind enough to mention the fact that this has been bothering me for a long time in my efforts as a consumer advocate, as chairman of the Consumers Subcommittee. As we looked into this oil picture, we found out that the same companies are exploring for, drilling for, producing oil and transporting it to refineries, refining it and transporting it again to the retail outlets, and selling it at the retail outlets, and then we find it is controlled from the very ground right to the end, and the element of competition is gone. Now, the one thing that our whole economic structure in this country is built on, and the reason we say we have the best kind of economic structure, is competition, and competition is what enables us to get the lowest price for the consumer, on the one hand, and to require efficiencies and all kinds of improvements along the way by the producers and the sellers in order to deliver at the lower price. That is what we would be giving up here. I think the Senator from Delaware said it very eloquently. We already have concentration, why should we add one more facet to it, permitting the oil companies to own or control the deepwater ports? If we are going to have any opportunity in this country to bring petroleum prices down or back in range of consumer interests, we must do it through this competition factor. Therefore, I agree with my colleagues, both of whom have stated this so eloquently, that it is time we restored a measure of competition in this industry, at least in this facet, and also to show the people of our country, the people of the United States, that we do not simply sit back and let the oil companies go their way, the big integrated oil companies. Now, of course, they will continue to utilize this means of delivering oil to us. The bill itself recognizes that there is this element possibly of preference because it sets out the A, B, C listing and puts them finally down into the C category. I think that is an admission that there is this element of monopoly that would intrude into the delivery of oil that is imported into this country. Therefore, I strongly support the amendment that has been offered. I ",

No funds are presently included in the Supplemental for this purpose. Our amendment consists of the following: $400 m1llion for approximately 57,000 transitional public service jobs (at the Committee's estimate of $7,000 per annum per job) to be provided by some 400 State and local governmental prime sponsors under title I of CETA. (As passed by the Senate, the HEW-Labor appropriations bill for fiscal year 1975, now in Conference with the House, authorizes $1,505,000,000 for title I, of which $155,000,000 is intended by the Senate to provide approximately 22,000 public service jobs. The House provided $1,680,-000,000 for title I, which funds prime sponsors may use at their discretion for public service jobs or job training.) $100 million for approximately 14,000 transitional public service employment opportunities for areas of \"substantial unemployment\" (areas having an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent for more than three consecutive months) under title II of the Act, (Under the HEW-Labor Appropriations, as passed by the Senate, $400,000,000 would be available for approximately 57,000 jobs; the House bill provided $350,000,000, the amount of the Administration's request, for approximately 50,000 jobs.) We consider these additional funds to be crucial in Ugh t of the increase in the national unemployment rate from 5.4 percent in August with 4.9 persons unemployed, to 5.8 percent in September with 5.4 mill1on unemployment. Many experts, economists, and offi.cials in the Administration have predicted levels even higher, perhaps even as high as 6.0 percent, by the end of the year. Combined with our request, carried over fiscal year 1974 funds for public service employment, and those that would be available under the Senate version of the HEW-Labor Appropriations b111, an aggregate of about $1.5 b111ion for aproximately 226,000 public service job opportunties could be provided in this fiscal year. Yet that amount would reach only about 5.6 percent of the 5.4 mlllion currently unemployed. Experience under the public employment program (\"PEP\") conducted under the Emergency Employment Act of 1971, and more recently through the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973, demonstrates that transitional public service employment programs can provide meaningful, not \"dead-end\" employment for the unemployed, and meet real, not \"make-work\" pubHe servtce needs; most crucially, testimony before the Subcommittee on Employment, Poverty and Migratory Labor indicates that appropriated funds can be translated into worthwhile jobs within thirty days of allocation. This amendment will be otrered as a modiftcation to our original Amendment# 1957 to the Supplemental Appropriations Act (see attached). ",

Such peace is not possible for men and women unless they learn to master themselves, sublimate their combative energies into productive channels, refuse to accept enslavement in any form, and freely offer themselves in the service of their fellowmen and their eternal lord.

As we have pointed out in the past, the costs will rise even more if the private system is swallowed up by the Social Security system. Government bureaucracies are notoriously inefil.clent compared with private enterprise, and this will certainly be true in the administration of pension assets. Further, the Social Security system, at least as presently regulated, can't invest in corporate securities, or even treasury bills. It thus misses a chance to grow with the economy, or to earn higher returns. Companies will have no control over increases in benefits which they now negotiate with their employes. And they will have no say in the timing of the payments into the system. We believe that the pension industry-that is, pension fund trustees, administrators, managers and actuaries--can act to prevent the demise of the private pension system. The industry can first of all publicize the disastrous financial condition of the Social Security system to members of the private pension system, and explain what it means to the average worker. The workers should be told that the Social Security system at present is a giant chain letter which must get more expensive if it is not to break down sometime in the future, since there Will be fewer workers to carry the loa.d. Those who wm still be working in 1990 should be gravely concerned. This warning could be achieved through corporate communications programs and public relations efforts such as speeches at well-reported conferences. Further, the industry brought a great deal of pressure to bear in Washington in an effort to influence the shape of the pension reform legislation. A simtlar effort should be mounted to influence Congress to take a new look at the Social Security system-from its objectives to its methods and its future. Congress should be exposed to the work of actuaries such as Geoffrey Calvert, a consulting actuary in British Columbia, Robert Kaplan of Carnegie-Mellon University and Roman Weil of the University of Chicago. These men have exposed the Social Security system and the dangers it is presenting. Getting a member of Congress to vote against a Social Security increase is like asking for a vote against motherhood. Many members of Congress seem to think that such a vote would jeopardize their political futures. But this can be overcome if the industry can make a sufficient number of workers concerned about the condition of the system and how it could affect them. When the workers realize that if the company's private pension plan is absorbed by government system, their benefits at some stage will have to be reduced to a level lower then they now expect, Congress will hear about it. If action is taken immediately to better fund the system, taxes will have to rise by 50 or 75 percent, according to Kaplan and Well. But that much medicine now is better than a lot more later. And it would probably allow a reserve to be bullt up. This reserve could be invested in higher-return investments than the flower bonds, and the return might eventually lower costs. We believe reform of the Social Security system is an urgent rna tter deserving the attention and efforts of all who are interested in preserving the private pension system. We also belleve that united effort on the par:t of a.ll on lines suggested above wlll be effective 1n influencing Congress to ca.n-y out that reform. Let's not leave it until it is too ",

Further. the agriculture economy lies, at the heart of the viability of small communities. We are already aware that many rural banks have reduced their lending significantly and some have closed their doors for good. The financial liquidity of the family farm must be preserved if we are to assure adequate food supplies at fair and reasonable prices. As a result of this desperate situation, the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry has resolved that agricultural lenders immediately respond to the credit needs of agriculture. Chairman TALMADGE has resolved that immediately after the first of the year, the Committee will reexamine the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 in order to insure a fair return to the farmers. But unless agricultural lenders do their part now, those efforts will be too late. Therefore, all of those institutions which farmers rely on for credit must use every means possible to assure agricultural solvency-this includes the merchants who sell vital inputs for farming. Further, the Farmers Home Administration must fully implement all lending authority in law, including the Emergency Livestock Credit Act of 1974 and other disaster aid programs. The Farm Credit Administration must use its good offices to the fullest extent possible to insure that adequate credit is made available to farmers. Finally, the Federal Reserve Board must fully support those commercial banks which represent the largest source of farm production credit. Mr. President, I can understand that in these troubled economic times, many lenders might feel it wiser to restrict their loan activities sharply. But farmers continue to exist almost solely on the basis of huge annual loans which are essential to the production of food in this country. Any wavering in support for this credit system by any of the vital institutions involved will certainly produce famine abroad and much higher food prices at home. This is not to mention the disruption of farm families and rural communities. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has just completed the week-long exercise of its annual Outlook Conference. In my mind it was more of a back look conference, reflecting on what a good year last year was instead of the impending problems which any casual observer can foresee for the coming year in the entire food and fiber sector. If we cannot rely on the Department of Agriculture for this information, then it seems to me that it is incumbent upon Congress to come to some determination of how the problem of financial liquidity will affect the farmers themselves, the economy of rural areas and the American housewife. I intend to undertake a personal survey in my own State of Alabama, conversing with farmers, bankers, and merchants wherever I can find them. ",

We have heard from many people and have incorporated their ideas into our own analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the existing programs. The end result is a bill which significantly enhances our ability to deal with planning, implementation, and construction in a coordinated and effective fashion. The time for action is now and there is no reason to delay the implementation of the concepts expressed in S. 2994. To do so would mean that the Senate would be avoiding its responsibility and obligation to insure that programs are enacted which will benefit the total population. Furthermore, nonaction by the Senate will only perpetuate the uncertainty and instability that now faces 56 State comprehensive health planning agencies, 218 areawide comprehensive health planning agencies, 53 regional medical programs, 56 State Hill-Burton agencies, 17 experimental health services delivery systems, and their respective , constituencies. A third rationale for immediate action linked to the authority for developis ment activities . .AJ3 is well known, the regional medical programs have served as a vehicle for the development of a number of initiatives both on State and regional level.

This bill gives us the capacity to benefit from the strengths of the regional medical programs experience by supporting developmental projects which are responsive to the priorities set forth in a regional agency's short-term priorities plan. More importantly though this provision will allow communities to positively attack resource deficiencies that they all face in some form. Of even greater significance though is that the authority gives real meaning and substance to the planning that will be taking place.. In many parts of the country, under the existing comprehensive health planning program, planning agencies have been frustrated by their inability to get their planning priorities implemented in a viable format. There has been no mandated link between the planning under comprehensive health planning and the development under regional medical programs. S. 2994 rectifies this very condition. Furthermore, if we think back to the earlier discussion about the ties between national health insurance and planning and resource needs, we see the real promise this provision holds. \u00b7 Another reason for an immediate decision on this bill rests on the question of need for facilities and services. For a number of years this country has wrestled with the problem of how to get facilities and services into areas where they are needed.

The nominee says that was an abuse in the past that no longer will occur because New York has passed laws preventing that and the Federal Government has passed laws preventing that. I then asked the nominee: \"Do you agree that was an abuse at the time it was being exercised by you?\" And the nominee said, \"Well, legal.\" I said, \"That really was not the question. Was it ethical? Was it an ethical use of your private wealth?\" The nominee said that he equated that particular issue of morality with legality. And then the most incredulous testimony of all contained in this record came when I asked the nominee if his testimony before our committee was testimony of direct recollection or if his testimony was testimony of reconstruction. He said it was all reconstruction. There was no direct recollection in his testimony. I said, \"This committee has just been through an episode of listening to one of the most famous voices in this land, the former President of the United States, on tape, advising his staff people how to testify before congressional committees under oath or before courts; and the way to testify, the former President of the United States, Mr. Nixon, said, was to say, 'You don't recall.' \" Reconstruct or reconstruction, no direct recollection. Those are precisely the words the nominee used before our committee. I am suggesting to the House that if the Members have an opportunity to read this record, they will find and conclude as I have, and as did many of the 12 members constituting the majority of the Democrats on that committee, that the nominee, charitably, was less than candid before our committee. It just simply is not correct, as the nominee says, that the loans he made were, in fact, loans. It was apparent, and the nominee admitted, that he made gifts to these individuals prior to their obtaining public employment and subsequent to their leaving public employment. But he made \"loans\" in the intervening intervals between obtaining public employment and ending public employment. Moneys given by the nominee to these officials were denominated as loans, loans not containing any interest or bearing any collateral, and loans inevitably forgiven when the nominee left public office so that they could be converted into a gift without violating a statute of New York.

As a part of this paralysis, an easy out, a wealth herring has been created. Many proponents make it sound like those who oppose Mr. Rockefeller apply a wealth test. This is not so. His wealth has clearly raised questions over misuse of that wealth and power which has come from that wealth but I do not, nor do many opponents I have heard, apply a wealth test to the nominee. I think it important to maintain the same standard for Nelson Rockefeller as maintained for others. That standard is not being maintained , because of a strange paralysis of will. In closing, I wish to ask my fellow Republican colleagues, do you plan to vote for a man who as Governor was an advocate of those same liberal policies-big government spending, bigger welfare schemes, and other liberal nostrumsthat have led this country to its present economic mess? The Republican Party has repeatedly rejected Rockefeller. Public support for his nomination is lacking. I particularly reject the Republican attitude of quote-If President Ford wants him, we should support him-unquote. This set of blinders on my Republican friends led our party to near disaster in the sordid Watergate affair and should not be repeated here as a test of loyalty. At a time the American people are weary of politics, polticians, and pas.t failures of both parties, we should be holding out some bright new hope in this rare opportunity afforded by the 25th amendment. There is no hope for change in a Nelson Rockefeller. He represents the type of spending and taxing politician we should have had enough of. A legislative paralysis has precluded a real study of the nominee. It is one of the reasons for the decline in respect for this great body. I urge a \"No\" vote. Many issues liave never really been studied. One issue is the military draft. Nelson Rockefeller was No. 10 on his local draft board but was appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt to a newly created Government post. Was the draft just one more thing that applied to average Americans but not to Nelson Rockefeller? Another issue that has received little attention is Rockefeller and Chase Manhattan Bank involvement in the World Trade Center in New York City. The New York State government is paying $16 million a year in rent for space in that building while other previously built State buildings are sitting partially or totally empty. Is there a confiict of interest in this matter? I do not know but the possibility has not been investigated. A third area where numerous questions remain is the case of L. Judson Morhouse. Senator HELMS has pointed out a' number of inconsistencies and discrepancies in this whole case and in how Nelson Rockefeller related it. Has Nelson\u00b7 Rockefeller candidly related the Morhouse story? Has this issue been dealt with fully and accurately? Another area deals with American sovereignty and vital American interests.

Mr. Speaker, a giant of the Congress, indeed the Nation, has decided to leave public service and enter a well-deserved retirement. Congressman CHET HOLIFIELD, the chairman of the Government Operations Committee, the chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, and the dean of the California delegation, stepping down after 32 years of dedicated and devoted service to this Nation. And over those years, the list of achievements is virtually endless-but at the top of the list, one would have to place his efforts toward the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and his leadership modernizing the Government. Not only has CHET HOLIFIELD been a national leader, he has been an international leader, recognized around the world as an expert on nuclear energy. Since 1955, he has served\u00b7 on the U.S. Delegation to the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. At international conferences held from 1957 through 1970, he has been instrumental in efforts to use nuclear power in a safe, efficient method for the good of mankind. In the Congress, his leadership on the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy has led to many Sidvances in the field of energy derived from atomic power. And these Sidvances could effectively serve the energy needs of future generations. In addition, as the chairman of the Government Operations Committee, CHET has worked for an efficient, responsive Government that meets the needs of the people it serves. As a businessman, engaged in the manufacture and selling of men's apparel, CHET has used these commonsense business techniques to bring economy to the Government.

            "1204": "Ever since I can remember I have loved drawing and painting. At the age of four years I drew a mountainous landscape, the like of which I have not since equalled, if the satisfaction and pride which I felt at that time are to be accepted as criterions. The quite startling understanding of distance and significance which those receding mountain peaks, each topped by a fine eagle, gave to me was one of the important experiences in my, until then, level existence. This proved to be but a first happening, in a. chain of adventures, which seem to have put me in direct contact with an unexpected variety of artistic sources. Many of the unaccountable incidents and vicissitudes, which came to me in subsequent years, had no \u00b7apparent connection with art, and yet from them I have \u00b7 been permitted tO build a delibe;ate and not unfounded point of view, which, taken together with a conscientious attempt to secure technical freedom, have resulted in my present attitude towards aesthetics and towards art. It is the contact with many cycles and sources which leads me to believe in the desirability of a diversity of style, by which the artist may more fully reflect his own impulse and his understanding of the tendencies characterizing various artistic traditions. I always consider butterflies as my main instructors in Art. Since childhood I have made paintings of them, endeavoring to reproduce every shade of their color, and every minute detail of pattern. Naturally, my eye has been trained to notice the slightest vari\u00b7ations in this respect. The question of ornamental value of the butterfly's wings attracted me as one of the mo.st fascinating problems connected with my fravorite branch of entomology. Together with systematic and biological investigations, I regard as most instructive the study of the laws of color and the patte.rn variations and interconnections exhibited by the butterfly wings, which after all, represent the unique phenomenon ln nature of a rigid, flat and ornamented .mrface, stretched onto veins. This surface is devoid of any marked structural irregularity. The study of each pattern infinitely varies though manifestly subject to certain laws of balance, symmetry, ornamental repetitions in the very intricaite striation, peculiar ocellation and elaborate border designs-and discloses wonderfully 1lluminating material on decoration as pure crystallization of natural ornament, independent of any epoch or national taste. Perhaps one of the most instructive features of the coloring of butterflys' and moths' wings, is not so much how the colors are matched, as in what proportion of relative areas, equal or interrupted, they are combined. The elements of quality and quantity are here equally significant. One can find, on these winged jewels, examples of dynamic symmetries, \"constructi veisms,\" \"suprematism,\" so much spoken about now-a-days, and a great deal more besides, never dreamed by any modernistprophet. I decidedly consider a close and thoroughly systematic study of color rotations and pattern variations of lepidopera, most valuable guide for developing a sense of color composition and a feeling for harmonious and natural ornamentation. Besides the scientific interest and gra.t1\u00b7 fication which I derived from entomology, I feel myself immeasurably indebted in my work as an artist, to the winged creatures that received from the ancient Greeks the fitting name of Psyche. Voyaging about the world brought me in contact again, at a mature age, with the magic and charm of Asia.tic art. It was a true inspiration to admire the glories of India-Buddhist, Hindu and Mahometanthe phantasmagorical temples of South India, the grace and abstract perfection of Mogul art, the fascinating mystery and pro-"
